        "topic_name": "Innovative Neuroscience K-12 Education",
        "description": "\n\t1. Research Objectives\n\n\tThe NIH
Blueprint for Neuroscience Research is a framework to enhance
cooperative activities among the NIH Office of the Director and 15 NIH
Institutes and Centers that support research on the nervous system (for
further information, see
http:\/\/neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov\/).&amp;nbsp; This Funding
Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is released in affiliation with the
Neuroscience Blueprint, with Institutes and Centers participating
independently.&amp;nbsp; This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA)
encourages Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant applications
from small business concerns (SBCs) that propose to develop innovative
neuroscience educational tools to be used by or benefit children in
kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12).&amp;nbsp; Educational tools can
be designed using any media (e.g., paper, electronic, web-based, etc.)
or format (e.g., simulations, games, videos, teaching toolboxes, etc.)
for use in or out of school settings, targeting children in groups or
alone, with or without adult or teacher participation.&amp;nbsp;
Innovative neuroscience educational tools should promote neuroscience
knowledge acquisition and application of that knowledge to
one&amp;rsquo;s own life, promote an interest in neuroscience learning
and careers, and present a positive and realistic representation of the
diversity of people who engage in neuroscience-related research and
occupations.&amp;nbsp; Educational tools targeted to increase the
diversity of students (i.e., Native American, Black, Hispanic, female,
disabled, or otherwise underrepresented) pursuing neuroscience learning
are especially encouraged.\n\n\tNeuroscience is the study of the
peripheral and central nervous system, including the brain, sensation
and perception, cognition, emotions, and behavior.&amp;nbsp; Many allied
 science domains contribute importantly to the neuroscience field,
including biology, psychology, anatomy, chemistry, genetics, physics,
anthropology, pharmacology, informatics and computer sciences, zoology,
developmental sciences, bioengineering, medical sciences, and
physiology.&amp;nbsp; Because neuroscience incorporates so many
scientific domains, neuroscience learning provides a significant
platform for basic and fundamental science learning, including learning
scientific methods, observation, experimentation, analysis, evaluation
and reasoning.\n\n\tNeuroscience careers contribute importantly to the
U.S. economy.&amp;nbsp; Medical and allied health professional careers
depend on neuroscience advances for providing new treatments and
prevention of many of the major medial conditions now affecting the
American public, such as Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s dementia, stroke, pain
disorders, obesity, alcohol and other substance abuse disorders,
depression, autism and other mental health disorders, and most
developmental disorders.&amp;nbsp; The pharmaceutical and biomedical
industries require neuroscientists to aid in new drug\/technology
development and safety testing.&amp;nbsp; Educators and policymakers
rely on neuroscience findings to provide evidence-based support for
educational initiatives and interventions.\n\n\tWith neuroscience
permeating such diverse areas of importance for all Americans, it is
essential that the U.S. public better understand what neuroscience is
and how neuroscience research can contribute importantly to their
understanding of these issues.&amp;nbsp; Early exposure to neuroscience
concepts and findings may enhance this goal and advance the aims of this
 funding opportunity.\n\n\tU.S. students are underachieving in
international assessments of science knowledge and
understanding.&amp;nbsp; In response, in November 2009, the Office of
the President launched the &amp;ldquo;Educate to Innovate&amp;rdquo;
campaign, a nationwide effort to move American students over the next
decade from the middle to the top of the pack in science and math
achievement.&amp;nbsp; The present FOA compliments this Presidential
initiative to advance science learning and reasoning in K-12
children.\n\n\tThis underachievement is especially pronounced in
minority, disadvantaged, and disabled students.&amp;nbsp; The
representation of these disadvantaged groups in higher levels of science
 training is likewise disproportionately low, with neuroscience training
 following similar patterns.&amp;nbsp; Further, beginning in early
adolescence, girls from all cultural, ethnic, or socioeconomic groups
are less represented in science courses, activities and career paths,
despite comparable performance to boys in assessments of learned science
 material.&amp;nbsp; Nearly half the U.S. workforce is female, yet less
than one quarter of U.S. scientists are women.&amp;nbsp; Although not
required, applicants responding to this funding opportunity are
encouraged to address one or more of these disparities in neuroscience
interest and learning.\n\n\tThe presentation of diverse (cultural,
racial, gender, ability, and life roles) populations engaged in
neuroscience learning, activities, and research may facilitate the goal
of attracting diverse children to neuroscience learning.&amp;nbsp;
Providing diversity of role models is an important strategy for
enhancing interest and motivation, these are important goals of this
funding opportunity announcement.\n\n\tApplications appropriate for to
this announcement will:\n\n\t\n\t\tevelop innovative neuroscience
educational tools for K-12 children.&amp;nbsp; Tools should use learning
 strategies appropriate to the age of the target learners; not all grade
 levels must be targeted by any one project.\n\t\n\t\tPromote
application of neuroscience knowledge and scientific reasoning to self
and one&amp;rsquo;s own life\/understanding of the experienced
world.\n\t\n\t\tPromote neuroscience interest and careers.\n\n\n\tAll
applicants are strongly encouraged to address how their proposed tool
will:\n\n\t\n\t\tPromote interest in and motivation for neuroscience
learning in diverse groups of children, especially those children from
underrepresented groups.\n\t\n\t\tPresent a diversity of persons
(gender, race, culture, ability, life roles) engaged in learning,
applying, and\/or conducting neuroscience research (as appropriate to
the developed tool).\n\n\n\tKey to a successful application will be the
use of innovative learning\/teaching strategies.&amp;nbsp; Proposals
that replicate existing traditional teaching strategies but using
neuroscience content will be judged of lower priority.&amp;nbsp; This
FOA encourages proposals grounded in learning theory and
experimentally-derived evidence, but using exciting and innovative
strategies.&amp;nbsp; Applicants are strongly encouraged to explore what
 tools and strategies are already under development and\/or are
available in order to assess their own innovativeness before proposing
their own tool.&amp;nbsp; Government funded websites that may be
especially helpful in this background search include, but are not
limited to:\n\n\t\n\t\tNIH RePORTer (http:\/\/report.nih.gov\/)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tNIH Science Education Nation
(http:\/\/science.education.nih.gov\/NIHSciEdNation)
&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tScienceEducation.gov
(http:\/\/www.scienceeducation.gov\/)\n\t\n\t\tNational Science
Foundation (http:\/\/nsf.gov\/) &amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tU.S. Gov for Science
 (http:\/\/www.science.gov\/) &amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\tBroadly conceived
neuroscience learning is more appropriate to the goal of this funding
opportunity announcement than are disease- or condition-specific
tools.&amp;nbsp; For example, while the pharmacology of substance abuse
may be an excellent platform for learning several neuroscience
principles and has applicability to a child&amp;rsquo;s life, this focus
 would be judged too narrow.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, this FOA
encourages a tool that addresses multiple neuroscience topics such as
neuroanatomy and neuropharmacology, and then references substance abuse
as an example.\n\n\tAlthough process evaluation (e.g., number and types
of children exposed to the developed tool, how many children identified
&amp;ldquo;liking&amp;rdquo; the tool, hours spent using the tool,
number of communities implemented the tool, breath of information
presented by tool, etc.) is important, this FOA encourages applicants to
 also plan for and conduct an outcomes evaluation that will use
objective measurement (e.g., level of new learning as a result of
developed tool, change of attitude\/interest in neuroscience career,
ability to use learned information in novel example of decision making,
etc.)\n\n\tEducational tools can be designed using any media (e.g.,
paper, electronic, web-based, etc.) or format (e.g., simulations,
&amp;ldquo;serious&amp;rdquo; games, videos, teaching toolboxes,
etc.).&amp;nbsp; Although classrooms are often thought of as the most
typical placement for learning tools, learning occurs in many
environments where the &amp;ldquo;teacher&amp;rdquo; may not be a
physically present adult.&amp;nbsp; Applications need not be confined to
 classroom or school-based teaching tools or tools that address children
 in a group setting.&amp;nbsp; Nor are developed tools required to
engage an adult in the learning process, although engagement of a
parent, teacher, older sibling, or other person in the child&amp;rsquo;s
 life may be viewed as a valuable addition.&amp;nbsp; Whether or not
engaging adults in the learning process, this FOA encourages tools that
successfully engage and motivate the child learner.&amp;nbsp; In all
cases, because the SBIR mechanism requires a marketing plan, how
children will be accessed and who other essential persons are who can
facilitate or inhibit access to those children and are the potential
purchasers of the tool, should be carefully considered and
addressed.\n\n\tAlthough not an exhaustive list, the following are
illustrative examples of proposals that would be considered appropriate
for to this funding opportunity announcement:\n\n\t\n\t\tVirtual reality
 tour of brain mechanisms involved with learning and memory and\/or
their changes across the lifespan\n\t\n\t\tSerious game teaching about
action potentials, neurotransmission, and motor
function\n\t\n\t\tTeaching toolbox for hands-on neuroscience experiments
 for K-3 students\n\t\n\t\tInteractive web page education on
developmental neuroscience\n\t\n\t\tVideo\/documentary on environmental
influences on the brain, behavior and emotion\n\t\n\t\tInteractive
whiteboard exploration of sensation and perception\n\t\n\t\tEducational
computer games about neuroplasticity and neurodegeneration\n\n\n\tSee

 These carbon sequestration and storage capabilities are important
ecosystem services that if incorporated into management and planning can
 increase the protection and restoration of these habitats and allow for
 their inclusion in carbon markets. Key first steps to leverage carbon
services to increase habitat conservation are to have a better
understanding of exactly how much carbon is being sequestered or emitted
 from these ecosystems as well as how much is stored in the sediments
from historical accumulation.  Accurate data on these carbon services
(and areal extent of habitats) are critical to support the development
of carbon sequestration\/storage protocols for coastal wetlands and to
support efforts to incorporate carbon services of these habitats into
Federal decision-making. The collection of more accurate data on carbon
services will be facilitated by the development of an easy-to-use

In addition there are potential beneficiaries of the development of this

Accurate and rapid measurements of carbon sequestration, emissions, and

development of voluntary carbon markets which in turn can provide
private sector funding that support habitat conservation goals. The

easy to use and inexpensive detection methodologies which allow resource

from harmful algae. One approach to developing such technologies which
has shown great promise is the use of electrochemical detection. A major
 advantage of these technologies is that they provide an unambiguous
digital readout. This contrasts with current field test technologies
which depend largely on interpretation of color change in order to
estimate toxin concentrations. The primary impediment to broadly
employing this technology to water, fish and shellfish toxin analysis is
 that the typical electrode design depends on incubating a small amount
of sample on top of a fixed electrode surface. Having to use a small
volume of sample often limits the sensitivity of the assay such that
only toxin levels at or above the regulatory limit can be reliably
measured. To overcome these limitations, we are seeking proposals for
the development of a flow through membrane-based electrode technology

calcification rates are not ideal. The most common measures changes in
total alkalinity by titration followed by using assumptions and
equations to calculate the change in [Ca+2]. Measuring skeletal
incorporation of radioactive Ca+2 is hazardous and difficult to use for

that stop dividing within 24-72 hrs and are only viable for weeks.
Marine invertebrates have been recalcitrant to in vitro cell culture,
illustrating the need for innovative solutions. Overcoming this barrier
will address identifying risk factors for threatened coral species by
providing a toxicological tool for screening environmental toxicants in
marine waters. Coral cell lines will open research in cell biology,
virology, genetics, biochemistry and physiology for clearer
understanding of natural processes and pathologies. Providing an
alternative to wild-harvested corals is a significant contribution to
conservation and management of these marine resources. Industry can also
 benefit from the ability to screen, select and produce novel compounds.
 Clearly with the need to identify causes of global coral reef decline,
such a technological breakthrough would provide an invaluable tool to
elucidate causes and devise interventions. Because coral are basal
metazoans with genes more closely related to humans than other
invertebrate model organisms (e.g., Drosophila and C. elegans) having
genetically distinct immortalized coral cell lines would broaden the
commercial market, providing an alternative to the classical
invertebrate models.",

the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the oceans. For example,
measurement-based estimates of air-sea CO2 fluxes still have &gt;50%

attributed to the difficulty in sampling the global ocean with
sufficient spatial and temporal coverage. To further the understanding

dynamics, intensive, year-round monitoring is required.\n\nAutonomous
sensors for pH and pCO2 have been developed over the past decade and are
 becoming more widely used for oceanographic research.  However, an
integrated autonomous pH and pCO2 platform is not currently commercially
 available.  The most important and immediate need is to obtain sea
surface pCO2 and pH measurements in the surface ocean.   The surface
float technology for integration of these sensors is well advanced.
Availability of a surface pH-pCO2 float will make possible the
development of an Argo-like CO2 monitoring network, which does not

become increasingly concerned about the amount of energy used, and
therefore greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated, to provide water
services (i.e., drinking water and waste water) to their consumers.  At
the same time, many utilities are faced with the potential for long-term
 climate change impacts on water quality, availability, and built
infrastructure for water delivery and management.  Potential water
quality and quantity impacts include saline intrusion into coastal
aquifers and loss of freshwater flows due to inland droughts and
increasing demand. Infrastructure threats arise from potential damage
due to sea level rise and increased frequency and severity of storms and
 flooding.  Finally, an important issue to consider is the possibility
that collection, distribution, and treatment systems located along the
coast will be constantly flooded, or would be completely under the new
water table and would have to be re-located.  Increasing climate-related
 risk is forcing adaptation discussions and action.  \n\nGiven new
public awareness; a desire to reduce GHG by local, state and federal
entities; a need to develop new tools\/approaches to adapting to a
changing sea level and climate; and the reality of the cost of
adaptation and mitigation to utilities, the results of this project
would benefit a number of utilities, particularly in coastal areas who
are already (or soon will be) addressing these pressing issues.  The
primary objective of this project would be to provide utilities with the
 tools and technologies they need to effectively and economically adopt
adaptation strategies that reduce energy use, protect the quality and
quantity of water supplies (especially from saline intrusion into
coastal drinking water aquifers), and reduce the potential damage to
infrastructure from climate-related risks. \n\nWhile a limited number of
 existing tools address individual aspects of adaptation or mitigation,
decision makers are seeking tools and technologies to help them make
optimal decisions to meet multiple goals, including how to build
resilience to the multiple threats without increasing energy use.  This
need was articulated at a recent workshop hosted by NOAA, EPA, NASA, the
 Water Research Foundation, and the Water Environmental Research
Foundation titled \u201cThe Future of Research on Climate Change Impacts
 on Water: A Workshop Focusing on Adaptation Strategies and Information
Needs\u201d held in August 2010.   For more information see:
\nwww.waterrf.org\/projectsreports\/publicreportlibrary\/4340.pdf.\n\nThe
 research products should seek to address some combination of water
quality and quantity or mitigation and adaptation simultaneously, and
could include methods and technologies to: optimize carbon and water
footprinting of adaptation approaches, reduce energy intensity of water
treatment and movement, generate energy at the treatment facility and
develop means of becoming net-zero energy users, create an
ecological\/environmental footprint metric, and\/or develop and use
non-conventional water sources.",

state-of-the-art data discovery systems. Current geospatial search
systems are far from ideal, especially for novice users encountering a
steep learning curve. A simple, easy to use interface is characteristic
of popular Internet search engines. But, these open domain search
engines are created primarily for largely unstructured data (web pages)
and rely primarily on keyword matching. This frequently results in low
precision even for well posed questions. The geospatial data is largely
structured data. Significant effort is spent standardizing data formats
and developing rich metadata suitable for the designated user community.
 With the recent developments in natural language query processing and
semantic web technologies, high precision natural language query
processing systems could be developed on such largely structured data.

Colorimetric Assay to Measure Cyanopyrethroid Insecticides on Treated
Fabrics and Walls",
        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n
Insecticide-based interventions are used in many vector control programs
 worldwide for managing diseases such as malaria and dengue.\n
Insecticide-impregnated fabrics, (e.g. bed nets, curtains and clothing),
 as well as insecticide spraying onto walls (indoor residual spraying)
have\n        been shown to be effective in reducing vector-borne
disease transmission by providing an insecticidal barrier against
disease-transmitting vectors .\n        Monitoring of insecticide levels
 provides critical information about the quality of vector control
interventions, for formulating strategies and\n        focusing control
efforts. However there is currently no rapid field-deployable assay(s)
to monitor the effectiveness of insecticides used in these\n
control methods. Pyrethroids are commonly used in indoor residual
spraying (IRS) programs and deltamethrin\/ permethrin are the only two
pyrethroids\n        approved for treated fabrics. Gas or
high-performance liquid chromatography provides the most sensitive means
 of pyrethroid analysis. The standard WHO\n        cone bioassays for
evaluating efficacy of insecticides in IRS and for bed nets requires
access to a colony of susceptible mosquitoes. These techniques\n
are neither practical nor affordable (labor\/resource intensive and\/or
require highly trained personnel) in countries where
insecticide-treated\n        materials or IRS are being implemented. A
sensitive quantitative colorimetric assay with an innovative sampling
technique (simple rubbing of filter\n        paper on material surface)
to measure cyanopyrethroid (e.g. deltamethrin, \u03bb-cyhalothrin,
\u03b1-cypermethrin, cyfluthrin, etc.) levels on bed nets has been\n
    developed at the CDC Entomology Branch and has proven to be robust
and sensitive (Trop. Med. &amp;amp; Int. Health Vol 14, pp 1-8, 2009).
The next step is\n        to further develop this technique into
field-usable assay(s) capable of determining and quantifying pyrethroid
levels for monitoring vector-control\n        interventions.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        Public Health Impact:\n        Insecticides are
still the mainstays of vector-borne disease control. With malaria
elimination back on the global agenda, there has been an expansion\n
    of IRS and a dramatic increase of insecticide-treated bed net
distribution for vector suppression and reducing transmission. Technical
 and operational\n        obstacles for successful vector control
operations include technical quality of IRS, effective life of the
insecticide on sprayed surfaces and levels\n        of pyrethroids in
bed nets. Sub-optimal levels of insecticides also increase the potential
 of insecticide resistance developing in the vectors.\n
Field-usable assays are key to accurately and rapidly monitor
insecticide-based approaches and to prevent resistance to the
insecticide.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Examples of specific
research areas of interest include, but are not limited to:\n
Development of field-usable assay(s) capable of determining and
quantifying pyrethroid levels for monitoring vector-control
interventions. The assay(s)\n        should be easy to operate,
inexpensive, portable, use heat stable reagents and have no special
storage requirement. The focus of current\n        cyanopyrethroid assay
 has been for deltamethrin in treated bed-nets. However another
cyanopyrethroid, \u03b1-cypermethrin, and a non-cyanopyrethroid,\n
  permethrin is also used for bed nets. In addition a number of
pyrethroids are used for IRS. Of particular interest to CDC are assays
capable of\n        detecting pyrethroids currently used on bed-nets,
and pyrethroids detection assays that can be used for monitoring IRS
programs used for different\n        housing materials.\n    \n",

Parasite Detection in the Field and Innovative Tools for the Detection

        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n        Malaria
continues to be a global public health challenge contributing to at
least an estimated 800,000 deaths and more than 240 million clinical\n
      illnesses affecting mostly young children in Sub-Saharan Africa
and other tropical countries. Development of resistance to cheap
antimalarial drugs\n        such as chloroquine and
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine has led to adoption of artemisinin based
combination therapy (ACT) which is more expensive. Recently\n        the
 World Health Organization has recommended evidence based treatment
(based on confirmed diagnosis of parasites) for malaria instead of
basing\n        treatment on symptoms. However, microscopic diagnosis is
 not feasible in many endemic countries setting and there is a greater
need for alternative\n        diagnostic tools for malaria. Although
immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been used for
malaria diagnosis, these tests have\n        limitations in correctly
identifying malaria species and recently the emergence of parasite
populations lacking the most commonly used diagnostic\n        antigen
HRP-2. In addition, there is a concerted effort through various public
and private efforts (such as U.S. President\u2019s Malaria Initiative,
U.N.\n        Millennium Development Goals, Gates Foundation etc) to
reduce malaria burden to very low levels, including elimination of
malaria wherever possible. As\n        these efforts progress there is
increased realization that there is a need for more sensitive field
diagnostic tools to diagnose low density infections\n        that
contribute to ongoing transmission but which are not detected by RDTs or
 microscopy.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Since 2006, 38 countries
in sub-Saharan Africa and most other endemic countries have adopted an
ACT regimen for the primary treatment of uncomplicated\n        malaria
due to P. falciparum infection. Although it was hoped that ACT would
remain efficacious for a number of years until the next generation\n
    of antimalarials would become available, very recent surveillance
data from the Thailand-Cambodia border have raised the alarming specter
of declining\n        efficacy of ACTs. Initially it was hoped that
resistance was due to declining efficacy for the artemisinin partner
mefloquine. Unfortunately,\n        additional recent research has shown
 that resistance to artemisinin has emerged. In the past molecular
markers have proven to be useful molecular tools\n        for tracking
resistant parasites and there is greater need to adopt simpler field
usable platforms for conducting molecular surveillance for monitoring\n
       emergence and spread of resistant parasites. Currently, there are
 no available molecular markers for artemisinin resistance. In addition,
 available\n        molecular tools are expensive and not available for
use in endemic countries, requiring shipment of samples to developed
countries for analysis.\n        Therefore, there is a need to develop
field usable immunologic, molecular and other tools for malaria
diagnosis and for detecting resistant parasites.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        Public Health Impact:\n        \u00a0 Availability of
diagnostic tests with greater sensitivity can help to identify
subclinical infections, reduce transmission, and monitor success of\n
     control programs. Development of field usable tools for the
surveillance of drug resistant parasites will help to develop
appropriate public health\n        policies to combat resistance.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        Examples of specific research areas of
interest include, but are not limited to:\n        \u00a0 1) Development
 of highly sensitive, specific and field usable tests for malaria
parasite detection for use in malaria control programs for mass\n
 screening. 2) Development of molecular tools that can simultaneously

infections, can be targeted\n        effectively through mass
chemotherapy. These NTDs are not considered to cause appreciable
mortality; however, they are associated with high levels of\n
morbidity because of the chronic nature of many of the infections.
Blindness and disability due to these NTDs increase in prevalence with
age, reducing\n        the productivity of adults. Intestinal helminths,
 among the commonest of infections, have profound effects on the growth
and cognitive development of\n        children. The past five years have
 seen significant increases in the number of countries implementing NTD
programs and in the number of persons being\n        treated. These
increases are the direct result of generous donations of drugs from
pharmaceutical manufacturers and new funding support from USAID and\n
     DFID, among others. Reducing the morbidity caused by NTDs is an
objective of the Global Health Initiative and the global elimination of
lymphatic\n        filariasis and trachoma are specific GHI targets.
Available diagnostic tools for lymphatic filariasis, trachoma,
schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis and\n        intestinal helminth
infections do not at present meet the needs of the control programs.\n
  \n    \n    \n    \n        Public Health Impact:\n        \u00a0
Development of improved diagnostic tools would enhance the commitment of
 donors and policy makers to the control and elimination programs for
NTDs by\n        providing higher quality information and increased
confidence that public health goals are being met. Significant savings
in human and financial\n        resources could be obtained through the
development of improved diagnostic tools.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
   Examples of specific research areas of interest include, but are not
limited to:\n        \u00a0 For diseases addressed by mass drug
administration (MDA), diagnostic tests are needed to guide programmatic
decisions on community treatment. Despite\n        the molecular
revolution in biology, little of the new found knowledge of parasite
genes and gene products is being translated into tools than can be\n
    used in the field to guide program decisions. Tools for mapping and
monitoring program impact are still conventional parasitologic methods,
based on\n        microscopy. These tests lack sensitivity and are not
adequate for NTD programs with elimination endpoints. New antibody tests
 could provide more\n        sensitive tools to monitor transmission,
facilitate decision-making and conduct surveillance. The potential
advantages of antibody-based tests for\n        post-MDA surveillance
argue that increased efforts also should be made to develop a standard
platform for such tests, opening opportunities for\n        integrated
surveillance for NTDs.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        For CGH

    Cancer Etiology. The Cancer Etiology Branch (CEB) supports research
that seeks to determine the role of chemical, physical and biological
agents\n        as factors or cofactors in the etiology of human and
animal cancer. The biological agents of primary interest are DNA
viruses, RNA viruses, AIDS and\n        AIDS-associated viruses,
although the research may encompass all forms of life including bacteria
 and other microbial agents associated with cancer and\n        use
animal models of cancer and cancer vaccines. Chemical Carcinogenesis
studies are concerned with cancers initiated or promoted by chemical
or\n        physical agents. A wide range of approaches are supported,
including studies of the genetics of cell transformation, mutagenesis,
tumor promotion and\n        DNA damage, as well as studies of basic
biochemistry and molecular biology of oncogenic and suspected oncogenic
agents, viral oncogenes and associated\n        tumor suppressor genes,
pathogenesis and natural history studies, animal models, and preventive
vaccine research. Mechanistic studies are encouraged in\n        areas
such as metabolism, toxicity and physiological distribution of
carcinogens, genetics and regulation of enzymes, biochemical and
molecular\n        markers, and organ and cell culture systems and
animal models. Also of interest are studies on cancer etiology by
environmental chemicals, tobacco\n        consumption and exposure,
nutritional hazards, alcohol, asbestos, silica, and man-made fibers. CEB
 supports studies on endogenous exposure to steroid\n        hormones
and the generation of oxygen radicals during normal metabolism, studies
on phytoestrogens and xenoestrogens and their impact on the metabolism\n
        of endogenous estrogens. In addition, CEB supports the

Cancer Immunology and Hematology. The Cancer Immunology and Hematology
Branch (CIHB) supports a broad spectrum of basic research focused on
the\n        earliest stages of hematopoiesis and tracing the molecular
events that lead to the development of all the functional elements of
the immune system and,\n        when errors occur, to the development of
 leukemias and lymphomas. Most research of interest falls into three
major areas. The first is the immune\n        response to tumors to
include studies of all of the cells (T, B, NK, antigen-presenting, and
other myeloid cells) and secreted molecules (antibodies\n        and
cytokines) of the immune system that can recognize and affect tumor
growth. Emphasis is placed on the alteration in the mechanisms
responsible for\n        the failure of immune response to eradicate
most tumors under normal conditions, and the development of strategies
to circumvent these mechanisms. A\n        second major area of interest
 examines the biology of hematopoietic malignancies to describe the
molecular biology reasons underlying the cell's\n        failure to
respond to normal growth controls and to develop novel approaches to
prevention or therapy. The third distinct area supported is the basic\n
       biology of bone-marrow transplantation, including studies of host
 cell engraftment, graft-versus-host disease, and the basis of the\n
    graft-versus-leukemia effect. Specific research and technologies
supported by CIHB include but are not limited to the following:\n    \n
   \n    \n    \n        1.   Development of improved or novel
monoclonal antibody technologies including improvements of methodologies
 for fusion, production of novel cells as\n        fusion partners,

cancer biomedical imaging.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        7.
Development of systems, methods and their optimization to advance the
role of imaging in assessment of response to therapy through increased\n
        application of quantitative anatomic, functional, and molecular
imaging endpoints in clinical therapeutic trials and dissemination of
these systems and\n        methods with appropriate scientific
communities.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        F.    Radiation Research.
The Radiation Research Program (RRP) supports basic, developmental and
applied research (including clinical) related to\n        cancer
treatment utilizing ionizing and non-ionizing radiations. Therapeutic
modalities include photon therapy, particle therapy, photodynamic
therapy\n        (PDT), hyperthermia, radioimmunotherapy (RIT), systemic
 targeted radionuclide therapy (STaRT), and boron neutron capture
therapy (BNCT). Radiation\n        research encompasses a range of
scientific disciplines including basic biology, chemistry, physics and
clinical radiation oncology. Topics of interest\n        include, but
are not limited to, the following areas:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  1.   Development of devices for planning, measuring, and delivering
radiation therapy or related therapies, including devices for patient
positioning\n        and quality assurance for the following: (a)
ionizing radiation, particularly 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy
(3DCRT) and intensity-modulated\n        radiotherapy (IMRT); (b) PDT;
(c) hyperthermia; (d) RIT; (e) STaRT; and (f) particle therapy.\n    \n
   \n    \n    \n        2.   Development of devices for dosimetry for
(a) ionizing radiation; (b) PDT, particularly those capable of measuring
 light doses at depth in tissues;\n        (c) thermometry for
hyperthermia, particularly non-invasive thermometry; and (d) RIT.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n              Devices may include chemical, solid
state, film, biological or ionization systems to detect or read out
exposures. Accuracy, precision and linear\n        response are
essential over the range of doses and temperatures employed in the
research laboratory and\/or in the clinic, depending on their intended\n
        use. Devices for thermometry during hyperthermia treatment must
give accurate readings with the heating device(s) with which they are to
 be used.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   Development and
evaluation of computer hardware and software for radiation therapy, such
 as computation algorithms, computer workstations, image\n
guidance techniques, and informatics methods for treatment planning,
delivery and outcomes analysis.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        4.
Development of novel drugs to increase the effectiveness of radiation
therapy or related therapies: (a) chemical modifiers of radiation
response,\n        particularly small molecules directed at molecular
targets involved in tumor radioresistance; (b) photosensitizers for PDT;
 (c) sensitizers for use\n        with hyperthermia; and (d) prodrugs
that are selectively activated within the tumor.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        5.   Development of drugs to prevent, reduce or reverse normal
 tissue response, especially the late effects that develop months or
years after therapy.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n              Compounds
that are based on a rationale for achieving a therapeutic gain (an
improved differential response between tumor and normal tissue) are\n
     of greatest interest. Enhancement of response must be achieved at
radiation doses and treatment schedules employed clinically.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        6.   Development of predictive assays and monitors
 of response to radiotherapy, PDT, hyperthermia, STaRT, or RIT. Tools
are needed to identify patients\n        that would benefit from
specific therapeutic approaches.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        G.
Biological Response Modifiers (BRM). Research on agents or approaches
that alter the relationship between tumor and host by modifying the
host's\n        biological response to tumor cells with resultant
therapeutic benefits. Both preclinical and clinical investigations are
conducted on the utility of a\n        wide variety of natural and
synthetic agents and on biological manipulations of immunological and
non-immunological host mediated, tumor-growth\n        controlling
mechanisms in cancer therapy.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
   Studies are encouraged which utilize in vitro assays and\/or animal
model systems to investigate mechanisms of BRMs. Examples of
innovative\n        research include but are not limited to:\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        1.   Evaluation of molecular genetic approaches to
 discovery of new therapeutic agents, delivery of BRMs or development of
 gene therapy.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Development of
improved techniques to synthesize, screen and develop new
oligonucleotides including iRNA sequences for therapeutic purposes,
such\n        as signal modulation, anti-oncogene or anti-viral
effects.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   Improvement in
cell-culturing techniques, e.g., by developing automated cell culture
systems, specialized media, or improved methods to induce\n
activation, proliferation or differentiation.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
       4.   Development of new procedures or reagents for the modulation
 of the suppressor arm of the immune system in experimental models,
directed towards\n        successful immunotherapy.\n    \n    \n    \n
   \n        5.   Improvement of tumor-associated antigens or vaccines
in an attempt to enhance immunogenicity.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

vivo to vaccines.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        7.   Development of
novel in vitro assays for the primary screening of BRMs.\n    \n    \n
  \n    \n        8.   Application of observations describing shared

federal\n        agencies assist the private sector in manufacturing
innovation efforts.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        11. Development of
innovative methods for monitoring the manufacturing process for
biotherapeutics using in-line or on-line process analyzers to\n
improve the efficiency of process controls and determination of

involvement of community physicians and allied health professionals in
cancer control efforts and\n        the promotion of linkages between
community practitioners\/hospitals and other regional resources for
cancer control.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n               Objectives are
to: (1) reduce the time between research advances in prevention,
detection, and patient management and their application in\n
community settings; and (2) expand extend the cancer care knowledge and
applications bases; and (3) evaluate new detection and diagnostic
methods for\n        specificity, sensitivity, reliability, validity,

populations. This may include screening\n        research as well.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        C.    Rehabilitation and Continuing Care.
Development and evaluation of rehabilitation or continuing care
strategies which directly enhance functioning\n        of patients with
cancer or which contribute to understanding of factors impacting
utilization of supportive services by cancer patients. Clinical\n
 applications include development and testing of interventions to
enhance multidisciplinary approaches to cancer rehabilitation, and
research on\n        effective symptom management (e.g., cancer-related
pain, fatigue, nausea, mucositis). Areas of general program interest
include innovative approaches\n        to measuring and enhancing
quality of life of cancer patients; research to investigate and enhance
clinical decision-making by both patients and\n        physicians; and
studies of the impact of individual preferences for health care outcomes
 and their impact on cancer prevention practices in persons\n
without cancer and on treatment decisions in patients with cancer.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        D.    Early Detection and Screening. New
diagnostic or screening methods for early detection of cancer,
especially for asymptomatic patients. Detection\n        methods can
include any cancer site, although there is more interest in the common
cancers, such as those of the lung and colon. Methods should be cost\n
      beneficial and applicable in a clinical setting.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        1.   Studies which identify and document new databases
relevant to early cancer detection and propose using new and
experimental analytical techniques.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.
  Analyses of long-term, follow-up data from completed studies for
potential new interpretations based on the passage of time.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        3.   Studies which propose to develop and evaluate
 new detection techniques and measures for sensitivity specificity,
reliability, validity and safety.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        4.
Determinations of the cost\/benefit or risk\/benefit ratios of cancer
screening and detection methods when applied in defined or target
populations.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.   Currently, the most
commonly used method to detect prostatic cancer is the digital rectal
examination. Various devices and models would be\n        necessary for
the early detection of prostate cancers by physical examination. They
would include, but not limited to the following disease states: (1)\n
     absence of disease (normal model); (2) benign prostatic
hypertrophy; (3) prostatitis; (4) Stage B1 prostatic cancer (T2a); (5)
Stage B2 prostatic\n        cancer (T2b); and (6) Stage C prostatic
cancer (T3z, T3b, and T4).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        6.
Development of products that aid the systematic collection and transport
 of specimens used for the early detection of cancer, including
devices\n        for the collection and transport of urine, serum, fecal
 material, exfoliated cells, and other potential materials.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        7.   Develop computer utility programs that can
increase the clinical uses of existing programs commonly found in
medical offices creating age-sex\n        registries, predicting
population risks, determining screening needs of patients, reminder
systems, etc. Develop bioinformatics to study gene\n        profiling.\n
    \n    \n    \n    \n        8.   Develop personal computer programs
that can be used to determine population risks and the effect of
interventions. These programs might also be\n        adopted to the
concept of Community Oriented Primary Care.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
     9.   Use of ultrasonography with color flow imaging for the early
detection of cancer. Research on the use of ultrasonography with color
flow imaging\n        (US-CFI) for the early detection of cancer of the
ovary, breast and\/or prostate. Emphasis should be given to the ability
of the US-CFI to differentiate\n        between malignant and benign
disease at these sites. Criteria for the discrimination of malignant
from benign disease would be developed as well as\n        performance
characteristics of this method, particularly for breast and prostate.
Studies on symptomatic populations should yield sensitivity,\n
specificity and positive predicative values when breast and prostate are
 the target sites. Studies on asymptomatic populations should yield\n
     sensitivity, specificity and positive predicative values when
ovarian cancer is the target site.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        10.
As more women seek mammographic breast screening, the importance of
efficient, high speed, \u201cintelligent\u201d mammographic systems
capable of acquiring\n        and storing large volumes of images and
enhancing image interpretation will become more important. Technological
 developments of interest are:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        a.
Develop digital mammographic systems for high volume applications with
electronic archiving and image analysis capabilities.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        b.   Develop artificial intelligence based interactive
image analysis software to enhance mammographic sensitivity and
specificity.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        E.    Cancer Biomarkers.
The Cancer Biomarkers Research Group (CBRG) promotes research on the
discovery, development, and validation of biomarkers for\n
pre-cancer and early cancer detection and relevant technologies so that
risk can be more accurately assessed and cancers can be detected at
early\n        stages of development. Early detection has the potential
to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality. In cancer research, biomarkers
 refer to substances\n        that are indicative of the presence of
cancer in the body. Biomarkers include genes, RNAs, proteins, and
metabolites. As the molecular changes that\n        occur during tumor
development can take place over a number of years, biomarkers can be
potentially used to detect cancers early. Topics of interest\n
include, but are not limited to, the following areas:\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        1.   Discovery, development and\/or validation of
biomarkers (genomic, epigenomic, proteomic and metabolomic) for
precancerous lesions, early cancer\n        detection, and
identification of risk.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.
Development of new biological, genetic, histochemical, immunologic, and
molecular assay or analyses applied to early cancer detection, risk\n
     assessment, or susceptibility.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.
  Development of new tools and technologies, including microfluidics and
 nanotechnologies, for analyzing biomarkers for early cancer detection
and\n        risk assessment.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        4.   In
silico data analysis for the discovery and identification of cancer
biomarkers.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.   Ancillary studies to
discover biomarkers from ongoing prevention and treatment trials and any
 large studies.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        6.   Development of
statistical and epidemiological approaches to biomarkers evaluation for
early cancer detection and risk.\n    \n    \n    \n\n",

Increase Wear ",
        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n        In 2008,
the U.S. Coast Guard received reports for 4,789 boating incidents; 3,331
 boaters were reported injured, and 709 died. Among those who drowned,\n
        9 out of 10 were not wearing life jackets (personal floatation
device or PDF). Most boating fatalities that occurred during 2008 (72%)
were caused by\n        drowning with 90% of victims not wearing life
jackets (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Wide-ranging OnLine
 Data for Epidemiologic Research\n        (WONDER) [online]. (2010)
Available from URL: HYPERLINK "http:\/\/wonder.cdc.gov\/mortsql.html"
\\t "_blank"http:\/\/wonder.cdc.gov\/mortsql.html).\n    \n    \n    \n
   \n        For those who take to the water for occupational purposes,
the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) estimates during 1982-1987 the annual
occupational fatality rate\n        for U.S. commercial fishermen was 47
 deaths per 100,000 workers. The major cause of these deaths was
drowning. According to information gathered by\n        CDC\u2019s
Alaska Activity, the occupational fatality rate for commercial fishermen
 in Alaska during 1991-1993 was 195 deaths per 100,000 workers --
nearly\n        30 times the average annual rate for all U.S. workers.
Of these 195 deaths, 91% were caused by drowning. Data clearly show that
 PFDs greatly increase\n        the chances of survival for fishermen:
63% of fishermen wearing PFDs when they jumped or fell into the water
survived, whereas only 12% of those\n        without PFDs survived.
These conclusions and recommendations may apply to all commercial
fishing operations in the United States.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  Public Health Impact:\n        Studies have shown that the majority of
 drowning incidents were precipitated by unexpected entry into the
water, which means the victim had no time to\n        grab a life jacket
 before entering the water. Many of the drowning incidents could have
been prevented by wearing a PDF. Common reasons given for not\n
wearing a life jacket include being 1) uncomfortable and 2) expensive. A
 newly designed life jacket that addressed these issued has the
potential to\n        increase use and decrease morbidity and mortality
from drowning. It is believed that a wide array of retail and commercial
 outlets (specialty outdoor\n        retail stores, warehouse stores,

Childhood Obesity",
        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n        Childhood
obesity affects 23 million children in the United States. Seventy
percent of overweight and obese youth become overweight and obese
adults,\n        which significantly increases the risk of hypertension,
 type 2 diabetes, kidney problems, heart disease, and certain types of
cancer (Power, Lake &amp;amp;\n        Cole, 1997; Dietz, 1998). Most
school-based childhood obesity interventions target some aspect of
energy balance\u2014either reducing the calories consumed\n        by
removing soda machines in schools or providing healthy meal choices, or
by increasing physical activity through recess, physical education
classes,\nafter school, or weekend programs. Although physical education
 and recess time will help address the issue, a process to engage in
physical activity        during the entire duration of the school day
may provide additional benefits (see description of winnable battles,
obesity, at HYPERLINK\n
"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/obesity\/causes\/index.html" \\t
"_blank"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/obesity\/causes\/index.html ). Results
from a pilot study of 71\n        first-graders in five classrooms
showed a 17% increase in calories burned for the treatment group
compared to control group (p = 0.022). Children whose\n        weight
was higher than the 85th percentile for their age group and gender
showed a 32% increase in calories burned (1.56 kcal\/min vs. 1.18
kcal\/min).\n        Research conducted in work settings has used
dynamic environments as well, including a stand\/sit workstation, to
reduce weight and improve\n        productivity, which suggests that
this may translate to children\u2019s school environments with similar
effects.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Public Health Impact:\n
 Standing desks for schools children may provide a relatively low-cost,
low-effort method of combating childhood obesity in an institutional
setting in\n        which most American children spend a great deal of
time. Schools and school districts could be encouraged to purchase
standing desks for their\n        classrooms based on increased calorie
burn, increased academic performance, and improved behavior in the
classroom. For example, after learning of the\n        pilot
study\u2019s success in five classrooms, the Edinburg Consolidated
Independent School District in south Texas decided to purchase standing
desks for\n        four new elementary schools and one new middle school
 in the next few years. As new schools are built and older schools are
renovated, districts may\n        consider standing workstations as
better alternatives to traditional classroom furniture.\n    \n    \n
 \n    \n        Examples of specific research areas of interest
include, but are not limited to:\n        Develop a standing desk
(workstation) for use in elementary school classrooms as a strategy to
change the physical environment to prevent childhood\n        obesity.
Characteristics of an effective desk include usability, comfort,
likeability for students and teachers, and sustained across a variety
of\n        classroom types. Ideally a well designed standing desk would
 increase students\u2019 caloric burn, decrease body fat percentage and
body mass index, and\n        improve academic performance.\n    \n

 Wholesale Products Made Easier",
        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n        The
majority of the U.S. adult population consumes more than 2 times their
recommended maximum of daily sodium. Higher consumption of sodium
strongly\n        increases the risk of having high blood pressure which
 currently affects nearly 1 in 3 adult Americans, the majority of whom
do not have it under\n        control. High blood pressure is a leading
risk factor for heart disease and stroke, the first and third leading
causes of death, as well as kidney\n        disease. The vast majority
of sodium consumed in the United States comes from restaurant and
processed foods. Two scalable strategies to help reduce\n        the
amount of sodium in the American diet include: 1) reducing the amount of
 sodium in restaurant and processed foods and 2) informing the public
about\n        recommended sodium intake levels, the sodium content of
the foods they purchase.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Currently for
wholesale purchasers, there are no readily accessible non proprietary
(or non commercial) datasets that provide nutritional value or food\n
     quality information, such as sodium, sugar or fat content of
wholesale food products. High volume food purchasers need such tools to
make seeking out\n        and purchasing healthier food products easy
and convenient.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Public Health Impact:\n
        Improving nutrition by reducing sodium intake is one of
CDC\u2019s Winnable Battles and one that will save lives. Recent
research has advised that reducing\n        sodium levels in packaged
foods and restaurant foods in half would save tens of thousands of lives
 per year from fatal heart attacks and strokes.\n        Reducing
average population intake to the recommended 2300 mg per day may reduce
cases of hypertension by 11 million and save $18 billion health care\n
      dollars.\u00a0\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        The nutritional
datasets have the potential to be marketed to restaurateurs as well as
to large food service providers in government, education, and\n
business as a commercial product. There are over 500,000 private
industry food and drink establishments in the US that could benefit from
 this tool.\n        High volume food purchasers are key points of
leverage in changing the nation\u2019s food supply. By shifting
purchases to healthier products, these\n        businesses would not
only provide healthier foods to their constituents, but send a powerful
message to wholesalers that consumers demand healthier\n
products.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Examples of specific research
 areas of interest include, but are not limited to:\n        Develop an
accessible nutritional information system for low sodium products to be
used by restaurants and wholesale food purchasers. The system should\n
      include geocoding and a search tool. Elements of developing the
nutritional information system may included identifying the structure
and key variables\n        in the food supply chain in the US,
cataloguing the nutrient content of products available from suppliers,
development of a web-based search tool to\n        enable purchasers to
search for vendors servicing their geographic area that provide lower
sodium food products. Future use could be expanded to\n        include

Sharps Injuries",
        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n
The\u00a0needle-syringe\u00a0(N-S), invented 150 years ago, while
invaluable in medicine, also pose several risks, primarily through
intentional or inadvertent\n        unsterile re-use, as well as through
 needlestick injury and improper waste disposal. These pose a
substantial burden in resulting transmission of\n        blood-borne
pathogens (BBPs) in healthcare workers, patients and others exposed to
these sharps.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        The World Health
Organization estimates that unsafe injections result in 260,000 human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 21 million hepatitis B virus\n
(HBV), and 2 million hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and 9.2 million
Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost annually.\u00a0\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        Fundamentally, the N-S is
\u201cover-engineered\u201d for its routine use. For a medical procedure
 that is low pressure and takes a few seconds, one is left with\n
 an almost indestructible stainless steel needle and a durable plastic
syringe. In some developed countries, the solution\u00a0has been to use
sterile,\n        disposable\u00a0N-Ss only once, activate their
needletip-shielding devices, and then\u00a0discard each in a safety
container (and ultimately incinerated). Such\n        safety syringes
are uncommon among diabetics and intravenous drug users (IDUs), however;
 therefore safe disposal of used N-S in these two populations\n
remain an issue.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        In developing
countries, N-S with safety features is usually unavailable due to their
higher cost. Logistical constraints result in interruptions in\n
the supply of new\u00a0N-Ss to remote clinics, and make more difficult
maintaining proper sharps waste disposal systems. Supply interruptions
and limited\n        funds encourage improper recycling\u00a0of what
should be single-use-only N-S. Auto-disabling syringes used in some
settings in developing countries (e.g.,\n        immunizations) do not
yet have needle-shielding features, and are not yet universally
available and used to prevent improper re-use. These problems\n
extend to almost all other sharps needed to provide modern health
care.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Public Health Impact:\n
\u00a0 Reduction in the number of unsafe injections and sharps injuries
will help prevent the spread of HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.\n

for Systemic HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis",
        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n        The
HIV\/AIDS pandemic remains among our greatest public health challenges.
More than a quarter century after the description of the first cases
of\n        AIDS, HIV has spread to virtually every country in the world
 infecting 65 million people and killing 25 million. The ongoing high
incidence of HIV\n        infection and the incomplete coverage with
basic HIV prevention tools underscore the need for new, highly effective
 biomedical HIV interventions to\n        complement existing prevention
 strategies. In the absence of a vaccine, the administration of
antiretroviral (ARVs) drugs before HIV exposure\n        (pre-exposure
prophylaxis or PrEP) has gained considerable attention as a strategy to
protect high-risk HIV-negative people from becoming infected.\n
PrEP is a proven concept for other infectious diseases such as malaria,
and multiple lines of evidence suggest that it might also be a
feasible\n        strategy to prevent HIV infection. ARVs drugs
effectively prevent HIV transmission at birth, during breastfeeding, and
 after occupational exposure, and\n        as topical gels can prevent
vaginal transmission. Several clinical trials with daily oral PrEP are
now ongoing in high-risk populations. A reasonable\n        next step
would be to evaluate more practical, less costly drug delivery systems
for humans.\u00a0\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Public Health
Impact:\n        Mathematical models estimate that over the next 10
years an effective PrEP program with daily ARVs could prevent 2.7 to 3.2
 million of the 11 million\n        new HIV-1 infections projected to
occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Model simulations have also shown that an
effective PrEP program could substantially\n        reduce the incidence
 of HIV transmission in populations at high risk of infection in the
United States. This potentially significant public health\n
benefit of PrEP requires a very high efficacy of the drugs and a high
degree of adherence to the PrEP regimen. However, prophylactically
giving people\n        daily ARVs drugs may be costly and impractical,
even if confined to a high-risk population. Thus, special emphasis
should be made on evaluating\n        long-acting drug delivery systems
including injectable biopolymers that entrap and slowly release ARVs
systemically over prolonged (weeks-months)\n        periods of time. If
effective, these systems could substantially decrease the frequency of
ARV dosing, improve adherence, and minimize costs. PrEP with\n
long-acting drug formulations may also provide an attractive prevention
strategy against postnatal HIV acquisition in breast-fed babies.\u00a0\n
    \n    \n    \n    \n        Examples of specific research areas of
interest include, but are not limited to:\n        \u00a0 The
development of novel long-acting drug delivery systems for systemic PrEP
 including injectable bio polimers that entrap and slowly release
ARVs.\n        Designs should include systems for controlled release of
attractive drug candidates for PrEP including HIV reverse transcriptase,
 entry, and integrase\n        inhibitors. Initial studies may
incorporate drug pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies in non-human
primates. Experimental design may include ways to\n        measure drug
levels in blood and tissues and explore correlates of protection.
Studies should be designed with the long-term goal of providing\n
 information that will guide human clinical trials.\n    \n",

Down",
        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n        Traffic
crashes account for half of all unintentional injury deaths, are the
leading cause of death for people ages 5\u201334 in the United States,
and\n        result in nearly 5 million serious injuries. In one-year,
the cost of medical care and productivity losses associated with traffic
 injuries in the\n        United States exceeded $99 billion. Globally,
road traffic injuries kill 3,000 persons daily.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        The risk of motor vehicle crashes is highest among teen
drivers age 16- to 19-year-olds. Alcohol is a contributing factor in 37%
 of fatal motor vehicle\n        crashes. In 63%HYPERLINK
"http:\/\/www.car-accidents.com\/pages\/fatal-accident-statistics.html"
of fatal crashes, the occupant killed was not wearing a\n        seat
belt. Excessive speed has been identified as a key risk factor in
traffic injuries, influencing both the risk of a crash and the severity
of the\n        injuries that result.\u00a0\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
     Motor vehicle crashes result from a combination of environmental,
human behavioral, and vehicle-related factors. Modifying any or all can
substantially\n        alter the risks of a crash, and the chances of
survival. The ecological approach that modifying any one factor can
influence all others, and that\n        feedback loops about the
performance of the vehicle, road and environment, and driver fitness
will reduce risks and errors, but this requires adaptive\n
technology. Currently, there are no readily accessible means to warn the
 driver of impending dangers such as perceptual deficits, driver
error,\n        hazardous road conditions and environments, and
suboptimal vehicle performance that may influence crash risks. Nor are
there convenient accessible\n        databases to find affordable
alternative transportation options. Drivers need such tools to make
life-saving decisions easier and more automatic.\u00a0\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        Public Health Impact:\n        \u00a0 Improving safe and
 efficient travel is a universal goal. Reducing traffic crashes and the
injuries that result is a primary goal in public health and\n        one
 of CDC\u2019s Winnable Battles. Reducing speeding, increasing safety
belt use, reducing traffic exposure, and eliminating alcohol-impaired\n
       driving, fatigue and driver distraction as factors in traffic
crashes could save tens of thousands of lives annually and reduce
disabling injuries by\n        more than half, in addition to saving
billions in health care costs.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Examples
 of specific research areas of interest include, but are not limited
to:\n        CDC is particularly interested in the development of
improved environmental, engineering, and human factor controls
(including retrofit vehicle\n        solutions and information
technology to access to alternative forms of transportation) with the
potential to reduce motor vehicle crashes and the\n        injuries that
 result. Development of real-time technologies that deliver to
interventions, such as \u201ccues to safe action\u201d, while driving,
based on\n        driver fitness, vehicle performance characteristics,
environmental conditions, and road -based information. Technology that
can be applied in both\n        occupational driving and private vehicle
 use in domestic and global settings is of high interest, along with
applications of this technology to assist\n        persons with
cognitive or psychomotor limitations (e.g. distracted, drowsy, alcohol
impaired or drug impaired driving).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        For

completion of the HGP in 2003 set the stage for making use of the
immense potential inherent in knowledge of the complete DNA sequence\nof
 the human genome to be applied for the improvement of human health and
well-being. In an effort to outline a path forward, the Vision Document (

need to\n        be addressed: (1) elucidating the structure and
function of genomes; (2) translating genome-based knowledge into health
benefits; and (3) promoting the\n        use of genomics to maximize
benefits and minimize harms. The latter area relates closely to

\n    \n        2.  Technologies for Generating Precise Measurements of
Internal Dose of Environmental Agents\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
The NIEHS is interested in developing technologies and devices to
generate precise measurements of internal dose of individual
environmental agents and\n        or their metabolites in real time and
over time. It would be especially valuable to analyze internal dose over
 time of multiple agents within a single\n        class or multiple
agents across more than one class. The development of a modular design
allowing measurement of specific classes of chemical exposures\n
for application in epidemiological studies (e.g., pesticides,
endocrine-active chemicals, or components of indoor air pollution) is
preferred.\n        Likewise, an emphasis is placed on measuring
environmental factors with mixed routes of exposure (i.e., inhalation,
ingestion, and dermal exposure) for\n        which biomonitoring is the
only comprehensive exposure metric.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
Examples include but are not limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  A.    Development of sensors for measuring the levels of toxicants in
biospecimens easily attained for an individual such as finger prick,

  \n    \n    \n        Improved Test Systems for Prioritization and
Safety Evaluation\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        The NIEHS is
interested in: (1) developing, standardizing, and validating sensitive
and specific innovative tests and integrated testing strategies\n
 that can reduce, refine, or replace animal use and that will provide
improved predictivity, and potential cost and time savings compared to
current\n        standard laboratory animal tests ( i.e., assays for
carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity, reproductive or developmental toxicity,
 dermal toxicity, and neuro\n        or other organ system toxicity
including acute local and systemic toxicity); and (2) developing mid-
and high-throughput screens and tests using\n        phylogenetically
lower animal species (e.g., fish, worms) to evaluate mechanisms of
toxicity to identify mechanisms of chemically-induced biological\n
  activity, prioritize chemicals for more extensive toxicological
evaluation, and develop more predictive models of in vivo biological\n
      response. The proposed tests and strategies should use
computational and\/or biochemical models, cell\/ tissue cultures,
and\/or animal models that are\n        relevant to existing safety
assessment databases and human experience, and that can be extrapolated
to estimate risks to humans. The endpoints for\n        these tests or
assays should take advantage of the new technologies such as genomics,
transcriptomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics and of novel\n
endpoints (biomarkers) including those that are non-invasive. Examples
include but are not limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        A.

biokinetic modeling to predict acute and chronic systemic toxicity.\n
 \n    \n    \n    \n        B.    In vitro test methods and integrated
strategies (e.g., undifferentiated\/ differentiated human\/mammalian
cell model systems, organotypic model\n        systems, biochemical
activity (e.g., peptide binding; and computational models) that can be
used to prioritize compounds for more extensive testing\n        and\/or
 to predict acute and chronic toxicity by taking into account, for
example, metabolism, the ability of chemicals to pass through barriers
(i.e.,\n        blood brain, kidney, lung, gastrointestinal), and organ
specific effects, or which allow the development of endpoints that can
be extrapolated to in\n        vivo biomarkers of toxicity. An emphasis
is placed on the development of engineered 3D tissue systems that
include multiple cell types and that\n        replicate the anatomy and
function of intact tissue. Of particular interest are systems that
replicate key functions of major organs (e.g., skin,\n        kidney,

immunological function in these models.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

        "topic_name": "Division of Neuroscience and Basic Behavioral
Science",
        "description": "\n    \n    \n    \n        Through research in
neuroscience and basic behavioral science we can gain an understanding
of the fundamental mechanisms underlying thought, emotion,\n        and
behavior and an understanding of what goes wrong in the brain in mental
illness. Research sponsored by the Division of Neuroscience and Basic\n
       Behavioral Science covers a broad range of neuroscience topics:
from both experimental and theoretical approaches, from molecules to
whole brains to\n        populations of individuals, from single cell
organisms to humans, from across the entire lifespan, and from states of
 health and disease. This division\n        also supports research on
the basic behavioral, psychological, and social processes that underlie
normal behavioral functioning. The topics listed\n        below reflect
the NIMH interest in technologies related to this broad range, but
should not be considered a complete list. Prospective applicants are\n
      strongly encouraged to contact Dr. Margaret Grabb (listed below)
with questions about the relevance of their interests to the mission of
this division.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        A.    Cutting-Edge
Technologies for Neuroscience Research. Most of the research topics
listed after this one are posed from the Division's neuroscience\n
  and basic behavioral science mission-oriented perspective, however,
the technologies that might be developed to address those mission goals
might be\n        quite fundamental. Prospective applicants familiar
with such technologies, but not familiar with the mission-related use of
 these technologies, are\n        strongly encouraged to contact Dr.
Margaret Grabb (listed below) for assistance in bridging this gap
between their technical knowledge and knowledge of\n        the
neuroscience-related mission of NIMH. Technologies and approaches that
might be used in products relevant to this mission include, but are
not\n        limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Caged
Molecules. These chemical entities could be activated, or could release
an active agent, when specified bonds are broken by\n        chemical,
biochemical, photic, or other means. Among other uses, such molecules
could be used to indicate biochemical or physiological processes or to\n
        deliver pharmacologic substances to highly localized brain
regions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Genetically Engineered
Proteins. Such proteins could be put to any number of uses, including to
 express a fluorophore or chromophore at\n        the occurrence of
specific biochemical processes to report the time and location of such
processes in brain tissue.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.
Inducible Gene Expression. Methods to turn on or off expression of
particular genes in animals on the basis of time in the lifespan,\n
   location in the brain, or other factors. Such a capability would
significantly advance basic brain research, and would have important
implications for\n        treatment and therapy of mental illness.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        4.   Combinatorial Approaches. These are
high-through-put approaches that can be used to screen and synthesize
molecules that affect brain\n        cells.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
     5.   Biocompatible Biomaterials. Such research and development
relates to the chronic use of electrodes and other probes used in
brain\n        research, as well as implanted drug delivery devices.\n
  \n    \n    \n    \n        6.   Nanotechnologies. This emerging area
of technology presents a wide range of opportunities for brain research,
 from the fabrication of\n        probes to monitor brain physiology to
novel means of delivering drugs and other substances.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        7.   Informatics Tools. Such technologies allow brain
scientists, clinicians and theorists to make better sense and use of
their data. These\n        tools and approaches include those to
acquire, store, visualize, analyze, integrate, synthesize and share
data, including those for electronic\n        collaboration.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        8.   Simulation Technologies. Computer-based,
biologically realistic simulations of parts of neurons, neurons, and
circuits.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        9.   Mathematical,
Statistical and Computer Algorithms. Such algorithms could be used to
analyze large and\/or complex data sets. Examples of\n        these data
 sets include those derived from multiple, single-unit recording studies
 and functional imaging studies. Among other applications, these\n
  could be used to segment images (obtained from electron or light
microscopes, or from volumetric imaging instruments such as confocal
microscopes and\n        magnetic resonance imagers), filter noise,
visualize data or search vast data sets for specified patterns or data
(e.g., use of pattern recognition\n        algorithms to search time
series data sets obtained from electrophysiological recording of neural
activity, or video data obtained from behavioral\n        analysis of
genetically altered animals). In addition, digital reconstruction of
dendritic and axonal arbors would be of interest.\n    \n    \n    \n
 \n        10. Telemetry. Transferring data from one point to another is
 important for neuroscientists monitoring the physiological signals from
 the\n        brain. Telemetry, even over relatively short distances
(from a few millimeters to a few meters), could, for example, provide a
means to obtain data\n        from awake, behaving animals without
interfering with the behavior of interest. Examples include telemetry
that can be easily implanted\/attached to\n        awake behaving
animals for measuring peripheral\/autonomic responses (this approach
could be used to inform stress\/emotion research), miniaturized\n
 telemetry for use in smaller animals with increased numbers of
recording devices\/electrodes implanted per animal. Alternatives to
telemetry would be\n        considered as well.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        11. Biosensors. Neurons communicate with each other through
thousands of different chemical substances; internally, molecular
pathways direct\n        the function of the neuron. Sensors of high
specificity and sensitivity for such substances would provide
neuroscientists with important new ways to\n        study the brain.\n
  \n    \n    \n    \n        B.    Instrumentation for Basic
Neuroscience Research. Modern equipment that uses the most recent
technological advances is needed in neuroscience\n        research so
that neural substrates of mental illness can be identified and
localized. The NIMH is interested in supporting research and development
 of\n        new or improved approaches relevant to, but not limited to,
 the following:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Neurophysiology.
Microelectrodes for stimulation and\/or recording, smart nanoscaffolds,
macroelectrodes, biocompatible coatings,\n        interfaces to
electronics, software for data analysis, visualization, etc. Systems
with better\/easier MR compatibility would also be of interest.\n    \n
   \n    \n    \n        2.   Cell Sorting. Based on cell size, type,
function, morphology, abnormal features, specific membrane proteins,
etc.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   In Vivo Electrochemical
Voltammetry. More sensitive and selective electrodes, software for data
analysis, etc.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        4.   High Performance
Liquid Chromatography. Improved reliability, specificity, sensitivity,
etc.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.   Technology to support
Multiple Unit Recording Electrode Arrays. Recording techniques, analysis
 techniques and raw data storage.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        6.
Physiological and Behavioral Monitoring. Temperature, activity, sleep
duration, neuronal activity, EEG activity, EKG, pulse rate,\n
recording, capture and analysis of multiple single unit activity from
microelectrodes, automated SWS analysis and coherence of EEG rhythms,
and further\n        refinement of High density EEGs.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        7.   Development of novel technologies for stimulating
specific cells or signaling pathways in awake behaving animals.\n    \n
   \n    \n    \n        8.   Development of more sensitive fluorescent
probes for simultaneous and real time measures of multiple
neurotransmitter release and intracellular\n        signaling pathway
activities.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        9.   Associated Software.\n
    \n    \n    \n    \n        C.    Macroscopic Neuroimaging. Modern
technologies allow for the observation of the structure and function of
the intact brain. This capability has\n        the potential to greatly
advance understanding of the brain in both health and disease, and
across the lifespan. NIMH is interested in advancing this\n        area
of technology through enhancing current tools and approaches, as well as
 developing entirely new ways to image the brain. All modalities are
of\n        interest, including, but not limited to: magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) or spectroscopy, positron emission tomography (PET),
optical imaging or\n        spectroscopy, single photon emission
computed tomography, magnetoencephalography (MEG), diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI), etc. While not an imaging\n        technique itself,
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an associated, important
technology. TMS can be used in combination with fMRI as means to\n
  further assess physiology and integrity of neural systems both in
health and in mental disorders. Due to its greatly increased use in
recent years,\n        technologies specifically focused on improving
the utility and specificity of fMRI techniques are of particular
interest.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Innovative agents
and\/or technologies to visualize brain connectivity, activity, and
neural plasticity in situ with minimal invasion.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        2.   Improvement in the techniques, the design and
construction of devices for non-invasive imaging for any modality, for
example, improving spatial\n        resolution, quantitative accuracy,
signal-to-noise ratio, and electronics.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
 3.   Development and enhancement of non-invasive imaging techniques for
 evaluating alterations in brain physiology produced by drugs. These
would\n        include techniques for monitoring changes in regional
blood flow; concentrations of drug and\/or tissue metabolites; and the
distribution and activity\n        of receptors.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        4.   Synthesis, or isolation from natural products, of highly
selective receptor ligands or indicators of neurochemical processes,
which would be\n        labeled for imaging by one or more particular
modality.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.   Development of selective
 hormone receptor ligands for brain imaging.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
      6.   Development of imaging agents to examine the integrity of the
 blood brain barrier following infection and other environmental
challenges.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        7.   New approaches in
radiochemistry that will permit more exact identification of the
chemical changes associated with behavioral states (e.g., sleep\n
 or arousal) or mental illness as observed with any particular
neuroimaging modality.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        8.   Synthesis
of molecules containing stable, rarely occurring isotopes designed to be
 detected by non-invasive imaging techniques (e.g.,\n
fluorine-containing molecules, carbon-13 labeled substrates).\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n        9.   Methods and associated products for
quantification of imaging data including new statistical approaches for
evaluating the data.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        10. Methods to
integrate routines for greater and more precise computer enhancement of
the images, and for combining or overlaying images obtained from\n
  multiple modalities.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        11. Software
needed for the precise quantification of data obtained from these
imaging techniques with emphasis on the reliable definition of
discrete,\n        anatomically distinct areas within the brain.\n    \n
    \n    \n    \n        12. Novel agents or other tools to increase
the ability to correlate features of MR images with histological
features (e.g., cytoarchitecture or\n        chemoarchitecture) both
identified and those yet to be identified.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
    13. Generation of physiologic measurements from images of regional
radioactivity generated during PET, especially for the study of brain\n
       neurotransmitter\/neuroreceptor systems.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        14. Novel approaches to visualizing data obtained in
neuroimaging, such as the computational \u201cunfolding\u201d of
three-dimensional images of cerebral\n        cortex.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        15. Improved methods for pediatric brain imaging. These
would include: software and database products, equipment for creating a
\u201cchild-friendly\u201d\n        environment and for the behavioral

   16. Combining of different imaging technologies (e.g., ERPs and fMRI;
 MEG and fMRI; MEG and EEG, optogenetic methods and fMRI, etc.). The
latter\n        example, optfMRI, can be used as means of improving

produce connectivity a map\n        of neural cells that can be defined
both genetically and topographically with a combination of these two

    \n    \n        20. Improvements in TMS techniques that will allow
for greater specificity in the sites of stimulation and greater control
over the effects of the\n        stimulation. In particular,
improvements in stimulators that would allow much smaller effective
fields of stimulation with more reliable and repeatable\n
stimulator placement would be a significant benefit to the field.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        21. Real time fMRI is becoming a research
tool of interest with potential clinical\/therapeutic neurofeedback
applications. Products are needed that\n        would enhance the

The morphology of individual neurons and the distribution of subcellular
 components within them, are key to\n        understanding the manner in
 which these cells function. Advances in the development of agents
indicating neuronal structure and function that can be\n
visualized microscopically are important to the NIMH's interest in brain
 research. This includes enhancements of current agents and ligands to
be\n        imaged (agents indicating specific biochemical processes or
structures, etc.); development of novel agents and ligands; software to
assist interaction\n        with the data; and other related
technologies and methods. Examples would include, but not be limited
to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Software and hardware for
analyzing image data obtained by microscopes, including tools to

\n    \n        8.   Develop cell culture models for neurons, including
methods of purifying homogeneous populations of non-transformed cells
by, for example,\n        developing markers to identify neuronal cell
types for use in characterizing cell-type-specific signaling pathways
which may be useful in tracking the\n        effects of various drugs.\n

affinities for\n        CNS targets.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
13. New approaches to study the multiple functions of particular
proteins.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        14. Tools to study

        15. Technologies to study functional entities within cells

tools and approaches to study protein-protein interactions, especially
those with phosphoproteins. Further develop methods and\n

NIMH\n        include proteins involved in normal function and pathology

(combining optical and genetic techniques to probe neural circuits
within intact animals).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        F.    Genetic
and Transgenic Technology. Advances in genetic and transgenic
technologies offer many opportunities to probe fundamental questions
about\n        the brain, behavior and pathology. NIMH is broadly
interested in these areas; some examples of topics relevant to the
mission of this Institute\n        include, but are not limited to:\n

neuroimaging agents.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        H.
Pharmacology. Pharmacological intervention represents a major force in
the treatment of mental illness, and NIMH is interested in supporting\n
       research and development in this area. However, pharmacologic
agents that primarily act on molecular targets which replicate those
of\n        currently-marketed pharmaceuticals used in the treatment of
mental disorders would not be of interest for this program. Relevant
pharmacology topics\n        include, but are not limited to:\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n        1.   New chemical entities with high, selective
affinities for CNS targets. Examples include, but are not limited to,
receptors, transporters, ion\n        channels, enzymes, kinases, or
second or third messenger systems.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.

therapeutic\n        usefulness using \u201cin vitro\u201d and \u201cin
vivo\u201d assays and model systems.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.
   Methods for extraction, fractionalization, and isolation of active
compounds from natural products. Water-soluble compounds are of
particular\n        interest due to the difficulty of the procedures.\n
   \n    \n    \n    \n        4.   Computer algorithms that model
receptors to evaluate theoretical permutations of known molecules to
find the molecule with the maximum probability\n        of having the
highest affinity for a specific receptor as well as those that have the
potential for the most desirable \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d
rates.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.   Computer models of the
blood brain barrier and evaluate potential and actual drug molecules for
 their ability to cross or penetrate this barrier.\n    \n    \n    \n
  \n        6.   Strategies for evaluating pharmacological agents (e.g.,
 animal behavioral testing, computer simulation) within specific domains
 of cognitive\n        function.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        7.

 therapeutic drugs.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        12. Methods for
evaluation of long-term effects of psychotropic drug administration in
animal models or human subjects. If clinical populations are\n
being tested, the technology would be appropriate for either the
Division of Developmental Translational Research (DDTR) or the Division
of Adult\n        Translation Research (DATR) at NIMH.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        13. Improving existing, and developing new, vectors for
delivery of genes to the brain.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        14.

  \n    \n    \n        15. Development of novel high throughput
screening (HTS) assays for drug development. Examples include, but are
not limited to, in vitro functional\n        assays, toxicology screens,

novel molecular targets for drug development to treat mental
illnesses.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        I.     Tract Tracing Methods
 and Tools. Little is known about the details of the connectivity of the
 human nervous system, because the best tract\n        tracing
techniques are invasive and require the deposit of substances in vivo.
Methods that would be applicable to post-mortem tissue would allow\n
    significant progress in connectional studies of human tissue, as
well as non-human tissue, particularly with regard to the development of
 c, quantu\n        onnections and the connections of structures not
easily accessed in vivo. Examples include the development of improved
physical, chemical and\/or\n        biological markers for
neuroanatomical tract-tracing (e.g. m dots, caged molecules, viral
delivery agents, etc.).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        J.
Educational Tools. Neuroscience, basic behavioral science and human
genetics are compelling areas of science that not only touch upon a\n
     diverse array of disciplines, but also provide insights to the
essence of what it is to be human. Products aimed at teaching the
substance of these\n        fields to students of all ages would be
useful in disseminating this information and these insights. Examples
include, but are not limited to: software\n        and other interactive
 media used to convey fundamental concepts about the brain to children;
computer simulations of neuroscience experiments;\n        updateable
media that presents state-of-the-art information on particular topics
for use by experts; website or other online, interactive electronic\n
     vehicle to allow for sharing of information about the brain and its
 functions, including technologies for holding interactive research
conferences\n        related to basic behavioral sciences, basic
neuroscience, or clinical neuroscience.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
 K.    Neuroinformatics. Data generated by brain research are diverse,
vast, and complex. The diversity of data is due to the fact that
neuroscience\n        data are obtained from: theoretical, experimental
and clinical approaches; from levels of biological organization that
span molecules to populations of\n        individuals and from
single-cell organisms to humans; and from states of health, disease, and
 models of disease. The quantity of data in brain research\n        is
the result of tens of thousands of neuroscience laboratories working
around the world. The complexity of data reflects the high level of\n
     interconnectedness of the data, and their high dimensionality.
Neuroinformatics is a new area of science that draws upon neuroscience,
information\n        science, computer science, statistics, applied
mathematics, and a variety of engineering fields to develop tools that
will let neuroscientists make\n        better sense and use of their
data. These tools include software and hardware for digital data
acquisition, visualization, analysis, integration, and\n        sharing
(e.g., through tools for electronic scientific collaboration). Such
tools can address data of any type or from any area of neuroscience;\n
      examples include, but are not limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        1.   Databases, querying approaches, and information retrieval
 tools for neuroscience and neuroscience-related data. An example would
be the\n        development of a web-based database for sharing,
analyzing and comparing the pharmacological responses of a variety of
CNS active compounds in\n        preclinical studies relevant to mental
health.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Tools for neuroscience
data visualization (and other forms of presentation) and manipulation
(probabilistic atlases of brain structure or\n        function, new
statistical approaches for analyzing data, etc.).\n    \n    \n    \n
 \n        3.   Software for integration and synthesis of neuroscience
data (computational models of neurons to integrate data about structure
and function,\n        environments to merge data from multiple imaging
modalities, etc.).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        4.   Tools for
electronic collaboration to allow neuroscientists to interact with
colleagues, data, and instruments at a distance (this could include\n
     novel types of \u201cgroupware\u201d, etc.).\n    \n    \n    \n
 \n        5.   Tools that bridge existing neuroscience and biology
information tools and resources, such as databases and informatics tools
 associated with\n        genome mapping efforts.\n    \n    \n    \n

technologies\n        related to this research area, but should not be
considered a complete list. Prospective applicants are strongly
encouraged to contact Dr. Margaret\n        Grabb (listed below) with
questions about the relevance of their interests to the mission of this
division.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        A.    Technologies for
Clinical Pediatric Research. It is important to develop reliable methods
 that can correctly identify the normal and abnormal\n        components
 of cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial behavior, as well as normal
and abnormal physiological and biochemical functions, in human\n
development. Computer-based methods of accomplishing this are also
needed to increase the accessibility and reliability of information made
 available\n        to the research community. Examples include:\n    \n
    \n    \n    \n1.          Measurements of Alterations in Pediatric
Development in Patients with Mental Health Disorders Using Physiological
 and Behavioral Measures. \n        Research studies indicate that some
mental health disorders, such as autism, may begin to develop as early
as infancy. Therefore non-invasive modern\n        equipment that use
the most recent technological advances are needed to isolate specific
physiological and behavioral changes during development, to\n
identify potential diagnostic markers of mental health disorders. A
priority for this program is to support research and development of
hardware and\n        software tools to measure pediatric development.
Examples of technologies needed include:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  a.   Psychophysiological measures to evaluate infants, children or
adolescents.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        b.   Miniaturized
non-invasive instruments to record psychophysiological data (e.g., heart
 and respiration rate, galvanic skin response, and defensive\n
motor behavior).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        c.   Telemetry
capability for non-invasive devices so that children can be monitored
for prolonged periods without interfering with their behavior.\n    \n
  \n    \n    \n        d.   Computer programs and inexpensive computers
 that will collect, analyze and identify recurring patterns in the
psychophysiological measure(s) of\n        interest.\n    \n    \n    \n
    \n        2.   Pediatric Assessment Tool.  Diagnosis of mental
health disorders in children and adolescents is vital to providing
early\n        interventions to treat the disorder. In addition, a
better understanding of the concept of functioning in psychopathology,
and its appropriate\n        measurement, is needed in pediatric
populations. In the future, diagnostic tools may even help detect the
initial onset of illness in children at risk,\n        before symptoms
occur. A priority for this program is to develop novel diagnostic tools
to detect mental health disorders in children and adolescents.\n
Of particular interest to this division are methods that can be used
with children and adolescents with limited verbal communication (i.e.,
very young\n        or developmentally disabled). Biochemical, genetic,
physiological and psychological tool development is welcomed.\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n        a.   Technologies to assess CNS effects of
psychosocial or pharmacological interventions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
        b.   Development of reliable and stable
biomarkers\/biosignatures that can identify at-risk individuals prior to
 disease onset, biological and\n        behavioral indicators or
predictors of treatment response, measures of disease progression,
measures to identify dose ranges prior to clinical studies,\n
preclinical or clinical efficacy testing, toxicity measures for drug
development, defining patients to enroll in the clinical study,
identifying CNS\n        abnormalities, etc.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
      c.   Assessment tools for pediatric mental health disorders that
are sensitive to developmental change, gender and cultural diversity,
variation in\n        cognitive and behavioral functioning, hearing
and\/or speech impairment, and co-morbid disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n
   \n        d.   Innovative approaches to assessing mental disorders
using new statistical and psychometric techniques such as Item Response
Theory.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        e.   Computerized methodologies
 for assessing various mental disorders suitable for use in primary care
 settings, e.g. they would need to function\n        rapidly and
reliably.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        f.    Biological and
behavioral measures to define and assess specific impairment-related
components of psychiatric disorders, e.g., cognitive\n
dysfunctions in schizophrenia.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        g.
Development of valid and reliable measures that operationalize
functioning within and across developmental periods, and that can be
used in a\n        variety of service settings. Such measures can lead
to more accurate diagnoses, a better understanding of the impact of
psychiatric disorders, and\n        better tracking of treatment
effectiveness.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   Behavior Monitoring
 and Analysis of Pediatric Mental Health Disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n
   \n        a.   Improve or create new video devices to monitor human
behavior and ease analysis of behavior.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
 b.   Computer software to ease analysis of behavior monitored by video
or telemetry systems.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        c.   Automated
methods to detect specific emotional states using behavioral and
autonomic indicators: This Division is specifically interested in\n
   technologies that can identify children with heightened or dampened
emotional states that could be associated with particular mental health
disorders,\n        including children with limited verbal skills (i.e.,
 very young or developmentally disabled). If the technology will
primarily be used to investigate\n        basic mechanisms of behavior,
the Division of Neuroscience and Basic Behavioral Science at NIMH would
be the most appropriate division to contact.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
      4.   Intervention Development for Childhood-Onset Mental
Disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        a.   Strategies (e.g.,
animal behavioral testing, computer simulation) for evaluating, in early
 developmental periods, the effects of pharmacological\n        agents
on specific functional domains and brain circuits associated with mental
 disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        b.   Strategies (e.g.,
animal behavioral testing, computer simulation) for evaluating, in early
 developmental periods, the effects of cognitive or\n        behavioral
interventions (e.g., cognitive rehabilitation, attention training) or
device-based protocols (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation or\n
    direct current stimulation) on specific functional domains and brain
 circuits associated with mental disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
     c.   Methods for evaluation of long-term effects of
psychotherapeutic drug administration or brain stimulation protocols in
developmental animal\n        models.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
5.   Methodological Research and Development. There is a need to devise
new ways of data collection, analysis, management and dissemination.\n
      Examples include:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        a.
Technologies that use the most recent technological advances to identify
 aberrations in the CNS during development, associated with mental\n
    disorders. Once these aberrations are identified and localized,
rational therapies can be developed and evaluated.\n    \n    \n    \n
  \n        b.   Innovative, computer-based methods to monitor
preventive and treatment intervention efforts and correlate them with
outcome measures are needed.\n        Results should be accessible to
other interested parties without compromising the privacy of the
individual.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        c.   Development of
innovative software for addressing the integration of distributed
cross-disciplinary data sources into coherent knowledge bases.\n
The data should focus on pediatric mental health disorders.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        d.   Computer-based intervention development for
parents or for school settings.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        e.
Development of databases containing detailed genetic and behavioral
information on pediatric populations and their families, as resources
for the\n        field in investigations of gene x environment
interactions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        f.    Mathematical,
statistical and computer algorithms that could be used to analyze large
and\/or complex data sets. Examples of these data sets\n        include
those derived from functional imaging studies. Among other applications,
 these could be used to segment images such as those obtained from\n
    magnetic resonance imagers, filter noise, visualize data or search
vast data sets for specified patterns or data (e.g., use of pattern
recognition\n        algorithms to search time series data sets obtained
 from electrophysiological recording of neural activity, or video data
obtained from behavioral\n        analysis of genetically altered
animals). Improved techniques for path analysis when examining
functional imaging datasets would also be of interest.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        B.    Child and Adolescent Treatment and Preventive
Intervention Research.  An estimated one in ten children and adolescents
 in the United States\n        suffers from mental illness severe enough
 to cause some level of impairment. Yet, it remains unclear what
treatments are the best and safest for these\n        developing age
groups. A priority for this program is to support research and
development of novel psychopharmacological or psychosocial approaches
for\n        the treatment and prevention of mental illness in childhood
 and adolescence, in subjects aged 18 and below.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n               The goal of this research is broad and inclusive with
respect to the heterogeneity of patients, the severity and chronicity of
 disorders, and\n        the range of outcomes measured. Disorders
studied include all mental and behavioral disorders. Interventions
studied include pharmacologic approaches\n        (individual and
combination medications), somatic approaches, behavioral and
psychotherapeutic approaches. Research is supported on individual and\n
       combined approaches. Research that translates findings on basic
physiological or behavioral processes into novel preventive or treatment
 interventions\n        is especially encouraged. Effectiveness studies
that focus on interventions of known efficacy are assigned to the
Division of Services and Intervention\n        Research.\n    \n    \n
  \n    \n               Human subjects include child and adolescent age
 groups covering the full range of mental disorders individually and in
complex patterns of\n        comorbidity with other mental disorders and
 behavioral problems (e.g., anxiety and depression) and substance abuse
(e.g., depression and alcohol\n        abuse).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
        1.   Pharmacologic Treatment Intervention. Clinical testing of
novel mechanism therapeutics is the principle aim of this technology\n
      development section. This includes Phase IIa and proof of concept
studies in pediatric subjects. It is expected the pharmacologic agents
selected for\n        these studies be IND-ready and based on novel
molecular targets identified through basic and clinical research,
preclinical research and animal model\n        research relevant to
understanding developmental aspects of mental illness.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        2.   Combined Intervention. Areas include all research
that combines different treatment modalities in a single combined or\n
      comparative protocol (e.g., pharmacologic plus psychosocial
intervention).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   Psychosocial
Intervention. Areas include development and application of new
psychotherapeutic, behavioral, and psychosocial\n        treatments,
based on the latest advances in development neuroscience.\n    \n    \n
   \n    \n        4.   Preventive Intervention Program. Areas include
preventive intervention studies in which efficacy has not been
demonstrated,\n        including those designed to reduce the risk of
onset or delay onset of mental disorders, dysfunctions and related
problems within asymptomatic and\n        subclinical populations and
those related to treatment (e.g., prevention of relapse, recurrence) or
side effects (prevention\/ minimization of tardive\n        dyskinesia,
etc.). Prevention studies that focus on behavioral problems, without a
focus on a specific mental health disorder or a specific domain of\n
    function that significantly impacts a mental health disorder (e.g.
cognitive function) should contact NICHD.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
   5.   Development and Maintenance of Clinical Trial Networks. Areas
include the development of hardware\/software to facilitate research\n
      collaborations in conducting clinical trials, technologies to
facilitate data sharing, merging of multiple data sets, and the
development and\n        maintenance of common protocols across research
 sites working on a common pediatric preventive or treatment
intervention.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        C.    Science Education
in Mental Disorders.  There is a critical need for improvement in
science education, particularly in areas specifically related\n
to brain, behavior and mental illness. Examples include:\n    \n    \n
  \n    \n        1.   Research on the best ways to present neuroscience
 and behavioral science information, in the context of mental health
disorders, to particular\n        groups of students (e.g., kindergarten
 through sixth grade).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.
Computer-based systems to teach students how to observe scientific
phenomena related to the brain, behavior and mental illness, and to
report them\n        clearly in writing.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  3.   Research on better ways to communicate new knowledge and
directions of scientific growth in the area of neuroscience and mental
illness to\n        teachers and curriculum developers.\n    \n    \n

Treatment Development (DATR)",
        "description": "\n    \n    \n    \n        The DATR is
responsible for planning, directing and supporting programs of research,
 research training, research dissemination and resource development\n
     aimed at understanding the pathophysiology of mental illness and
hastening the translation of behavioral science and neuroscience
advances into\n        innovations in clinical care. The Division
supports a broad portfolio of pre-clinical and human clinical studies
that focus on the phenotypic\n        characterization and risk factors
for major psychiatric disorders. In addition , the Division studies
psychiatric disorders of late life. The division\n        is comprised
of four branches. These branches are: The Adult Psychopathology and
Psychosocial Intervention Research Branch, The Clinical Neuroscience\n
      Research Branch, the Geriatrics Research Branch and the
Experimental Therapeutics Branch. This division also includes a program
on Traumatic Stress\n        Disorders Research. Their respective
functions are as follows:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Adult
Psychopathology and Psychosocial Intervention Research Branch. This
branch promotes the integration of basic behavioral and neuroscience
findings\n        into translational research on the foundations of
psychopathology and functional disability. The branch targets new
science based assessment,\n        prevention, treatment and
rehabilitation practices including research on causal risk and
protective factors for mental disorders, mechanisms that\n
convert vulnerability into psychiatric symptoms and disability and use
of modern psychometric and statistical theories to advance nosology
and\n        assessment. Other specific areas of emphasis include mood,
eating disorders, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        Clinical Neuroscience Branch. The focus of this branch
is on the understanding of the neural basis of mental disorders. Human
and animal studies are\n        supported on the molecular, cellular and
 systems level of brain function designed to elucidate the
pathophysiology of mental disease and to translate\n        these
findings to clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention. These
approaches are applied to the spectrum of mental disorders including\n
      schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder and
other brain disorders. Areas of emphasis include: identification of
valid and unique\n        neurophysiological markers or complexes of
markers for the major mental disorders and development of animal and or
computational models that accurately\n        mimic complex
neurophysiology or behaviors characteristic of mental illness.\n    \n
  \n    \n    \n        Geriatrics Research Branch. This branch focuses
on research and resource development in the etiology, pathophysiology
and course of mental disorders of\n        late life as well as in the
treatment and rehabilitation of persons with these disorders. Disorders
studied include mood, anxiety and personality\n        disorders,
psychotic disorders and schizophrenia, psychiatric syndromes and
behavioral disorders in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and related dementias,
suicide,\n        and eating disorders. Selected areas of emphasis
include: development of more reliable and valid phenotypes, assessments
and biological and behavioral\n        markers for late-life mental
disorders; development of improved treatment and preventive intervention
 techniques for use in geriatric care settings;\n        and
identification of genetic, brain imaging and other predictors of
variability in older adults\u2019 treatment response.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        Experimental Therapeutics Branch. This branch supports
multidisciplinary research on novel pharmacological approaches to the
treatment of mental\n        disorders, evaluation of existing
treatments of mental disorders, development and assessment of putative
biomarkers of psychiatric disease and\n        treatment response and
development and testing of novel treatments. Studies supported include
early phase clinical studies of new medications, studies\n        to
predict treatment response and studies to validate biomarkers or
predictors of therapeutic response to pharmacological intervention. Side
 effects of\n        therapeutic agents are also given emphasis.\n    \n
    \n    \n    \n        Traumatic Stress Disorders Research Program.
This program supports integrating basic behavioral and neuroscience
findings into translational research\n        on psychopathology
associated with trauma exposure. Areas of emphasis include developing
disorder and risk assessment tools based on individual\n
differences, the development of treatment and preventive interventions
for posttraumatic disorders, and identifying mechanisms of therapies
and\n        mechanisms of disorder that are impacted by therapies. This
 program also supports a broader continuum of research (basic science,
clinical practice,\n        and health care system factors) focused on
the mental health consequences of mass trauma and violence (e.g. war,
terrorism, natural and technological\n        disaster), including
interventions and service delivery in children, adolescents, and adults
impacted by mass trauma.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        All
applications relevant to the mission of the Division of Adult
translational Research and Treatment Development will receive full
consideration.\n        Possible areas for future research include:\n
 \n    \n    \n    \n        A.    Instrumentation for Clinical
Research. Up-to-date hardware\/software systems that use the most recent
 technological advances are needed to\n        identify CNS
dysfunction(s) related to mental disease. Once these dysfunctions are
identified and localized, rational therapies can be developed and\n
   evaluated.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Physiological and
Behavioral Monitoring: Technologies are needed to continuously
monitoring physiological data (e.g., temperature,\n        activity,
sleep duration, EEG activity, ECG, pulse rate) with behavior,
noninvasively and without impacting behavior. These monitoring devices
should\n        be designed for use with subjects that have a mental
illness.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Data Analysis from
Complex Data Sets: Computational tools are needed to record, catalog,
categorize and identify interrelationships\n        between several of
the above measures.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   Deep Brain
Stimulation Technologies: Improvements in deep brain stimulation
technology in human subjects\/patients is increasingly\n
important as this technique becomes more common as a potential treatment
 option for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, depression, and other
disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        B.    Technologies for Adult
 Clinical Research. It is important to develop reliable methods that can
 correctly identify the normal and abnormal\n        components of
cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial behavior in human development.
Computer-based methods of accomplishing this aim are needed to\n
increase the accessibility and reliability of information made available
 to the research community.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.

     vulnerable patients with complex regimens involving multiple
medications.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        f.    Simple-to-use tools
for assessing individual risk profiles for the development of various
mental disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Methodological
Research and Development. There is a need to devise new ways of data
collection, analysis, management and dissemination.\n    \n    \n    \n
   \n        a.   New relatively culture-free taxonomies and\/or
measures of basic behavioral and social phenomena that can be employed
in research across\n        socio-cultural contexts.\n    \n    \n    \n
    \n        b.   Innovative computer-based observation techniques, and
 computer software and hardware that allow on-line methods for
characterization of\n        interpersonal interactions in groups.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        c.   Low cost microcomputer software for the
 recording and analysis of patterns and sequences in observed social
interactions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        d.   Causal modeling
methodology as applied to correlational longitudinal data sets.\n    \n
   \n    \n    \n        e.   A data translation and communication
package for collecting, archiving, and making available existing
longitudinal behavioral sets to the\n        scientific community for
secondary or meta-analyses.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        f.
Flexible user-friendly software for control of timed, multi-modal
stimulus presentation and response collection for experiments on
perception and\n        cognition.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        g.

Intervention Research.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Development
 of novel methods to enhance efficiency of early phase clinical
trials.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Development of novel
assessments of psychopathology suitable for use in clinical research.\n
   \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   Identification of causal risk and
protective factors for mental disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  4.   Development of standardized assessments of psychiatric and
comorbid disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.   Develop
psychometrically sound methods for assessing the cognitive, affective
and behavioral response systems believed to underpin clinical\n
symptoms and functional impairments.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        6.
   Identify valid markers of illness onset.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
     7.   Develop new definitions and measures to assess functioning in
people with psychiatric disorders including self-reports, tests that
simulate\n        real-world tasks and new approaches to ratings by
observers.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        8.   Creation and validation
 of new measures of functional capacity.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

psychosocial interventions to treat mental disorders.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        10. Identify valid and unique neuropsychological markers
 for the major mental and personality disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        11. Identify more reliable and valid phenotypes, assessments
and behavioral markers for late-life mental disorders.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        12. Development of techniques for maintaining or

Ahead: Research Partnerships to Transform Services, A Report by the
National Advisory Mental Health Council\u2019s Workgroups on Services
and\n        Clinical Epidemiology Research,\u201d and the NIMH
Strategic Plan. Examples are listed below:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
    1.   Clinical Trials Methodologies: The development, testing and
refinement of methodologies, instruments and statistical approaches\n
     to facilitate collaborative clinical trials for the prevention,
treatment and rehabilitation of individuals with mental disorders; the
development of\n        innovative trials design (e.g., fixed adaptive,
encouragement, partially randomized preference) the application of
modern technology to enhance the\n        science, operation, and
management of multi-site mental health clinical trials; and the
development of mental health clinical trial archives. The\n
development of portable clinical trial management systems such as
serious adverse event (SAE) oversight and monitoring software.
Adaptation of existing\n        clinical trial methodologies to study
mental health disorders. Development of common data elements to enhance
uniformity across clinical trials with\n        and amongst disorders.\n
    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Science Training and Education:
SBIR applications must focus on DSIR\u2019s research priorities.
Develop, modify and test new and\n        existing technologies,
strategies and approaches to: (1) enhance science and research training
across the educational\/ career pipeline; (2) improve\n
scientific literacy for clinicians and service\/ organizational
providers; (3) encourage entry and retention of individuals with
non-mental health\n        science backgrounds (engineers, computer
scientists, medical anthropologists, law, business) or perspectives
(individuals from under-represented\n        communities) into the
mental health services and interventions field; (4) keep established
researchers and practitioners up-to-date on the findings,\n
implementation, and methods of services and interventions research; and
(5) facilitate participatory research with individuals, families and\n
      communities. This can include the development of science\/
research education materials, curriculum, methodologies and web-based
programs relevant to\n        the mission of the division; the
development of networking and collaborative approaches to research
training in mental health interventions and\n        services research;
and the development of multi-media approaches (combined with traditional
 strategies) to improve the level of scientific and career\n
mentoring that mental health services and interventions researchers
receive.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   Public Health Oriented
Pharmacoeconomics: Develop and test simulation models for estimating the
 amount of total out-of-pocket\n        expenditures (co-payments) for
the most frequently prescribed psychotropic drugs under different
insurance benefit scenarios and\/or under different\n        pharmacy
benefit management scenarios. Models should also be developed to
accommodate common combined pharmaceutical approaches.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        4.   Dissemination: Development of technological
approaches to increase the sustainable uptake of scientifically based
treatments and\n        services across diverse community settings. This
 could include web-based interactive tools for state\/county mental
health or related (e.g., schools)\n        agencies around
implementation of evidence-based practices. Development of innovative
ways (e.g., new technology, use of multi-media) of disseminating\n
  information to stakeholders. Development of new approaches to the
dissemination and implementation of evidence based mental health
interventions to\n        underserved populations (e.g.,
rural\/frontier, aging individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders).
Development of technology to enhance conduct of\n        clinical trials
 and the dissemination of their results.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  5.   Implementation: Application of new technologies, approaches and
strategies to identify and utilize active therapeutic ingredients\n
   in complex community-based services and programs that optimize
functioning and sustain community reintegration of people with mental
disorders. Use of\n        technologies and strategies to assist service
 systems to more adequately plan for transitions (e.g., child to adult
system, prison to community) and\n        seamlessly integrate mentally
ill individuals moving between these sectors.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
       6.   Merging Multiple Data Sets: Merging multiple data sets
(e.g., claims, trials, pharmacy etc.) for innovative and complex
analytic\n        strategies.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        7.
Community Outreach to Diverse and Underserved Populations: Application
of new technologies and strategies to develop, test, and\n        refine
 culturally appropriate materials and approaches to: foster help-seeking
 and engagement of diverse and underserved populations in
research-based\n        mental health treatment and prevention; to
foster participation in community based research by diverse and
underserved populations; and to inform\n        diverse provider groups
about state-of-the-art mental health treatments and services in order to
 facilitate their implementation of these\n        interventions.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        8.   Computerized Methodologies for Mental
Health Services Research: Applications need to focus on computerized
methods to assess\n        mental disorders in primary care settings
including screening devices for identifying mental disorders across the
life-span; development of computer\n        software and hardware that
allow conducting computer assisted interviews with severely mentally ill
 people for research purposes to obtain information\n        on their
quality of care; design work to move assessment as rapidly as possible
to computerized adaptive testing (CAT); apply audio and video\n
technologies to assess patient\u2019s treatment preferences.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        A.    Services Research and Clinical Epidemiology
Branch. The branch supports research on the organization, financing,
delivery, effectiveness, and\n        appropriateness of mental health
care in everyday settings in order to find ways to improve the
effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of mental health\n        services
 (including preventive services) in community and other settings. Also
supported are studies on pharmacoeconomics, pharmaco-epidemiology, and\n
        the distribution, determinants, and course of mental illness in
the context of various clinical settings. Mental health services include
 mental health\n        care provided in specialty mental health and
general health care settings, including primary care, hospitals, nursing
 homes, and other residential care\n        settings, as well as in
educational settings and various legal system settings, such as jails,
juvenile detention and correctional facilities, prisons,\n        and
probation and parole programs. Other services often needed by mentally
ill persons include social services, vocational and rehabilitation
services,\n        welfare, and housing. Relevant services include those
 provided to children and adolescents with emotional disorders, adults
and elderly adults with\n        mental disorders, and persons with
mental illness that co-occurs with physical illness and with alcohol
and\/or drug abuse disorder. Research\n        methodologies include
ethnographic studies, surveys, and analyses of secondary data,
randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental designs, cohort,\n
   and case-control studies.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
Advances in clinical epidemiology, mental health treatment and services
research fields have made it imperative that intensive work continue
in\n        the areas of assessment\/screening technologies, outcome
assessment measurement and measurement packages, dissemination
technologies, data analysis\n        techniques, and the training of
clinicians and providers. The translation of efficacious and effective
treatments into primary care, community mental\n        health centers,
and managed care settings is both a major challenge and opportunity to
develop technologies and systems that will improve the care and\n
 rehabilitation of patients and enable them to profit from the research
advances that have been made. Research is needed on the dissemination
of\n        empirically supported treatments or services.\n    \n    \n
   \n    \n        1.   Methodological Research Program. Supports
studies that involve development, testing, and refinement of
methodologies and instruments to\n        facilitate research on
services for mentally ill persons, including measures of severity of
illness, family burden, social support, quality of care,\n
effectiveness of care, direct and indirect cost of mental disorders, and
 short-term and long-term outcome measures; studies submitted by
statisticians,\n        psychometricians, and other experts in research
methodology and scientific data analysis for work on the design,
measurement, and statistical\n        challenges inherent in conducting
mental health services research.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.

        other behavioral health disorders. Service sectors of interest
include: the criminal justice system, housing and other social services,
 community\n        support, post-trauma services, and adult autism
services. Also relevant are studies to establish the effectiveness of
legal mechanisms relevant to\n        persons with mental illness, such
as outpatient commitment, community monitoring, and guardianship; and
the development of the role and expertise of\n        social workers in
mental health research activities.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        4.

areas. The program addresses care delivered in a variety of settings
such as the specialty mental\n        health sector, the general medical
 sector, and community settings (such as schools). Also, it supports
research that examines innovative services\n        interventions (such
as community-based participatory methods, faith-based) to overcome
mental health disparities related to mental health service\n
delivery and use.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.   Sociocultural
Research Program. Is concerned with strengthening the theoretical and
empirical base for mental health services research by\n        including

 research on economic factors affecting the delivery of mental health
services including the\n        economic burden of mental illness;
financing and reimbursement of public and private mental health
services; impact of various forms of managed care\n        and physician
 payment methods on the cost of mental health care; pharmaco-economics;
evaluation of the impact of insurance coverage including mandated\n
   coverage and mental health insurance parity on access, cost, and
quality; cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of
mental health\n        service interventions; and economic analysis of
practice patterns of different mental health providers. The goal of the
program is to expand\n        understanding of the role of economic
factors in the delivery and use of mental health services and assist in
the development of improved mental health\n        financing methods
promoting high quality, cost-effective care for people suffering from

benefits and insurance; factors affecting\n        impairments and
disabilities during and as an outcome of rehabilitation and other
treatments; rehabilitative services focused on specific domains of\n
    disabilities, such as work and social relationships; and, factors
that influence and sustain community reintegration.\n    \n    \n    \n
   \n        11. Dissemination and Implementation Research Program.
Includes studies that will contribute to the development of a sound
knowledge base on\n        the effective transmission of mental health
information to multiple stakeholders and of the process by which
efficacious interventions can be adopted\n        within clinical
settings. Research on dissemination will address how information about
mental health care interventions is created, packaged,\n
transmitted, and interpreted among a variety of important stakeholder
groups. Research on implementation will address the level to which
mental health\n        interventions can fit within real-world service
systems. Related topics include multilevel decision-making perspectives
about services and\n        interventions in community settings, with
special focus on translating behavioral science into applied research in

significant, innovative, and relevant to its mission. Examples of
research\n        topics within the mission of NINDS that may be of
interest to small businesses are shown below. This list is not all
inclusive and some research areas\n        fall into multiple
categories.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.     Therapeutics and
Diagnostics Development for Neurological Disorders, including biomarker
and diagnostic assays, therapeutics (drugs, biologics,\n        and\/or
devices) for treatment of neurological disorders, and
technologies\/methodologies to deliver therapeutics to the central
nervous system.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.     Clinical and
Rehabilitation Tools, including intraoperative technologies for
neurosurgeons, rehabilitation devices and programs for neurological\n
     disorders, and brain monitoring systems\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
      3.     Technology and Tools, including imaging technologies to
image the nervous system, neural interfaces technologies, and tools for
neuroscience\n        research and drug development.\n    \n    \n    \n
    \n        In addition to the research topics listed, NINDS also
solicits applications in specific program areas. For additional

\n    \n        Clinical Trials\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        The
NINDS is committed to identifying effective treatments for neurological
disorders by supporting well-executed clinical trials. NINDS may
decline\n        funding of a clinical trial application for
programmatic or administrative reasons. SBIR applicants are strongly
encouraged to contact Joanne\nOdenkirchen (contact information provided
below) within the NINDS Office of Clinical Research for advice about
potential clinical trial applications        prior to submission in
order to determine the relevance of the proposed research to NINDS and
its potential for translating discoveries to\n        clinical
interventions for neurological disorders. For more information about
what is generally required before trials are funded, applicants are\n
     encouraged to review the NINDS Office of Clinical Research webpage

 \n    \n    \n    \n        NINDS Cooperative Program in Translational
Research\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Although translational
research is supported through the general SBIR\/STTR program
announcement, the NINDS also has a Cooperative Program in\n
Translational research (PAR-08-235). The NINDS Cooperative Program
encourages Phase II and Fast-Track applications that directly address
the\n        identification and pre-clinical testing of new therapeutics
 for neurological disorders. The program will facilitate solicitation,
development, and\n        review of therapy-directed projects to
accelerate the translation of basic research discoveries into
therapeutic candidates for clinical testing. This\n        program is
specifically directed at projects that include therapeutic leads with
demonstrated activity against the intended disease target. The program\n
        supports pre-clinical optimization and testing of these leads
and projects must be sufficiently advanced that an IND or IDE
application to the FDA can\n        be submitted by the end of the
project period. The program does not support early-stage therapeutic
discovery activities such as high throughput\n        screening. The
program also excludes clinical research, basic research, and studies of
disease mechanism. This is a milestone-driven cooperative\n
agreement program involving participation of NINDS staff in the
development of the project plan and monitoring of research progress. For

Against Chemical Threats\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        NINDS manages
the NIH Countermeasures Against Chemical Threats (CounterACT) program.
CounterACT supports research and development on new and improved\n
  therapeutics or diagnostic technologies to prevent or mitigate the
toxic effects from exposure to chemical threats, defined as toxic
chemical agents\n        that could be used in a terrorist attack
against civilians, or those that could be released at toxic levels by
accident or natural disaster. This\n        includes the development of
new (or support of existing) partnerships between small business and
not-for-profit laboratories engaged in this research.\n        The scope
 of research supported includes early screening for compounds with the
desired biological activity, advanced preclinical and efficacy
testing,\n        through clinical research with promising candidate
therapeutics. For more information on this program, including specific
program announcements, please\nsee:

that innovative and improved alcohol sensors would be useful in a
variety of situations including, but not limited to, clinical\n

characteristics would complement their intended use. This applies to\n

Devices need to be compatible with human comfort, and devices to be worn
 for weeks or months may present particular\n        challenges. Since
alcohol readings are likely to be baseline most of the time, these

        "description": "\n    \n    \n    \n        Alcohol use,
including hazardous drinking, by persons infected with HIV, HBV, and
HCV, is quite common in the United States. Alcohol consumption is\n
   widely acknowledged as a co-factor in the sexual transmission,
susceptibility to infection, and progression of the infectious diseases.
 However,\n        detailed relationships between alcohol use and viral
infections, diseases progression, antiretroviral therapy and adverse
outcomes, notably in liver\n        disease progression, are less
recognized or understood. Recent research indicates that inflammatory
pathways predominate in alcoholic hepatitis whereas\n        adaptive
immunity plays a primary role in viral hepatitis, offering multiple
targets for novel preventive and therapeutic interventions.
Comprehensive\n        studies to improve understanding of the factors
underlying alcohol and viral etiologies in liver disease and the impact
of antiretroviral drugs on\n        liver disease progression are
needed. A better understanding of alcohol\u2019s effects on liver
disease in patients with HIV\/HBV\/HCV infection may improve\n
diagnosis and treatment outcomes. NIAAA supports research leading to
improved diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-induced disorders in people
infected\n        with HIV, HBV, or HCV.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

 Exposure and Alcohol-induced Tissue Injury",
        "description": "\n    \n    \n    \n        Acute and chronic
alcohol consumption leads to health-related complications and ultimately
 to significant societal costs. Quantitative and qualitative\n
markers of high-risk drinking behavior and alcohol-induced tissue damage
 would greatly improve medical efforts to recognize and treat
alcohol-related\n        disorders. Traditional biomarkers currently in
clinical use lack specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy, and fail to
provide long-term information.\n        Biomarkers of sufficient
reliability, sensitivity and specificity are likely to be comprised of a
 panel of physiological parameters, rather than a\n        single
molecular entity. Thus, NIAAA seeks to support the discovery and
development of pattern-based molecular fingerprints or signatures of
alcohol\n        consumption and of alcohol-induced tissue injury. High
throughput approaches using genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics,
proteomics, metabolomics,\n        lipomics, or glycomics are
encouraged. Biomarker signatures may be composed of multiple genes,
RNAs, microRNAs, proteins, or metabolites, or\n        combinations
thereof. Furthermore, alterations in lipid, lipoprotein, or glycoprotein
 profiles may reflect the metabolic effects of alcohol exposure\n
 and may be considered as potentially predictive. Biomarker signatures
that address multiple aspects of alcohol consumption and alcohol damage
are\n        needed. These include, but are not limited to:\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        A.    Biomarkers of long-term alcohol consumption.
 A biomarker panel reflecting the cumulative intake of alcohol over a
period of months or more would\n        be of great diagnostic use, both
 in terms of recognizing problem drinking and in terms of the potential
for organ damage.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        B.    Biomarkers that
 distinguish between binge, acute, moderate and chronic drinking. Each
of these modes of alcohol intake has different\n        physiological
effects. The ability to distinguish dose and timing of drinking would
enhance clinicians\u2019 ability to design appropriate treatment and\n
      intervention protocols.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        C.
Biomarkers of compliance after withdrawal. Biomarker signatures in this
class would be comprised of metabolic products that decrease rapidly
upon\n        abstinence, in contrast to the characteristics of
biomarkers that reflect cumulative alcohol. The ability to detect
relapse accurately will support\n        successful behavioral
interventions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        D.    Biomarker
signatures of alcohol-induced organ damage. The damage due to alcohol
consumption is likely to be organ-specific, with signatures\n
reflecting alcohol-induced damage likely to be different for heart
damage, liver damage, encephalopathy, a dysregulated immune system, or
other alcohol\n        target.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        E.
Biomarker signatures of familial risk factors for alcoholism. Early
identification of subjects predisposed to alcoholism will allow for

        "description": "\n    \n    \n    \n        The development of
effective biochemical markers represents a powerful means for early
diagnosis and treatment of alcohol dependent\/abuse patients and\n
  for the identification of individuals who have a predisposition for
alcoholism. There are two different types of biochemical markers: trait
markers and\n        state markers.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
Trait biomarkers have the ability to detect inborn characteristics of
individuals who are vulnerable for alcoholism. This type of marker would
 be\n        invaluable for screening of high-risk individuals (e.g.,
children of alcoholics) and targeting them with preventive or early
treatment interventions.\n        In addition, trait markers might
assist practitioners in identifying subpopulations of alcoholics who may
 need different treatment strategies. An ideal\n        trait marker
should have several features. First, it should display validity in
detecting people susceptible to alcoholism, particularly before the\n
     onset of alcoholism or during periods of stable abstinence. Second,
 it should be easily and reliably measured. Third, it should be specific
 for\n        alcoholism only and not affected by other medical or
psychiatric disorders or drugs. Since alcoholism is a complex disease,
it is likely that more than\n        one type of gene and protein exist
as trait marker.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        State markers or
markers of alcohol consumption serve several important purposes. First,
they can assist physicians in diagnosing individuals with\n
chronic drinking problems, particularly patients who deny excessive
drinking. Moreover, they may also identify individuals in early stages
of heavy\n        drinking, thus avoiding the long-term medical,
psychological, and social consequences of chronic alcoholism. Second,
state biomarkers can aid in the\n        diagnosis and treatment of
other diseases (liver diseases, pancreatitis, and cardiovascular
diseases) that were, at least, caused by excessive\n        drinking.
Third, they are useful in alcohol treatment and prevention programs.
Since the goal of many of programs is abstinence, monitoring relapse
is\n        important in gauging success. Last, state biomarkers are
important in clinical alcohol trials. Although self-reports have become
more sophisticated and\n        valid (e.g., Timeline Followback), they
still rely on accurate reporting. These new and reliable biomarkers
could then be used to confirm the\n        self-report. Several
biomarkers with certain limitations are currently in use including
carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT), gamma-glutamyl\n
transferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). New state
markers need to be\n        developed that incorporate the following
attributes: validity, reliability, stability, cost, practicability,
acceptability, and transportability.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
Areas that may be of interest to small businesses include, but are not
limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        A.    Develop and evaluate
clinically alcohol-sensitive biomarkers to identify individuals who are

neurobiological, cellular, molecular, chemical, and genetics research
aims at characterizing and\n        understanding drug seeking,

SBIR applications are solicited to discover new chemical compounds as
biological probes either by\n        synthesis or isolation from natural
 resources in studying the mechanisms of action of drugs of abuse. Such
substances could be new chemical compounds,\n        drug products, or

for Treatment of Pain.  Virtual Reality (VR) exposure can reduce
reported pain during wound care. Grant applications\n        are sought
to examine the utility of VR technologies in the treatment of various
types of pain. Development of treatments for both acute and chronic\n
     pain is sought. These treatments can be based in clinical settings
or the patients\u2019 homes. Phase I testing should establish the
feasibility of the use\n        of this technology in the particular
population to be tested. Phase I should also produce data that
demonstrates that this methodology is effective for\n        the
particular type of pain being treated. Phase II should involve
larger-scale testing (e.g., more subjects and treatment trials)
examining various\n        treatment parameters (e.g., timing of
treatment, types of VR environments). The focus of Phase II testing
should be the refinement of this treatment\n        for use in pain
patients.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        David Thomas, Ph.D.\n    \n

Reality for the Treatment of Drug Abuse.  Virtual Reality (VR) can be a
useful clinical tool. In this particular study, VR\n        exposure was
 used to allow patients to selectively not attend to an otherwise
painful procedure. Drug abuse, like pain, is a problem that is
strongly\n        impacted by stimuli in the abuser\u2019s environment
and psychological factors. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that VR may
be useful in allowing\n        individuals to ignore drugs cravings,
withdrawal symptoms or environmental cues that promote drug abuse. Grant
 applications are sought to examine the\n        utility of VR
technologies in the treatment of various types of drug abuse. These
treatments can be based in clinical settings or the patients' homes.\n
      These treatments can be developed to address drug withdrawal, drug
 craving or on-going drug related behaviors. The development of VR
technologies to\n        address abuse of all types of drugs (e.g.,
cocaine, marijuana, nicotine, alcohol, inhalants) is sought. Phase I
testing should establish the\n        feasibility of the use of this
technology for the particular drug problem addressed (e.g., cocaine
craving, opioid withdrawal) and should also produce\n        data that
demonstrates that this methodology is effective for the particular drug
problem. Phase II should involve larger-scale testing (e.g., more\n
   subjects and treatment trials) examining various treatment parameters
 (e.g., timing of treatment, types of VR environments). The focus of
Phase II\n        testing should be the refinement of this treatment for
 use in the treatment of drug abusers.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

\n        7.     Development of a Virtual Reality Environment for
Teaching about the Impact of Drug Abuse on the Brain.  Virtual reality
(VR) is\n        emerging as a technology with a multitude of uses
within the medical sciences. In terms of the science of drug abuse, it
is being developed as a\n        treatment tool. The current
solicitation seeks the development of a virtual reality environment that
 can be used in educational settings to teach about\n        how drugs
of abuse (both illicit and licit) affect the brain and behavior.\n    \n
    \n    \n    \n               The cost of portable hardware needed to
 present a VR environment is relatively inexpensive. If education
programs like the one sought in this\n        solicitation were
available, it is likely that VR would be used as a teaching tool in many
 settings, including classrooms and museums.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
             The particular program sought here is to present an
interactive three-dimensional virtual brain that shows normal brain
functions and, in\n        contrast, brain function after exposure to
drugs of abuse. This technology could illustrate the neurotoxic and
long-term effects of drug abuse on the\n        brain. This VR may
include other features that are not described above, provided that it
will be useful in educating individuals about the medical,\n
behavioral and social effects of drug abuse.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
             The phase I application should develop a beta version of
the program. Further, the phase I application should include a
preliminary\n        demonstration of \u201cusability,\u201d where it is
 shown that the types of people being educated with this program (e.g.
teachers) can effectively operate this\n        system without extensive
 training. Further, it should be demonstrated that the hardware is
easily worn by subjects, and that the subjects can rapidly\n
understand how to effectively interact in the VR environment.\n    \n

Therapies for Substance Abuse Treatment.  Nanoscience and
nanotechnology, by manipulating matter at the\n        atomic or
molecular levels, are emerging research areas that have the potential to
 fundamentally transform the study of biological systems and lead to\n
      the development of new methods for detection, prevention, and
treatment of substance abuse and related disease states. NIDA invites\n
       nanotechnology-based applications in the following areas:\n    \n
    \n    \n    \n        a.   Methods to enhance the efficacy of
FDA-approved compounds by reducing their size to the nanoscale range to
alter absorption, distribution,\n        metabolism, or excretion.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        b.   Development of new compounds, through
manipulation of matter at the atomic or molecular levels that could more
 readily pass the\n        blood-brain-barrier or cell membranes.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        c.   Development of nanoscale particles for
controlled targeted delivery of therapeutics, genes, or antibodies.\n
 \n    \n    \n    \n        d.   Methods to enhance existing imaging
technologies using magnetic properties at the nanoscale.\n    \n    \n
  \n    \n        e.   Application of nanostructures (e.g. noble metal
nanoparticles, quantum dots, and nanolithographic structures that show
promise for diagnostic\n        development) for identification and
analysis of genes, proteins, and other biological molecules implicated
in the actions of drugs of abuse.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  Applications are invited from any of the above areas. Phase I should
demonstrate convincingly the viability of the proposed innovation,
whereas\n        Phase II should carry out the development,
characterization, testing, and screening of the innovation.\n    \n

Genomics Resources and Strategies.  In the post-genomic era, an
explosion of gene discovery studies utilizing strategies\n        such
as genome-wide association scans, microarrays, and proteomics have
identified a host of genes\/gene variants associated with susceptibility
 to, or\n        protection from, diseases of addiction. A critical next
 step is to validate these candidate genes\/variants to determine which
ones play an authentic\n        functional role in mediating addiction.
Functional validation could occur at many different phenotypic levels
ranging from the molecular to the\n        behavioral. Studies could
investigate a few high priority genes\/variants or could test several
hundred genes\/variants rapidly. The development of\n        resources
and strategies that would facilitate functional validation of
genes\/gene variants include (but are not limited to) the following
areas:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        a.   Gene\/variant effects on
subcellular localization, stability, or function of mRNAs\/proteins
relevant to drug addiction.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        b.   The
development of imaging and other strategies to identify gene\/variant
effects on neuronal or brain functions relevant to addiction.\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n        c.   Strategies to identify gene\/variant effects
 on behavior, such as response to addictive stimuli, stress, or changes
in social situations.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        d.   RNA
interference-mediated depletion of candidate genes in cells or whole
organisms to look for phenotypic alterations such as changes in
synapse,\n        dendritic spine, or cell morphology, gene expression,
or behavioral responses to drugs of abuse.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
    e.   Strategies exploiting the growing collection of genetic mutants
 in candidate genes (particularly utilizing model organisms such as
mouse,\n        zebrafish, Drosophila, C. elegans or yeast) to
functionally validate genes\/variants.\n    \n    \n    \n    \nf.
Approaches enabling comparison of wild type protein function to the
function of allelic variants using in vivo transgenes or        in vitro
 biochemical assays, especially if these approaches reveal whether a
variation increases or decreases gene function.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        g.   Systems-based approaches investigating whether a set of
candidate genes is co-expressed in a particular brain region or cell
type, physically\n        interacts with one another, or functions
together in a signal transduction cascade are also of great interest.\n

     Development of new imaging techniques, reagents and related
hardware and software for dynamic investigations of the effects of drugs
 of abuse on\n        cellular activities and communications. For
example, these techniques might include, but are not limited to,
development and utilization of reagents\n        for magnetic resonance
microscopy and other MRI methods; development of methodologies applying
functional MRI to drug abuse studies; the use of dyes,\n
intrinsic signals, and other optical indicators for studying signal

the recent success in molecular cloning of various drug abuse relevant
receptors, enzymes, and other proteins, researchers will elucidate the\n
        molecular mechanism of action of these drugs. Studies to
generate strains of transgenic animals carrying a gene of interest are
solicited. Of special\n        interest are knockout and tissue-specific
 knockout animals. These animals can be used to identify gene function,

Research Branch (PRB). The Prevention Research Branch (PRB) supports a
program of research in drug abuse and drug related HIV\n
prevention to (1) examine the efficacy and effectiveness of new and
innovative theory-based prevention approaches for drug abuse,
drug-related HIV\/AIDS\n        and other associated health risks, (2)
determine the cognitive, social, emotional, biological and behavioral
processes that account for effectiveness\n        of approaches, (3)
clarify factors related to the effective and efficient provision of
prevention services, and (4) develop and test methodologies\n
appropriate for studying these complex aspects of prevention science.\n
   \n    \n    \n    \n               Prevention Research.  Rigorous
scientific prevention research is encouraged to study novel approaches
to substance abuse prevention for\n        use at multiple levels of the
 social environment including: the family, schools, peer groups,
community and faith-based organizations, the workplace,\n        health
care systems, etc. The purpose of this research is to determine the
efficacy and effectiveness of novel program materials, training
strategies,\n        and technologies developed to prevent the onset and
 progression of drug abuse and drug-related HIV\/AIDS infection.
Materials and technologies may\n        target a single risk-level or
may take a comprehensive approach encompassing audiences at the
universal, selective, and\/or indicated levels. Universal\n
interventions target the general population; selective target subgroups
of the population with defined risk factors for substance abuse;
indicated\n        interventions target individuals who have detectable
signs or symptoms foreshadowing drug abuse and addiction, but who have
not met diagnostic\n        criteria. NIDA encourages the development
and testing of innovative prevention intervention technologies that are
sensitive and relevant to cultural\n        and gender differences.\n
 \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Laboratory studies of the underlying
mechanisms and effects of various prevention approaches such as
persuasive communication (e.g., mass media\n        and print media) as
they are affected by and effect drug related cognition, emotion,
motivation and behaviors.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.
Decomposition of prevention programs, practices and strategies to
understand components that account for program effectiveness.\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n        3.   Research on features of prevention
curricula, materials, implementation, approaches, training, technical
assistance, and systems integration that\n        contribute to positive
 outcomes.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        4.   Training modules and
ongoing technical assistance for program implementers of research based
substance abuse prevention programming strategies.\n    \n    \n    \n
  \n        5.   Prevention intervention dissemination technologies and
mechanisms that integrate research with practice; specifically the
transfer of drug abuse\n        prevention information to
decision-makers, funders, and practitioners.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
      6.   Prevention services research on the organization, financing,
management, delivery, and utilization of drug abuse prevention
programs.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        7.   State-of-the-art and
practical strategies for the integration of evidence-based prevention
approaches into existing prevention service delivery\n        systems.\n
    \n    \n    \n    \n        8.   Studies that develop and assess
reliability and validity of developmentally appropriate self-report,
physiological, and biochemical measures for\n        use in prevention
trials in a variety of settings and a variety of audiences.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        9.   Development of and testing of environmental
change strategies for schools, neighborhoods, communities, etc. to use
in reducing substance use\n        initiation and\/or progression.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        10. Development of practical and affordable
community tools for: needs and resource assessment, selection of
appropriate evidence-based programs and\n        strategies,
high-quality implementation of identified programs and strategies,
evaluation at community, organization and individual levels, and\n
  sustainability.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        11. Drug abuse
prevention methodological research on promising data collection, data
storage, data dissemination, and reporting techniques.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        12. Promoting wider and more effective (e.g. with
enhanced fidelity) use of evidence-based prevention interventions for
substance abuse and related HIV\n        prevention, including
interventions made available thru CDC and other federal agencies.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        13. Studies applying technologies and
strategies that have been developed for use in other disciplines in
order to examine the utility of their\n        application for drug
abuse prevention, such as virtual reality technologies being used for
some clinical conditions (e.g. phobias, eating disorders),\n        and
serious video games are being used for some clinical conditions (e.g.,
cancer patients), but not for drug abuse prevention.\n    \n    \n    \n
    \n        14. Development and testing of innovative drug abuse
prevention intervention products, using discoveries from the basic
biological (e.g.\n        neurobiological), psychological (e.g.
emotional, behavioral, cognitive, and developmental) and social (e.g.
social learning, peer network, and\n        communications) sciences.\n
   \n    \n    \n    \n        15. Development and testing of
adaptations for efficacious prevention research approaches to make these
 more appropriate for special populations\n        including racial and
ethnic minorities, non-English speaking populations, immigrant
populations, rural and migrant populations, low literacy\n
populations, or persons with disabilities.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
    16. Development of methods, state-of-the-art tools and systems for
community coalition-building.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        17.
Development and testing of tools to measure intervention costs, cost
effectiveness, and net economic benefits.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
   18. Development and testing of rapid assessment tools of sexual and
drug use risk behaviors for use in health care and public health
environments,\n        including STI clinics and AIDS research
centers.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        19. Development and testing of
 tools to promote security and appropriate prescribing of scheduled
prescription drugs. Technologies can be developed to\n        assist
medical professionals, schools, service providers and others in making
prescribing decisions, educating patients and their caretakers, or\n
    dispensing and monitoring of medications.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
       20. Development of new technologies to support drug abuse
prevention interventions with military personnel, veterans and their
families. Tools can\n        include adaptations of efficacious and
effective drug abuse prevention interventions to maximize health care
efficiencies and to address negative life\n        stress resulting from
 sustained combat operations, a major contributor to both the onset and
exacerbation of substance abuse and mental health\n        problems.\n
  \n    \n    \n    \n        21. Development of new technologies for
delivery and implementation of efficacious drug abuse prevention

dianaa@nida.nih.gov\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        B.    Epidemiology
Research Branch (ERB).  The ERB supports a research program on drug
abuse epidemiology that includes (1) studies of trends and\n
patterns of drug abuse and related conditions such as HIV\/AIDS in the
general population and among subpopulations, (2) studies of causal
mechanisms\n        leading to onset, escalation, maintenance, and
cessation of drug abuse across stages of human development, (3) studies
of person\u2013environment\n        interactions, (4) studies of
behavioral and social consequences of drug abuse, (5) bio-epidemiologic
studies including genetic epidemiology studies,\n        (6)
methodological studies to improve the design of epidemiologic studies
and to develop innovative statistical approaches, including modeling\n
      techniques.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Improvement of
Reliability and Validity of Reporting of Sensitive Data.  The
reliability and validity of self-report of drug use\n        and related
 behaviors (e.g., HIV risk behavior) is a matter of great concern. Use
of new technologies for real time data collection in ecological\n
 settings is of great interest because these technologies enable
collection of drug consumption data in context. Studies to improve
methodologies based\n        on variations of standard survey protocols
or computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) and personal interview (CAPI)
 are also encouraged.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Instrument
Development.  Easy-to-use assessment instruments are needed to enhance
epidemiology research. Areas of interest include but\n        are not
limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        a.   Community Assessment.
The development of community diagnostic instruments for psychometrically
 sound assessment of community\n        characteristics is essential to
improve our understanding of how community factors affect drug abuse and
 ensuing behavioral and social consequences.\n        Standardized
assessments of community characteristics are needed to better understand
 the full impact of drug use and to develop targeted interventions\n
    to specific community needs.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        b.
Assessment of Psychiatric Comorbidity in Community Settings. Easy to
use, reliable, and valid instruments are needed to assess\n
psychiatric comorbidity in different populations of drug abusers,
including adolescents and those in community drug abuse treatment
settings.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        c.   Assessment Instruments
to Measure CNS Function Related to Drug Abuse. The development of
age-appropriate assessment instruments to\n        measure behavioral
and cognitive function over the course of development will contribute to
 our understanding of vulnerability to drug abuse and\n
functional impairment due to drug use.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
3.   Development of State-of-the-Art Mechanisms for Epidemiological
Research.  The development of state-of-the-art mechanisms to
facilitate\n        the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in
 community epidemiology studies (for example Community Epidemiology Work
 Groups) and other drug\n        abuse research is if great interest.
There is a need for enhanced software and hardware for GIS interfaces,
database management, visualization, and\n        innovative spatial
analysis capabilities. The role of GIS in public health management and
practice continues to evolve. Application of this technology\n        is
 an important step towards better understanding drug abuse issues and
their inherent complexities. The ability to evaluate geospatial
information\n        provides a unique perspective of public health
issues such as emerging and shifting epidemics, the utilization of
treatment services, and rapid\n        assessment of the impact of
incidents ranging from natural disasters to bioterrorism. When used
alongside more traditional epidemiological techniques,\n        GIS
provides epidemiologists the ability to address new questions, refine,
or enhance existing analyses.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Bethany

        4.   Improving Measures of Addiction Risk.  Individual
differences in risk for drug addiction are often expressed in degree
rather than kind,\n        that is, as gradations along an underlying
continuum that stretches from unobservable variations in risk for
addiction to extreme and fully\n        debilitating addiction severity.
 Assessment instruments in use today for measuring drug addiction (i.e.,
 compulsivity in seeking and using drugs\n        despite harmful
consequences) have proven reliability and validity, but are of limited
use for evaluating individual differences in risk for drug\n
addiction. Advances in computerized adaptive testing methods,
computer-assisted technologies, and psychometrics, including item
response theory,\n        suggest that the capabilities now exist for
the development of the next generation in addiction assessment. New
assessment instruments are needed to\n        detect meaningful
variation between, within, and across individuals over time that is
scalable along the dimension of risk for addiction; these\n
instruments should allow for efficient assessment of the risk construct
with minimal burden for administration, training, and cost to the
researcher,\n        clinician, research participant, or patient; and
they should ultimately provide valid and reliable scores corresponding
to established diagnostic\n        criteria for substance use
disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Elizabeth Lambert, M.Sc.\n

Developing, Validating, Refining Tools for Ecologic Momentary
Assessment.  Ecologic Momentary Assessment (EMA) includes the
measurement\n        of exposures and events in real time as they occur,
 and in the natural environment where they occur, such as the home,
neighborhood, or workplace. EMA\n        tools include portable
technologies for longitudinal data collection in the field, such as
mobile phone electronic diaries and PDAs, geopositioning\n
devices, motion sensors, biosensors, environmental sensors, and
audiovisual devices. In addiction and behavioral research, new EMA tools
 may enhance\n        the contextual and temporal resolution of
exposures, and the biological or behavioral processes presumed to occur
in response. Specific challenges to\n        address in the
implementation of EMA include optimizing the timing of measurement and
data quality, establishing sensor validity and reliability in\n
different populations, reducing intensely longitudinal data for
statistical analysis, achieving user acceptability, and safeguarding
user privacy.\n        Studies are encouraged that address these and
other challenges to improve the validity and acceptability of EMA
tools.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Louise Eideroff, Ph.D.\n    \n

Services Research Branch (SRB).  The SRB supports a program of research
on the effectiveness of drug abuse treatment with a focus on the
quality,\n        cost, access to, and cost-effectiveness of care for
drug abuse dependence disorders. Primary research foci include: (a) the
effectiveness and\n        cost-benefits and cost-effectiveness of drug
abuse treatment, (b) factors affecting treatment access, utilization,
and health and behavioral outcomes\n        for defined populations, (c)
 the effects of organization, financing, and management of services on
treatment outcomes, (d) drug abuse service delivery\n        systems and
 models, such as continuity of care, stages of change, or service
linkage and integration models, and (e) drug abuse treatment services
for\n        HIV seropositive patients and for those at risk of
infection.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Drug Abuse Treatment
Economic Research.  This initiative will support research to design and
develop data systems for financial\n        management and economic
analysis of treatment programs and larger systems in new healthcare
settings and managed care networks. Managerial\n        decision-making
requires the implementation of sophisticated data systems to facilitate
routine budgeting processes, allocation of resources,\n
performance measurement, and pricing decisions. The focus is on the
needs of managers within the organization and managers outside of the
organization.\n        Data system development must be based on standard
 cost behavior and profit analysis. Data systems must be designed with
correct cost concepts\n        (accounting and economic) in order to
permit cost and pricing decisions to be developed for new treatment
technologies and management of ongoing\n        systems. In research
settings, such an initiative is vital for the assessment of new
technologies developed for transfer to practice.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        2.   Determining the Costs of Implementing Evidence-Based
Practices (EBPs) and Other Technologies in Drug Abuse Treatment.
Research shows\n        that new technologies or evidence-based
practices (EBPs) can improve drug treatment outcomes, and it has been
asserted that large-scale drug abuse\n        treatment improvement
requires systematic implementation of proven practices, processes, and
technologies. Often, however, new drug treatment\n        approaches are
 not adopted or sustained in usual practice, even in programs that
served as settings for research showing their effectiveness. This may\n
       be due in part to a poor understanding of the initial or ongoing
costs entailed by new practices, processes, or technologies (hereafter
referred to as\n        technologies). Methods and tools need to be
developed and tested to help drug abuse treatment service providers and
payers arrive at realistic\n        estimates of the costs of
implementing and sustaining new technologies in usual practice settings.
 With regard to new technologies, implementing is\n        defined as an
 ongoing process of selecting, adopting, and adapting these new
technologies into ongoing treatment, particularly with consideration
for\n        the local setting, population and available resources.
Sustaining is defined as an ongoing process of providing needed
resources (such as staffing,\n        training, and equipment),
maintaining the quality of the new technology through evaluation,
monitoring, and improvement, and determining its ongoing\n
utility compared to alternatives. The tools and methodologies should be
able to identify and estimate costs separately for implementing and
for\n        sustaining new technologies, and should consider both
clinical and administrative technology. At a minimum, domains in which
costs should be estimated\n        include assessment of programmatic
need, appropriateness, and value; staffing qualifications (salary and
competencies); training, support, equipment,\n        and other
infrastructure requirements; information \/ data requirements; quality
monitoring and improvement; and evaluation of outcomes.\n    \n    \n

 is showing that employee turnover is a substantial\n        problem
among substance abuse treatment services providers. Applications
supporting innovative research that develops and validates generic
staff\n        selection systems which could be adopted and tailored for
 use by drug abuse treatment clinics are welcome. Like many small
businesses, drug abuse\n        treatment clinics have problems
attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Also like many small
businesses, treatment clinics have limited resources\n        to apply
to the recruiting, screening, and hiring of new and replacement
personnel. Research has shown that the application of standardized
screening\n        and selection methods designed to maximize person-job
 fit can cost-effectively reduce staff turnover. Systematic methods such
 as background\n        inventories, protocol-driven interviews,
aptitude tests, and credit checks have demonstrated validity for
improving person-job fit. Examples of\n        possible projects might
include development of easy-to-understand guidance about legal
considerations in hiring practices, software that transform job\n
 task analysis into selection criteria, interview protocols to
standardize applicant screening, tolls to help improve recruitment,
and\/or self-paced\n        training for hiring officials or interview
panels to improve screening reliability.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  4.   Customer Retention Technology.  Premature disengagement from drug
 abuse treatment participation is a common problem and ranges from\n
    approximately 30 to 60% based upon the clinic and modality studied.
Past research has very frequently attributed dropping out of treatment
to\n        participant characteristics (e.g., motivation, addiction
severity, comorbidity) and\/or environmental factors (e.g., social
pressures, unemployment,\n        homelessness). Seldom has the dropout
problem been studied in the context of customer satisfaction. That is,
there is little research looking at the\n        causes of dropping out
of treatment attributable to organizational factors (e.g., policies,
practices, context) that influence participant withdrawal\n
decisions. Needed are tools and systems for assessing and surveying drug
 abuse treatment program participant perceptions and satisfaction
levels,\n        summarizing and report participant assessments,
interpreting results, and adjusting policies and practices to improve
satisfaction and participant\n        retention in treatment.\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n        5.   Effective Management and Operation of Drug
Abuse Treatment Services Delivery.  The bulk of drug abuse treatment is
conducted in small\n        clinical settings with therapeutic staffs of
 less than a dozen people. Small clinics lack resources to help improve
efficiency and effectiveness in\n        both business and therapeutic
practices. Areas that may be of interest to small businesses include,
but are not limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        a.
Computer-based leader\/manager self assessment tools: On-line and other
types of tools to help those supervising the delivery of drug abuse\n
     treatment services to gain insights about personal strengths and
weaknesses, and to help guide them to improved leadership and management
 practices.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        b.   Organizational change
tools: Handbooks describing step-by-step way to introduce more efficient
 business practices such as quality\n        management\/monitoring,
creating empowered work teams, formalized goal setting, improved
customer relations, forming organization linkages, and adopting\n
 new fiscal and resource management techniques.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        c.   Organizational change tools: Handbooks describing
step-by-step ways to introduce more efficient or effective therapeutic
practices such as, adding\n        pharmacotherapy in a previously
drug-free clinic, adopting new medical\/pharmacotherapy or behavioral
interventions, and adopting new approaches to\n        clinical
collaboration and\/or case management.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
6.   Assessment Tools for Quantifying and Organizational Culture that
Promotes and Sustains a Drug-Free Workforce.  Though drug-free
workplace\n        programs are ubiquitous in large businesses, small
businesses often lack the staff and resources to create effective
drug-free programs because they\n        may involve in-house or
contract experts to educate, train, monitor, and enforce policies and
practices that will sustain a healthy workforce and a\n        safe and
healthy workplace. Though there are numerous model drug-free workplace
policies and programs provided free by federal, state, and local\n
  governments as well as nongovernmental organizations, many fail to
provide management with affordable or free, easy-to-use tools to assess
the baseline\n        of their organizations\u2019 culture for drug
abuse intolerance, and to monitor progress in building a drug-free
organizational culture. Research shows that\n        individual
employees and organizations vary in their support for a drug-free
workplace. Surveys indicate that coworker tolerance for illicit drug
use\n        varies by the type of drug, the type of industry, and the
work role of the respondents. A drug-free culture creates commonly-held
attitudes, beliefs\n        and practices among employees that are
socially reinforced. Once established, the need for costly external
incentives and other measures abates as\n        coworkers socialize new
 incumbents and enforce behavior promoting abstinence. Tools and
methodologies need to be developed to a) assess an\n
organization\u2019s baseline culture for drug abuse intolerance both on
and off the job, b) identify policies and practices that undermine a
drug-free\n        culture, c) enable the identification of programs,
policies, and practices capable of helping the workforce
develop\/strengthen an organizational\n        culture of intolerance
for drug use, and d) estimate the impact on the organization\u2019s
quality of work-life, job safety, individual and group\n
performance and productivity, and the profitability of the organization
itself. Included would be inexpensive and easy to use tools for
monitoring\n        workforce behavior change, and changes in the impact
 on the organization (as outlined in \u201cd\u201d).\n    \n    \n    \n

Technologies: Transporting Services Research to Practice.  This
initiative will support the development and testing of the\n
effectiveness of web-based technologies that facilitate the translation
of drug abuse prevention and treatment services research into practice.
The\n        ultimate goal is the delivery of efficacious, low-cost
interventions to the greatest number of individuals in community
settings. Delivery of\n        evidence-based services in community
settings often is hampered by lack of state-of-the-art information about
 the contents of efficacious\n        interventions, the organizational
structures and processes that make effective implementation possible,
and available training and technical\n        assistance. Applications
may include, but are not limited to, the development and testing of new
and innovative Internet-based systems that provide\n
practitioners with (a) current information on evidence-based treatments
with the greatest promise for defined populations of drug abusers; (b)\n
        assistance in translating clinical trials data into clinically
useful information; (c) information and training on how to effectively
organize, manage,\n        and deliver evidence-based prevention and
treatment services; (d) strategies for organizational change and
capacity building; and (e) access to\n        training and technical
assistance on the adoption of new prevention and treatment
interventions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n8.          New Technologies for
 Screening, Assessing, and Preventing Problem Drug Use and HIV, Matching
 Patients with Appropriate Treatment Services. \n        Increased
understanding of the complexities of problem drug use and HIV risk
behaviors has sparked growing interest in and increased need for new\n
      user-friendly technologies to assist in the screening, assessment,
 and prevention of drug abuse and HIV, and in the matching of patients
with\n        appropriate treatment services. New technologies,
including CD-ROM, hand-held, Internet, videotape, videodisc, and other
electronic means have great\n        potential for helping treatment
providers in specialty and non-specialty care settings including primary
 care contexts to (a) screen for problem drug\n        use and
associated health problems and risk behaviors, including HIV, (b) assess
 the nature and degree of drug use and HIV risk behaviors, (c) embed\n
      items for screening or assessing problem drug use within existing
clinical tools, (d) deliver appropriate prevention interventions, and
(e) identify\n        appropriate types and levels of treatment services
 for patients based on their individual treatment needs. These new
technologies potentially can\n        provide a more cost effective way
of identifying problem drug use, HIV risk behaviors and infection, and
associated health problems in a variety of\n        health care
settings, speeding the assessment and treatment process, and improving
treatment placement decisions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Dionne

        9.   Reintegration of Criminal Offenders into the Community.
Many offenders enter the criminal justice system with drug abuse
problems and\n        related health issues. In addition to addressing
these health care issues within the prison walls, treatment programs are
 increasingly called upon to\n        help offenders successfully
reintegrate into the community following incarceration. This often means
 helping offenders to manage their recovery through\n        monitoring,
 linkage with continuing care services, development of social support
networks, and education of friends and family members about the nature\n
        of drug abuse and the challenges facing the offender upon
release from prison. It is estimated that over the next several years,
more than 600,000\n        criminal justice offenders, many of whom have
 drug abuse problems, per year will be released to return to their
communities. New technologies are\n        needed to help treatment
providers in the criminal justice system and in the community coordinate
 efforts to effectively (a) monitor offenders\u2019\n        recovery
once they have been released into the community, (b) prevent relapse,
(c) identify relapse early and efficiently re-engage released
offenders\n        in appropriate treatment, (d) link released offenders
 with continuing care services in the community, (e) develop social
support networks for recently\n        released offenders in recovery,
and (e) educate offenders\u2019 family members so that they can more
effectively support offenders in recovery once they\n        have been
released from prison.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Dionne Jones,

 10. Technologies to Support Quality Improvement in Addiction Treatment
Systems.  New technologies to support quality improvement in\n
community-based, addiction treatment provider systems are needed.
Quality improvement methods, although well established in business and
healthcare\n        management, are underutilized in addiction
treatment. Addiction treatment systems have limited resources for
initiating, developing, implementing, and\n        sustaining quality
improvement practices. Most community-based provider systems have
limited capacity to capture and integrate information about (a)\n
 the nature and extent of community needs and resources; (b)
organizational and management processes to facilitate adoption,
adaptation, implementation,\n        and sustained use of science-based
innovations; (c) implementation costs for new service innovations; (d)
client satisfaction; and (e) quality of care.\n        Centralized,
automated and cost-efficient technological tools for these purposes
could help provider systems improve the quality and efficiency of\n
   their treatment services, meet accreditation requirements, and reduce
 operating costs.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Bennett Fletcher,

   11. Electronic Drug Abuse Treatment Referral Systems for Physicians.
 Research shows that primary care physicians often do not screen for
drug\n        abuse disorders. While this may be related to stigma
attached to illicit drug use or to a lack of adequate health insurance,
it may also be due to the\n        lack of an adequate referral system
that primary care physicians can use for the patients they identify as
having a potential drug problem. The lack of\n        a referral system
places a greater burden on the physician to secure treatment resources
for the patient, and also places the physician at greater risk\n
if no appropriate treatment can be found. A practical and usable
electronic drug abuse treatment referral system needs to be developed
and tested for\n        use by physicians in primary care settings,
including doctor\u2019s offices. To be effective and useful, the system
needs to be targeted at local needs, for\n        example by taking into
 account local private insurance coverage and the types of insurance
accepted by local treatment providers. It should also\n        include
an actively-maintained database of local providers, with information on
insurance carrier, geographic \u201ccatchment\u201d area of treatment
providers,\n        types of substance disorders treated, types of
co-occurring disorders (mental disorders, etc.) treated, gender, age,
other pertinent treatment factors\n        needed by primary care
physicians to make appropriate referrals. The system should be designed
to be reliable and efficient, allowing for appointment\n
scheduling or other needed arrangements to ensure a successful referral.
 Feasibility and cost-efficiency should be carefully considered.\n    \n

the Clinical Trials Network (CTN) is to improve the quality of drug
abuse treatment throughout the country using science as the vehicle.\n
      The CTN provides an enterprise in which the National Institute on

studies of behavioral, pharmacological, and integrated behavioral and
pharmacological treatment interventions of therapeutic effect\n

scudderq@nida.nih.gov\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Specific projects
 could include:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.     Development of
Combination Medication for Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose in the
 Presence of Benzodiazepines.  Suspected opioid\n
overdose\u2014coma, apnea and pin point pupil\u2014is treated by the
administration of naloxone, which, while effective, is short-lived.
Patients often leave the\n        Emergency Room, return immediately to
opioid use, and suffer dire consequences as a result. There is
sufficient preclinical and clinical evidence that\n        buprenorphine
 may be a more effective medication for treatment of opioid overdose in
such patients. However, the clinical development of this treatment\n
    strategy has been hampered by concerns that many opioid abusers also
 abuse benzodiazepine, and in such patients the administration of
buprenorphine may\n        be hazardous. Fumazinil, a specific
benzodiazepine antagonist used to treat benzodiazepine overdose, can be
co-administered with buprenorphine and may\n        protect such
patients from the ill effects of buprenorphine in cases of overdose
involving both opioids and benzodiazepine. The goal is to develop and\n
       test the buprenorphine-fumazinil combination medication
formulation for the treatment of opioid overdose with suspected
concurrent benzodiazepine\n        abuse.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
   2.     Screening and Development of Partial Agonists at the Human CB1
 Receptor for Treatment of Marijuana Dependence or Withdrawal.  NIDA\n
      seeks applications to screen and\/or develop CB1-receptor partial
agonists for application in the pharmacotherapeutic treatment of
marijuana dependence\n        or withdrawal. The potential benefits of
CB1-receptor partial agonists in the treatment of dependence may
parallel those of safe and effective nicotine\n        or opiate
partial-agonist replacement therapies, where buprenorphine and
varenicline have demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing abstinence
from\n        opioid use and cigarette smoking, respectively. As implied
 by the designations of partial-agonist replacement or substitution
therapy, a\n        partial-agonist medication has core biological
effects similar to those of the abused drug. Importantly however, there
is a ceiling-effect dose with\n        the administration of partial
agonists not present with full agonists such that at high doses, partial
 agonists are less likely to precipitate adverse\n        behavioral or
biological events and to have abuse liability compared to full agonists.
 The phase I project should identify compounds that bind to human\n
   CB1-receptors as partial agonists and, in the phase II, the grantee
should develop and evaluate selected partial agonists.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        3.     Improved Device to Capture and Measure Drug Use
in Oral Fluid.  Oral fluid (OF) testing is a promising method to monitor
 for drugs of\n        abuse. The main advantages of OF is the
simplicity and noninvasiveness of sample collection. Aside of
patient\u2019s\/ study participant\u2019s comfort and\n
preference compared to urine drug screen, the oral fluid sample
collection can be easily observed, obviating the need for special
restroom facilities\n        and same-sex collectors and making
adulteration of the specimen more difficult. Furthermore, infection risk
 is lower than for drawing blood. For\n        clinical toxicology
applications, including use in clinical trials, drug treatment programs,
 physician office and emergency room testing, onsite OF\n        testing
 would offer rapid availability of results for diagnostic or research
purposes. At this point, however, Substance Abuse and Mental Health\n
     Services Administration approval of OF testing has been delayed
because of questions about drug device performance, disposition of drugs
 in OF, and\n        need for improvement of assays. The greatest
current limitation for OF testing is the small number of controlled drug
 administration studies available\n        to inform interpretation of
OF tests. (Bosker, Huestis, 2009) Applications should address current
limitations and present methods to remove obstacles\n        for wider
usage of OF testing in clinical practice and research.\n    \n    \n

Testing for Drugs of Abuse. Clinical Chemistry.2009; 55:11 1910-1931\n
  \n    \n    \n    \n        4.     Improved Technology of Testing
Devices to Remotely Capture and Measure Drug Use in Biological
Specimens.  There is an ongoing need for\n        more accurate,
practical and convenient point-of-collection testing devices for
monitoring drugs of abuse. Current devices that test for illicit drugs\n
        in urine, oral fluid (saliva), sweat and hair have strengths and
 limitations. The goal of this solicitation is to develop new
technologies\/devices that\n        will increase strengths (e.g.
accuracy, practicality, and convenience) and decrease limitations (e.g.
minimum frequency, contamination, and\n        adulteration) of testing
methodologies. New technology might permit testing from remote locations
 (e.g. patient\u2019s or subject\u2019s home) while ensuring\n
real time data collection and transfer into medical records\/study
databases. Risk of adulteration should be minimized to a level
comparable with tests\n        provided in drug treatment centers or
study sites. The phase I application should explore all tests currently
available, especially new technologies\n        allowing for remote
collection of the data. In phase II, the grantee should develop and test
 a prototype.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.          New
Technologies: Integrating Data from Prescription Monitoring Program(s)
to Current Clinical Practice.  In some states the\n        prescription
monitoring program collects prescription data for controlled substances
into a central database that can then be used by a limited number\n
   of authorized users to assist in deterring the illegitimate use of
prescription drugs. Prescribers and dispensers in some states may query
the database\n        to assist in determining treatment history and to
rule out the possibility that a patient is "doctor shopping" or
"scamming" to obtain controlled\n        substances. Limited
time\/resources of busy medical offices are a barrier to obtaining and
utilizing this information to improve quality of treatment\n        for
each individual patient. This initiative will support development and
testing of the effectiveness of new technologies that facilitate
utilization\n        of data collected by Prescription Monitoring
Program(s) in clinical practice. Applications may include, but are not
limited to, the development and\n        testing of new and innovative
Internet-based systems that provide a) practitioners with current
information of their patients\u2019 treatment\/medication\n
compliance; and b) transfers data automatically to patients chart, etc.
The goal is to minimize barriers faced by clinical staff to obtain,
record and\n        utilize the data while maintaining strict security
requirements (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability). These
 new technologies should\n        provide a more cost effective way of
identifying treatment non-compliance and help adjust a treatment plan
according to the needs of individual\n        patients as well as
decrease potential diversion of controlled substances. The phase I
application will explore and describe current Prescription\n
Monitoring Programs and new technologies allowing development and
testing of the application in phase II.\n    \n    \n    \n\n",

Discovery and Toxicology Branch (MDTB).  The MDTB supports research on
the development of preclinical behavioral models (e.g., of\n
craving, drug-seeking behavior, dependence, or relapse), biochemical
assays, gene expressional assays and electrophysiological methods to
identify and\n        characterize new medications to treat substance
abuse, as well as pharmacological screening of novel compounds to

treatment medications with abused substances. Areas that may be of
interest to small businesses include, but are not limited to
development\n        of new methods for discovery of medications useful
in treating drug addiction. Of special interest would be the development
 of new animal models of\n        addiction, incorporating established

(MRGB).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Develop Novel Treatments
for SRDs.  The MRGB seeks to support the development of novel
pharmacotherapeutic- and immunological treatments\n        for persons
with substance-related disorders (SRDs). The Branch also supports
projects aimed at incorporating technological advances that could be
used\n        to more effectively treat SRDs.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
             This solicitation aims to support small business
development of compounds that have completed (or are nearing completion
of) successful\n        preclinical evaluation. Treatments should aim to
 help subjects reduce drug use, become drug free, prolong
abstinence\/reduce craving, or facilitate\n        survival from drug
overdose.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n              Therapies that small
businesses might consider evaluating include, but are not limited to:\n
   \n    \n    \n    \n        \u00b7        A novel (e.g., new chemical
 entity, novel drug formulation) that could be used to treat SRDs\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        \u00b7        A marketed compound (e.g.,
SSRIs, anti-epileptic drugs) that could be used to treat SRDs\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n        \u00b7        Vaccines for substances of abuse
(e.g., cocaine, nicotine)\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \u00b7
 Monoclonal antibodies for substances of abuse (e.g., methamphetamine,
PCP)\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \u00b7        Naturally-occurring
compounds (e.g., dietary supplements) that could be used to treat SRDs\n
    \n    \n    \n    \n        \u00b7        Or, a rationalized
poly-therapeutic combination of pharmacotherapies designed to more
comprehensively treat SRDs\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
Treatments that concurrently help alleviate associated psychiatric
co-morbidities (e.g., depression, schizophrenia, PTSD, anxiety, etc.)
and\/or\n        are focused upon underserved\/vulnerable populations
(e.g., pregnant women and their fetuses, adolescents, racial or ethnic
minorities, women\/gender\n        issues, subjects within the criminal
justice system) are especially encouraged.    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n
        2.   Development of a Test\/Device to More Effectively
Diagnose\/Manage Patients with SRDs.  This solicitation aims to support
the\n        identification and development of an innovative
test\/device that can be used to help more effectively diagnose and\/or
manage patients with SRDs. The\n        use of this novel diagnostic
tool might help to: (1) expedite the development of-, and\/or (2)
enhance existing treatments for patients with SRDs.\n    \n    \n    \n
   \n              Possible diagnostic tests\/devices that a small
business might consider, but are not limited to, include:\n    \n    \n
   \n    \n        \u00b7         An assay\/device (e.g., skin sensors,
oral swabs) that detects a substance of abuse more reliably than
oft-used urinalysis. Optimally, the\n        analytical test\/device
would be non-invasive and easy-to-use, such that it could be used on an
outpatient basis.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \u00b7
Discovery\/development of a diagnostic test\/screen that could help
physicians more effectively manage treatments for patients with SRDs.
\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   Discovery \/ Development of
Biomarkers Related to SRD Treatment Outcomes.  Because drug addiction is
 a brain disease which can change the\n        structure and function of
 the brain, there is a unique opportunity to develop biomarkers that
could reliably predict\/assess SRD treatment outcome. To\n        date,
evaluations of SRDs often utilize subjective measures (e.g.,
patient-reported questionnaires) to assess disease progression and
primary treatment\n        outcomes. Biomarkers represent a more
objective measure of physiological functioning that can be used to
predict, diagnose, evaluate the progression\n        of, and\/or more
accurately assess overall treatment safety and effectiveness.\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n              The goal of this initiative is to support
the small business discovery\/development of reproducible, quantitative
biomarkers related to SRD\n        treatment outcomes. Potential
biomarkers might be derived from underlying variations in DNA, gene
expression, proteins, metabolism, and\/or neuroimages,\n        among
others.         \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        4.   Creation of a
Data Repository\/Software Tool for SRD-related Clinical Research Data.
Clinical data management is currently heterogeneous.\n        Different
investigators use different nomenclatures, definitions, timeframes,
data-collection instruments, data analysis and reporting methods. This\n
        varied (and often inadequate) data management system severely
limits the interpretation of results from clinical trials and
complicates the ability to\n        make data-based decisions concerning
 the overall effectiveness of a therapeutic intervention. Appropriate
collection and standardization of clinical\n        trial data should
permit, for example, more statistically-valid comparisons of treatment
outcomes and data integration, meta-analysis, and aid in the\n
development of more effective, individualized clinical treatments for
patients with SRDs.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n              The purpose
of this initiative is to support small business development of
repository\/software tool that can be used to more efficiently capture\n
        and manage (i.e., facilitate\/standardize collection, storage,
screen\/analyze, report) data obtained from NIDA-funded clinical
trials.\nCollection\/storage of these data should follow HIPAA
guidelines (        http:\/\/www.hhs.gov\/ocr\/privacy\/index.html) to
guarantee the privacy and\n        confidentiality of all study
participants.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Kristopher Bough, Ph.D.\n

        "description": "\n    \n    \n    \n        A.    Behavioral and
 Integrative Treatment Branch.  The Behavioral and Integrative Treatment
 Branch is interested in research on behavioral and\n        integrative
 treatments for drug abuse and addiction. The term "behavioral
treatments" is used in a broad sense and includes various forms of\n
    psychotherapy, behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, family therapy,
couples and marital therapy, group therapy, skills training, meditation,
 guided\n        imagery, counseling, and rehabilitative therapies. The
term, \u201cIntegrative treatments\u201d refers to treatments that
combine behavioral interventions with\n        other treatments,
including other behavioral therapies, medications, and\/or
complementary\/alternative therapies. Behavioral and integrative
treatment\n        research has been conceptualized to consist of three
stages. Stage I, or early treatment development, involves research on
the development, refinement,\n        and pilot testing of behavioral
and integrative interventions. Stage I may include translational
research that incorporates concepts, methods or\n        findings from
other disciplines (e.g., neuroscience, cognitive science, etc.) into the
 development of behavioral and integrative treatments. Stage I\n
may also include research to develop or adapt treatments to become more
\u201ccommunity-friendly.\u201d Stage II includes testing treatments
that show promise\n        and testing the \u201cdose-response\u201d of
treatments. Stage III is research aimed at determining if and how
efficacious behavioral treatments may be\n        transported to
community settings. Stage III may include studies that test treatments
in community settings, with community therapists. Stage III may\n
 also include studies that develop or test methods of training treatment
 providers to administer treatments. Determination of mechanism of
action of\n        treatment is relevant to all three stages. Specific
areas of interest include:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.
Translation from Basic Behavioral or Cognitive Science.  \u201cStage
I\u201d research on the development of behavioral therapies or
components of\n        such therapies that are based on developments and
 findings from the basic behavioral or cognitive sciences.\n    \n    \n
    \n    \n        2.   Translation of Cognitive, Affective and Social
Neuroscience Findings Towards Development of Behavioral Treatments.
\u201cStage I\u201d research on\n        the development of behavioral
treatments or components of such therapies that are based on
developments and findings from cognitive, affective, or\n        social
neuroscience. For example, one may wish to apply findings on the neural
underpinnings of adolescent risk-taking behaviors to target the\n
 developmental needs of substance using youth, or apply findings on the
link between early adversity and the impairment of emotion regulatory
abilities\n        to address the needs of substance using victims of
childhood abuse.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   Treatment of
Sleep Disorders for Individuals in Drug Abuse Treatment.  Recent
research on sleep has shed new light on its importance to\n
psychological and physical health. Sleep deprivation has been linked
with impaired cognitive performance, negative mood, and even decreased
immune\n        function. Drug abusers often cite insomnia as reason for
 relapse, and may use drugs to modulate their sleep\/waking cycles.
However, the treatment of\n        sleep disorders has not been a
primary focus of drug abuse treatment research. The development and
testing of sleep hygiene interventions, alone or in\n        combination
 with behavioral interventions, for use in conjunction with drug abuse
treatment, as a means of improving treatment for drug abuse is\n
needed. Developmentally and age appropriate, as well as gender sensitive
 treatment of sleep disorders could impact on the development of more
effective\n        treatment interventions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

  \n        4.   Modifying Efficacious Behavioral Treatments to be
Community Friendly.  Several behavioral interventions have been found to
 be efficacious\n        for the treatment of drug addiction. However,
there are barriers to implementation of behavioral treatments in
community-based settings. Community\n        settings that treat drug
addicted individuals are reluctant or unwilling to adopt these
interventions for a variety of reasons. Reasons that\n
scientifically-based behavioral treatments are not accepted by community
 providers could include the excessive cost of implementation, the
length of\n        time for administration of treatment, inadequate
training available for therapists and counselors, treatments not shown
to be generalizable for\n        different patient populations or for
polydrug abusing populations, etc. Research aimed at modifying
efficacious behavioral treatments to make them more\n        acceptable
to community settings is needed. Settings might include, drug abuse
treatment facilities, primary care, managed care, after-school or\n
   classroom settings, colleges, and the criminal and juvenile justice
system. Examples of possible studies are those that are designed to
reduce the cost\n        of treatments, reduce the time of
administration of treatments, aid in training of therapists, counselors
and nurses, adapt individual therapies for\n        group situations,
etc.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.   Treatments to Prevent
Escalation from Abuse to Dependence.  Therapies for drug abusers who are
 not yet dependent on drugs to reduce risk\n        of escalation to
dependence and therapies for drug abusers who have not considered or
claim little interest in seeking treatment for their drug\n
problems are needed. Treatments for participants in their natural
environment, such as treatments delivered over the Internet, cell phone,
 or in\n        neighborhood settings such as churches and recreation
centers are desired. A particular focus on treatments which incorporate
engagement strategies for\n        hard to interest groups are
requested. Educational games, interactive video content, fluency based
learning approaches and other methods to help\n        maintain
involvement are encouraged.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        6.
Virtual Reality Applications for Drug Abuse.  Development and
improvement of treatments using Virtual Reality and other new
simulation\n        technologies is needed. New technology may help to
make existing treatments more effective, or may make novel treatments
possible. Behavioral treatment\n        research to develop, modify,
adapt, and test treatments for drug abuse and for co-morbid psychiatric
conditions (such as anxiety disorders) using new\n        technologies
is of interest.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n              Recently virtual
reality simulations have been used to train medical personnel in
demanding medical procedures such as microsurgery techniques.\n
Virtual training allows trainees to gain familiarity with both the
environment in which services are delivered as well as the intervention
techniques\n        without the danger of mistakes impacting live
patients. Virtual reality interfaces can assess skill acquisition and
provide detailed feedback during\n        procedures to help trainees
correct mistakes or avoid making them altogether. In the drug abuse
field, training and dissemination efforts have been\n        hampered by
 a dearth of knowledge about ways to conduct dissemination. Although
trainees often practice on actual clients, this approach has drawbacks\n
        including its reliance on the client or participant\u2019s
schedule and willingness to participate in training sessions and
potential danger to the client\n        or if the intervention is
delivered incorrectly. Libraries of virtual reality simulations of drug
users in treatment or \u201cvirtual patients\u201d are needed\n
to provide experiential training for treatment providers without relying
 on existing patients. This will help facilitate the rapid and
effective\n        dissemination of proven treatment strategies.\n    \n
    \n    \n    \n7.          Virtual Clinical Trials Settings for
Conducting Behavioral Treatment Trials and Addictions Treatment Provider
 Education Trials in Cyberspace.\n         Virtual communities such as
Second Life as well as private web forums offer a unique opportunity for
 behavioral therapy researchers and providers to\n        establish and
conduct online psychotherapy and behavioral therapy development research
 as well as a forum to develop provider \u201cuniversity\u2019s\u201d at
 which\n        various training techniques may be tested for
discovering the most efficacious way to deliver continuing education and
 other training in the latest\n        methods of treating addiction.
Applications are encouraged to develop such a forum and test either a
provider training or behavioral therapy method in\n        an online
trial. As part of this research platform, methods for obtaining consent,
 maintaining confidentiality, collecting data and where needed,\n
 assessing provider adherence and competence are expected.\n    \n    \n
    \n    \n        8.   Remote and\/or Mobile Abstinence and Identity
Verification.  Methods are needed for at home or mobile abstinence
verification which\n        include identity verification. Drug abuse
treatment researchers are in the process of developing web-based and
mobile phone based treatments which can\n        extend treatment beyond
 the clinic walls. Additionally, there is growing recognition by
providers that drug addiction is a chronic disease which may\n
require multiple bouts of treatment. However, currently there are no
means of monitoring abstinence once patients leave formal treatment or
validating\n        progress of patients undergoing treatment located
outside a clinic which provides onsite testing. Monitoring onsite
testing poses barriers to patient\n        privacy but unobserved sample
 donation may be subject to switching and adulterants. Products are
needed which both test for the presence of illicit\n        substances
and which accurately identify the donor of the sample and the time of
its submission so patients can participate in monitoring outside of\n
     formal treatment settings. Blood sampling similar in invasiveness
to a skin prick for diabetes testing or other low risk sampling of other
 tissues and\n        specimens may be acceptable. Scalability and
automation of methods are particularly desirable.\n    \n    \n    \n

Adherence to Medications and Treatment for Drug Abusers with HIV\/AIDS.
 The introduction of highly active antiretroviral\n        therapy
(HAART) has significantly changed HIV\/AIDS clinical care. There is a
need for research related to the development and testing of new and\n
     improved behavioral interventions(alone, and in combination with
pharmacological treatments for drug addiction), in order to facilitate
better\n        adherence to antiviral regimens among drug abusers with
HIV infection, including HIV positive drug abusers with comorbid medical
 illnesses and\/or\n        psychiatric disorders. There is also a need
to develop and test adherence interventions administered or assisted by
technological devices such as\n        computers, the internet, expert
system models, telephone pagers, or hand-held computers.\n    \n    \n
  \n    \n        10. Treatment for Emerging or Specific Populations.
Therapies designed to intervene with understudied populations including
users of\n        drugs such as methamphetamine, MDMA and other club
drugs, marijuana, inhalants, and prescription opioids and
psychostimulants, as well as children of\n        substance abusers in
need of treatment, and drug abusers with comorbid psychiatric disorders
and\/or medical illnesses such as HIV\/AIDS, hepatitis, etc.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        11. Development of HIV Risk Reduction
Interventions.  Research to develop and evaluate behavioral strategies
to reduce HIV risk behaviors in\n        HIV-positive and HIV-negative
substance abusing treatment populations. Where appropriate, risk
reduction interventions should be adapted to patients\u2019\n
age, gender, cultural background and potential cognitive impairments,
and should address compliance with medical regimens. The product of such
 research\n        might be training, supervision, or educational
materials, such as manuals or videotapes that describe the intervention
and its implementation by\n        treatment staff.\n    \n    \n    \n
   \n        12. Woman and Gender Differences in the Provision of
Behavioral Treatments, and HIV\/AIDS Risk Reduction Approaches.  Develop
 and\n        evaluate specific behavioral treatment approaches
targeting drug-addicted women. This may include behavioral therapies,
skills training techniques,\n        counseling strategies, and HIV and
other infectious disease behavioral risk reduction strategies. This may
also include development and testing of\n        training materials that
 specifically address women and gender differences in drug addiction
treatment to promote effective use of research-based\n        treatment
approaches. Training materials may involve treatment manuals, training
videos, CD ROM or DVD technologies, Internet or computer based\n
programs to manage aspects of treatment administration, or other
innovative educational strategies for health professionals using new
technologies.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        13. Behavioral Treatments
 Drawing from Stress Research or Stress-Management Interventions.
Projects are encouraged that apply concepts from\n        stress
research (such as appraisal, coping, and social support) to drug abuse
in innovative ways, or that test the extent to which stress-management\n
        interventions can be applied to the treatment of drug abuse and
interventions to reduce risk of HIV and other infectious diseases.
Examples of\n        stress-management techniques that may have novel
application to drug abuse and HIV risk include techniques that teach
problem-solving and\n        affect-management, restore one\u2019s sense
 of purpose and meaning, prevent burnout in the face of chronic
stressors, increase self-efficacy for managing\n        stress,
inoculate against stressors, train relaxation and meditation, intervene
during crises, enlist social support and system support, and others.\n
  \n    \n    \n    \n        14. Behavioral Strategies for Increasing
Medication Adherence.  Research to develop and to evaluate strategies to
 induce recovering addicts to\n        take medication for a prolonged
time, especially opioid antagonist naltrexone; partial opioid-agonist
buprenorphine, etc. to encourage HIV infected\n        drug users to
comply with medical treatments (HAART) in drug abuse treatment settings;
 or to adapt existing behavioral strategies to increase patient\n
 compliance and cooperation in long-term treatment for drug abuse or for
 diseases associated with drug abuse such as tuberculosis or hepatitis.
An\n        important consideration should be cost and practicality of
use in actual clinical practice or in an aftercare program. The product
of such research\n        might be a manual, which describes the
behavioral strategy, and its implementation by treatment staff or
scientific data regarding evaluation.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

 Behavioral Treatments and Pharmacotherapies.  Development of integrated
 behavioral treatments and pharmacotherapies may\n        enhance the
efficacy of both types of therapeutic interventions. For instance, the
maintenance and detoxification of heroin addicts could perhaps be\n
   optimized by the integration of distinctive behavioral treatments
devised specifically for opioid agonists, antagonists or partial
agonists determined\n        by the heterogeneity of the subgroup of
addicts and the pharmacological differences of the medications.
Integration of medications and behavioral\n        treatments could
possibly enhance compliance with medication regimens, increase retention
 allowing pharmacological effects to occur and\n        prevent relapse
to drug abuse and addiction.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        16.
Behavioral Treatment Research for Drug Abuse and Addiction in Primary
Care.  Recent research has shown that physicians and other\n
clinicians often fail to recognize drug abuse or addiction among their
primary care patients. In addition, a significant number of these
clinicians\n        reported that they did not know how to intervene
with their patients if drug abuse or addiction was suspected. Drug abuse
 related illnesses and\n        morbidity often occur in adults and may
have begun in adolescence. However, very little research has been done
to develop or test behavioral treatment\n        approaches or combined
pharmacological and behavioral treatments for drug abuse and addiction
in primary care settings. The objectives of this\n        initiative are
 to encourage research on the development and testing of innovative
behavioral treatment approaches e.g. screening and brief\n
interventions, use of web-based or mobile technologies used alone or in
combination with pharmacological treatments. Other goals of this
research\n        initiative are to encourage additional research on the
 development and validation of culturally sensitive screening and
assessment instruments for use\n        with youth and adults in primary
 care; and to encourage research on the transportability of efficacious
behavioral treatments to primary care settings,\n        as well as
research on science-based training approaches for changing primary care
clinicians' behaviors regarding their recognition and intervention\n
    with drug abusing or addicted patients. While motivational
enhancement approaches for some drug abusing populations have been found
 to be effective,\n        this behavioral approach has not been widely
used in primary care.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        17.\n        \n
          Using Telemedicine to Deliver Efficacious Treatment to
Underserved Populations in Specialty Addictions Treatment and\/or
General Medical Settings\n        \n        .\n         Telemedicine
programs are being used in urban medical centers to rapidly disseminate
science-based information on new medical treatments. In addition,\n
   approximately one-third of the rural hospitals are now using
telemedicine to improve patient care Studies are needed to modify
existing treatments\n        developed by NIDA researchers for
deployment and testing as telemedicine treatments at remote locations to
 underserved populations. These may be\n        delivered in any patient
 care context including primary care or specialty addiction treatment.
Modification of the treatment content to apply to the\n        remote
patient population and provider training materials to orient the onsite
staff who may not be experienced at delivering the new treatment may
be\n        needed.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        18. Youth Smoking
Cessation.  Smoking related illnesses usually occur in adults. However,
tobacco use and nicotine addiction generally begin\n        in childhood
 or adolescence. Despite health warnings, adolescents continue to
initiate smoking at alarming rates and the majority will continue to\n
      smoke as adults. Adolescents who begin to smoke, develop nicotine
dependence very quickly and exhibit withdrawal symptoms during quit
attempts in a\n        similar fashion to adults. Most adolescents who
smoke, express a desire to quite. To date, research on smoking cessation
 for teen and young adult\n        smokers has not been particularly
fruitful. This initiative requests research aimed at the development and
 testing of smoking cessation treatments\n        tailored to the
specific needs of adolescents and young adults. Consideration should
also be given to gender and ethnicity.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
19. Complementary and Alternative Medicine Therapies (CAM) for Drug
Abuse Treatment.  Research is encouraged on complementary and
alternative\n        interventions for drug abuse treatment either as
the sole treatment or as an adjunct to enhance the therapeutic potency
of existing drug abuse\n        treatments. Any of the five CAM
categories: Whole medical systems, mind-body interventions,
biologically-based therapies, Manipulative\/body-based\ntherapies and
energy therapies would be considered for this initiative (for more
information, see        http:\/\/nccam.nih.gov\/). CAM therapies are
interventions that are commonly used in \u201creal world\u201d\n
settings, but whose therapeutic efficacy has not been scientifically
demonstrated. The product of this research might also be a manual or
video, which\n        illustrates the intervention and how it is
implemented by treatment staff.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Geetha

    \n    \n        20. Developing, Evaluating, and Transporting
Culturally Sensitive Behavioral Treatments for Racial and Ethnic
Minorities.  Minority\n        populations are disproportionately
affected by the consequences of drug abuse. Research to develop and
evaluate behavioral treatments that are\n        culturally sensitive
and relevant for diverse racial and ethnic minority populations is
encouraged. This may include studies of behavioral treatments,\n
alone or in combination with pharmacological treatment, or studies of
behavioral strategies for increasing adherence to taking medications. In
 the\n        development and evaluation of the behavioral treatment,
attention needs to be directed at examining medical, social, and
cultural factors that may\n        influence adherence to the behavioral
 treatment approach and treatment outcome. Also, little is known about
the transportability of efficacious\n        behavioral treatments for
minority populations. Research is needed on how to transport
science-based treatments to various racial\/ethnic populations.\n    \n
   \n    \n    \n        21. Incorporating Smoking Cessation in Drug
Abuse Treatment.  Research is encouraged to develop and test behavioral
and combined\n        behavioral and pharmacological treatments for
nicotine-addicted individuals who also are addicted to other substances,
 such as heroin, cocaine,\n        methamphetamines and alcohol.
Prevalence of cigarette smoking is extremely high among drug dependent
individuals attending drug treatment. Many\n        treatment providers
are reluctant to address smoking cessation with clients either because
they believe that substance abusers are not interested in\n
quitting or because they fear smoking treatment will have a negative
impact on drug abuse treatment outcome. However, studies have shown that
 many drug\n        abuse clients are interested in quitting smoking and
 that the concurrent treatment of tobacco dependence and other drug
dependencies does not threaten\n        abstinence and might even assist
 in maintaining it. Research is needed to develop and test smoking
cessation treatments that can be incorporated into\n        treatments
for illicit drugs of abuse.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        22.
Developing Treatments for Smokers with Comorbid Disorders.  Research is
encouraged that focuses on the development, refinement,\n        and
testing of behavioral treatments for smokers with psychiatric
comorbidity, such as depression, schizophrenia, or anxiety disorders.
Smoking\n        prevalence is very high in individuals with psychiatric
 disorders. These populations generally respond poorly to traditional
smoking cessation\n        treatments. Similarly, medical comorbidities
are widely prevalent and are in need of additional research in adults
and in special populations such as\n        youth, LGBT and homeless
persons. Research is needed to develop and test innovative behavioral
and combined behavioral and pharmacological treatments\n        that
address the unique needs of these individuals.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
        23. Tobacco Cessation for Pregnant and Post-Partum Women.
Smoking among pregnant women remains an ongoing public health concern.
It is\n        estimated that approximately 20-30% of pregnant women
smoke. Maternal smoking during pregnancy has been linked to infant
mortality, impaired fetal\n        brain and nervous system development,
 premature and complicated births, and low birth-weight babies. For
women who do quit during pregnancy, relapse\n        rates vary, but are
 reported as approximately 25% before delivery, 50% within four months
postpartum, and 70-90% by one year postpartum. Children of\n
smokers continue to be at risk for respiratory illness, middle ear
infections, impaired lung function, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.
Sustained\n        tobacco cessation during pregnancy and the postpartum
 period reduces health risks to both mothers and their babies. Research
focused on the development\n        of innovative behavioral and
combined behavioral and pharmacological interventions for
nicotine-addicted pregnant and postpartum women is encouraged.\n
Interventions may be tailored to sub-populations of pregnant smokers,
such as teenage girls, heavy smokers, ethnic minorities, or low SES
populations.\n        Examples of other potential studies may include
the development of smoking cessation interventions that address
co-occurring issues, such as depression\n        or weight-gain,
interventions that include partners or support persons, Internet-based
interventions or interventions that can be delivered by primary\n
 care physicians.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        24  Behavioral
Treatments for Groups.  This includes the development of new
psychotherapy approaches, the modification or testing of existing\n
   behavioral treatments, and the design and\/or testing of innovative
clinical training and supervision methods for dissemination of
efficacious\n        treatments to community settings. Examples of
relevant projects are: traditional group therapies, such as 12-step and
therapeutic community approaches,\n        and newer group therapies
such as cognitive-behavioral and acceptance-oriented approaches; groups
for various populations, such as adolescents, adults,\n        couple
and family groups, gender-specific groups, and groups tailored for
racial or ethnic minority populations. Of particular interest are
projects\n        that address the recent reports suggesting possible
contraindications of group treatments for some populations (e.g.,
delinquent adolescents), or in\n        some formats (e.g.,
less-structured, client-led groups).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

\n        25. Developing Behavioral Treatments for Cognitively Impaired
Drug Abusers.  While there are currently many efficacious
interventions\n        available for drug addicted individuals in
treatment, more can potentially be done to enhance treatments by
addressing cognitive impairments that may\n        accompany chronic
drug use and HIV infection. Many commonly utilized drug addiction and
HIV-risk reduction interventions assume certain basic cognitive\n
 capacities and abilities that may be absent, or impaired, in chronic
drug abusers who may also be HIV-positive. For substance abusers to
benefit from\n        psychological treatment, they must be capable of
attending to and receiving new information, integrating it with existing
 information stores, and\n        translating this input into more
concrete behavioral change. Substance abusers with cognitive
limitations, who may not comprehend the interventions,\n        are more
 likely to drop out of treatment, relapse faster, and have poorer
long-term outcomes in comparison to cognitively intact substance
abusers.\n        Research is needed to develop, modify, and test
\u201ccognitive-friendly\u201d drug dependence treatments that could
lead to improved treatment response and\n        outcome.\n    \n    \n
   \n    \n        26. Interventions to Improve Engagement and Retention
 in Treatment.  Therapies designed specifically to engage and retain
individuals in\n        treatment, especially those at high risk for
HIV. An example could be a therapy that is: (1) sensitive to the age and
 motivational level of the client;\n        (2) is specifically designed
 to respond to the needs of the individual, whatever his or her
developmental and motivational level might be; and (3)\n        actively
 works to increase an individual's desire to remain in treatment.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        27. Development of New or Improved Addiction
 Assessment Measures and Procedures.  Research directed at the
improvement of a currently\n        available measure or the design of a
 new psychosocial, social or environmental measure appropriate for use
in the clinical assessment of youth and\n        adult substance abusing
 populations. Special consideration should be given to a specific
screening or diagnostic tool, or to a specific measure of\n
treatment readiness, treatment compliance, service utilization,
therapeutic process or drug treatment outcome.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
        28. Marijuana Treatment.  Marijuana is the most commonly used
illicit substance in the U.S. However, relative to other drugs of abuse,
 little\n        research has focused on the treatment of marijuana
dependence. Trends in the literature suggest that the types of
treatments effective with other\n        substances of abuse are likely
to be effective with marijuana dependence. Initial studies also suggest
that many patients do not show a positive\n        treatment response,
indicating that marijuana dependence is not easily treated. Research is
needed toward developing and testing effective\n        interventions
for marijuana dependent individuals.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
29. Transporting Behavioral Treatments to Community Practitioners.
There is a need for effective methods of transferring behavioral\n
  treatments found to be effective in Stage I clinical trials to
clinical practice. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, operant behavioral
therapy, group\n        therapy, and family therapy are among the
therapies that have been shown to be efficacious in a highly controlled
setting and may be helpful treatment\n        approaches in community
treatment programs as well. However, community practitioners may have
been trained using other approaches and may not have been\n
exposed to these scientifically based approaches. Emphasis should be
placed on examining mechanisms to transfer effective research-based drug
 abuse\n        treatment information and skills-based techniques to
practitioners in the community. This may involve the development and
testing of innovative\n        training materials and procedures to use
in the training of community practitioners to skillfully administer
these treatments, including the\n        development of highly
innovative technology transfer and communication approaches. Research
testing the transportability of empirically supported\n        therapies
 to the community is an important component of the Behavioral and
Integrative Treatment Development Program.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
          There is also a need for the development of educational
methods to train non-drug abuse health care workers in relating to drug
abusers;\n        eliciting medical histories regarding past or present
drug abuse; recognition of the signs and symptoms of drug abuse;
identification of those at\n        high-risk for HIV and other drug
abuse related medical problems such as tuberculosis or hepatitis.
Development and validation of a drug abuse screening\n        instrument
 which can be administered by primary health care providers, and
training in administering such an instrument is also needed.\n    \n

Modules for Specific Problems or Populations.  Discrete therapy
components that address specific problems common among drug\n
addicted individuals and that can be implemented in conjunction with
other therapeutic services. For example, an investigator may wish to
develop a\n        four session, highly focused, job seeking skills
module that can be easily implemented by a wide range of practitioners
to effectively increase\n        appropriate job seeking behavior. Other
 examples include, but are not limited to, modules to engage ambivalent
drug dependent individuals in treatment,\n        modules to increase
assertiveness in female drug addicts who feel pressured by others to use
 drugs, modules to improve study skills and pro-social\n
interactions among withdrawn substance abusing adolescents, or to
incorporate effective HIV risk reduction techniques.\n    \n    \n    \n
    \n        31. Behavioral Treatments for Pre-Adolescents and
Adolescents.  Developmentally appropriate behavioral treatments for
pre-adolescents and\n        adolescents that incorporate HIV risk
reduction counseling as an integral component of the treatment. This
includes the development of new, or\n        refinement of existing
psychotherapies, behavioral therapies, and counseling (group and\/or
individual). This also includes the development and testing\n        of
manuals as well as other creative, interactive approaches for therapy
delivery that may consider different settings for delivery, such as
primary\n        care, school-based health programs, juvenile justice
settings, etc. Also the behavioral treatments should be culturally and
gender sensitive.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        32. Behavioral
Treatments for Couples and Families.  This includes the development of
new psychotherapy approaches, the modification\n        or testing of
existing behavioral treatments, and the design and\/or testing of
innovative clinical training and supervision methods for dissemination\n
        of efficacious treatments to community settings, for youth and
adult substance users. Treatments that target domestic violence or other
 forms of\n        interpersonal abuse along with substance abuse are
encouraged.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        33. Innovative Technologies
 for Drug Abuse Treatment, HIV Risk Reduction, and Training Clinicians.
 Relevant research would be\n        directed at the development and
evaluation of innovative technologies to treat substance abuse, enhance
adherence to medications, and\/or reduce risk\n        for HIV infection
 or transmission. Approaches should be capable of being readily
incorporated at reasonable cost into various treatment settings. Areas\n
        of interest include Internet-based treatment or training
programs, CD-ROM technology, audio delivery devices, photo therapeutic
instruments, and\n        hand-held computers. Also of interest are
creative approaches for disseminating science-based behavioral
treatments and for training therapists to use\n        scientifically
based treatments for drug abuse and addiction. Such approaches might
include Internet-based education, interactive computer programs,\n
  telemedicine, etc. Finally, approaches which apply therapies with
evidence of efficacy through new media such as web-based platforms, over
 email, or\n        through chat rooms and bullet boards are also
desirable.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Jessica Chambers, Ph.D.\n

Clinical Neuroscience Research.  The Clinical Neuroscience Branch (CNB)
supports research on the biological etiology (determining the
biological\n        basis for vulnerability to drug abuse and
progression to addiction, including studies on individual differences
and genetics) and clinical neurobiology\n        of addiction (exploring
 alterations of the structure and\/or function of the human central
nervous system following acute or chronic exposure of drugs\n        of
abuse), and the neurobiology of development (neurobiological effects of
drugs of abuse and addiction during various stages of development and\n
       maturation, effects of drug exposure on neurobiological
processes, development of methodologies and refinement of techniques
used in pediatric\n        neuroimaging). The Branch also supports
investigations on the cognitive neuroscience of drug abuse and
addiction, the neurobiology of treatment,\n        neuroAIDS, and human
pain and analgesia. Areas that may be of interest to small businesses
include, but are not limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.
Innovative Technology and Tools for Human Substance Abuse Research.
There is a continuing need for the development of methods, tools,\n
   and technology that can be used as markers of or interventions for
brain, genetic or behavioral (including cognitive and affective)
alterations in\n        humans related to the risk, or reliance
(etiology) of, effects of, or recovery from substance abuse. NIDA has a
strong interest in facilitating the\n        identification and use of
cross-disciplinary research tools and materials that can be applied to
human research that will advance our understanding\n        drug abuse.
NIDA also has a strong interest in promoting the commercial adaptation
and widespread availability of discoveries (\u201ctools\u201d) made in
the\n        course of interdisciplinary research to better serve its
mission.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n              The term research
\u201ctool" is being used in its broadest sense to embrace the full
range of resources that scientists use in the laboratory and\n
clinicians use as therapeutics; therefore, one investigator\u2019s tool
may be another's end product. The value of research tools is difficult
to assess and\n        varies greatly from one tool to the next and from
 one situation to the next. Providers and users are likely to differ in
their assessments of the value\n        of research tools. Many research
 and clinical tools are costly to develop and have significant
competitive value to the firms that own them.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
             Of particular interest are methods that could be used to
determine the effects of drug abuse\/ addiction treatments on
neurobiological systems in\n        an attempt to understand the
neurobiological processes underlying risk and recovery. Also of interest
 are methods and tools that can be integrated or\n        expend with
brain imaging techniques or other brain-related measures that can be
used in human subjects.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n              Examples
include, but are not limited to; Development of stimulus-generating
hardware and\/or software for use in substance abuse studies,\n
including neurocognitive tasks, presentation of drug-related images for
the induction of craving or to probe attentional or affective processes,
 and\n        \u201cvirtual reality\u201d types of dynamic stimuli
important in studies of drug abuse and addiction; Remote and mobile
based technologies such as PDA\u2019s, \u201csmart\n
phones\u201d, or web-based applications for measuring cognitive and
affective function in real world environments; Development or
implementation of\n        interventions such as trans-cranial or direct
 current brain stimulation, real-time neurofeedback, or cognitive
training; New infomatic tools for\n        primary data analysis or
secondary data analysis would also be appropriate;\n    \n    \n    \n
  \n              Another example would be methods or technology related
 to development of the human central nervous system and how drugs of
abuse perturb this\n        process. Developmental studies of these
populations presents unique challenges when using neuroimaging
technology. The development of novel techniques,\n        or the
refinement of existing methods, to provide direct noninvasive measures
of brain structure and\/or function that are adapted specifically for
use\n        in pediatric and adolescent populations is strongly
encouraged. Also, neurocognitive and other neurobehavioral tasks for use
 in these populations,\n        especially where they can be designed to
 probe underlying neurobiological processes, need to be developed (for
developmental issues, contact Cheryl\n        Boyce, Ph.D.).\n    \n

Neurochemical and Molecular Imaging.  Measurement of brain
neurochemistry, neuropharmacology (receptors) and gene expression\n
   in humans using non-invasive imaging has lagged behind advances in
these areas in pre-clinical research as well as in functional and
anatomical\n        neuroimaging in humans. There is a continuing need
for development of new ways to measure molecular targets in the human
brain. Examples include, but\n        are not limited to novel
radioligands for PET and SPECT imaging in human brain for molecular
targets (e.g., receptors, intracellular messengers,\n
disease-related proteins), as well as novel methods that use magnetic
resonance imaging or other emerging technologies such as optical
imaging.. The\n        primary application of these methods will be in
basic human research. Ultimately, these measures may also be used as
potential biological markers and\n        surrogate endpoints for
translational and clinical research, drug discovery and development, and
 clinical trials. The scope of the projects may\n        encompass pilot
 or clinical feasibility evaluation in pre-clinical studies, model
development, or clinical studies. Alternatively, the focus may be on\n
      research and development of new technologies for molecular,
neurochemical or neuropharmacological development.\n    \n    \n    \n

Neuro-Rehabilitation of Drug-Induced Cognitive Deficiencies.  The
increased awareness that the brain is capable of substantial\n
plasticity throughout the lifespan has opened the possibility that
intervention can be developed alter brain or cognitive function so as to
 accelerate\n        recovery of brain and cognitive dysfunction. Such
interventions encompass both direct interventions of brain function as
well as indirect interventions\n        based on cognitive or behavioral
 principles.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n              Direct interventions
 include trans-cranial or direct current brain stimulation, real-time
neurofeedback, and deep brain stimulation.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
          Another complementary approach is based on game technology for
 \u201cserious (health-related) rather than purely recreational
purposes. Serious games\n        can provide a completely controlled,
noninvasive, safe and alternative methodology for a variety of important
 studies of drug abuse and addiction. By\n        involving a person in
an interactive computerized situation, designed to be both entertaining
yet directive (i.e., in the sense of covertly shaping\n        desired
behaviors via highly flexible and programmable sets of scenarios),
altered behaviors can be introduced by pre-programming consequences to\n
        counteract and potentially reset undesirable neurobiological and
 neurobehavioral deficits associated with chronic drug abuse.\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n                         Areas of cognitive impairment
related to substance abuse that could be enhanced through the use of
either direct brain interventions,\n        or \u201cserious\u201d games
 include diminished decision-making ability, attention\/concentration
deficits, attentional biases, lack of cognitive flexibility and\n
 problem solving abilities, inability to use feedback to monitor\/change
 behavior, memory impairments,.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Steven

        4.   Measurement of Psychosocial Stress in Relation to Substance
 Abuse.  There is the need for development, improvement and\/or
adaptation of\n        precise and reliable field deployable measurement
 technologies can detect and quantify an individual\u2019s exposure to
psychosocial stress and\/or one or\n        more drugs. Ideally, the
technology could be scalable from selected samples to full population
studies. Comprehensive assessment includes measuring\n
acute\/chronic\/cumulative exposures to psychosocial stress and\/or
addictive substances with a high degree of temporal and spatial
resolution (i.e., as a\n        person moves through environments), and
with a high degree of accuracy and sensitivity to detect meaningful
variations in extent of and response to\n        exposure across
developmental periods (ranging from prenatal to senescence) and among
various population groups. Such technologies may include use of\n
 emerging remote and mobile technologies such as PDA\u2019s, \u201csmart
 phones\u201d, or web-based applications.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

 Development Branch (BBDB) supports a broad research, research training
and career\n        development programs directed toward: (1) an
increased understanding of how developmental processes and developmental
 outcomes are affected by drug\n        exposure and related factors;
(2) an increased understanding of developmental processes that are
relevant to: (a) drug use, abuse, addiction, treatment\n        and
relapse, and (b) risk behaviors related to drug abuse and other health
conditions that often accompany drug use (e.g., HIV infection, STDs);
(3)\n        the use of translational approaches to increase
understanding of these developmental processes; and (4) an increase in
effective interventions aimed at\n        preventing or ameliorating
negative developmental outcomes resulting from exposure to drugs and
related factors across diverse populations (e.g.\n        racial\/ethnic
 minority; rural\/urban, etc.).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.

        "topic_name": "Improving Hospital-Based Antimicrobial Use to
Prevent Antimicrobial Resistant Healthcare-Associated Infections",
        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n
Healthcare-associated infections have been estimated to occur in about
one of every 20 hospitalized persons; an increasing proportion (about
20%) of\n        HAIs are caused by pathogens demonstrating increased
resistance to traditional antimicrobials, leaving clinicians with fewer
treatment choices and\n        putting other patients at risk for
infections through transmission between patients. Over the past decade,
researchers have demonstrated that use of a\n        comparative measure
 of inpatient-antimicrobial use by pharmacists and providers improves
the appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing by providers\n
in hospitals that use these measures. To facilitate this prevention
strategy, CDC\u2019s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)
(HYPERLINK\n
"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nhsn\/index.html"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nhsn\/index.html)
 is launching an Antimicrobial Use Surveillance Option in January, 2011
to allow\n        facilities to report such data and compare
facility-specific usage rates to a national risk-adjusted comparative
benchmark; however, facilities are\n        required to submit these
data electronically using specifications consistent with the NHSN
electronic reporting standards. Complying with these\n        standards
will require vendors of \u201cElectronic Medication Administration
Records\u201d (eMAR) used in acute-care facilities to modify the
applicable software\n        to allow such reporting. After initial
modification and piloting of the reporting from a few facilities to
NHSN, expansion of such reporting as a tool\n        for reducing
antimicrobial-resistant HAIs within acute-care facilities nationally can
 occur. As more vendors enable their products to report these data\n
    electronically to CDC\u2019s NHSN, CDC will be able to provide the
comparative data to drive practice change locally at each reporting
facility and to\n        reduce unnecessary antimicrobial use through
this enhancement of antimicrobial stewardship activities. Research has
suggested that facilities can\n        reduce unnecessary antimicrobial
use through activities such as these within 6 months, and observe
reductions in antimicrobial-resistant infections\n        within 2
years.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Public Health Impact:\n
\u00a0 Successful piloting of submission of data from eMAR systems to
NHSN would provide facilities utilizing the vendor\u2019s software to
report and receive\n        comparative antimicrobial use data as a tool
 to drive local HAI prevention activity. HAIs are reportable in over 22
States, and antimicrobial use\n        stewardship is mandated in
California. Commercialization potential for antimicrobial use reporting
is going to increase as mandates become more\n        common.\u00a0\n
 \n    \n    \n    \n        Examples of specific research areas of
interest include, but are not limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
   1. Develop a technical prototype for aggregating antimicrobial use
metrics (as outlined in NHSN \u2013website) using eMAR systems and
reporting to NHSN\n        within the CDC clinical document architecture
 specifications (HYPERLINK\n
"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nhsn\/CDA_eSurveillance.html"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nhsn\/CDA_eSurveillance.html).\u00a0\n
    \n    \n    \n    \n        2. Evaluate (1) the validity (i.e.,
accuracy) of the data reported to NHSN and (2) the usability by
hospital-based pharmacists.\u00a0\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.
Define a scalable solution and business plan to enhance utilization of
the reporting capabilities by all acute-care facilities using
electronic\n        medical administration record systems.\u00a0\n    \n

Health Effects of National Disasters",
        "description": "\n\tBackground\n\n\tThe physical impact of
Hurricane Katrina occurred over hours and days. The mental health
effects of this large-scale, traumatic event may be fully evident only
over weeks, months, years, and, perhaps, generations. The types of
trauma from such events are many, diverse, and complex. The affected
populations, including both direct victims and those secondarily
involved (e.g., first responders, care givers, care providers,
educators), number in the millions. For these reasons, there is an
urgent need for tools to mitigate the effects of national disasters and
for tools to better understand the relationship between this trauma and
the mental health of those subjected to it. The National Institute of
Mental Health (NIMH) solicits such tools, which may be novel or they may
 be modified versions of existing tools. In all cases, however, the
cultural context of the target population must be taken into account to
assure that these tools are more effective and their use more valid for
that population (whether defined by culture, socioeconomic status, age,
etc.).\n\n\tApplicant organizations based in states affected by national
 disasters, with expertise in research and development of tools
solicited here, are likely to appreciate the relationship between local
culture and tools to be developed. Such organizations are strongly
encouraged to apply in response to this funding opportunity
announcement. Also encouraged under this FOA are collaborative
relationships between the applicant organization and community-based
organizations based in the affected areas. Such relationships represent
powerful ways to not only develop valid and effective tools, but also to
 connect with the members of the community for whom those tools are
intended to provide help.\n\n\tGoal\n\n\tThe goal of this initiative is
to support small businesses to develop commercializable, and culturally-
 and age-appropriate new tools, or to enhance existing tools, to
mitigate or understand the mental health effects of national disasters,
such as Hurricane Katrina, on primary victims, first responders, and
others more indirectly affected by such disasters.\n\n\tResearch
Activities and Examples\n\n\tThe types of tools solicited by this FOA
includes, but are not limited to those used for assessment, prevention,
intervention or dissemination of information about mental health effects
 of large-scale traumatic events. Also solicited are tools to
disseminate relevant information to health care providers and others
(e.g., teachers, religious leaders, community leaders,
etc.).\n\n\t\n\t\tTools may be novel or enhanced versions of existing
tools\n\t\n\t\tIncluded are research tools, as well as tools for
diagnosis, preventative or treatment intervention, or dissemination of
relevant information.\n\t\n\t\tTools may be targeted to researchers
(i.e., research tools), or to victims, health care providers, educators,
 care givers, first responders, community leaders, religious leaders,

 was signed by President George W. Bush requiring SBIR\/STTR agencies,
to the extent permitted by law and in a manner consistent with the
mission of the Department, to give high priority within the SBIR and
STTR programs to manufacturing-related research and development
(R&amp;amp;D). In response to this Executive Order, NIH is expanding its
 focus by encouraging eligible United States small business concerns to
submit SBIR Phase I, Phase II, and Fast-Track grant applications whose
biomedical research is related to advanced processing, manufacturing
processes, equipment and systems, and manufacturing workforce skills and
 protection.\n\n\tThe NIH encourages research related to advanced
processing in the manufacture of biomedical products and the
implementation of new technologies in medical care. New methods,
procedures, measures, and controls are needed for manufacturing a broad
range of technologies and products with unsurpassed quality and to lower
 manufacturing costs for existing and\/or new processes. Research is
also encouraged that can contribute to the containment and reduction of
health care costs and that can improve the cost effectiveness, quality,
and accessibility of the health care system.\n\n\tManufacturing-related
R&amp;amp;D is defined as:\n\n\tManufacturing innovation is fostered by
research and development of technologies that are aimed at increasing
the competitive capability of manufacturing concerns. Broadly speaking,
manufacturing-related R&amp;amp;D encompasses improvements in existing
methods or processes, or wholly new processes, machines or systems. Four
 main areas include:\n\n\t(1) Unit process level technologies that
create or improve manufacturing processes, including (a) fundamental
improvements in existing manufacturing processes that deliver
substantial productivity, quality, or environmental benefits, and (b)
development of new manufacturing processes, including new materials,
coatings, methods, and practices associated with these
processes.\n\n\t(2) Machine level technologies that create or improve
manufacturing equipment, including (a) improvements in capital equipment
 that create increased capability (such as accuracy or repeatability),
increased capacity (through productivity improvements or cost
reduction), or increased environmental efficiency (safety, energy
efficiency, environmental impact), and (b) new apparatus and equipment
for manufacturing, including additive and subtractive manufacturing,
deformation and molding, assembly and test, semiconductor fabrication,
and nanotechnology.\n\n\t(3) Systems level technologies for innovation
in the manufacturing enterprise, including (a) advances in controls,
sensors, networks, and other information technologies that improve the
quality and productivity of manufacturing cells, lines, systems, and
facilities; (b) innovation in extended enterprise functions critical to
manufacturing, such as quality systems, resource management, supply
chain integration, and distribution, scheduling and tracking; and (c)
technologies that enable integrated and collaborative product and
process development, including computer-aided and expert systems for
design, tolerancing, process and materials selection, life-cycle cost
estimation, rapid prototyping, and tooling.\n\n\t(4) Environment or
societal level technologies that improve workforce abilities and
manufacturing competitiveness, including (a) technologies for improved
workforce health and safety, such as human factors and ergonomics; and
(b) technologies that aid and improve workforce manufacturing skills and
 technical excellence, such as educational systems incorporating
improved manufacturing knowledge and instructional methods\n\n\tBecause
manufacturing-related R&amp;amp;D is extremely broad in scope, the
following examples of research topics may be of interest but are not
meant to be exhaustive.\n\n\t\n\t\tFlexible computer-assisted integrated
 manufacturing equipment and intelligent processing equipment adaptable

artificial tissues, electronic sensors and electrical
stimulators.\n\t\n\t\tTechnology for the production of natural products
derived from plant, animal, and microbial sources, such as antibiotics,
anticancer drugs, and other therapeutic agents, and useful synthetic
starting materials.\n\t\n\t\tTechnology for the production and isolation

external magnetic manipulation.\n\t\n\t\tTechnology for manufacture of
medical device power sources, such as high energy density, long
life-time batteries, solar cells, and fuel cells.\n\t\n\t\tTechnology
for the fabrication of medical care instruments and devices such as
minimally invasive and magnetic field tolerant surgical instruments,
orthopedic implants, prostheses, and enabling devices for the injured

gallbladder disease $6 billion.\n\n\tLiver and biliary diseases can be
caused by infectious agents, inherited defects, metabolic disturbances,
alcohol, toxins and environmental toxicants. The most common causes of
liver diseases are chronic hepatitis C, alcohol liver disease,
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic hepatitis B, autoimmune liver
diseases and drug-induced liver diseases. Many of these conditions can
be prevented or treated, but if not, they can lead to progressive liver
injury, liver fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis, portal hypertension,
end-stage liver disease and, in some instances, liver cancer. Currently,
 the only therapy for end-stage liver disease is liver transplantation.
More than 5000 liver transplants are done in the United States each year
 (including more than 500 in children). At least 17,000 persons are on a
 waiting list for liver transplantation and as many as 1500 die yearly
while waiting. The needs and challenges in liver disease research are
many.\n\n\tIn February 2005, the Digestive Diseases Interagency
Coordinating Committee of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
released a trans-NIH Action Plan for Liver Disease Research. The text of
 this Action Plan is available on the NIH website at:
http:\/\/liverplan.niddk.nih.gov.\n\n\tThe major purpose for development
 of the Action Plan was to identify areas of greatest scientific
opportunity to serve as a stimulus to progress and help direct NIH
research resources toward practical but important goals in the
prevention and control of liver and biliary diseases. The Action Plan
outlined a total of 214 research goals categorized into 16 areas of
liver disease research. Many of these research goals are appropriate for
 Small Business Innovative Research Grants and represent excellent
opportunities for translational research that could be conducted by a
small business with expertise and interest in biomedical research. This
announcement summarizes these opportunities and defines the interest of
the sponsoring Institutes and Centers in funding such
research.\n\n\tSummary of Priority Areas\n\n\tThe objective of this FOA
is to encourage and enable scientists at small businesses to develop and
 evaluate new technologies, drugs, devices, and approaches to diagnosis,
 management, and prevention of liver disease. Development of new
technologies as well as application of existing technologies may be
proposed. Studies may include use of animal models or human participants
 or both. If appropriate, plans for manufacturing and clinical
evaluation of developed technologies, drugs, devices and innovative
approaches should be included in the application. However, clinical
trials beyond Phase I studies will not be considered appropriate to this
 announcement.\n\n\tAppropriate topics for development and validation
under this FOA include, but are not limited to, the following which are
categorized into four major areas and which incorporate research goals
from the Action Plan for Liver Disease Research:\n\n\tDiagnostic Assays.
 A specific diagnosis can be made in most liver diseases but may require
 specialized testing or an invasive procedure. In some instances,
diagnostic assays are not generally available and may lead to delay or
mistakes in diagnosis. More accurate, commercially available tests are
needed for several liver diseases and conditions.\n\n\t\n\t\tSimple
screening assay for Wilson disease that might be applied to newborns
and\/or adolescents and adults with this disease.\n\t\n\t\tNon-invasive
means of assessing copper or iron content of the
liver.\n\t\n\t\tCommercially appropriate molecular tests for diagnosis
of the forms of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (caused by
 mutations in FIC1, BSEP or MDR3).\n\t\n\t\tAccurate and reproducible
diagnostic test for acetaminophen toxicity and alcoholic liver
disease.\n\n\n\tBiomarkers and Imaging Techniques. Biomarkers and more
sensitive imaging techniques may allow for non-invasive means of
assessing the liver and obviate the need for liver biopsy in diagnosis,
staging and grading of liver diseases.\n\n\t\n\t\tNon-invasive
biomarkers and imaging methods for liver fibrosis that accurately
reflect the stage of liver disease and can detect mild to moderate
degrees of fibrosis before the onset of cirrhosis. Biomarkers could be
individual tests on serum or urine or a combination of tests that might
be applied in an algorithm to assess degree of
fibrosis.\n\t\n\t\tMolecular signatures of major forms of hepatotoxicity
 for diagnostic use during genomic, proteomic and\/or metabolomic
technologies.\n\t\n\t\tNon-invasive imaging techniques for visualization
 of the biliary tree for architecture, motility, inflammation and
cancer.\n\t\n\t\tNon-invasive biomarkers or imaging techniques for
inflammation and injury in the liver that accurately reflect the
activity of liver disease and thus might be used to assess the need for
therapy or the adequacy of ongoing therapy.\n\t\n\t\tNon-invasive
biomarkers or imaging methods for the degree of fat in the liver that
provide a reliable quantification of steatosis. Biomarkers that can
reliably separate simple fat (steatosis) from fat accompanied by liver
injury (steatohepatitis) as well as distinguish fat accumulation due to
alcoholic and nonalcoholic causes are particularly
needed.\n\t\n\t\tNon-invasive biomarkers and imaging methods for
assessment of liver regeneration that can be applied to living donor
liver transplantation to both donor and recipients or to patients with
severe acute liver injury such as to provide a reliable assessment of
the likelihood of recovery and help in the decision to attempt liver
transplantation.\n\t\n\t\tNon-invasive biomarkers for assessment of
immune tolerance or adequacy of immune suppression that could be applied
 to patients after liver transplantation to guide the dose of
immunosuppressive therapies and whether therapy can be safely
withdrawal. Biomarkers for adequacy of immune suppression and tolerance
are also needed in management of autoimmune liver disease to guide dose
of prednisone or other immune suppressive agents and the possibility of
drug withdrawal.\n\t\n\t\tNon-invasive biomarkers and imaging techniques
 for early and reliable detection of hepatocellular carcinoma and
cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with cirrhosis or advanced chronic liver
disease are at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma and simple, but
reliable, serum or urine screening tests are needed to identify liver
cancer at an early stage while better imaging techniques are needed to
reliably separate benign, regenerating nodules from cancer. Similarly,
in patients with chronic biliary disease such as sclerosing cholangitis
or intrahepatic gallstones are at high risk for development of
cholangiocarcinoma, and serum or urine assays for early detection and
imaging tests for reliable identification of this tumor are greatly
needed.\n\t\n\t\tNon-invasive biomarkers for hepatotoxicity due to
medications, herbals, environmental chemicals or nutritional
supplements. Currently, serum aminotransferase levels are used to
monitor or assess liver toxicity from medications, but some elevations
in these liver-associated serum enzymes occur commonly but are
self-limited and do not signal significant liver injury. More reliable
markers for significant liver injury that might be combined with serum
aminotransferase levels are needed.\n\t\n\t\tNon-invasive biomarkers of
exposure to specific environmental chemicals that cause liver toxicity
that could be used to predict future onset of hepatotoxicity and to be
able to distinguish hepatotoxicity from transient adaptive enzyme
elevations.\n\t\n\t\tDetermination of individual liver metabolizing
enzyme SNP profiles in animals and humans that could be used to assess
sensitivity to specific drugs and environmental
exposures.\n\n\n\tPharmacotherapy. Safer and more effective
disease-specific as well as non-specific therapies for liver disease are
 needed. Understanding of pathways of liver cell injury, repair, and
regeneration are likely to lead to new and innovative approaches to
treat liver diseases.\n\n\t\n\t\tDrugs, biologics, complementary and
alternative modalities or molecular therapies that inhibit liver cell
injury nonspecifically through inhibition of necrosis or
apoptosis.\n\t\n\t\tDrugs, biologics, complementary and alternative
modalities or molecular therapies that safely promote regeneration,
particularly in the situation of living donor liver
transplantation\n\t\n\t\tDrugs, biologics, complementary and alternative
 modalities or molecular therapies that inhibit fibrosis or promote
fibrolysis in chronic liver diseases.\n\t\n\t\tDrugs, biologics,
complementary and alternative modalities or molecular therapies that
provide liver cell cytoprotection and might be appropriate for therapy
of hepatotoxicity or chronic hepatitis.\n\t\n\t\tDrugs, biologics,
complementary and alternative modalities or molecular therapies that
ameliorate itching in chronic liver disease through interruption of the
pathways that lead to pruritus.\n\t\n\t\tDrugs, biologics, complementary
 and alternative modalities or molecular therapies that reduce portal
pressure in different stages of the development of cirrhosis and portal
hypertension.\n\t\n\t\tDrugs, biologics, complementary and alternative
modalities or molecular therapies for the effective noncytotoxic therapy
 for hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\t\n\t\tDrugs, biologics, complementary
and alternative modalities or molecular therapies that inhibit fat
accumulation in the liver.\n\t\n\t\tDrugs, biologics, complementary and
alternative modalities or molecular therapies that inhibit recruitment
of inflammatory cells in the liver.\n\t\n\t\tImprovement in current
therapy for acute crisis of the hepatic porphyrias.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment
 of small molecule therapeutics for viral hepatitis B, C, and D that are
 also effective in the post liver transplant period. \n\t\n\t\tDietary
supplementsfor the therapy of alcohol related liver diseases through the
 NIAAA such assilymarin, s-adenosylmethionine, betaine, folate, and
zinc.\n\n\n\tGene Therapy. Gene therapy holds enormous promise for
therapy and potential cure of many inherited as well as acquired liver
diseases. Advances in gene therapy could well replace liver
transplantation for several liver diseases.\n\n\t\n\t\tBetter and safer
vectors for gene therapy of liver diseases.\n\t\n\t\tMeans of improving
homing of vectors to the liver.\n\t\n\t\tImproved techniques of gene
delivery and cell transplantation.\n\n\n\tLiver Assist Devices.
Currently there are no means of providing support to liver function in
the face of liver failure or after major hepatectomy. Liver assist
devices could be life-saving as a bridge to liver transplantation (while
 awaiting an appropriate donor liver) in a patient with primary graft
non-function or acute liver failure or while awaiting the normal
processes of regeneration to occur in acute liver failure or delayed
regeneration after partial hepatectomy.\n\n\t\n\t\tDevelop techniques
for culture of primary hepatocytes in large volumes with sustained
functions.\n\t\n\t\tDevelop artificial hepatic assist device using
either primary human hepatocytes, primary mammalian hepatocytes,
transformed human hepatocytes or continuous liver cell lines. \n\n",

opportunity is to solicit Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
grant applications (Phase I [R43] and Phase II [R44, both new and
renewal applications]) that are focused on specific Investigational New
Drug\/Investigational Device Exemption (IND\/IDE) enabling product
development activities for radiological\/nuclear medical countermeasures
 leading to IND or IDE submission packages to the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). This FOA will support non-clinical and
pre-clinical IND\/IDE-enabling activities that include efficacy studies
to optimize formulation, dose, and dose scheduling; statistically valid
developmental efficacy studies; GLP-pilot efficacy studies to inform the
 design of GLP pivotal efficacy study protocols; and to conduct drug
product stability studies, drug product current Good Manufacturing
Practice (cGMP) manufacturing scale-up, Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)
toxicology and pharmacology safety studies, pharmacokinetic and
metabolism studies, development of GLP analytical methods for efficacy
studies and product characterization, and completion of IND or IDE
packages for FDA submission. These product development efforts will
advance the new medical countermeasures towards Phase I clinical trial
safety studies, GLP animal model pivotal efficacy studies, and FDA
licensure.\n\n\tGLP animal model pivotal efficacy studies are NOT
supported by this FOA.\n\n\tPhase I clinical safety trials are NOT
supported by this FOA. Applicants interested in carrying out Phase I
clinical trials must submit a separate application and are encouraged to
 consult the NIAID Clinical Trial Planning (R34) Grants program
(http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/pa-files\/PAR-05-112.html).\n\n\tBackground
 and Research Objectives\n\n\tVery few medical products exist that have
been shown to counter the acute and long-term injuries that can result
from a nuclear or radiological accident or attack. The threat of attack
has grown in recent years, with increased activity of global terrorist
organizations and a rise in illicit trafficking of radioactive
materials. In July 2004, the President signed Project BioShield into law

(http:\/\/frwebgate.access.gpo.gov\/cgi-bin\/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;amp;docid=f:publ090.108.pdf).
 This is a Federal effort to develop and make available drugs and
vaccines to protect against terrorist-mediated chemical, biological, or
radiological\/nuclear exposure. Project BioShield has initiated several
activities directed at the development, licensure and stockpiling of
FDA-approved countermeasures for radiological and nuclear injury. The
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National
Institutes of Health (NIH) was given the responsibility by the
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to identify, characterize
 and develop new medical countermeasure products against radiological
and nuclear attacks that may cause a public health emergency. \n\n\tIn
2005, the NIH published a Strategic Plan and Research Agenda for Medical
 Countermeasures against Radiological and Nuclear Threats
(http:\/\/www3.niaid.nih.gov\/about\/overview\/planningPriorities\/RadNuc_StrategicPlan.pdf).
 This agenda includes focused product development, including medical
countermeasures for mitigation and treatment of acute radiation
syndromes (ARS), as well as development of radionuclide decorporation
agents, and biodosimetry devices. Several NIAID-supported contract and
grants programs
(http:\/\/www3.niaid.nih.gov\/research\/topics\/radnuc\/default.htm)
have been established to initiate research and product development
efforts. The grant programs established eight Centers for Medical
Countermeasure against Radiation (CMCRs) for research on mitigation and
treatment of acute radiation syndromes (ARS), new programs to develop
novel radionuclide decorporation agents, and programs to identify and
evaluate biodosimetry techniques and devices. Other grant programs
supporting the research and development of medical countermeasures
against specific radiation injuries in tissues, such as hematopoietic,
gastrointestinal, cutaneous, lung, and combined injuries, have been
implemented. In addition, contract programs have identified and
evaluated medical countermeasures for mitigation and treatment of ARS
and have identified and evaluated new forms of
diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA) with significantly increased oral
bioavailability. Continued successful development of medical
countermeasures, ARS mitigators or treatments, radionuclide
decorporation agents, and biodosimetry techniques and devices will fill
an important need for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).\n\n\tThe
NIAID encourages the development of 1) effective therapeutic products to
 mitigate and\/or treat short-term and long-term or delayed effects of
radiation exposures, 2) radionuclide decorporation agents to eliminate
internal contamination, and 3) biodosimetry devices and methods to
measure external or internal radiation dose. The spectrum of research
and development activities may include proof of principle studies,
preclinical efficacy work, statistically valid developmental efficacy
studies, GLP-pilot studies to inform the design of GLP pivotal efficacy
study protocols, non-clinical determination of safety, toxicology and
metabolism, formulation development as well as determination of dose and
 dose scheduling, cGMP manufacturing scale-up and drug product stability
 studies, development of GLP analytical methods for efficacy studies,
product characterization, and completion of IND or IDE packages for FDA
submission. These activities will support the development, preparation
and submission of IND and IDE for eventual FDA licensure, including
studies leading up to Phase I clinical trial safety studies and GLP
animal model pivotal efficacy studies. This FOA, however, will NOT
support Phase I clinical trials or GLP animal model pivotal efficacy
studies.\n\n\tThe priority areas of product development interests from
proof of principle to submission of IND\/IDE include but are not limited
 to the following examples:\n\n\t\n\t\tMedical products and regimens
that mitigate and\/or treat radiation injury post-exposure (i.e.,
administration of first dose to start at least 24 hours after radiation
exposure), with emphasis on broad activity (i.e., multi-syndrome,
multi-tissue), ease of administration in an emergency scenario, safety,
and long shelf-life;\n\t\n\t\tRadionuclide decorporation agents that
facilitate elimination of a range of radionuclides from the body or
blocking agents that prevent the absorption of radionuclides in the
body;\n\t\n\t\tMinimally invasive biodosimetry devices useful for
emergency triage that can rapidly and accurately distinguish individuals
 who need treatment from those who do not, and that can identify and
measure internal and external exposure; and\n\t\n\t\tNew medical product
 formulations that can be easily administered to civilian populations
including special populations (e.g., infants, children, elderly, and the
 immunocompromised) in emergency situations.\n\n\n\tThe overall goal of
this program is the rapid development of safe and effective
radiological\/nuclear medical countermeasures for clinical use under
emergency situations.\n\n\tGuidance for the approval of decorporation
agents to treat internal radionuclide contamination has been provided by
 the FDA and is available at
http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/cder\/guidance\/6983fnl.htm.\n\n\tStudies in
animal models will be required to demonstrate efficacy of the medical
countermeasure products. It is anticipated that in most cases licensure
or approval of proposed medical countermeasures will occur in accordance
 with the FDA Animal Rule (see 21 CFR 314.600 Subpart I for drug
products and 21 CFR 601.90 Subpart H for biologic products

        "description": "\n\tBackground\n\n\tAn emerging area of
scientific opportunity is the design and use of probes to study
structure and function at the molecular and subcellular level in living
cells. Approaches and tools such as labels that attach to specific
peptide or nucleotide moieties, Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer,
Green Fluorescent Protein (and mutant color variants), and
genetically-engineered voltage or ion-sensitive fluorophores are making
it possible to begin to visualize not only the distribution of molecular
 species in cells, but the manner in which they interact. Research and
development of these, and other such technologies, hold the promise of
providing scientists the capabilities to track the ebb and flow of
signal transduction cascades, protein-protein interactions,
protein-nucleotide interactions, movement of subcellular elements within
 cells, and other dynamic events. And, it appears that as such tools are
 elaborated and further studied, they will permit such observations to
be quantitative and made in real time. Finally, bioengineering
individual probes that are detectable by multiple modalities, (e.g.,
electron microscopy, fluorescent microscopy and fluorescent
spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging) would add great value by
allowing independent lines of scientific inquiry to converge on the same
 cellular process and\/or structure as indicated by the multimodal
probe. This area of science and technology is poised for major advances,
 and these advances would bring new levels of understanding of the
molecular physiology of nervous system cells, as well as the manner in
which this physiology is affected by disease, pharmacologic agents,

        "topic_name": "Development of Biomarkers for Mental Health
Research and Clinical Use ",
        "description": "\n\tBackground\n\n\tBiomarkers are objective,
measurable biochemical, genetic, or other biological indicators of a
physiological or disease process. While some individual biomarkers are
useful in biomedicine, complex conditions, such as mental illness, might
 benefit from constellations of several different biomarkers being used
in concert. Whether used alone or in conjunction with others, biomarkers
 could facilitate definitive diagnosis of mental disorders in
individuals, assess the susceptibility of individuals to a particular
disorder, indicate changes in the severity of a disorder, and show the
response of a disorder to a given treatment. Such information would have
 clear and significant clinical benefit, and are urgently needed.
\n\n\tThe National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) supports research
on mental disorders including schizophrenia, depression, bipolar
disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders,
eating disorders, Tourettes syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder,
autism spectrum disorders, AIDS dementia complex, etc. Some disorders
appear as a broad spectrum where signs and symptoms vary enormously but
yet collectively represent one general disorder (e.g., autism spectrum
disorders). In other instances, a particular symptom may appear across a
 variety of mental disorders (e.g., cognitive impairment) or represent
an exaggeration of a dimension seen in healthy individuals (e.g.,
depressed mood). It is possible that biomarkers could aid clinicians in
categorizing particular signs and symptoms so that a spectrum disorder
could be broken down into well-defined subcategories, allowing
differential analysis or treatment. Biomarkers could also be used to
clarify boundaries between health and illness, and could be used in
basic research to map the variability of a marker across healthy
populations. \n\n\tGoal\n\n\tThe goal of this initiative is to support
small businesses to develop innovative biomarker technologies, with
commercial potential, for clinical and\/or basic research utility, with
the long term, but clear, objective of their being used in humans to
assess mental function and dysfunction as related to mental illness.
\n\n\tResearch Activities and Examples \n\n\tThere are many approaches a
 company could take to commercialize a biomarker. Examples of types of
products include: in house services, heterogeneous databases that
include biomarker data combined with behavioral, clinical or other
functional data, toolkits that enable other researchers to use the
biomarker with appropriate hardware, software, or wetware needed to
carry out the study, development of a novel detection system for
measuring a particular biomarker, development of a marketable protocol
for measuring a biomarker, novel technologies that enable new biomarkers
 to be identified, etc. Identifying, parameterizing, optimizing and
validating the use of particular biomarkers with regard to their
relationship to brain or behavioral function are among the research
activities encouraged by this program announcement. Projects limited to
basic research on biomarkers with no clear path to developing these for
use in humans are not encouraged by this program announcement (though
early stage research in animal models is appropriate).\n\n\tThe NIMH is
specifically interested in clinically applied biomarkers as well as
those useful in basic brain or behavioral research. In all cases the
biomarker should be effective on an individual basis, rather than from
pooled individuals. Also, biomarkers appropriate for this program
announcement may be intended to be used with behavioral measures, but
behavioral measures alone are not considered biomarkers here. Biomarkers
 could be noninvasively obtained (e.g., using optical or magnetic
resonance imaging, etc.) or obtained with minimal invasiveness (e.g.,
using genetic, protein or metabolic signatures, physiological measures,
etc.). NIMH is interested in biomarkers that are useful across the
lifespan as well as those that are useful for particular age groups
(e.g. infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood,
elderly).\n\n\tSpecific examples of clinical applications include:
reliable and stable biomarkers that can identify at-risk individuals
prior to disease onset, biological and behavioral indicators or
predictors of treatment response, measures of disease progression,
measures to identify dose ranges prior to clinical studies, preclinical
or clinical efficacy testing, toxicity measures for drug development,
defining patients to enroll in the clinical study, identifying CNS
abnormalities, etc. It is important to note that these examples are
merely illustrative and are not meant to limit the scope of appropriate
clinical applications.\n\n\tSpecific examples of basic research
applications: biomarkers that enable refined assessment of normal and
atypical infant, child and adolescent brain development and brain
function, biomarkers for assessing changes in specific mental functions
over the lifespan, etc. Either human subjects or relevant animal models
would be appropriate to use in basic research applications. It is
important to note that these examples are merely illustrative and are
not meant to limit the scope of appropriate basic research
applications.\n\n\tNIMH-Wide Interest \n\n\tAll of the divisions at NIMH
 have interests in biomarker development. Therefore, Dr. Margaret Grabb
will be an initial point of contact for the institute and will refer
potential applicants to the most appropriate program contact in the most
 appropriate division.\n\n\tNCCAM is also inteerested in applications
proposing studies on stress.\n\n\tPossibility for SBIR Type 2 (Renewal)
Phase II Competing Renewal Support\n\n\tIf a company is proposing to
develop biomarkers as diagnostic tools, and requires Federal Regulatory
Approval prior to commercialization, the company may be eligible for a
one time SBIR Phase II Competing Renewal Award after receiving a
previous Phase II award. Potential applicants should contact Dr.
Margaret Grabb (see Section VII), and she will refer the company to the
appropriate division for additional information in this
regard.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n",

Technologies to Reduce Health Disparities",
        "description": "\n\tPurpose\n\n\tThe purpose of this funding
opportunity is to reduce health disparities through the development and
translation of appropriate medical technologies.&amp;nbsp; The NIH
defines health disparities as differences in the incidence, prevalence,
morbidity, mortality, and burden of diseases and other adverse health
outcomes that exist among specific population groups.&amp;nbsp; These
population groups are African Americans, American Indians, Alaska
Natives, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and
other Pacific Islanders, subpopulations of all of these racial\/ethnic
groups, socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, and medically
underserved populations including individuals residing in rural and
urban areas.&amp;nbsp; Appropriate medical technologies must have the
following basic characteristics: effective, affordable, culturally
acceptable, and easily accessible to those who need them.&amp;nbsp;
Responsive grant applications must, during Phase I and Phase II, involve
 a formal collaboration with a healthcare provider or other healthcare
organization serving a health disparity population.&amp;nbsp; This
announcement supports applications to develop medical devices, imaging
systems, and other technologies that adequately address the healthcare
needs of health disparity populations.&amp;nbsp; It is expected that
responsive grant applications will result in advances in medical
technologies that will be invaluable in reducing health disparities
within and across the priority areas of cardiovascular disease, stroke,
cancer, diabetes, HIV\/AIDS, infant mortality, mental health, and
obesity, as well as lung, liver, and kidney diseases, psoriasis,
scleroderma, and other diseases, illnesses, and conditions of public
health importance.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tMedical and scientific advances
have introduced new opportunities for the continued improvement of
health for all Americans. However, in spite of notable improvements
gained as a result of the technological advancement, there continues to
be an alarming disproportionate burden of illness among minority and
other health disparity populations.&amp;nbsp; Overcoming persistent
disparities in healthcare access and health outcomes remains a foremost
challenge. To meet this challenge, the NIH is committed to supporting a
wide range of research, aimed at the development of innovative
diagnostics, treatments, and preventative strategies to reduce, and
eventually eliminate, health disparities.\n\n\tResearch Objectives and
Scope\n\n\tThe primary objective of this funding opportunity is to
support the translation of medical technologies, new or existing, that
can have a significant impact on healthcare access and health outcomes
for health disparity populations.&amp;nbsp; Small business concerns
(SBCs) are invited to submit grant applications proposing to develop and
 deliver appropriate technologies to health disparity
populations.&amp;nbsp; Responsive applications, during Phase I and Phase
 II, must involve collaborations with underserved populations and\/or
collaborations with clinics in an underserved community. A requisite
component of the research plan is a description of the healthcare
requirements and needs of the population and the existing barriers to
adequate healthcare delivery. Several of these barriers have been
identified and are described below. Applications submitted to this
funding opportunity must address one or more of these barriers in
developing technologies that will impact health
disparities:\n\n\t\n\t\tPhysical Barriers&amp;mdash;factors such as
proximity to healthcare facilities and transportation may limit access
to healthcare\n\t\n\t\tKnowledge Barriers&amp;mdash;health literacy and
language barriers can inhibit healthcare delivery, as well as a lack of
patient information for the healthcare provider\n\t\n\t\tInfrastructure
Barriers&amp;mdash;rural hospitals and community health centers may not
have the same resources and expertise of large hospitals, and may not be
 able to afford advanced medical technologies\n\t\n\t\tEconomic
Barriers&amp;mdash;lack of insurance coverage or financial resources may
 also contribute to disparities in healthcare access\n\t\n\t\tCultural
Barriers&amp;mdash;religious beliefs and social customs often deter
certain populations from seeking healthcare\n\n\n\tAppropriate
technologies may be new and innovative, or they may be existing
technologies that have been redesigned based on the needs of a specific
health disparity population.&amp;nbsp; Appropriate technologies have
been defined as effective, affordable, culturally acceptable, and
deliverable to those who need them. To be effective, a technology must
provide an improvement over the current quality of care for a health
disparity population by overcoming one or more of the barriers. The
technology must also be low-cost, so as to be affordable to the local
hospital, community health center, primary care physician, or individual
 patient in need.&amp;nbsp; For a medical technology to be adopted by a
health disparity population, the technology development must be amenable
 to the population&amp;rsquo;s cultural beliefs and social
customs.&amp;nbsp; Acceptance of the technology by the population is
critical to the successful delivery of quality healthcare.&amp;nbsp; To
be physically delivered to those in need, a technology must be developed
 within the specifications of the operating environment of the
end-user.&amp;nbsp; The technology must be able to function given the
existing resources and expertise within health disparity populations.
Keeping in mind the barriers that contribute to health disparities, a
non-inclusive list of appropriate medical technologies that might
achieve the objectives of this initiative may be found
below:\n\n\t\n\t\tTelehealth technologies for remote diagnosis and
monitoring\n\t\n\t\tSensors for point-of-care diagnosis\n\t\n\t\tDevices
 for in-home monitoring\n\t\n\t\tMobile, portable diagnostic and
therapeutic systems\n\t\n\t\tDevices which integrate diagnosis and
treatment\n\t\n\t\tDiagnostics or treatments that do not require special
 training\n\t\n\t\tDevices that can operate in low-resource
environments\n\t\n\t\tNon-invasive technologies for diagnosis and
treatment\n\t\n\t\tIntegrated, automated system to assess or monitor a
specific condition\n\n\n\tSome examples include, but are not limited
to\n\n\t\n\t\tInexpensive diabetic test strip and\/or blood sugar
monitoring.&amp;nbsp; With the growing obesity epidemic and the growing
incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes, health disparity
communities struggle with diabetes and its many sequelae (#1 cause of
blindness, dialysis, and amputations).\n\t\n\t\tUse of currently
available basic technology (e.g. phone lines, televisions with remote
controls, cellphones, weight scales, diabetic glucometers, thermometers)
 within underserved settings to promote self-management and patient
education, increase patient-clinician communication and surveillance of
chronic disease conditions.\n\t\n\t\tTelemedicine to improve access to
specialty care which would normally not be accessible because of high
cost and transportation.&amp;nbsp; This would also link up academic
tertiary-oriented health centers with community-based primary care
homes.\n\t\n\t\tImproved early detection (via saliva testing, breath
testing, blood testing) of diseases where there are significant health
disparities.\n\t\n\t\tLow-cost portable imaging for prevention and early
 detection of conditions where there are significant health disparities
(e.g. breast cancer screening and portable retinal imaging).\n\n\n\tThe
NIAMS has specific interest in projects developing or translating
technologies that reduce health disparities in areas of arthritis,
musculoskeletal and skin diseases, conditions, and injuries (see

        "description": "\n\tThe SBIR program, as established by law, is
intended to meet the following goals: stimulate technological innovation
 in the private sector; strengthen the role of small business in meeting
 Federal research or research and development (R\/R&amp;amp;D) needs;
increase the commercial application of Federally-supported research
results; foster and encourage participation by socially and economically
 disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned business concerns
 in the SBIR program; and improve the return on investment from
Federally-funded research for economic and social benefits to the
Nation.\n\n\tThe SBIR program is structured in three phases, the first
two of which are supported using SBIR funds. The objective of Phase I is
 to establish the technical\/scientific merit and feasibility of the
proposed R\/R&amp;amp;D efforts. The objective of Phase II is to
continue the research or R&amp;amp;D efforts initiated in Phase I. An
objective of the SBIR program is to increase private sector
commercialization of innovations derived from Federal R\/R&amp;amp;D.
The objective of Phase III, where appropriate, is for the SBC to pursue
with non-SBIR funds (either Federal or non-Federal) the
commercialization objectives resulting from the results of the
R\/R&amp;amp;D funded in Phases I and II. &amp;nbsp;In some Federal
agencies, Phase III may involve follow-on, non-SBIR funded R&amp;amp;D,
or production contracts for products or processes intended for use by
the U.S. Government.\n\n\tThe competition for SBIR Phase I and Phase II
awards satisfies the competition requirement of the Armed Services
Procurement Act, the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act,
and the Competition in Contracting Act. Therefore, an agency that wishes
 to fund an SBIR Phase III project is not required to conduct another
competition in order to satisfy those statutory provisions. As a result,
 in conducting actions relative to a Phase III SBIR award, it is
sufficient to state for purposes of a Justification and Approval
pursuant to FAR 6.302-5 that the project is a SBIR Phase III award that
is derived from, extends, or logically concludes efforts performed under
 prior SBIR funding agreements and is authorized under 10 U.S.C.
2304(b)(2) or 41 U.S.C. 253(b)(2).\n\n\tThis Funding Opportunity
Announcement (FOA) issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), and the Administration for Children and Families
(ACF) invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to
submit Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I, Phase II,
Fast-Track (NIH only), and Phase II Competing Renewal (NIH only) grant
applications.\n\n\tThe PHS 2011-2 SBIR\/STTR Program Descriptions and
Research Topics for NIH, CDC, FDA, and ACF represent scientific program
areas that may be of interest to applicant SBCs in the development of
projects that have potential for commercialization. Small business
concerns that have the research capabilities and technological expertise
 to contribute to the R&amp;amp;D mission(s) of the NIH, CDC, FDA, or
ACF awarding components identified in this FOA are encouraged to submit
SBIR grant applications in these areas. SBIR grant applications will
also be accepted and considered in any area within the mission of the
Components of Participating Organizations listed for this FOA. In
addition to the general research areas described above some NIH awarding
 components have identified additional, specific SBIR funding
opportunities of potential interest to SBCs. See the NIH Special
Announcements for Small Business Research
Opportunities.&amp;nbsp;Applicants are not required to identify a
potential awarding component prior to submission of the application, but
 may request one in a cover letter. Staff within the NIH&amp;rsquo;s
Center for Scientific Review (CSR) office, the single receiving point
for all NIH, FDA, CDC, and ACF grant applications, will assign all
applications to the most appropriate Institute\/Center (IC) based on
their mission and the science proposed.\n\n\tSome of the NIH ICs offer
the opportunity to submit Phase II Competing Renewal applications that
will provide additional funding for Phase II SBIR projects. These
renewals are often offered for those projects that require regulatory
approval for the product or service being developed or to support
complex instrumentation, clinical research tools, and behavioral
interventions\/treatments. For those ICs that included these
opportunities in the PHS 2011-2 SBIR\/STTR Program Descriptions and
Research Topics for NIH, CDC, FDA, and ACF, applications will be
accepted through this Parent SBIR FOA. All others must be submitted in
response to the specific FOA released by the IC. See the NIH Special

        "description": "\n\t\n\tTools for germplasm cryopreservation
have become increasingly important in enabling repositories to meet the
needs for establishing banks of animal germplasm for current and future
research needs. This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) solicits
applications from SBCs for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
projects that propose innovative research in the areas of animal
germplasm cryopreservation methods, reagents, equipment, biosecurity,
and the detection of disease, including the vertical transmission of
disease.\n\n\tThe ability to produce transgenic, knockout, and mutant
stocks has provided biomedical researchers with many useful animal
models for the study of human diseases. However, the requirements to
maintain these and other strains as live animals can overwhelm the
capacity of even the largest stock centers. The number of strains is so
great that it has become impossible in terms of cost, space, and
manpower to maintain more than a fraction of them as breeding colonies.
Consequently, an increasing proportion of animals are being maintained
by cryopreservation of their germplasm. However, ongoing and planned
large scale mutant and screening projects have increased the need for
efficient and efficacious technologies that can address the current and
future needs of repositories; namely, to preserve animal germplasm and
more efficiently manage and distribute animals and related biological
materials.\n\n\tIn April 2007, a NIH workshop entitled, Achieving High
Throughput Repositories for Biomedical Germplasm Preservation
(Cryopreservation Workshop report) was held to assess the need for
cryopreservation of the large numbers of genetically-engineered animals
from multiple species that have been created, or will be created, as a
result of NIH Roadmap and Trans-NIH initiatives, such as the Knockout
Mouse Project, Target-Selected Mutagenesis in Zebrafish, and Neuromouse
Project. At that meeting, the status of germplasm cryopreservation and
drying technologies was assessed for animal models for translational
research. A major recommendation at that meeting is to encourage the
development of high-throughput and scaleable technologies for germplasm
collection, evaluation, processing and cryopreservation to shorten and
refine the processes to meet the research community needs for
high-quality animal germplasm preservation.\n\n\tTo help address this
recommendation, the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)
invites applications from SBCs for Small Business Innovative Research
(SBIR) to develop tools to enhance cryopreservation technologies for the
 preservation of, and secure long-term maintenance of sperm, embryos,
oocytes, and other forms of laboratory animal germplasm. Examples of
such research may include but are not limited to: 1) new storage devices
 that enhance long-term viability; 2) specialized reagents to improve
cryopreservation, vitrification and drying of germplasm; 3) reagents to
test for germplasm viability; 4) machinery to reduce the variability of
the quality of sperm, embryos and oocytes during collection, processing,
 storage and reanimation; 5) research tools to reduce or eliminate the
large individual male-to-male variability with respect to the quality of
 collected sperm and survival following cryopreservation; and 6)
improved biosecurity tools for the screening, diagnosis and elimination
of selected diseases of laboratory animals, including vertical and
horizontal transmission. The target species for this FOA include, but
are not limited to, rodents, nonhuman primates, and aquatic models used
in biomedical research. Applications proposing research projects
involving predominantly agricultural or farm animals will be considered
lower priority\n\t\n\tSee Section VIII, Other Information - Required

        "description": "\n\tFor details, please refer to the
solicitation details located at FedBizOpps website.\n\n\tIn the event of
 a foreign animal disease (FAD) outbreak in the United States, such as
highly pathogenic avian influenza or Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD),
export markets will be severely impacted until the United States can
regain international status as free from the disease.&amp;nbsp; Freedom
is achieved by containing the outbreak, preventing disease spread, and
eliminating the pathogen.&amp;nbsp; A primary mode of spreading disease
is by personnel and vehicles contacting contaminated material, including
 infected livestock, soil or animal bedding, then tracking the pathogen
to another location on shoes, clothing, and vehicle surfaces.&amp;nbsp;
Therefore, it is critically important that personnel and vehicles be
disinfected prior to moving during an outbreak so the outbreak can be
controlled as quickly as possible.&amp;nbsp; However, if the
disinfection process is too cumbersome, compliance may be reduced,
thereby increasing risk.\n\n\tOne of the major concerns during an
outbreak is economic impact, which not only arises from lost export
markets, but also from the cost of controlling the outbreak
itself.&amp;nbsp; Any operation with multiple steps requiring
significant labor, supplies and equipment, such as cleaning and
disinfection, can greatly increase the cost of the response, and costs
escalate the longer the outbreak continues.&amp;nbsp; Therefore,
strategies to minimize labor costs while increasing speed of such an
operation can significantly reduce outbreak control time and
expenses.&amp;nbsp; Automated vehicle disinfection is one strategy that
can both drastically reduce labor costs and response time, while
facilitating outbreak control.&amp;nbsp; Recent FMD outbreak experiences
 in the United Kingdom and South Korea indicate that disinfecting
vehicles during cold weather conditions is extremely challenging if
disinfectant mixtures or disinfectant lines freeze.\n\n\tCommercial
car\/truck wash stations can meet the need for automation and
freeze-protection, but the stations are typically not located exactly
where needed, such as at the entrance to infected premises, and the
corrosiveness of some disinfectants may damage commercial
equipment.&amp;nbsp; Although there are portable, non-freezing truck
wash stations available commercially, the large automated ones are very
expensive and must be moved with a crane, which adds to response cost
and delays.&amp;nbsp; Overall, there is a general lack of ready-to-use
equipment for portable, temporary vehicle wash stations, which can be
readily acquired, deployed and used.\n\n\tTherefore, it is necessary to
develop portable automated vehicle wash stations that can be easily
shipped and installed in the field, either on farms or roadway
checkpoints.&amp;nbsp; The units should be:\n\n\t\n\t\tlight-weight
&amp;ndash; ideally unit can be transported on the back of a pick-up
truck, unloaded by 2 &amp;ndash; 4 people.&amp;nbsp; At a minimum, it
should be transportable in or on a vehicle readily available to state
and local emergency responders.\n\t\n\t\tcost-effective (designed to
minimize the cost of the unit to the maximum extent
possible);\n\t\n\t\t&amp;nbsp;rapidly assembled (set up by 2 &amp;ndash;
 4 people in less than 4 hours);\n\t\n\t\tsemi-permanent (operating for
days to months at a time); and\n\t\n\t\trugged enough for large volume
traffic.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\tThe units should be designed
to:&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\tclean at least a &amp;frac34; ton pick-up truck
 with design scalable to 18-wheeler;\n\t\n\t\taddress a wide-variety of
pathogens including viruses, bacteria and spore-formers, using
disinfectant solutions which may degrade some
material:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tacids, alcohols, aldehydes, alkalis,
biguanides, halogen compounds, oxidizing agents, phenols, and\/or
quaternary ammonium compounds may be used as
disinfectants,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\ta 4- to 6-log reduction in
microorganisms (per EPA guidance available at
http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/oppad001\/sciencepolicy.htm) is considered
disinfection.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tprevent freezing in cold weather
conditions:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tunit should be non-freezing to -25C
(-13F);\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tachieve complete vehicle treatment including
the undercarriage:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\theavily mud-caked vehicles
will likely be pre-treated, but the unit will have to clean some surface
 debris off the vehicles;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tpressure would be similar to
that used in commercial car washes.&amp;nbsp; It is assumed a vehicle
will be driven into the tunnel, the vehicle will be washed with
detergent, rinsed with water, disinfected followed by the required
contact time (usually 10 &amp;ndash; 30 minutes for common
disinfectants, depending on ambient temperature) and rinsed
again.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tcollect disinfectant
runoff:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tdisinfectant can be recycled if the
recycled disinfectant solution is as efficacious as the original
solution;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tdisposal of collected water to be handled by
others;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\trinse water must be collected and conveyed to
containers provided by others, or treated and recycled as part of
system.\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tIdeally, the units will be cost-effective,
user-friendly, have low emissions, conserve energy, and be
low-maintenance.&amp;nbsp; Some of the research and development
challenges of this concept include:&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\tEngineering a
collapsible, light-weight tunnel which delivers the optimal flow of
disinfectant chemicals to all surfaces of a vehicle, including the
undercarriage.&amp;nbsp; This involves materials research to
identify\/develop light-weight, flexible, yet rugged fabrics and tubing
which can withstand traffic, weather, and harsh chemicals under
pressure.&amp;nbsp; For example, bleach is known to degrade certain
rubber-like materials and citric acid could corrode metal components so
the tubing assembly must be resistant to damage from common
disinfectants.\n\t\n\t\tFactory-assembling or quickly field-assembling
system components with flexible but stable hinges or joints that can be
collapsed and erected manually, preferable by a single
person.\n\t\n\t\tDesigning the base of the unit to promote flow of
liquids to a single point for pumping to separate collection containers,
 regardless of the terrain of the premises.\n\t\n\t\tCombining the
components in a manner to maximize personnel safety during set-up,
operations, and dismantling; maximize cleaning and disinfection
efficiency and effectiveness; and minimize the need for operations and
maintenance labor.\n\n\n\tPHASE I: Develop a concept for a new
technology or modify an existing technology.&amp;nbsp; Demonstrate the
feasibility of the technology at the bench or pilot scale
level.\n\n\tPHASE II: Develop a fully functional prototype of the unit
and demonstrate it in the field.&amp;nbsp; Full functionality includes
the ability of the system to: 1) accommodate personnel and vehicles; 2)
contain and collect wash water; 3) pump washwater; 4) deliver detergent
and disinfectant solutions to a person or vehicle; 5) automatically
deliver disinfectant to all sides of a vehicle, including the
undercarriage, at sufficient pressure to ensure complete removal of
visible soil on vehicle surfaces including tires; and 6) protect the
disinfectant solution from freezing while achieving required contact
times.\n\n\tPHASE III: COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:Upon delivery and
demonstration of a prototype, the technology should be suitable for
manufacturing and sale in the commercial marketplace, with some minor
modifications acceptable.&amp;nbsp; The commercial units would be
available for purchase\/lease by governmental and\/or response agencies
who would use the units for deployment during an animal disease outbreak
 to assist the response and recovery effort and contain the
outbreak.&amp;nbsp; In the absence of an outbreak, the units can be used
 for routine biosecurity at production facilities to prevent an outbreak
 and facilitate continuity of a high-quality, plentiful, and low-cost
food supply.\n",

        "topic_name": "Moving Target Defense",
        "description": "\n\tFor details, please refer to the
solicitation details located at FedBizOpps website.\n\n\tIn the current
environment, our systems are built to operate in a relatively static
configuration. For example, addresses, names, software stacks, networks,
 and various configuration parameters remain relatively static over
relatively long periods of time. This static approach is a legacy of
information technology system design for simplicity in a time when
malicious exploitation of system vulnerabilities was not a
concern.\n\n\tIn order to be effective, adversaries must know a
particular vulnerability of a system. The longer the vulnerability of a
system exists, the more likely it is to be discovered and then
exploited. Many system vulnerabilities are published by researchers and
software vendors in order for system owners to patch those
vulnerabilities. A system that remains unpatched is vulnerable to
exploitation. Vulnerabilities that are not publicly disclosed are called
 zero-day vulnerabilities, and are known to a limited set of people.
Zero-day vulnerabilities present a large risk to system owners because
without knowledge of the vulnerability, system owners have no way to
patch it.\n\n\tIt is now clear that static systems present a substantial
 advantage to attackers. Attackers can observe the operation of key IT
systems over long periods of time and plan attacks at their leisure,
having mapped out an inventory of assets, vulnerabilities, and exploits.
 Additionally, attackers can anticipate likely responses and deploy
attacks that escalate in sophistication as defenders deploy better
defenses. Attackers can afford to invest significant resources in
developing attacks since the attacks can often be used repeatedly from
one system to another.\n\n\tThe magnitude of this problem suggests that
the information technology community needs a radically new approach for
IT system defense. To visualize the elements of the new environment,
observe that for attackers to exploit a system today, they must learn
about a vulnerability and hope that it is present long enough to
exploit. For defenders to defeat attacks today, they must develop a
signature of malware or attacks and hope it is static long enough to
block that attack. Malware writers develop mechanisms to rapidly change
malware in order to defeat detection mechanisms. We, as defenders,
should learn from this approach, and build systems that rapidly change,
never allowing the exploitation of a particular vulnerability to impair
the ability of a system to perform its mission\/function, or if
exploited once, not allowed to be exploitable again. If done correctly,
this &amp;ldquo;moving target&amp;quot; defense can present a formidable
 obstacle to attackers since attackers depend on knowing a
system&amp;#39;s vulnerabilities a priori.\n\n\tTherefore, a
game-changing approach to building self-defending systems can and must
be developed. Protecting systems (thus avoiding exposed vulnerabilities)
 to the greatest extent possible should still be the first goal. This
new approach is known as, &amp;quot;Moving Target Defense
(MTD).&amp;quot; An important benefit of moving target defense is to
decrease the known attack surface area of our systems to adversaries
while simultaneously shifting it; a key challenge of moving target
defense is to ensure that our systems remain dependable to their users
and maintainable by their owners. By making the attack surface of
software appear chaotic to adversaries, it forces them to significantly
increase the work effort to exploit vulnerabilities for every desired
target. For instance, by the time an adversary discovers a vulnerability
 in a service, the service will have changed its attack surface area so
that an-other exploit against that vulnerability will be ineffective.
The characteristics of a MTD system are dynamically changed in ways that
 are manageable by the defender yet make the attack space appear
unpredictable to the attacker. Moving target defense technology changes
the game by wresting the advantage from the attacker because it
eliminates the availability of constant or slowly-changing vulnerability
 windows that allow attackers to lie in wait and conduct useful
experiments on persistent vulnerabilities. This game-changing approach
challenges the traditional approach which councils that adding
complexity to our systems adds risk. Conversely, the complexity of
today&amp;rsquo;s compute platforms and analytic and control methods can
 now be used to frustrate our adversaries. The challenge is to
demonstrate that complexity is indeed a benefit and not a
liability.\n\n\tThe MTD area has its underpinnings in fundamental
research in the following supporting or component areas: virtualization,
 multi-core processing, new networking capabilities, systems management,
 and evolutionary resiliency and defense methods. The results of the
National Cyber Leap Year (NCLY) Summit (see References) categorized the
current needs into research areas for consideration as
follows:&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t(1) Characterize the vulnerability space and
understand the effect of system randomization on the ability to exploit
those vulnerabilities.\n\n\t(2) Understand the effect of randomization
of individual components on the behavior of complex systems, with
respect to both their resiliency and their ability to evade
threats.\n\n\t(3) Develop a control mechanism that can abstract the
complexity of MTD systems and enable sound, resilient systems
management.\n\n\t(4) Enable the adaptation of MTD mechanisms as the
understanding of system behavior matures and our threat
evolves.\n\n\tPHASE I: Demonstrate new methods, techniques, tools,
and\/or designs providing improved &amp;ldquo;moving target
defense&amp;rdquo; technologies using the component areas identified
above. Proofs-of-concept may include existing legacy products and tools,
 with new capabilities and\/or services that could be applied in
operational environments at either the individual system level or
network level or both.\n\n\tPHASE II: Develop and implementation
operationally ready tools, methods, mechanisms, and\/or services
providing &amp;ldquo;moving target defense&amp;rdquo; capabilities with
initial solution capable of being demonstrated in operational systems
and\/or network environments.\n\n\tPHASE III: COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:
The final developed &amp;ldquo;moving target defense&amp;rdquo; tools
and techniques will be expected to be used in operational Federal,
State, and Local CIO environments, and potentially usable by commercial
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and IT vendors. It is anticipated that
 those tools and techniques delivered as open source technology will
require support, custom extensions, and additional applications as they
are commercially introduced.\n",

security event checkpoints, or other checkpoints.&amp;nbsp; Therefore
the technology needs to scan a large amount of people in a short time at
 a significant standoff distance between the detector and the person
being considered.&amp;nbsp; This is not a request for anomaly detection
techniques, rather methods to detect the presence of explosives
themselves.&amp;nbsp; In addition, this is not a request for trace
explosives detection that may be present on the outside of the clothing
or bag.&amp;nbsp; Identification of the explosives can greatly assist
response teams and venue authorities to mitigate a detection alarm
quickly and safely.&amp;nbsp; The desired technology must be safe to use
 on humans with limited ionizing radiation and no possible negative
health effects.&amp;nbsp; The technology should be able to penetrate
outer layers of clothing or carried bags (such as a purse or backpack).
Technologies should also detect ounces of explosive material.&amp;nbsp;
Explosives of interest include commercial, military, and homemade
explosives (in particular peroxide based).&amp;nbsp; Ideally the
technology will detect the presence of explosives concealed on a person
and carried in a bag.&amp;nbsp; Specifically, methods that rely on
differentials between the human body and a threat will not be
applicable.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPHASE I: Efforts will use theoretical and\/or
 empirical data to determine if the proposed detection method is
feasible.&amp;nbsp; A successful Phase I effort will result in a proof
of concept of the proposed detection technique with theoretical and\/or
experimental data to support this conclusion.&amp;nbsp; The concept must
 be proven or within reasonable estimations proven before a Phase II
award will be considered.\n\n\tPHASE II: Efforts will develop,
demonstrate and deliver a breadboard (TRL 3-4) prototype of the
technology.&amp;nbsp; A successful technology should detect an
appropriate explosive simulant material with reasonable accuracy and
specificity.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPHASE III: COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Efforts
will develop and design an advanced prototype (TRL 5-6) for piloting in a
 structured crowd environment.&amp;nbsp; This pilot supports the Detect
program with applications to surface transportation and various DHS
checkpoint environments.&amp;nbsp; If a Phase III contract is awarded, a
 prototype will be delivered after government acceptance testing.\n",

solicitation details located at FedBizOpps website.\n\n\tThe National
Firearms and Tactical Training Unit (NFTTU) provides support to over
62,000 armed officers and tests on average close to 200,000 handgun
rounds each year. Much of the firearms and ammunition testing is carried
 out manually by NFTTU personnel through repetitive firing. Multiple
forces are exerted on the body during the firing of a gun and repetitive
 usage can often translate to acute body pain. The NFTTU needs an
end-to-end solution to replace the human firing system with a mechanical
 device. The device should:&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\tBe easy to mount and
re-load with full magazines;\n\t\n\t\tMimic the exact counter forces of a
 broad demographic range of human hands during firing, recoil cycle,
bullet\/cartridge ejection. and post-firing forward movement of the gun;
 and\n\t\n\t\tAllow for similar accuracy as when completed by human
testers.\n\n\n\tInitial development of this capability gap will include
modeling of complex, multi-degree forces exerted on the human body when a
 gun is fired as well as the resulting reactionary\/counter forces that
are then exerted on the gun by the human body. These models might
already exist, however part of filling this capability gap will include
research on current initiatives in the federal, defense and private
sector arenas.\n\n\tPHASE I: Develop and deliver a virtual model that
will be able to characterize the various forces that are exerted on the
human body by continuous manual testing of firearms and
ammunition.&amp;nbsp; The virtual model must include all forces involved
 during the firing of a handgun.\n\n\tPHASE II: Develop and deliver a

virtual model (3D models, finite element analysis, motion modeling,
etc.) that successfully responds to the description above.\n\n\tPHASE

Person within a Security Perimeter ",
        "description": "\n\tFor details, please refer to the
solicitation details located at FedBizOpps website.\n\n\tAs a person
undergoes security screening, he or she is typically positively
identified through a credential check only once at the entrance to a
security perimeter.&amp;nbsp; Subsequent to that one credential check,
it is difficult, if not impossible, to definitively associate any other
cues; e.g., behavioral or physiological, with specific individuals once
they have passed through that checkpoint.\n\n\tAs the Science and
Technology Directorate investigates the use of distributed screening
(screening of persons for an extended period of time within a security
perimeter rather than once and only once at a single checkpoint), it
will be necessary to be able to associate specific behavioral and
physiological cues detected remotely through other means\/with other
sensors, and which may be potentially diagnostic of malintent (the
intent to cause harm to our country or its citizens), with specific
individuals with a very high degree of confidence and
accuracy.&amp;nbsp; The proposed method of tracking should not be
dependent on commonly accepted biometric identifiers (i.e., facial
recognition) in order to ensure that the proper safeguarding of
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) does not become an
issue.&amp;nbsp; Nor should the system be designed around Radio
Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. This requires that a
capability be developed that enables the continuous tracking of
individuals, without their active cooperation, in crowded environments
so that cues detected through other remote sensors can be accurately and
 unambiguously assigned to specific persons being screened.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tAt the end of Phase I, it is desired that the performer
be able to show that the proposed technology is feasible, low-cost,
networkable &amp;ndash; potentially in a distributed array &amp;ndash;
and is safe for use on humans.&amp;nbsp; This may require the use of
preexisting, commercial-off-the-shelf items that have been previously
demonstrated or otherwise certified to be safe for use on human
subjects.\n\n\tPHASE I: At the end of Phase I, the performer will
deliver and demonstrate a small-scale, proof-of-concept\/prototype
capability that is reliable, low cost, networkable, and reconfigurable
and which can serve as the foundation of a larger scale
capability.\n\n\tPHASE II: At the end of Phase II, the performer will be
 able to demonstrate and deliver a prototype of a larger scale tracking
capability based on the Phase I deliverable that can accurately and
continuously track at least one individual in an environment that is
representative of an operational security screening setting.&amp;nbsp;
It is also highly desirable that the capability be able to detect other
cues potentially diagnostic of malintent; e.g., gait,
remotely.\n\n\tPHASE III: COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: In Phase III, it is
envisioned that the performer will be able to track multiple individuals
 (three to five) in a crowded environment; e.g., critical infrastructure
 (such as a national monument, major sports stadium, or power generation
 plant) or a shopping mall (for the purposes of retail security\/theft
prevention).\n",

        "description": "\n\tType 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the
autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreatic
islets of Langerhans and affects more than one million Americans,
usually with onset in childhood or young adulthood. The disease markedly
 impairs quality of life and shortens lifespan as is associated with
numerous complications including blindness, renal failure, painful nerve
 disorders, cardiovascular disease and amputation.&amp;nbsp; In addition
 to its devastating toll in human suffering, T1D and its complications
result in significant health care expenditures for families and
constitute a major societal economic burden.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;Early
identification of T1D risk and the onset of autoimmunity provides the
basis for a variety of major ongoing studies seeking to prevent or delay
 the disease.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Already research on the natural
history of the development of T1D in at risk neonates has shown that
early identification of those at risk can foster early diagnosis of T1D
and avoid life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis DKA.&amp;nbsp; Also,
clinical trials are currently in progress to identify ways to prevent or
 reverse the autoimmunity of T1D. &amp;nbsp;Investigators have used a
combination of islet autoantibody positivity, autoantibody
seroconversion, biomarkers of genetic susceptibility and beta cell
functional assays as criteria to select individuals at high risk of
developing T1D.&amp;nbsp; However, current technology for identification
 of at risk individuals is costly, requires participation of research
laboratories, and may not be suitable for public health screening that
would ensue should effective preventative interventions be
established.&amp;nbsp; Methods for more efficient identification of
individuals at risk of T1D who may be eligible for preventative
intervention would include low cost, high-throughput, accurate and
predictive assays\/devices that could be used at the point of care
level. Application of such technologies could facilitate and expedite
testing when effective ways to prevent or delay T1D become available and
 would be essential for identifying individuals who can benefit from
such treatments. Population based screening of individuals would be
required as the majority of new cases of T1D (~70-80%) have no affected
relatives.\n\n\tThis initiative intends to stimulate and support
innovative research at small businesses for the development of low cost
novel assays and devices for predictive screening for T1D risk and
autoimmunity using genetic, immune and metabolics markers.&amp;nbsp; The
 development of these technologies would facilitate recruitment for
clinical research focused on identifying environmental triggers of T1D,
T1D natural history, and interventions to prevent T1D.&amp;nbsp; It will
 also facilitate clinical implementation of measures subsequently proven
 effective in delaying or preventing T1D in those at risk.&amp;nbsp; Use
 of such assays in organ donors could also facilitate provision of
autoimmune pancreas to researchers.\n\n\tExamples of topics relevant to
this announcement include but are not limited to:\n\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment
 of techniques or products useful for predicting, preventing or delaying
 progression of diabetes, including tests for identifying patients at
risk, and methods of monitoring disease progression.\n\t\n\t\tHigh
throughput - Point of care assays (reliable, accurate, cost-effective,
highly sensitive\/specific standardized having rapid turnaround time)
for autoantibody detection and other immune parameters for autoimmune
diabetes diagnosis and follow-up. This could also include newborn

Rollover Potential",
        "description": "\n\tThere are thousands of miles of concrete
barrier in place on the highways across the United States and many more
miles used as temporary barriers in work zones.&amp;nbsp; There are 5
typical concrete barrier shapes which have been used for years that
generally have performed acceptably.&amp;nbsp; The different shapes with
 their different design characteristics provide some tradeoffs with
crash performance.&amp;nbsp; It is well understood that the safety shape
 design incorporated to a varying degree in 4 of the designs cause the
vehicle to ride-up the barrier face which dissipate kinetic
energy.&amp;nbsp; This can also be a contributing factor to vehicle
rollover for lower angle crashes.&amp;nbsp; The vertical wall that does
not incorporate this safety shape (sloped faced) also performs
acceptably but it increases the forces on occupants, lateral forces on
the wall and under some conditions result in a high risk crash called
head slap, where the occupants head makes contact with the wall which is
 usually fatal.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tRecent research has identified there is a
 need to improve concrete barrier performance since the more commonly
used safety shape designs have a tendency to induce vehicle rollover
which can also be a very severe crash.&amp;nbsp; The Midwest Roadside
Safety Facility (located at the University of Nebraska) developed a
better performing barrier that addressed the issues but to incorporate
the features from this design would require reconstruction of the many
thousands of miles of barrier.&amp;nbsp; Other research performed by
Texas Transportation Institute and published in NCHRP 554 showed that
increased surface friction along the barrier face enhanced the rollover
problem and warns exceeding a threshold.&amp;nbsp; Subsequent
unpublished barrier simulation by NCAC for FHWA showed that reducing the
 friction along the sloped surface reduces the rollover tendencies of
TL-3 vehicles.&amp;nbsp; Some limited testing was performed at the Texas
 Transportation Institute by impacting a bogie vehicle into portable
concrete barriers coated with epoxy sealant (epoxy has extremely low
friction properties and sometimes used to simulate ice for skid
test).&amp;nbsp; The coatings were not tough enough to withstand the
impact and the results showed no benefits.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tTherefore, to
improve the performance of existing barriers and reduce vehicle rollover
 crashes, a coating, or other surface treatment for existing, in-place
concrete barriers is sought that would provide a durable low friction
material and, thereby, reduce the rollover potential of vehicles
striking barriers.&amp;nbsp; To be successful, the coating (or other
surface treatment) should
be:\n\n\t1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The product should
be low cost and easily installed in a traffic
environment\n\n\t2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Durable in
an impact so performance is not
reduced\n\n\t3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resist sunlight
degradation\n\n\tExpected Phase I Outcomes:\n\n\tOutcomes expected from
Phase I include a detailed concept that demonstrates the viability of
creating a prototype that satisfies the issues identified
above.&amp;nbsp; Also a marketing strategy that anticipates the crashes
that could be reduced and a possible deployment strategy based on a cost
 benefit approach.\n\n\tExpected Phase II Outcomes:\n\n\tPhase II
outcomes may include identifying or developing a product and crash
testing to verify product performance and durability. A field
application under controlled conditions would be necessary to
demonstrate ease of installation and test sections applied in real world
 conditions to demonstrate to the market the viability of this
approach.\n",

area of technology is known, is a very quickly changing field that has
shown and continues to show how innovative developers can be.&amp;nbsp;
Currently, there are some 40 + Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
 satellites (Global Positioning System (GPS), Wide Area Augmentation

Couple this with the development of nationwide broadband data networks

Identification Number(s) (VIN) to the Powered unit.",
        "description": "\n\tThe primary mission of Federal Motor Carrier
 Safety Administration (FMCSA)&amp;nbsp; is to reduce crashes, injuries
and fatalities involving large truck and buses. One of the strategies
employed to accomplish this goal is to foster innovative research in new
 or augmenting safety enhancing technologies and to facilitate faster
deployment of proven systems. In collaboration with our industry
partners and stakeholders, we continuously identify new opportunities of
 emphasis that can serve our agency goals and objectives towards
improving highway safety. The opportunity outlined in this solicitation
refers to a challenge that, if addressed robustly and cost-effectively,
has the potential to further aid many ongoing USDOT safety, security,
mobility and efficiency initiatives.\n\n\tBackground:\n\n\tThe
Commercial Motor Vehicle freight movement in North America involves
powered units (tractors, trucks, buses) that haul a variety of towed
units (trailers) in often changing configurations. A sample overview of
possible tractor-trailer configurations is outlined in Reference [1].
And due to the fact that the lifetime of a trailer is often much longer
than tractors, tractors must work with a variety and age of trailers
over the course of their use. To address various roadside, border
crossing, smart parking, connected vehicle initiatives, FMCSA&amp;nbsp;
would like to explore robust and very cost effective mechanisms to
communicate the trailer(s)&amp;rsquo; VIN(s) to the powered unit for
some unique opportunities. The composition of the trailer VIN includes a
 number of trailer characteristics that are defined by NHTSA that can be
 decoded and used for a variety of reasons. &amp;nbsp;(More details on
Trailer VIN can be found on pages 15-20 in
[2].)\n\n\tMotivation:\n\n\tFMCSA envisions that trailer VIN
information, if transmitted to the tractor can be used in a number of
ways to support various ongoing and future initiatives. For instance, by
 robustly identifying the accurate number of &amp;nbsp;and
characteristics of the attached Trailers, on-board safety systems
resident on the tractor can be further optimized for
performance.\n\n\tFMCSA&amp;rsquo;s Wireless Roadside Inspection (WRI)
program can use trailer VIN information in the set of data wirelessly
exchanged between a roadside unit and the tractor hauling the subject
trailer(s). With this mechanism, tractor-trailer configuration at WRI
nodes can be properly identified.\n\n\tWireless initiatives streamlining
 Border Crossing processes can use trailer VIN data in their exchange
protocols and automatically determine if the attached trailers match the
 dispatch documentation.\n\n\tUSDOT&amp;rsquo;s Connected Vehicle
Program can use the trailer VIN information to determine the accurate
number of hauled trailer units, total combination vehicle length, axle
configurations, trailer body types, etc which would aid articulated
vehicle handling within the Basic Safety Message (BSM)
definitions.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tSimilarly, decoded trailer VIN
information would aid Smart-Park initiatives with the knowledge of the
tractor-trailer configuration and total length.\n\n\tResearch
Objectives:\n\n\tThe purpose of this topic is to develop cost-effective
solutions in the form of devices that can communicate trailer VIN(s) to
the powered unit they are connected to. It is foreseen, but not
required, that the high level architecture would be composed of a
trailer based VIN transmitter and a tractor based VIN receiver and
interpreter.\n\n\tIn general, there is little challenge in communicating
 a trailer&amp;rsquo;s VIN to the tractor as a technical objective. It
can be done wirelessly (Wi-Fi, Dedicated Short Range Communications
(DSRC), etc) or over the power line using Power Line Carrier (PLC)
protocol (solutions are not limited to these options). The challenge
posed in this topic goes beyond the rather trivial ability to
communicate a VIN from a trailer unit to a tractor and the Offerors must
 address these aspects listed below, among others, of the design
challenge in their proposals.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe following are the
 general objectives, requirements and
constraints:\n\n\t1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Trailer
transmitter unit shall be very cost effective. If this project is
successful, vision is to support a decision to retrofit every single
trailer in the field with a trailer
transmitter.\n\n\t2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The trailer
 transmitter units shall be programmed once when placed on the trailer.
The tractor receiver unit shall not assume to have any a priori
knowledge of the trailers attached to the tractor or how the trailer
transmitter units may have been
configured.\n\n\t3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The
driver\/operator shall have no input to the proposed system. It shall be
 entirely automatic.\n\n\t4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The
 primary purpose of the tractor receiver unit is to receive VINs,
establish a valid number of VIN stack for the attached trailers to the
powered unit and put this information on a databus where other devices
can use it (such as the J1939 CAN bus). The Offeror&amp;rsquo;s shall
not spend any time
on\n\n\ta.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Any display
 units for purposes of displaying such info to the
driver,\n\n\tb.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Any ideas on how
 such trailer VIN information may be
used.\n\n\tc.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How to
decode VINs for meaningful
interpretations.\n\n\t5.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The
transmitter\/receiver solution shall be able to accommodate the
communication of &amp;ndash;a minimum of- five (5) unique VINs during a
given power cycle (triple trailer combination with two
dollies).\n\n\t6.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It is highly
desired (but not required) that the solution have a smart logic to be
able to sort the VINs by their proximity to the
tractor.\n\n\t7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The bandwidth
should be smartly used; during the course of the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s
operation VIN communication should not be needed continuously. The
Offeror shall propose how to structure the use of bandwidth for this
purpose. The general idea is to identify the events when the trailer
configuration may be changed after first determination and engage
re-communication at those
instances.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t8.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Particularly if an over the air transmission based solutions (wireless)
 is proposed, the Offerors shall
address\n\n\ta.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How to
 mitigate the privacy concerns associated with transmitting
VINs.\n\n\tb.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How to prevent
cross talk between surrounding units.\n\n\tIn addition to the above
technical objectives, the Offerors are asked to discuss the logistics
and governance structure that may be needed to implement their proposed
solutions in a large scale deployment scenario. For this purpose,
consider the hypothetical scenario where every trailer unit in the field
 will be retrofitted and every new trailer will be built with this
device in the future. &amp;nbsp;The particular segment of interest that
needs the Offeror&amp;rsquo;s attention is the Trailers that are already
 in service (not new builds). Offeror shall elaborate how their proposed
 solution can be streamlined in a way that such a hypothetical mandate
can be streamlined and carried out cost effectively and in a timely
manner. Please discuss the additional devices, tools, governance
structure that may be needed to make this a possibility with the
proposed approach.\n\n\tGeneral concepts that need attention shall
include the installation ease and costs; the process of programming the
trailer VIN transmitter units (where, when, how, by whom);
susceptibility of the units for tampering and\/or failure in service;
self diagnostics needs and solutions; governance structure that may be
needed.\n\n\tExpected Phase I Outcomes:\n\n\tOutcomes expected from the
Phase 1 include a detailed concept that demonstrates the viability of
creating a prototype of the Contractor&amp;rsquo;s approach that
satisfies the attributes described above for Trailer VIN transmission to
 the Tractor. In addition to the above technical objectives, the
Contractor will need to discuss cost-benefit trade-offs, logistics and
governance structures that may be needed to implement their proposed
solutions in a large scale deployment scenario.\n\n\tExpected Phase II
Outcomes:\n\n\tPhase 2 efforts include manufacturing and demonstration
of a working prototype of the Contractor&amp;rsquo;s approach of
transmitting Trailer VINs to the tractor in a number of combination
vehicle configurations including multi-unit cases. Furthermore, a
detailed experimental plan for assessing the robustness and accuracy
levels of the solutions shall be developed and the process for
implementing a retrofit concept shall be demonstrated for ease of
installation, programming, verification, deployment, scalability etc.
Finally, a scenario based preliminary cost-benefit analysis and\/or
projections shall be conducted in collaboration with USDOT.\n",

        "topic_name": "Innovative Solutions to Effectively Enforce
Anti-texting Rules on Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) Drivers ",
        "description": "\n\tThe primary mission of Federal Motor Carrier
 Safety Administration (FMCSA)&amp;nbsp; is to reduce crashes, injuries
and fatalities involving large truck and buses. One of the strategies
employed to accomplish this goal is to foster innovative research in new
 or augmenting safety enhancing technologies, novel safety enforcement
techniques and aides, as well as to facilitate faster deployment of
proven systems. In collaboration with our industry partners and
stakeholders, we continuously identify new opportunities of emphasis
that can serve our agency goals and objectives towards improving highway
 safety. The opportunity outlined in this solicitation refers to a
challenge that, if addressed robustly and cost-effectively, has the high
 potential to better enforce anti-texting rules dictated by FMCSA and
help eliminate or substantially reduce a serious safety violation
committed while driving.\n\n\tBackground:\n\n\t&amp;ldquo;Texting while
driving&amp;rdquo; is proven to be among the most dangerous acts a
driver can commit. Based on the supporting research findings, FMCSA has
issued a comprehensive anti-texting rule for majority of Commercial
Driver&amp;rsquo;s License (CDL) holders yet robust, objective methods
to enforce these rules on CMV drivers do not
exist.\n\n\t&amp;ldquo;Texting while driving&amp;rdquo; is the act of
composing, reading or sending text messages or emails on a mobile device
 while operating a vehicle. &amp;ldquo;Texting on the wheel&amp;rdquo;
diverts the full attention a truck driver must dedicate to
navigating&amp;nbsp;his\/her vehicle away from this core
task&amp;nbsp;increasing the&amp;nbsp;Odds Ratio of being involved in a
Safety Critical event. Commercial Vehicle Driver Distraction studies
showed that the Odds Ratio associated with Texting on a cell phone
&amp;ndash;while driving- is more than 20, as confirmed in 2 separate
studies analyzing naturalistic driving data in 2009 and 2010 (See
references [1], [2]). &amp;nbsp;This ratio indicates that the risk
factors associated with being involved in a safety critical event while
texting is at least 20-fold higher than during normal attentive
driving.\n\n\tCurrently, 19 states and the District of Columbia have
comprehensive laws prohibiting texting behind the wheel, [3], effects of
 which extend beyond the CMV drivers.\n\n\tOn the same subject area, the
 FMCSA has issued a final rule, effective October 27, 2010, banning
texting by operators of commercial vehicles covering as many vehicle
drivers as possible, within its statutory authority. It also narrowed an
 exception to the texting ban to prohibit texting&amp;mdash;but not
other functions&amp;mdash;on a dispatching device or a device that is
part of a fleet management system.&amp;nbsp; Substantial CDL suspension
and civil penalties are proposed for repeat violators of the
anti-texting rules and for carriers who allow or require
texting.\n\n\tPurpose:\n\n\tDespite the strictly scripted Anti-texting
rules for CMV drivers, there are no robust means to enforce them without
 involving subjective observations or assessments by the enforcement
officers. It is often presumed that the implied civil and suspension
penalties are severe enough to act as a preventive measure. However,
there have been no studies or experiments conducted to verify this
assumption. Since the inception of the final rule, there have been only a
 few cases of cited violations. At the time of writing, there have been
no recorded cases of CDL suspensions, nor has there been any civil
penalties imposed on CDL drivers due to this rule. These statistics
could suggest that anti-texting rule enforcement efficacy can be
substantially improved.\n\n\tA recent Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI)
 study finds that there has not been observed benefits from anti-texting
 rules and hypothesizes two possible reasons for this observation:
&amp;quot;texters may realize that texting bans are difficult to
enforce, so they may have little incentive to reduce texting for fear of
 being detected and fined,&amp;quot; or, texters may have responded to
the ban by &amp;quot;hiding their phones from view, potentially
increasing their distractive effects by requiring longer glances away
from the road.&amp;quot;, [4].\n\n\tToday, most of the anti-cell phone
and anti-texting laws are subjectively enforced based on suspicion or
observation of violation by the enforcement officers. To make matters
even more challenging, on a CMV truck cabs are often positioned higher
than light vehicle compartments and visual based detection techniques
for identification of texting violations are considered more difficult
and rare.\n\n\tSample Solutions:\n\n\tHistorically, anti-texting and
anti-cell phone use have been approached in two ways. (1) By preventing
the use of all or certain functions of a cell phone (for texting, web
surfing, making calls etc) when the vehicle is in operation [preventive
measures via on-board safety system integration] (2) By identifying
instances of texting-when-in-motion in the aftermath [detection based
solutions after the act of violation].\n\n\tCurrently there are many
companies that provide cell-phone use restricting solutions in the form
of applications for smart phones. They often use the on-board GPS data
or a link to vehicle databus to determine when the vehicle is in motion
and disable cell-phone use while at speed with the exception of making
emergency calls. These methods do not provide all encompassing solution,
 can often be overridden, and primarily depend on the choice to install,
 and the use of an application on the cell phone. Furthermore, it does
not prevent the use of another cell phone which may not feature similar
applications. NHTSA is currently carrying out an experiment assessing
the efficacy of such systems in a light vehicle fleet environment based
on the concept of voluntary participation. These solutions are seen as
less feasible for a CMV operating environment due to longer driving
periods. Some additional options are studied in the World Health
Organization&amp;rsquo;s (WHO) Distracted Driving report in
[6].\n\n\tDetection and enforcement of &amp;ldquo;texting that may have
taken place while operating a vehicle&amp;rdquo; after the action takes
place has not been researched deeply. Theoretically, there are databases
 that can be cross-checked to identify such instances. For instance, an
Electronic On-Board Recorder (EOBR) has the ability to record the
vehicle motion history and cell phone records that contain
&amp;ldquo;texting&amp;rdquo; event records. Both of these databases can
 be synched with respect to a Universal coordinated time and could be
cross-checked for violations. However, there are numerous existing
privacy and data ownership rights issues that need to be researched.
Furthermore, it should be understood that the proposed recommended
solution may or may not fall within the legislative authority of
FMCSA.\n\n\tObjectives:\n\n\tThe primary research objective is to
research existing and upcoming technologies that could be used to better
 enforce anti-texting laws for CDL holders operating CMVs. The relevant
research should include but not be limited to the inventory of existing,
 foreseeable, feasible, and possible methods in North America and
abroad:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Cell-phone use blocking technologies and
applications,\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Leveraging insurance company initiatives and potential future practices
 to access the insured individual&amp;rsquo;s cell phone records to
determine their insurance
premiums,\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Enforcement\/promotion of applications that enable hands-free and
voice-activated interactions&amp;nbsp; of cell-phone
operation,\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Possibilities of requiring or recommending wireless service
providers\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; to log GPS speed with text message
read\/write date and timestamps\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; to broadcast a
 Bluetooth message every time texting is performed such that the event
could be captured by a device such as an Electronic On-board Recorder
(EOBR).\n\n\tThe general research objective is to formulate existing and
 possible options, their feasibility, risks, and costs and benefits of
such options. It shall document the limitations (what it can and it
cannot detect), capabilities, potential unintended consequences,
misdetection sources and whether or not they can become feasible
methods, tools or practices to enforce anti-texting rules.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The approach can involve an on-board safety system
dedicated to the objective, a handheld-tool for enforcement officers to
detect violations in the field, and\/or other creative methods that can
near eliminate anti-texting law violations either in the form of
preventive measures or corrective measures that rely on objective
detection of committed violations.\n\n\tSome
constraints\/objectives\/notes for the
research:\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Note that there may be other
devices than cell phones on a given CMV that leverage cell-tower links
and hence, proposed solutions shall not interfere with their operations
(e.g. cellular signal jamming techniques may not be
feasible).\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Offerors must address how to
make their proposed solutions robust. For example, if the proposed
recommended solution is an application to run on a cell-phone which
blocks its use when the vehicle is in motion, the Proposer must at least
 address 1) how to make the proposed application available on all legacy
 and future phone platforms including but not limited to smart phones,
2) how to assure applications would be loaded and used 3) how to
overcome possibility of the driver bringing other phones on the vehicle
that may not feature the said application.\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It
 is desired that the driver shall have access to his phone when stopped
and interference from other vehicles operating around it shall not
prevent its functions when stopped.\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The
proposed solutions shall take into account the possibility of the
operator bringing another cell phone on the vehicle than the one that
may be provided by the carrier.\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; FMCSA has a
regulation, 392.60 [7], prohibiting the transportation of unauthorized
persons on CMVs other than a bus.\n\n\tTo be considered responsive to
this SBIR topic, it is not sufficient to propose a trade study and
attach a capability statement. The Offerors are asked to describe
outlines of novel options and think through the feasibility of a large
scale deployed solutions. Please also consider and address costs,
governance, privacy, robustness concerns in the project outline and
approach.\n\n\tExpected Phase I Outcomes:\n\n\tOutcomes expected from
the Phase 1 include a detailed concept that demonstrates the viability
of creating a prototype of the Contractor&amp;rsquo;s approach that
satisfies the attributes described above. In addition, a high level
cost-benefit analysis will be needed to assess the concept&amp;rsquo;s
large scale deployment feasibility.\n\n\tExpected Phase II
Outcomes:\n\n\tPhase 2 efforts include manufacturing and demonstration
of a working prototype of the Contractor&amp;rsquo;s approach to
validate its Anti-texting law enforcement improvements for commercial
motor vehicle drivers. Furthermore, a detailed experimental plan for
assessing the efficacy of the solution should be formulated along with
updated cost-benefit projections based on Phase II activities and
learnings.\n",

Note:&amp;nbsp; Small Business Concerns may submit a proposal for all
three focus areas.&amp;nbsp; Proposals addressing multiple focus areas
for this topic must be submitted separately.\n\n\tThe biggest source of
energy in the United States of America is petroleum, including oil and
natural gas. Together, they supply 65 percent of the energy we use.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, oil furnishes
40 percent of our energy, natural gas 25 percent, coal 22 percent,
nuclear 8 percent, and renewables make up 4 percent.\n\n\tThe
nation&amp;#39;s more than two million miles of pipelines safely deliver
 trillions of cubic feet of natural gas and hundreds of billions of
ton\/miles of liquid petroleum products each year. They are essential:
the volumes of energy products they move are well beyond the capacity of
 other forms of transportation. It would take a constant line of tanker
trucks, about 750 per day, loading up and moving out every two minutes,
24 hours a day, seven days a week, to move the volume of even a modest
pipeline. The railroad-equivalent of this single pipeline would be a
train of 75 2,000-barrel tank rail cars every day. These alternatives
would require many times the people, clog the air with engine
pollutants, be prohibitively expensive and -- with many more vehicles on
 roads and rails carrying hazardous materials -- unacceptably
dangerous.\n\n\tPipeline systems are the safest means to move these
products. The federal government rededicated itself to pipeline safety
in 2006 when the PIPES Act was signed. It mandates new methods and makes
 commitments for new technologies to manage the integrity of the
nation&amp;#39;s pipelines and raise the bar on pipeline
safety.\n\n\tPHMSA safety jurisdiction over pipelines covers more than
3,000 gathering, transmission, and distribution operators as well as
some 52,000 master meter and liquefied natural gas (LNG) operators who
own and\/or operate approximately 1.6 million miles of gas pipelines, in
 addition to over 200 operators and an estimated 155,000 miles of
hazardous liquid pipelines. This supply of energy has too often been
disrupted by pipeline leaks that can pose a threat to public safety. In
addition, damage from excavation is the leading cause for in-field
utilities disruption.\n\n\tFor Pipeline Safety, research is sought
toward the development of the following innovative technologies and

pipelines.\n\n\tAreas of interest include but are not limited to:\n",

Insert and Assembly for Cased Pipelines",
        "description": "\n\tCurrently, inspection and assessment of pipe
 condition in cased pipelines is mostly limited to direct and in-line
assessment methods such as ILI tools, open-cuts, ultrasonic&amp;rsquo;s
inspection and External Corrosion Direct Assessment (ECDA) practices.
These methods are expensive, time consuming, and do not fully prevent
leaks, failures and damage to life, property and the
environment.&amp;nbsp; Corrosion and integrity issues continue to
jeopardize public safety and leak detection continues to present a
significant challenge, especially for small leaks.&amp;nbsp; While
pipelines remain inherently vulnerable to both accidents and deliberate
disruption due to their number and dispersion, making pipeline safety
and security closely intertwined.\n\n\tRecent technological innovations
offer potential enhancements to pipeline safety, security and
reliability with new assessment techniques, including an improved
ability to find and eliminate problems before they become hazardous.
While new pipeline monitoring technologies, such as continuous leak
detection, corrosion monitoring, and motion sensing continue to emerge
and improve, the difficulty remains of how to apply such advances to the
 existing infrastructure of cased pipelines.\n\n\tWhile casted
containment systems eliminate the need for external cathodic protection
and also provide leak containment, traditional designs can only provide a
 limited capability for leveraging continuous-run monitoring
technologies, especially once the pipeline is buried underground, as the
 internal support structure (sometimes referred to as
&amp;ldquo;spacers&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;spiders&amp;rdquo;, or
&amp;ldquo;doughnuts&amp;rdquo;) impede utilization of the available
interior space between the carrier and containment
pipes.\n\n\tSubsequently, a gap in technology available is evident. An
envisioned solution could comprise an improvement on the existing
casement configuration that will enable best in class problem detection
and containment over the life of the pipeline by maximizing the
utilization of double casing interior space for multiple monitoring
technologies in such a way that it is easily accessed once the pipeline
is buried.\n\n\tIn this focus area, applications are sought to study,
develop and demonstrate new concepts of multi-channel insert and
assembly for cased pipelines.\n\n\tThe applicant will study, develop and
 test a novel pipeline insert and assembly that creates multiple
separate and independent linear compartments within the interior space
of a cased piping system and that will support the carrier pipe within
the containment pipe.&amp;nbsp; Anticipated results will include
enabling the use of multiple monitoring technologies, such as leak
detection, motion sensing, wall thickness measurement and corrosion
monitoring in the same pipeline.&amp;nbsp; Besides facilitating initial
installation and ongoing operation of multiple technologies, it should
enable forward compatibility of the cased pipeline with future
monitoring technologies yet to be developed, as new monitoring systems
should be able to be easily run through the annular chambers along the
length of the pipe.\n\n\tExpected Phase I outcomes:\n\n\tPhase I
activities may include a complete feasibility study, including analysis
of product and whole solution costs, value calculations, detailed
technical and market analysis of target applications, market research
and analysis of additional potential applications.\n\n\tExpected Phase
II outcomes:\n\n\tPhase II activities may include product prototyping,
testing then designing and building deployable systems followed by
analysis\/testing in field environments.\n",

that are assembled into Systems (ES) built for Applications (IA) that
are employed to deliver Services (IS). Innovations across the stack can
range widely, and hardware as well as software innovations will be
supported. Considering the two ends of the stack, device innovations
will typically employ unique physical phenomena for their competitive
advantage and be embodied in hardware, whereas innovations in services
will typically be more architectural in nature and be embodied in
software.\n\n\tProposals must address one of the subtopics that are

 Therapeutics and Monitoring Technologies for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)
Towards an Artificial Pancreas",
        "description": "\n\tType 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the
autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreatic
islets of Langerhans and affects more than one million Americans,
usually with onset in childhood or young adulthood. The disease markedly
 impairs quality of life and shortens lifespan primarily through
premature mortality.&amp;nbsp; T1D is associated with numerous
complications including blindness, renal failure, painful nerve
disorders, and amputation.&amp;nbsp; In addition to its devastating toll
 in human suffering, T1D and its complications result in significant
health care expenditures for families and constitute a major societal
economic burden.\n\n\tClinical Trials have demonstrated significant
reductions in complications of T1D through intensive control of blood
glucose levels. However, despite the availability of increasingly
effective treatment modalities, including insulin analogues, continuous
glucose monitors (CGMs) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion
(CSII) devices, a substantial proportion of patients with T1D cannot
achieve optimal glycemic control despite enormous efforts. Compounding
this difficulty is the trade-off between improved glycemic control and
an increased risk for potentially life-threatening hypoglycemia.\n\n\tA
promising therapeutic option for the treatment of diabetes is a system
(termed an artificial pancreas or closed-loop) that can mimic normal
pancreatic beta cell function thereby restoring normal metabolic
homeostasis without causing hypoglycemia.&amp;nbsp; However, there are
important technological obstacles such as glucose-sensing inaccuracies,
imperfect algorithms for calculating the appropriate dose of insulin
taking into consideration diet and physical activity, insulin
pumps&amp;rsquo; mechanical problems, time delay from subcutaneous
insulin infusion to pharmacologic effect and biocompatibility issues
that need to be resolved through the development of new technologies
that may lead to a new generation of integrated\/automated devices. The
ultimate research goal would be the development of mechanical or
bio-artificial systems that may improve metabolic control and decrease
glycemic excursions robustly preventing hypoglycemic episodes.\n\n\tThis
 FOA is intended to support cutting edge research conducted by small
business leading to the development of innovative technologies that may

        "topic_name": " Development of Companion Diagnostic",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\tRecently, the demand
for companion diagnostics has greatly increased with the recognition
that matching the right patient to the right drug can improve patient
care and may decrease health care costs. More than a dozen companion
diagnostic tests have been approved by the FDA to guide the prescription
 of products in oncology, cardiovascular disease, and infectious
disease. Among them, tests of Philadelphia chromosome, tumor-associated
EGFR overexpression, and HER2 protein overexpression have been
identified by the FDA as &amp;quot;required&amp;quot; for the
identification of candidate cancer patients for receiving Gleevec,
Erbitux (cetuximab) and Herceptin (trastuzumab), respectively, in
certain indications.\n\t\n\t\tDespite initial success, many therapies in
 the cancer arena are still lacking prediction and guidance from
companion diagnostics. This is true for both primary as well as adjuvant
 treatments. In particular, many patients die from recurrence and
metastasis as a result of unpredicted resistance to drugs and\/or
radiation developed during therapy, or due to pre-existing tumor
insensitivity to the drugs and\/or radiation therapy. Guidance towards
effective and safe therapy is therefore much in need. Companion
diagnostics include tests that are developed after a drug has come to
market, tests that are being developed in conjunction with the
development of a drug and tests to predict the interaction of novel
agents with existing standard of care therapies such as radiation or
cytotoxic chemotherapy. This contract topic seeks to stimulate research,
 development, and commercialization of innovative tests and technology
platforms for all these types of companion diagnostic applications.
Companies with advanced biomarkers are particularly encouraged to
apply.\n\t\n\t\tProject Goals:\n\t\n\t\tThe goal of this contract topic
is to develop companion diagnostics for selecting patients for which a
particular therapeutic regimen, including existing drugs and those in
clinical development and radiation, will be safe and effective. Although
 the example companion diagnostic tests mentioned above are for targeted
 therapies, tests may also encompass therapeutics outside of this class.
 These tests include, but are not limited to tumor RNA\/protein
expression or overexpression, gene mutation or deletion\/insertion,
allelic variation, and enzymatic deficiency. Noninvasive and minimally
invasive sampling methods (e.g., body fluids and mouth swab) are
preferred. Other sampling methods are also acceptable if they provide
significantly improved predictive value, accuracy, and clinical
applicability. This topic is not intended to support the development of
assays unless they provide predictive\/prognostic information for a
therapy. For example, development of an assay for the sole purpose of
measuring whether the drug hits its target would not be considered
responsive.\n\t\n\t\tPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables:\n\t\n\t\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

must be tested with datasets other than those used for their
development.\n\t\n\t\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 In cases where the drug for which the companion diagnostics being
developed is not yet commercially available on the market, the applicant
 must provide proof of collaboration or partnership with a large
diagnostic company (e.g. Quest, Qiagen) or the entity that is

        "topic_name": "Development of Radiation Modulators For Use
During Radiotherapy",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tRadiotherapy is employed in
the treatment of over half of all cancer patients. Many of those
patients however, may suffer some adverse effects from this therapy
during and\/or after treatment. In addition, in approximately half of
the patients treated with curative intent, the tumors recur. Enhancing
specific tumor killing and minimizing normal tissue damage from
radiotherapy would improve tumor control and patient quality of life. An
 ideal intervention would enhance both radiation effects in tumors and
protect the normal tissues.\n\n\tRadiosensitizersare agents that are
intended to enhance tumor cell killing while having a minimal effect on
normal tissues. Recently, two new radiation sensitization drugs have
proven clinically effective: Temozolomide treatment with radiotherapy
for glioblastoma and Cetuximab treatment combined with radiation for
head and neck squamous cell cancers. A large number of other targeted
therapies are possible and although some are currently in varying phases
 of development, there is significant potential for further development
of novel agents.\n\n\tConventionally, radioprotectors are defined as
agents given before radiation exposure to prevent or reduce damage to
normal tissues, while mitigators refer to those agents given during or
after a patient&amp;rsquo;s prescribed course of radiation therapy to
prevent or reduce imminent damage to normal tissues. Both
radioprotectors and mitigators are also being developed as potential
countermeasures against radiological terrorism and several have shown
promise in pre-clinical testing. In order for these to be developed and
useful in clinical radiation therapy applications it is imperative to
demonstrate that they do not protect cancer cells.\n\n\tThe importance
of developing agents that sensitize tumor cells, protect or mitigate
radiation-induced damage in normal tissue, improve survival, quality of
life, and palliative care in cancer patients was emphasized in a recent
NCI workshop on Advanced Radiation Therapeutics - Radiation Injury
Mitigation held on January 25th 2010 (2), and in a workshop on Radiation
 Resistance in Cancer Therapy: Its Molecular Bases and Role of the
Microenvironment on its Expression held Sept 1-3, 2010. Prior workshops
have dealt with sensitization, protection, or radiation effects
assessment (3,4).\n\n\tThis contract topic aims to encourage the
development of innovative and promising radioprotectants, mitigators, or
 sensitizers that either selectively protect normal tissues (but not
tumors) against ionizing radiation or selectively sensitize tumors,
thereby increasing the therapeutic ratio of radiation. Proposals for
radiation modulators are solicited that include preclinical and\/or
early phase clinical studies demonstrating safety, efficacy, dose,
schedule, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and metabolism.
Proposals should also demonstrate a clear understanding of regulatory
requirements, and should include a regulatory plan including key steps
such as a pre-IND meeting with FDA, submitting an investigational new
drug (IND) application, approval of clinical trial design, and
ultimately drug registration.\n\n\tProject goals:\n\n\tThe goal is to
stimulate collaborations among academic institutions, small businesses,
and contract research organizations in order to promote the rapid
development of innovative radioresponse modifiers that will decrease
normal tissue injury and\/or enhance tumor killing thereby improving
radiotherapy outcomes. The long-term goal is to enable small businesses
to fully develop, license, and\/or market radioresponse modifiers for
clinical use.\n\n\tThe contract proposal must describe:\n\n\tPhase
I:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 A quantitative estimate of the patient population that will benefit
from the availability of such radioresponse
modifiers.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 A plan for generating evidence that the proposed compound(s) protects
at least one relevant normal tissue from radiation-induced injury,
and\/or sensitizes at least two relevant tumor
models.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Either: 1) A plan for generating evidence that the proposed
radioprotector(s)\/mitigators(s) do not significantly protect cancer
cells, or 2) A plan for generating evidence that the proposed
radiosensitizer(s) do not significantly sensitize normal cells and
tissues.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The plans must include the methodologies proposed to evaluate the
preferential effects on normal tissues or tumors by the compound(s) in
vivo (including appropriate biomarkers and endpoints as determined
during early interactions with the
FDA).\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Determination of the optimum dose and schedule in vivo based upon
preclinical pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
studies.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Statistical validation of the proposed study endpoints including where
appropriate, power calculations and rationale for proposed sample
sizes.\n\n\tPhase
II:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The approach to early-phase human trials, as indicated, that are
designed taking into account the relevant molecular pathways and targets
 and aim to gather pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data to confirm
the compound&amp;rsquo;s observed behavior in animal
studies.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The approach to assessing the safety and efficacy of the compound(s) in
 early-phase human trials employing, as appropriate, physician-reported
endpoints as well as patient-reported outcomes.\n\n\tActivities and
ExpectedDeliverables:\n\n\tPhase I may include primarily preclinical
studies. Phase II or &amp;quot;Fast-Track&amp;quot; proposals must
contain a section entitled &amp;quot;Regulatory Plan&amp;quot; detailing
 plans for early involvement of the FDA. There should be a description
of how the applicant plans on meeting the requirements to: 1) define
suitable biomarkers and endpoints, 2) file IND and 3) design and perform
 phase 0-2 clinical trials in preparation for product transition to
phase 3 clinical trials by groups such as the RTOG. Where cooperation of
 other partners is critical for implementation of the proposed
methodology, the applicant should provide evidence of such cooperation
(through partnering arrangement, letters of support, etc.).\n\n\tThe
following deliverables may be required depending on a
compound&amp;rsquo;s maturity in the developmental pipeline:\n\n\tPhase
I:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

        "topic_name": "Reformulation of Cancer Therapeutics using
Nanotechnology",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe design of novel
therapies and drug delivery systems for cancer is being enabled by
nanotechnology. Nanoscale devices carrying therapeutic payloads and
delivered within close proximity of the tumor in vivo will play a
significant role in increasing the effectiveness of the treatment while
decreasing severity of side effects. Such techniques would be highly
relevant, particularly for organs that are difficult to access because
of a variety of biological barriers, including those developed by
tumors. The successful delivery of well established chemotherapeutics
using nanoparticle-based delivery platforms has previously been
demonstrated; however, an even bigger opportunity that can be enabled by
 nanoparticle delivery is the potential to mitigate the adverse
properties of once promising drugs which failed to reach clinical trials
 or failed in clinical trials due to excessive toxicity and can be
reformulated into safe and viable therapies using nanoparticles.
Furthermore, poor oral bioavailability, poor solubility in biological
fluids, inappropriate pharmacokinetics, and lack of efficacy within a
tolerable dose range can be also addressed using such reformulation
approaches.\n\n\tTo accelerate such efforts, the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) requests proposals for the development of
commercially-viable nanotechnology-based platforms for the reformulation
 of cancer therapeutics.\n\n\tProject Goals:\n\n\tThe goal of this
project is to identify and evaluate the potential of candidate
nanotechnologies to significantly improve the performance of anti-cancer
 agents. Specifically, this topic is intended to fund nanotechnology
delivery systems which will enable anti-cancer drugs which could not
otherwise be delivered in free form due to their excessive toxicity,
poor oral bioavailability, poor solubility in biological fluids,
inappropriate pharmacokinetics, and lack of efficacy within a tolerable
dose range to be re-examined as potential therapies for cancer
treatment. Drug-nanoparticle constructs must yield a significant
improvement in properties with respect to the free drug and FDA-approved
 formulations of the drug. Of special interest are drug-nanoparticle
constructs which mitigate the unacceptable properties of the drugs which
 may not currently be administered to humans in free form.\n\n\tThese
drug-nanoparticle constructs can take, for example, the form of
multi-functional targeted nanoparticles or multi-chamber chips carrying
encapsulated drugs. Further, the drug-nanoparticle constructs may also
utilize imaging agents for a combination of therapeutic and diagnostic
modalities that aim to provide real-time feedback and monitoring of
therapy. They may include, but are not limited to the
following:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 novel therapeutic
nanodevices\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 devices involving novel tumor targeting and concentrations
schemes\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 novel drug loading and releasing
schemes\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 novel therapeutic or theranostic nanodevices which are able to cross

        "topic_name": "Probing Tumor Microenvironment Using In Vivo
Nanotechnology-based Sensors",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tBiological fluids and tissue
 biopsies provide important information with respect to a diagnosis of
cancer and to efficacy of its treatment. The collection of both
(especially the biopsy) is invasive and can be achieved only in single
time points with limited frequency. The analysis of biological fluids
(blood, urine), which are easier to collect, do not provide for direct
representation of the tumor development. It assesses the status of the
tumor only on the basis of biomarkers which are given away by the tumor
and release to the biological fluid. The release of these biomarkers and
 its close correlation to tumor growth varies from organ to organ and
its kinetics is not well understood.\n\n\tOn the other hand, ability to
monitor tumor microenvironment directly in vivo, in close proximity to
the tumor site, will facilitate for a significant improvement in the
collection of data (metabolite concentrations, biomarkers, enzymatic
activity) associated with tumor growth and its behavior under treatment.
 It will also contribute to advancing out understanding of metastasis.
Nanotechnology allows for the design and manufacture of complex
multi-functional particles and devices which could yield temporal data
for these important parameters in vivo. This could be achieved in
several ways: 1) through the development of nanoparticles with surfaces
or biological coatings which recognize parameters associated with tumor
microenvironment where tumor-targeted particles are introduced
systemically; 2) through the design of implantable biochemical sensors
which can collect data over the extended period of time; 3) through the
design of circulating nano-sensors which collect data while traveling in
 blood stream and then are excreted from the body for further
evaluation.\n\n\tTo accelerate such efforts, the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) requests proposals for the development of
commercially-viable nanotechnology-based diagnostic platforms capable of
 monitoring tumor microenvironment in vivo.\n\n\tProject Goals:\n\n\tThe
 goal of the project is to develop nano-enabled in vivo diagnostic
platforms that can provide increased sensitivity and specificity in
detecting cancer or cancer metastasis or monitoring effectiveness of the
 treatment in pre-clinical animal models of cancer and\/or in human
patients. These capabilities will offer clinicians a way to maximize
opportunities for early disease recognition and produce positive
clinical outcomes.\n\n\tPotential relevant sensing nanoplatforms could
include, but are not limited to:\n\n\tNano-enabled Sensing Platforms for
 In Vivo Applications\n\n\tExamples: Several different design modalities
 can be considered: 1) use of nanoparticles which are introduced
systemically or locally and possess surfaces or biological coatings
which recognize parameters associated with tumor microenvironment and
report their change (through the change of electrical, optical, magnetic
 signal); 2) use of biochemical sensors which are implanted and can
collect data over the extended period of time; 3) use of systemically
introduced nanoparticles or nanodevices which collect the data and
subsequently are excreted for further evaluation.\n\n\tPotential
Applications: Diagnosis of cancer or cancer metastasis or long-term
monitoring of treatment effectiveness based on biochemical markers or
CTCs or other physiological indicators such as pH or oxygen
level.\n\n\tGiven the diversity of potential applications discussed
above, submitted proposals should place emphasis on the specific
nanotechnology-enabling component of the proposed platform.\n\n\tPhase I

Processing &amp;amp; Analysis of In Vivo Images",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tImage processing algorithms
are increasingly important as imaging and image-guided intervention
technologies become critical in screening, diagnosis, staging, treatment
 and monitoring of cancer patients. The use of in vivo imaging
modalities such as MRI, X-ray, CT, Positron Emission Tomography, Nuclear
 Medicine, Ultrasound, Optical Coherence Tomography, and Photo-acoustic
imaging, as well as multi-modality imaging for the management of cancer
patients has continued to increase exponentially. As more and more
imaging data becomes available, innovative software algorithms for image
 processing and analysis will be a critical need for effective use of
the information presented by medical images.\n\n\tImproved image
processing and analysis software serves the needs of cancer patients by
enhancing the ability to distinguish viable cancer from necrotic cells,
or swelling, or other benign causes of persistent radiographic
abnormalities. Advanced software also allows the radiologist to detect
cancer earlier, when treatments may be more effective, and to perform a
non-invasive or image-guided needle biopsy approach to diagnose cancer
and avoid an open surgical procedure. In many cases, advanced
visualization and post processing algorithms enable faster and more
accurate assessment of disease extent to guide treatment options, at the
 time of diagnosis and during treatment.\n\n\tProject goals:\n\n\tThe
short-term goal of this topic is to develop robust algorithms to enable
faster and more accurate decision making for imaging and image-guided
interventions. These include but are not limited to the
following:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

 Novel methods for feature extraction, object recognition to develop
tools for computer-aided detection (CAD) and monitor changes over

 Algorithms to process large image data sets quickly.\n\n\tDevelopment
of algorithms for image acquisition and\/or routine image processing for
 a new medical imaging device is not appropriate for this solicitation
and should not be submitted. Image processing algorithms that are vendor
 independent and can be applied to multiple modalities are strongly
encouraged by the NCI. However, this does not exclude the possibility
that future commercialization may be executed initially through a single
 vendor.\n\n\tIt is expected that the proposed innovation will be driven
 by clinical practice. Therefore, in addition to standard proposal
components; the contract proposal must contain specific discussion of
the target patient population and evidence of an existing clinical
problem which is addressed by the proposed method. The proposal must
also contain an analysis of competitive methods to address the same
problem and explanation of competitive technical advantages of proposed
algorithm. All Phase II or Fast-Track proposals MUST contain a section
entitled &amp;ldquo;Regulatory Plan&amp;rdquo; that demonstrates an
understanding of the regulatory requirements for clearing the software
device through the FDA, details the company&amp;rsquo;s plan to meet the
 requirements, and explains how the proposed work helps to meet these
requirements. If regulatory approval is not expected to be required, the
 offeror must provide an extensive justification for this.\n\n\tThe
long-term goal of the program is to create software packages with novel
algorithms that can be integrated into one or more different commercial
imaging platforms, where appropriate.\n\n\tApplicants are encouraged to
explore affiliations with the NCI Research Networks such as the
Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN)

Toolkit for Cancer Diagnosis, Staging, and Treatment ",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tMedical imaging plays a key
role in clinical management of cancer patients. Cancer imaging agents
are used in conjunction with medical imaging equipment, and, by
highlighting the contrast between normal and malignant tissues, they
allow the collection of information on cancer presence, spread, and
metabolism.\n\n\tRecent scientific advances in nanotechnology,
radiochemistry, reporter gene imaging, cancer stem cell imaging, and
other fields now enable the development of novel imaging agents
for:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Early detection and diagnosis of
cancer\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

 Evaluation of tumor response to chemotherapy and radiation
therapy\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Detection of cancer recurrence\n\n\tHowever, despite significant
preclinical scientific progress, very few cancer imaging agents are
actually available in the clinic. Therefore, this SBIR contract topic
seeks to stimulate the commercialization of novel imaging agents,
including: nanotechnology-based imaging agents, radiopharmaceuticals for
 positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed
tomography (SPECT), targeted contrast agents for X-ray, computed
tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical contrast
agents, and reporter gene imaging technologies.\n\n\tOne specific area
of interest under this topic is the development of single-domain
antibody fragments used to target radionuclides for imaging and targeted
 radiotherapy of cancer. Single-domain antibody fragments comprise the
single variable region of naturally-occurring antibodies that lack a
light chain or engineered antibody fragments. This type of small protein
 or peptide has advantages over conventional antibodies and antibody
fragments in terms of favorable and tunable clearance kinetics, ability
to recognize hidden or uncommon epitopes, agent format flexibility, and
ease of manufacture. Therefore, developing an imaging technology for
early diagnosis of cancer at the molecular level based on single domain
antibody fragments will be encouraged.\n\n\tProject goals:\n\n\tThe
short-term goal of this SBIR contract topic is to support research and
development activity at small businesses that are developing cancer
imaging agents. The imaging agent should be novel and, when appropriate,
 have high affinity and specificity against tumor targets. It should
also display fast in vivo clearance, rapid tumor accumulation,
sufficient in vivo stability and good biovailability, and low
immunogenicity and toxicity. The work scope may include animal testing,
formulation, GMP production, pharmacokinetic studies, pharmacodynamic
studies, and toxicological studies. These data will support the
rationale for continued development of the experimental medical imaging
agent to the point of filing an Investigational New Drug application
(IND).\n\n\tThe long-term goal of this contract topic is to enable small
 businesses to bring novel classes of fully developed cancer imaging
agents to the clinic and the market. Therefore, businesses are
encouraged to submit applications for development of lead compounds
representing novel technology platforms.\n\n\tPhase I Activities and
Expected Deliverables:\n\n\tPhase I activities should generate
scientific data confirming the clinical potential of the proposed
contrast agent. Some of the expected activities
are:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Reporting Systems for Dietary Images",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tCurrent dietary assessment
methods and systems largely depend on time and resource intensive
self-report and\/or recall methods. Accuracy of the assessment is often
compromised when diet is assessed via self-report because of the
cognitive challenges in recalling or reporting quantities, types, and
preparation of foods eaten. Dietary assessment methods that do not rely
solely on self-report and recall could enhance the accuracy and
efficiency of dietary intake data collection and contribute to improved
understanding of the diet-disease relationship. Technological and
analytic advances over the past decade have led to more objective
methods to assess dietary intake. Leading examples include sophisticated
 dietary image or short video capture devices, that may be housed on a
mobile phone platform and paired with speech recognition, text
interface, and\/or geospatial location. With the advent of electronic
medical records and the focus on the epidemic of obesity and related
co-morbidities, clinicians, researchers, and practitioners are
increasingly interested in using objective measures to monitor
patient\/participant behavior as a tool for chronic disease prevention
or management and health research.\n\n\tThe development of an easily
deployable architecture for image-based dietary data transfer, storage,
analysis, and reporting will support the potential to increase
understanding of the relationship between diet and cancer risk. However,
 software systems necessary to manage and analyze the rich media
collected by mobile sensors are currently limited. The complexity of
data management and analysis needed to provide image-based measures of
dietary intake presents a significant barrier to the integration of
these measures into clinical practice and trials, epidemiological
research, and behavioral monitoring applications. To overcome current
barriers and facilitate integration of image-based dietary measures into
 applications including electronic medical records and other health
information systems, contracts shall stimulate development of an easily
deployable architecture for data collection, transfer, storage,
analysis, and reporting of dietary intake.\n\n\tProject
objectivesinclude:\n\n\t1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Development of a mobile application to facilitate and control the
collection and transfer of dietary images or video, and any associated
information such as annotations, probes, or geospatial
location.\n\n\t2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Development of a standardized dietary rich media database architecture
and procedures to import and store data transferred from the mobile
application.\n\n\t3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Development of transparent and modifiable analytic tools that can
incorporate existing and evolving methods to generate individual and
group level dietaryintake measures from dietary images and associated
data.\n\n\t4)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Development of reporting systems to communicate outputs to
patients\/subjects, electronic medical records, health surveillance
systems, or researchers.\n\n\tProject Goals:\n\n\tThis topic addresses
the need to develop high throughput, efficient methods to standardize
collection, processing, and reporting of image-based dietary intake
measures, for use in clinical and research settings, and for case
management in prevention or treatment of chronic disease. This
topic&amp;rsquo;s goal is to encourage development of mobile
applications to facilitate and control the collection and transfer of
dietary rich media files; and paired systems for data importation,
storage, analyses, and output reporting of image-based dietary intake
measures. Required data elements include dietary images or short video
capture of consumed foods. Additional elements may include (but are not
limited to) speech recording and recognition, text interface, and\/or
geospatial location. The NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative
(GEI) Exposure Biology Program has supported development of technology
and analytic methods for image-based dietary assessment with relevance
to the current topic.\n\n\tAn essential task for each proposal is the
application or development of transparent and expandable analytic tools
to generate summary individual level dietary measures from collected
dietary rich media files. Data processing applications and analytic
tools may be drawn from established or emerging methods for dietary
image analysis research and practice. An expandable set of analytic
tools for processing image and supplemental dietary input data shall be
developed, including automated food item identification, quantity
estimation, and consumed volume reconstruction based on pre and
post-meal images\/video. Data processing and analytic tools must provide
 linkages to established nutrient databases including the USDA Food and
Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) and the USDA MyPyramid
Equivalents Database (MPED). Capacity to incorporate or expand to handle
 additional data is also encouraged, such as Global Positioning System
(GPS) location or linkage to the Gladson Nutrition Database which
includes Universal Product Code (UPC) data. Data linkages are required
within the Dietary Intake Summary Database to identify individual level
data characteristics based minimally on eating occasion or meal, day,
and week.\n\n\tProposals must demonstrate implementation or development
of data standards and capacity for sharing dietary summary measures via
output reporting systems. Recommended short term targets for dietary
outputs include ability to providereports to patients\/participants,
health systems, and researchers; with longer term targets to provide
reports directly to electronic medical records and public health
surveillance systems. Recommended reports are consistent with current
health outcomes policy priorities and objectives in the Meaningful Use
Matrix for electronic health records established by the Health
Information Technology Policy Committee (see
http:\/\/healthit.hhs.gov\/portal\/server.pt).\n\n\tPotential steps
within a developed systems data cycleare described
below:\n\n\t1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 A front end mobile application to facilitate and control dietary rich
media data collection and transfers is deployed to a user&amp;rsquo;s
smartphone.\n\n\t2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Usingthe front end mobile application, a user collects dietary image or
 short video files and system specific annotation options (such as
speech recognition, text interface, or probing options) and\/or
geospatial
location.\n\n\t3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Thefront end mobile application wirelessly transfers the collected data
 to the backend system for data management and

        "topic_name": "Development of Low Cost, Small Sample
Multi-Analyte Technologies for Cancer Diagnosis, Prognosis and Early
Detection ",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tCancer is recognized as a
multistep process involving multiple genomic and epigenomic alterations
that occur in multiple phases. The complexity of cancer requires
multivariate assays for accurate diagnosis, prognosis and treatment
monitoring. Recently, two multivariate gene-expression assays, Oncotype
DX and MammaPrint, have been developed for determining whether
chemotherapy is necessary for breast cancer. The Oncotype DX analyzes
the expression of a 21-gene signature by TaqMan RT-PCR. The MammaPrint
microarray which measures the expression of 70 breast cancer genes as a
signature, provides information about the likelihood of tumor recurrence
 and guides treatment.\n\n\tGiven the multivariate and heterogeneous
nature of the disease, it is likely that the early detection and
diagnosis of cancer will be based on multiple analytes. However, the
currently available clinical multi-analyte technology platforms have
many limitations, including the requirement of multiple biopsies and
special specimen collection\/storage process. Additionally, their
processes are often slow, complex, labor intensive and with sup-optimal
sensitivity. These factors contribute to the added cost which also
limits their broad applicability. For example the current list price of
both Oncotype DX and MammaPrint are over $4000 per sample.\n\n\tWhile
the various NIH and other Government (DOD, DARPA, NSF, NASA, USDA etc)
programs are developing new cutting edge technologies, their focuses are
 not on commercialization, and these novel technologies have not
penetrated into clinical use. This contract topic seeks to promote the
development of such innovations in early detection and diagnostic
technology to facilitate the commercialization of low cost, efficient
multi-analyte technologies with optimal sensitivity for cancer early
detection, diagnosis and prognosis. In particular, this topic requests
the development of technologies that can obtain multi-analyte molecular
information from small volume clinical specimens (e.g. core biopsy, fine
 needle aspiration, circulating tumor cells or FFPE sections). In
addition, this contract topic encourages proposals based on improving
both early detection and diagnosis of cancer from easily accessible
samples (e.g. blood, sputum, urine, fecal) with low abundant cancer
markers.\n\n\tProject Goals:\n\n\tThe short-term goal for the project is
 to develop working prototypes of low cost devices or methodologies for
multi-analyte analysis of small samples or easily accessible samples
with low abundant cancer biomarkers. Long-term goals are to improve
cancer early detection, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment monitoring by
 developing low cost, more efficient, and more sensitive devices or
methodologies for multi-analyte detection and analysis. Additionally,
this topic requests the development of technologies that can be used
with small volume, small numbers of cells or low cancer biomarker
abundant clinical specimens obtained through regular biopsy procedures
(e.g. core biopsy, FNA), surgery (e.g. FFER sections) or minimally
invasive methods (e.g. blood, sputum, urine, and fecal). The technology
should be innovative and make use of recent advances in areas such as
microfluidics, nanotechnology, multichannel imaging, and transducer
technologies for biosensors including optical, electrochemical,
piezoelectric, Field Effect Transistor, cantilevers or any other rapid
multi-analytes transducers. These devices and methodologies should be
more cost efficient than current ones (&amp;gt;5x cost reduction), have
significantly improved sensitivity\/specificity (&amp;gt;10x) and can be
 used with samples obtained from single core biopsy or FNA. Acceptable
devices and methodologies should be able to analyze at least 30 markers
(DNA, RNA, RNAi, or proteins) simultaneously within four hours. If the
innovation includes an integrated device, the cost of the market ready
device should be less than $15,000. Ideally, the input for the device
should be core biopsy, FNA or any small clinical biopsy specimen and the
 output should be the profile of the markers. This solicitation also
encourages developing non-invasive biomarker based technologies and
available multi-analyte technologies and assays for cancer early
detection.\n\n\tAccepted devices or methodologies include, but are not

Clinical and Research Settings (NIH Technology Transfer)",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe capacity to present
defined, pre-selected samples of archival tissue for immunohistochemical
 and in situ molecular analysis has revolutionized the development and
validation of tissue-based biomarkers in research and
clinicalapplication. In the clinical setting, most new diagnoses of
cancer use immunohistochemical assays of tissue samples to support the
diagnoses, and these immunohistochemical assays must be carefully
calibrated and validated. Tissue microarrays are the means for
validating the accuracy of these tissue diagnostic assays. Tissue
microarrays can present hundreds of tiny discs (range 0.6 to 3.0 mm) of
human or animal tissue specimens, arranged in a grid on a single
microscope slide. Currently available arraying tools are capable of
fabricating hundreds to thousands of copies of one such slide. Arraying
tools can be quite expensive (especially the automated tools) , complex,
 and require special training to operate and maintain quality. These
tools are therefore often beyond the resources of many laboratories that
 either have to settle for lower quality slides produced without
instrumentation, or purchase slides from manufacturers or specialty
labs. Thus, a need exists for a simple and inexpensive instrument for
fabricating tissue microarrays in clinical settings and research
laboratories.\n\n\tIn the research setting, a typical application of
tissue microarrays is the analysis of several hundred breast tumor
tissue samples from patients at different stages of disease development
(normal tissue, in situ cancer, invasive cancer, metastases) to identify
 the specific step at which biologic alterations take place, as well as
the frequency of these alterations. In another example, tissue
microarrays can be constructed from tissue materials in a retrospective
study design, where one can immediately correlate the expression of a
molecular marker with poor prognosis or response to therapy.
Furthermore, coupling with automated imaging platforms is possible, and
multiple different tumor types along with normal tissues can be screened
 simultaneously.\n\n\tResearchers at NCI have invented an instrument for
 manual construction of tissue microarrays that is projected to be more
accurate and less expensive than currently available. The invention
requires further proof of concept to establish reliability, accuracy,
and precision, and development of a fully functional prototype capable
of being manufactured in quantity.\n\n\tThis inventionis the subject of
issued U.S. Patent Number 7,854,899 and HHS Reference Number
E-098-2004\/0.\n\n\tProject Goals:\n\n\tThe preliminary goal of this
project is to develop a functional prototype capable of generating
tissue microarrays using the described methods. The final product will
be a modular system that will enable clinical and research
laboratoriesto construct tissue microarrays on a routine basis. The long
 term goal of this project is to bring to market this simplified,
low-cost instrument for tissue microarray construction to meet the needs
 and applications of researchers and clinicians as described
below.\n\n\tThis is an NIH TT (Technology Transfer) contract topic from
the NCI. This is a new program whereby inventions from the NCI

        "topic_name": "High Throughput Isolation of Antigen Specific
T-cells for Cancer Therapy (NIH Technology Transfer)",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe adoptive transfer of
autologous tumor reactive T lymphocytes (T cells) can mediate
significant tumor regression and long term cures in patients with
refractory metastatic cancer. Despite these important clinical findings,
 adoptive cell transfer has not become widely available for patient
treatment. Obtaining tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), T cells
associated with a tumor that can exhibit high tumor reactivity, usually
requires invasive surgery, which can lead to post-operative
complications and is not always possible for all patients depending upon
 the location of their tumors. A significant obstacle in extending this
promising therapy to a broader range of cancer patients has been the
availability of highly efficient in vitro methods to rapidly isolate and
 expand tumor reactive T cells from peripheral blood for therapeutic
use. Due to the low frequency of these T cells in the peripheral blood
of cancer patients, isolation of these cells has traditionally been a
difficult and laborious process requiring prolonged culture times and
large amounts of reagents and equipment. Furthermore, the T cells
typically generated during this protracted in vitro process develop
unfavorable traits making them unsuitable for cancer therapy.\n\n\tTo
overcome this significant challenge, intramural NIH investigators have
invented a novel high throughput in vitro platform using quantitative
RT-PCR (qPCR) as a functional screen to rapidly detect and isolate a
variety of low frequency tumor reactive T cell clones from the
peripheral blood of cancer patients (U.S. Patent Application No.
61\/027,623). This novel technology has allowed the investigators to
isolate and expand unique human T cells under GMP conditions that
otherwise would not have been feasible. The utility of these inventions
has been demonstrated by their application in isolating rare T cells and
 expanding them for human cancer therapy in an NCI sponsored clinical
trial (NCI 08-C-0104).\n\n\tThis invention is the subject of U.S. Patent
 Application Number 12\/866,919 and foreign counterparts in Europe and
Australia(HHS Reference Number
E-003-2008\/0).\n\n\tProjectGoals:\n\n\tThe ultimate goal of this
solicitation is to further refine and develop this novel T cell
isolation platform into a standardizedmanufacturing operating procedure
that could be commercialized for public and private use. The development
 of this technology would help overcome the fundamental obstacle of
isolating highly tumor reactive T cells that circulate at low
frequencies in the human body, which currently has prohibited the
widespread use of adoptive T cell therapies. A current approach to
obtain these low frequency tumor reactive T cells, such as TIL, from
cancer patients is to use invasive surgical procedures to resect tumor
and isolate TIL from the resected tumor. However, some tumors cannot be
resected without risking patient mortality. The development of this
current technology would provide patients with unresectable tumors
another option for isolation of therapeutic T cells. If successful, this
 technology could potentially become the standard for tumor reactive T
cell isolation and eliminate the need for the invasive surgical
approach. The second long term goal of this solicitation is the
development of novel applications for this T cell isolation platform,
such as extending its applicability to other cancers and other disease
indications. The awardee may have an opportunity to engage in
collaborative research with NCI&amp;rsquo;s researchers and benefit from
 current expertise in the field for preclinical development and the
clinical application of the technology.\n\n\tThis is an NIH TT

        "topic_name": "Generation and Qualification of Site-specific
Post-translationally Modified Proteins for Use as Calibrators in
Pharmacodynamic (PD) Assays",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tNCI is committed to
developing clinically useful biomarker tests that identify critical
molecular targets within a patient&amp;#39;s tumor, which can provide
drug sensitivity, resistance, and real-time response information. For
this SBIR topic, NCI requests that qualified small businesses submit
proposals to aid the development of robust, quantitative pharmacodynamic
 (PD) immunoassays. Specifically, this topic solicits proposals to
develop methods for the generation of stable, site-directed,
high-content (50-80%) post-translationally modified (e.g.,
phosphorylated) protein calibrators AND associated processes for
bench-top purification, characterization and qualification of these
protein calibrators\n\n\tApproximately 30% of proteins in eukaryotic
cells are subject to phosphorylation. This crucial post-translational
modification of proteins regulates numerous normal cellular events
including the cell cycle, differentiation, metabolism, and neuronal
communication. Likewise, dysregulated phosphorylation has been
implicated in the etiology of many diseases. Thus, pharmacodynamic (PD)
assays that directly detect and quantify phosphorylated proteins serve
as a means to assess the type and magnitude of the cellular response to
an external stimulus (i.e. cancer drugs). Given the important role
kinases play, it is critical for researchers to have quality tools: (1)
to generate stable post-translationally modified protein calibrators,
particularly phospho-proteins; (2) to accurately identify the
post-translationally modified sites; and (3) to quantify the level of
site-specifically modified protein residues. Such reference standards
are critically needed to serve as calibrators for absolute quantitation
in PD assays. Moreover, the NCI anticipates that a subset of the PD
assays that use these calibrators may ultimately be repurposed as
companion diagnostic assays for approved drugs.\n\n\tProducing
post-translationally modified proteins (e.g., phospho-proteins) is
currently imprecise involving chemical, enzymatic, and recombinant
techniques. For example, biological systems provide poor control over
site-directed phosphorylation and the percentage of phosphorylation at
each site. A detailed characterization of the sites of
post-translational modification is also difficult, with quantitation or
semi-quantitation of modified residues now being carried out by mass
spectrometry, fluorescence immunoassays, Microscale Thermophoresis
(MST), FRET, Time-Resolved Fluorescence (TRF), fluorescence
polarization, and ELISA. The development of technologies for producing
high quality, high content, and analytically verified
post-translationally modified proteins is becoming increasingly
important for the systematic analysis of complex cell signaling networks
 that drive normal and abnormal cellular function. Thus, there is a
great need to develop new approaches for quantitative generation and
characterization of post-translationally modified proteins, which could
encompass one or more of the methods above and be designed to be time-,
labor-, and money-saving.\n\n\tA primary roadblock in the development of
 robust, quantitative assays for the detection of post-translationally
modified proteins is the lack of well-defined turn-key processes for the
 production and characterization of purified proteins that are
quantitatively modified at particular amino acid residues but not
others. (Such reference standards are critically needed to serve as
calibrators.) Improving the quality of clinical grade assay development
for post-translationally modified proteins will require the development
of methods\/systems that allow the reproducible generation of stable
protein calibrators by directed and quantitative modification of certain
 residues (50-80% of the specified site), but not others (90-100% of the
 remaining sites should remain unmodified). Such methods and systems
should be capable of evaluating the effectiveness of the post
translational modification process, including an assessment of the
heterogeneity of the modifications generated. The method\/system should
also be capable of assessing the effectiveness of the purification
method(s), enabling both the detection of impurities and lot-to-lot
comparisons.\n\n\tThe focus of this topic is to use innovative,
state-of-the-art technologies to develop turn-key systems\/processes
that can provide assay-specific, stable post translationally modified
proteins with reasonable throughput and the analytic verificationof the
particular modified residue(s) and level of modification. The desired
outputs include reproducible production of post translationally modified
 protein calibrators, identification of the modified residue(s), 50-80%
modification of the specified sites, purity, yields, and possibly other
parameters (e.g., percent native vs. denatured protein). Easy-to-use,
on-demand, bench top generation and characterization processes\/systems
will be applicable to a broad range of medical and biomedical
applications in both academics and industry.\n\n\tThus, the overarching
goal of this topic is to extend capabilities for the NCI and the broader
 cancer community to generate robust, quantitative protein-based assays
to enable more efficacious, targeted therapeutic treatment of cancer
patients.\n\n\tProposals submitted under this topic should include a
detailed strategy\/plan to develop the appropriate methodology,
reagents, and instrumentation\/processes to produce stable,
high-content, site-specific, post-translationally-modified (e.g.,
phosphorylated) protein calibrators. Offerors submitting proposals under
 this topic are encouraged toconsider focusing on the production of
calibrators from the list of molecular targets below, which are of
particular interest to the NCI. However,proposals may focus on the
development of any protein target and\/or cancer-relevant
post-translational modification of clinical relevance to
cancer.\n\n\tProteins\/targets of particular interest to the
NCI:\n\n\tReceptor Tyrosine
Kinases\n\tMET\n\tRON\n\tEGFR\n\tALK\n\tIGF1R\n\n\tNon-Receptor Tyrosine
 Kinases\n\tSRC\n\tFAK\n\tJAK\n\tABL\n\tCSK\n\n\tProject goals:\n\n\tThe
 goal of the NCI SBIR program is to fund small businesses to develop
commercially viable products that advance the research and development
needs of the Institute and the broader cancer community. It is expected
that companies submitting proposals under this topic will execute and
extend their work to develop marketable instrumentation that enhances
the qualification of critical protein reagents for use in PD and other
types of diagnostic assays for cancer patients. The NCI Strategic Plan
identifies validating molecular targets for cancer prognosis,
metastasis, treatment response, and progression as a strategic priority
(Strategy 4.2). Part of this strategy includes creating a library of
validated molecular target assays to advance broad development of
targeted anti-tumor agents.Assay development encompasses the provision
of qualified critical protein reagents as capture and detection agents,
calibrators, or controls. One reason for the slow adoption of PD and
patient characterization assays is inconsistency in assay performance
between sites, and a primary cause of this performance variability is
the lack of qualified critical reagents. Market analysis indicates that
qualified critical reagents are essential for rapid clinical adoption of
 new assays, especially the initial &amp;ldquo;home-brew&amp;rdquo;
assays developed in CLIA-certified laboratories and in small
biotechnology companies without the financial means to contract out
reagent qualification. Development of technologies to include
methodologies and\/or prototype instrument systems for rapid, turn-key,
bench-top generation of qualified post-translationally modified (e.g.,
phospho-protein) calibrators will be a valuable step toward the eventual
 commercialization of diagnostic assays that target post-translationally
 modified proteins associated with disease or drug action.\n\n\tPhase I

        "topic_name": "Development of an Integrated Automated High
Throughput Platform for Large-Scale Genetic and Therapeutic Screening in
 Zebrafish",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tNon-mammalian models, such
as zebrafish, have emerged as powerful model organisms due to the
availability of a wide array of species-specific genetic techniques,
along with its short development time, fecundity and small size. For
zebrafish larvae, their small size and optical clarity allows the use of
 powerful optical techniques that enable precise cellular visualization
within the living animal, attributes that increase the ease of screening
 and allow screening on a large scale. Given the large number of
zebrafish mutant and transgenic lines expressing fluorescent proteins,
they can be utilized for large-scale chemical and therapeutic screens to
 identify lead compounds for drug discovery. Importantly, since the
approach does not depend upon the prior identification of a target, it
can be utilized to reveal novel insights and to dissect complex
molecular pathways.\n\n\tDespite the potential of the zebrafish for
small molecule screens, very few have been reported and involve limited
numbers of compounds. A key challenge has been the automated assessment
of phenotypes because there are few image analysis methods capable of
capturing the complexity of the whole organism. Additionally, throughput
 for zebrafish and other non-mammalian screens, for the most part, does
not nearly approach that of high throughput screening (HTS) in cell
culture systems. A principal hurdle to allowing more scientists to
perform HTS using zebrafish is centered on the development of technology
 for automated image acquisition and data analysis. Although fluorescent
 microscopes with automated stages that allow examination of zebrafish
embryos in microtiter plates have been developed, there are still many
obstacles that impede optical access (e.g., pigmentation and the highly
autofluorescent yolk sac), high-resolution image capture and
analysis.\n\n\tThis contract topic seeks to stimulate research and
development of a HTS automated system for imaging and analyzing
zebrafish embryos and larvae that will be available commercially as a
standardized, streamlined process, involving 2 or 3 pieces of equipment,
 requiring minimal laboratory space and that could be maintained and
operated efficiently by a single person. Ideally, most of the process
would be automated and all of the components listed below should be
integrated into a single unified platform. Short of complete integration
 of all aspects, priority will be given to integration for each of two
sub-groupings:\n\n\t1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Microfluidic platform for automated sorting of zebrafish embryos and
young larvae (e.g., mutant vs. wildtype) that will load directly into
the wells of a screening microplate, pipette test substances into
embryo-containing wells at appropriate final concentrations, allow for
incubation ideally at 28.5&amp;deg;C and other temperatures, retrieve
embryos from wells, read the signal in individual fish, and output data
into an Excel spreadsheet format. Such an automated system must be able
to distinguish between spurious maternal signal in the yolk and the
zygotic signal in different tissues. Several sized screening microplates
 should also be developed to accommodate different stage embryos (e.g.,
gastrula vs. pharyngula vs. young larvae) for orientation in a defined
orientation (e.g., lateral view) for image capture. If the embryo sorter
 can simultaneously genotype and score animals, it should be able to
detect fluorescence for green, yellow and red regions of the spectrum
and other numerous available
fluorophores.\n\n\t2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Image capture device for embryo high-throughput\/high-content
microscopy platform to quantify and report a comprehensive set of
features such as count, length, area, intensity, and width, as well as
general features about the embryo. The application should automatically
discard analysis if the embryo is not in an optimal condition (wrong
orientation, unhealthy, out-of-focus). Ideally, images of each embryo
should be taken at 2.5x magnification, from one field per embryo down to
 an appropriate organ-sized field, and capture a variable number of
optical sections (up to at least ten) through the embryo. The capturing
device should have software to automatically stitch images together and
score to exclude autofluoresce in the hatching gland and
yolk.\n\n\tProject goals:\n\n\tThe short-term goal of the project is to
perform proof-of-principle technical feasibility demonstration of an
automated system for sorting embryos and larvae, dispensing test
substances, imaging and analyzing zebrafish embryos and larvae. The
long-term goal of the project is the development of capabilities for
higher throughput assays with ability to automate scoring of a visible
marker or visible phenotype that will be available commercially as a
standardized, streamlined process.\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables:\n\n\tPhase I activities should support the technical
feasibility of the approach. Specific activities and deliverables during
 Phase I should

The technology provides the means to expand the iPS cell lines to the

represent an excellent substitute for improving upon cell-based assays

 Cellular Function",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tApproximately half of the 44
 cells that comprise the human respiratory tract still remain partially
identified and their function(s) is incompletely understood (Franks et.
al. Proc Am Thorac Soc 2008; 5: 763-6)). Suitable technologies are
available to identify, sort, purify, culture, and determine cell surface
 markers or other unique identifying features that permit individual
characterization of cell types. It seems feasible to unravel the origins
 and functional capabilities of lung cells involved in developmental
stages of lung growth and in disease. But it will be necessary to
generate new reagents that will identify these still incompletely
characterized cells in the human lung, permit establishment of cell
lines, and facilitate ready isolation from lung tissue.\n\n\tMuch is
known already about many important cells in the human respiratory tract,
 but little is known about the supportive function of structural cells,
the para-endocrine effect(s) of lung cells, and the location and
functions of stem and progenitor cells that remain quiescent until
stimulated to help repair tissue after injury or disease. Cellular
functions that suppress or create apoptosis to reestablish normalcy need
 insight. Several examples are offered representing the three main
compartments of the
lung:\n\n\t1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Among airway cells
 comprising the large and small airways of the human bronchial tree, the
 ciliated, columnar, secretory, and basal cells have been well studied,
but more knowledge about epithelial stem and progenitor cells along the
airways, mucus and ciliated cell interactions, functions of brush cells,
 and the stimuli from neuro-endocrine cells to affect integrity of the
epithelium, all are
needed.\n\n\t2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In the alveolus,
 information is considerable about Type I cells, the multiple tasks of
Type II cells, and surfactant production and properties, but Type II
cell stimulated epithelial to mesenchymal transition is evolving but is
not understood as a process leading to lung fibrosis, and the activity
of interstitially located fibroblasts to secrete extracellular matrix
needs more scrutiny.\n\n\t3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The
 vascular bed of the pulmonary circulation needs study of the
endothelial cells populating different locations and the capillary
network, and interactions of endothelium with smooth muscle cells and
with adventitial fibroblasts need examination.\n\n\tThus, special
reagents are needed for studying lung cell biology and cells involved in
 organ development, growth, and disease. Examples of needed reagents
include:\n\n\t1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Antibodies that
 will recognize specific cell types and permit separation and recovery
of cells from micro-dissected lung
tissue.\n\n\t2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Reagents to
identify proteomic products produced by
cells.\n\n\t3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Antibodies that
recognize cell surface markers that can help identify and track
different cell lineages present in airway and alveolar
structures.\n\n\t4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Specific
antibodies to recognize cell surface markers that help to separate out
individual cell types from among heterogeneous lung tissue
cells.\n\n\t5.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Reagents that
track cellular changes in differentiation as development occurs, track
cells that enter latency, and detect signals of re-stimulation or
redeployment for repair
tasks.\n\n\t6.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Reagents that
characterize and identify &amp;ldquo;stem&amp;rdquo; and progenitor lung
 cells.\n\n\tPhase I proposals should focus on development of reagents
that identify unique cell surface markers or other special structures
that would permit extraction of cells, considered to be incompletely
characterized or identified, from human lung tissue biopsy specimens, or
 other lung bio-specimens such as transbronchial biopsy and
bronchoalveolar lavage. This should lead to cell separation and
establishment of in vitro cell cultures.\n\n\tPhase II proposals should
focus on scale up production of unique reagents for cell separation that
 can be placed in a repository for use by other investigators by
application to investigate lung disease, and to study cell proteomics
and other functions.\n",

into the circulation contributes to morbidity and mortality in intense
hemolytic states such as sickle cell disease (SCD). Free hemoglobin
related vascular reactivity, potentially through nitric oxide scavenging
 and oxidative stress associated with the iron moiety of heme likely
result in pulmonary arterial hypertension, stroke and the acute chest
syndrome in SCD. A glucocorticoid induced increase in haptoglobin
synthesis in animal models has demonstrated an attenuation of the
adverse clinical effects of free hemoglobin. (J Clin Invest [2009]

 technical and scientific approach and demonstrate the feasibility of
manufacturing a human plasma derived haptoglobin concentrate that is

concentrate would be produced from plasma fractionation using
established methodologies (such as Cohn or Kistler\/Nitschmann methods)
that could support scale-up in production to clinically relevant
quantities.\n\n\tThe hypothesis to be tested in SBIR Phase II studies is
 that well-characterized, infused haptoglobin would complex with free
hemoglobin and accelerate its clearance by CD163 on macrophages. This
clearance should reduce the risk of altered vascular reactivity due to
nitric oxide binding and similarly, reduce oxidative tissue damage
mediated by heme iron. These possible effects will be tested in SBIR

        "topic_name": "Transmit-receive Surface Array Coils for MRI of
Patients with Internal Conductive Devices",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tMagnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) has the potential to guide non-surgical cardiovascular
interventional procedures because it can visualize soft tissue, guide
positioning of therapeutic devices, and assess treatment outcome, all
without ionizing radiation. To ensure that such procedures can be
carried out effectively and safely it is essential to have devices
(catheters, guidewires, etc.) that have the appropriate mechanical
properties and that are conspicuous (visible) on the MRI images. The
only general way to ensure conspicuity is by making the devices active,
i.e. by making the devices capable of receiving NMR signals.
Unfortunately, such devices (with conductive structures) can heat up
considerably in a standard MRI scanner and this is one of the current
major obstacles for MRI guided interventions.\n\n\tThe problem of
heating of conductive structures during MRI extends to other
applications such as imaging of patients with pacemakers and implantable
 defibrillators. A solution to this problem would have wide implications
 for the ability to scan a growing population of patients with implanted
 devices.\n\n\tIt has become clear that one of the key causes of active
device heating is electrical coupling between the main MRI scanner
transmit system (the body coil) and the devices. This coupling can be
eliminated (or greatly reduced) by using a surface coil transmit system,
 which uses much smaller transmission coils than the main body coil of
the scanner. There are two competing constraints that make it
challenging to implement such a solution: a) For this solution to be
effective the RF transmission system should illuminate the smallest
possible area needed to effectively guide the procedure, and b) It may
be necessary to follow devices over relatively large distances in the
body. To accommodate both of these constraints we envision a surface
coil transmit-receive array consisting of a relatively large number of
smaller coil elements (i.e. 32, or more elements) covering the entire
torso front and back (from the groin to the neck region). The system
should allow dynamic activation and deactivation of coil elements such
that only a subset of the transmit elements in the region of interest
are active at any given point in
time.\n\n\tSpecifications\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The coil array should cover the entire torso approximately 35 cm wide
by 60cm long and the area illuminated by the transmission system at any
given time should be controllable down to a size of 15x15
cm.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 It has to be possible to use the system with an MRI scanner without
parallel transmit capability, i.e. the system has to be driven by a
single RF waveform specified by the sequence. The system could include
additional amplifiers and control hardware and software as
needed.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 It should be possible to turn elements on and off dynamically. We
envision a programmable interface that can be controlled from the MRI
sequence
environment.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Ideally, it would be possible to control the phase of the RF pulse in
each individual transmit element. Element-by-element RF amplitude
control would also be desirable to enable dynamic RF shimming as needed
to accommodate different body shapes and also to mitigate device heating
 through more advanced
techniques.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Multiple receive elements (~16 elements) must be active within the
illuminated area to enable parallel imaging
acceleration.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The NHLBI currently uses 1.5T Siemens MRI systems and the proposed
transmit-receive system must be compatible with these scanners (more
details will be made available upon
request).\n\n\tDeliverables\n\n\tPhase I should aim to provide a working
 prototype system that would allow a) MRI imaging with sufficient image
quality to guide an interventional procedure , and b) comprehensive
heating testing with interventional devices developed at the NHLBI.
Heating test will be conducted in phantom and animal experiments at the
NIH in collaboration with on-site scientists.\n\n\tPhase II will
incorporate design changes based on Phase I testing and deliver a
complete transmit-receive system, which is safe for patient use.
Specifically, the device should be eligible for designation as a
&amp;ldquo;non-significant risk device&amp;rdquo; by FDA or the vendor

Exemption&amp;rdquo; from the FDA.\n",

        "topic_name": "Multilayer-coated Gratings for Phase-Contrast
Computed Tomography",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tIn the United States
computed tomography (CT) currently accounts for approximately 15% of all
 diagnostic imaging procedures. The number of CT scans has seen a
threefold increase in the two decades leading to 2007 due to its unique
capabilities. A CT scan produces high resolution, volumetric rendition
of internal organs in a short period. CT scanners are relatively compact
 and economic to operate and maintain. Thus, they are widely available
even in difficult environments. However, CT technology offers relatively
 low visibility (contrast) of soft tissue structures when compared to
magnetic resonance imaging, and at the cost of exposing the patient to
substantial ionizing radiation.\n\n\tIn the past few years there has
been intense development of the concept of phase-contrast CT, a
promising strategy to improve soft-tissue visibility and lower radiation
 dose by tenfold or higher over conventional absorption-based
technology. To translate the phase-contrast concept to clinical
applications, the technology must meet a number of requirements,
including the ability to work with compact x-ray tubes, fast imaging
speed and large field of view, and compact instrumentation. Full-field
imaging techniques that utilize x-ray transmission gratings are prime
candidates for eventual clinical applications due to their speed and
adaptability, but they have not delivered the theoretically possible
performance to-date. The main obstacle has been the inability to produce
 gratings of less than 1 micrometer periods for hard x-rays.\n\n\tA
promising technology to overcome the above limitation is vapor
deposition of alternating high and low atomic number layers with layer
thicknesses in the sub micrometer to nanometer range. The resulting
multilayer structure serves as transmission gratings of extremely small
periods when used in the transmission configuration. The concept has
been proven effective in x-ray focusing optics. An additional advantage
of this technology is that the grating depth-to-period ratio is
unlimited in principle, making it effective for hard x-rays employed in
animal and human CT. However, current multilayer x-ray transmission
optics are fabricated on smooth substrates, while phase-contrast CT
presents the need for deposition on patterned substrates in order to
achieve sufficient grating areas for CT scanners. Therefore, the aim of
this solicitation is to develop fabrication techniques of multilayer
structures on patterned substrates to effect large-area, hard x-ray
transmission gratings.\n\n\tSpecifications\n\n\tThis solicitation
encourages the development of a directional deposition technology of
multilayers of alternating high and low atomic number materials on
periodic echelle (staircase like) substrates to form large-area x-ray
gratings. Deposition rates of 200 nanometer per minute or higher are
desired to permit total multilayer thicknesses of tens of micrometers in
 reasonable deposition time. The packing density of the layers should
approach bulk materials for the purpose of effectively modulating the
intensity and phase of hard x-rays used in animal and human CT scanners.
 The thickness and geometry of individual layers should be precisely
controlled and uniform over the desired grating area. The directionality
 of the technology should be sufficient to target specific surfaces of
the patterned substrates while avoiding deposition on other surfaces.
Deposition protocols for material pairings of tungsten\/silicon,
chromium\/silicon and titanium\/silicon should be developed. Proper
adhesion of the multilayer structure to the substrate should be achieved
 without spontaneous delamination. Individual layer thicknesses of
approximately 50 nanometers and structurally uniform coated areas of
60mm x 60mm should be developed for small animal CT at 35 keV.
Ultimately the technology should be extended to large area gratings for
human CT scanners at 60 &amp;ndash; 100
keV.\n\n\tDeliverables\n\n\tPhase I proposals should focus on the
development of multilayer deposition technology of material pairings of
tungsten\/silicon for absorption gratings and chromium\/silicon and
titanium\/silicon for phase gratings. The targeted x-ray energy is 35
keV for small animal CT scanners. The proposals should aim to achieve
individual layer thicknesses of 50 nanometers, total deposition
thickness of up to 100 micrometers, and structurally uniform coated
areas of 60 mm x 60 mm. Techniques should be developed to selectively
deposit on specific facets of the patterned substrate while minimizing
material deposition on other surfaces. The substrates for coating tests
will be provided by Division of Intramural Research, National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health
(DIR\/NHLBI\/NIH). The proposals should also include evaluation of the
multilayer structures with cross-sectional electron microscopy either
independently by the contractor or with the help of
DIR\/NHLBI\/NIH.\n\n\tPhase II effort should focus on scaling up the
technology developed in Phase I to larger grating areas and total
deposition thicknesses of over 100 micrometers for human computed
tomography.\n",

MRI Ablation of Ventricular Tachycardia",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tCatheter-based ablation
therapy is used to treat cardiac rhythm disorders. MRI may have value in
 targeting and assessing ablation lesions interactively during catheter
based cardiac electrophysiology (EP) procedures. Real-time MRI EP
ablation may be especially attractive to ablate mid-myocardial targets
causing ventricular tachycardia in adults and children.\n\n\tWhile
technically feasible, there are no commercially available flexible
catheter devices to perform EP ablation that are conspicuous and safe
under real-time MRI guidance. Such technology, if commercialized, would
enable novel treatments for ventricular
tachycardia.\n\n\tSpecifications\n\n\tThe offering resembles a
&amp;ldquo;conventional&amp;rdquo; deflectable multipolar catheter used
to perform EP ablation procedures in geometry and in mechanical
performance. These must be specified.\n\n\tThe offering must be
conspicuous during MRI at 1.5T using &amp;ldquo;profiling&amp;rdquo;
techniques such that positive contrast is provided along the entire
intravascular device shaft and tip. The preferred catheter design for
profiling is &amp;ldquo;active&amp;rdquo; such that the offering
incorporates an intravascular MRI coil that allows the device and tissue
 to be imaged simultaneously. Alternative designs will be considered
that provide high conspicuity during MRI.\n\n\tThe device must be able
to obtain multi-channel local intracardiac electrograms. Suitable
filtering functionality must be provided to connect the system to a
commercial clinical EP recording and mapping system.\n\n\tThe device
should be suitable for transcatheter endocardial application and for
transthoracic intrapericardial epicardial application.\n\n\tThe device
must be capable of radiofrequency ablation of ventricular myocardium
during uninterrupted magnetic resonance imaging, which may require
appropriate filtering. Alternative ablative energy sources may be
proposed. Saline irrigation, or alternative target tissue cooling,
should be integrated into the ablation system.\n\n\tThe device should
interoperate during MRI with at least two other similar catheters that
provide multipolar electrogram recording capability.\n\n\tThe offeror
should consider capabilities to perform ventricular defibrillation in
the MRI environment. The offering should operate with the interventional
 MRI system of the sponsoring NHLBI laboratory. The NHLBI currently uses
 1.5T Siemens MRI systems and the proposed transmit-receive system must
be compatible with these scanners (more details will be made available
upon request). The offering must be &amp;ldquo;MRI safe&amp;rdquo; or
&amp;ldquo;MRI contingent&amp;rdquo; to allow future clinical
procedures, without heating or local magnetic field disruption according
 to accepted industry standards and should be designed for safety in a
clinical environment. Control of the system should be possible from a
bedside operator and from a console-based operator outside the
radiofrequency MRI system shield. The system should not generate
radiofrequency noise that interferes with MRI at 1.5T. The system should
 be safe for operators and patients inside and near the magnet bores.
The system should not interfere with common commercial Bluetooth and
other common radiofrequency patient physiologic telemetry systems used
during MRI.\n\n\tDeliverables\n\n\tAt the conclusion of Phase I, a
candidate device design should be selected for clinical development
based on in vivo performance of a mature prototype system nearing final
design lock.\n\n\tAt the conclusion of Phase II, the offeror should
obtain an investigational device exemption (IDE), and a supply of

Use Disorders",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tEfforts to develop
medications for alcohol use disorders have expanded rapidly in recent
years. Developing novel compounds for alcohol treatment is high priority
 for NIAAA Medications Development Program. Three agents directed at the
 addictive behavior in the use of alcohol &amp;mdash;disulfiram,
naltrexone, and acamprosate&amp;mdash;are now approved for use in the
United States and many other countries. Recently, topiramate has also
been shown to be effective in treating alcohol-dependent patients.
Still, these medications do not work for everyone. Because of this,
further research is ongoing to develop more alcohol medications, perhaps
 producing medications that are more effective or at the very least,
providing more choices for patients, similar to the situation for the
treatment of depression with multiple antidepressants.\n\n\tDuring the
past decade, many new targets in the brain and liver have evolved that
alter alcohol-seeking and drinking behavior. Brain effects and behavior
may be influenced by agents directed at CRH1, adrenergic, opioid kappa,
vasopressin V1b, NK1, orexin, NPY, NOP, glutamate mGluR2\/3, mGluR5,
GABAa &amp;alpha;-1 and &amp;alpha;-5 receptors. Several intracellular
targets in additional (peripheral) organs have also been identified that
 alter outcomes of chronic alcohol use, including ALDH-2; PKC; PPARg;
epigenetic modulators, (HDAC inhibitors, methylases, demethylases, and
microRNAs); rapamycin complex 1; and GDNF. Tissue damage induced by the
influence of alcohol or acetaldehyde on any of the above have serious
negative consequences including development of steatohepatitis,
cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n\tSpecific areas of research
include high-throughput screening for novel compounds, drug
optimization, efficacy testing, GMP manufacturing, formulation,
pharmacokinetic testing, and IND-directed animal toxicology. Any one of
the following examples represents an area of interest to NIAAA but
proposals are not limited to the examples
given:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

the multiple downstream negative consequences of alcohol
use.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Develop medications to reduce smoking in alcohol-abusing
individuals.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Develop novel medications to treat alcohol-induced organ damage by
attenuating or reversing the tissue damage. Identifying new targets for
drug development based on mechanisms underlying the alcohol-induced
damage is
encouraged.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Hormone Receptor Agonist for Thyroid Cancer (NIH TT)",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tNIDDK investigators have
discovered and are evaluating the first potent and efficacious small
molecule agonist of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin)
receptor (TSHR) that has potential for clinical application in patients
with thyroid cancer. This agonist drug is intended for use in patients
for 2-5 days at a time following thyroidectomy and at subsequent
intervals after initial treatment, when radioactive iodine screening is
performed to detect the presence of remaining thyroid cancer
cells.\n\n\tSmall molecule agonists and antagonists for G
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) make up approximately 40% of the drugs
 currently in clinical use. The TSHR is a GPCR. The investigators have
shown that this compound is active in model cell systems over-expressing
 TSHRs, in &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; human thyroid cells (thyrocytes)
 in primary culture and, perhaps most importantly, after oral
administration in mice to increase iodide uptake in the thyroid gland,
similar to the protocol used for administration of recombinant human TSH
 (rhTSH, Thyrogen&amp;reg;, Genzyme Corporation) to patients with
thyroid cancer. The ultimate goal is to see that an easily produced,
orally administered, safe and effective drug is developed, launched, and
 used as an alternative to rhTSH in patients with thyroid cancer
world-wide.\n\n\tThis invention is the subject of PCT Application No.
PCT\/US2008\/011958, U.S. Application No. 13\/125,045, and foreign
counterpartsin Europe, Japan, India, Canada and Australia (HHS Reference
 Number E-284-2008\/0).\n\n\tProject Goals:\n\n\tThe goal of the project
 is to obtain a full characterization of the small molecule TSHR agonist
 to support the filing of an IND application. The investigators have
completed optimization for potency and selectivity using in vitro cAMP
assays, have performed an SAR with the scaffold, have shown that one of
the lead compounds is effective after oral administration in mice and
have had 1 gram of a highly purified, active preparation of the compound
 synthesized. The investigators have recently determined the half-life
in mouse plasma, the protein binding in mouse plasma and the degradation
 of the agonist by mouse liver microsomes. The investigators propose
performing the following prior to the beginning of this contract:
identification of the major metabolites and determination of their
activities; pharmacokinetics in mice after intravenous, intraperitoneal
and oral dosing of the parent compound and the major metabolite with
measurements of their tissue concentrations; activity measurements in
mice (including the major metabolite) with efficacy testing; and
pharmacology in mice including cardiac, pulmonary and neurologic (hot
plate) testing.\n\n\tDuring the contract period the following will be
performed in rats and dogs: determine pharmacokinetics and
bioavailability; dose range finding; genetic toxicology; safety
pharmacology; toxicology studies; and histology\/pathology assessments.
NIDDK will schedule a pre-IND meeting with the FDA and begin work on a
formulation for administration to humans. If funded, we do not envision
any roadblocks to accomplishing these steps.\n\n\tThis is an NIH TT

that proposals adhere to the above budget amounts and project periods.
Proposals with budgets exceeding the above amounts and project periods
may not be funded.\n\n\tAssessing the results of clinical investigations
 of pharmacotherapies for treating drug abuse is made difficult by the
lack of certainty that patients have taken the prescribed treatment as
instructed. Negative outcomes of trials of pharmacotherapies might be
due to the failure of patients to comply with the treatment. The
outcomes of clinical trials are then uncertain, damaging the reliability
 of expensive clinical testing. Traditional bioassays (urinalyses of
drug metabolites) are time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, NIDA
seeks an accurate method\/technology of compliance monitoring that is
less expensive than bioassays and delivers monitoring results in a
timely manner.\n\n\tThe technologies\/products should allow patients to

        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tAddiction to cocaine is a
serious health problem in the U.S. (currently estimated by the U.S.
Office of National Drug Control Policy at 3 million individuals).
Untreated cocaine dependence significantly increases health, social
service, and criminal justice costs to society and is a major vector
contributing to the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV, TB, and
hepatitis. To date, there is no FDA approved medication for the
treatment of cocaine dependence. Responding to the need for effective
therapies, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) supports research
 and development activities regarding the preclinical and clinical
aspects of pharmacotherapies for the treatment of cocaine
dependence.\n\n\tOne of the candidate drugs to treat cocaine dependence
is the mGluR5 antagonist fenobam. It is postulated that fenobam may be
useful in the treatment of cocaine addiction because mGluR5 antagonists
have been shown to affect four cocaine-induced processes thought to be
important in the development of, and relapse to, cocaine addiction: 1)
decrease in cocaine self-administration in rodents and in monkeys; 2)
blockade of cocaine-cue induced drug seeking behavior; 3) blockade of
cocaine-primed reinstatement in an animal model of cocaine
self-administration; and 4) blockade of the acquisition of cocaine place
 preference in rodents. In addition, mGluR5 antagonists have shown
efficacy in animal models of the same processes related to
nicotine.\n\n\tNIDA is planning to test fenobam for safety and efficacy
in the treatment of cocaine dependence. As fenobam is an investigational
 compound which has not yet been approved for marketing in the United
States, the development and manufacture of an appropriate oral dosage
form of fenobam will be undertaken by NIDA. NIDA is, therefore,
soliciting proposals for a SBIR contract for the development and
manufacture of a solid oral dosage form (tablets or capsules) of fenobam

 Phases I\/II clinical studies for the treatment of cocaine dependency.

Game for Substance Abuse via a Commercially Available Active &amp;amp;
Interactive Gaming Platform (e.g., Wii, Play Station Move, or Xbox
Kinect)",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tIt is strongly suggested
that proposals adhere to the above budget amounts and project periods.
Proposals with budgets exceeding the above amounts and project periods
may not be funded.\n\n\tObjective: This topic addresses the need for
addiction treatment improvement by further developing and expanding an
evidence-based therapy for use with in-treatment addicted populations
through development of a commercializable and compelling game to be
played over an &amp;ldquo;off- the- shelf&amp;rdquo; commercially
available gaming system that can sense and be controlled through user
body motions. Examples of systems at the time of this writing eligible
for inclusion are the Nintendo Wii, the Sony Playstation Move and the
Microsoft Xbox Kinect. The project will involve programming a
&amp;ldquo;seek and destroy&amp;rdquo;- type of virtual interactive
active game where patients find and use a variety of fun body movements
over a natural user interface to eradicate virtual drugs, alcohol, and
or cigarettes and related stimuli. The project may, depending on the
console selected, also involve development of peripherals for use with
the system.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tRecent research by Girard et al (2009)
has shown that 4 sessions performing behaviors, incompatible with
smoking cigarettes (crushing virtual cigarettes), within a virtual
environment was more efficacious for smoking cessation than a similar
game in which patients found and crushed virtual balls. The mechanism of
 this treatment is not well understood and it may be a form of
extinction, counter conditioning, exposure with response prevention, or
re-evaluative conditioning. Nonetheless, such virtual practice in a
&amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; environment may be uniquely helpful because
it can deliver a large &amp;ldquo;dose&amp;rdquo; of alternative
practice in a manner that people not just tolerate but also enjoy. The
fact Girard et al&amp;rsquo;s short duration gaming experience could
improve outcomes in comparison with a &amp;ldquo;placebo&amp;rdquo;
control suggests that games which involve the body in alternative
practice may hold great promise for treating addiction.\n\n\tActive,
interactive videogames (AIVs) utilizing movement sensitive gaming
consoles such as the Nintendo Wii, the Playstation Move, and the Xbox
Kinect offer the opportunity for a substance abusers or smokers to put
his\/her entire body into the process of creating new sense memories
with respect to substance-related cues. The opportunity to practice not
responding automatically to such cues along with the opportunity to use
many different muscle groups has potential to create new brain patterns
that may disrupt old automatic behavior and emotional patterns and
ultimately reduce relapse.\n\n\tIn addition to enhancing treatment
effects for addiction and smoking cessation, AIVs may also be a form of
health promotion to the extent that they get participants exercising. A
prime barrier to smoking cessation attempts is fear of weight gain. An
AIV-based treatment that increases large muscle group movement, thereby
increasing metabolism and thereby reducing weight gain in smokers afraid
 to quit because of fears of weight gain is a further selling point for
such a system.\n\n\tOne of the biggest challenges with both addiction
and smoking cessation treatment is getting people to try existing
treatments. Research indicates that many smoking quit attempts proceed
without treatment, and less than 6% of quitters try both behavioral and
medication treatment despite availability of recommended by experts
approaches. Addiction treatment utilization is poor as well with the
majority of substance dependent people never accessing treatment. Novel
treatments that appeal to people to enter and re-enter treatment and to
stay in while enrolled may have dual benefits from both their own unique
 mechanism of action as well as by boosting exposure to the benefits of
traditional treatment. Research has shown that tangible incentives
improve outcomes of traditional treatments but they have been criticized
 for a lack of practicality and sustainability. It may be possible to
use access to a novel treatment such as a videogame similarly, as an
incentive for participating in or using a traditional treatment. The
following scientific opportunity involves creating a highly engaging
game which may have independent treatment effects and which when used in
 conjunction with traditional addiction and\/or smoking treatment may
help improve treatment engagement to leverage traditional treatment
benefits.\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Modification of an existing game or development of a new therapeutic
game for Wii, Move or Kinect, in which one or several participants hunt
for and destroy virtual drug, alcohol, and\/or smoking stimuli and
paraphernalia using bodily movements sensed and recorded by the
game;\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Development of peripherals for to interact with the game as
needed;\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The game should include the opportunity for patients to select the
substances that are most relevant to them or allow them to play a
&amp;ldquo;multi-drug version&amp;rdquo; of the game if they need to
address multiple substance
use;\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The game should make use of a variety of body movements (e.g.,
stomping, shooting, batting, hurling, squashing etc&amp;hellip;) to
enable the participant to &amp;ldquo;virtually&amp;rdquo; destroy target
 substances as a way to &amp;ldquo;get clean&amp;rdquo; or win the war
on their
substance(s);\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The game should offer a variety of environments similar to those where
addictive substances are used (urban neighborhood, bar, party), in which
 the patient can practice refusal skills as well as opposing
practice;\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The game should include a variety of difficulty levels of increasing
intensity and allow for up to 4 hours of
gameplay;\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The game may include challenges in which participants refine skills for
 example, tossing the drug accurately into a trash receptacle that
becomes smaller at each level, or kicking them through a
goal;\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The game should be themed to pit the patient&amp;rsquo;s avatar who is
the hero or &amp;ldquo;recovery warrior&amp;rdquo; against the substance
 of
abuse;\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The patient&amp;rsquo;s avatar should be customizable to produce a
likeness similar to the patient so he\/she can name and view the avatar
as him\/herself; gender, height age, facial characteristics, race are
some of the desirable customizable
features;\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The game should be able to recognize and keep track of the
patient&amp;rsquo;s performance over time so the patient can experience
improvement in gameplay with each episode of
practice;\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The game should record, store, and provide for downloading into a
database, information regarding system use by each player such as time
played, repetitions of behaviors and types of behaviors used to
determine the extent of adherence and the &amp;ldquo;dose&amp;rdquo;
required;\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The game may also allow participants to practice of drug refusal skills
 when faced with virtual drug offers; in games with this feature,
virtual offerors should be responsive to the &amp;ldquo;recovery
hero&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; actual body posture, gaze and physical or
verbal responses and these should be displayed by the hero and offeror
avatars within the virtual
game;\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The game may allow for cooperation and interaction with other recovery
warriors when the game is played as a group
exercise;\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 A pilot study with a group of adult substance users in treatment
(N=9).\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The study will expose patients newly
enrolled in treatment to the game weekly for 30 minutes a session, for 4
 weeks.\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Measures collected at baseline will
include weight, drugs of choice, and timeline
follow-back.\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Measures collected following
each game exposure session will include acceptability, suggestions for
improvement, AES\/SAES craving ratings, urine drug screening and
cotinine screening (for smokers) and treatment engagement
data.\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Measures collected 1 month after
treatment entry will include timeline
follow-back.\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The pilot testing may be done in
 an iterative fashion so that multiple small focus groups are exposed to
 the program and it is modified in response to their
comments.\n\n\tPhase II Activities and Expected
Deliverables:\n\n\tModification of a program, developed in Phase I, in
response to customer feedback followed by an RCT Pilot clinical study
evaluating the effectiveness of the Recovery Warrior Game. Outcomes
collected will include AES, SAEs, treatment engagement information from
clinic records, system use information (durations, movements repeated,
times accessed) initial abstinence and\/or smoking cessation rates via
urine screening, smoking quit attempts, and weight changes.\n",

        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe project objective is to
deliver non-viral RNAi vectors to the cytoplasm of a cell type in the
brain after systemic administration. Thus, the non-viral shRNAi vector
must efficiently cross the blood barrier and efficiently deliver shRNAi
to the desired cell type within the brain. After delivery to the target
cell, shRNAi must efficiently escape from the endosome into the
cytoplasm. The non-viral vector complexed with shRNAi should show no
toxicity. Ultimately, the technology developed here will not only be
applicable to the treatment of substance use disorder but to other brain
 diseases as well.\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected

Deliverables:\n\n\tPhase II studies will apply the delivery system
created in Phase I to a potential therapeutic target for the treatment
for substance use disorders.\n\n\tFor example, changes in G protein
signaling have been shown to mediate addiction and relapse of drug
seeking behavior. AGS3\/GPSM1 activator of G protein signaling in the
prefrontal cortex and core of the nucleus accumbens is upregulated
during withdrawal following chronic administration of cocaine and
heroin. The upregulation of AGS3\/GPSM1 increases the amount of
AGS3\/GPSM1 binding to Gi&amp;alpha; and decreases the amount of
Gi&amp;alpha; ?to interact with the &amp;beta;&amp;gamma;? G proteins
subunits, resulting in sustained ligand-activation of receptors coupled
to &amp;beta;&amp;gamma;? G proteins subunits such as mGluR2\/mGLuR3,
the DRD2 receptor, and the A2 adenosine receptor. Injection of an
AGS3\/GPSM1 peptide into the prefrontal cortex produced a cocaine
sensitized phenotype manifested by enhance locomotor response to acute
administration of cocaine. Injection of anti-sense AGS3\/GPSM1
oligonucleotides prevented sensitization to cocaine and inhibited
cocaine priming of drug seeking behavior by normalizing AGS3\/GPSM1
protein levels. Injection of anti-sense AGS3\/GPSM1 oligonucleotides
into the core but not the shell of the nucleus accumbens also blocked
reinstatement of heroin and ethanol seeking behavior. The discovery of
the process of RNA interference (RNAi) makes AGS3\/GPSM1 a potentially
therapeutic target for the treatment for substance use
disorders.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Implement a strategy to demonstrate that in vivo systemic
administration of a non-viral shRNAi vector against AGS3\/GPSM1

Therapeutics for Treatment of HIV and HCV Infections in Drug Abusing
Populations",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tIt is strongly suggested
that proposals adhere to the above budget amounts and project periods.
Proposals with budgets exceeding the above amounts and project periods
may not be funded.\n\n\tTransmission between injection drug users (IDUs)
 is a major cause for HIV infection, accounting for around 25% of HIV
new case. Highly active anti-viral treatment (HAART) is an effective
treatment for HIV infection, and probably also effective in lowering the
 chance of HIV transmission among IDUs. However, poor adherence to
lifelong HAART treatments, especially among IDUs, long-term side
effects, and other factors dampen the effectiveness of chronic HAART. In
 addition, the therapy cannot eradicate the latent, low-level HIV
reservoirs in patents.\n\n\tWhen HAART is withdrawn from a patient,
rapid HIV rebound occurs quickly. It is currently believed that a
shorter-term, non-lifelong treatment that can achieve drug-free
remission should be the new goal of HIV treatment. Patients with this
type of treatment eliminate completely HIV completely from reservoirs in
 the body and would therefore alleviate the associated risk of spreading
 HIV through shared needles amongst IDUs.\n\n\tLentiviral-based gene
therapy represents an optimal short-term treatment option that would
eliminate all HIV viruses from the body. Whereas several research
groups\/companies have employed this strategy to deliver multiple
small-hairpin RNA (shRNA)\/therapeutic components, all of them use ex
vivo delivery methods and there is evidence that this approach does not
eradicate the latent HIV reservoirs in patents.\n\n\tNew strategies such
 as in vivo delivery of Lentiviral-based multiple highly-potent
small-interfering RNA (siRNA) and naturally-enveloped proteins of HIV
could be developed to effectively treat more effectively HIV-infected
IDUs especially those with latent reservoirs.\n\n\tThe burden of HIV and
 hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection is quite significant. In the
United States, 15-30% of subjects infected with HIV are co-infected with
 HCV. Thus, NIDA also seeks the development of microRNA clusters
designed to simultaneously inhibit several steps of the HCV cell cycle
by specifically targeting various segments of the HCV gene as well as
host cell companion proteins. This &amp;ldquo;cluster attack&amp;rdquo;
on the HCV genome may particularly benefit human subjects who are
co-infected with HIV and HCV because of the more severe nature of their
disease and their more limited therapeutic choices. Combinatorial
therapies, based on miRNAs, delivered via lentiviral vectors, may
overcome the genetic barrier of concomitant and frequent HCV mutations.
For example, the microRNA-mediated IFN-mimetic effect on the HCV cell
cycle may deliver the on-target effects of IFN in the liver while
avoiding the off-target effects of IFN in other tissues and
organs.\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected

that proposals adhere to the above budget amounts and project periods.
Proposals with budgets exceeding the above amounts and project periods
may not be funded.\n\n\tA need exists to understand the genetic bases of
 tobacco addiction and related disorders. Advances in research supported
 by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and other NIH
Institutes have identified several thousand genetic variants related to
tobacco dependence. Given that genetic variants identified through these
 research programs, the research community is poised to take advantage
of genetic technology that would allow researchers to use a single
uniform platform for screening genetic variants related to substance
abuse, and more specifically to tobacco dependence and related
disorders.\n\n\tThe technology exists to develop a customized
&amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo; Smokescreen to screen thousands of
an individual&amp;rsquo;s genetic variants at once. Development of this
Smokescreen for tobacco dependence and related diseases would advance
the understanding of the (1) genetic vulnerability to tobacco
dependence, (2) gene variants related to co-morbidity, including risk
and\/or treatment approaches for other addictive and psychiatric
disorders, peripheral artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, and lung cancer, and (3) genetic profile of the patients for
targeted treatments (i.e., pharmacogenetic approach).\n\n\tMajor
limitations to studying how these genetic variations may be incorporated
 into personalized approaches for smoking cessation in the clinic
include: 1) the small numbers of samples available from participants who
 have participated in clinical trials studying medications for treating
tobacco addiction, 2) the lack of a universal and validated screening
tool for data collection, and 3) the lack of a centralized database for
storing and analyzing the information into usable knowledge that
clinicians and researchers studying tobacco addictions, its treatments
and its consequences would reference.\n\n\tThis SBIR contract
solicitation provides an opportunity to address these limitations. NIDA
has identified a set of genetic variants that will allow the development
 of a uniform set of genetic variants to be screened. The overall goal
is to encourage eligible small businesses to develop a genetic screening
 tool to profile specified genetic markers that may be related to
smoking dependence and to smoking treatment, taking into consideration
that the profiles of dependent smokers may be different than profiles of
 smokers responding to treatments for cessation. NIDA has established a
prioritized set of genetic markers for developing the Smokescreen as
described in:
https:\/\/nidagenetics.org\/neurosnp\/neurosnp_about.html.\n\n\tIn order
 to collect clinical data for tobacco dependence and smoking cessation, a
 universal genetic &amp;ldquo;Smokescreen&amp;rdquo; is needed as a
research tool for use in a wide variety of clinical settings, such as
clinical trials, community treatment programs for smoking cessation,
clinics specializing in tobacco additions, and researchers studying
tobacco addictions, medications for cessation, and consequences of
tobacco addiction.\n\n\tA single genotyping or sequencing based platform
 for the genetic &amp;ldquo;Smokescreen&amp;rdquo; will be enriched for
candidate SNPs\/genetic regions that will provide a fourfold benefit to
the clinical and scientific community: i) It will enable researchers to
more accurately and reproducibly compare genetic variant data across
studies; ii) it will provide a more focused and targeted SNP analysis
that leverages existing knowledge; iii) it will be enriched with SNPs
and\/or targeted genetic regions from multiple ethnicities to allow for
allele frequency differences and rare variations across populations, and
 iv) it will provide a resource for developing personalized approaches
to pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation treatments and possibly other
 related co-morbidities, including risk and\/or treatment approaches for
 other addictive and psychiatric disorders, peripheral artery disease,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer.\n\n\tThe
Smokescreen will provide patients and physicians with more information
about the prospects for the smoking dependence risk (and possibly the
other co-morbidities listed above) and it will support treatment
decisions. The Smokescreen is envisioned to be used in conjunction with a
 nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) test, as the NMR will likely be a
better measure of smoking dependence. However, the Smokescreen may
provide additional data for targeting cessation therapies by profiling
or stratifying participants in clinical trials for smoking cessation
medications, and may also be helpful for determining risk of potential
consequences of heavy smoking, such as lung disorders and lung
cancers.\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables\n\n\tPrototype the Smokescreen for use in basic and
clinical research settings with the most recent genetic technology
available and using the prioritized genetic variants recommended by NIDA

Prevent Opiate Overdose Deaths ",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tIt is strongly suggested
that proposals adhere to the above budget amounts and project periods.
Proposals with budgets exceeding the above amounts and project periods
may not be funded.\n\n\tDrug overdose is currently the second leading
cause of unintentional death in the United States, second only to motor
vehicles crashes. The population at risk for opioid overdose is diverse
and includes, for example, more than 3% of U.S. adults currently
receiving long-term opioid therapy for chronic noncancer pain, in
addition to drug\/substance abusing population. Opioids are now more
often being prescribed for patients with moderate to severe
pain.\n\n\tThus, effective measures that would prevent\/avert opioid
overdoses are needed as overdoses and death often occur inadvertently in
 private settings where no one is present to offer assistance.
Furthermore, patients with opioid addiction are prone to overdose on
injected opiates or on excessive oral doses of opioid medications. These
 overdoses also often happen when no help is available and
patient&amp;rsquo;s lives are at risk.\n\n\tThe objective of this
project is to develop an automated device that would administer standard
 doses of naloxone to a patient in overdose, thus reversing the effects
of excess opiate. Naloxone has been used for decades in medical settings
 to avert opioid overdose, and recent pilot programs demonstrated the
feasibility of proper use of naloxone by non-medical personnel. Patients
 expressing physiologic signals of opiate overdose (e.g. hypoxia,
respiratory rate below a critical threshold for a critical period of
time, etc.) could be administered an appropriate dose of naloxone even
if unconscious. Due to the short duration of action of naloxone, the
unit should be capable of repeating the injection after resetting itself
 and detecting another set of critical information.\n\n\tThere are more
than 300,000 heroin users, nearly 5 million prescription opiate users,
plus millions of chronic pain patients receiving end-of-life opiate
analgesic pain care. The number of poisoning deaths and the percentage
of these deaths involving opioid analgesics increase each year. From
1999 through 2006, the number of fatal poisonings involving opioid
analgesics more than tripled from 4,000 to 13,800 deaths. Potentially,
everyone who has been prescribed opioids, for pain or addiction, and
heroin users, could be offered this device by their treatment provider
who may be an addiction specialist, primary care physician or pain
doctor. There is a crucial need to provide this device to these
populations to prevent unintended overdose and deaths and to address
public health need.\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected

        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tIt is strongly suggested
that proposals adhere to the above budget amounts and project periods.
Proposals with budgets exceeding the above amounts and project periods
may not be funded.\n\n\tDrugged driving is a signature issue, one of the
 three top issues, of President Obama&amp;rsquo;s 2010 Drug Control
Strategy. Recently released NHTSA data from the 2007 National Roadside
Survey of 7,500 daytime and nighttime drivers, including survey
questions and oral fluid and blood samples, showed that 11% of samples
had detectable levels of illegal drugs and 5% had medications. Several
studies in the United States and European countries found that at least
35% of people stopped for erratic driving, drivers involved in a crash,
and fatally injured drivers had at least one drug in their system, and
many were under the influence of both drugs and alcohol. Marijuana is
the most prevalent drug, after alcohol, found in samples from drivers
involved in traffic accidents or stopped for impaired driving. Those and
 other released data have alerted the research community of the
problem&amp;rsquo;s magnitude and the urgency of addressing
it.\n\n\tMajor effort to address the drugged driving problem will have a
 significant effect on the demand for drugs and on drug use in the
United States. However, this effort is being impeded by multiple
factors: 1) lack of available or quality data to adequately understand
the magnitude of the problem and its possible solutions; 2a) lack of
prevention strategies specifically tailored to drugged driving; 2b) lack
 of understanding of ways to tailor existing effective strategies to
address drugged driving; 3) lack of treatment interventions to address
the problem, other than from a criminal justice perspective: 4) lack of
effective policy approaches to address the patterns of drugged driving
problems.\n\n\tThis SBIR Contract solicitation seeks to address a need
for more and better quality data on drugged driving and, therefore,
seeks proposals to develop web-based systems that can allow for
efficient access to and utilization of data on drugged driving, and
allow public and private organizations and officials to locate, plan,
implement and evaluate the effectiveness of prevention and intervention
strategies to address the problem of drugged driving and its associated
consequences. Responses to this solicitation can consider ways to adapt
existing systems that compile, organize and assess quality data and
implementation approaches. They may also design completely new web
systems to accomplish these goals.\n\n\tThe web systems proposed in
response to this solicitation should provide a repository of necessary
information and resources for researchers and policy-makers to utilize.
Some of the core research questions to address through this scientific
initiative include the following areas.\n\n\tData and

        "topic_name": "The Development of Lateral Flow
Immunochromatographic Devices to Detect Antibodies ",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tDuring the past decade,
several companies have developed lateral flow immunochromatographic
devices to detect antibodies to individual communicable diseases. More
recently, these platforms have also been adapted to detect specific
antigens associated with these infections. These inexpensive
point-of-care (POC) tests offer considerable advantages over
conventional laboratory tests, since they can be performed in remote,
peripheral settings with little or no instrumentation by primary health
care workers. In addition, counseling and treatment, if appropriate, can
 be given at the initial consultation. They have been used successfully
to screen pregnant women for HIV and syphilis to prevent vertical
transmission of these infections and therefore prevent congenital
disease. In addition, in areas remote from formal, organized blood
banks, these and other POC tests have been used to screen potential
blood donors to prevent transfusion related infections. Unfortunately
these tests are usually performed as individual tests for antibodies or
antigens for single infections, which results in a series of test strips
 being run in parallel. Each may have different flow characteristics,
buffers and run times which can lead to confusion and potential
inaccuracies.\n\n\tProject Goal: &amp;nbsp;The goal of this project is
to develop a highly sensitive, highly specific, rapid and easy to use,
disposable multiplex immunochromatographic screening device to detect
Hepatitis BsAg and malarial antigen together with antibody to Human
Immunodeficiency Virus 1 and 2 (HIV 1\/2) and syphilis in a single
finger-stick sample of whole blood in order to screen pregnant women to
prevent vertical transmission of infection. In addition, a single device
 to detect Hepatitis BsAg and malarial antigen together with antibody to
 Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 and 2 (HIV
1\/2) and syphilis in a single finger-stick sample in order to screen
blood donors for transfusion- related infections in settings where
conventional laboratory facilities are not available.\n\n\tVendors
should have access to existing individual immununochromatographic tests
to detect antibody to HIV, HCV and syphilis and tests to detect HBsAg
and malaria. Likewise, vendors should be prepared to optimize their
assays to detect both antibodies and specific antigens in the same
cassette device on a single specimen. The contractor will be able to
leverage this research and development opportunity to build capacity
within the company to develop further multiplex platforms with antigen\/
 antibody combinations of diagnostic value. The CDC is willing to
collaborate with small business by furnishing appropriate specimens to
enable optimization of the multiplex platform and to facilitate both
laboratory evaluations to be conducted within CDC laboratories in
Atlanta and clinical evaluations in appropriate field sites in settings
where these infections constitute a significant public health problem
and where the tests would ultimately be used routinely.\n\n\tImpact:
&amp;nbsp;It is anticipated that the development of these two multiplex
immunochromatographic test cassettes could result in a significant
reduction in rates of congenital HIV and syphilis together with other
infections that can be transmitted from mother to child. In addition,
make blood transfusions safer in areas where laboratory testing is
either not available, or of poor quality.\n",

Prevent Transfusion Transmitted Babesiosis",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tBabesiosis is a potentially
life-threatening zoonotic disease caused by intraerythrocytic protozoan
parasites, which usually are tick-borne but are also transmissible by
transfusion. Most infections are asymptomatic or only causemild disease
but severe disease can occur in neonates, the elderly and
immunocompromised patients. Babesiosis became nationally notifiable in
January, 2011.\n\n\tBlood transfusion transmission of babesiosis, a
healthcare acquired infection, has been recognized as an important
source of infection and disease and is currently the most frequently
reported transfusion acquired disease in the United States. Asymptomatic
 individuals are difficult to recognize and, therefore, transfusion of
blood and blood components collected from them may result in
transfusion-transmitted babesiosis (TTB), leading to potentially fatal
clinical illness. Babesiosis is associated with significant morbidity
and mortality. Increasing numbers of cases of TTB and TTB-associated
deaths have been reported in recent years. In July, 2010 the Blood
Products AdvisoryCommittee of FDA strongly supported implementation of
regional blood donor screening for Babesia microti infection. Currently,
 no blood donors screening test for babesiosis has been licensed and
available diagnostic test formats are not suitable for the high
throughput testing required for blood donor screening.\n\n\tProject
Goal: &amp;nbsp;The goal of this project is the development, validation,
 and FDA clearance of a high-throughput method for Babesia- specific
antibodies with sensitivity and specificity equal to or greater than the
 existing gold standard method, the indirect immunofluorescence antibody
 assay, which is labor intensive and not suitable for high throughput
blood donor screening. An effective and feasible test must be compatible
 with existing blood donor screening platforms, which require rapid
results and flexibility to accommodate large numbers of samples tested
simultaneously. Other innovative non serological approaches that can be
easily integrated into existing blood donor screening platforms and
workflows would also be considered. All submissions must include
validation and FDA clearance as deliverables.\n\n\tImpact:&amp;nbsp;
Reliable blood donor screening for babesiosis will prevent transmission
by transfusion and decrease the number of deaths attributable to this
healthcare acquired disease. This would preserve the blood supply since
other options for controlof this transfusion transmissible disease
include stopping blood collections in risk areas for months when
tick-borne transmission is occurring. Introduction of blood donor
screening for babesiosis will help improve blood safety and prevent
healthcare acquired disease, in keeping with CDC&amp;rsquo;s goals. CDC
will collaborate with test developers to validate tools in the field and
 to disseminate new technologies.\n",

Folate Insufficiency in the Field",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tMany neural tube defects
(NTD), serious birth defects of the brain and spine, can be prevented if
 a woman consumes folic acid daily before and during early pregnancy.
Although mandatory folic acid fortification has increased blood folate
concentrationsin the U.S., folate insufficiency remains a severe problem
 on a global scale. Determining the burden of folate insufficiency in a
population can help set the stage for large-scale interventions such as
food fortification. However, lack of data on blood folate levels hampers
 public health efforts to identify, intervene, and evaluate populations
at risk for NTDs. In addition, many countries have remote and isolated
populations, making population-based testing of blood folate levels
challenging due to limited access to appropriate laboratories. Dried
blood spots (DBS) might be adapted to assess folate status in the field,
 but use of this technique for collecting, storing, and analyzing folate
 levels quickly and effectively has not been established.\n\n\tProject
Goal: &amp;nbsp;The goal of this project is to develop technology to
measure blood folate levels, and specifically to develop: 1) an assay
that can be used &amp;lsquo;on the spot&amp;rsquo; in fieldwork either
using DBS or whole blood, or 2) an assay in which the sample is
collected in the field and analysis is done in a laboratory within 48
hours.Additional specifications are that 1) the instrument needs to be
portable and low maintenance, so it can be used directlyin the field; 2)
 the maximum volume needed should not exceed 50 uL of blood from a
finger stick; 3) the imprecision of the assay should not exceed 10-15%
at the clinical decision point of 140 ng\/mL of red blood cell folate;
and, 4) the assay results have to be comparable to traditionally
accepted assays, such as the microbiological
assay.\n\n\tImpact:&amp;nbsp; The global burden of folate insufficiency
as it relates to NTDs has not yet been determined, but is estimated to
be over 200,000 pregnancies yearly. This gap in data is primarily
because large-scale national surveillancestudies of folate levels and
NTDs have not been possible in many countries. Additionally, many
countries have remote areas where access to appropriate laboratory
facilities is limited or available laboratories have limited capacity
for biological testing. An assay that can add data on folate status from
 remote areas to a country&amp;rsquo;s surveillance system can allow for
 an accurate burden of disease estimate. Developmentof these new assays
would provide the means to document the folate status of target
populations and help determine a course of action to address folate
insufficiency programmatically. The expectation is that the proposed
technology will meet market demand by laboratories and in-the-field
research groups.\n",

Reporting System (VAERS) serves as the nation&amp;rsquo;s frontline
early warning system to detect vaccine safety concerns. To enhance and
sustain reporting efficiency and improve data quality during routine and
 emergency situations, recent efforts have been made to advance the
VAERS web reporting interface and increase web-based reporting. Although
 web-based reporting can be done with handheld devices and smartphones
it is cumbersome and time consuming. The project goal therefore is the
development of application software (app) that will help providers
readily complete a VAERS reporting form from a smartphone or other
device that will be uploaded instantly to the VAERS
system.\n\n\tCurrently, more than 200 million mobile apps are used by
doctors and patients, and more than 600 million medical apps are
projected to be used by 2012. A free app for the FDA&amp;rsquo;s adverse
 drug reaction reporting system, &amp;ldquo;MedWatch&amp;rdquo;, has
already developed and marketed to health care providers and the public
to facilitate reporting to MedWatch. With the rapid development of apps
and increasing use and popularity of smartphones by health care
professionals, an app to facilitate reporting to VAERS would likely be
well accepted. This innovation relates to two CDC strategic public
health priorities: 1) better prevent illness, injury, disability and
death by enhancing the overall vaccine safety monitoring system and
thereby keep vaccines as safe as possible and 2) strengthen
surveillance, epidemiology, and laboratory services. Moreover, it also
addresses the 2011 National Vaccine Plan goal to &amp;ldquo;enhance the
vaccine safety system.&amp;rdquo;\n\n\tProject Goal: &amp;nbsp;The goal
of this project is the development of a smartphone application (e.g.,
iPhone, iPad, Android) that will allow a healthcare provider to
instantly link to a VAERS reporting form that is user-friendly and is
submitted to the VAERS central database rapidly and securely. This
project is a proof of concept study that an app for smartphones can
enhance reporting by providers. The VAERS app can include the reportable
 event table, links to other Web sites and general information about
vaccine safety. The results of this project have the potential to
increase reporting for clinically important vaccine adverse events since
 it will target clinicians.\n\n\tFurther dissemination would require
additional development to make the app compatible with other smartphones
 or devices. Collaboration with marketing venues will be necessary to
make this app widely available (e.g., iTunes). Adding a link to download
 this app to multiple provider Web sites such as the American Academy of
 Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians and others would be
appropriate to widely disseminate and encourage adoption of this
innovative technology.\n\n\tImpact: &amp;nbsp;This work will improve
data quality, timeliness of data acquisition and data processing and
augment (i.e., increase reporting from clinicians) the vaccine safety
monitoring system that contributes to the assessment of risk from
vaccinations and helps the Advisory Committee on Vaccine Practices
(ACIP) and CDC make evidence-based recommendations for the use of
vaccines. Enhanced reporting to VAERS will make this surveillance system
 a more robust and responsive public health tool for monitoring
potential adverse event signals and lead to enhanced vaccine safety
monitoring capacity.\n",

Diagnosis of Fungal Infections ",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tFungi are some of the most
common causes of major HIV-related opportunistic infections in the
world. Cryptococcal meningitis is estimated to kill more HIV-infected
persons than tuberculosis in sub-Saharan Africa. Pneumocystis pneumonia
is the most common cause of acute pneumonia in most areas;
histoplasmosis is extremely common in Central and South America, and
penicilliosis marneffei is highly endemic in Southeast Asia. Prevention
of serious sequelae (meningitis, respiratory failure, bloodstream
infection) and death in these patients depends on prompt diagnosis and
treatment. However, in many resource-poor areas, diagnosis of these
infections is not possible because diagnostic tests are not
available.\n\n\tProject Goal: &amp;nbsp;The goal of this project is the
development of rapid, simple, affordable laboratory tests that are
designed to be used in resource-poor settings to diagnose these
diseases, and to distinguish them from other non-fungal diseases with
similar symptoms. Such tests are feasible: a lateral flow
&amp;ldquo;dipstick&amp;rdquo; test for Cryptococcus is in development
and shows promise.\n\n\tRapid fungal diagnostics is an area that should
be of particular interest to small business concerns. Laboratories in
developing countries have either no alternative methods, or only
elaborate and inefficient methods, to diagnose fungal infections at this
 time. The developed assays should have the characteristics of
simplicity and robustness as described by the World Health Organization.
 Innovative approaches such as &amp;ldquo;dipstick&amp;rdquo; technology
 that can be used in the clinic and the field are already being employed
 in areas such as malaria diagnostics, showing proof-of-concept. Such
rapid fungal diagnostics can be incorporated into resource-poor
countries as laboratory capacity-building efforts develop and
continue.\n\n\tImpact:&amp;nbsp; Rapid point-of-care tests can reduce
deaths, hospitalization, and other serious sequelae (including immune
reconstitution syndrome) among HIV-infected persons by differentiating
these diseases from other clinically similar ones, thereby allowing for
appropriate therapy. The primary benefit of such diagnostics is in
resource-poor countries where HIV incidence is high, but market
opportunities also exist in the United States where these fungal
infections also occur in high-risk patient populations.\n",

 in Nonhuman Primate Models",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe field of HIV prevention
has recently gained two new biomedical preventions: 1) a partially
effective HIV vaccine, RV-144 delivered parenterally, and 2) partially
effective pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the form of a microbicide
delivered as a vaginal gel, or as a daily, oral tablet. These
preventions, while not yet approved for general use, are - either in the
 same form or in modified form - imminently scalable and likely to be
implemented widely in upcoming years. CDC has been involved in
evaluating and developing biomedical preventions such as these for many
years, both in animal models and in humans. Historically, CDC has also
provided guidance on implementation of vaccines, and through ACIP, will
do so for HIV vaccines as they emerge.\n\n\tIt is likely that future HIV
 vaccine trials in humans will have to incorporate control arms with
PrEP, be it by oral, vaginal or rectal delivery. The partial efficacy
observed with a single intervention, whether it be a vaccine or PrEP,
has escalated the need to assess if these two combined preventions will
have additive, synergistic or possibly even negative\/inhibitory
effects. CDC researchers have used statistical models to explore these
questions. However, animal models allow direct testing of the combined
efficacy of partially effective prevention methods. CDC and the field of
 HIV prevention would gain immensely from such preclinical results. This
 could directly inform clinical trial designs, and also inform
implementation of novel preventions.\n\n\tProject Goal:&amp;nbsp; The
goal of this project is to model, in non-human primates, combination
preventions such as PrEP and candidate HIV vaccines, to determine if
these combinations have neutral, additive, synergistic, inhibitory or
other effects.\n\n\tVendors should have prior experience testing animal
models of HIV, anti-retrovirals or microbicides for HIV prevention and
HIV vaccines. Proposals should include studies of at least 2 preventions
 for HIV infection (such as PrEP and a candidate HIV vaccine) that are
representative of products in the current pipeline for human use.
Furthermore, proposals should include a timeline, and should incorporate
 statistical estimates or sample sizes for different study arms that
will allow appropriately powered evaluation of additive, synergistic or
other interactions. Proposals may be structured to test study arms
sequentially. Experimental design should include ways to measure
correlates of protection and mechanisms of interaction. Studies should
be designed with the long-term goal of providing information that will
guide either human clinical trials of combination prevention,
implementation of combination preventions or both.&amp;nbsp;\n",

        "topic_name": "Data Mining Software for Large-Scale Analyses of
Infections Caused by Hepatitis Viruses",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe incidence of hepatitis A
 (HAV) is falling rapidly, but outbreaks of food-borne HAV outbreaks
occur occasionally, and can involve large numbers of people. An
estimated 50,000 Americans acquire new hepatitis B (HBV) infection
annually. The health burden of persistent or chronic HBV infection is
also heavy, with high mortalities due to cirrhosis or cancer. Adding to
the burden of 1.2 million people in the USA estimated to be chronically
infected with HBV is an estimated 40,000 foreign-born, chronically
infected persons per year resulting from immigration. Chronic HBV causes
 liver cancer, and this cancer is a leading cause of death for certain
population groups in the USA such as Asian-Americans. Hepatitis C (HCV)
is the most common chronic blood borne infection in the United States,
affecting 3.2 million of Americans. Since 2000, an estimated 85,000 new
HCV infections occur every year and approximately 19,000 new infections
occurred in 2006. However, 50% of HCV infected persons are unaware of
their infection. Additionally, several studies have estimated that 30%
of HIV-infected individuals are also infected by HCV and 60-90% of
individuals infected with HIV by intra-venous drug use (IVDU) have HCV.
The total estimate for co-infected individuals in the USA is 300,000.
About a fifth of the American population is estimated to be exposed to
hepatitis E (HEV), but the health impact of this exposure is
unknown.\n\n\tHepatitis viruses are a diverse group of viruses with
different major modes of transmission. Hepatitis A and hepatitis E
viruses (HAV and HEV) may cause food-borne outbreaks. Hepatitis B and
hepatitis C viruses (HBV and HCV) are blood-borne viruses. Although,
infection with any of the hepatitis viruses has a similar clinical
presentation, the degree of sequence heterogeneity of these viruses
varies. Recent advances in laboratory technologies and computational
biology have facilitated a comprehensive sequence analysis of the
genomes of hepatitis viruses. This information allows for further
refinement of molecular epidemiological approaches and provides
opportunities to link molecular epidemiological data to demographic,
clinical, laboratory and epidemiological data. In the course of
engagement in clinical and surveillance studies and outbreak
investigations, CDC generates, collects and analyzes such data. Because
of the diversity in the type and sources of these data the
CDC&amp;rsquo;s seeks a software application that will be able to
integrate these disparate datasets and that will permit data mining and
investigator-initiated analysis.\n\n\tProject Goal: &amp;nbsp;The goal
of this project is to develop data mining software that extracts,
transforms, and loads structured data relating to infection with
hepatitis viruses from diverse sources into a warehouse appropriate for
mainframe, client\/server, and PC platforms. This data will include but
may not be limited to demographic, clinical, epidemiological, laboratory
 and phylogenetic information. The software will store and manage the
data in a relational database system with a web-based interface to
provide data access to the scientific community and analysis of
relationships in the stored data using end-user defined queries to
discover disease patterns and trends. The software will have hook
interfaces which allow data to be exported to external programs for
additional analysis, and capture those results into the database. The
software will also export the outcomes of such analyses in publication
ready formats.\n\n\tImpact: &amp;nbsp;It is expected that the software
will generate associations between epidemiological and laboratory data
leading to the discovery of new disease patterns, epidemiological trends
 and proteomic associations. Such discoveries are expected to lead to
new strategies for public health interventions, surveillance,
prophylaxis and the development of antivirals and vaccines. This
software tool will be applicable not only to hepatitis viruses but other
 pathogens in the areas of epidemiology, laboratory research and public
health.\n",

Identify Adolescent-Friendly Health Care Services",
        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tAdolescent births and
sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain serious public health
issues in the U.S. Although the U.S. teen birth rate fell to an all-time
 low in 2009, it remains the highest among all developed countries.
National data indicate that one in four adolescent females (14-19 years)
 has an STI. In 2007, 13% of high school students had been tested for
HIV. Although adolescents have clear reproductive and sexual health care
 needs, it can be difficult to connect adolescents to sexual and
reproductive health care that takes into account their unique needs.
Confidentiality, transportation, hours of operation, and payment can all
 serve as barriers to referral to, and use of, appropriate youth
reproductive and sexual health care. Schools can serve as an important
source of referral to health care providers in the community, and
evidence-based models such as that of Project Connect can help
adolescents to access youth-friendly health care.\n\n\tProject Goal:
&amp;nbsp;The goal of the project is to develop a software package
featuring a location-based application that can be used on a cell phone
or tablet to provide the location of adolescent reproductive and sexual
health care providers local to the user. In addition, the application
should have a web-based portal and SMS functionality (i.e., short
message service, texting). The application would provide the name,
location, and hours of service of the health care provider; contact
information; services provided; fee for service and reimbursement
options; transportation options; and directions. Additionally, health
care providers would be screened for the extent to which their services
are adolescent-friendly. Additional functionality may include the
possibility of anonymous reviews and ratings by adolescents on service
providers. Feasibility studies for this application would be conducted
in Detroit, Michigan, and Los Angeles, California. Detroit is the site
of a current replication of Project Connect, and Los Angeles was the
original study site. Vendors should have expertise in sexual health
among adolescents, school health, and sexual risk reduction strategies.
Further, successful vendors will have expertise in youth usage of social
 media.\n\n\tExtensive collaboration is likely for this project. This
application overlaps with the STD and HIV testing site locator Web site
in that it provides a listing of health care providers and locations and
 may extend the functionality of this Web site. Further collaboration
would be done with Project Connect investigators and youth health care
providers within community, school, district, and health departments in
Detroit and Los Angeles. This research would benefit on-going efforts to
 link youth to care nationally and facilitate use of the Project Connect
 model, as well as to more effectively link youth to care in the
selected cities.\n\n\tImpact: &amp;nbsp;This application would increase
the effective referral to and use of reproductive and sexual health care
 resources for youth in metropolitan areas with high prevalence of HIV,
STI, and pregnancy among adolescents. Broader use of a developed
application would be used by youth, school health care providers, and
community health care providers and would provide services that would
prevent or provide care for HIV and STIs nationally.\n",

 main cause of morbidity and mortality for first responders (police,
fire, ambulance\/EMT, and military), and delays in emergency response.
Intersections are a frequent location for these incidents, with
emergency vehicles approaching at a high rate of speed, often against
traffic signals. Despite the use of sirens and flashing lights, other
vehicles are not always aware that they are on a collision course with
an emergency vehicle. Increasingly, many drivers may be distracted from
the use of personal wireless electronic devices and are unaware of the
sirens or flashing lights of first responders.\n\n\tProject Goal:
&amp;nbsp;The goal of this project is to develop technologies to
interface with personal wireless systems. These technology interfaces
would enable first responders and other emergency vehicles to send out
wireless messages (i.e., alerts to cell phones, GPS devices, etc.),
located in private motor vehicles in the immediate vicinity of the
responder. In addition to a proximity alert, this technology could also
send wireless signals to vehicle based GPS devices showing location and
direction of movement of emergency vehicles in relation to the private
vehicle&amp;rsquo;s GPS device.\n\n\tImpact:&amp;nbsp; Private driver
situational awareness is critical to avoid vehicle crashes and related
injuries associated with emergency vehicles transiting to or from
emergency incident locations. The widespread use of wireless devices by
drivers of motor vehicles will continue to increase as new technologies
are developed in this market sector. Technologies that alert drivers of

        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Ground\/Sea Vehicles,
ElectronicsACQUISITION PROGRAM: PEO Ground Combat SystemsOBJECTIVE: The
objective of this project is to develop new energy storage materials
capable of absorbing and delivering large amounts of energy in short
periods of time. Phase 1 will investigate the feasibility of various
materials, study the ability to absorb energy at very high rates and
also deliver large amounts of power to electrical loads. Furthermore,
the feasibility studies would provide options for developing and
prototyping classes of rechargeable energy storage materials that could
be used in munitions power sources to provide the capability of multiple
 uses in a volumetric efficient format for high power delivery in small
and lightweight packages that would meet all military
requirements.Progress has been made in the search for materials and
devices that have both a very high power density as well as a very high
energy density. Such devices effectively would combine the power density
 of a capacitor and the energy density of a battery to create the
ultimate energy storage medium for portable electronics in general and
gun fired munitions in particular. This technology could allow the
dumping of a large amount of energy in very short time periods and would
 allow the simplification of munition power sources from a combination
of batteries and capacitors to a single device capable of satisfying the
 entire power budget. For munitions applications, such a device could be
 charged completely during the initialization sequence of the round to
provide power throughout the entire munition power budget, which would
typically last for a few seconds. The energy stored would need to be on
the order of 10s of kJs for the intended applications with typical
runtimes maxing out on the order of several minutes. Devices capable of
meeting these requirements as well as the standard munition
environmental requirements would have widespread use among munitions
applications.DESCRIPTION: Power sources for munitions have relatively
strict requirements, and consequently are limited to a narrow selection
of conventional solutions. These conventional solutions are expensive,
large, and will not generally support a significant amount of commercial
 attractiveness. Reserve batteries are typically utilized in order to
meet the 20-year shelf life, but they suffer from reduced power and
energy densities because of the separation of electrolyte from the cell,
 and\/or suffer from a limited run time, or power capability depending
on the application. It would be desirable to have a device, which could
store a large amount of energy over the time period of a few seconds and
 satisfy the complete munition power budget. Combining the multiple
power sources within some munitions maximizes the volumetric efficiency
of the munition power source, allowing for high power delivery in small
and lightweight package that would meet all military requirements.This
has advantages in munitions since it provides significant flexibility in
 power system design. Currently, there may be up to three energy storage
 components in munitions The replacement of these three elements with a
single energy storage component would reduce weight and volume and
provide system flexibility and would require a rechargeable high power
battery with characteristics similar to a high power capacitor but with
an energy storage capability of a battery. Identification and production
 of a suitable high power rechargeable electrochemical power source is
the objective of this program. In addition there are operational and
military operational temperature requirements (\u201340 to +145 degrees
F), a required shelf life of 20 years and a manufacturability for these
power sources. Voltage outputs should extend from a few volts to 2
Kilovolts. There is a lack of suitable solutions to meet the Army
munitions needs for rechargeable high power batteries with
capacitor-like power delivery capabilities.PHASE I: Feasibility
evaluation of proposed high power high energy storage power will include
 identification of electrochemical power source materials and suitable
engineering architectures to deliver high power and acquire energy at
rates similar to high power capacitors. In addition to power delivery
performance, capabilities to operate under military conditions \u2013
e.g. over wide temperature ranges, and to retain their storage
characteristics over a period of 20 years will also be included in the
search for suitable chemistries and engineering. The selection will then
 down select to candidate prototypes for transition to Phase II. The
energy storage component will also offer high safety throughout a range
of environmental and operational conditions.PHASE II: Build full-scale
rechargeable high power and high energy storage prototypes and test in
relevant environments. Demonstrate that prototypes can survive in
operational environments while providing voltages from a few volts to up
 to 2000 volts with the capability of integration into munitions power
systems to.PHASE III: Develop a manufacturing plan for transition from
prototypes to low rate initial production. Possibility for application
not limited to the realm of munitions. Examples include electric vehicle
 transportation, high power tools, medical devices, communications and
entertainment.",

        "topic_name": "Clean Electromagnetic Environment (EME)
Generation",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Sensors, ElectronicsOBJECTIVE:
 The contractor shall develop a methodology to greatly reduce the
occurrence or magnitude of intermodulation products in an RF environment
 generation system.DESCRIPTION: The US Army Electronic Proving Ground
(EPG) is the Army\u2019s Developmental Tester for tactical electronic
warfare (EW) systems. The Army needs these EW systems to be able to
operate effectively in very dense and complex Radio Frequency (RF)
Environments. In our testing we often are tasked to generate a tailored
Electromagnetic Environment (EME) specific to the area of interest for
the System Under Test (SUT) or to play out a specific operational
scenario. Some scenarios are so specific that a set of signals and
protocols, must be transmitted in the correct sequence with the exact
content in order to test an SUT. These special signal sets may be
transmitted with additional environment signals or they may be in a more
 benign environment. Often EPG\u2019s goal is to develop a valid signal
script for the SUT or area of operation and faithfully transmit this
script over the air to immerse the SUT in this desired environment. A
natural consequence of generating many signals within a simulator system
 and then transmitting them through a common amplifier and antenna
system is that intermodulation products are produced. These
intermodulation products are extraneous, unwanted signals with no
universal method to remove them. They take up a percentage of the
amplifier\u2019s power. present extraneous signals to the SUT that were
not called for in the test, or occur in unauthorized frequencies. One
method to partially reduce these unwanted signals is to use higher power
 output amplifiers but that comes with a much higher price along with
increased power draw and cooling requirement.&amp;nbsp; Both of which
limits our ability to field EME generation systems.The goal of this
project is to develop a methodology to analyze the signal scripts as a
time ordered event list and by knowing which signals are present
simultaneously, estimate the intermodulation products that would be
produced. Then provide a methodology to greatly reduce or eliminate each
 of the intermodulation products before it can exit the amplifier. Does
knowing the intermodulation products ahead of time give us an
opportunity to be able to cancel them out within the amplifier before
they are amplified and transmitted? If we did not have a time ordered
event list and the mix of signals transmitted were a freeplay scenario
of random signals is there a way of stopping these intermodulation
products from complicating our transmissions, amplifiers, and
environment?Typical amplifier band breaks for our EME systems would be:1
 \u2013 30 MHz20 \u2013 500 MHz500 \u2013 1000 MHz1000 \u2013 3000
MHzThe successful methodology would allow for quicker EME scenario
generation without requiring extensive test equipment to confirm the
quality of the environment to be presented. On site operators could use
this tool to modify test sequences with less risk involved in producing a
 poor quality script.&amp;nbsp; In addition it is anticipated that
existing test equipment will be use in a larger set of scenarios
minimizing the equipment that needs to be supported and fielded for
testing.Although the testing example described here is a rather
specialized case EME generation is becoming common in many testing and
training applications.&amp;nbsp; EPG also tests tactical radio frequency
 (RF) networks and their performance in dense urban environments is also
 an issue.&amp;nbsp; Many urban training sites have been built in the
last decade and primary component of the environment is the
electromagnetic environment.&amp;nbsp; The training takes in to account
the inability to communicate as hostilities escalate so does the use of
the RF spectrum and good communications deteriorate just as they are
needed most.&amp;nbsp; One of the biggest investments in an urban
setting is the Army\u2019s Brigade Combat Team Modernization (BCTM)
program is setting up EME generation systems for that training
site.&amp;nbsp; Thus numerous opportunities exist in creating EME
systems for government testing and training organizations.&amp;nbsp; In
the commercial sector the manufacturers of automobiles, aircrafts, ships
 etc also expose their vehicles to high powered signals and also to
dense environments to ensure their control systems are shielded well
enough to survive these environments.&amp;nbsp; Again numerous
opportunities exist for this technology to greatly reduce costs in the
makeup of the EME generation systems.&amp;nbsp; A technology that could
reduce or eliminate intermodulation produces would reduce the RF
amplifier costs, operation, maintenance, and cooling costs of the entire
 system.PHASE I: Determine the technical feasibility for a methodology
to eliminate or greatly reduce the magnitude of intermodulation products
 from signals mixing in an active RF device. Provide a clear path to
accomplish this methodology in an automated manner. Show analysis or
modeling that proves the viability of the methodology.PHASE II: Develop
the methodology in its automated form to a prototype or proof of concept
 level for demonstration purposes. By the end of Phase II provide a
demonstration of the desired performance enhancement of the methodology
to the Government and deliver a final report on all plans and
results.PHASE III: The intention for Phase III is to procure a
production ready capability based upon the successful demonstration of
Phase II. The form of this capability is unknown at this time but
expected to be readily adaptable to existing RF amplifiers and current
EPG test operations. There will be many other Government customers for
this technology to increase the fidelity and reduce the cost of their
own EME generation which has become a backdrop to all manner of test
items. This would also benefit military electronic countermeasure
systems, Electronic Attack, (EA) to be more efficient and more precise
in the target frequency bands. The technology would be adaptable to the
next generation EA systems that attempt to surgically target specific
signals rather than utilize a wide band barrage of noise. The surgical
method would transmit several narrow band signals, each to counter a
specific target and this technology would avoid the creation of numerous
 unintended intermods that parasitically drain power from the intended
targets and may unintentionally jam the friendly signals. Commercial
applications for this technology would include broadband amplifier
manufacturers and manufacturers of multichannel communications
systems.",

        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: ElectronicsACQUISITION
PROGRAM: PEO Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and SensorsThe technology
within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms
Regulation (ITAR), which controls the export and import of
defense-related material and services. Offerors must disclose any
proposed use of foreign nationals, their country of origin, and what
tasks each would accomplish in the statement of work in accordance with
section 3.5.b.(7) of the solicitation.OBJECTIVE: To develop a practical
Body Wearable Radio Direction Finding (DF) Antenna, or \u201cDF
Mantenna\u201d, that will provide the soldier with a low profile antenna
 for tactical environments that performs in the 50 MHz to 500 MHz range
with 0dB Gain.DESCRIPTION: The DF Mantenna is required to provide the
desired capabilities without a large visual signature.&amp;nbsp; An
antenna mounted on a mast would provide a noticeable, unique appearance
in combat environment, along with a likelihood of entanglement with
obstructions during Soldier maneuvers. This appearance may bring
attention to the soldiers and reveal their mission to
observers.&amp;nbsp; Antenna size constraints can result in DF accuracy
performance tradeoffs over the frequency bands of interest.&amp;nbsp; In
 order to overcome some of the possible problems with a mast-mounted
antenna, the DF Mantenna could be the solution to resolving these
issues.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: This SBIR Phase 1 proposal will
focus on designing and developing a body-wearable antenna system, such
as a one-size-fits-all vest with adjustable straps, with a desired
weight of less than 2 pounds.&amp;nbsp; The DF Mantenna will operate in
the 50 MHz to 500 MHz range with 0 dB Gain.PHASE II: During Phase II The
 DF Mantenna will be developed further to increase its performance
capabilities and integrate the design into an actual IOTV (improved
outer tactical vest). The DF Mantenna must have the capability to
provide an easy to use, user adjustable functionality, to allow the DF
Mantenna to cover the 50 MHz to 500 MHz range. The projected cost of the
 DF Mantenna should not exceed $50,000.&amp;nbsp; The installation of
the DF Mantenna into the vest shall not impede the protective capability
 of the vest. Three prototypes will be provided for government test and
evaluation at government selected facilities. Design considerations must
 be given to future manufacturability and installation into the vest.
Additional engineering development will further improve the design to
allow the DF Mantenna to be completely integrated into the soldier
combat uniform and function properly in the actual combat
environment.PHASE III: Further engineering design efforts will continue
to develop the antenna system design further to include
manufacturability and additional frequency bands of operation. Emphasis
will be on improvements to SWAP (size weight and power). Consideration
will be given to integrate the DF Mantenna into other soldier vests
and\/or soldier ensembles. The integration of the DF Mantenna concept
into clothing will have potential application in the non-military,
commercial electronics market, as well as with first responders (police
and fire fighters) as well as in the construction industry.",

        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: BiomedicalACQUISITION PROGRAM:
 Office of the Principal Assistant for AcquisitionOBJECTIVE: Develop an
innovative, curative treatment for secondary lymphedema that will
restore the function of the lymphatic vessel system.DESCRIPTION:
Secondary lymphedema is a condition in which blockage or damage to the
lymphatic drainage system leads to the retention and build-up of
lymphatic fluid in the surrounding tissue.&amp;nbsp; The most common
cause of lymphedema in the United States is the surgical removal of part
 of the lymphatic system in cancer patients, most significantly in
breast cancer patients. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy in breast
cancer patients can also damage the function of lymph nodes, leading to
lymphedema. There are approximately 2.4 million breast cancer survivors
in the United States, and each year, about 240,000 women are diagnosed
with breast cancer. A recent prospective study found that 42% of breast
cancer survivors developed secondary lymphedema within 5 years of their
treatment.Other causes of secondary lymphedema include trauma from
burns, surgery, and physical injuries, as well as parasitic infection.
&amp;nbsp;Filariasis, a parasitic insect-transmitted infection that is
prevalent in tropical regions, is the most common cause of secondary
lymphedema internationally. Lymphedema in filariasis infection can
progress to a debilitating condition known as
elephantiasis.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is no cure for lymphedema.
Quality of life for individuals with lymphedema is diminished. Although
lymphedema may be temporary in some cases, chronic lymphedema is an
irreversible, debilitating, and lifelong condition that can cause pain
and discomfort, disfigurement, skin damage, limb impairments, fibrosis,
and recurring risk of infection in the affected tissue. Current
treatment options are limited to palliative treatments, including
compression sleeves, massage, skin care, bandage wrapping, and
exercise.Recent studies have shown that lymphangiogenesis, or the
generation of new lymphatic vessels, can be stimulated by growth
factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and
angiopoietin-2. Studies combining VEGF-C with other biologics, such as
adipose-derived stem cells and autologous lymph nodes, have also
demonstrated enhanced lymphangiogenesis compared to VEGF-C alone. The
delivery systems tested in these preliminary studies, which were done in
 animal models, have included novel gel-based systems. Indeed,
injectable hydrogel-based systems for drug delivery are a
state-of-the-art biomaterials technology, underscoring the potential for
 developing novel therapies to treat secondary
lymphedema.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This
 topic is seeking to develop and test an innovative curative strategy
that will stimulate lymphangiogenesis, resulting in functional lymphatic
 vessels and restoring lymphatic fluid drainage. An example of a
therapeutic strategy would include a combination of molecules or
components delivered via an injectable gel, matrix, or other vector that
 has already demonstrated safety and tolerability in vivo.
Administration of the therapeutic will be localized to the affected
tissue and will be minimally invasive.PHASE I: Phase I work will
conceptualize the strategy, design the therapeutic system, and test its
feasibility. Data obtained in Phase I will provide proof-of-concept that
 the therapeutic strategy can stimulate lymphangiogenesis using
appropriate in vitro cell and tissue culture systems. Assays to test the
 lymphangiogenic properties of the therapeutic may include lymphatic
endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation and
branching. Parameters including optimal concentrations, biological
activity, and toxicity will be defined. Appropriate controls will be
used. During Phase I, the delivery system will be developed for
localized administration in vivo.PHASE II: Based on Phase I results,
Phase II work will demonstrate, optimize and validate the therapeutic
strategy in animal models of secondary lymphedema. The FDA approval
pathway should be outlined and considered at each developmental stage.
Parameters including optimal concentrations, biological activity, and
toxicity will be defined. Effectiveness will be determined through
histological and\/or physiological evidence of lymphangiogenesis and
lymphatic flow. Validation of curative success will include the
regression or resolution of lymphedema symptoms. During Phase II,
clinical experts with insight into relevant patient populations should
be consulted during system optimization.PHASE III: A successful Phase II
 project will result in a minimally invasive therapeutic modality that
restores lymphatic function in secondary lymphedema. During Phase III,
additional experiments will be performed as necessary to prepare for FDA
 review of an IND application. A plan for protection of intellectual
property should be created and executed.&amp;nbsp; A detailed market
analysis will be conducted, an initial clinical application for the
therapeutic will be selected, and a Phase I clinical trial will be
initiated. Military application: The therapeutic will be available to
service women and men who suffer from lymphedema caused by: treatments
for breast or other cancers; burn or other combat- or service-related
traumas; and\/or infection with filariasis as a result of their
deployment in tropical regions. Commercial application: Health
professionals worldwide could utilize this therapeutic to treat cancer,
trauma, and filariasis patients who suffer from secondary lymphedema.",

Hours between 20-28oC with an Asanguinous Fluid",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: BiomedicalACQUISITION PROGRAM:
 Office of the Principal Assistant for AcquisitionOBJECTIVE: To
determine if fluids such as transplantation solutions or tissue culture
medium have potential as resuscitation fluids with the goal of better
preservation of physiological function in the traumatically injured
patient in an austere environment as compared to the currently used
saline or Hextend\u00ae.DESCRIPTION: Hemorrhage, or rapid loss of blood,
 is the single greatest cause of morbidity and mortality during combat
(9) as well in civilian trauma (13). When more than half of the
circulating blood is removed, death quickly ensues if bleeding is not
stopped and blood or blood substitutes are not provided. Even after
return of oxygen-carrying capacity to near normal, the poor oxygenation
and\/or nutrient delivery to tissues result in organ damage to the
injured.&amp;nbsp; Several reports have indicated some benefit by the
addition of single components such as glutamine (21) arginine (4)
glycine (22) or estrogen (3). The benefits of hypothermia as protective
against hemorrhagic shock are well-known (11, 14, 20), and it has been
demonstrated that blood can be replaced in animal models with fluids
designed for low temperature preservation of organs (1, 2, 10,
16).&amp;nbsp; However, carrying out hypothermic resuscitation in an
austere environment without means to rapidly reduce body temperature is
not possible at the present time.Recently, organ transplant medicine has
 sought to improve the methods and techniques of organ
preservation.&amp;nbsp; Some of these improvements may be applicable to
resuscitation medicine.&amp;nbsp; The current approved transplantation
fluids have minimal nutrients and rely on low temperature for their
hypo-metabolic effect. However, demand for organs for use in
transplantation has stimulated new technologies for preserving organs.
Examination of recent literature in the area of transplantion surgery
indicates that experimental transplantation fluids have been developed.
These fluids have shown increases in time-to-transplant, as well as
increases in the storage temperature, therefore, reducing the need for
cold storage (5-8, 12, 15, 18, 19). The described fluids provide both
nutrients and oxygen, which may be the reason for their success. These
results indicate that a fluid more complex than saline solutions, yet
simpler than blood or plasma, and relatively free of protein and
therefore less labile, could legitimately maintain metabolism and tissue
 perfusion These solutions are asanguinous, i.e. are not derived from
blood; therefore any oxygen carrying capacity must be related to its
delivery by constituents not based on hemoglobin.&amp;nbsp; In prior
research, solutions based on oxygen delivery by hemoglobin were shown
not to be efficacious (17); therefore, the solutions of interest should
not use hemoglobin as the oxygen transport mechanism.Desired
Capability:&amp;nbsp; The goal of this SBIR initiative is to determine
if the advancement in the capabilities of transplantation fluids or
other physiologic solutions may lead to their additional use as a
resuscitation fluid to extend survivability of the traumatically injured
 until definitive care can be provided.&amp;nbsp; This is not a
solicitation for the development of a fluid, rather it is meant to be an
 evaluation of fluids designed for organ preservation at ambient
temperature as a possible resuscitation fluid. The commercial potential
for a resuscitation fluid would increase the usefulness ten-fold both
for the military and the general public.&amp;nbsp; The fluid should be
shelf-ready without the need for mixing.&amp;nbsp; The end product
should not require refrigeration during storage, nor should there be the
 requirement for cold infusion, reducing the logistical footprint
necessary to send the product far-forward into extreme
environments.&amp;nbsp; The unit size for the fluid should be of
comparable size with current resuscitation fluids so that no revisions
will be needed to incorporate this into the current supply
chain.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: The selected contractor will report on the
feasibility of their proprietary asanguinous solution being used to
maintain the kidney or heart of a mammal prior to transplantation. Due
to the requirement of a second level Animal Use review there will not be
 time in Phase I (6 months) to get approvals in place to demonstrate the
 feasibility.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, the PI will also need to include data
 from in vitro tissue culture studies demonstrating the viability of
mammalian cells in their fluid.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: If selected for Phase
 II, the deliverable will be the validation of the fluid in a large
animal model (swine) by completely replacing the blood with the fluid
and determining for how long at a temperature between 20-28oC the animal
 can be maintained before death is certain. If the animal remains alive
for three hours, it should be resuscitated with its blood and remain
alive for 48 hours with no evidence of physiological
decrements.&amp;nbsp; If the fluid performs as expected, the US Army
Institute of Surgical Research would like to evaluate the fluid in their
 validated hemorrhage model through a Materials Transfer
Agreement.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III: Since this fluid would be used in
patients, FDA approval would be sought in this phase.&amp;nbsp; It is
anticipated during the approval process that the fluid would be tested
in surgical patients for safety and efficacy as a blood supplement or
replacement.&amp;nbsp; Fluid production would follow close behind the
approval due to the need for a more effective resuscitation
fluid.&amp;nbsp; The resultant fluid would be of great value to the
military, however, civilian populations would also benefit significantly
 from the development of this fluid.&amp;nbsp; The technology would
provide a means to resuscitate and save lives and reduce morbidity by
preventing the progression to more serious complications including
multiple organ failure. The so-called \u201cgolden hour\u201d might be
extended allowing the treatment of the traumatically injured en route
prior definitive care in a combat support hospital or civilian trauma
center.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, there would also be practical
applications to blood loss during both emergency and routine
surgeries.&amp;nbsp; The potential usefulness of the fluid is an
indication of the likely market for the product.",

Culturing of Malaria Parasites",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: BiomedicalACQUISITION PROGRAM:
 Office of the Principal Assistant for Acquisition, USAMRMCOBJECTIVE: To
 provide human reticulocytes capable of being invaded by the malaria
parasite Plasmodium vivax in numbers sufficient to support long term in
vitro culturing of the parasite.DESCRIPTION: Malaria is an infectious
disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium
transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. While five species have been shown
to infect humans, two malaria species cause the majority of disease
burden. Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum), the most virulent of
these, is associated with the majority of severe malaria and mortality.
P. vivax, the second major cause of malaria worldwide and the major
cause of malaria outside Africa, is associated with chronic malaria
characterized by relapse after months to years of asymptomatic dormancy.
 P. vivax differs considerably from P. falciparum in that it invades
only reticulocytes (immature red blood cells) expressing Duffy blood
group surface antigens; produces mature, infective gametocytes prior to
clinical symptoms; and can produce dormant liver-stage hypnozoites
responsible for relapse many months after the initial infection. Robust
in vitro culture methods are critically needed for basic and applied
research to develop new vaccines and drugs for malaria. As an example,
many of the advances in P. falciparum research were enabled by the
continuous propagation methods developed in the 1970\u2019s.The greatest
 impediment in developing in vitro blood culture methods for P. vivax is
 that normal peripheral blood contains only 0.5-1.5% reticulocytes, an
insufficient number for maintaining long term P. vivax cultures in
vitro. The key deliverable for this SBIR will be a method of producing
large numbers (log 12 to log 13) of reticulocytes on a regular basis
(Monthly) suitable for use in long term cultures of P. vivax. Two
characteristics of reticulocytes are critical to P. vivax invasion and
propagation (competent). The Duffy blood group surface antigens must be
expressed and adult hemoglobin levels must be high. Preliminary, proof
of concept studies will require log9 to log10 competent reticulocytes on
 a by-weekly basis. In the assay development phase log10 to log11
reticulocytes monthly will be required. Finally, the active screening
will require methods of providing log12 to log13 and greater competent
reticulocytes on a monthly basis. In addition to the reticulocytes, all
appropriate specialized media will need to be developed.One promising
approach to the production of high numbers of blood cells is to use the
expansion and differentiation of Human Stem Cells (HSC). With the advent
 of innovative stem cell technologies, an abundant new source of
reticulocytes is possible. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) is currently funding projects which support the generation of
large numbers of mature erythrocytes from placenta- and umbilical cord-
derived stem cells. Dr. Douay, University of Paris, has developed HSC
expansion and differentiation media conditions for producing large
numbers of erythrocytes. (Giarratna M, Kobari L, Lapilloni H, Chalmers
D, Kirer L, Cynober T, Marden M, Wajcman H and Douay L. Ex vivo
Generation of Fully Mature Human Red Cells From Hematopoetic Stem Cells.
 Nature Biotechnology. 23: 69 2005.). The key to leveraging these
technologies is to arrest erythrocyte development at the reticulocyte
stage.Although there are no continuous in vitro P. vivax cultivation
systems, several laboratories have reported limited in vitro blood- and
liver- stage cultivation [see reviews, Udomsangpetch et al Parasitology
international 56(1):65-9, 2007 and Trends in Parasitology. 24: 85.
2008]. These studies demonstrate that in vitro culture of P. vivax is
possible. A continual supply of reticulocytes at low cost in great
numbers is the key to the development of useful culture
technologies.Finally, the ability to aggregate large numbers of
reticulocytes might be an enhancement to the efforts to establish a
donor-free blood supply. The differentiation of reticulocytes to mature
erythrocytes is an incompletely understood process. Performing this
differentiation in vitro in high efficiencies is likely to be difficult.
 One way to bypass this would be to transplant reticulocytes and allow
them to differentiate in vivo.PHASE I: This Phase will demonstrate the
feasibility of producing log9 to log10 Duffy positive reticulocytes with
 adult hemoglobin greater than 50% and will identify demonstration
success criteria.PHASE II: Awardee will provide WRAIR with log9 to log10
 viable, Duffy positive human reticulocytes along with any specialized
procedures or media needed to maintain the cells. The % reticulocytes
and % Duffy positive of each shipment will be monitored and reported.
The reticulocyte fraction should be greater than 60% of the whole cell
count. Greater than 50% of the reticulocytes should be Duffy positive.
These cells will be tested by WRAIR to determine their ability to
sustain parasite invasion.PHASE III: The awardee will have the capacity
to provide log12 to log13 Duffy positive reticulocytes with adult
hemoglobin greater than 50% and with the reticulocyte count being 60% of
 the whole cell count or greater on a monthly basis. The cells should be
 capable of supporting P. vivax growth in culture. This technology will
provide military and civilian laboratories the capability of screening
chemical compounds in vitro for efficacy against P. vivax malaria
parasites. Culture capability is the first step used for drug discovery
efforts against P. falciparum and has been a major contributor to the
fielding of all current anti-falciparum treatment and prophylactic
drugs. Efforts to develop anti malarial vaccines are also highly
dependent on culturing capability. This technology would open P. vivax
vaccine development to government and civilian laboratories. Finally the
 technology developed here can also be applied to blood farming\/blood
banking activities. The availability of producing large numbers of
reticulocytes with specific characteristics would be useful for
transfusion purposes in a clinical setting.",

        "topic_name": "Multiplex Immunoassays in the Development of
Vaccines Against Enteric Pathogens",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: BiomedicalACQUISITION PROGRAM:
 Office of the Principal Assistant for AcquisitionOBJECTIVE: Develop an
efficient, cost-effective serum-based multiplex assay platform that will
 identify vaccine candidates, determine immune responses and serve as a
potent diagnostic tool for epidemiological and clinical
studies.DESCRIPTION: Based on their impact on the military and global
health, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) has placed a high
priority on the development of vaccines against enteric pathogens
causing diarrhea. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Shigella,
Campylobacter and norovirus are significant causes of diarrhea and
represent significant targets of military, industry, academic and
non-governmental (PATH Global Health) vaccine programs.&amp;nbsp; These
pathogens cause a high level of morbidity and significantly impact the
military in lost manpower days, reduced effectiveness and increased
treatment costs.&amp;nbsp; The emerging awareness of post-infection
complications further adds to the impact of these infections.&amp;nbsp;
In addition, these same pathogens are associated with hundreds of
thousands of deaths among children under 5 in the developing
world.&amp;nbsp; Specific knowledge regarding the potential risks for
infectious diseases in certain areas is critical to preventing disease
as well as directing vaccine research efforts. Key areas in the
development of successful vaccines are the identification of novel
antigen targets, determination of the immunogenicity of a candidate
vaccine, development of efficient means to determine prior pathogen
exposure, and identification of correlates of protective immunity.At
present, the gold standard immunoassay for detecting prior exposures
(non-stool-based) to infectious disease agents is the enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA).&amp;nbsp; In this relatively laborious
assay, antibodies in serum samples are tested for binding to antigens
specific for a given enteric pathogen.&amp;nbsp; Such assays have
significant limitations with respect to the amount of sample required,
technical man-hours (6-24 hours) to complete the assay, and an inability
 to multiplex in a single well, the latter resulting in increased costs
and reagents. Thus, a more efficient assay is desired.&amp;nbsp;An ideal
 immunoassay would allow for the assaying of sera from exposed
individuals against a panel of pathogen components that would provide
valuable information regarding the response to a pathogen-specific
vaccine, and the risk for a given infectious disease exposure and
associated chronic health outcomes within a population subset.&amp;nbsp;
 In addition, the flexibility of the platform would allow for
customizing the assay for a specific disease agent, which would aid in
vaccine discovery, as well as, for testing of immune responses against
candidate vaccines undergoing clinical trials.&amp;nbsp; Lastly, the
ideal assay system would not be cost-prohibitive and allow for
dissemination to and standardization in multiple research sites.PHASE I:
 This phase will demonstrate the feasibility of the immunoassay platform
 to detect exposure(s) of individuals to ETEC, Shigella, Campylobacter
and norovirus utilizing defined historical serum samples archived by
NMRC and\/or samples from the DoD serum repository. The use of human
samples with a known medical history of the targeted infection will
allow for determination of the sensitivity and accuracy of the assay in
detecting responses induced by natural infection.&amp;nbsp; In addition,
 this Phase will also evaluate the flexibility of the platform to allow
for customizable assays specific to a single pathogen or vaccine that
will be tested using existing animal models.&amp;nbsp; Results will be
compared using current methodologies (e.g. ELISA) to determine the
reproducibility and repeatability of the multiplex assay.PHASE II: In
this Phase, the immunoassay developed in Phase I will be validated using
 human serum samples obtained through an ongoing multisite clinical
research study (TravMil) based at DoD travel medicine clinics
investigating the epidemiology of travel and deployment related
infectious disease threats to U.S Department of Defense (DoD) active
duty members and beneficiaries. The organism-specific relative risk of
traveler\u2019s diarrhea among DoD travelers as determined by pre- and
post-travel serological testing and PCR amplification of
organism-specific genetic material collected by participants during
illness on a stool filter paper card. This phase will further
demonstrate the ability of the assay platform to identify and
differentiate between exposures to enteric pathogens.&amp;nbsp;
Furthermore, this Phase will provide a practical implementation of the
assay for use in the clinic and\/or field.PHASE III: The developed
immunoassay would be a significant aid to global health initiatives
focused on preventing enteric diseases due to these pathogens.&amp;nbsp;
 Military, industry, academic and public health institutions would
benefit greatly from the described assay in aspects of vaccine research
and epidemiological measures.&amp;nbsp; The end-state of this technology
 would allow for the rapid identification of immune responses to various
 components of an infectious agent, which would be invaluable in
discovering new vaccine candidates and defining exposures to enteric
infections of interest.&amp;nbsp; In addition, this assay will allow for
 using reduced amounts of valuable samples (e.g. clinical specimens)
while also significantly increasing throughput while simultaneously
reducing work time.&amp;nbsp; Spin-off technologies would include
customizing the assay to detect additional infectious agents that have
relevance not only to human health, but also veterinary health and\/or
the food industry.&amp;nbsp;",

System",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Ground\/Sea Vehicles,
Materials\/Processes, ElectronicsOBJECTIVE:&amp;nbsp; To develop a solar
 lighting system that allows the use of daylight as an interior lighting
 solution for expeditionary shelters while continuing to satisfy
military requirements and mitigating negative solar effects (solar heat
gain, UV damage).DESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; Lighting in deployable shelters
is required 24 hours a day and, typically, more power is used on
lighting during the daytime hours.&amp;nbsp; Utilizing sunlight as
interior lighting for the daytime hours will enable energy savings and
significantly reduce reliance on power management systems.&amp;nbsp;
Unfortunately, the downsides to simple solutions like windows and
skylights include solar heat gain, loss of insulation properties, and
material fogging\/discoloration.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Current powered
lighting systems generate an amount of heat in addition to their power
requirements.&amp;nbsp; The heat generated by current lighting systems,
or windows, adds an additional thermal burden to the Environmental
Control Unit (ECU).&amp;nbsp; Lighting loads increase the amount of fuel
 needed by the shelter for both powering the lighting system and
compensating for the heat generated by the lighting system.&amp;nbsp; A
daylighting solution could provide working, living, or emergency
lighting during the daylight hours without the need for electricity or
generation of excess heat to burden the ECU.Hybrid Solar Lighting (HSL),
 which utilizes the fiber optic transmission of concentrated solar
light, could eliminate the need for powered lights in shelters through a
 majority of the daylight hours.&amp;nbsp; Research performed at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory shows great promise for hybrid solar lighting
applications [3, 4, 5].&amp;nbsp; The technology is currently used in
some large commercial and industrial buildings [6, 7].&amp;nbsp; HSL
systems are able to monitor the light in the shelter and attenuate the
powered lighting according to the amount of fiber optic solar light
available, if needed.&amp;nbsp; The basic concept behind fiber optic
transmission is to concentrate sunlight to a bundle of polymer or glass
fiber optics.&amp;nbsp; Fiber optic transmission filters out UV and IR
from the sunlight.&amp;nbsp; Blocking UV makes fiber optics safe to the
warfighter and any UV sensitive fabrics or devices.&amp;nbsp; Filtering
IR allows the luminaires to be cool to the touch and produce no excess
heat.Acceptable daylighting solutions are not limited to HSL techniques;
 this is only used as an example that would be of interest because of
its no-heat-gain, blackout compliant nature.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Producing a compact, lightweight, and sufficiently ruggedized solar
lighting system is the key to an effective solution for this
solicitation.The currently implemented MIL-PRF-44259D compliant
florescent lights are rated at 300 W per system.&amp;nbsp; If all the
light needed during daylight hours is provided by solar lighting than
the energy saved is 2.1 kWh\/day, or 767 kWh\/yr (2,617,234
BTU\/yr).&amp;nbsp; That is about 83 gallons\/yr of JP-8 per shelter, or
 more than 4600 gallons\/yr for a 600 man base camp.&amp;nbsp; These
estimates do not include fuel savings via the ECU due to no additional
heat load.PHASE I:&amp;nbsp; Develop a robust concept for a solar
lighting or a hybrid solar lighting system for use in expeditionary
shelters.&amp;nbsp; This concept must demonstrate the feasibility of a
solar\/hybrid lighting system in a military soft-walled shelter
(although the technology could be applied to rigid-walled shelters as
well).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The concept must contain a solar
concentrating mechanism, a transmission method (fiber optics, reflective
 material, etc.), and diffuser element to redistribute the
light.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lux measurements must comply with
MIL-STD-1472F for the \u201cOffice work, general\u201d requirement of
755 lux (recommended)\/540 lux (minimum).&amp;nbsp; The solution will be
 compared to existing military light system performance found in
MIL-PRF-44259D.&amp;nbsp; A life cycle cost analysis report will be an
expected deliverable along with the detailed concept
system.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Total packed volume, weight, and cost are
all important factors as with any soft walled shelter component and
should be weighted heavily during conceptual design.PHASE II:&amp;nbsp;
Deliverables expected for Phase II will include a full-scale
solar\/hybrid lighting prototype system and a lighting
level\/effectiveness demonstration implemented in a 32 foot TEMPER
Air-supported shelter [11].&amp;nbsp; The full-scale prototype should
leverage off of the previous detailed concept developed through Phase
I.&amp;nbsp; Investigation of large scale production costs will be
reported, this should include additional system improvement
recommendations before production would begin.By the conclusion of Phase
 II, an acceptable solar lighting system prototype must have the ability
 to be set up and provide light to a 32 x 20 foot shelter in less than
20 minutes by 4 warfighters with limited\/no special tools.&amp;nbsp; As
 required by current lighting solutions, the system must be able to
function in a variety of applicable environmental conditions discussed
in MIL-PRF-44259D.&amp;nbsp; All blackout requirements must be met by
the solution (if applicable).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; To be viable as a
transition worthy system, the prototype performance must not degrade
after 25 strike\/erect cycles.By the end of a Phase II contract, the
target cost per system to effectively illuminate a 32 x 20 foot shelter
should be $8,000.PHASE III:&amp;nbsp; Solar lighting has the possibility
 to be greatly utilized in both the consumer, commercial, and industrial
 applications.&amp;nbsp; As mentioned, most lighting is used during the
day at home, at work, in production facilities, and in retail.&amp;nbsp;
 Utilizing the daylight as the main source of light will provide
significant annual savings in any application, all while limiting solar
heat gain and retaining insulation.",

Bacteriocins\/Anti-Microbials",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Biomedical, Human
SystemsACQUISITION PROGRAM: Combat Feeding Research and Engineering
ProgramOBJECTIVE: To minimize the threat of bioterrorism and the
proliferation of foodborne illness that will adversely affect the
performance of the Warfighter by the development of a controlled release
 mechanism of bacteriocins\/anti-microbials to effectively inhibit a
broad range of spoilage bacteria, pathogens and spores over the extended
 shelf life of ration components.DESCRIPTION: Along with the Warfighter
need for a wider variety of higher quality IM ration components there is
 the ever threatening possibility of bioterrorism and the proliferation
of foodborne pathogens (E.coli 0157H: 7, Salmonella spp, and Listeria
monocytogenes). This was evident in the US Military \u201cDo Not Consume
 Recall\u201d (July 2009) of the dairy shake due to the unintended
presence of Salmonella. This recall had a far-reaching impact on
military subsistence, since the dairy shake is a regular component of
Meals Ready-to-Eat, Unitized Group Rations, and Tailored Operational
Training Meals that dated back to menus of 2002 and could have resulted
in a deadly lesson learned. Bacteriocins\/Anti-Microbials added to IM
rations in the form of mixed time-release preparations will serve as a
biopreservative with the ability to inhibit a wide range of
microbes.Ready to eat products are the mainstay of the military ration
platform because Warfighters need high quality components that require
little preparation, no refrigeration, and are easily consumable while on
 the move. Intermediate Moisture (IM) ration components (i.e.
Shelf-Stable Sandwiches) are the centerpiece of the First Strike
Ration\u00ae, however, a wider variety of components are required to
keep up with Warfighter demand for variety and prevent menu monotony.
Current IM components become noticeably dry or acidic during extended
storage. Existing microbial hurdle guidelines restrict a product\u2019s
pH and water activity (aw) to ensure the safety of IM foods. However,
these restrictions do not take into account the impact on a
product\u2019s organoleptic attributes (i.e., flavor, texture, color,
etc) over time. To improve organoleptic attributes, pH and aw will have
to be elevated, which in turn makes the IM product susceptible to
spoilage and foodborne illness. Current IM components have a pH less
than 5.2 with aw below 0.88. The goal of this SBIR is to achieve optimum
 organoleptics (pH &amp;gt; 5.0, aw &amp;gt; 0.90) by developing a
time-released complex of bacteriocins\/anti-microbials to give the
ration developer greater flexibility with IM product formulations. This
will lead to greater ration acceptance, consumption and increased
component variety. Further, the innovative development of
Controlled-Release Bacteriocins\/Anti-microbials will provide a major
technological advancement that will assure the safety of IM ration
components. All Bacteriocins\/Anti-microbials investigated in this study
 must have a status of Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the
FDA.The innovative challenge in this SBIR lies in the intricacy of
multicomponent food systems, the physical\/chemical properties of food
materials, and the intermolecular interactions of these
bacteriocins\/anti-microbials components (i.e., nisin) in intermediate
moisture foods. Nano-encapsulation may be an ideal mode of delivery for a
 complex of bacteriocins; a key ingredient in the first generation of
novel biopreserved foods. Nano-technology is one means of providing a
controlled release of bacteriocins\/anti-microbials, which is vital in
keeping levels of the bioactive compounds at an effective concentration
over the ration\u2019s three year shelf life. This would eliminate the
less effective and costly method of over loading the ration with the
bioactive up front to account for its likely decrease in effectiveness
over the course of the three year shelf life. Conversely, a bacteriocin
or complex of bacteriocins or other anti-microbial compounds released in
 a controlled manner throughout the ration\u2019s shelf life will
maintain hurdles needed to sustain pathogen inhibition as well as
enhance overall acceptability. The utilization of
bacteriocins\/anti-microbials in hurdle technology may reduce the need
of chemical preservatives while also providing a safe high-quality IM
ration component resistant to spoilage, pathogens and endospores for its
 required shelf life under extreme environmental conditions.Nanoparticle
 concern has been addressed in many studies where they have been shown
to have very limited GI absorption, thus demonstrating low systemic
exposure following oral conception (Kreyling et al., 2002).&amp;nbsp;
However, the fact remains that by changing nanoparticle properties, such
 as surface characteristics, the biocompatibility of the particle can be
 dramatically altered (Stern and McNeil, 2008).&amp;nbsp; According to
Gilor et al., 2008, the human GI tract is a balance complex system
between the individual and the intestinal microflora that is dominated
by two main genera of lactic acid bacteria of which most have means of
producing bacteriocins.&amp;nbsp; These same species of lactic acid
bacteria are used in the production of most bacteriocins and
antimicrobials that are being looked at as future antibiotics and
probiotics.&amp;nbsp; Nisin (GRAS) the most commercially used
bacteriocin is produced in this manner and studies have shown that it
does not possess any sub-chronic or chronic toxicity,
reproductive\/devolomental toxicity, genotoxicity, or carcinogenicity
(Reddy et al., 2004; Hagiwara et al., 2010).&amp;nbsp; This supports
earlier findings of Bernbom et al., 2006 where it was reported that the
intestinal microbiota in human flora-associated rats was not affected
after dosages of nisin in that ingested nisin is easily inactivated by
trypsin and pancreatin of which should remain true on the nano
scale.PHASE I: Combat Feeding Directorate is currently exploring new
biopreservatives alone and in combination to support this goal, but
identifies the need of a controlled release mechanism to maintain the
needed activity level throughout shelf-life requirement. Thus, in
support of this project, innovative research is needed to explore,
develop and design a controlled release mechanism for a complex of
bacteriocins. This complex should work in synergy over time to
effectively control and kill both gram negative and positive foodborne
pathogens, with a release mechanism such as but not limited to nano or
micro encapsulation. Thus, phase I should identify potential
bacteriocins\/anti-microbials, their potential complex mixture, and
encapsulation technique for controlled release of the bacteriocins. The
control mechanism must release the bacteriocins in a manner that ensures
 a minimum two year shelf life for military IM ration components. This
effort should provide technical specifications for a broad range of
nano-encapsulated bacteriocins that are time released but effective
against all foodborne pathogens and can be later identified as a
commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) product to be used to develop the first
generation of novel biopreserved foods for military feeding.Identify
optimal bacteriocin form to incorporare in an intermediate or low
moisture food system. Current forms available include liquid, powder,
solid (pellet) or volatile. Potential carriers should be identified to
determine bacteriocin delivery in system e.g. sachet, packaging,
ingredient. At this time favorable release mechanism (pH, moisture
temperature or light) should also be identified. Deliverables will be a
final report addressing feasibility and practicality of the proposed
concept; technical hurdles that must be achieved as they relate to form,
 carrier, or release mechanism; associated risks and factors limiting
development of a functional prototype of the First Generation of
Controlled Released Bacteriocins. Minor exploratory testing may be used
to confirm efficacy.PHASE II: Develop, test and demonstrate a functional
 prototype of the First Generation of Controlled Released
Bacteriocins\/Anti-microbials (FGCRB\/A) as identified in Phase I.
Initially this can be verified by cocktail inoculation studies in broth
and media systems. Conduct preliminary test, including accelerated
storage studies using model systems or computer simulation, to assess
the design and performance of the time release matrix of bacteriocins.
Identify potential intermediate moisture ration components that will
benefit from this bioactive system and determine optimal way of
integrating this additive (micro pellet, powder, liquid) into select
matrix or food system. Demonstrate and validate concept by using in an
existing ration component, such as a beef\/pork wrap, with elevated pH
and aw. Demonstrate the efficiency of the FGCRB\/A over a range of aw
(ie. 0.88, 0.90, 0.95) and pH (ie. 5.0, 5.5, 6.0). Demonstrate the
FGCRB\/A ability to inhibit pathogen growth (inoculated pack study)
under storage conditions of 80F, 100F and 120F. Efficacy should be shown
 at microbial populations of 102, 104 and 106 colony forming units\/ml
or gram. Maturity of this food additive technology will ensure the
ability to biopreserve a safe, high quality ration component through
life cycle and environmental testing to confirm the conceptual design
from Phase I. The potential for adverse events will also be documented.
This effort will support the development of future ration components.
Deliver a report documenting the research effort along with a detailed
description of the proposed technique\/system and protocol to include
specifications and performance of key components.PHASE III: Produce and
deliver prototypes to support technical and user testing in the field
with military personnel. Make modifications to most successful prototype
 based on organoleptic testing and feedback. A small-scale production
capability will be established to demonstrate the manufacturing
feasibility of the proposed FGCRB\/A. Deliver a report documenting the
theory, design component specifications, performance characterization
and scale-up projection for establishing a large-scale production
capability, to include all relevant microbiological data ensuring
wholesomeness, safety and adverse event issue if any. The concept
meeting the requirement outlined in this effort would be applicable to
military feeding, the commercial food industry, space feeding and
emergency relief (camping, trucking, disaster relief). A
commercialization strategy shall be outlined and a commercialization
partner, if required, shall be defined to demonstrate a well-defined

canopies.DESCRIPTION: The intent of this solicitation is to develop a
lightweight, high strength fabric or membrane which could be used as a
replacement for current parachute fabrics at cost metrics which reduce
(desired) or match the cost of current parachute fabrics. Reducing
parachute equipment weight is a known concern and was expressed at the
most recent General Officer Integrated Product Review Meeting. Joint
Precision Airdrop Delivery System (JPADS) 2k and 10K, Maneuverable
Canopy 6 (MC6) Personnel Parachute System and Advanced Tactical
Parachute System (T11) are Programs on Record that have established
Pre-Planned Product Improvements in place to decrease system weight and
increase accuracy. For MC6 and T11 parachute canopies, reducing the
weight of the fabric by a factor of two would reduce the weight of the
canopy by 13% and 17% respectively. In addition to full-scale
parachutes, lightweight and flexible fabrics also have applications for
fabrication of small-scale parachute models for wind tunnel
testing.There are number of fabrics currently in use with parachute
systems depending on the purpose of the parachute. For unguided
parachutes, high permeability (90-200 cfm) nylon fabrics are used such
as PIA-C-7020, Type II and PIA-C-7350, Types I &amp;amp; II, these
fabrics range in weights from 1.6 to 3.5 oz\/yd2.&amp;nbsp; For guided
parachute systems, low permeability fabrics (0.5-3.0 cfm) such as
PIA-C-44378, Types IV &amp;amp; VI and PIA-C-7020 Type I are used. These
 fabrics are woven with ripstop, twill, or hybrid ripstop\/twill weaves.
 A goal of 50% weight reduction is preferred, although lesser reduction
levels will be considered. It is desired to reduce the cost of the new
lightweight material to levels lower than the cost of current nylon
fabrics. Besides the significant reduction in weight, the newly
developed material should have mechanical properties which are similar
or better than the existing parachute fabrics such as break strength,
elongation, durability, flexibility, chemical resistance, stability to
water immersion, air permeability, etc. While the individual
requirements for the material properties are listed in the fabric
specification, if some parameters are not explicitly listed, the newly
developed lightweight material must meet or exceed the performance of
the current nylon fabrics used in parachutes. For example, although
there is no abrasion resistance requirement in the PIA-C-7020
specification, it is expected the new lightweight material should
achieve comparable or better performance as the current nylon material.
The lightweight material could be a replacement for current parachute
fabrics so the performance of the parachute system must be maintained or
 improved with the new material. It is essential that the developed
material also meet the requirements of the Berry
Amendment.&amp;nbsp;Recent advances in textile fiber production and
material fabrication make a 50% weight reduction in canopy cloth
plausible. Examples of these advances include nonwoven fabrics and
nanofibers. Nonwoven fabric design processes are now flexible and can
systematically vary fabric areal density and permeability. Candidate
processes include but are not limited to spunbonded, spunlaced, and the
combination of nanofiber meltblowing and electrospinning. Since fiber
stiffness depends on the fiber diameter, fabrics made from nanofibers
with diameter less than 1 micrometer should offer various degrees of
flexibility to match that of a full-scale parachute canopy. Therefore,
fabrication of fabrics made of nanofibers using nonwoven fabric
manufacturing technology appears to be a feasible approach to achieve a
flexible material with a low density and low permeability. It should be
noted that other solutions to this topic which are not fabrics (such as
films or membranes) will be considered.PHASE I: Develop novel fibers and
 innovative manufacturing technologies to fabricate a lightweight, high
strength flexible material for use as a parachute fabric. Primary focus
of this phase is developing a material with properties similar to Type
IV, PIA-C-44378 fabric with the exception of achieving lighter weights.
The objective is to reduce the weight by 50% while retaining the
strength, flexibility, permeability, and other properties of the
original fabric. Cost analysis should also be included to show the final
 cost for the new lightweight material is either reduced or match the
cost of the current parachute fabric. Evidence must also be provided
that the resulting fibers, fabrics, and\/or materials will meet Berry
Amendment requirements. Samples of the novel fibers and materials, if
available, should be delivered along with a detailed report of the
development and testing of the new lightweight material.PHASE II: Phase
II should include finalizing the material development from Phase I and
refine its properties to achieve the desired requirements. Examine the
material properties in detail and compare them with those of the current
 nylon fabric. Methods for increasing the production rates for the
material are to be developed during Phase II. The development of
additional materials which could match the performance of other
traditional fabrics (such as PIA-C-7020, Type I or PIA-C-7350, Type I)
while reducing their weight by a factor of 2 or more should also be
conducted during Phase II. It could be possible that a single new
lightweight material could replace multiple traditional parachute
fabrics thereby reducing the number of fabrics used in different
parachute designs. While fabrication of a parachute prototype is not
required during Phase II, evidence must be provided that traditional
canopy fabrication methods (i.e. sewing, stitching, etc) would be
compatible with the new lightweight materials or alternative fabrication
 methods must be demonstrated to build confidence that parachutes could
be fabricated from the new materials without a loss of the current
performance capabilities from the parachute system. For example, it
should be demonstrated that the strength of a seam in the new materials
would be comparable to a traditionally stitched seam in the current
nylon fabric. Detailed cost analysis must be provided for all developed
lightweight materials showing that the cost has either been reduced or
match current cost for the traditional parachute fabric which would be
replaced. Evidence must also be provided that the resulting fibers,
fabrics, and\/or materials will meet the Berry Amendment. Required Phase
 II deliverables include 100 yards (42-inch width) of the new material
and all pertinent material properties data along with a detailed report
of the results.PHASE III: Lightweight fabrics or materials are used
extensively commercially in the area of industrial filters, medical
hygiene, clothing, etc. In addition to making full scale and parachute
models, lightweight materials can also be used to make model tents for
wind load study, kites, model airships, etc. There are a variety of
dual-use applications that a Phase III can pursue.",

        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Information Systems,
Ground\/Sea Vehicles, Human SystemsOBJECTIVE:&amp;nbsp; To research,
develop, and demonstrate tools that could support tactical small unit
load planning and route selection.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; The
Army\u2019s small units (Infantry Company and below) will benefit from
decision applications that support mission planning and execution of
their operational tasks.&amp;nbsp; The selection of equipment to take on
 a mission and the selection of routes can be based upon numerous
factors that are quite complex, to include the METT-TC elements
(mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time
 available and civil considerations), work-rest cycles, Soldier
performance, resupply, contingency planning and terrain
analysis.&amp;nbsp; Terrain analysis is often further broken out by the
OACOK rubric, with the major elements including: Observation and Fields
of Fire, Avenues of Approach, Cover and Concealment, Obstacles, and Key
or Decisive Terrain.&amp;nbsp; Tools can be developed to support
execution of these interdependent tasks.&amp;nbsp;There are currently
several tools that have some applicability to load planning and route
selection, but they all have significant shortcomings for the Small Unit
 (SU).&amp;nbsp; Most planning is currently done using a paper map or
digital imagery from Falcon View, Google Earth or some other
source.&amp;nbsp; The unit leader must interpret this terrain data and
integrate it with other sources of information.&amp;nbsp; Force XXI
Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) provides battle command and
situational awareness information, but focuses on enemy locations and
higher echelon decision makers.&amp;nbsp; There are commercial mobile
applications that could be used for route planning for civilian
applications, but almost all focus on vehicle transportation.&amp;nbsp;
Commercial mobile application have little to no utility for the kind of
route planning that SU Soldiers\/Leaders in the battle space are
required to do (i.e. Soldiers rarely get to travel on improved roads,
they must be concerned with elevation and navigation in
under\/undeveloped areas, and they must conduct topographical analysis
to understand areas along the route that could provide ambush and or
attack opportunities for the enemy).&amp;nbsp; As a result, we know
there are shortcomings that need to be addressed in the following
areas:\u2022&amp;nbsp; Ability to conduct terrain analysis to accurately
 determine where Soldiers can move and the difficulty (energy cost)
associated with the movement\u2022&amp;nbsp; Linking the energy cost of
movement with resulting impacts on Soldier and SU performance of
critical cognitive and physical combat tasks\u2022&amp;nbsp; Estimating
time to arrival based upon load, terrain, Soldier state and other
parameters\u2022&amp;nbsp; Estimating impacts of terrain, load and other
 parameters on thermal burden and heat strain\u2022&amp;nbsp; Linking
key Personal Status (PERSTAT) parameters with ability to execute
missions that involve significant movement\u2022 &amp;nbsp;Ability to
use intervisibility tools to aid the SU leader in identifying areas of
cover and concealment and in identifying potential avenues of approach
and egressThis effort would research, develop, and demonstrate
methodologies and algorithms that enhance tools for load planning, route
 selection and in making changes during mission execution.&amp;nbsp; It
would also be desirable that the route and load planning tools be
compatible with and support the military planning process, e.g.
generation of Operation Order.&amp;nbsp; Potential approaches should
address the data, methodologies, algorithms, and validation audit
trail.&amp;nbsp; Proposals should identify how the proposed research
will advance the current state of the art.&amp;nbsp; The products should
 support development or improving battlefield and training decision
support applications focused on Soldier load issues.&amp;nbsp; The SU
leader is responsible for making the final decision and we are trying to
 provide actionable information (e.g. timely, accurate or more complete)
 in which to do so.&amp;nbsp; Elements that could be important to
execution of this work include:&amp;nbsp; identifying the SU leader
decisions that are to be supported, understanding user needs;
identifying the factors that are important; identifying, researching,
and developing methods of obtaining the data needed; developing user
interfaces that meet user needs; developing methodologies and computer
algorithms; providing the desired output in a useful form; and
addressing software and platform integration issues.&amp;nbsp; Since
validation is a critical issue, the algorithms and decision aid
application must accurately represent the intended real world phenomena
from the perspective of its intended use.&amp;nbsp; At this point, we
are assuming that the SU will have: intermittent network connectivity,
some resident computational capabilities, terrain databases, and some
form of display available to them.&amp;nbsp; At this time, it is not
clear if the products of this effort would be integrated with other
existing battle command systems, become a module in an integrated
application or be utilized as a stand-alone application.&amp;nbsp;PHASE
I:&amp;nbsp; Phase I will provide a proposed concept for the generation
of methodologies and algorithms that would be needed and could be
incorporated into an application to support load planning and route
selection at the SU level.&amp;nbsp; The focus should be on the METT-TC
and\/or OACOK elements.&amp;nbsp; This will include identifying a number
 of specific operationally relevant decisions and actions that could be
at least partially supported by a decision support
application.&amp;nbsp; The proposal should also show how the proposed
methodologies and algorithms would provide the SU leaders with useful
information to support his decision making.&amp;nbsp; As a result, it is
 important that verification and validation planning be initiated at
this stage.&amp;nbsp; It is desirable that algorithms be computationally
 efficient within a potential battlefield and training decision support
aid.&amp;nbsp; Any data needs and assumptions required by the concept to
 be compatible with a SU decision aid should be clearly outlined and
explained.&amp;nbsp; Phase I should also include identification and
discussion of additional operationally relevant algorithms that could
support equipment and route selection at the SU level.&amp;nbsp;Phase I
will perform a proof of concept that describes how one proposed concept
may be utilized within a ground Soldier battlefield decision support
aid.&amp;nbsp; Metrics in phase I will include:\u2022&amp;nbsp; The
usefulness of the methodology or algorithm to support load planning or
route selection across a range of situations,\u2022&amp;nbsp; The
applicability and utility of an initial methodology and algorithm to be
implemented within a decision application,\u2022&amp;nbsp; The degree
that it represents the important elements of the real world
(valid),\u2022&amp;nbsp; Documentation and ability to demonstrate the
methodology or algorithm,\u2022&amp;nbsp; Modularity and ability to be
incorporated into a route selection cost function that incorporates
other factors, and applicability of the selected approach to the
development of additional algorithms.PHASE II:&amp;nbsp; Phase II will
include research, design and implementation of multiple methodologies
and algorithms necessary in accordance with the topic
objective.&amp;nbsp; Knowledge elicitation may need to be conducted with
 tactical small unit SME\u2019s to ensure that critical real world
factors (i.e. METT-TC or OACOK) are identified and included in such a
way as to support the development of each methodology, to include the
necessary data elements and data structures.&amp;nbsp; In Phase II,
validation and verification will have to be addressed.&amp;nbsp; The
plan may also include how specific applications could be
developed.&amp;nbsp; A set of use cases that describe relevant military
operations or missions will be provided to guide research, methodology
development and support testing and experimentation.&amp;nbsp; The work
effort will lead to demonstration of the products developed in phase II
within an appropriate environment.&amp;nbsp;Other tasks include
documenting and delivering a report including all user needs
assessments, methodologies, algorithms, and any data structures or
software products necessary to support transition of the work to DoD
materiel developers.&amp;nbsp; The phase II report should also
demonstrate and document how algorithms may be transitioned to support
implementation into battlefield and training decision support
applications.&amp;nbsp; Metrics for this effort will include the number
of methodologies and algorithms developed, the degree to which they
represent the important elements of the real world, their potential
utility within the decision application, documentation and their ability
 to be demonstrated.&amp;nbsp; Other considerations include the degree
to which the algorithms are computationally efficient, can be modified
if additional factors need to be included, and can be implemented within
 appropriate decision applications of the governments\u2019
choosing.&amp;nbsp; Because we do not yet know if the products of this
effort will lead to a stand-alone system or be integrated within another
 system, compatibility is an important issue.&amp;nbsp; As a result, the
 architecture, modularity and interfaces are all important.PHASE III
DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: The developed methodologies and associated
implementation have commercial applications of these simulation products
 to proposed DoD materiel solutions whose goal is to provide
Soldier\u2019s applications that will support enhanced Soldier
situational awareness and improved decision-making.&amp;nbsp; Also,
there is potential application to future automated or semi-automated
ground Soldier battlefield systems, such as an Unmanned Ground
Vehicles.&amp;nbsp; Non military applications could relate to route
selection where there are common elements with tactical small unit
operations.",

Charger\/Storage Unit",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Ground\/Sea Vehicles,
Materials\/ProcessesACQUISITION PROGRAM: PEO Ground Combat
SystemsOBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative lightweight, rugged, durable,
high-efficiency battery charger\/storage unit (BCSU), capable of
continuous conversion of radiative environmental energy into usable
direct current (d.c.), to charge Soldier batteries at a rate of 20 W in
five hours (at night and in poor weather), while weighing much less than
 the&amp;nbsp; batteries it replaces.&amp;nbsp; The BCSU must involve
novel materials approaches, not traditional photovoltaics (PVs), to
harness radiative environmental energy (e.g., infrared, solar, THz) and
provide on-demand recharging of the Soldier\u2019s batteries in the
field under battle conditions, while fitting into the dismounted
Soldier\u2019s equipment.DESCRIPTION: The battery is as integral to the
Soldier\u2019s mission and equipment as his\/her firearm, and must
reliably power electronic functions.&amp;nbsp; To ensure that equipment
is always energized, extra batteries are carried into remote locations,
restricting Soldier mobility under dangerous conditions.&amp;nbsp;
Because current portable solar-powered PV battery chargers [1] operate
only under bright, sunny conditions (rare in Afghanistan), dismounted
Soldiers use them only as a lightweight, emergency back-up.&amp;nbsp; We
 propose a lightweight, reliable, portable BCSU to go beyond PV cells
(while building on their success) by using novel technologies to
efficiently convert environmental energy (e.g., infrared\/visible\/THz
energy from the Earth and other warm sources) into continuous (e.g.,
24-hour, under all weather conditions, nighttime, etc.) d.c. for
charging batteries.&amp;nbsp; The Army\u2019s Land Warrior concept
requires that Soldiers carry at least 12 2 lb. 100 W-h batteries over a
72-hour unsupplied mission, so the proposed BCSU must output at least 20
 W in order to recharge a battery in a reasonable amount of time (~5
hours).&amp;nbsp; The BCSU (which must be flexible and easily
rolled\/folded) would, after development, replace ~ 9 of these
batteries, requiring the Soldier to carry only 2-3 batteries (one always
 operating), considerably lessening the Soldier\u2019s load.&amp;nbsp;
The BCSU should weigh less than 4 lb. (the weight of one
commercially-available PV cell and one battery that it
replaces).Innovative, perhaps nanomaterials-based approaches (not
traditional PVs and infrared\/THz technology) will be considered for
this SBIR topic.&amp;nbsp; Higher efficiency conversion of radiative
environmental energy, potentially a very disruptive technology (since it
 permits rapid battery recharging), could be enabled by nanomaterials
such as plasmonic or dielectric nanoparticles for confining\/scattering
light within [2,3], or metallic nanopatterning for better contacting, a
semiconductor, improved quantum dots (QDs), polymer-based PVs with
variable bandgaps, thermophotovoltaics or thermoelectrics,
nanorectennas, etc.Commercial PV cells have efficiencies limited to 40%
at AM1.5 [4], due to their intrinsic bandgap (tuned to only one photon
wavelength).&amp;nbsp; QDs and \u201cnanorectennas\u201d are thought
capable of much higher efficiencies in the vis\/ir regime
[5,6].&amp;nbsp; QDs have demonstrated multiple exciton generation, one
route to very high efficiency, in the laboratory [5], and could convert
incident vis\/nir energy into an engineered infrared spectrum, which is
then harvested by a tuned absorber. A \u201cnanorectenna\u201d consists
of an antenna, coupled to a rectifying diode, working at the nanoscale
to convert incident vis\/ir light into direct current.&amp;nbsp;
Rectenna arrays are very efficient in the radio frequency regime and can
 be designed to resonate over any desired wavelength range (no bandgap)
[6].Because rectenna efficiency scales with incident power [7], it is
conceivable that power could be beamed to a small squad of Soldiers from
 nearby, if a new airborne platform and lightweight, portable receiver
could be developed.&amp;nbsp; Efficiency, and therefore charge time,
would be greater for this \u201cpower beaming\u201d.PHASE I: Research
and propose an innovative technology for a high-efficiency, radiative
energy-harvesting BCSU to generate 20 W of continuous power for 10 hours
 total under all relevant weather conditions and during both day and
night, from radiative environmental energy and stored power.&amp;nbsp;
For example, the BCSU may be similar to a commercially available PV cell
 [1], with an additional coating\/electronics (negligible weight) to
harvest infrared environmental energy.&amp;nbsp; The BCSU must weigh
less than 4 lb., and must be conveniently carried in a rucksack (if a
\u201croll-away\u201d, like PV cells, that roll out into a flat area
&amp;lt; 2 m2 in area like in Ref.[1]) or on a Soldier\u2019s helmet (in
 which case the BCSU must be less than 100 cm2 in area, sufficiently
flexible to mount on a helmet, and not produce a visible signal when
illuminated), be reliable, and be realistically
manufacturable.&amp;nbsp; Consider nanomaterials-based technologies,
such as nanoparticles to enhance scattering, quantum dots,
nanorectennas, thin film supercapacitors, etc.&amp;nbsp; Traditional PVs
 will not be considered. Mitigate risk by identifying and addressing the
 most challenging technical hurdles in order to establish viability of
the technology (including proper thermal coupling of the BCSU to the
environment to ensure continuous, efficient energy conversion from the
environment).&amp;nbsp; Perform proof-of-principle experiments in a
laboratory environment, and predict the BCSU\u2019s efficiency at
AM1.5.&amp;nbsp; Provide credible projections of performance, size,
weight, energy requirements, and cost of a system suitable for
fielding.&amp;nbsp; Power beaming is acceptable only if the target is
large, lightweight (carried by one person), and can receive sufficient
power from approximately \u00bc mile away.&amp;nbsp;Physical

energy-harvesting, lightweight, portable BCSU harvesting energy under
all environmental conditions, and demonstrate 20 W continuous output
over a 10-hour period (minimum total 200 W-h stored energy) in the
field. The BCSU must be sufficiently mature for technical and
operational testing, limited field-testing, demonstration, and display.
Determine the appropriate technology for the BCSU, and characterize its
efficiency at AM1.5.&amp;nbsp;Characterize and refine the performance of
 the BCSU in accordance with the goals in the description
above.&amp;nbsp; Deliver a report documenting the theory, design,
component specifications, performance characterization, and
recommendations for optimizing the BCSU\u2019s efficiency and power
output.&amp;nbsp; Address manufacturability issues related to full-scale
 production for military and commercial utilization within applicable
systems.&amp;nbsp; Predict and optimize the usage cycle of the BCSU;
i.e., how many times these battery chargers can be used in the field,
without resupply.&amp;nbsp; Provide user manuals and training to support
 government testing of this equipment.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III: The BCSU
developed in Phases I and II will be the first high-efficiency
energy-harvesting battery charger that meets military standards (i.e.,
recharges at the rate of 20 W in 5 hours ten times before resupply).
Phase III will develop, through technology transition and\/or
commercialization, the full battery charging and storage system required
 for the dismounted Soldier to recharge batteries.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
This reliable, portable, low-weight flexible battery-charging and
storage system must be manufacturable at a reasonable cost.&amp;nbsp; In
 general, efficient conversion of solar and infrared energy into
electrical energy is one of society\u2019s most important technological
challenges, and solving this problem for the Soldier would enable
commercialization of efficient, inexpensive solar and infrared energy
for the general public. TRL 8",

imposed on the aviators by the mechanics of conventional Unmanned Aerial
 Systems (UAS) control techniques, and the cognitive difficulty of
integrating \u201cheads up\u201d local information from the manned
aviation platform with \u201cheads down\u201d information from the UAS.
Manned-unmanned (MUM) teaming combines "the inherent strengths of manned
 platforms with the strengths of UAS, which produce synergy not seen in
single platforms." (U.S. Army Roadmap for UAS 2010-2035, p.15) The Army
is moving toward a concept of robotic UAS wingmen to support and team
with manned aircraft, expanding sensor coverage and extending standoff
ranges. MUM teaming between manned and unmanned platforms requires new
methods for Army Aviators to task and maintain vigilance over
distributed unmanned assets. On-going efforts to develop the first
stages in this teaming between Manned Helicopters and Unmanned Air
Vehicles include programs like VUIT 2 and the Block 3 Apache.One of the
keys to transitioning to future concepts is the need to develop tools
for adding the needed automation and intelligent behaviors to the UAV
control systems necessary to keep workload low and create an intuitive
and predictable interface to the unmanned systems. Past efforts to
define and automate cockpits like in the Rotorcraft Pilot\u2019s
Associate Program have relied on significant knowledge acquisition
processes and software engineering efforts on the development of basic
structure and tasking architectures.&amp;nbsp; Although efforts to
develop mission tasking software for unmanned systems have been worked
for many years, they have tended to produce highly
\u201cengineering\u201d centric controls and displays and don\u2019t
flow well into an aviator\/warfighter centric planning and execution
toolset. The problem is that automation and tasking software that must
support and adapt to a changing tactical situations and tactics,
techniques and procedures (TTP) requires a complete reengineering and
architecting of the software.&amp;nbsp; To make automation and aiding in
 cockpits more adaptable and evolve to meet future needs, a better means
 of defining and adapting cockpit system automation is needed.What is
needed to make unmanned systems more assessable and useful is to develop
 a cockpit-ready mission oversight mechanism for an Army Aviator to task
 distributed unmanned assets for key Army unmanned missions (such as
ISR, logistics, counter-UAV, etc.). The effort should build upon the
Army's experience with unmanned mission control and should take a form
that is appropriate for cockpit environments (see reference 4 for
examples). Critical to the success of manned\/unmanned teaming is the
ability for unmanned assets to be tasked from manned vehicles in such a
way as to expand the capabilities of the manned asset beyond just
extending range of sensors. Critical challenges include maintaining
aviator awareness of distributed asset mission status in flight,
supporting the coordination of multiple unmanned assets in a variety of
simultaneous activities, and providing efficient control capabilities to
 the Army Aviator while minimizing the impact on workload.This effort is
 seeking to develop a software toolkit that will enable Army system
developers, tacticians, and aviators to define and tailor cockpit
automation, aiding, and tasking associated with mission planning,
coordination, and execution to facilitate optimal usage of unmanned
systems within an evolving mission context.&amp;nbsp; It is envisioned
that such a toolkit to define aiding, tasking, and automation within a
cockpit would ultimately have significant benefit beyond the management
of unmanned assets and it is hoped would lead to broader use of
automation within the Army. The interface for the toolkit needs to be
designed to be intuitive to both aviators and tactician.&amp;nbsp; It
should maintain sufficient oversight and constraints by the software
such that it keeps them within system specification and incorporates
good human factors. When used to define new tasking and automation or
modify existing sets of tasking to incorporate changes in tactics, the
system needs be able to validate the behaviors through some level of
automation possibly through simulation and \/or analysis.&amp;nbsp; The
Aviator side of the software will need to work within current planning
and cockpit systems while permitting the aviator the ability to easily
tailor and modify the mission plan and automation in an intuitive
Aviator centric manner. This software toolkit should be able to work
with existing systems onboard and off board the aircraft as defined by a
 systems developer and then integrate the utilization of sensors and
payloads of both air and ground unmanned systems as part of an overall
mission planning system. This effort should focus on developing
intuitive means for defining monitors, cues, and automating tasks to aid
 the management of unmanned systems throughout an aviator\u2019s
mission. Specific areas where it is envisioned such aiding software
would be beneficial and where the contractor shall develop a tasking
system for include the following: 1) to identify and assess available
unmanned assets in an area; 2) conduct planning and set cues to put
assets on station; 3) manage the asset and maintain awareness of the
unmanned system while being utilized by the aviator; and, 4) coordinate
basic system management and safety issues with the owner of the unmanned
 asset as they arise. This effort is not seeking to develop all the
mission specific behaviors for unmanned system utilization by an army
aviator but rather develop a set of tools usable at many echelons for
defining them both on the general mission templates at command level and
 to define and tailor them to mission specific requirement by
aviators.To simplify the UAS and payload control interface, the
government will provide at contract award the UAS interface based on the
 UAS PO Interoperability Profiles (IOP) which are based on STANAG 4586.
Other standard interfaces for accessing communications, determining
available unmanned assets in the field, and setting up control shall be
used as identified with commercial\/open standards filling in where
appropriate military standards do not yet exist.PHASE I:&amp;nbsp; The
contractor shall conduct a trade study analysis to look at technologies
options associated with architecting the system.&amp;nbsp; The
contractor will use simple mission scenarios and available training
material to help scope and develop requirements for the system. The
contractor shall conduct a task analysis of potential Aviator and UAS
operations to define the scope of tasks and functions that their toolkit
 must be able to define. The contractor shall develop a proof of concept
 demo suitable for user review\/assessment for key components both
tacticians and aviators.PHASE II:&amp;nbsp; Develop a graphic user
interface (GUI) appropriate for aviators in both pre-mission and
real-time environments to conduct planning, automating and monitoring
for unmanned system. Develop software architecture and interfaces for
the key unmanned air vehicles using the UAS PO Interoperability
profiles. Coordination with helicopter and unmanned system developers is
 encouraged enabling compatibility with current Army aviation systems.
If appropriate system definitions are not available then appropriate DoD
 and Industry standards can be substituted. The system shall ultimately
be assessed at 2 levels: 1) an assessment of system to define useful
mission behaviors in a command and control environment and 2) and
assessment of the planning and execution system to meet mission needs in
 simulated aviator environment.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III:&amp;nbsp; This
technology should have a broad application to all Army and DOD aviation
system. Like Kiowa Warrior, Apache, Special Ops 60s, and be able to
support unmanned aviation systems, such as Shadow, Raven, Fire Scout,
etc. A mission specific planning and execution system like this would
have a wide variety of commercial applications such as HLS, Border
Patrol, Police Departments, forestry service, and also could prove to be
 an enabler making unmanned systems operate more cooperatively and make
them much more flexible to adapt to new applications.",

 accordance with section 3.5.b.(7) of the solicitation.OBJECTIVE:
Develop low-profile, wideband antennas for SATCOM systems located on
airborne ISR Army platforms with an emphasis on reverse link data rate
improvement and radome height reduction.DESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; There is a
 critical need for miniaturized advanced concept SATCOM antenna designs
to improve size, weight and power (SWAP) and provide greater mounting
flexibility on airborne Army Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms.&amp;nbsp; Development is needed to
advance the state-of-the-art to enable bi-directional high data rates
(minimum of 4.0 Mb\/s target of 10.0 Mb\/s) capable of handling imagery
and communications intelligence (IMINT, COMINT) in standard Military
bands.&amp;nbsp; In order to reduce aircraft drag count, provide
mounting flexibility, improve on-station loiter time and reduce
operating and support (O&amp;amp;S) cost, and provide substantially
improved mission bandwidth, it is necessary that the size of these
antennas be dramatically smaller than similar SATCOM antennas in use
today for these applications.&amp;nbsp; Novel approaches to all aspects
of antenna design and performance are sought.&amp;nbsp; Antenna concepts
 should support both transmit and receive functionality with linear
(vertical and horizontal) and circular (left and right-handed)
polarization and sufficient realized gain to communicate with commercial
 satellites and military satellites from airborne Army ISR
platforms.&amp;nbsp; The target beamwidth should be less than 2 degrees
to satisfy Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) regulations operating at full power
&amp;amp; dates rates. Future electromagnetic modeling of the antenna on
 a specific aerial platform could be necessary to account for pattern
and impedance distortion caused by the interactions between the antenna
and the conducting and dielectric structures on the platform.&amp;nbsp;
By using electromagnetic analysis computer codes and approximate models
of the platforms-of-interest (POI), the simulated radiation performance
of the antenna can be calculated.&amp;nbsp; If successful, this effort
will produce a novel SATCOM antenna system that will result in
significant fuel cost savings for both military and commercial aerial
platforms and enhanced battlefield communications and situational
awareness for the Army due to its lower profile, high data rate and
multiband functionality.PHASE I:&amp;nbsp; Develop multiple design
concepts, conduct a trade study, and identify the 3 most promising
concepts for antennas that show promise in meeting the description
above.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Analyze and report expected RF
performance of these design concepts through electromagnetic
simulation.&amp;nbsp; Identify risks and approaches for reducing risk
toward effecting these designs.PHASE II:&amp;nbsp; Conduct risk
mitigation activities identified in Phase I then fabricate and
demonstrate proof-of-concept for the most promising prototype antenna
design(s) from Phase I.&amp;nbsp; Measure the RF performance (bandwidth,
 gain, radiation pattern etc.) both standalone and on a simulated, or
surrogate, military platform to validate the proof of concept design.
Update Phase I risks and approaches to risk reduction and complete a
preliminary design for an aircraft mounted SATCOM antenna as described
in the Description.&amp;nbsp; Conduct risk reduction activities to
respond to the top two risks for the new preliminary design.PHASE
III:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Complete risk reduction activities identified
in Phase II then complete design, integration, and fabrication of the
advanced concept SATCOM antenna for a specific Army Aviation
Platform.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Plan for and conduct developmental and
operational testing of the advanced concept SATCOM antenna.&amp;nbsp;
Transition this antenna technology onto 1) Army Airborne ISR (AISR)
RC-12 twin engine turbo prop platforms such as the Enhanced Medium
Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS), and Guardrail
Common Sensor, 2) the larger four engine Airborne Reconnaissance Low
(ARL), 3) general aviation single and multi-engine military and
commercial aircraft,&amp;nbsp; and 4) Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs)
such as&amp;nbsp; the low-to-medium altitude Predator B UAS that may be
found in Homeland Security and military AISR programs.&amp;nbsp; The
resulting fuel cost savings from lowered aircraft drag and enhanced data
 rates will attract both the Military and the Commercial sectors to
procure and productize the antenna technology.",

        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Space Platforms,
WeaponsACQUISITION PROGRAM: PEO Missiles and SpaceOBJECTIVE: There is no
 single propulsion cycle in existence that combines the high speed
performance of a ramjet and low speed, or static performance of a solid
rocket motor.&amp;nbsp; This topic seeks to develop unconventional
technologies for such a revolutionary new type of high speed ram air
propulsion system with both static and ram air capability.&amp;nbsp;
This new technology must meet or exceed the current performance and
operational envelope of existing, conventional, state of the art ram air
 and solid rocket propulsion technology, and must support both current
and future weapons systems and space platforms.&amp;nbsp; This effort
will require innovative research and advancements in combustion
techniques, combustion modeling, materials, and combustion
processes.&amp;nbsp; The contractor must analytically prove the
effectiveness of the advanced combustion technology using new modeling
and simulation techniques and subsequently deliver the analytical
combustion models, codes, and simulations to the Army to support missile
 feasibility studies.DESCRIPTION: The Army needs increased range and
loiter time for certain munitions, such as the Guided Multiple Launch
Rocket System (GMLRS) for the Program Executive Office, Missiles and
Space Precision Fires Rockets and Missiles Systems Project Office.
Conventional high speed ram air propulsion systems offer supersonic,
long range and limited loiter capability but are typically limited to
operation above Mach 2.5.&amp;nbsp; They do not produce thrust at static
 flight speeds.&amp;nbsp; Other propulsion cycles develop thrust at
static or very low flight speeds, but do not have the required fuel
efficiency of the high speed ram air propulsion technologies.&amp;nbsp; A
 single, revolutionary propulsion system that operates through a wide
range of subsonic and supersonic velocities is needed.&amp;nbsp; Such a
system does not presently exist and would be ideal to extend range or
provide extended capability to long range, high speed munitions. This
topic seeks to develop new propulsion technologies and simulations of a
revolutionary propulsion system that will operate at zero flight speed,
such as needed for launch, as well as at conventional ramjet equivalent
flight speeds of at least Mach 2.5. For this topic, a new, novel
propulsion technology must be conceived, mathematically modeled and
delivered, and should address in detail the revolutionary engine
concept&amp;nbsp; intended to maximize static and conventional high
speed performance.PHASE I: The contractor shall create a new, innovative
 technology and concept plan for a new type of high speed ram air
propulsion technology that provides thrust at static operating
condition, as well as flight speeds above Mach 2.5. The contractor shall
 develop a preliminary mathematical analysis plan of the statically
operated ram air propulsion technology and describe the specific methods
 used to predict performance.&amp;nbsp; The contractor must begin to
create and author new modeling codes to describe the revolutionary
process. The contractor shall develop a baseline reference configuration
 of a statically operated but yet high speed capable ram air propulsion
technology for use in their initial modeling and analysis.&amp;nbsp;
Deliverables for Phase I will be the concept plan for a statically
operated ram air propulsion technology, as well as the preliminary
software, architecture, mathematical analysis and proof of the
system.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The statically operated ram air propulsion
technology should be capable of a minimum Specific Impulse of 250
seconds, both statically and at conventional flight speed of at least
Mach 2.5, and a minimum thrust to weight ratio of no less than 4.PHASE
II: The contractor shall execute their plans developed in Phase I for
modeling, simulating, analyzing, and predicting the performance of the
statically operated, high speed ram air propulsion technology. The
reference configuration developed in Phase I will be modeled and
optimized into a final, high fidelity performance analysis by the
contractor.&amp;nbsp; Deliverables of Phase II are a prototype concept
design, performance prediction algorithms and mathematical analysis to
confirm the modeling assumptions used in the analysis. The mathematical
model of the revolutionary propulsion technology will be delivered
including all software, reference data, example cases, source codes,
compilation and make files, executable files, and a user\u2019s
guide.PHASE III: The end state of the research may yield a next
generation, high speed ram air propulsion technology for use in GMLRS or
 other similar system. The modeling and simulation codes developed under
 the SBIR, and used to describe the statically operated ram air
propulsion technology will be viable commercial products for the
contractor. The contractor may ultimately sell a full scale, high speed,
 statically operated ram air propulsion system in the role of a
propulsion contractor or subcontractor.",

Incidence Anti-Reflection Coatings",

Materials\/ProcessesACQUISITION PROGRAM: PEO Missiles and SpaceThe
technology within this topic is restricted under the International
Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), which controls the export and import
of defense-related material and services. Offerors must disclose any
proposed use of foreign nationals, their country of origin, and what
tasks each would accomplish in the statement of work in accordance with
section 3.5.b.(7) of the solicitation.OBJECTIVE: Design, develop and
demonstrate robust nanostructured high performance anti-reflection
coatings that allow over 98.5% transmission over a broad visible
spectral range with cone angles up to 120 degrees.DESCRIPTION: Soldier
warfare requires the accurate detection, recognition and identification
of possible targets for engagement without giving away one\u2019s
position to the enemy.&amp;nbsp; As such, soldiers rely on optical
sighting systems to identify targets while maintaining stealth
movement.&amp;nbsp; Anti-reflection coatings are applied to these
optical systems to serve a dual purpose.&amp;nbsp; First, reflections
from the front lens of the optical train can alert enemy troops to the
soldier\u2019s position.&amp;nbsp; An example of this phenomenon can be
witnessed when the sun glints off the windows of a distant mountain home
 to reveal its presence in an otherwise unnoticeable location.&amp;nbsp;
 A famous example of a glint-induced casualty is exemplified by Gunnery
Sergeant Carlos Hathcock, who shot a Viet-Cong sniper after locating the
 glint from his scope.&amp;nbsp; Secondly, anti-reflection coatings are
applied to maximize the transmission throughput of the optical
device.&amp;nbsp; By maximizing the transmission throughput, lens
apertures can be minimized and overall system sizes can be kept
small.&amp;nbsp; Small arms weapon systems are already heavy in nature,
therefore it is important to resist adding additional weight to these
weapons in the form of large optical sighting systems, so that there is
no reduction in the soldier\u2019s combat ability.Current
anti-reflection coatings suffer from transmission losses over broad
fields-of-view.&amp;nbsp; As the light source moves from being directly
in front of the system to off to the side of the system, the coating
spectral properties tend to \u201cblue shift.\u201d&amp;nbsp; In other
words, the light transmitted through the coating will shift towards
lower wavelengths.&amp;nbsp; If this shift is large enough, critical
spectral transmission may be lost, causing either unwanted reflections
from the front lens or loss of spectral resolution through the
device.&amp;nbsp; In either case, soldier lethality is
compromised.&amp;nbsp; To minimize the off-angle glint potential, a
honeycomb-type anti-reflection device (ARD) is installed in front of the
 optic, to eliminate off-angle reflections.&amp;nbsp; However, these
ARDs reduce the amount of incident light by approximately 15% and reduce
 the overall viewing angle of the optic.&amp;nbsp; Both of the
aforementioned drawbacks limit the utility of the optic, and in some
operational environments may require a larger optic to accommodate the
reduced light transmission due to the ARD.&amp;nbsp; Increasing the size
 of the optic directly correlates to an increase in weight, further
burdening the warfighter.&amp;nbsp; In more extreme instances, the ARD
is completely removed from the optic to maximize the light throughput
and viewing angle, thus exposing the warfighter to a potential
glint-induced positional compromise.Nanostructured antireflective
coatings can eliminate the aforementioned high angle of incidence issues
 and alleviate the need for an ARD.&amp;nbsp; Nanostructured coatings
have been proposed for solar cell applications to eliminate the need for
 sun tracking while maintaining high quantum efficiencies.&amp;nbsp; In
other words, these nanostructured coatings allow for high light
transmission by eliminating the reflections at most angles of incidence,
 including the reflections at large angles.&amp;nbsp; It is envisioned
that the nanostructured technology can be utilized in optical sighting
systems to decrease both the off-angle reflections and overall optical
system sizes, while reducing the soldier\u2019s signature on the
battlefield without the use of ARDs.PHASE I: Using N-BK7 or equivalent
glass substrate, identify materials and methods for preparing
nanostructured anti-reflection coatings.&amp;nbsp; Spectral properties
shall be modeled and simulated for angular response.&amp;nbsp;
Small-scale proof-of-concept samples shall be produced with identified
materials and methods.PHASE II: Develop prototype anti-reflection
coatings with broadband visible transmission that demonstrate minimal
angular shift.&amp;nbsp; Coatings will be spectrally analyzed for
reflection properties from 0 degrees to 80 degrees.&amp;nbsp;
Cross-section imaging will be performed to show microstructure of
coating.&amp;nbsp; Coatings shall be developed to meet the durability
requirements of MIL-C-675 for immersion, adhesion and
abrasion.&amp;nbsp; Coatings are expected to operate from -65 degrees F
to +160 degrees F with no degradation.&amp;nbsp; Coatings should
withstand high relative humidity at elevated temperatures.&amp;nbsp;
Delivery of prototype parts on minimum 45 mm diameter substrates
required.&amp;nbsp; Investigation of transmission properties into the
short-wavelength infrared (1.4 to 3 \u00b5m) coatings shall be
evaluated.PHASE III: Develop large scale, sustainable processing
capabilities for anti-reflection coatings for a wide variation of
substrate materials and substrate sizes.&amp;nbsp; Dual use capabilities
 include digital camera lens coatings, solar panel coatings,
glasses\/spectacle coatings, and optical lens coatings for use with CCD
and FPA sensors.",

multi-band phased array antenna system for a nanosatellite
communications ground station with the capability to simultaneously
track and communicate with multiple nanosatellites in multi-plane low
earth orbit.DESCRIPTION: The Space &amp;amp; Missile Defense Command
responsive space technology program has been developed to meet the
space-related urgent needs of the warfighter in a timely manner. The
operational concept calls for responsive space satellites to augment or
reconstitute existing \u201cbig space\u201d systems. Nanosatellites with
 masses on the order of 10 kg (22 lbs) or less are receiving an
increasing level of attention within the national security community. A
large constellation of nanosatellites in multiple Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
orbital planes could provide persistent, UAV-like effects for
warfighters in one or more theaters. Moreover, multiple satellites would
 need to be simultaneously tracked and multiple communication bands are
envisioned to be employed by a single ground station with a single
antenna. However, the ground stations for these satellites currently
limit the capabilities of communicating with a constellation of
nanosatellites. Although technology for ground stations for the larger
Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite classes is mature, much less
development has been done towards ground stations for LEO satellites
that have much more demanding requirements for pointing and tracking. A
key area of need for tactically relevant military nanosatellite systems
is a robust stationary electronically steered antenna that gives
nanosatellite ground stations the ability to be transportable, reliable,
 and to transmit encrypted satellite commands as well as receive
encrypted nanosatellite telemetry. Current LEO ground station antennas
use large mechanically steered antennas which are single band, track one
 satellite at a time, have moving parts and lack the reliability,
mobility, and the pointing accuracy needed for the higher bands being
required for future military systems. Nanosatellite-sized phased array
ground station antenna units could significantly enhance the
functionality of nanosatellites for warfighters. A single electronically
 steered antenna is envisioned that can communicate with more than one
nanosatellite at a time and would have no moving parts. It would replace
 the current mechanically steered antennas and mechanical actuators
required to establish horizon to horizon links to nanosatellites.
Furthermore, a single electronically steered antenna could enable the
ground station to establish links in multiple bands to multiple
nanosatellites at a given time.Researchers into phased array antenna
innovations for nanosatellite ground station communications should take

conceptual approach to incorporating a Nanosatellite Ground Station
Communications Phased Array Antenna into a nanosatellite ground station
and include system estimates for mass, volume, power requirements, and

feasibility demonstration reports and any hardware produced.PHASE II:

should include initial Nanosatellite Ground Station Communications

demonstrated, including a demonstration of key subsystem phenomena.
Deliverables should include quarterly status reports, design
documentation and any hardware produced.PHASE III: The contractor shall
finalize technology development of the proposed nanosatellite ground

product. In addition to military communications or intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, commercial civilian
applications for a nanosatellite ground station phased array antenna
could include space-based satellite communications. Phase III should
solidly validate the notion of a nanosatellite ground station phased
array Antenna with a low level of technological risk. The goal for full
commercialization should ideally be Technology Readiness Level 9, with
the actual system proven through successful mission operations.
Specifically, Phase III should ultimately produce a nanosatellite ground
 station phased array antenna suitable for nanosatellite ground station
applications. The contractor must also consider manufacturing processes
in accordance with the president\u2019s Executive Order on
\u201cEncouraging Innovation in Manufacturing\u201d to insure that the
innovations developed under this SBIR can be readily manufactured and
packaged for transportation and deployment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;During
Phase III, this antenna could conceivably transition or expand to the
appropriate division of the Army Program Executive Office for Missiles
and Space (PEO M&amp;amp;S) upon full rate production and deployment.
PEO M&amp;amp;S could maintain a stockpile of nanosatellite ground
stations to responsively meet urgent warfighter needs. Simultaneously,
commercial versions of the nanosatellite ground station phased array
antenna innovations could be produced for civilian and scientific
applications. Commercial satellite manufacturers could incorporate them
into a variety of commercial satellite systems for sale to various
interested customers. Commercial companies could also provide
competitively priced nanosatellite-based communications or remote
sensing services to paying customers, including the national security
community.PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: There is a perceived
potential for commercialization of this technology. The primary customer
 for the proposed technology will initially be the Department of
Defense, but there could also be other applications in the areas of
commercial satellite communications.",

        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Air Platform,
SensorsACQUISITION PROGRAM: PEO Missiles and SpaceThe technology within
this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms
Regulation (ITAR), which controls the export and import of
defense-related material and services. Offerors must disclose any
proposed use of foreign nationals, their country of origin, and what
tasks each would accomplish in the statement of work in accordance with
section 3.5.b.(7) of the solicitation.OBJECTIVE: To develop a rugged
Adaptive Optics (AO) system which will enable Ultra-short Pulse Lasers
(USPL), femto second class, to deliver the maximum fluence on target,
without ionizing the atmosphere along the beam path, at tactically
significant distances under a wide variety of atmospheric turbulence
conditions.DESCRIPTION: USPL have achieved a level of reliability,
energy, size, efficiency, and ease of use which have made them
attractive for a wide variety of applications critical to DoD missions.
In particular, several Laser Guided Energy (LGE) applications have been
proposed, some of which include using laser-produced plasma channels for
 guiding high voltage discharges, remote sensing of chem\/bio agents
using supercontinuum or terahertz generation, plasma waveguides for
electromagnetic energy, and generic countermeasures. In all of these
applications, a common feature is the requirement to efficiently
transfer the very high (typically &amp;gt;10^12 Watts\/cm2) peak
intensity levels available with the USPL over distances ranging from
several tens of meters to many kilometers under a variety of atmospheric
 conditions. The reason for this, of course, is that the unique features
 of these lasers at such high intensities is their ability to induce
nonlinear responses in materials, including air, which result in
ionization, ultra-wideband frequency generation, and white light
generation, and to do so remotely and predictably. It is precisely this
aspect which demands the use of Adaptive Optics.&amp;nbsp; For this
project we require the adaptive optics be able to produce the maximum
fluence and ionization at a specific point in space while minimizing the
 ionization trail along the beam path.The atmosphere is not the
quiescent, benign medium it appears to be on a pleasant sunny day.
Temperature gradients result in index of refraction cells which cause
laser beams to break apart as if they were traveling through a series of
 lenses, and reduces the intensity on target since the beam now spreads
out. Aerosols from numerous sources can also cause scattering, reducing
the energy deposited on target, and thus, the intensity. Since all the
processes alluded to above are nonlinear, some of which depend on the
intensity raised to the eighth or ninth power, it is obvious that one
cannot tolerate these kinds of losses.AO uses low power light sources to
 determine the wavefront deviations near the path to be taken by the
higher power laser. Through a closed loop series of algorithms, a
deformable mirror (DM) compensates for these distortions such that the
beam travels through the atmosphere and arrives at the target with the
theoretical minimum spot size or highest achievable spatial resolution.
This technique is identical to that used in astronomy to correct for the
 aberrations that occur in the observation of distant stars
(twinkling).Several aspects of USPL make the choice and production of AO
 a challenge. First, typical USPL have relatively broad bandwidths due
to their short (less than 10^-12 seconds) pulse width. The deformable
mirror must not introduce uncorrectable dispersion in the beam, since
that would limit the available temporal width of the USPL. Second,
typical peak powers in these lasers are on the order of several
Terawatts. At these power levels, beams width diameters of mm size will
damage any material currently used in coatings. Therefore, the size of
the DM and number of actuators must be compatible with this limitation.
Third, since the requirement is to produce the minimum spot size
possible at a variety of distances during an engagement, the temporal
response of the DM as well as the time to process the wavefront data
from the guide star must be compatible with the change in the engagement
 range.&amp;nbsp; Of particular importance is the ability to maintain
the focusing ability on rapidly moving objects.PHASE I: Perform a trade
study of existing technology and components and compare the capabilities
 to the requirements stated above for minimizing plasma channel and
ionization except at the target point. The result of this study is to be
 a series of specifications and recommendations for an adaptive optics
system which can be used in existing LGE and USPL systems.
Demonstrations at this phase are encouraged if practical.PHASE II: Based
 on the results and findings of Phase I, demonstrate the technology by
fabricating and testing a prototype in a laboratory environment.
Assemble a proof-of-principle device and demonstrate the proposed
technology and its ability to signal an attack warning and to identify
its characteristics. Identify and address technological hurdles. The
proposed development and demonstration should be limited to what can be
demonstrated in a Phase II program and should identify the means
necessary to transition the technology.PHASE III: This technology could
be used in a broad range of military and commercial applications such as
 rapid remote chemical analysis. The final embodiment of this device
would be a standalone hardware package and set of specifications that
could be integrated into a mobile military platform.",

Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), which controls the export and import
of defense-related material and services. Offerors must disclose any
proposed use of foreign nationals, their country of origin, and what
tasks each would accomplish in the statement of work in accordance with
section 3.5.b.(7) of the solicitation.OBJECTIVE:&amp;nbsp; Develop and
demonstrate innovative tools, techniques or decision support frameworks
for the identification, tracking, and mitigation of risks associated
with malicious attacks on critical embedded information and
communications technology (ICT) within a weapon system supply chain
lifecycle.DESCRIPTION: As DOD has become increasingly dependent on
embedded information and communications technology (ICT) to conduct
mission operations, the need for assurance of ICT processing assets has
grown. The industrial base for these capabilities is composed of
global\u2014and, largely, non-U.S.\u2014suppliers that build, maintain,
and upgrade these assets. This reliance upon globally sourced ICT poses
unique challenges for acquisition program managers and contracting
officers because it exposes DOD systems and networks to an increasing
risk of exploitation. These concerns have led Congress to support DOD
efforts to develop systemic approaches to managing the risk by focusing
on key acquisition programs.In January 2008, National Security
Presidential Directive 54\/Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23
and the National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) were launched. They
were mutually reinforcing initiatives with major goals designed to
secure the United States in cyberspace. The CNCI includes the supply
chain risk management (SCRM) initiative, which is the basis for DOD
policy directing that supply chain risk will be addressed early and
across the entire life cycle to manage ICT integrity within covered
systems.&amp;nbsp; The policy will require the services and government
agencies to put measures in place to respond to this concern. Addressing
 this threat to DoD systems and networks will require access to
information and effective use of that information. The supplier network
for a weapon system for example, can be quite large. The larger the
supplier network, the larger the risk. Multiple threat vectors are
possible. Being able to visualize and manage the threat based on system
priority, component criticality levels, available counter-intelligence
data, etc, is essential for mission assurance.This focus of this topic
is to develop tools, techniques and decision support frameworks that
will assist key stakeholders in identifying, tracking, and mitigating
risk throughout the supply chain lifecycle.&amp;nbsp; Weapon system
critical data, hardware, software, firmware, services and system
infrastructure are subject to malicious attacks and new techniques are
needed to quickly, accurately and reliably identifies threats throughout
 the lifecycle and integrate this information in an easily understood
manner so key stakeholders can make informed decisions.&amp;nbsp;
Existing supply chain risk management techniques do not specifically
address the unique threats associated with embedded information and
communications technology.&amp;nbsp;The goal is a global picture of the
supply chain network that will provide a common interface to assimilate
the relevant data and effectively manage and report on the threat within
 a specific system.&amp;nbsp; New tools, techniques and decision support
 frameworks that address the uniqueness of the information and
communication technology aspects of the supply chain support this goal
and will increase the likelihood of mission success.Innovative solutions
 are being sought, but not limited to, the following specific areas that
 support the identification, tracking, and mitigation of risk associated
 with attacks on the information and communications technology aspect of
 the supply chain:1) geospatial visualization of the supply chain
network specific to a system and the ability to integrate that
information from current available sources where they exist2) component
criticality identification and analysis3) counter-intelligence
information integration4) component (i.e., bios, firmware) integrity
analysis5) secure portals and frameworks for data assimilation and
integrationThe technology developed or utilized for this topic should be
 innovative, collaborative and secure.&amp;nbsp; Collaboration is fast
becoming a fundamental component in today\u2019s solutions. The ability
to share information securely and efficiently is expected.PHASE I: 1)
Research and develop tools, techniques, or decision support frameworks
that assist in supply chain risk management for information and
communication technology of weapon systems.&amp;nbsp; 2) Provide a
proof-of-concept prototype demonstrating the feasibility of the
concept.PHASE II: Based on the results from Phase I, refine and extend
the design into a fully functioning pre-production prototype.PHASE III:
Develop the prototype into a comprehensive solution for the application
of supply chain risk management. This capability would not only benefit
DoD weapon and support systems, but also commercial organizations.",

 Non-lethal weaponization of ultra-short pulse (pico-femtosecond) laser
systems to produce laser induced plasma detonation (LIPD) in air or on
material targets in close proximity to targeted humans.&amp;nbsp;
Current LIPD systems are capable of producing some optical out-put and a

 amphibious ships, without modifying the ships or the
vehicles.DESCRIPTION: System that meets heavy weather requirements for
securing existing vehicles to existing ship decks while reducing broken
stow (target broken stow is 20%). Solution must be a product that is
lightweight, easily handled, low maintenance and compatible with a
salt-water environment. (Broken stow is the ratio of unusable deck space
 on (due to cargo tie-down configuration, or etc) to total deck space.
Broken stow represents lost opportunity to carry additional vehicles,
impacting our warfighters. Broken stow is affected by lashing\/tie-down
requirements, configuration and lashing material used.)Tie-down
standards (number of tie-down provisions and G-force criteria) for
vehicles and equipment are outlined in Military Standard 209K. A
tie-down configuration that meets heavy weather requirement results in a
 broken stow of approximately 70%. 70% broken stow reduces the equipment
 a MEU can transport too much to be effective.Instead, a typical current
 tie-down configuration utilizes 4 tie-downs from vehicle to the deck;
each is 2-4 ft long, 90 degrees (from the longitudinal axis) and 30-60
degrees (from the vertical axis). Utilizing this configuration results
in a broken stow factor of approximately 35%, but it does not meet heavy
 weather requirements. Typical lashing material is chains with strength
ranging from 15,000 lbs to 70,000 lbs. The chains are heavy (weighing up
 to 90 lbs each), cumbersome and labor intensive.One approach would be
to develop a restraint that can run from attachment points on the deck
under the vehicle to the vehicle attachment points. The challenge with
such an approach is to design something that can be employed by a
service member in the limited space under a military vehicle.Proposers

tracked and wheeled vehicles designed to operate over harsh off-road
terrain, oceans and riverine environments. Generally the design of a
vehicle is subject to competing requirements: 1) mobility, 2) combat
effectiveness and carrying capacity, and 3) survivability. All vehicles
undergo tests to determine specification compliance and survivability
using direct and indirect fire weapons, explosive charges, IED\u2019s
etc. Current trends in vehicle survivability are directed towards a base
 armor with modular appliqu\u00e9 systems available for increased
protection geared towards specific threats.&amp;nbsp; With the myriad of
 configurations of materials available it is desired that desktop
software be developed for the evaluation of vehicles subjected to
explosions and ballistic impact.&amp;nbsp; Currently several
organizations such as DARPA, ARL and NSWC are working on software
development.&amp;nbsp; However this work is for hydrocode (finite
element) applications such as CTH, LS-DYNA and ANSYS.&amp;nbsp; Current
state of the art finite element software require days to weeks to
develop a model and require a minimum of an hour to complete one
configuration (very simple model).&amp;nbsp; This is the drawback to
using finite element models for initial screening of designs.&amp;nbsp;
This software is to be used as a design tool able to execute multiple
iterations i.e. armor configurations on a desktop or laptop computer and
 should include the acceleration effects to the vehicle in a short time
period compared to 6 finite element analyses.&amp;nbsp; It is envisioned
 that this application would utilize a spreadsheet as its basic
operating system.&amp;nbsp; The first-order design tool is to screen
designs solutions so that more detailed finite element analyses can be
limited to the most promising designs..&amp;nbsp; In all cases the
software will permit iteration on input parameters.The desired
capabilities are as follows:&amp;nbsp;1. Estimate V50 and Vxx (V0, V90,
V100, etc.) and penetration depth of irregular fragments, projectiles
and Fragment Simulating Projectiles (FSP) into various materials used in
 armor constructions.&amp;nbsp;2.&amp;nbsp; Estimate crater dimensions
from charge weight and depth of burial or estimate charge weight and
depth of burst from crater dimensions.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;3.&amp;nbsp;
Estimate pressure and impulse time histories for both free air and
hemispherical surface bursts.4.&amp;nbsp; Compute blast forces over a
2-D shape, produce side-on and reflected pressure and impulse
histories.&amp;nbsp; Produce 3-D plots and animations of the
blast.5.&amp;nbsp; Estimate exterior ballistics data using
3-degree-of-freedom calculations for irregular fragments, projectiles
and FSPs in order to produce plots of the output.6.&amp;nbsp; Estimate
plate deflection for homogeneous metals, the likelihood of plate
fracture, and the response of a virtual accelerometer placed anywhere on
 the structure due to blast.&amp;nbsp; Produce plots and animations of
the response.PHASE I:&amp;nbsp; The contractor shall conduct research

tactical form-factor, such as a hand-thrown grenade or 40mm-muntion have
 not been successful as the chemical composition is highly
volatile.&amp;nbsp; A malodorant weapon could therefore be created by
two means: 1) Developing a sealing or encapsulation technique capable of
 preventing leaks of the government developed malodorous payload 2)
Developing a new malodorous payload.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I:&amp;nbsp; If a
new payload is proposed, develop and submit IRB protocols for two
sequential experiments.&amp;nbsp; The first will use a lateralization
test to determine the threshold at which trigeminal nerve activation
occurs.&amp;nbsp; The second will determine the effectiveness at
repelling human subjects from an area at concentrations below the
established threshold.&amp;nbsp; Perform these two tests.If it is
proposed to use the government developed malodorous payload, develop and
 submit an IRB protocol to determine the effectiveness at repelling
human subjects from an area at concentrations below the established
threshold.&amp;nbsp; Perform this test.Using the results of these tests,
 determine the feasibility of using malodorants to remove individuals
from enclosed spaces.&amp;nbsp; Estimate the number of munitions
required t0 generate effective concentrations in an enclosed 5m x 5m x
3m space.PHASE II:&amp;nbsp; Develop and demonstrate an initial
prototype of a malodorant munition that does not leak payload despite
the shock expected from transportation and handling in military
environments.&amp;nbsp; Show concentration measurements as a function of
 time and area\/volume denied.PHASE III:&amp;nbsp; Develop and test a
mature prototype in a relevant military environment.&amp;nbsp;

PMS 406 Unmanned Influence Sweep System Program of Record - ACAT
IIIOBJECTIVE:&amp;nbsp; To develop an optical perception system for
unmanned surface vessels (USVs) to support the lookout function as
defined by COMDTINST M16672.2D, \u201cNavigation Rules\u201d Rule
5.Transition Path:&amp;nbsp; Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mine Warfare
Mission Package: Unmanned Influence Sweep System (UISS) and other Navy
USVs under PEO LMW PMS420 Unmanned Maritime Systems Program
OfficeDESRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; The Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) at the
heart of the UISS is required to follow Navigation Rule 5: \u201cEvery
vessel shall at all times maintain a proper look-out by sight and
hearing as well as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing
circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the
situation and of the risk of collision.\u201d Since the vessel is
unmanned, the lookout function must be supported by a perception system
consisting of sensors and processing that provide situational appraisal
to a remote operator of the USV and to an onboard automated command and
control system.The current capability for providing the lookout function
 onboard the USV consists of a camera system, a radar and
microphone.&amp;nbsp; These provide only a rudimentary situational
awareness without sufficient data to enable appropriate action based on a
 full appraisal of the situation and the risk of collision.&amp;nbsp;
The focus of this topic is to develop an innovative optical sensor and
processor subsystem for the total perception processing
system.&amp;nbsp; The optical subsystem will provide a continuous 360
degree field of view, process the raw data and provide the contact
attributes as an output to an operator or an onboard autonomous control
system to support obstacle\/collision avoidance in accordance with
Navigation Rule 5.&amp;nbsp; Current state of the art optical perception
 systems do not meet the goals of USV operational needs with respect to
the Navigation Rules.&amp;nbsp; The Navy has reviewed and used a variety
 of optical technologies and strategies to provide USVs with optical
situational awareness (SA) and contact detection (CD), but to date these
 approaches lack the ability to satisfactorily capture images and
process the digital data, and fail to meet requirements with respect to
performance (stabilization, coverage, range, obstacle detection) and
environment (shock, water intrusion, green water impact).These existing
technologies, furthermore, are not suitable for supporting even basic
USV operation by a remote operator.&amp;nbsp; Existing technology simply
 overloads the operator with information.&amp;nbsp; A human onboard a
craft can quickly rotate to get a 360 degree appraisal of the
environment and is self stabilizing.&amp;nbsp; An operator behind a
remote console controlling a pan-tilt-zoom camera or switching between
multiple fixed camera views, as is required by current technology, is an
 extremely ineffective and fatiguing approach.&amp;nbsp; The processor
subsystem should collect all data from the sensor and process the data
into a useable output format.&amp;nbsp; Output types would include
streaming video, still pictures of contacts of interest and contact
attribute data.Contacts may include all sizes of power and sailing
vessels, buoys and other navigation markers, structures on land
including light houses and floating, semi-submerged debris (log to ISO
container).&amp;nbsp; Attributes may include contact size, height to
length ratio, range, bearing and speed\/direction.&amp;nbsp; The
objective is to provide the contact attributes a person would need to
make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision.The
processor shall have the capability to detect navigation lights and day
shapes on other vessels (Navigation Rules, Part C) from the raw sensor
data and provide their attributes. The processor shall also have the
capability to detect and provide attributes of navigation aids such as
color, lights and shapes.Environmental effects must be taken into
account in developing the optical subsystem. These include water
intrusion\/impacts and craft motions. State of the art systems not been
operated in higher sea states and thus have not addressed such issues as
 motions, shock, vibration, water spray and water impact.&amp;nbsp; The
optical subsystem must be capable of both performing and surviving in
the intended environment.The subsystem must be able to receive
communications directing it, for example, to zoom in on an image or
replay a captured sequence.&amp;nbsp; This communication could come from
 a remote human operator or an onboard autonomous control system, both
of which will be receiving inputs from the radar and audio sensor
subsystems.&amp;nbsp; Such communications will allow the optical
subsystem to \u201cfocus\u201d both the optical sensor as well as
processing power on an indicated area.&amp;nbsp; This would be similar
to a human operator who hears something coming from a particular
direction and focuses in that direction.&amp;nbsp; Further development
and integration into a complete perception processing system could occur
 under Phase III, but it is only the intent of this topic to define such
 interfaces.Reference 1, slide 14, provides a picture of the USV and its
 principal hardware including the current navigation sensors.&amp;nbsp;
The desired camera subsystem should have a field of view (FOV) that
provides 360 degrees in the horizontal plane and be able to view
contacts on the water surface from within 10 yards (man in the water and
 larger) of the vessel to the horizon (12m long by 3m high and larger)
during operation, which includes significant vessel motions (e.g.,
incurred during sea state 3 operations) and operations in all visibility
 conditions (day, night, rain, snow, fog, etc.).&amp;nbsp; The processor
 shall have the capability to detect a contact on the water or shore
from the raw sensor data, and provide contact attributes.&amp;nbsp;
Maximum detection range for navigation aids, such as buoys, and other
vessels is two nautical miles and minimum detection range is 10
yards.&amp;nbsp; Determination of specific requirements for resolution
will be the responsibility of the proposer and shall be based on the
processors\u2019 requirements to perform contact detection as defined
below.&amp;nbsp; The camera subsystem would typically be mounted on an
arch approx 10\u2019 off the water, and is subject to sea spray, direct
sunlight and occasional green water impacts.This SBIR topic is not
soliciting the development of computer hardware technology as part of
the perception processing system.&amp;nbsp; Ruggedized computing systems
 exist on the market.&amp;nbsp; Environmental requirements can be met by
 either using a ruggedized computer able to directly handle the
environment or by repackaging the system (shock mounts, cooling,
etc.).&amp;nbsp; However, novel optical processing techniques and
technologies shall be used to minimize the required processing power and
 footprint.&amp;nbsp; Hardware selection shall address environmental
issues.&amp;nbsp; The processor would normally be installed below decks,
 in a relatively sheltered compartment not directly exposed to the
elements.PHASE I:&amp;nbsp; Complete preliminary design for the proposed
 optical sub-system. The design should include details on system
hardware and software architecture and should specify key system
components and their expected performance. Provide convincing evidence
of the feasibility of the system design to meet the objectives of the
topic. Perform bench top experimentation where applicable to demonstrate
 concepts.PHASE II:&amp;nbsp; Develop detailed hardware and software
design for the optical sub-system. Fabricate and test a prototype. In a
laboratory environment demonstrate that the prototype meets the
performance goals established in Phase I. Verify final prototype
operation in a representative environment and provide results. Develop a
 cost benefit analysis and a Phase III installation, testing, and
validation plan.PHASE III:&amp;nbsp; Construct a full-scale prototype
and install on board a selected combatant craft. Conduct extended
shipboard testing. Support transition and integration of the subsystem
into a full system, including radar and audio subsystems.PRIVATE SECTOR

greatly helped the maritime industry with regards to safe navigation,

and unmanned craft alike.",

this SBIR is to optimize fire control through innovative research and
development in machine cognitive decision theory to develop a fire
control decision engine that addresses the complexities associated with
the simultaneous engagement of multiple concurrent hostile torpedoes
while addressing the uncertainty dimensions and associated
constraints.DESCRIPTION: The Torpedo Warning System is a man-in-the-loop
 system that couples active and passive sonar components with a fire
control decision engine to engage incoming torpedoes with CATs. The
man-in-the-loop role is to apply situation awareness using a clear and
simple information display to validate automated torpedo alerts and to
make decisions concerning launch of CATs and ship\u2019s evasive
maneuvers. The actual fire control guidance to optimize CAT
effectiveness is automated. Current program-of-record fire control
solutions are built upon an explicit enumeration of inputs and behaviors
 where system designers attempt to anticipate all possible behaviors of
the system. This solution provides a base capability that is repeatable
and auditable, but not robust in the entire solution space. Recent
academic developments in the area of adaptive machine learning have not
been applied in this arena. This SBIR seeks research only in the
application of Adaptive Learning techniques to the TWS multi-target
problem. Machine learning systems adaptively improve with exposure to
the problem space. Evolutionary algorithms, genetic programs, classical
neural networks, spiking nets, and learning classifier systems seem
suitable to address this problem. This topic does not seek development
of all the technologies mentioned above but does seek the application of
 one or more of these implicit techniques to the Torpedo Warning System
(TWS) problem that is measurably superior to the program-of-record
approach. Small businesses will utilize modeled or simulated data based
upon publicly available information to develop the Adaptive Learning
approach through phase II. Given that learning systems provide limited
auditability, the proposed solution must prove to be deterministic in
the sense that, once deployed, the behavior in a given set of
circumstances must always be the same (repeatable).PHASE I: Develop
criteria concepts to discriminate amongst modern machine learning
approaches with applicability to Torpedo Warning System (TWS). Provide
recommended approach\/design for prototype system with Phase II program
plan.PHASE II: Develop prototype machine learning system based upon
results of Phase I, using simulated data. Develop Metrics and assess
relative performance of learning system against explicit enumerated
system.PHASE III: Provide development of a scalable system with
interfaces to Torpedo Warning System (TWS) and implement the recommended
 system developed under Phase II. Evaluate and demonstrate the
system\u2019s ability to augment the Torpedo Warning System
(TWS).PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS:

 Develop a battery energy, storage management\/electrical safety device
to ensure correct operation, prevention of abusive conditions and
storage system condition awareness pertaining to large rechargeable
energy storage systems.DESCRIPTION: Energy storage is an enabler for a
growing number of applications onboard Navy platforms to enhance
functionality and fuel savings.&amp;nbsp; In certain situations, an
energy storage device may serve as the primary power source for
operations, in other applications the device might be required to
monitor a distributed network of devices of various types which must
collectively work together in order to meet specific power
requirements.&amp;nbsp; Current battery management systems are disparate
 in nature, resident within the battery itself and typically only
perform minimal operational monitoring (voltage and temperature
cut-outs) of energy storage devices for the purpose of preventing
abusive conditions.&amp;nbsp; Regardless of application, safety and the
individual as well as collective condition awareness of the energy
storage devices which comprise an overall system are key areas of
technology need for which there is no currently available
solution.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Independent of host platform and
application, the management and monitoring of future energy storage
systems will need to be able to diagnosis and prognosis battery health,
identify and report anomalies associated with battery degradation, and
ultimately have the capability to provide forewarning of a potential
casualty event.&amp;nbsp;This topic seeks to explore innovative
approaches to the development of a Battery Management System (BMS)
device which would allow ships force the ability to control critical
parameters associated with thresholds of abusive or otherwise hazardous
or non-optimal conditions in energy storage architectures up to 1000 VDC
 minimum.&amp;nbsp; Proposed concept(s) should employ open architecture
design principles to enable the ability to be tuned to a variety of
secondary battery chemistries, device types (including the batteries,
energy storage capacitors, hybrid devices, etc. from different
manufacturers and of different sub-varieties (not associated with any
one type or manufacturer)) and architectures to provide awareness of the
 operational characteristics of the system on a cell-by-cell
basis.&amp;nbsp; A key technical challenge will be in the ability to
develop sophisticated algorithm(s) that will permit the integration of
relevant operational and physical data, which can be obtained from both
normal use and enhanced monitoring, while being able to&amp;nbsp;
determine changes in performance and forecast degradation and pending
failures within the energy storage system or a singular cell.&amp;nbsp;
Additional inputs for consideration could be, but are not limited to,
current probe monitoring of the battery string, gas\/smoke sensor
signals, and outputs to control contactors, switches, relays, warning
lights, etc.&amp;nbsp; Proposed concepts must be adaptable and applied
in a simple and straightforward manner such that any number of end-users
 can utilize the system with minimal learning curve.&amp;nbsp; In
addition, proposers should be mindful of the goal of a flexible design
to allow for application on future battery designs and naval
applications with interface, input-output and processing capability
while allowing for enable local monitoring and control as well as
connectivity and communications with the various shipboard controls and
reporting systems.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Upon completion of Phase II
proposed concepts should address the ability to pass Navy standard
electrical safety device certification tests (in accordance with ref. 1
&amp;amp; 2, NAVSEAINST9310, S9310-AQ-SAF-010 Section 2.3.7.2.5, and

temperature, etc.).&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Demonstrate the feasibility of the
 innovative approaches to the development of a Battery Management System

effectiveness of the solution with modeling and simulation and

 Phase II developmental approach and schedule that contains discrete
milestones for product development.PHASE II: Develop, fabricate and
demonstrate a prototype as identified in Phase I.&amp;nbsp; In a
laboratory environment, demonstrate that the prototype meets the
performance goals established in Phase I.&amp;nbsp; Conduct performance
integration and risk assessments. Develop a cost benefit analysis and
cost estimate for a naval shipboard unit.&amp;nbsp; Provide a Phase III
installation, testing and validation plan.PHASE III: Working with the
Navy and applicable Industry partners, demonstrate application with an
energy storage module to be implemented within shipboard and\/or
land-based test site to support fuel saving or other
applications.&amp;nbsp; This initial testing will then support
transition into numerous energy storage applications. This effort will
provide detail drawings and specifications, including documentation for
manipulation of management operations and detailed explanation of the
operation of the device software.&amp;nbsp; The Proposer will perform
Electrical Safety Device evaluation in accordance with reference 2 for
the module as defined.PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE

AND ATTACK SUBMARINES AND NEW CONSTRUCTION.OBJECTIVE: To develop a
sealant, equivalent to the existing PR-944F polysulfide material, to
fill and fair-in the fastener head and cavities on submarine exterior
hulls in order to level the surface and protect the fasteners from
seawater.&amp;nbsp; The sealant must be significantly easier to remove
than PR-944F without increasing installation and cure times.DESCRIPTION:
 Countersunk fastener hole cavities (up to 5\u201d diameter and up to
3\u201d thick) on submarine exterior hulls are filled and faired with
PR-944F polysulfide sealant to level the surface and protect fasteners
from seawater.&amp;nbsp; In order to remove the fasteners the
polysulfide sealant, PR-944F, must first be removed. The removal of this
 sealant is very labor intensive and requires hand tools.&amp;nbsp; For
example, ship yards estimate that to remove the PR-944F polysulfide from
 submarine hulls takes 1251 man hours of labor to remove all PR-944F
seam filler during a typical&amp;nbsp; major availability.An equivalent,
 alternate sealant that is easier to remove is sought to reduce the time
 and labor currently required for maintenance, thus reducing costs to
the navy.&amp;nbsp; The sealant must exhibit hydrolytic stability when
immersed in seawater and exposed to pressure cycling; must be
environmentally friendly; safe for workers to use; have no adverse
impacts on fastener materials, epoxy paint, rubber, urethane, metallic
and Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) substrates; and provide adequate
adhesion to fastener materials, metallic\/nonmetallic substrates, paint
systems and hull coatings to remain affixed while at sea.&amp;nbsp; It
must exclude water under pressure from the surfaces it adheres to and
have minimal compression\/set under pressure.&amp;nbsp; The application
method must be feasible from a vertical, horizontal, or overhead
location with minimal sags, runs, or drips without increasing
installation and cure times beyond those currently existing for the
PR-944F.&amp;nbsp; Installation, storage, shipping environments and
requirements must be no more stringent than those currently required for
 PR-944F. Sealant packaging costs and shelf life shall be equivalent or
superior to those for the current system.PHASE I: Develop and define a
concept to identify an environmentally friendly, safe sealant that is
easier to remove than the current PR-944F.&amp;nbsp; Define concepts to
show its capability to replace PR-944F on submarine hulls with
equivalent capability to exclude water under pressure from the surfaces
to which it is applied. Concepts must include test methodologies for
measuring hydrolytic stability when immersed in seawater and exposed to
pressure cycling with minimal compression\/set. Conceptual materials
must &amp;nbsp;have no adverse impacts on fastener materials, epoxy
paint, rubber, urethane, metallic and Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP)
substrates, and provide adequate adhesion to fastener materials,
metallic\/nonmetallic substrates, paint systems and hull coatings to
remain affixed in an at-sea environment.PHASE II.&amp;nbsp; Demonstrate
and validate the sealant identified from Phase I to replace PR-944F on
representative submarine hull section or mock-up that incorporates the
desired typical features of interest. This includes countersunk fastener
 hole cavities up to 5\u201d diameter and up to 3\u201d thick. Evaluate
the sealant from Phase I to validate that it can be prepared and
installed without increasing installation and cure times beyond those
required by PR-944F. Verify installation environment requirements. The
application method must be demonstrated to be feasible from a vertical,
horizontal, or overhead location with minimal sags, runs, or drips.
Ensure cured sealant does not shrink causing separation from edges or
exposing substrate.Removal methods shall be identified and employed to
evaluate the ease of removal for the sealant. During removal of the
selected material, it shall be demonstrated that there is no adverse
impact on fastener materials, surrounding paint and hull coatings, as
well as substrates.The environmental requirements for material
installation, storage and shipping will be determined and must be no
more stringent than those currently required for PR-944F.&amp;nbsp; MSDS
 and material data sheets for the material shall be generated and
supplied.&amp;nbsp; The required sealant kit packaging costs shall be
determined and must be no more than the existing material
costs.&amp;nbsp; Determine and evaluate any receipt inspection and
quality assurance testing necessary for the sealant from Phase I
including periodicity and test procedures.PHASE III: Evaluate and
validate the sealant to ensure that it meets the prescribed properties
through testing a representative fabricated submarine hull section with
fastener cavities.&amp;nbsp; A representative fabricated hull section
should also be tested to evaluate the ease of removal of the sealant.
The application method must be demonstrated to be feasible from a
vertical, horizontal, or overhead location with minimal sags, runs, or
drips, and the sealant must also be verified to be environmentally
friendly and safe.&amp;nbsp; Evaluate the sealant from Phase II to
validate that it can be installed without increasing installation and
cure times beyond those required by PR-944F.&amp;nbsp; Verify
installation environment requirements.The environments and requirements
for material installation, storage and shipping will be determined and
must be no more stringent than those currently required for PR-944F
Material Safety.&amp;nbsp; Data Sheets for the material shall be
generated and supplied.&amp;nbsp; The required sealant kit packaging
costs shall be determined and must be no more than the existing material
 costs.&amp;nbsp; The shelf life for the sealant from Phase II shall be
determined and shall be no less than 1-year (preference for over 2
years).&amp;nbsp; Determine and evaluate any receipt inspection and
quality assurance testing necessary for the sealant from Phase II

this task would be to research, develop, and demonstrate a strain gage
(sensor) capable of measuring axisymmetric hoop strain of a large
diameter shell. The sensor must be accurate over a broad frequency
range, down to and including zero Hz.DESCRIPTION: Large structures acted
 upon by external forces exhibit complex vibrations. A complex vibration
 pattern consists of a superposition of many simpler vibration patterns
(modes), each of which has a characteristic wavelength. Often the impact
 on the overall health of a structure depends more heavily on the
vibration of modes with long wavelengths. For cylindrical shells, hoop
strain is a key indicator of structural health. The current method of
estimating the hoop strain is to place a large number of point sensors
(accelerometers) around the circumference of the structure and apply
geometrical weighting to the sensor signals. Many sensors are needed to
filter out the shorter wavelength vibration content that can dominate
the signals of the individual sensors. Each point sensor requires a
cable to provide electric power and to transmit the measured signal to a
 centralized signal processing unit. Thus, to extract the single measure
 of axisymmetric hoop strain can require a significant amount of
hardware and signal processing.This proposal is looking for an
innovative and cost reducing method that can measure the required strain
 over a long line or large area.&amp;nbsp; Such a sensor must operate
with minimal signal processing and low electrical power. It must operate
 over a range of environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, noise,
 and vibration). It must be capable of installation, operation, and
maintenance by trained personnel. It should provide a significant
signal-to-noise (SNR) improvement over current technology.&amp;nbsp;
Such a technology could intrinsically eliminate the need for spatial
filtering, thereby radically reducing the signal processing and cabling
demands and greatly reducing installation, operational, and servicing
cost.PHASE I: Develop concepts for a field of distributed sensor
technology and propose a candidate set of technologies to test and
evaluate in Phase II. The contractor will develop distributed hoop
strain sensor concepts to address the requirements mentioned
above.&amp;nbsp; Criteria for assessing the technology will include
accuracy, latency, linearity, ease of calibration, durability,
fragility, electrical power\/voltage\/current requirements, and
electro-magnetic interference.PHASE II: The contractor will expand upon
the Phase I work to develop a representative prototype of selected
sensor concepts.&amp;nbsp; The prototypes will then be demonstrated and
tested under a number of operating conditions (temperature, humidity,
noise and vibration level) that the government will specify.PHASE III:
The contractor will support the government in field testing the
distributed strain sensor. The contractor will acquire the capability to
 manufacture the distributed strain sensor and the capability to provide
 technical support to the government in installation, operation, and
maintenance of the strain sensors.PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL

 If a proposal for this topic contains participation by a foreign
citizen who is not in one of the above two categories, the proposal will
 be rejected.OBJECTIVE: Develop an advanced, modular, scalable,
converter charger for a 250 kilo-joule (KJ) capacitor for the
Electromagnetic Railgun's (EMRG's) Pulsed Power System
(PPS).DESCRIPTION: The Navy is currently developing a Pulsed Power
System (PPS) to power an Electromagnetic Railgun (EMRG). The PPS uses a
capacitor bank as the source of the very high current (on the order of
several mega-amps) required by the EMRG for operation. EMRG requirements
 necessitate the use of a high power density (&amp;gt;1MW\/m3) DC\/DC
converter capable of high, repetition-rate charging of capacitor banks.
This capacitor bank is comprised of 250 KJ capacitor
\u201crep-rate\u201d modules which must recharge from the ship\u2019s
power system in no more than several seconds (equating to an average
power draw of greater than 40 KW per module, or a total of greater than 8
 MW for a 50 MJ system) in order to achieve the desired EMRG repetition
rate. Presently, the available state-of-the-art in commercial capacitor
chargers is not optimal for the anticipated high repetition-rate EMRG
application. They have insufficient power ratings, with a unit size of
less than 35KW, which would require that a very large number of systems
be operated in parallel. They have power density of &amp;lt;0.2MW\/m3 as
 single units which becomes significantly worse as units are ganged
together in cabinets. They are not configured for the projected DC
voltage input that they will see in this application and would require
external rectifiers, further reducing power density. They are not
suitable for shipboard use and would need significant modifications to
meet military standards for shock, vibration, EMI, and power quality.
Lastly, the volume and interior space air conditioning limits of
shipboard application dictate the use of liquid cooling. Commercial
chargers are nearly exclusively air cooled, which imposes a significant
volume penalty and results in heat being dissipated into the interior
spaces of the ship, placing a large heat burden on the air conditioning
system. These shortcomings necessitate the development of a capacitor
charger capable of being used to meet the more robust requirements of
the EMRG pulsed power system.This topic seeks to explore innovative
approach(es) to the development of an advanced, modular, converter
charger for a 250 KJ capacitor. The proposed converter charger concept
must be able to: draw power from a 700-900 VDC battery bank; provide
sufficient power to charge the 250 KJ capacitor to 10 kVDC within
several seconds; have a repetition rate of 6 charges\/minute; have a
peak-to-average power ratio of no more than 1.3 over the charge cycle.
As necessary, the proposed concepts should incorporate liquid cooling
and other technologies (such as but not limited to: advanced power
electronic devices, novel topologies, etc) for reducing the overall
system size (&amp;gt;1MW\/m^3). This system should be designed so that
the devices and topologies employed will be scalable during the Phase
III to the voltage and power levels (10kV and 8MW) needed for a 50+ MJ
capacitor bank with 1 MJ capacitor converter chargers that can be
operated separately or ganged together without compromising volume.PHASE
 I: Demonstrate the feasibility of an advanced, scalable, modular
converter charger for a 250 KJ capacitor.&amp;nbsp; As applicable,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution with modeling and
simulation and engineering analysis.&amp;nbsp; Establish performance
goals and provide a Phase II developmental approach and schedule that
contains discrete milestones for product development.PHASE II: Develop,
demonstrate and fabricate a prototype as identified in Phase
I.&amp;nbsp; In a laboratory environment, demonstrate that the prototype
 meets the performance goals established in Phase I.&amp;nbsp; Conduct
performance, integration, and risk assessments. Develop a cost benefit
analysis and cost estimate for a naval shipboard unit.&amp;nbsp; Provide
 a Phase III installation, testing, and validation plan.&amp;nbsp;
Proposer should demonstrate that the proposed components and concepts
would be scaleable up to full voltage and power levels of 50 MJ.PHASE
III: Working with the Navy and Industry, as applicable, design and
construct a fully functional 250 KJ charger converter capable of being
scaled to 1 MJ for future use in a 50+ MJ capacitor bank.&amp;nbsp; The
goal is to be able to utilize the proposed converter charger concept on
the EMRG proof-of-concept demonstration and design efforts and,
ultimately, in a system onboard a ship.PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL

 are applicable utility and industrial applications requiring high
density dc power conversion, especially those involving the charging of
large banks of capacitors. Examples include fusion research facilities
such as the National Ignition Facility (NIF) which use 100\u2019s of
megajoules of stored energy. Technologies would also be applicable to
more general medium voltage power electronics applications such as
High-Voltage DC transmission (HVDC) systems, medium-voltage motor
drives, and systems designed to interface alternative energy supplies to
 the medium voltage distribution grid.&amp;nbsp;",

Power Environments",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Information Systems,
SensorsOBJECTIVE: Identify and develop potential new Public Key
Algorithms (PKAs) that can be implemented in low size, weight and power
(SWAP) environments. Demonstrate their efficacy in providing low latency
 communications in dynamically configurable networks. Quantify
performance of proposed algorithms with respect to figures of interest
such as network size, desired throughput, etc.DESCRIPTION: The reliance
on networks of all kinds is pervasive throughout the Department of
Defense (DoD). Of particular and growing importance is the use of
networks of distributed, low size, weight and power (SWAP) sensors of
limited range that can, by acting cooperatively, provide widearea
capability. The informative power of this capability is often directly
dependent on the relative quality of communications, both intraand
internetwork, that are available to the constituent nodes. Consequently,
 communication capacity emerges as a vital component of the networked
system, and thus its integrity must be ensured. Encryption is typically
employed to ensure communication security, but many cryptographic
techniques rely on static configurations (e.g., the ability to ensure
secure key distribution) to achieve the desired level of protection.
Conversely, public key algorithms (PKAs) can be used in dynamic
settings.&amp;nbsp; However, standard implementations such as RSA or
those based on discretelogarithms are computationally intensive and have
 not been designed for use in low SWAP environments.DARPA is interested
in research and development into new classes of PKAs that are
particularly well suited for low SWAP network settings. Investigations
should include quantitative analysis of the relative strength of any
proposed algorithm, as well as characterization of its complexity (both
in space and time) and its scalability.PHASE I: Investigate and identify
 potential new PKAs. A detailed mathematical analysis of strengths and
weaknesses must be provided. Quantify computational complexity, both in
space and time, and determine scalability (in terms of network size) of
any proposed approach. While this analysis may be supported by
simulation, rigorous derivation of all claims is to be preferred. Phase I
 deliverables should also include a preliminary conceptual design of a
network of generic low SWAP sensors on which the proposed PKAs are
hosted.PHASE II: Further develop, demonstrate and validate the efficacy
of the PKAs proposed in Phase I. Early proof-of-concept demonstrations
should take the form of software simulations that verify the complexity
and scalability claims derived earlier in the effort. Later phase effort
 should be directed toward the construction of a hardware based
demonstration comprising networks of low SWAP nodes. For both
demonstrations, developers will be responsible for formulating
meaningful performance metrics, and constructing a relevant test plan
based on these. In addition, it is highly desirable that late phase
demonstrations are motivated by realworld applications, and resources
should be devoted to ensuring that proposed architectures align with
current and future DoD relevant scenarios.PHASE III: In the commercial
realm, this work has the potential for use in mobile ad hoc networks
(MANETs), and hence will be of interest to a wide range of
telecommunications providers. Because of prevalence of networks and
networked sensors throughout the DoD, the research to be undertaken in
this effort is of potential value in many military applications. One
potential customer is USMC, which makes use of distributed sensors in
providing force protection to its expeditionary forces.",

Develop manufacturing approaches and sensor configurations for short
wave infrared (SWIR) focal plane arrays (FPAs) that significantly reduce
 the cost of SWIR FPA packaging, optics and integration into
micro-systems.DESCRIPTION: SWIR imaging technology has significant
advantages over conventional low light level imaging approaches,
providing increased sensitivity and capturing unique target
characteristics associated with the SWIR spectral band. SWIR FPAs are
sensitive from the visible to short wave infrared with spectral band
cutoff at 1.7um, where there is a large ambient signal level due to
\u201cnight glow.\u201d&amp;nbsp; In addition to sensitivity advantages,
 SWIR imaging adds the capability for covert illumination outside the
spectral range of conventional low light level devices; the capability
to detect hidden and camouflaged targets; and sensitivity to battlefield
 lasers and target designators.Widespread military application of these
significant system performance advantages requires high quality SWIR
FPAs affordable for general use in military systems. Recent improvements
 in SWIR detector and FPA technology have led to sensors with
considerable system advantages. The dark current of shortwave sensitive
material, indium gallium arsenide, has been substantially reduced,
enhancing the signal-to-noise and increasing the operating temperature,
ultimately with the potential for room temperature operation. Likewise,
the noise of the readout integrated circuit has been reduced without
sacrifice of dynamic range.Transition of these substantial performance
improvements into affordable systems will establish digital low light
level imaging for military systems. Successful transition of SWIR FPAs
can be facilitated by a substantial reduction in the cost of SWIR
imaging sensors. New sensor configurations and innovative system designs
 are needed to capitalize on the recent advances in material and device
technology and establish an affordable SWIR camera technology. In
current manufacturing approaches, SWIR FPAs are individual packaged and
integrated with optics. A wafer scale approach for die packaging and
optics integration would significantly reduce sensor cost. New sensor
concepts are also needed to achieve large format arrays, providing large
 field of view, with high resolution focused on critical areas of
interest in the scene. These design innovations and low cost
manufacturing approaches could also lead to micro-cameras with
significant reduction in camera size and open new applications in helmet
 mounted systems and sensors for micro-air and ground vehicles.PHASE
I:&amp;nbsp; Investigate packaging and optics integration for short wave
 infrared focal plane arrays to include assessment of materials and
manufacturing approaches amendable to the manufacture of wafer level
camera; Determine optimum array format and pixel size for imaging at a
target identification range of 100 to 1,000 meters with minimum of
horizontal field of view of forty (40) degrees; Assess the potential to
produce a large format SWIR imager with size less than 20 cm3. Perform
thermal, mechanical, optical analysis of encapsulation and optical
materials to assess compatibility with SWIR FPA manufacturing.PHASE
II:&amp;nbsp; Demonstrate with a small format SWIR array the design
developed in Phase I, leading toward a wide field of view SWIR camera.
The design shall demonstrate the potential for 10X cost reduction
relative to current camera cost, and the potential for the overall
volume reduction.PHASE III: SWIR cameras currently have military and
commercial applications, both benefiting from the cost and size
reduction associated with wafer level focal plane arrays. Commercial
applications include homeland security, industrial process control, and
biomedical applications. Military applications are focused on night
imaging for a wide range of areas, including both man-portable systems
and micro air and ground vehicles. The contractor shall fabricate the
wide field o f view SWIR camera and show volume and size reduction
relative to state of the art SWIR cameras. The camera shall demonstrate
imaging over a minimum forty (40) degree horizontal field of view with

chip silicon based circuit forming the receiver of a MMW sparse array
radiometer with an output suitable for photonic
processing.DESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; Passive millimeter wave technology has
 been investigated for over five decades as a sensing modality with
unique properties that may prove useful for military and commercial
applications. Recent applications have ranged from screening personnel
for contraband at military checkpoints and commercial distribution
centers to providing video rate imaging for combat helicopters to land
in degraded visual conditions such as dust, snow, and fog. Work from the
 90\u2019s up to the current time has been ongoing to demonstrate the
utility of using photonics for processing the down converted (not
detected) output from MMW receivers in such a manner that video cameras
are used to transform images into video data streams [1]. A challenge to
 practically realizing such a system has been the inability to achieve
sufficient sensitivity with purely photonic receivers and maintain
inter-channel balance and single receiver stability in an affordable
manner [2]. With recent advances in SiGe RF circuits [3], we may have
reached a point where all of these issues can be addressed in a single
silicon based circuit.PHASE I:&amp;nbsp; Design the architecture of a
single chip silicon based circuit forming the receiver of a MMW sparse
array radiometer with an output suitable for photonic processing.
Establish the potential processes ensuring the receiver is stable and

silicon based circuit and demonstrate capability to operate with a
photonics image processor. Sufficiently demonstrate the stability of the
 circuit, the variations in performance from chip to chip, and the
ability to interface the chip to a photonics processor. Include antennas
 required for matching the circuit to the scene to be imaged.PHASE
III:&amp;nbsp; Under Phase III it is expected that the performer will
transition the design of the circuit developed into a system suitable
for use in pilotage and navigation under degraded visual environments or

WeaponsOBJECTIVE: Identify and develop advanced, high efficiency
propellants and\/or divert actuator and attitude control systems
exhibiting highly controllable and steady burn properties for
endo-atmospheric and exo-atmospheric use.&amp;nbsp; The system shall be
operational at ambient temperatures from -60 deg F to 170 deg
F.&amp;nbsp; Fast reaction times for the propellant systems are desired
with a goal of less than 10 ms.&amp;nbsp; The goal is also to produce a
green propellant that meets insensitive munitions
requirements.&amp;nbsp; Novel concepts for propellant systems that have a
 high system mass fraction (greater than 40%) and a high delta velocity
(greater than 1000 m\/s) are desired.DESCRIPTION: Current US Navy
missile systems can be made more capable with controllable, high
efficiency divert actuator control systems and attitude control systems
with innovative designs and novel propellants.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Unsteady burn properties can result in high rates of jitter or
vibrational noise, which can affect missile performance in target
acquisition, track, and the required precision in missile
orientation.&amp;nbsp; Future missile systems will probably require the
kill vehicle to travel longer distances and achieve higher divert
margins than their predecessors. To achieve future requirements the
divert actuator control systems and the attitude control systems will
require more efficient designs and higher energy density.&amp;nbsp;
Systems that can regulate the burn rate to conserve fuel are of
interest.&amp;nbsp; Increased efficiency may reduce kill vehicle weight
which would allow move velocity from the main propulsion system to
achieve faster target intercepts and improve the opportunities to engage
 the target.&amp;nbsp; Increased fuel efficiency is also desired to
achieve the longer range, larger divert requirements as well as maintain
 or reduce the current weight and\/or volume of propellant used within
the missile. In addition, US Navy missile requirements aim to use
propellant materials and missile designs that facilitate the release of
explosive energy without violent reaction or fratricide of adjacent
munitions. This requirement has significantly limited the implementation
 of proposed hypergolic liquid propellant designs. Hypergolic liquid
propellants\u2019 inherent toxicity is a cause of concern for current US
 Navy missile applications.This topic is soliciting innovative
propellant materials of any state (solid, liquid or other) and system
designs for innovative divert actuator control systems and attitude
control systems, and includes evaluating thrust diverter actuator
systems for new and innovative methods to achieve a higher level of

predictability.PHASE I: Develop a concept for an innovative propellant

above.&amp;nbsp; In addition, create a plan of approach, or roadmap, to
develop, test and demonstrate the proposed technology.&amp;nbsp; Phase I
 deliverables will include a technical report and brief describing the
technical feasibility and merit of the use of advanced propellants

 feasibility in a missile environment. In addition, deliverables will

advanced propellants and the propellant system design approach and the
feasibility of use in future Navy missile programs.PHASE III: Finalize
the design and manufacture of high efficiency propellants and propellant
 actuator systems exhibiting highly controllable and steady burn
properties while facilitating the release of explosive energy without
violent reaction. Possible applications may include, but are not limited

develop techniques and methods for enhancing software robustness and

 information dominance requires Department of Defense (DoD) to maintain
trust, availability and security within its information infrastructures.
 COTS based hardware and software in our computing systems and the
network are large, complex and hence inherently insecure. Currently
flaws in software are the major contributor to the vulnerability of
cyber systems.&amp;nbsp; Most if not all of these vulnerabilities
originate from improper software implementations.&amp;nbsp; Identified
flaws that lead to improper implementations include, and are not limited
 to; buffer overflow, stack and heap overflow, dangling pointers, input
data format violation, race conditions and deadlocks, etc.&amp;nbsp;
Significant investment has been made to address this issue through
techniques that seek to provide formal or other forms of software
verification. However, complementary efforts to verification, an
automated method to enhance programmers awareness of his\/her work
during software development is under-explored.Only rarely are all of the
 details for the implementation of software be specified in
advance.&amp;nbsp; Currently, programmers make instantaneous detailed
design decisions during software coding. These instantaneous decisions
(and assumptions) have far reaching effects, and they are often
forgotten and lost. A tool that captures and documents these design
decisions (and hence assumptions) automatically as coding is in progress
 can significantly enhance maintainability, robustness, and security of
codes. The availability of these tools also presents an opportunity to
provide feedback to programmers to improve the correctness of their
product and enhance productivity and efficiency.&amp;nbsp;The objective

 to develop a working prototype of a software development tool which
performs automatic capture and document programmer's design decisions
(ACD3), as coding is in progress. This software development tool should
be applicable to one or more widely used programming languages, within
common software development frameworks. The development of this tool may
 employ one or more of the following (partial) list of methods: capture
and visualization of program structure and data, variable, and
subroutine dependencies, capture of programmer's intent, analysis and
prediction of consequences, formal analysis, etc. This solicitation does
 not entertain methods and tools specifically targeted for software
verification.PHASE I:&amp;nbsp; Architectural analysis and design for
the automated capture &amp;amp; documentation of design decision (ACD3)
tool for an open-source software development environment of choice.
Develop a proof of concept prototype for ACD3.&amp;nbsp; Identify the
metrics that determine the prototype\u2019s value-added.PHASE
II:&amp;nbsp; Develop a full functioning prototype of a tool which
performs automated capture &amp;amp; documentation of design decision
(ACD3) for an open-source software development environment of choice.
Demonstrate the efficacy for the tool.PHASE III Dual Use
Application:&amp;nbsp; ACD3 is a valuable tool for both the DoD as well
as for software developing public. It should find its role in, and can
be ported into, various open-source and proprietary software development
 environments. ACD3 should also be applicable and portable to
development environments of many different programming languages for
many different application spaces, such as high performance computing,
mobile devices, embedded systems, finance applications, cloud computing,
 the web and service oriented applications, etc.",

        "topic_name": "Adaptive, individualized training assessment
capability (AITAC)",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Information Systems, Human
SystemsOBJECTIVE:&amp;nbsp; The objective of this topic is to develop
and implement a technique for building individualized representations of
 trainee performance that can be used to assess current performance and
to forecast future training needs.DESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; Increasingly,
instructional system developers are focusing their efforts on developing
 individualizable and adaptable training capabilities [1].&amp;nbsp; The
 benefits of providing this type of instruction are well documented [2]
and are a direct result of the fact that&amp;nbsp; individuals learn in
different ways [3]. At the core of any adaptive training system are
representations of the trainee, in terms of their knowledge, skills and
abilities [4]. These representations are used by the instructional
system to assess current trainee performance and to forecast the timing
and content of future instructional remediations.&amp;nbsp; A key
challenge with building truly individualizable and adaptable training
systems rests in the manner in which these trainee representations are
developed. Typically, these representations are created using
pre-defined performance measures, bounded by static parameters. Once a
boundary is passed, a standard intervention is applied until the next
iteration of performance assessment shows a return to within-parameter
conditions.The challenges with this approach are threefold. First, the
set of performance measures used in a training system is often based on
speed and accuracy characteristics. This approach precludes adding
individual trainee-and training domain - unique measures, leading to a
significant reduction in individualizability and adaptability. Second,
the selected set of performance measures relies on establishing
predefined thresholds to establish \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018poor\u2019
 performance. This approach removes much of the richness and complexity
of individual trainee performance, leading to inadequate timing,
presentation and selection of training remediation. Lastly, because
training systems base their anticipated training remediations on these
static, average measurements, their future predictions of when trainees
will need remediation, and what the content of that remediation should
be, are inaccurate.The current topic seeks to address these three
challenges by developing and implementing a technique for building
individualized representations of trainee performance that can be used
to assess current performance and to forecast future training needs. The
 desired approach includes three elements. The first element includes
developing a performance ontology that will: represent domain knowledge,
 reason about the elements and relations of that domain, support
evaluation of performance and interpretation of data and provide scoring
 models and criteria for performance \u2013 to include cognitive,
behavioral and physiological data [5]. The second element includes
linking the resultant ontology to artificial intelligence or machine
learning techniques to: dynamically make inferences and predictions
about performance; and to handle uncertainty arising from latent
variables or missing data [5]. The last element requires demonstrating
the effectiveness of this capability to both accurately assess current
trainee performance and to forecast future remediation
requirements.PHASE I:&amp;nbsp; Define requirements for developing and
implementing a technique for building individualized representations of
trainee performance that can be used to assess current performance and
to forecast future training needs. Requirements definition must include:
 a description of the overall ontology structure, the artificial
intelligence technique that will be used and how the two will integrate;
 a determination of the types and characteristics of metrics that will
be captured and used; a detailed discussion of the specific domain to be
 represented; and; and, a discussion of analysis and assessment
techniques to be used. Phase II plans should also be provided, to
include key component technological milestones and plans for testing and
 validation of the proposed system and its components. Phase I should
also include the processing and submission of any necessary human
subjects use protocols.PHASE II:&amp;nbsp; Develop a prototype system
based on the preliminary design from Phase I.&amp;nbsp; All appropriate
engineering testing will be performed, and a critical design review will
 be performed to finalize the design. Phase II deliverables will
include: (1.) a working prototype of the system, (2) specification for
its development, and (3) demonstration and validation of ability to both
 accurately assess current trainee performance and to forecast future
remediation requirements.PHASE III:&amp;nbsp; This technology will have
broad application in military as well as commercial settings.Within the
military, there is increasing emphasis on the ability to develop
training systems that tailor their instruction to individual trainee
needs. Developing these \u2018cognitive tutors\u2019 is costly. Tools
that will make building these systems more cost effective, as well as
make the training more effective are needed. The proposed effort will
enable the delivery of more effective training and will support
knowledge sharing and reuse, leading to reduced up-front development
costs. Commercially, the last several years has witnessed a resurgence
in interest in developing individualized \u2018digital tutor\u2019 types
 of training systems for classroom (grades K-12) use (e.g. President
Obama\u2019s 2011 State of the Union address), in support of Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education. The much wider
 range of learner characteristics of the K-12 student population can
only be addressed by the types of technologies developed under this
effort. Lastly, training in the commercial labor market is a
multi-billion dollar business. Technologies that facilitate the
application of adaptive training tools to a wide range of domains will
lead to reduced cost and enhanced trainee learning experiences.",

 Based on Contextual Factors",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Information Systems, Human
SystemsOBJECTIVE: Develop an adaptive desktop training device with
underlying learning management system (LMS) architecture to train ISR
imagery analysis for better decision making by warfighters.DESCRIPTION:
ISR imagery data has become paramount to military success in current
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. As more and more ISR platforms are
being pushed into the operational environment it is becoming
increasingly important to provide training that educates users on what
they should expect to see from this imagery in the context that these
assets will be deployed. Cultural, environmental, behavioral, economic,
religious, and other factors play a significant role in the types of
imagery users will observe in the AOR. Being aware of the context within
 a particular situation provides necessary information to determine if a
 potential target is for example: just filling in a hole as part of
his\/her job or covering up an IED. Additionally, understanding current
and evolving tactics of insurgent operations are also an important
factor in recognizing what is truly happening or about to happen in a
situation and can mean the difference between life or death of troops
and innocent civilians. A desktop training system is needed to train
these users (Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS) imagery analysts,
Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) crew members, ground troops who utilize
ROVER feeds, etc) on how to interpret the actions they are seeing on the
 ground in order understand the significance of what is occurring and
make better decisions about what actions to take. This system should
provide an individually adaptive imagery training capability based on an
 underlying LMS architecture to bring users to a high degree of skill
level to recognize events and situations on the ground using simulated
Electro-Optical, Infrared, and Full Motion Video imagery. Furthermore,
this system should have the ability to ingest new insurgent TTP
information and other important factors (cultural, environmental,
behavioral, economic, religious, etc) to adapt intelligent agent models
and scenarios presented to users so that training can remain up-to-date
with current operations. Finally, this system, though first developed as
 a standalone desktop environment, should have the capability for
expansions into more complex operational simulation environments.PHASE
I: This phase will identify content for the development effort based on
an assessment of operational needs. In addition, Phase I will develop a
proof-of-concept desktop exemplar of the training and rehearsal concept
to be fully developed in the Phase II effort.PHASE II: Will build upon
Phase I to fully develop, refine, test and evaluate the components of
the system to include the underlying LMS, adaptive training course
content, intelligent agent technologies and modular design for
integration with an operational simulation environment. The final
prototype will demonstrate these capabilities as well as the ability to
ingest new or update material.PHASE III DUAL-USE
COMMERCIALIZATION:Military Application: Imagery data for ISR is a major
component of operations across all services. The developed technology
would be beneficial for imagery analysts and warfighters who utilize
IMINT sensors in DCGS, RPA, and ground operations.Commercial
Application: This training system would provide a beneficial tool for US
 Customs and Border Protection, homeland security, and natural disaster
relief personnel who perform analysis on imagery data for decision
making.",

SystemsOBJECTIVE: The objective of this effort is to research, develop
and implement prototype capabilities to simulate the communication and
coordination of an operational Intelligence Surveillance and
Reconnaissance environment for the purpose of providing: (a) Realistic
RPA crew mission task saturation; (b) enhanced integration and
coordination across an operational testbed environment; (c) a system to
prototype, integrate and evaluate intelligent agents and synthetic
teammates from both government and commercial sources at various levels
of fidelity.DESCRIPTION: In August 2010 operational Remotely Piloted
Aircraft (RPA) crews visited AFRL Mesa to attend a training
effectiveness workshop. During the workshop operators were asked for
ideas to improve training. The consistent answer was to provide a
capability for the RPA operators to interact and coordinate with other
members of the ISR community (e.g. Mission Intelligence Coordinators) as
 they do in real world operations. Again in September 2010 during a
follow up meeting with additional RPA crews, the same question was posed
 and the same answer was given. A system is needed that will create
realistic task saturation in a simulated environment for ISR
communication and coordination for improved training effectiveness for
RPA operations and other command and control assets. This system should
employ synthetic and intelligent agent technology to provide
operationally realistic communication and coordination in the midst of a
 scenario but also have the capability to monitor individual performance
 and adapt the level of saturation to provide the appropriate level
based on individual operator capabilities, essentially adaptive training
 for personalized learning. Additionally, the system should be designed
to utilize existing operational community text based communication
mediums (e.g. mIRC chat) to communicate. The modeled entities should be
constructed synthetically and formatted so that both government and COTS
 systems may be used in parallel. The level of fidelity can
interchangeably range from basic scripting to advanced intelligent
architecture. The system should be capable of supporting multiple
simulators for command and control training within an operational
testbed.PHASE I: Will research the operational needs, and result in the
development of the initial underlying software architecture for this
system and demonstrate its capabilities in a proof of concept to show
functionality of each component of the total system.PHASE II: Will fully
 develop the prototype software technology and underlying architecture
and demonstrate the capability to provide task saturation and adapt the
levels of saturation in an operational testbed in three different
scenarios.PHASE III DUAL-USE COMMERCIALIZATION:Military Application: The
 military is increasingly relying more and more on chat communication
for C2 operations. The development of this system would provide a
capability that would apply to several domains and provide a new
capability to improve operator ability to handle task saturation through
 personalized and adaptive training.Commercial Application: This
capability provides an adaptive training technology for task saturation
for chat based communications in civilian contexts.",

Learning Content Management System",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Human
SystemsOBJECTIVE:&amp;nbsp; Develop or modify existing Learning
Management Systems (LMS) and Learning Content Management Systems (LCMS)
to be able to use a Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) like process to
adapt to a pre-established knowledge\/skill baseline to dynamically
alter SCORM, DIS, or HLA training content deliveryDESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp;
 Current military training is often linear and
non-discriminatory.&amp;nbsp; That is regardless of an individual\u2019s
 base knowledge and skills the training content remains the
same.&amp;nbsp; This is especially true for DoD Computer Learning
Content Information Management Systems (CLCIMS).&amp;nbsp; In order to
be effective in these times of high ops tempo with less and less
opportunities for training, we need a training solution that is adaptive
 to an individual\u2019s needs and can customize training to better
prepare them for their mission and career.&amp;nbsp; For this training
solution to be a success at least four different components are required
 to interact with each another.&amp;nbsp; 1) Develop or modify existing
Learning Management Systems (LMS) to allow easy incorporation of ever
changing essential competencies, skills, knowledge, and experience such
as those defined in Air Force Mission Essential Tasks Lists (METLs),
Training Task Lists (TTLs) or the Mission Essential Competencies (MEC)
analysis to establish baseline skills and knowledge required for an
individual to be successful in their mission\/career rather than just
training modules.&amp;nbsp; 2) Develop a way to capture performance
during training content delivery and mapping them to the establish
baseline in the LMS.&amp;nbsp; 3) Develop or modify existing Learning
Content Management Systems (LCMS) to be SCORM, DIS, and HLA
compliant.&amp;nbsp; 4) Incorporate a Computerized Adaptive Testing
(CAT) like process into the Learning Content Management
System.&amp;nbsp; Fully integrated we expect the LMS to track an
individual\u2019s performance mapped to an established baseline while
the LCMS then dynamically adapt training scenarios\/content based on the
 information stored in the LCMS.&amp;nbsp; Additionally having the LCMS
SCORM, DIS, and HLA compliant, content delivery can be in the form of
Computer Based Training (CBT) or through a variety of Modeling and
Simulation tools that utilizes DIS\/HLA protocols depending on what
training content\/scenario is delivered.&amp;nbsp; This allows training
scenario\/content to better fit the type of delivery to an appropriate
learning environment.&amp;nbsp; For the scope of this effort the
targeted training audience will be the Senior Intelligence Duty Officer
(SIDO) and Intelligence Duty Officer (IDO) of the Air and Space
Operations Center (AOC).&amp;nbsp; Their primary duties are Command and
Control (C2) coordination as it relates to intelligence on the combat
ops floor.&amp;nbsp; However, the architecture in this training solution
 is ideally content-agnostic such that you can adapt the system for a
multitude of military and civilian application.PHASE I:&amp;nbsp; Define
 and document the framework to easily incorporate new data sets such as
knowledge, skills, and experiences into a LMS, identify how performance
during content delivery is tracked and mapped to the LMS, to develop or
modify existing LCMS to be SCORM, HLA, and DIS compliant, and define how
 to integrate a CAT like process into the LCMS.&amp;nbsp; This includes
identifying current LMS and LCMS and how they can be modified.&amp;nbsp;
 Or if it is determined that a new LMS\/LCMS is needed, define the
approach.PHASE II:&amp;nbsp; Fully develop a proof of concept prototype
to verify and demonstrate the four integrated component capabilities
using the SIDO and IDO as usage cases.&amp;nbsp; This includes the
ability to add new data sets into the LMS, the ability for the LCMS to
deliver SCORM, HLA, and DIS content, and the LCMS dynamically altering
training content delivery based on performance tracking mapped to the
baseline in the LMS.PHASE III DUAL-USE COMMERCIALIZATION:The proposed
training solution is applicable to a variety of military and civilian
applications.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The immediate usage case is directly
applicable to most individuals with C2 coordination as a primary duty on
 the military side such as those in Air Support Operations Centers
(ASOC), Tactical Operation Centers (TOCs), Maritime Operation Centers
(MOCs).&amp;nbsp; On the civilian side these will include personnel
assigned to homeland security or natural disaster relief C2
organizations at the county, state, or federal
level.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Additionally since the architecture is
ideally content-agnostic, it can be modified for the Human Resources
domain, education domain, etc.",

        "topic_name": "Contextual Sociocultural Reasoning in Weak Signal
 Environments",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Information Systems, Human
SystemsOBJECTIVE: Develop a method and implement a technique to
correlate a variety of sociocultural, environmental, and geospatial data
 gathered from a region of interest to perform correlations and forecast
 likely future impacts of observations.DESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; Irregular
warfare, non-state terrorism movements, and uncertain environmental
patterns that trigger major weather disasters are producing a reality
for military and government leaders where traditional physics-based
sensors alone are insufficient to plan current and future actions in a
region on interest or need.&amp;nbsp; Context awareness is a critical
requirement for decision makers because it provides important
information about situations and dynamics relevant to goals, functions,
and data needs [1].&amp;nbsp; Strategies for achieving contextual
understanding can include observational data, a priori knowledge models,
 and inductive knowledge [2].&amp;nbsp; Contextual understanding is
generally achieved through a combination of human and computer
processing techniques that take advantage of a person\u2019s cognitive
ability to fuse and assimilate multiple sources and types of information
 for new insights [3].&amp;nbsp; In the domains identified earlier in
this topic, it is critical to incorporate both hard and soft data to
gain an understanding of the delicate balance between individuals and
groups in society and the environments (geopolitical, social,
agricultural, etc.) upon which they depend.&amp;nbsp; Test and
evaluation of methods that fuse hard and soft data are challenging due
to the nature of the data, the test environment, and the metrics for
determining outcomes [4].&amp;nbsp; Unlike traditional military test and
 evaluation, however, data sources for this new type of problem are not
classified or difficult to obtain; open source data is available and
plentiful but it is collected by a diverse group of
researchers.&amp;nbsp; The challenge becomes correlating data of many
different types that represent various aspects of a region of
interest.&amp;nbsp; This approach is similar to the signal processing
approach of weak signal detection, that is used to extract received
signals [5], identify images in noisy backgrounds [6], and conduct
remote sensing of land and water resources for sustainable development
of natural resources [7].&amp;nbsp; A novel approach to correlating a
variety of data sources to understand problems in an area and forecast
conflict is described by [8].&amp;nbsp; In this example, the potential
conflict is the weak signal that is detected through the correlation of
diverse datasets describing many features of the region, to include
demographic, political, social, economic, educational, agricultural,
weather, etc.&amp;nbsp; A key challenge in integrating these disparate
data is the semantic meaning implicit in the components of the overall
structure of the region.The challenges with this approach include the
following.&amp;nbsp; First, a method for collecting various datasets for
 a region of interest and correlating these for overall understanding
and meaning is a nontrivial task.&amp;nbsp; Many of the datasets are
based on different scales and involve different referents to the
population or the environment.&amp;nbsp; Second, a weighting scale must
be developed sufficient to provide representational meaning and
inferential capabilities to the reasoning tool.&amp;nbsp; Third, a
visual representation must be developed sufficient for a human to reason
 about the correlations; a display that provides all of the facts but
does not suggest inferences is insufficient and meaningless.&amp;nbsp;
Finally, a performance measurement capability is needed to compare the
reasoning analytics to reasonable expectations for use of such a
tool.&amp;nbsp; Quantitative and qualitative metrics will be needed for
such an application.This topic seeks to address these challenges by
developing and implementing a technique for correlating multiple
datasets for a region of interest, weighting significant factors, and
producing a set of forecasting alerts for a human user sufficient to
trigger planning and course of action considerations.&amp;nbsp;PHASE
I:&amp;nbsp; Define requirements for developing and implementing a
technique for building a technique that can be used to detect a
\u2018weak signal\u2019 or troublesome behavior in a population or
region of interest.&amp;nbsp; Requirements definition must include: a
description of the model components and the supporting relationships,
the computational processing technique that will be used and a
description of the integration mechanisms, a determination of the types
and characteristics of the metrics that will be captured and used, a
detailed discussion of the specific domain to be represented, and a
discussion of analysis and assessment techniques to be used.&amp;nbsp;
Phase II plans should also be provided, to include key component
technological milestones and plans for testing and validation of the
proposed system and its components.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Produce
 a prototype system based on the preliminary design from Phase
I.&amp;nbsp; All appropriate engineering testing will be performed, and a
 critical design review will be performed to finalize the
design.&amp;nbsp; Phase II deliverables will include a working prototype
 of the system, specification for its development, and a demonstration
and validation of the ability to both accurately represent the model of
the soft information fusion and the collaborative visual analytics
representation of the data.PHASE III: This technology will have broad
application in military, government, and commercial settings.&amp;nbsp;
Within the military and government, there is an increasing emphasis on
understanding and forecasting group behaviors or regions that are prone
to conflict or environmental degredation.&amp;nbsp; Currently, fusing
information from these multiple and divergent sources is extremely labor
 intensive and costly in terms of labor and time.&amp;nbsp; Developing
models that can forecast likely disruptions to fragile populations or
environments will be a powerful addition to strategic, operational, and
tactical decision making.&amp;nbsp; The proposed effort will enable the
delivery of more informed courses of action supported by tractable
information sources in a display environment that provides multiple
views into the problem space.&amp;nbsp; Commercially, the advanced
sensor technologies have produced unprecedented amount of digital
information and applications by which to sort, collect, and share
data.&amp;nbsp; This sector has also witnessed a surge in analytic
processing, dissemination, and display capabilities.&amp;nbsp;
Harnessing these for multiple uses will reduce the cost of integrating
these techniques and improve the human decision making process.",

        "topic_name": "Collaborative Visual Analytics Approach for
Reasoning in Soft Information Fusion Domains",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Information SystemsOBJECTIVE:
Develop a method and implement a technique for using a collaborative
visual analytics approach to the soft information fusion domain to
enable humans to reason more efficiently in this complex information
space.DESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; Increasingly, information fusion for
strategic and tactical military decisions is driven less by the
traditional physical domain and more by human or \u2018soft\u2019 sensor
 collectors and data products [1].&amp;nbsp; Recent trends in social
networking and advanced computing have contributed to a significant
change in the ways in which humans are represented in the information
fusion domain; as targets and as sources of information [2].&amp;nbsp;
As targets of the fusion system, individuals and groups, operating as
open or hidden networks, are less tractable by physical sensors and the
resulting behavior is difficult to infer and understand in advance of
trigger events [3].&amp;nbsp; As information sources, human reports are
subject to reporting bias, uncertainty, incompleteness, ambiguity,
corruption, and perceptual\/social bias [2, 6].&amp;nbsp; Finally, as
decision makers, humans are distributed in time and space and require
access to collaborative technologies to synchronize data, share
information, and visualize potential courses of action [4].&amp;nbsp; In
 this extremely complicated space, understanding the data and
manipulating the reasoning and display technologies through a user
interface are basic starting points for more advanced capabilities
[5].&amp;nbsp; The field of visual analytics has contributed tools to
allow humans to solve analytical problems similar to those described
above, albeit in a single user environment [7] or in a co-located team
[8].&amp;nbsp; Collaborative Visual Analytics (CVA) is explored by [9],
who describe an environment to allow remote-collaborative information
exploration and task sharing with linked graphical
interfaces.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; CVA has been used by an
interdisciplinary team to predict the impact of global climate change on
 US power grids [10] and emergency response management [12].&amp;nbsp;
The power of CVA for decision making in the soft information fusion
domain stems from the inclusion of the social process of effort sharing,
 discussion, and consensus building [11] as well as the technical
ability for team members to share representations, translate differing
perspectives, articulate arguments, update conclusions, and justify
actions [13].&amp;nbsp;The challenges with this topic are
twofold.&amp;nbsp; First, the soft information fusion domain is often
described as \u2018data rich and model poor\u2019, which leads to the
underlying need for a model that is flexible enough to incorporate
disparate data and structured enough to support a decision maker\u2019s
need to reason about the data.&amp;nbsp; Second, collaborative visual
analytics that can display information relationships and a team of
users\u2019 individual reasoning requirements over those data artifacts
is a complicated proposition and demands careful study and technical
design.&amp;nbsp;The current topic seeks to address those challenges by
developing and implementing a technique for building a collaborative
visual analytics application for reasoning in a soft information fusion
domain.&amp;nbsp; The desired approach includes three
elements.&amp;nbsp; The first element includes developing a semantic
model that can incorporate and parse elements of data into meaningful
representations that are amenable to visual representation and
manipulation.&amp;nbsp; The second element is a performance evaluation
and scoring mechanism by which a user community can be rated on ability
to extract meaningful representations from the data.&amp;nbsp; The last
element requires demonstrating the effectiveness of this capability to
model adaptations based on information inputs and also to assess user
decision making as a function of the collaborative visual applications
in a small team.PHASE I: Define requirements for developing and
implementing a technique for building a semantic model of soft
information fusion that can be used in a collaborative visual analytics
application for a small distributed team.&amp;nbsp; Requirements
definition must include: a description of the model components and the
supporting relationships, the computational processing technique that
will be used and a description of the integration mechanisms, a
determination of the types and characteristics of the metrics that will
be captured and used, a detailed discussion of the specific domain to be
 represented, and a discussion of analysis and assessment techniques to
be used.&amp;nbsp; Phase II plans should also be provided, to include
key component technological milestones and plans for testing and
validation of the proposed system and its
components.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Produce a prototype system

Culturally Significant Information for Enhanced Tactical
Decision-making",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Information SystemsOBJECTIVE:
Using a visual analytics approach, develop a reasoning and display tool
that will enable the visual representation and implementation of
culturally significant information for enhanced tactical decision-making
 in a foreign and hostile environment.DESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; Modern
warfare and conflict environments are drastically different from what
was once considered to be the norm [8].&amp;nbsp; Where once the norm
consisted of countryside \u201cbattlefield combat with distinct front
lines,\u201d modern conflict increasingly occurs in urban areas lacking
distinct boundaries [8], within foreign cultures, where the focus is
centered on the civilian population instead of the battlefield
[1].&amp;nbsp; The discerning combatants from civilians has become
increasingly complex in that combatants are frequently dispersed
throughout the civilian population and without any clear uniform, it can
 be extremely difficult to discern friend from foe [8].&amp;nbsp; To
further complicate combatant and civilian distinctions, a civilian
encountered as such one day may present as a combatant another
[8].&amp;nbsp; The conventional goal of overcoming an armed enemy is
expanding, incorporating goodwill missions where the goal is to win over
 local civilians [8].&amp;nbsp; Operating in foreign environments,
warfighters often find themselves in unfamiliar situations where they
need to know how to resolve a situation appropriately in the context of
an alien culture [4].&amp;nbsp; Due to these expansions in military
conflict norms, sociocultural knowledge has become a critical factor for
 success in modern warfare environments [8].&amp;nbsp; Soldiers must
understand a society\u2019s values, motivations, culture, and
subcultures within in [1].&amp;nbsp; For mission success, it is critical
 for all Soldiers and commanders to maintain cultural situational
awareness when in a foreign environment [1].&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Effective situational awareness depends on the ability to collect data
from many distributed, heterogeneous information-sources and through
visual analytics, display the data so that it facilitates understanding
of evolving events occurring within complex and dynamic environments
[3].&amp;nbsp; The military has applied visualization techniques to
enhance decision making [2].&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Incorporating
culturally significant information into a military database accessible
by Soldiers and commanders will enhance decision-making.The challenges
with this topic are threefold.&amp;nbsp; First, building and maintaining
 foreign cultural awareness and understanding societies where military
operations are conducted has not always been a priority of the U.S.
military [7].&amp;nbsp; It has been suggested that the lack of
preliminary efforts to understand the local populace and culture that
our forces operate in resulted in many of the early challenges
encountered during Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom (OEF
and OEF) [7].&amp;nbsp; Therefore, we are having back-track in order to
develop and share cultural awareness while still immersed in these
foreign cultures, and situations that have been exasperated by our lack
of sociocultural awareness.&amp;nbsp; Secondly, there are many
challenges regarding data&amp;nbsp; collection, entry, management, and
quality.&amp;nbsp; For instance, in regards to data entry, a large issue
 occurs with entity resolution and relationship awareness.&amp;nbsp; How
 will a user discern two individuals with the same name?&amp;nbsp;
Answering these questions as well as exploring how to best visually
represent this information to a user will be some challenges developers
will confront. Regarding data quality, given that information may be
coming from many different sources, data may overlap, be incomplete, or
incorrect [5].&amp;nbsp; Determining how to overcome and compensate for
these issues is an ongoing challenge for developers. Developers will
have to determine how to fuse information collected from various types
of data sources into meaningful information that will enhance human
understanding without increasing user stress [3] and while compensating
for any data errors [5].&amp;nbsp;The current topic seeks to address
these challenges by developing and implementing a visual analytics
technique for representing culturally significant information for
enhanced tactical decision-making.&amp;nbsp; This will include
developing a semantic model that can incorporate and parse elements of
data into meaningful representations that are amenable to visual
representation and manipulation.&amp;nbsp; Visual representations for
sociocultural data that would prove critical for military operations
regarding mission planning, hostile conflicts, and goodwill
encounters.&amp;nbsp; Visual and computer analytics should be employed
to develop soft information and multi-source data fusion
techniques.&amp;nbsp; The tool should enable reasoning so that the
sociocultural information could be applied to relevant mission scenarios
 such as route planning.PHASE I: Define requirements for developing and
implementing a technique for building a reasoning and display tool for
enhanced visual representation of culturally significant information to
promote commander decision making.&amp;nbsp; Requirements definition
must include: a description of the model components and the supporting
relationships, the computational processing technique that will be used
and a description of the integration mechanisms, a determination of the
types and characteristics of the metrics that will be captured and used,
 a detailed discussion of the specific domain to be represented, and a
discussion of analysis and assessment techniques to be used.&amp;nbsp;
Phase II plans should also be provided, to include key component
technological milestones and plans for testing and validation of the
proposed system and its components.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Produce
 a prototype system based on the preliminary design from Phase
I.&amp;nbsp; All appropriate engineering testing will be performed, and a
 critical design review will be performed to finalize the
design.&amp;nbsp; Phase II deliverables will include a working prototype
 of the system, specification for its development, and a demonstration
and validation of the ability to both accurately represent the model of
the soft information fusion and the collaborative visual analytics
representation of the data.PHASE III: This technology will have broad
application in military, government, and commercial settings.&amp;nbsp;

understanding sociocultural norms and behaviors of communities in
foreign nations that are potentially hostile to US and Coalition
interests.&amp;nbsp; Currently, fusing information from these sources is

through Collaborative Visual Approaches",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Information SystemsOBJECTIVE:
Provide a technology application that builds semantic knowledge through
metadata tagging capabilities and collaborative visual approaches, and
includes multi-modal data feeds including text and visual
data.DESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; Today\u2019s information systems generate
massive amounts of data and the areas of Defense and Homeland Security
have the difficult task of quickly understanding and determining the
crucial information from complex data systems [2,8].&amp;nbsp; Visual
data mining and collaborative visual approaches to information can help
handle the influx of information [6].&amp;nbsp; There is a corpus of
data that, if sufficient data mining capabilities existed, could aid
intelligence analysts in understanding information in near-real time
[3].&amp;nbsp; A system that can extract information automatically from
various multi-modal data sources and the efficient customization of a
system to a new domain while defining a set of features and extraction
rules are challenging tasks [1,7].&amp;nbsp; Many of the current
folksomies do not control for spelling variations, synonyms, or
clarification of homonyms.&amp;nbsp; Controlled vocabularies such as a
thesauri, classification schemes, and tools such as spell check or
\u201ctext of 9 keys (T9)\u201d could vastly reduce errors within
reported data, improve search quality as well as enhance information
discovery within a large database system [4].&amp;nbsp; Even if we could
 mine information via the tagged data, it is useless to users if it
cannot be analyzed and employed in an operational setting [5].&amp;nbsp;
 These controlled tags should be easily accessible and users should be
able to select and change appropriate tags at any time.&amp;nbsp; An
application with various user defined displays and layouts would be most
 useful in building semantic knowledge [2].Challenges for this topic
include 1) identifying relevant multi-modal data sets that incorporate
various forms of text and visual data, 2) determine an effective tagging
 technique that can be used to increase accuracy of information systems,
 3) develop a method to run the application with supporting tags in a
pre-existing system, 4) demonstrate the ability to search and\/or
navigate the tagged database, 5) show the application\u2019s capability
for visual analysis with various display options that can be utilized by
 distributed collaborative teams, 6) demonstrate the usefulness of this
application in the broad realms of military, government, and commercial
settings.PHASE I: Develop a research plan that establishes the proof of
concept for the application that will enable data tagging capabilities
within a pre-existing large data set including text and visual
data.&amp;nbsp; Describe how the increased tagging abilities will
support advanced searching and integrated visual analysis of various
display options.&amp;nbsp; Estimate the technical feasibility and value
of the system and identify the essential technology issues that must be
overcome to achieve success.&amp;nbsp; Prepare a comprehensive research
and development proposal for Phase II that includes critical plans for
testing and evaluation of the system and its components.PHASE II: Based
on the preliminary plans of Phase I, produce a prototype application
that is capable of enabling the tagging of various forms of data within
an existing data set.&amp;nbsp; The prototype should lead to a
demonstration of the capability.&amp;nbsp; Test the prototype in a large
 multi-sensor database including text and visual data to demonstrate the
 technical feasibility and merit of the product.&amp;nbsp; Demonstrate a
 capability of enhanced data search capabilities that return relevant
and related information for analysis that can be displayed in a variety
of display options.&amp;nbsp; Propose a verification and validation
process.PHASE III: Produce an application capable of deployment in an
operational setting that can be utilized by distributed collaborative
teams.&amp;nbsp; Test the system in an operational setting as a
component of a larger pre-existing multi-sensor database.&amp;nbsp; The
application should provide metrics for performance assessment.&amp;nbsp;

Threat Modeling and Threat Prediction",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Information
SystemsOBJECTIVE:&amp;nbsp; Innovative approaches to Situation Modeling,
 Threat Modeling and Threat Prediction for improved Situational
Awareness.DESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; The Joint Directors of Laboratories
(JDL) Subpanel on Data Fusion has defined Data Fusion as \u201ca process
 dealing with the association, correlation, and combination of data and
information from single and multiple sources to achieve refined position
 and identity estimates, and complete and timely assessments of
situations and threats, and their significance.&amp;nbsp; The process is
 characterized by continuous refinements of its estimates and
assessments, and the evaluation of the need for additional sources, or
modification of the process itself, to achieve improved
results\u201d.Steinberg, et al [Reference 1] later defined data fusion
as \u201cthe process of combining data to refine state estimates and
predictions.\u201d A breakout of the functional levels [1] is:\u2022
Level 0 - Sub-Object Data Assessment: estimation and prediction of
signal\/object observable states on the basis of pixel\/signal level
data association and characterization;\u2022 Level 1 - Object
Assessment:&amp;nbsp; estimation and prediction of entity states on the
basis of observation-to-track association, continuous state estimation
(e.g. kinematics) and discrete state estimation (e.g.&amp;nbsp; target
type and ID);\u2022 Level 2 - Situation Assessment:&amp;nbsp; estimation
 and prediction of relations among entities, to include force structure
and cross force relations, communications and perceptual influences,
physical context, etc.;\u2022 Level 3 - Impact Assessment: estimation
and prediction of effects on situations of planned or
estimated\/predicted actions by the participants; to include
interactions between action plans of multiple players (e.g. assessing
susceptibilities and vulnerabilities to estimated\/predicted threat
actions given one's own planned actions);\u2022 Level 4 - Process
Refinement (an element of Resource Management): adaptive data
acquisition and processing to support mission objectives.To date the
majority of data fusion research, development, and applications focus
primarily on the lowest levels of data fusion (e.g., Level 1 \u2013
Object Refinement).&amp;nbsp; The higher levels of information fusion
(HLF) are inadequately being addressed, in particular the areas of
Situation Modeling, Threat Modeling, and Threat Prediction.&amp;nbsp;
This SBIR effort will therefore address these three domains, taking into
 account bias, uncertainty, and ambiguity within the data.The specific
area of research to be addressed for this topic is: research,
development and application of novel methods to model and characterize
the quality of data when it is reused for alternative purposes. This
includes estimating the uncertainty or error in the resulting analysis
due to the alternative data usage. The data that are available for reuse
 could include a mixture of quantitative\/qualitative data types and are
 from structured and unstructured repositories or sources.Impact: One
could understand what is missing in the data and fill in the gaps by
gaining a better understanding of how and why the original data were
collected. Of particular interest are situations where data are gathered
 across different domains (physical, non-physical, cyber, medical, etc.)
 and are subsequently used for analysis in another domain.PHASE I: The
proposal for Phase I should identify an innovative approach for
improving situational awareness through the use of novel methods to
model and characterize the quality of data when it is reused for
alternative purposes.&amp;nbsp; This includes estimating the uncertainty
 or error in the resulting analysis due to the alternative data usage.
The data that are available for reuse could include a mixture of
quantitative\/qualitative data types and are from structured and
unstructured repositories or sources.&amp;nbsp; The study should provide
 a detailed discussion on uncertain, incomplete and ambiguous
data\/information and how it is used in the Higher Level Fusion
process.PHASE II: In Phase II, development of a prototype Higher Level
Information Fusion system based on the Phase I design.&amp;nbsp;
Demonstrate the developed Higher Level Information Fusion prototype to
prove feasibility for improving situational awareness by novel methods
to model and characterize the quality of data when it is reused for
alternative purposes through the development of novel methods to model
and characterize the quality of data when it is reused for alternative
purposes.PHASE III Dual Use Applications: There are many dual use
applications of Information Fusion techniques.&amp;nbsp; For example in
the law enforcement community, this research could be applied to counter
 narcotics arena or Homeland Defense.&amp;nbsp; On the commercial side,
this research is applicable to business intelligence, where companies
attempt to determine what their competitors are doing by collecting and
analyzing data available over the web.",

Environment",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Information SystemsOBJECTIVE:
Design and implement a populated architecture that can quickly and
efficiently discover actionable tactical information contained or
derived from large parallel data stores.&amp;nbsp; A user friendly
interface should be able to translate a condition of interest into a
parallelized map reduce job.&amp;nbsp; The system should also be able to
 recognize redundancies in data held within large parallel data stores
to prevent sparse evidence from being viewed as a well supported
inference.&amp;nbsp; The mature system should provide a common data
currency for exchange across a large parallel enterprise through use of
data dictionaries, shared ontologies and maps to data sources.&amp;nbsp;
 A request for unusual events must be understand in the context of many
types of data and many different types of mission information
requirements.&amp;nbsp; All data and services should be discoverable by a
 tactical user equipped with only a PDA.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: In
combating terrorism the need exists to monitor at risk individuals and
groups.&amp;nbsp; The data sources to achieve this goal can consist of
military sensors and sources as well as open source
literature.&amp;nbsp; Key data types that may contain valued information
 include unstructured text, audio files, images, high resolution
imagery, wide area airborne imagery and biometric data&amp;nbsp;
Currently, there does not exist a way to run specific searches in
response to a tactical information need against large distributed data
stores.&amp;nbsp; Sensor data can be 1) stored in a large data archive
for retrieval and extraction, 2) kept at an aggregation node (gateway),
or 3) remain close to smart sensor and triggers provided for data
distribution. The goal of the topic is to mature a set of map reduce
tools that can address key warfighter questions quickly by fusing
interim results obtained by running code in parallel across numerous
multi-INT data stores.&amp;nbsp; Map reduce jobs must be configured and
activated by an easy to use tactical PDA based user interface that
understands the language commonly used to express priority and specific
information requirements.&amp;nbsp; After a single knowledge product is
produced from the combination of many work tasks applied across many
data stores, that product must be delivered to the warfighter.&amp;nbsp;
 The matured system must be able to produce answers in real
time.&amp;nbsp; For this topic, offerors may work with the following
distributed data sources; warfighter observations containing
time\/location stamps and unstructured text, images with time\/location
stamps and unstructured text comments; and biometric reports containing
time\/location stamps.&amp;nbsp; Phase 1 performers may work with
synthetic data.&amp;nbsp; The Hadoop framework should be
utilized.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The offeror should work towards a
capability to allow a warfighter to ask for activity reports relevant to
 a location over a specified time and receive a summary derived from the
 content of distributed data stores.&amp;nbsp; The specific challenges
of this topic include:&amp;nbsp; 1) Maturing a set of related map reduce
 jobs that can act on distributed stored images\/imagery, unstructured
text and biometrics data to find data that relates to a priority or
specific information requirement&amp;nbsp; 2) Development of a level one
 fusion engine based on FrameNet that can combine the output of a number
 of map reduce jobs run against a distributed data store to produce a
single knowledge product 3) Development of a user GUI that allows the
warfighter to input a time\/space bounded information requirements and
be returned successfully mined information 4)&amp;nbsp; development of
semantic search map reduce jobs and a PDA triggered workflow
manager.&amp;nbsp;Research in the areas of mathematics, statistics,
computational data analysis and visualization, computational sciences
and computer science are of interest.&amp;nbsp; In addition to the
application of research methods and approaches, it is important to
evaluate the impact of these efforts areas with regards to the way they
change how data is collected, analyzed and assessed to meet a prescribed
 time for operational necessity and efficiency.&amp;nbsp; It is of value
 to use open standards to reduce costs [4].The OSD is interested in
innovative R&amp;amp;D that involves technical risk.&amp;nbsp; Proposed
work should have technical and scientific merit.&amp;nbsp; Creative
solutions are encouraged.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Complete a plan and detailed
 approach for populating an architecture that can address warfighter
questions by simultaneously processing multi-INT distributed data
stores.&amp;nbsp; Identify the critical technology issues that must be
overcome to achieve success.&amp;nbsp; Technical work should focus on
the reduction of key risk areas.&amp;nbsp; For a constrained set of
warfighter questions and distributed data stores, demonstrate that phase
 1 risk reduction work has shown that a full implementation of the
approach is technically tractable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Prepare
 a revised research plan for Phase 2 that addresses critical
issues.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Produce a prototype system that is capable of
 distributed processing in a cloud environment.&amp;nbsp; The prototype
system should assemble information by automated means, provide
performance metrics and offer visualization appropriate to user\u2019s
device.&amp;nbsp; Produce a prototype distributed processing service
that can produce accurate answers to warfighter questions by
simultaneously processing large distributed varied data
sources.&amp;nbsp; The prototype should enable a demonstration of the
capability to be conducted using relevant data sources, some of which
may be classified.&amp;nbsp; The prototype should be capable of
operating in a real time mode.&amp;nbsp; Identify appropriate test
performance dependent variables and make trade-off studies. Address bias
 in data processing due to redundant sampling. The prototype should be
relevant to both DoD and commercial use cases.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III:

semiconductor electronic devices, especially in silicon carbide (SiC),
for improved efficiency and high-temperature (100 to 200 \u00baC)
operation.&amp;nbsp; SiC Schottky diodes are beginning to be broadly
incorporated into power electronic systems, with the expectation that
SiC-based power switches (such as MOSFETs and JFETs) will soon
follow.&amp;nbsp; Design of efficient SiC-based power systems requires a
 detailed understanding of the circuit operation of SiC power devices.
Compact circuit models with a high degree of accuracy, yet portable, are
 critical to the design process and require fast device models.Much work
 has gone into developing device models to accurately predict
performance of individual devices and such devices are now commercially
available. There is a need to develop the next level of models to
provide circuit designers the ability to evaluate circuits that utilize
these devices such as been done for silicon-based electronic packages.
These models will need to take into account the multi-disciplinary
modeling requirements to accurately predict how the devices will
function in circuits. The models should address electrical, thermal,
mechanical, and material calculations while providing the designer
accurate results in steady state, time, and frequency domains.
Particular challenges include the development of high-speed models
appropriate for circuit level design while maintaining the accuracy of
models based on first principles from device physics, thermodynamics,
heat transfer, mechanics, and material science.PHASE I: Provide initial
innovative device modeling that can enable the reliable design of SiC
power circuits. Demonstrate the feasibility of expanding the initial
modeling concept to all design criteria desired in the above
description.&amp;nbsp; All models should be scalable and of flexible use
 for multiple applications.PHASE II: Develop and mature the model from
Phase I to include electrical, thermal, mechanical, and material
calculations. The model\u2019s reliability should be demonstrated on at
least two independent SiC circuits of differing utility while providing
accurate results in steady state, time, and frequency
domains.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III: Further expand the utility of the model
under varying circuit design and conditions while enhancing portability.

        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Information
SystemsOBJECTIVE:&amp;nbsp; Develop software protection systems that are
 difficult to exploit once an adversary gains
entry.DESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; State-of-the-art software protection and
anti-tamper systems are built based upon three basic tenets: (1) reduce
system susceptibilities, (2) move critical information out-of-band to
the attacker, and (2) reduce the effectiveness of our adversaries\u2019
capabilities through detection, response and adaptive mechanisms
[1].&amp;nbsp; For the most part, however, computer, sensor, and weapons
 systems are built using untrusted commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)
parts.&amp;nbsp; Supply chain threats to critical components, such as
hardware or firmware Trojans, have invalidated the assumption that we
can move our critical software and data \u201cout-of-band\u201d to the
adversary, such as in a hypervisor or on \u201csecure\u201d hardware,
since the hardware components on which the software ultimately executes
is untrusted [2].&amp;nbsp; Detection techniques currently being
researched to address this class of threat, while important and useful,
only reduce the likelihood of exploitation, not eliminate it; and it is
only a matter of time before those measures fail.&amp;nbsp; In short,
the concept of keeping an adversary outside of a protected volume,
layer, or device has been completely eroded by supply chain
threats.&amp;nbsp; As a result, one must take a long-term strategic view
 and assume in designing protection systems that an unknown subset of
the system on which that software executes (e.g., an integrated circuit,
 printed circuit board, or subsystem) will eventually be
compromised.&amp;nbsp;While novel techniques have been proposed for
mitigating low-level persistent threats, such as firmware and hardware
Trojans in COTS hard disk drives and other peripherals in desktop
systems, the typical attack surface of a computer or weapon system is so
 large that these approaches and concepts, even if successfully applied
to these devices, will not scale to protect the entire system.&amp;nbsp;
 One must, therefore, re-think the fundamental approach to building
software protection and anti-tamper systems.&amp;nbsp; The goal of this
topic is to maintain mission assurance and the protection of the
critical intellectual property in the event a subset of the system is
exploited (e.g., due to supply chain compromise).Desired architectural
attributes of the protection system include, but are not limited to,
dynamic\/maneuverable protections that force the adversary to exploit a
moving target; systems that distributed\/fractionate [3] the critical
information being protected and force the adversary to attack multiple
nodes simultaneously to avoid attack mitigation; redundant systems that
maintain mission assurance even in the presence of a subset of
compromised and exploited end-nodes; heterogeneous systems that force
the development of multiple attack delivery methods and payloads;
metamorphism that changes the perceived operational environment and
targeted vulnerabilities, and disruptive techniques that break command
and control of malicious agents to prevent exploitation.PHASE
I:&amp;nbsp; 1) Design and architect a software protection system
containing one or more of the above-mentioned attributes.&amp;nbsp;
Development of a minimal prototype to demonstrate feasibility would be
beneficial, but is not required provided sufficient design documentation
 is made available. 2) Develop metrics and a strategy for measuring the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.&amp;nbsp; 3) Produce a detailed
research report outlining the design and architecture of the system, as
well as the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach.PHASE
II: 1) Based on the results from Phase I, design and implement a fully
functioning prototype solution.&amp;nbsp; 2) Provide test and evaluation
 results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall
system.&amp;nbsp; 3) Develop a final report completely describing the
design and architecture.PHASE III DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS:&amp;nbsp; The
technology developed under this research topic will maintain mission
assurance in the presence of compromised end-nodes and exploited
subsystems. DoD applications that will benefit from this technology
include a wide range of embedded, sensor, navigation, avionics, and
communication systems.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Commercial applications
include financial, communication, and SCADA systems.&amp;nbsp; As a

 on Software Protection Systems",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Information
SystemsOBJECTIVE:&amp;nbsp; Develop innovative countermeasures to
attacks on critical software using software decoys and
deception.DESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; The effective use of deception in
traditional warfare dates back thousands of years [1].&amp;nbsp; Most
notably, its effective use has been demonstrated in World War II [2] and
 Operation Desert Storm [1].&amp;nbsp; However, research on the use of
software decoys and deception, as a defensive mechanism in software
protection systems is currently limited.&amp;nbsp; There are a number of
 possible reasons for this.&amp;nbsp; First, deceptive techniques do not
 (by themselves) provide secure systems, since they often are dependent
on the mindset of the adversary, which is either not known or not well
modeled.&amp;nbsp; Secondly, deception techniques are often viewed as
\u2018single use\u2019 technology, since once the deception is exposed
that particular deceptive technique can no longer be used in the same
scenario.&amp;nbsp; Third, software decoys often cannot be generalized
and require tailoring by subject matter experts to make them
indistinguishable from the legitimate applications that are the target
of attack.&amp;nbsp; Software deception [3] has, therefore, become a
highly underutilized tactic in an overall strategy to defeat cyber
attacks by providing a layered defense.To remedy the disadvantages noted
 above, we desire to develop a software deception strategy and
architecture, with techniques that can measurably increase the
effectiveness of software protection systems with statistical
significance.&amp;nbsp; This topic will contribute to an overall plan to
 understand the adversary\u2019s strategies and tactics in order to
build real-time adaptive software protection systems.&amp;nbsp;
Components to the plan include inferring adversarial intent to determine
 the purpose of the attack; extracting adversarial reasoning to
determine our opponents goals and strategy in order to predict their
\u2018next move\u2019, and the use of deception for tactical advantages,
 including attack misdirection and avoidance.&amp;nbsp; Research areas
of interest include, but are not limited to, the use of deception for
(1) adversarial intent (2) adversarial reasoning [4], (3) attacker
attribution, (4) attack avoidance\/delay, and (5) intelligence
gathering.PHASE I:&amp;nbsp; 1) Develop a strategy and architecture
using software decoys and deception as a countermeasure to attacks on
critical software and data.&amp;nbsp; 2) Develop a concept for building
individual software decoys and deceptive techniques that will plug into
the overall system, and design one or more individual decoys or
deceptive techniques, 3) Develop metrics and a strategy for measuring
the effectiveness of the proposed decoys and\/or deceptive
techniques.&amp;nbsp; 4) Produce a detailed research report outlining
the design and architecture of the system, as well as the advantages and
 disadvantages of the proposed approach.PHASE II: 1) Based on the

        "topic_name": "Identification of Critical Resources and Cyber
Threats in the Physical Domain",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Information SystemsOBJECTIVE:
The focus of this research is to develop an innovative system that
assists users in rapidly identifying and mapping cyberspace and physical
 infrastructure to analyze critical threats and vulnerabilities that
impact both DOD force projection and mission assurance.DESCRIPTION:
Cyber attacks have become a significant threat for DoD operations that
are increasingly more connected and integrated. As DoD relies more on
commercial support for communication, troop movement, bases logistical
infrastructure support, the threat to those operations from a cyber
warfare perspective increases. Much research has been performed to date;
 however there is a strong need for technologies that automatically
discover and correlate physical threats to or critical centralization of
 cyber resources. Current cyber and network defense is too focused on
virtual resources alone. Almost all cyber defense is performed \u201con
the network\u201d ignoring other critical factors. These methods often
ignore threats in the physical (kinetic) domain. Importantly, these
threats can go both ways. &amp;nbsp;For example, a physical threat to a
military installation can map to a particular threat source, but cyber
threats can map to multiple communication nodes across multiple DoD
networks without geographic constraints. Proposed solutions should allow
 users to easily provide mappings, automatically identify as many
mappings as possible, and provide mechanisms to incorporate new
discovery schemes. Furthermore, the solution should help users quickly
identify single-points of failure and to measure criticality of
components. Commercial, government, DoD, and ad-hoc networks have become
 nearly ubiquitous. Through extensive abstraction, heterogeneous systems
 interconnect and interoperate. Unfortunately, these abstractions make
system characterization difficult at best. For example, an organization
may lease network resources from two different providers for redundancy.
 These networks may be carried on a single fiber, owned by a common
single carrier further upstream. For example, long-haul fiber and Dense
Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) network increase the likelihood
that multiple carriers share physical infrastructure. Further,
off-network infrastructure requirements such as power, cooling, and
maintenance complicate an assessment. The focus of this research is
threefold. First involves the development of a methodology for gathering
 the critical cyberspace and physical data. Second, it involves the
development of algorithms, tools, and techniques to automatically
generate mappings of virtual to physical resources, and to isolate
critical components. The third is the development of a modular
operations visualization and analysis framework. New technologies are
needed to gather data, assess vulnerabilities, identify critical
dependencies and develop capabilities to help in understanding the 1st,
2nd, and 3rd order of effects to DOD when critical infrastructure like
power plants, air traffic control systems, sensor webs, and the
electrical grid do not perform correctly. The new framework should allow
 for quick integration of data sources, provide intuitive visualization
(such as a geo-located threats on a world map), and allow users to
manually map between the cyber and physical domains to support decision
aiding and assessment. The framework and these data should be structured
 such that future components can analyze the multi-domain model for
effective and innovative operations.PHASE I: Develop a design that will
acquire, store, map, and visualize information linking cyber and
physical resources in a coherent operational picture. Technical work
should focus on reducing risk for future phases and developing key
technologies to facilitate future work. Special attention should be paid
 to gathering the data, to identifying potentially complex mappings and
identifying gaps. Phase I will include a proof of feasibility of key
enabling technologies.PHASE II: Develop prototype software that can be
accredited at Technical Readiness Level 6 (TRL 6), that will effectively
 acquire, store, manipulate and present the cyber threat and
infrastructure data. Create an effective demonstration that uses
representative data to provide proof of concept for computer network
defense systems that defend against emerging threats.PHASE III --
DUAL-USE COMMERCIALIZATION: Military Application: Military operations
through cyber attacks and the ability to quickly and efficiently
identify threats and vulnerability to infrastructure as they relate to
cyber assets. Commercial Application: The monitoring, identification,
and reconstitution of cyber threats is a critical component of overall
readiness and infrastructure information to both the planners and first
responders.",

Visualization and Decision Support System",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Information SystemsOBJECTIVE:
Develop dynamically adjustable trustworthiness metrics that are tuned to
 human relevance and to automated protocols and that can be manipulated
with a highly abstract, tangible interface.DESCRIPTION: During a cyber
attack, Continuity of Operations, or other high-rate dynamic context
shift of events, trustworthiness metrics can be so dynamic that
cyberspace operators need a real-time high-abstraction interface that
enables on-the-fly control of autonomic systems. Allowing users to
control the scope of what they believe is currently relevant may help
enable autonomic and net-centric system of systems to aid the operation
of highly volatile situations encountered during net-enabled spectrum
warfare.Cyberspace analysts must monitor vast amounts of information to
enable secure and effective operations. There are human and automated
protocols in place to support this activity, but the subsequent
presentation of this information is not optimized. Therefore, the intent
 of this research is to develop a simple-looking visualization and
control system that semi-automatically adjusts to events of relevance in
 the cyberspace domain in an intuitive way to provide only the
appropriate trustworthiness metrics needed for the human supervision of
the autonomic trust protocols.By allowing very high abstraction control
of the top four to seven (+\/- 2) things that users care most about at
the moment of use (see citations 5 &amp;amp; 6 below), the system could
re-orient the display based on the dynamic scope control of an
underlying ontology representing the breadth of many possible
trustworthiness measures that may be of interest at different phases of
sensor system of system operation and context of use. By allowing the
system to dynamically choose scope using abstract representations like
topic maps (see 1 below), the appropriate trustworthiness metrics would
be presented to the user and subsequent demand for that kind of data
passed to relevant cyberspace systems for cyber protocol tasking and
refinement of data fusion and data analysis.With the convergence of
several streams of technology and with new understanding from the social
 sciences, a new capability has emerged in the visualization and control
 of cyber security systems. Protocols for maintaining operator trust are
 based on trustworthiness metrics of the underlying computer and
communication systems that are context dependent. Some protocols may be
more efficaciously invoked than others depending on the situation. Which
 protocols the system invokes may be determined before hand by the
weightings and priorities of decision support algorithms, but those
traditional artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches have
 yet to enable fully automated control of sophisticated protocols across
 the vast array of possible situations that may arise. Therefore, a
mixed initiative human-machine system is required that blends initiative
 taken by human operators with their automated systems.Mixed-initiative
control is premised on functional abstraction hierarchy representations
that look like a work-breakdown structure of activity from strategic
level objectives down to actual protocol invocation by automated
systems. Adjustment of the displayed level of abstraction requires a
dynamic representation of the context to know what is most important for
 the user to see at any given moment. The traditional means of
addressing visualization and control of trustworthiness metrics have
been tried and found wanting (4 &amp;amp; 7), and are therefore excluded
 from this call for proposals unless they include novel application of
emerging technologies. One such possibility has emerged from the
convergence of three schools of diverse disciplines of Topic Maps,
Tangible Interfaces and Sandplay Therapy. (1, 2 &amp;amp; 3) This
convergence may be further aided by the advance in electronic location
technologies such as RFID. A final enabler of this convergence is the
growing youth culture of gaming. Combining gaming culture\u2019s use of
tangible and computer displays with the social, psychological and
computer interface technologies could be a convergence that allows for a
 long sought advance in high abstraction interfaces that control other
displays, algorithms and devices while being tightly synchronized with
the current situation and context of use for easy manipulation by a
user. Thus, proposals are being sought that offer any effective set of
novel combinations of new and emerging interdisciplinary technologies
while excluding solutions that offer single discipline, traditional
approaches.The goal of this topic is to conduct new and innovative,
interdisciplinary research and development in technologies for selecting
 appropriate trustworthiness protocols using advanced human\/machine
interfaces for the visualization and control in a cyberspace security
contexts of use.PHASE I: Phase I activity shall include: Design and
develop new visualization and control interface technologies that finds
the relevant subset of trust measures and uses these to adjust context
dependent trustworthiness metrics, which will thus enable semi-automated
 use of trust maintenance protocols and demonstrate a proof-of-principle
 prototype for a cyberspace security scenario that shows the control of
high abstraction representations and their linkage to underlying
trustworthiness metrics.PHASE II: The researcher shall develop and
demonstrate a comprehensive prototype implementing the Phase I
technologies to show ability for extending this to many relevant
trustworthiness metrics for cyberspace use cases with several realistic
trust protocols and demonstrating a high abstraction representation and
interface controlling automated trust maintenance protocols. The
researcher shall detail the Phase III plan.PHASE III -- DUAL USE

security applied to Command, Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance (C2ISR), Electronic Warfare Battle Management or sensor
resource management.Commercial application: This system would benefit
any commercial application dealing with gaming and psychology research

        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Information
SystemsOBJECTIVE:&amp;nbsp; The objective of this SBIR topic is to
design and develop a method for reliable and deterministic detection
method for hijacked execution (D2HE), and to evaluate its capability,
performance, and cost.DESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; Achieving information
dominance requires Department of Defense (DoD) to provide information
assurance within its information infrastructures. COTS based hardware
and software in our computing systems and the network are large, complex
 and hence inherently insecure. Malwares and adversaries regularly
exploit our inherently insecure computing infrastructure.&amp;nbsp; Many
 approaches have been used to detect malwares and adversarial intrusion
activities. The approach varies from detecting the malware signatures,
heuristics behavior monitoring, white-listing, marking data entering the
 system (taint tracking), etc. However, even with all of these security
mechanisms, malwares and adversaries still manage to penetrate our
system.One of the often used detection approaches is to insert
checkpoints or assertions into the body of the program via code
rewriting process. The location of the check points can be derived from
code-analysis or from formal model of the program. This approach can be
effective in detecting error and improper state in a program. An issue
with this approach, in an adversarial situation, is that if the
execution of the program is maliciously diverted by an adversary (or
malware), the subsequent checkpoint may never be reached, and the
execution flow diversion may never raise any alarm.It is desirable to
have a reliable and deterministic alarm which will always ring every
time a program is hijacked. The word reliable indicates that the alarm
cannot be circumvented and deterministic means that the detection
mechanism is has 0% false positive (not statistical or probabilistic).
Furthermore, it can be observed that a simple mechanism operating on one
 or small number of invariants, as oppose to complex state\/rule-based
system operating on multiple events\/sequence of events, such as
behavior based detection [3][4][5], may be advantageous for achieving 0%
 false positive while minimizing false negatives. An example of a
deterministic method for recognizing hijacked execution is the venerable
 taint-tracking method [1][2]. An invariant in this case is a physical
and\/or logical condition which always occurs during execution
hijacking, for example, an external data\/string being executed during
execution hijacking is the invariant used in the taint tracking methods
[1][2].Understanding of the invariants in an execution hijacking process
 plays important roles in deterministically recognizing it. The
challenge in this topic is to develop a reliable and deterministic
detection method for hijacked execution, making use of one or small
number of the invariant properties of the execution hijacking
process.PHSE I:&amp;nbsp; Design and develop an efficient method for a
reliable and deterministic detection method for hijacked execution flow
(D2HE).&amp;nbsp; Develop a proof of concept prototype for D2HE in an
open-source OS environment, and investigate its cost and
effectiveness.PHASE II:&amp;nbsp; Further develop and mature D2HE
method, develop a full scale D2HE protected system, and perform
full-scale evaluation on the system.PHASE III Dual Use
Application:&amp;nbsp; This system could be used in a broad range of
information security products within the military, as well as in
civilian enterprise applications. The technologies developed in this
SBIR will be beneficial in providing additional resiliency to networked

SystemsOBJECTIVE:&amp;nbsp; Develop innovative software protection
technology containing the ability to support the active defense of
critical software applications.DESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; Current software
application defenses are largely passive in nature [1].&amp;nbsp; When
an attack is detected, these defenses often impose indirect penalties
(e.g., deleting cryptographic keys or zeroing memory) in such a manner
that it forces the adversary to reacquire the software and hardware
assets, but impose no real-time penalties on the attacker that prevent
the application from becoming compromised in the first place [2] [3].The
 focus of this topic is to develop intelligent and cooperative software
protection agents that can deploy active defensive countermeasures [4]
and be used in conjunction with other forms of software
protection.&amp;nbsp; The desired software protection system should meet
 the following requirements: (1) have the ability to monitor, in
real-time, protected end-nodes and report suspicious activity indicating
 a possible attack; (2) have the ability to gather forensic information
on the protected host related to the attack; (3) have the ability to
synthesize and assess the collected information to form a response to an
 attack; and (4) have the ability to impose direct penalties on the
attacker within the boundaries of the protected host or network
environment.The software protection solution should contain the ability
to perform surveillance as well as protection, and should have the
ability to discriminate between a legitimate user and an
attacker.&amp;nbsp; Using the captured surveillance information, the
solution should have the ability to react to an attack (e.g.,

interest includes, but is not limited to, knowledge of the
attacker\u2019s behavior, attack tools and methods used, the type of
information being sought in the attack, and the origin of
attack.&amp;nbsp; In the absence of connectivity with human operators,
the active defensive system must have the ability to act autonomously

criteria.&amp;nbsp; Proportional and subtle responses to an attack are
important elements in the protection scheme.&amp;nbsp; Responses must
only occur once it is determined with a high degree of certainty that
the host or network the application resides on is under attack or has
been compromised, and the proposal should specify a policy for when such
 penalties will be invoked and with what severity.An example of a system
 employing active defense is a protection system that (upon attack
detection) can intelligently and proportionally respond to the attack,
including sending a warning to a system administrator for a benign
policy violation, redirecting an attacker to a honeypot for intelligence
 gathering, terminating a network connection, or covertly degrading the

property by preventing attacks in real-time, gathering forensic evidence
 concerning the attack, or invoking a penalty on the attacker; and as
such will find application in both the government and commercial
sectors.&amp;nbsp; Commercial applications can use the active defensive
software protection technology described above to monitor, control,
debug, configure, authenticate, update, and patch critical software and

broadband networks supporting consumer activities (i.e., entertainment,

Education Networks (RENs) supporting largescale science experiments at
major academic, industry, and government research institutions. Further
complications arise when application traffic crosses multiple network
domains, as a performance problem anywhere along the path will be
visible to the application user, but the resolution may require action
on the part of some remote network operator. While low-level tools like
NetLogger (http:\/\/netlogger.lbl.gov\/) can help identify bottlenecks
that impact application level performance, it takes an expert in the
tool to interpret the results before stepscan be taken to eliminate
those bottlenecks.Therefore, it is essential that new technologies,
tools, and high-level services get developed and deployed to make it
easier for network operators to identify where performance problems
exist and to raise user expectations. Dealing with these complex issues
will require new multi-domain tools and services that provide authorized
 personnel access to performance and operations data along the entire
end-to-end application path. It should also be recognized that
individual users may need summary information to assist them in

real-time characterization of the bulk and the sizeresolved chemical
composition of ambient aerosols, particularly carbonaceous aerosols.
Such improved measurements would be used to facilitate the
identification of the origin of aerosols, (i.e., primary versus
secondary and fossil fuel versus biogenic). Also, these measurements
could help elucidate how the particles of an aerosol are processed in
the atmosphere by chemical reactions and by clouds, and how their
hygroscopic properties change as they age. This information is important
 because relatively little is known about organic and absorbing
particles, which are abundant in many locations in the atmosphere. In
particular, there is a need for instruments suitable for real-time
measurements of the composition of these particles at the molecular
level. Although recent advances have led to the development of new
instruments, such as particle mass spectrometers and single particle
analyzers, these instruments have important limitations in their ability
 to quantify black carbon vs. organic carbon, provide speciation of
refractory and volatile organic compounds, and calibrate both organic
and inorganic components.Furthermore, instruments that otherwise would
be suitable for ground-based operation often have limitations (size,
weight, power, stability, etc.) that restrict their application for in
situ measurements, where critical atmospheric processes actually occur
(e.g., in or near clouds).In order to better understand the chemical
composition of atmospheric aerosols, grant applications are sought to
develop improved instruments, or entirely new measurement methods, that

 carbon and other carbonaceous material, so that the makeup of the
absorbing fraction is known; (3) identification of source markers, such
as isotopicabundances in aerosols; and (4) the ability to probe the
chemical composition of aerosol surfaces. Proposed approaches that can
measure aerosol chemical composition from airborne platforms would be of
 particular interest.In order to address the deficiencies associated
with current techniques, proposed approaches should seek to provide: (1)
 quantifiable results over a wide range of compounds, which is a
deficiency of laser ablation aerosol mass spectrometer methods; (2)
measurements over a range of volatility so that dust, carbon, and salt
are detectable, which is a deficiency of thermal decomposition aerosol
mass spectrometers; and (3) measurements with high time resolution,
which is a deficiency of filter techniques.Questions \u2013 contact

VOCs and IVOCs partition primarily into the gas phase, they may react
with gaseous oxidants or with existing aerosol particles and droplets to
 form a secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass. Current methods for
predicting SOA production rates, based only on precursor organic
compounds that have been quantified (both VOCs and oxygenates),

that many gaseous organic compounds are not detected by commonly-used
techniques, such as gas chromatographic or chemical ionization-mass
spectrometric methods.Grant applications also are sought to develop
instruments to determine the total amount of carbon in these organic
compounds. The data provided by these instruments would allow scientific
 insights to be gained regarding the reason for the underestimation of
SOA production. (That is, is the underestimation due to key precursors
that are not measured? Or, is it due to the use of extrapolations \u2013

essential for describing both direct and indirect radiative forcing by
aerosols. However, current techniques fordetermining these distributions
 are often ambiguous because of the assumption that the particles are
spherical. In particular, the optical techniques most often used in the

applications are sought for techniques, which are not based on optical
properties, to determine the size distribution of ambient aerosols in
the 0.1 - 10 ?m size range. Proposed approaches must address the
influence of relative humidity and must be integrated with the
simultaneous measurement of such properties as mass concentration, area
(extinction), and particle number.Grant applications also are sought to
develop fast (~ 1 sec) and lightweight (suitable for sampling from
airborne platforms) instruments for (1) particle size spectrum
measurements in the 10- 600 nm size range, and (2) for cloud
droplet\/drizzle measurements (10\u20131000 ?m size range). Related
airborne measurements of great interest are (3) a fast spectrometer for

        "description": "Eighty-five percent of our nation's energy
results from the burning of fossil fuels from vast reservoirs of coal,
oil, and natural gas. These processes add carbon to the atmosphere,
principally in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2). It is important to
understand the fate of this excess CO2 in the global carbon cycle in
order to assess contemporary terrestrial carbon sinks, the sensitivity
of climate to atmospheric CO2, and future potentials for sequestration
of carbon in terrestrial systems. Therefore, improved measurement
approaches are needed to quantify the change of CO2 in atmospheric
components of the global carbon cycle, and to understand processes and
mechanisms of carbon sequestration of the terrestrial biosphere. There
is also interest in innovative approaches for flux and concentration
measurements of methane and other greenhouse gas constituents associated
 with terrestrial systems.The \u201cFirst State of the Carbon Cycle
Report (SOCCR)\u201d (Reference 1) provides rough estimates of
terrestrial carbon sinks for North America. A DOE working paper on
carbon sequestration science and technology (Reference 2) also describes
 research needs and technology requirements for sequestering carbon by
terrestrial systems. Both documents call for advanced sensor technology
and measurement approaches for detecting changes of atmospheric CO2
propertiesand of carbon quantities of terrestrial systems (including
biotic, microbial, and soil components). Such measurement technology
would improve the&amp;nbsp; quantification of CO2 , as well as carbon
stock and flux, in the major sinks identified by the SOCCR report (see
Figure ES.1 therein).Grant applications submitted to this topic should
(1) demonstrate performance characteristics of proposed measurement
systems, and (2) show a capability for deployment at field scales
ranging from experimental plot size (meters to hectares of land, with
comparable dimensions for marine systems) to nominal dimensions of
ecosystems (hectares to square kilometers). Phase I projects must
perform feasibility and\/or field tests of proposed measurement systems
to assure a high degree of reliability and robustness. Combinations of
stationary remote and in situ approaches will be considered, and
priority will be given to ideas\/approaches for verifying biosphere
carbon changes and for estimating carbon sequestration. Measurements
using aircraft or balloon platforms must be explicitly linked to
real-time ground-based measurements. Grant applications based on
satellite remote sensing platforms are beyond the scope of this topic,
and will be declined.",

carbon sequestration by natural vegetation and ecosystems (i.e., carbon
sinks) as well as CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from natural or
industrial sources. Grant applications are sought to develop sensors and
 unique measurement techniques (and associated system technology, if
appropriate) to detect and quantify annual net carbon changes of
terrestrial vegetation for large areas, or to measure and verify the
magnitude of CO2 emissions from various sources. Approaches of interest
include the development of sensors to measure fluxes between the
atmosphere and land-surface vegetation, new technology for accurate
measurement of soil carbon content and change, and the development of
miniaturized sensors to determine atmospheric CO2 concentration.For the
measurement of CO2 sinks, the sensor systems or new technology must be
applicable for forests, grasslands, shrub lands, agricultural lands,
and\/or wetlands, and have the capability of producing spatially
resolved aggregate estimates of terrestrial carbon changes to an
accuracy of 10 to 25 g\/m2\/yr (or approximately 0.25 tonnes of carbon
per hectare per year), with less than 25 percent uncertainty.For
measuring emissions or atmospheric concentrations, the apparatus must be
 located at a point remote from the actual site of CO2 release and
provide accuracy estimates for CO2 concentrations of approximately 0.3
ppm or less in dry air. Mechanical sensors must be durable in the full
range of normal environmental conditions and exposures, including
exposure to dust, rain, snow, heat, extreme cold, and fog. Operation in
unattended, remote locations for weeks at a time, without degradation of
 the measurement, is also required; however, daily telecommunication

operational problems would be desirable.Proposed approaches, including
both mechanical sensors and non-mechanical technology should consist of
new, innovative methodologies that are significant advances over
conventional scientific approaches used to measure CO2, carbon, and
methane within the atmospheric and terrestrial components of the global
carbon cycle. Specifically, the measurement systems should be different

Greenhouse Gas Constituents of Terrestrial and Atmospheric Media",

measurements of soil carbon\/organic matter \u2013 i.e., the carbon

of ecosystems, with an accuracy on the order of 10 grams per square
meter or less. Quantification of spatially resolved aggregate estimates
of terrestrial carbon changes should have an accuracy of 10 to 25
g\/m2\/yr (or approximately 0.25 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year),
 with less than 25 percent uncertainty.(2) Grant applications are sought
 to design and demonstrate a new CO2 analyzer that (a) can determine the
 mole fraction of CO2 in dry ambient air to a relative precision of 1
part in 3000 or better, in one minute or less; (b) operates with small
amounts of gas (30 cc\/min or less) to minimize problems due to water
vapor and to minimize consumption of reference gases, if employed; (c)
is robust enough for unattended field deployment for periods of half a
year orlonger; (d) costs less than $5000 when manufactured in quantity;
and (e) is not sensitive to motion.(3) Grant applications are sought to
develop lightweight sensors (approximately 100 grams) for measuring
atmospheric CO2. The sensors must be capable of measuring fluctuations
of CO2 in air of the order of plus or minus 1 ppm, in a background of
370 ppm. The devices must be suitable for launch on ballonsondes or
similar platforms, and therefore must be insensitive to large changes in
 ambient temperature and pressure. The devices also must be able to
operate on low power (e.g., 9v battery) and have a response time of less
 than 30 seconds.(4) Grant applications are sought to develop new
technology platforms that can be used to measure fluxes and\/or
concentrations of important trace greenhouse gas constituents, as well
as the isotopes of carbon, methane, CO, and other trace species.
Instrument designs should (a) place emphasis on determining the sources
and sinks of carbon, CO, and trace species, and (b) ensure long-term and
 robust field deployment. Grant applications dealing with the remote
measurement of vascular plant properties and processes will be
considered, provided that they meet the requirements described below.In
general, new technology for measuring terrestrial biota and soil must be
 accomplished by in situ and\/or non-invasive means, across a range of
temporal scales (from seconds to days) and spatial scales (from
millimeters to kilometers), depending on the system properties being
observed. The remote sensing of organic carbon is also of interest
\u2013 the term "remote sensing" means that the observation method is
physically separated from the object of interest. All instruments must
be portable and deployable in remote locations, and must not adversely
impact the site of deployment. Two other approaches are also of
interest: (1) the development of unique surface-based observations that
are used for the calibration\/interpretation of other remotely derived
data; and (2) potential applications of CO2 sensors via balloon sonde

(FEL), as well as the operation and upgrade of 3rd generation light
sources. Grant applications are sought to develop monitors for beam
position and electron bunch length. The beam position monitor should

storage ring applications. The electron beam bunch length monitor should
 perform non-destructive measurements, be capable of single-bunch
resolution better than 100 fs, and possess a system design that is
relevant for the bunch parameters of the future X-ray FEL and 3rd
generation light sources.Grant applications also are sought to develop
diagnostic devices for the non-destructive measurement of electron beam
emittance and for the energy spread within electron bunches. For FEL
applications, measurements of electron bunch properties require
resolution on the order of 10 ?m, so that the so-called
\u201cslice\u201d properties can be determined with sufficient accuracy.
 Boththe beam emittance and the energy spread of the beam are critical
parameters in FELs, and the measurement techniques must allow for rapid

systems for systems optimization. Approaches of interest include optical
 techniques that employ transition radiation or synchrotron radiation.
The diagnostics should be small (&amp;lt; 1 m length scale) and suitable

also are sought to develop diagnostics for the measurement of charge
modulation within an electron bunch at optical wavelengths in the regime
 50-1000 nm. Seeded FELs utilize an inverse FEL scheme to first
introduce an energy modulation into an electron bunch; then a dispersive
 transport region converts the energy modulation into a charge density
modulation along the electron bunch. The charge density is modulated
with the same period asthe laser, i.e., in the wavelength regime 50-1000
 nm.Grant applications are sought to develop a diagnostic technique for
the dynamic measurement of the transverse position of the centroid of an
 electron bunch, as a function of position along that bunch. The
transverse wakefields in a linac may introduce the so-called
\u201cbanana shape\u201d beam as a result of the beam-breakup
instability, in which deflecting wakefields introduce a transverse
spatial offset in the electron distribution along a bunch. Proposed
diagnostics must be able to measure this effect with spatial resolution
on the order of 1 ?m, and with temporal resolution (along the bunch) of
10-100 fs, in bunches of peak current 10-500 A.Finally, grant

damage erosion (CDE) in short-pulse liquid-mercury spallation targets.
CDE has the potential to limit the power capacity and lifetime of
targets. Damage has been observed inside test target vessels irradiated
with small numbers of intense proton beam pulses; also, this damage has
been studied at length in out-of-beam experiments that mimic the driving
 mechanism of cavitation. The damage is caused by intense and abrupt
pressure waves that are induced by the nearinstantaneous heating of the
mercury by the proton beam. Although certain surface hardening processes
 have shown promise in resisting damage, their potential to greatly
enhance power capacity is believed to be limited. Therefore, grant
applications are sought to develop:Small gas bubbles to reduce
beam-induced pressure. A population of small gas bubbles introduced in
the mercury could absorb and attenuate the beam-induced pressure
sufficiently to halt the driving mechanism for cavitation. The desired
bubble size is approximately 10 ?m in diameter and the required void
fraction approaches 1%. Grant applications are sought to develop: (1)
techniques for generating this population of bubbles in mercury; and (2)
 credible diagnostics to quantify the generated population.Protective
gas layers: Mercury, with its highly non-wetting characteristic and high
 surface tension is well suited to the formation and stabilization of
large gas pockets. Therefore, one promising option for damage mitigation
 involves the creation of an interstitial gas layer between the liquid
metal and the containment vessel wall.Innovative gas\/liquid flow
concepts for utilizing gas layers to protect pressure-vessel surfaces
from damage due to the cavitation of flowing mercury.&amp;nbsp;
Approaches of interest include: (1) the use of radiation-hard solid

structures that are not part of the pressure boundary; (2) extensive
surface modifications, such as grooves or cross-hatching to increase
surface area; or (3) other geometries designed to trap gas permanently
at the desired location. Because the most vulnerable pressure boundary
surfaces in the SNS target are vertical, proposed solutions must address
 the problem of blanketing (protecting) vertical surfaces, where the
hydrostatic gradient tends to force the gas to rise.Alternative and
innovative concepts for damage mitigation, aside from small gas bubbles

        "topic_name": "Undulator Radiation Sources",
        "description": "Advanced undulator radiation sources are
required for current and future light sources. Grant applications are
sought for the development of:(1) Superconducting undulators (SCUs) that
 can generate tunable, monochromatic x-ray beams in the 2-30 keV photon
energy range of medium-energy (2-3 GeV) synchrotrons. These requirements
 demand that the undulators have a short period (around 1.5 cm) and high
 peak magnetic fields (around 1.6 tesla). The permanent-magnets commonly
 used in undulators do not produce sufficiently high magnetic fields to
fully cover the desired photon energy range without gaps in the
spectrum. Development efforts are underway at several national
laboratories and in industry to develop SCUs that promise to overcome
these deficiencies. However, current designs suffer from an inability to
 operate without quenching in the presence of the heat induced by the
stored electron beam current and by synchrotron radiation encountered in
 modern synchrotron light sources. This heat load can be up to 10 watts
per meter of undulator length. Novel ideas for SCU design, construction,
 and thermal management are needed to meet these challenging
requirements.(2) Superconducting undulators with time varying fields.
This technology is in its infancy and could offer interesting
possibilities for insertion-device radiation sources(3)
Cryogenically-Cooled Permanent Magnet Undulators (CPMUs). When permanent
 magnet materials are cooled to low temperatures, they exhibit a large
coercivity (5-10%) for conventional materials, such as NdFeB or CoSm,
and up to 20% for more exotic materials. To make use of this effect,
undulators must be cooled to cryogenic temperatures, and, in the cooled
down stage, magnetic measurements and adjustments of the permanent
magnet must be performed. This requires a complex design.(4) High
coercivity permanent magnet materials for CPMUs. To take full advantage
of CPMUs, sintering and manufacturing procedures need to be developed
for permanent magnet material like PrFeB, which exhibits large increases
 in coercivity at cryogenic temperatures.(5) New superconducting
materials for undulator applications. Three types of materials promise a
 considerable enhancement of undulator performance: High temperature
superconducting materials such as YBCO, which operate at about 90K,
would allow current densities up 100kA\/mm2. The challenge here is to
optimize the conductor design to maximize the current density and the
transport current, leading to the development of coil manufacturing
techniques based on such materials (as the next step). Thin film high
temperature superconducting materials such as MgB2, which are operated
at ~39K, may become a good material for undulator magnets, depending
upon the choice of substrate material, which will determine the
mechanical properties of the&amp;nbsp; superconductor. The challenge
here is the production of thin films and the choice of optimum substrate
 materials. APC (artificially enhanced pinning center) NbTi
superconductor, which would allow super-high current densities that
exceed the Jc of conventional NbTi superconductor by a large factor (14
kA\/mm2 at 2 T). In particular, the high current density might offer an
advantage for the design of magnet coils for undulator magnets.(6)
Undulators with period &amp;lt; 1 cm. The resonant condition requires
undulator radiation at short wavelength (approximately 1 nm), with low
energy electron beams (of 1-2 GeV), and with a shorter period than
generally available from existing synchrotron radiation sources. The
undulators should be designed with K-value ~1, impedance shielding of
pole faces, and a gap that is greater than 2.25 mm.Questions \u2013

holders\/cells (including electrochemical and photoelectrochemical
cells), and controller\/software support for ultrafast, environmental

purify products in virtually every industrial process. Pervasive
throughout industrial operations, conventional separation processes are
energy intensive and costly. Separation processes represent 40 to 70
percent of both capital and operating costs in industry. They also
account for 45 percent of all the process energy used by the chemical
and petroleum refining industries every year. Industrial efforts to
increase costcompetitiveness, boost energy efficiency, increase
productivity, and prevent pollution demand more efficient separation
processes. In response to these needs, the Department of Energy supports
 the development of high-risk, innovative separation technologies. In
particular, membrane technology offers a viable alternative to
conventional energy intensive separations.Successful membrane
applications today include producing oxygen-enriched air for combustion,
 recovering and recycling hot wastewater, volatile organic carbon
recovery, and hydrogen purification. Membranes have also been combined
with conventional techniques such as distillation to deliver improved
product purity at a reduced cost. Membrane separations promise to yield
substantial economic, energy, and environmental benefits leading to
enhanced competitiveness by reducing annual energy consumption,
increasing capital productivity, and reducing waste streams and
pollution abatement costs.Despite the successes and advancements, many
challenges must be overcome before membrane technology becomes more
widely adapted. Technical barriers include fouling, instability, low
flux, low separation factors, and poor durability. Advancements are
needed that will lead to new generations of organic, inorganic, and
ceramic membranes. These membranes require greater thermal and chemical
stability, greater reliability, improved fouling and corrosion
resistance, and higher selectivity. The objective is better performance
in existing industrial applications, as well as opportunities for new
applications. To advance the use of membrane separations, research is
needed to develop new, more effective membrane materials and innovative
ways to incorporatemembranes in industrial processes. Grant applications
 must address the potential public benefits that the proposed technology
 would provide, both from reduced energy consumption and from the
reduction in one or more of the following: materials consumption, water
consumption, and toxic and pollutants dispersion. Grant applications

 using ceramic or metal membrane materials), and (3) suitability for

Particular processes\/systems of interest include membranes for the
separation of biobased products, membranes for hydrogen separation and
purification, membranes for CO2 capture, and membranes for industrial
applications.For industrial applications, high temperature separations
of hydrocarbons and other mixtures are of particular interest. For
example, low molecular weight hydrocarbons are separated from natural
gas by condensing them as a liquid, and the liquid is distilled to
fractionate it, or the liquid is hydrocracked to olefins. However,
chilling the natural gas in order to recover the condensable portion and
 then reheating it is inefficient, because the energy used to chill it
cannot be recovered. Membranes, either as standalone systems or
hybridized with other separation technologies, may provide an energy
efficient means of separating mixtures at the high temperatures at which
 these industrial processes are carried out.For all membrane

        "description": "This subtopic solicits innovation research for
the development of membrane technology to reduce distillation energy in
petroleum refinery and petrochemical separation processes. Large-scale
industrial distillation accounts for about one-sixth of the annual
energy consumed by the petroleum and petrochemical process industries,
making it the single most energy intensive process of all US industrial
processing. Since the energy savings potential for reducing distillation
 is so large considerable R&amp;amp;D for membrane technologies with
potential applications in the petrochemical process industries has
already been invested; nevertheless, membrane technologies have so far
contributed marginally to distillation energy reduction in commercial
application.. Cost&amp;nbsp; considerations have been the barrier to
industrial hydrocarbon separations assisted by membranes. Grant
applications for innovation research in membrane technology development
for petroleum and natural gas liquid hydrocarbon separations are
solicited that will reduce distillation process energy in any of the
hydrocarbon separation process steps. The application must address
aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon separations alone, and thus Phase 1
grant applications for innovation research in oxygenated or other
chemical product membrane separations are not responsive to this
subtopic solicitation. By far the most important aspect of this subtopic
 solicitation is the understanding of R&amp;amp;D that has already been
invested in membrane technologies for hydrocarbon separations, and an
understanding of the barriers to the development and commercialization
of those membrane technologies. Thus thorough patent andliterature
searches are imperative to the preparation of responsive applications to
 the subtopic, and for this and for the promise of eventual
commercialization of successful new technologies the partnerships of
small technology business and US industrial companies are strongly
encouraged.Questions - contact Charles Russomanno,

        "description": "Grant applications are sought to enhance the
separation capabilities of membranes used in industrial process streams.
 Proposed research should be aimed at developing and commercializing
innovative membrane systems, using new or currently existing membranes,
that can be robust when integrated within real-world processes (e.g.,
inert gas removal, isomer separation, aromatic\/non-aromatic
separations, sulfur removal, CO2 capture, and removal of trace metals).
Grant applications should seek to address one or more of the following
needs: (1) techniques for overcoming scale-up problems related to
contaminants in industrial streams (fouling, oil misting, etc.), (2)
manufacturing technologies that would reduce the cost of membrane
modules, (3) anti-fouling and anti-flux schemes to improve the long-term
 operability of membrane systems, and (4) methods to regenerate membrane
 performance and lower membrane maintenance costs. Also of interest is
the integration of membranes with other technologies (such as the
integration of membranes with distillation systems, or with adsorption
or extraction processes), in order to address specific process issues.
For all grant applications, the overriding goal is to enhance U.S.
industrial process efficiency to the maximum possible extent by
increasing the separation process efficiency. Therefore, priority will
be given to applications that carefully examine the efficiency of the
proposed membrane technology within the targeted application. Grant
applications should also include a process evaluation and an economic
analysis along with the R&amp;amp;D effort. Lastly, technology
partnerships involving U.S. manufacturers, suppliers, and end users are
strongly encouraged.Questions - contact Charles Russomanno,

 Glass",
        "description": "High temperature (650\u00b0C to 850\u00b0C)
planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks are comprised of alternating
fuel and air chambers, which are sealed from each other and connected to
 fuel and air delivery manifolds, respectively. These seals are subject
to a demanding set of performance criteria due to the extreme operating
environment. The seals must have a low electrical conductivity, be
chemically and mechanically stable in a high temperature reactive
environment (moist reducing and\/or oxidizing conditions), and
demonstrate chemical compatibility with the cell and interconnect
materials of the particular cell\/stack design. Grant applications are
sought to develop viscous glass-based sealing concepts for SOFCs.
Ideally, the viscous glasses would maintain a softening temperature at
or slightly below the lower bounds of the SOFC operating temperature
(650\u00b0C) and retain suitable viscosity to the upper bound
(850\u00baC), over the life of the seal, and be resistant to
devitrification within the SOFC environment. Given that such a glass on
its own may be unable to withstand the differential pressure across the
seal (up to 2 psid) or the stack bearing load, it is envisioned that an
engineered composite solution will be required to carry bearing loads
and retain the viscous sealing material. The ultimate objective is the
development of an economically-viable, manufacturable seal material
followed by a composite system design that can provide sealing under all
 operating conditions for the life of planar SOFC stacks.For reference
purposes, the sealed perimeter for a single fuel cell-interconnect
repeat unit seal is approximately 100cm. Approaches of interest should
meet the following performance criteria: (1) volatile constituents in
the seal should be minimized to less than 1% weight loss over 40,000
hours; (2) fuel leakage should be less than 1%, averaged over the seal
area and not catastrophic for the duration of the seal life; and (3) the
 seal material must be capable of a service life of more than 40,000
hours and dozens of thermal cycles for stationary systems.Phase I should
 focus on the identification of candidate viscous glasses and conduct
rigorous analysis and experimentation to characterize crystallization,
volatility, reactivity, wetting, and viscosity in the SOFC environment.
Phase II would entail composite seal design and experimental validation,
 culminating in larger-scale testing, potentially in partnership with
other SECA R&amp;amp;D efforts or one or more SECA Industry
Teams.Questions \u2013 contact Briggs White, Briggs.White@netl.doe.gov",

        "description": "The projected doubling of world energy
consumption within the next 50 years, along with resource constraints
and environmental concerns about using fossil fuels , have spurred great
 interest in generating electrical energy from renewable sources such as
 wind and solar. The variable and stochastic nature of renewable
sources, however, makes solar and wind power difficult to manage,
especially at high levels of penetration. To effectively use the
intermittent renewable energy and enable its delivery demand electrical
energy storage (EES). For example, storage operating near an
intermittent, renewable wind energy source can smooth out wind
variability, lessen the slope on ramp rates, and, at sufficient scale,
can store off peak wind energy. EES is also an effective tool to improve
 the reliability, stability, and efficiency of the future electrical
grid, i.e. smart grid that enables real-time, two-way communication to
balance demand and generation and supports plug-in electrical vehicles.
Electrical energy storage can shave peaks from a user or utility load
profile, increase asset utilization by improving duty factor and
delaying utility upgrades, decrease fossil fuel use for ancillary
services, provide high levels of power quality, and increase grid
stability. Distributed energy storage near load centers can reduce
congestion on both the distribution and transmission systems.Among the
most promising electrical storage technologies are redox flow batteries
(RFBs) and sodium (Na) batteries. RFBs have the advantage of allowing
separationof power and energy. The power (kW) of the system is
determined by the size of the electrodes and the number of cells in a
stack, whereas the energy storage capacity (kWh) by the concentration
and volume of the electrolyte. Varied RFBs have been developed,
including the all vanadium redox flow batteries (VRBs) that have
recently demonstrated operation at multi-MWs with unlimited cycle life.
The use of abundant, low cost Na makes the Na-batteries attractive to
further cost reduction for the grid applications. Sodium batteries
typically come with either a polysulfide or metal halide cathode. Both
deliver good performance but at high capital and levelized costs
(&amp;gt;$3,000\/kW and &amp;gt;30\u00a2\/kWh, respectively). One of the
 major cost drivers for sodium batteries is the solid-state electrolyte
membrane, while for VRBs the cost is attributed to the electrolyte.
Finally, the ultimate in low-cost, high energy density energy storage
are the metal-air systems, which have been demonstrated in the
laboratory but suffer from drastically limited cycle life and low
efficiency at the discharge and recharge cathode
half-reactions.Particularly sought this year are research efforts
related to novel, high performance and low-cost electrolytes in RFBs,
high conductivity solid-state electrolyte membranes either for sodium or
 for other abundantly available lightweight multivalent cation systems
(e.g., aluminum or magnesium), and technologies with promise to extend
the life of metal-air cathodes to thousands of cycles at low cost and
high cycle efficiencies.",

 high cost comes from vanadium andpreparation of high purity of the

loosely-packed layers that allows for facile transport of Na+ in
elevated temperatures. For a satisfactory performance, the Na-batteries
are built upon a thick solid electrolyte (?1.0 mm) and operated at
300-350oC. The solid oxide membranes are prepared via sophisticated
ceramic processing, including extruding\/casting and varied stages of
heating or sintering. Alternatively NaSICON has been reported lately for
 Na-batteries that can operate at lower temperatures than that required
for NSBs and NMBs. There however remain challenges for this type of
membranes in conductivity, long term stability, etc. In addition to
sodium, other membrane chemistries are of interest to enable the usage
of other low-cost, multivalent materials (magnesium or aluminum as
examples) that would increase energy density and improve cost.
Lithium-based chemistries are specifically discouraged from this call.
Applications are sought to develop low cost, robust solid state
membranes that can allow for satisfactory operation of Naand other
multivalent cation-based batteries at temperatures &amp;lt;250oC. An
ideal membrane should exhibit: 1) high cation conductivity, 2) excellent
 structural and mechanical stability, 3) good chemical stability to
adjacent components during operation at elevated temperatures, and 4)
low cost in raw materials and manufacturing.Questions \u2013 contact

        "description": "Metal-air chemistry has the highest theoretical
energy density due to the use of an inexhaustible supply of low-cost O2
discharging 4 electrons per molecule as a cathode. For example,
lithium-air yields 13 kWh\/kg versus the anemic 0.42 kWh\/kg for
lithium-ion[6], highlighting the tremendous advantage in energy density
of metal-air over existing technology, and important for reducing the
overall cost of large scale stationary storage. Historically, technical
limiting factors that vary based on the chosen anode
material-electrolyte system have prevented the realization of a specific
 rechargeable chemistry. Current technology is limited by the high
overpotentials of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and its reverse
reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), poor cycle life, and high
 cost of electrodes using platinum electrocatalysts. Applications are
sought to develop a rechargeable oxygen cathode for a chosen battery
chemistry that (1) is electrically efficient (roundtrip efficiency

producing fusion devices will experience 5-15 MW\/m2 surface heat flux
under normal operation (steadystate)and off-normal energy deposition up
to 1 MJ\/m2 within 0.1 to 1.0 ms. Refractory solid surfaces represent
one type of PFC option. These PFCs are envisioned to have a refractory
metal heat sink, cooled by helium gas, and a plasma facing surface,
consisting of an engineered refractory metal surface or a thin coating
of refractory material that minimizes thermal stresses. The materials
being considered include tungsten and molybdenum alloys. Grant
applications are sought to develop: (1) innovative refractory alloys
having good thermal conductivity (similar to Mo, at a minimum),
resistance to recrystallization and grain growth, good mechanical
properties (e.g., strength and ductility), and resistance to thermal
fatigue; (2) coatings or specialized low-Z surface treatments of
refractory alloy armor for improved plasma performance; (3) innovative
refractory-metal heat sink designs for enhanced helium gas cooling; (4)
efficient fabrication methods for engineered surfaces that mitigate the
stresses due to high heat flux; and (5) joining methods, for attaching
the plasma facing material to the heat sink, that are reliable,
efficient to manufacture, and capable of high heat transfer \u2013 these
 new joining techniques may be applicable to either advanced,
helium-cooled, refractory heat sinks or present-day, water-cooled,
copperalloy heat sinks.In addition, grant applications are sought to
develop new or improved in situ diagnostic techniques to monitor the
health and performance of operating PFCs and plasma edge conditions. A
carefully selected combination of microelectromechanical (MEMS)-like,
robust diagnostics could create an instrumented PFC that monitors
important characteristics (such as the temperature and stress gradients)
 within the PFC or provides real-time information on erosion\/deposition
 rates or tritium uptake during operation. Measurements of current,
B-field, plasma edge temperature and density, spectral emissions, and
heat flux also would be of interest. Such diagnostics must be an
integral part of the PFC, be self-powered, operate at elevated
temperatures in the presence of high magnetic fields and neutron
fluence, be immune to RF noise, provide for wireless data transmission
with high signal to noise ratio, and be compatible with high performance
 plasma operation.Another PFC option is to use a flowing liquid metal
surface as a plasma facing component, an approach which will require the
 production and control of thin, fast flowing, renewable films of liquid
 lithium, gallium, or tin for particle control at divertors. Grant
applications are sought to develop: (1) techniques for the production,
control, and removal of flowing (velocity 0.01 to 10 m\/s) liquid metal
films (0.5-5 mm thick) over a temperature controlled substrate; (2)
advances in materials that are wet by liquid metals at temperatures near
 the respective metal melting point and that are conducive to the
production of uniform well-adhered films; (3) techniques for active
control of liquid metal flow and stabilization in the presence of plasma
 instabilities (time and space varying magnetic field); and (4)
computational tools that model the flow and magnetohydrodynamic response
 of flowing liquid metals.Grant applications also are sought to develop

modeling surface material properties and\/or plasma
surface\/interactions, for the purpose designing and assessing PFC
surface materials. Finally grant applications are sought to develop

        "topic_name": "Blanket Materials and Systems",
        "description": "Blanket systems including an integrated first
wall facing the plasma are complex, multi-function, multi-material
components that capture neutrons emitted from the burning plasma to both
 produce tritium via nuclear reactions with lithium, and extract the
energy for efficient power conversion. Associated with the blanket are
coolant and tritium processing systems, all of which have scientific and
 technological issues in need of resolution. Proposals that address
these issues in areas such as:thermofluid and thermomechanical
simulation of coolant flows and structural responses under surface and
volumetric heat loads;mass transport (corrosion and tritium) modeling
development and simulations;ceramic breeder and beryllium pebbles
material fabrication, characterization, and thermomechanics;SiC or
alternate insulators for electric current and thermal heat;tritium
permeation barriers and permeator windows, corrosion barriers,
etc.;chemistry and impurity control in coolants (helium, liquid metals,
etc.);Flow and other diagnostic sensors compatible with fusion
environment; or any blanket and tritium system relevant development
issue.Several areas of particular interest are described in more detail
below.There is a strong need to understand and predict in greater detail
 both the corrosion, transport and redoposition of materials, and the
generation, bubble formation, transport and permeation of tritium in the
 fusion relevant coolant and breeder material Pb-15.7Li alloy. Both
numerical predictive tools and increased database from experimental
studies are needed to better characterize the corrosion and tritium
transport behavior in Pb-Li alloy under fusion relevant conditions that
include operation at 400-700C and the presences of strong magnetic
fields in contact with various materials such as ferritic steels,
silicon-carbide, and other proposed tritium or corrosion barrier or
permeator materials for tritium extraction.The pebble-bed solid breeder
configuration introduces several operational limits: thermomechanical
uncertainties caused by pebble-bed wall interaction, potential sintering
 and subsequent macro-cracking, and a low pebble-bed thermal
conductivity \u2013 all of which result in small characteristic bed
dimensions and limit windows of operation. A new form of solid breeder
morphology is required that holds the promise for increased breeding
ratios \u2013 dictated by increased breeder material density; long term
structural reliability; and enhanced operational control \u2013 compared
 to packed beds. Grant applications are sought for new solid breeder
material concepts that include: (1) increased breeder material densities
 (~80%); (2) higher thermal conductivities (provided by a fully
interconnected structure, as opposed to point contacts between pebbles);
 (3) better thermal contact, such as reliable bonded contact, with
cooling structures (instead of point contacts between pebbles and wall);
 (4) the absence of major geometry changes between beginning-of-life and
 end-of life (such as sintering in pebble beds) in the presence of high
neutron fluence; and (5) structural integrity in freestanding and
selfsupporting structures with significant thermo-mechanical
flexibility.Flow channel inserts (FCIs) act as magnetohydrodynamic and
thermal insulators in ferritic steel channels containing, for example, a
 slowly flowing tritium breeder such as molten Pb-15.7Li alloy. The
insert geometry is approximately box-channel-shaped in straight
channels, with more complex shapes possible, for insertion in manifolds
and other complex-geometry elements in the flow path. Although SiC\/SiC
composite is a candidate FCI material, its use would differ from its
potential application as a structural material in that high thermal and
electrical conductivity would not be desirable. In fact, the electrical
conductivity should be low, with a target maximum around 1 to 50 ?-1m-1.
 In addition, the strength requirements for a SiC\/SiC FCI are reduced
compared to the composite\u2019s application as a structural material,
because the primary stresses and pressure loads will be very low. On the
 other hand, the insert must be able to withstand thermal stresses from
through-surface temperature differences in the range of 150-300K, over a
 thickness of 3 to 15 mm depending on designs. Grant applications are
sought to develop manufacturing techniques for radiation resistant, low
thermal\/electrical conductivity SiC\/SiC composites or other suitable,
compatible materials that would make for effective FCIs. One approach
that has been envisioned is the use of a final \u201csealing\u201d layer
 of SiC matrix material, which would be near theoretical density and
cover any porosity or exposed fibers in the main body of the insert.
Two-dimensional weaves are also thought to be satisfactory, as well as
an effective way to reduce electrical conductivity normal to the
interface between the insert and the Pb-15.7Li (the more important of
the directions). In addition, grant applications are sought to develop
experimental techniques for determining: (1) the compatibility between
the SiC\/SiC composite and such breeder materials as Pb-15.7Li alloy,
and (2) the insert integrity under cyclic thermal loading and other
in-service conditions.One of the missions of the ITER project is the
integrated testing of fusion blanket modules in a true integrated fusion
 environment. This ITER fusion&amp;nbsp; environment includes radiation
and magnetic fields, along with surface and volumetric heating, under
pulsed and\/or steady-state plasma operation. The testing of first
wall\/blanket components will be performed in ITER by inserting
\u201ctest blanket modules\u201d (TBMs) that will be complicated systems
 of different functional materials (breeder, multiplier, coolant,
structure, insulator, etc.) in various configurations with many
responses and interacting phenomena (e.g., thermomechanical,
thermofluid, nuclear). As part of the design and validation process an
overall simulation of a \u201cvirtual\u201d TBM, integrating all of the
individual computational modeling simulations at the system level, is
essential to define meaningful experiments. Such a simulation would be
inherently multi-scale and multi-physics and will require careful code
and algorithm design. Therefore, grant applications are sought to
develop a TBM and general power reactor relevant simulation code that
can provide detailed predictions of: (1) fluid flow and thermal
hydraulic characteristics; (2) the thermal response of all materials
(structure, breeder, multiplier, coolant, insulator, etc); (3)
structural responses such as stress and deformation magnitudes with
respect to different loadings, including both steadystate surface heat
flux and dynamic loadings; (4) mass transfer characteristics including
both corrosion and tritium transport phenomena, and (5) other important
performance characteristics of the TBM or blanket system. The overall
code framework\/structure must effectively link all of the simulation
components of the virtual TBM and serve as an efficient, useful, and
user-friendly tool that is extendable from ITER to demonstration power
reactor conditions.Questions \u2013 contact Ed Stevens,

capable of improving the efficiency and power handling capability of the
 transmission lines, in order to reduce losses and protect the system
from overheating, arcing, damage or failure during the required long
pulse operation (~3000s). Examples of components needed for the ECRH
transmission line include high power loads, low loss miter bends,
polarizers, power samplers, windows, switches, and dielectric breaks.
For the ITER transmission lines, improved techniques are needed for the
mass production of components, in order to reduce cost. Lastly, advanced
 computer codes are needed to simulate the microwave, thermal, and
mechanical components of the transmission lines. Components needed for

        "description": "The realistic simulation of fusion plasmas is
important for the design and evaluation of plasma discharge feedback and
 control systems; the design, operation, and performance assessment of
existing and proposed fusion experiments; the planning of experiments on
 existing devices; and the interpretation of the experimental data
obtained from these experiments. The simulation of fusion plasmas is
very challenging because (1) the range of temporal and spatial scales
involved is enormous and these scales often overlap, violating the
assumption of scale separation; and (2) the nonlinear physical processes
 that govern the behavior of these plasmas are strongly coupled in the
regimes of interest for fusion energy production. Although, in recent
years, considerable progress has been made toward the understanding of
these processes \u2013 including particle, momentum, and energytransport
 driven by plasma turbulence, macroscopic equilibrium and stability,
wave-plasma interactions, energetic particle physics, and the behavior
of the edge plasma \u2013 there remains a critical need to integrate the
 various plasma models, in order to develop an integrated predictive
simulation capability for magnetically confined plasmas. In addition,
efficient computational tools are needed to manage, analyze, and
visualize the enormous datasets resulting from large scale fusion
simulations and experiments.Grant applications are sought to develop
computer algorithms and tools that are applicable to simulations of
magnetically confined plasmas, incorporate an expanded number of plasma
features, and integrate multiple physical processes across multiple
spatial and temporal scales. Areas of interest include, but are not
limited to: (1) algorithms incorporating advanced mathematical
techniques; (2) algorithms targeting novel computing architectures,
including GPUand hybrid computing; ; (3) verification and validation
tools, including efficient methods for facilitating comparison of
simulation results with experimental data and the development of
synthetic diagnostics; (4) data management, visualization, and analysis
tools for local and remote multi-dimensional time-dependent datasets
resulting from large scale simulations or experiments; (5) techniques
for coupling simulation codes, including coupling across different
computer platforms and through high speed networks; (6) methodologies
for building highly configurable and modular scientific codes and
flexible data interfaces; and (7) remote collaboration tools that
enhance the ability of geographically distributed groups of scientists
to interact in real-time.The simulation and data analysis tools should
be developed using modern software techniques, should be capable of
exploiting the potential of next&amp;nbsp; generation high performance

is becoming competitive with magnetic tape for storing large volumes of

current technology keeps all disk drives powered and spinning, the
infrastructure costs of operating a many-petabyte-scale disk storage
system can be significant. However, one characteristic of nuclear

Therefore, grant applications are sought for new techniques for

infrequent data access, emphasizing lower cost, lower power usage, and
low access latency to frequently used data. To the extent feasible, it
is desirable that the cost should scale with the amount of data accessed
 rather than the total storage capacity.\nAlso, many DOE labs have
existing investments in large-scale tape robot technologies, which are
at this point the most cost-effective way to store petabyte-sized
datasets. Grant applications are sought for (1) the development of
innovative storage technologies that not only can use existing cartridge
 and tape formats but also will significantly increase the storage
density and capacity, increase data read and write speeds, or decrease

volume of data now being generated in these facilities has reached the
point at which bit error rates in hardware are no longer low enough to

systems potentially spanning disk and tape storage systems are needed

Acquisition",
        "description": "Modern data acquisition systems are becoming
more heterogenous and distributed. This presents new challenges in
synchronization of the different elements of this event-driven
architecture. The building blocks of the data acquisition system are
digitizers, either flash digitizers or integrating digitizers of time,
pulse height or charge. These elements respond in real-time to convert
electrical signals from detectors into digital form. The data from each
detector element is labeled with a precisely synchronized time and
transmitted to buffers. The total charge, the number of coincident
elements or other information summaries are used to determine if
something interesting has happened, that is, forming a trigger. If the
trigger justifies it, the data from the elements are assembled together
into a time-correlated event for later analysis, a process called Event
Building. At present the elements tend to be connected by buses (VME,
cPCI), custom interconnects or serial connections (USB).\nA concept of
the next generation data acquisition system is that it will be
ultimately composed of separate ADC's for each detector element,
connected by commercial network or serial technology, is envisioned.
Development is required to implement the elements of this distributed
data acquisition over commercially available network technologies such
as 10 Gb Ethernet or Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture
(ATC). The initial work needed is to develop a software architecture for
 a system that works efficiently in the available network bandwidth and
latencies. The elements desired in the architecture are to (1)
synchronize time to a sufficient precision, as good as 10ns or better to
 support Flash Analog-to-Digital Converter (FADC) clock synchronization,
 100ns or better to support trigger formation and event building, (2)
determine a global trigger from information transmitted by the
individual components (3) notify the elements of a successful trigger,
in order to locally store the current information, (4) collect event
data from the individual elements to be assembled into events and (5)
software tools to validate the function of the synchronization,
triggering and event building during normal operation. The
synchronization of time is critical to the success of this architecture,
 as is the constant validation of the synchronization.\nThe software
architecture would specify a functional model for the individual
elements of the system, the high level network protocols, and
requirements on the communications fabric for given data rates and
system latencies. In certain types of experiments at FRIB, low event
rates of 1 to 10 kevents\/s are anticipated, with large data streams
from FADC-based detector systems. The large latencies possible in highly
 buffered flash ADC architectures can be used to advantage in the design
 of the architecture. A portable software implementation of the elements
 would be the next step in the development.\nSuch an architecture and
its implementation could form the basis of a standard for next
generation data acquisition in nuclear physics, particularly at the
FRIB. Interested parties should contact Dr. Robert Varner at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory (varnerrl@ornl.gov).\nQuestions - contact Manouchehr

        "description": "Active Pixel Sensors in CMOS (complementary
metal-oxide semiconductor) technology are replacing Charge Coupled
Devices as imaging devices and cameras for visible light. Several
laboratories are exploring the possibility of using such devices as
direct conversion particle detectors. The charge produced by an ionizing
 particle in the epitaxial layer is collected by diffusion on a sensing
electrode in each pixel. The charge is amplified by a relatively-simple
low-noise circuit in each pixel and read out in a matrix arrangement. If
 successful, this approach would make possible high-resolution,
positionsensitive particle detectors with very low mass (approximately
50 microns of silicon in a single layer). This approach would be
superior to the present technology that uses a separate silicon detector
 layer, which is bump-bonded to a CMOS readout circuit. Grant
applications are sought to advance the development of integrated
detector-electronics technology, using CMOS monolithic circuits as
particle detectors. The new active pixel detector with its integrated
electronic readout should be based on a standard CMOS process. The
challenge is to design a sensor with low noise readout circuits that
have sufficiently high sensitivity and low power dissipation, in order
to detect a minimum ionizing particle in a thin
\u201cepitaxial-like\u201d or equivalent layer (~10-30 microns).\nGrant
applications also are sought for the next generation of active pixel
sensors, or even strip sensors, which use the bulk silicon substrate as
the active volume. This more advanced approach would have the advantage
of developing relatively larger signals and allowing sensitivity to
nonminimum ionizing particles, such as MeV-range gamma rays.\nQuestions -

Techniques",
        "description": "Grant applications are sought to develop (1)
manufacturing techniques for large, thin, multiple-layer printed circuit
 boards (PCBs) with plated-through holes, dimensions from 2m x 2m to 5m x
 5m, and thicknesses from 100 to 200 microns (these PCBs would have use
in cathode pad chambers, cathode strip chambers, time projection chamber
 cathode boards, etc); (2) techniques to add plated-through holes, in a
reliable robust way, to large rolls of metallized mylar or kapton (which
 would have applications in detectors such as time expansion chambers or
 large cathode strip chambers); and (3) miniaturization techniques for
connectors and cables with 5 times to 10 times the density of standard
interdensity connectors.\nIn addition, many next-generation detectors
will have highly segmented electrode geometries with 5-5000 channels per
 square centimeter, covering areas up to several square meters.
Conventional packaging and assembly technology cannot be used at these
high densities. Grant applications are sought to develop (1) advanced
microchip module interconnect technologies that address the issues of
high-density area-array connections \u2013 including modularity,
reliability, repair\/rework, and electrical parasitics; (2) technology
for aggregating and transporting the signals (analog and digital)
generated by the front-end electronics, and for distributing and
conditioning power and common signals (clock, reset, etc.); (3) low-cost
 methods for efficient cooling of on-detector electronics; (4) low-cost
and low-mass methods for grounding and shielding; and (5) standards for
interconnecting ASICs (which may have been developed by diverse groups
in different organizations) into a single system for a given experiment
\u2013 these standards should address the combination of different
technologies, which utilize different voltage levels and signal types,
with the goal of reusing the developed circuits in future
experiments.\nLastly, highly-segmented detectors with pixels smaller
than 100 microns present a significant challenge for integration with
frontend electronics. New monolithic techniques based on vertical
integration and through-silicon vias have potential advantages over the
current bump-bonded approach. Grant applications are sought to
demonstrate reliable, readily-manufacturable technologies to
interconnect silicon pixel detectors with CMOS front-end integrated
circuits. Of highest long term interest are high-density
high-functionality 3D circuits with direct bonding of high resistivity
silicon detector layer of an appropriate thickness (50 to 500 microns)
to a 3D stack of thin CMOS layers. The high resistivity detector layer
would be fully depleted to enable fast charge collection with very low
diffusion. The thickness of this layer would be optimized for the photon
 energy of interest or to obtain sufficient signal from minimum ionizing
 particles.\nQuestions - contact Manouchehr Farkhondeh,

multiple anode photomultiplier tubes, silicon-based photomultipliers,
high-intensity (~1020 ?\/s) gammaray current-readout detectors (e.g.,
Compton Diodes), photodiodes for operation at liquid helium temperatures
 with a signal-to-noise ratio comparable to a photomultiplier tube,

Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) or cells with
paramagnetic atoms that employ large pickup loops to surround the
sample).\nWith respect to particle identification detectors, grant

 that saturation effects change the field characteristics as a function
of induction. However, without iron, the stray fields are very often
unacceptably high. For superconducting solenoids this problem can be
solved by active shielding. The development of magnet systems with
tilted crossed solenoid windings and active shielding could provide a
solution for a broad variety of ironless superconducting dipoles, which,

charged-particle tracking detector systems, such as drift chambers, pad

 vacuum seals for application in high-radiation environment: Vacuum
rotary feedthroughs for high rotational speeds, which have a long
lifetime under a high-radiation environment, are highly desirable for
the realization of rotating targets and beam dumps for rare isotope beam
 production and beam strippers in high-power heavy-ion accelerators.
Interested parties should contact Dr. Wolfgang Mittig, NSCL\/MSU

due to radiation damage in the high-radiation environment found in the
target facility of FRIB and other high-power target facilities.
Alternative solutions that provide extended lifetimes and are suitable
for remote-handling applications are needed. Interest parties should
contact Tom Burgess, NSTD\/ORNL (burgesstw@ornl.gov).\n(3) Radiation
resistant magnetic field probes based on new technologies: An issue in
all highpower target facilities and accelerators is the limited lifetime
 of conventional nuclear magnetic resonance probes in high-radiation

probes (possibly based on new techniques like ion traps) for 0.2-5 Tesla

fields. Radiation transport studies are needed to design and operate
facilities efficiently and safely. Further improvements to radiation
transport codes and models of secondary radiation production, shielding,
 and heat deposition \u2013 along with their validation against
experimental data \u2013 are necessary. Heavy ion transport calculations
 in general take significantly longer computational time than for light
ion transport. Therefore, improvements in calculation efficiencies are
needed. Currently available heavy ion transport codes do not account for
 the production and intensity of the ions, or for changes in
charge-state distributions as the ions pass through matter or magnetic
fields. The development and incorporation of charge-state distribution
models into radiation transport codes would enhance both the design of
beam stripping and beam absorption components and the safety and
lifetime consequences of produced radiation fields. Interested parties
should contact Dr. Reg Ronningen, NSCL\/MSU

with heavy ions: The use of energetic and highpower heavy ion beams at
future research facilities will create significant levels of radiation
damage to facility components, thus limiting their useful lifetimes.
Sparse experimental data taken at low energies indicate that the
radiation damage caused by heavy ions may be orders of magnitude higher
than that predicted by existing models, such as those currently
implemented in radiation transport codes. It is purported that phenomena
 such as the Swift Heavy Ion effect, which are not accounted for, may be
 important. New and\/or improved models are needed to reliably estimate
the effects of radiation damage by heavy ions, in order to better design

        "topic_name": "Improved Radiochemical Separation Methods for
Preparing High-Purity Radioisotopes",
        "description": "Separation of isotopes from contaminants and
bulk material and the purification of the isotope to customer
specifications is a critical process in the production cycle of an
isotope. Traditional strategies and techniques rely on old technologies
and still require an extensive workforce to operate specialized
equipment, such as manipulators for remote handling in hot cell
environments. Conventional separation methods may include liquid-liquid
extraction, column extraction, distillation or precipitation and are
used to separate radioactive and nonradioactive trace metals from target
 materials, lanthanides, alkaline and alkaline earth metals, halogens,
or organic materials. High-purity isotope products are essential for
high-yield protein radiolabeling, for radiopharmaceutical use, or to
replace materials with undesirable radioactive emissions. Improved
radiochemical separation methods can be achieved and costs of isotope
production can be reduced by a) improvements in separations chemistry
methods, and b) implementing automated systems and robotics. Of
particular interest are developments that automate routine separation
processes in order to reduce operator labor hours and worker radiation
dose, including semi-automation modules for separations or automated,
microprocessor controlled systems for elution, radiolabeling,
purification, and dispensing. Such automated assemblies should be easily
 adaptable to different processes and hot cell use at multiple sites,
including the DOE laboratories currently producing
radioisotopes.\nApplications are sought for innovative developments and
advances in separation technologies to reduce processing time, to
improve separations efficiencies, to automate separation systems, to
minimize waste streams, and to develop advanced materials for
high-purity radiochemical separations. In particular, the Department
seeks improvements in (1) lanthanide and actinide separations, (2) in
the development of higher binding capacity resins and adsorbents for
radioisotope separations to decrease void volume and to increase
activity concentrations, (3) the scale-up of separation methods
demonstrated on a small scale to large-volume production level, and (4)
new resin and adsorbent materials with increased resistance to
radiation.\nThe following are some new strategies for radioisotope
processing and separation technologies. In lanthanide radiochemistry,
improvements are sought to a) prepare high-purity samarium-153 by
removing contaminant promethium and europium; or b) to prepare
high-purity gadolinium- 148 and gadolinium-153 by ultra-pure separation
from europium, samarium, and promethium contaminants. Sn-117m has gotten
 a lot of interest in the last few years. It has favorable nuclear
properties for both imaging and therapy. However commercial quantities
of the isotope at high specific activity is not available. Supply of
commercial quantities of high specific activity Sn- 117m would be of
high interest. Re-186 has excellent nuclear properties for therapy and
is chemically similar to Tc-99m which is widely used for diagnostic
imaging. Therefore, Re-186 could used as a therapeutic matched pair for
currently available diagnostic imaging agents. However, high specific
activity Re-186 is not available. So, alternative methods of production
or mass separation to remove stable Re isotopes, which can provide
commercial quantities of high specific activity Re-186 is highly
desirable. In actinide radiochemistry, innovative methods are sought a)
to improve radiochemical separations of or lower-cost approaches for
producing highpurity actinium-225 and actinium-227 from contaminant
metals, including thorium, radium, lead, and\/or bismuth; or b) to
improve ion-exchange column materials needed for generating lead-212
from radium-224, and bismuth-213 from actinium-225 or radium-225. The
new technologies must be applicable in extreme radiation fields that are
 characteristic of chemical processing involving high levels of
alpha-and\/or beta-\/gamma-emitting radionuclides. Interested parties

 new program effort that began in FY10, will conduct research at an
integrated system-level on promising concepts and technologies and
explore, assess or demonstrate their benefits in a relevant environment.
 The integrated system-level research in this program will be
coordinated with on-going long-term, foundational research within the
three other research programs, as well as efforts within other Federal
Government agencies. As the NextGen evolves to meet the projected growth
 in demand for air transportation, researchers must address the national
 challenges of mobility, capacity, safety, and energy and the
environment in order to meet the expected growth in air traffic. In
particular, the environmental impacts of noise and emissions are a
growing concern and could limit the ability of the system to accommodate
 growth. ISRP will explore and assess new vehicle concepts and enabling
technologies through system-level experimentation to simultaneously
reduce fuel burn, noise and emissions, and will focus specifically on
maturing and integrating technologies in major vehicle
systems\/subsystems for accelerated transition to practical application.
 ISRP is comprised of two projects - the Environmentally Responsible
Aviation (ERA) Project and the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)
Integration in the National Airspace System (NAS) Project.
Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) The project's primary goal is
 to select vehicle concepts and technologies that can simultaneously
reduce fuel burn, noise and emissions; it contains three subprojects:
Airframe Technology, Propulsion Technology and Vehicle Systems
Integration. Testing unconventional aircraft configurations that have
higher lift to drag ratio, reduced drag and reduced noise around
airports. Achieving drag reduction through laminar flow. Developing
composite (nonmetallic) structural concepts to reduce weight and improve
 fuel burn; and Testing advanced, fuel-flexible combustor technologies
that can reduce engine NOx emissions. The Unmanned Aircraft Systems
(UAS) Integration in the National Airspace System (NAS) The project's
primary goal is to address technology development in several areas to
reduce the technical barriers related to the safety and operational
challenges of UAS routine operations in the NAS. Separation Assurance -
Safely and seamlessly integrate UAS into NextGen separation assurance
through demonstrate of 4DT applications that result in the same or fewer
 losses of separation as traditional separation services. Human Systems
Integration - Demonstrate reduced workload of UAS pilots by advanced
interface design and automation; Collect Human in the Loop (HITL) data
to apply to computational model that provides for 100% situational
awareness of aircraft within 5 nm and 1200 ft; and Develop at standard
against which to assess UAS ground control stations. Communication -
Demonstrate a secure UAS command and control datalink which meets
communication confidentiality, availability and integrity requirements
and which meets FAA communication latency requirements. Certification -
Document applicability of possible certification method meeting
airworthiness requirements for the full range of UAS and collect
UAS-specific data in a civil context to support development of standards
 and regulations. Integrated Test and Evaluation - Creation of an
appropriate test environment; Integration of the technical research to
probe and evaluate the concepts; and Coordination and prioritization of
facility and aircraft schedules.",

        "description": "The following subtopic is in support of the
Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Integration in the National Airspace
System (NAS) Project under ISRP. There is an increasing need to fly UAS
in the NAS to perform missions of vital importance to National Security
and Defense, Emergency Management, Science, and to enable Commercial
Applications. UAS are unable to routinely access the NAS today due to a
lack of: Automated separation assurance integrated with collision
avoidance systems. Robust communication technologies. Robust human
systems integration. Standardized safety and certification. The Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations are built upon the condition
of a pilot being in aircraft. There exist few, if any, regulations
specifically addressing UAS today. The primary user of UAS to date has
been the military. The technologies and procedures to enable seamless
operation and integration of UAS in the NAS need to be developed,
validated, and employed by the FAA through rule making and policy
development. The Project goal is to develop capabilities that reduce
technical barriers related to the safety and operational challenges
associated with enabling routine UAS access to the NAS. This goal will
be accomplished through a two-phased approach based on development of
system-level integration of key concepts, technologies and\/or
procedures, and demonstrations of integrated capabilities in an
operationally relevant environment. The project is further broken down
into five subprojects: Separation Assurance; Communications; Human
Systems Integration; Certification; and Integrated Test and Evaluation.
The fifth sub-project, Integrated Test and Evaluation, integrates the
other four subprojects. The Phase I technical objectives include:
Developing a gap analysis between current state of the art and NextGen
Concept of Operations. Validating the key technical elements identified
by the project requirements. Initial modeling, simulation, and flight
testing. Completion of subproject Phase I deliverables (Spectrum
requirements, comparative analysis of certification methodologies, etc.)
 and continue Phase II preparation (infrastructure, tools, etc.). The
Phase II technical objectives include: Providing regulators with a
methodology for developing airworthiness requirements for UAS, and data
to support development of certifications standards and regulatory
guidance. Providing systems-level, integrated testing of concepts
and\/or capabilities that address barriers to routine access to the NAS,
 through simulation and flight testing, address issues including
separation assurance, communications requirements, and Human Systems
Integration in operationally relevant environments. This solicitation
seeks proposals to develop: Desktop Simulation System for Rapid
Collection of Human-in-the-Loop Simulation Data. Study, design and build
 a desktop human-in-the-loop simulation system that integrates UAS
ground control stations, unmanned vehicles, manned aircraft, and
controller interfaces to rapidly evaluate concepts for separation
assurance, separation algorithms, procedures for off-nominal conditions,
 and other research questions. In addition, investigate training
requirements and verification methods for the quality of the data, the
types of tasks for which such a system could provide meaningful data,
and the architecture required to ensure scalability. The simulation
system could be based on the Multi Aircraft Control System (MACS), which
 already includes all those elements except the UAS ground control
station. An initial implementation could include a single human operator
 with all other agents simulated, while advanced implementations would
connect several instances of the simulator to capture interactions
between human controllers, pilots and UAS operators. UAS Model
Construction from Real-time Surveillance Data. In order to improve
trajectory predictions for aircraft types without detailed models, a
real-time system identification process is needed to automatically
construct propulsion and aerodynamics models from available Air Traffic
Control (ATC) surveillance data (primary or secondary radar, ADS-B,
etc.) while the aircraft is in flight. Initial work would establish what
 real-time surveillance data is required for a model of sufficient
fidelity to reliably predict aircraft trajectories ten or more minutes
into the future and over tens of thousands of vertical feet, and what
types of aircraft maneuvers would provide maximum observability of the
unknown parameters (e.g., the vehicle's response to commanded doublets
in altitude at max climb\/descent speed or step changes in commanded
aircraft velocity as observed by radar or ADS-B). These maneuvers would
be commanded of the UAS by ATC to improve a poorly understood vehicle
model in real-time. Model construction could also be done with archived
surveillance data as a first step, but real-time construction is the
preferred ultimate outcome. Certified control and non-payload
communications (CNPC) system. Current civil UAS operations are
significantly constrained by the lack of a standardized, certified
control and non-payload communications (CNPC) system. The UAS CNPC
system is to provide communications functions between the Unmanned
Aircraft (UA) and the UA ground control station for such applications
as: telecommands; non-payload telemetry; navigation aid data; air
traffic control (ATC) voice relay; air traffic services (ATS) data
relay; sense and avoid data relay; airborne weather radar data; and
non-payload situational awareness video. New and innovative approaches
to providing terrestrial and space-based high-bandwidth CNPC systems
that are inexpensive, small, low latency, reliable, and secure offer
opportunities for quantum jumps in UAS utility and capabilities. Of
particular interest are technologies for the enhancement\/improvement of
 CNPC performance for UAS operations in urban locations, taking into
account the propagation, reflection\/refraction and shadowing\/blockage
environment encountered in the urban environment. System for Rapid
Automated UAS Mission Planning. UAS mission planning is currently a very
 cumbersome and time-consuming activity that involves a highly manual
process. In order to provide better UAS integration in the NAS, an
automated mission planning system is required with the following
capabilities: During the pre-flight mission phase, automation is needed
to identify emergency landing sites, ditch sites, and develop UAS
responses to contingency events at all points along the route
commensurate with UAS platform performance. During the in-flight mission
 phase, automation is needed to assess and integrate real-time weather
information, such as that provided via Flight Information Services -
Broadcast (FIS-B), to dynamically re-plan the route for safe navigation.
 This includes fuel planning and weather assessment capabilities to
select and fly to appropriate alternate destination airfields. During
the in-flight mission phase, automation is needed to assess real-time
route deviations\/changes imposed by Air Traffic Control (ATC). The
assessment would consider fuel, weather and emergency landing\/ditch
site constraints to verify the route change is supportable and safe. ",

        "topic_name": "Antenna Technology",
        "description": "NASA seeks advanced antenna systems and
technologies to enable communications for future space operations, space
 science, Earth science and solar system exploration missions. These
areas, in priority order, are:  Novel Materials for Next Generation
Antennas NASA is interested in exploiting novel materials approaches for
 next generation antennas. For example, "smart" materials such as shape
memory polymers or ionic polymer metal composites to permit active shape
 control or beam correction are of interest. Artificial electromagnetic
media for phase velocity control and impedance tuning to improve the
efficiency and bandwidth of electrically small antennas is of interest.
Emerging novel technologies such as ferroelectrics, multiferroics and
spintronics concepts leading to new antenna designs are desirable.
Smart, Reconfigurable Antennas Smart antennas, reconfigurable in
frequency, polarization and radiation pattern, are of interest for space
 and planetary exploration missions. In particular, antenna designs and
proof-of-concepts leading to the reduction of the number of antennas
needed to meet the communication requirements associated with rovers,
pressurized surface vehicles, habitats, etc., are highly desired. In
addition to the aforementioned reconfigurability requirements, specific
antenna features include multi-beam operation to support connectivity to
 different communication nodes on planetary surfaces, or in support of
communication links for satellite relays around planetary orbits.
Innovative receiver front-ends or technologies that allow for the DSP to
 move closer to the antenna terminal furthering the impact of the
aforementioned, revolutionary "game-changing" antenna technology
concepts are highly desirable.  Ground-based Uplink Antenna Array
Designs NASA is considering arrays of ground-based antennas to increase
capacity and system flexibility, to reduce reliance on large antennas
and high operating costs, and eliminate single point of failure of large
 antennas. A large number of smaller antennas arrayed together results
in a scalable, evolvable system, which enables a flexible schedule and
support for more simultaneous missions. A significant challenge is the
implementation of an array for transmitting (uplinking), which may or
may not use the same antennas that are used for receiving. Arraying
concepts that can enable technology standardization across each NASA
network (i.e., DSN, NEN, and SN), within the framework of the newly
envisioned NASA integrated network architecture, at Ka-band frequencies
and above, are highly desired.  Phased Array Antennas High performance
phased array antennas, i.e., with efficiencies at least 3X that of
state-of-practice MMIC-based phased arrays, are needed for high-data
rate communication at Ka-Band frequencies and above as well as for
remote sensing applications. Communications applications include:
planetary exploration, landers, probes, rovers, extravehicular
activities (EVA), suborbital vehicles, sounding rockets, balloons,
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's), TDRSS communication, and expendable
launch vehicles (ELV's). Also of interest are multi-band phased array
antennas (e.g., X- and Ka-band) and RF\/optical shared aperture dual use
 antennas, which can dynamically reconfigure active elements in order to
 operate in either band as required to maximize flexibility, efficiency
and minimize the mass of hardware delivered to space. Phased array
antennas for space-based range applications to accommodate dynamic
maneuvers are also of interest. The arrays are required to be
aerodynamic or conformal in shape for sounding rockets, UAV's, and
expendable platforms and must be able to withstand the launch
environment. Potential remote sensing applications include: radiometers,
 passive radar interferometer platforms, and synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) platforms for planetary science.  Large Aperture Deployable
Antennas Large aperture deployable antennas with surface
root-mean-square (rms) quality better than \u03bb\/40 at Ka-Band
frequencies and above, are desired. In addition, these antennas should
significantly reduce stowage volume (packaging efficiencies as high as
50:1), provide high deployment reliability, and significantly reduced
mass density (i.e., &amp;lt; 1kg\/m2). These large Gossamer-like
antennas are required to provide high-capacity communication links with
low fabrication costs from deep space (Mars and beyond). Concepts
addressing antenna adaptive beam correction with pointing control are
also of interest. For all above technologies, research should be
conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a
 path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering
 a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the
completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables: Research to
identify and evaluate candidate telecommunications technology
applications to demonstrate the technical feasibility and show a path
towards a hardware\/software demonstration. Bench or lab-level
demonstrations are desirable. Phase II Deliverables: Emphasis should be
placed on developing and demonstrating the technology under simulated
flight conditions. The proposal shall outline a path showing how the

required in communication systems to manage the demands of the harsh
space environment on space electronics, maintain flexibility and
adaptability to changing needs and requirements, and provide flexibility
 and survivability due to increased mission durations. NASA missions can
 have vastly different transceiver requirements ranging from 1's to 10's
 Mbps at UHF &amp;amp; S frequency bands while X &amp;amp; Ka frequency
bands require 10's to 1000's of Mbps. Available mission resources also
vary greatly depending on the science objective, operating environment,
and spacecraft resources. For example, deep space missions are often
power constrained; operating over large distances, and subsequently have
 lower data transmission rates when compared to near-Earth or near
planetary satellites. These requirements and resource limitations are
known prior to launch, which can be used to maximize transceiver

        "description": "NASA seeks revolutionary, highly innovative,
game changing communications technologies that have the potential to
enable order of magnitude performance improvements for space operations,
 exploration systems, and\/or science mission applications. Research is
geared towards far-term research focused in (but not limited to) the
following areas: Develop novel techniques for size, weight, and power
(SWAP) of communications sys-tems by addressing digital processing and
logic implementation tradeoffs, dynamic power management, hardware and
software partitioning. Address high-speed, high resolution, low power
consumption, and radiation tolerance (e.g., SiGe) to support near Earth
and deep space mission environments. Investigate and demonstrate novel
technologies to alleviate the demanding requirements (3- to- 5X
improvement in sampling rate\/resolution over state-of-the-art) on
analog to digital converters (ADCs) and digital signal processors
(DSPs). Develop technologies to evolve NASA communication networking and
 radio capabilities to autonomously sense and adapt to their
environment, detect and repair problems and learn as they operate. Nodes
 will be dynamically aware of state and configuration of other nodes and
 adapt accordingly. Communications and navigation subsystems on future
missions will interpret their situation on their own, understand their
options, and select the best means to communicate or navigate.
High-performance, multifunctional, nano-structured materials are of
interest for applications in human spaceflight and exploration. These
materials (notably single wall carbon nanotubes) exhibit extraordinary
mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties at the nanoscale and
possess exceptionally high surface area. The development of nano-scale
communication devices and systems including nano-antennas,
nano-transceivers, etc. are of interest for nano-spacecraft
applications. Quantum entanglement, quantum key distribution or
innovative breakthroughs in quantum information physics. Address
proposed revolutionary improvements in communicating data, information
or knowledge. Methods or techniques that demonstrate extremely novel
means of effectively packaging, storing, encrypting, and\/or
transferring information are sought. Significant development is needed
in high flux single photon sources and entangled pair sources for highly
 efficient, free space communications. Small spacecraft, due to their
limited surface area, are typically power constrained, limiting small
spacecraft communications systems to low-bandwidth architectures.
Technologies and architectures, which can exploit commercial or other
terrestrial communication infrastructures to enable novel smallsat
missions to enable a wider variety of space missions are desired.
Address how existing communications architectures can be adapted and
utilized to provide routine, low cost, high bandwidth communications
capabilities for spacecraft to ground, and spacecraft to spacecraft
applications. Ultra wide-band (UWB) technology is sought to support
robotic localization of surface assets. Whether two-way ranging (time
-of-flight) or time-difference of arrival, the ability to synchronize
the receivers determine the localization accuracy. Efficient Media
Access Control (MAC) and networking protocols are paramount to ensure
power efficiency and scalability. Integrating communications and
positioning in an ad hoc network can indeed enable situational
awareness, keeping track of location and relative position to other
astronauts, robots, and vehicles at any time through visual and\/or
audio cues. Because initial synchronization or signal acquisition for
Impulse Radio Ultra-Wide Band (IR-UWB) using equivalent-time sampling
takes a long time especially for low pulse repetition rate systems,
precise timing and coherent reception demand more power consumption and
complexity than non-coherent IR-UWB. To maintain clock stability, most
IR-UWB systems do not power down the receivers during operation.
Narrower pulse width spreads the RF energy over a wider bandwidth but
generation of precise low jitter (&amp;lt;10 picoseconds) programmable
timing of the interval between triggers is highly desirable. For
instance, a pulse wide of 1 nanosecond provides a RF signal bandwidth of
 1 GHz or more. Low pulse-to-pulse or sample-to-sample jitter implies a
sampler on a lobe of pulse N can be precisely place on the same lobe of
pulse N +1 with only 10 picoseconds of error. This enables high pulse
integration and high resolution waveform scanning. To improve power
consumption of IR-UWB systems, it is desirable to have multi-correlator
architecture and a fast search schemes that allow rapid switching
between power modes and minimizing waking time. Develop methods for use
of neutrinos for communications, timing, and ranging. Neutrinos are
small, near light speed particles with no electric charge. Since
neutrinos travel through most matter, they could be used for extreme
long-distance signaling. Detection of neutrinos currently require
massive underground liquid detectors. Highly innovative concepts,
methods, techniques to enable neutrino based communication, ranging,
timing, are sought. For all above technologies, research should be
conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a
 path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering
 a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the
completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables: Deliverables
expected at the end of Phase I include trade studies, conceptual
designs, simulations, analyses, reports, etc. at TRL 1-2. Phase II
Deliverables: Demonstrate performance of technique or product through
simulations and models, hardware or software prototypes. It is expected
that at the end of the Phase II award period, the resulting
deliverables\/products will be at or above TRL 3. ",

        "description": "Current launch to orbit vehicles, both
expendable and reusable, require months of preparation for flight.
Although there are available (in-production) practical propulsion
options for such a vehicle, the costs for outfitting the booster stage
are in the hundreds of millions of dollars. If reusable, additional
months are required to verify all components and systems before
re-flight. These costs severely limit what missions NASA can perform.
The propulsion systems are a major focus during this time, yet aircraft
engines are checked and certified for re-flight in less than an hour.
While rocket engines actually have many similarities to aircraft
engines, there are several factors that drive the complexity and
therefore the cost of rocket engines. These include toxic propellants
that require special protections for personnel and the environment,
cryogenic propellants that require complex tank fill operations and
costly specialized ground support equipment, high combustion chamber
temperatures for increased performance and thrust, and high combustion
chamber pressures for increased performance and reduced engine size and
weight. To move more toward low cost access to space, the above barriers
 to low-cost propulsion systems must be addressed and overcome. Of
primary focus are non-toxic propellant combinations that provide
adequate performance without requiring excessive specialized handling
equipment and procedures, and engines that provide reliable and adequate
 performance without needing to push the far limits of temperature and
pressure environments. Component technologies that move toward these
top-level goals that are of interest include: Ablative materials and
manufacturing techniques that increase capability while reducing
production time and cost. Innovative chamber cooling concepts that
reduce manufacturing complexity, reduce pressure drop, and minimize
performance losses caused by cooling. Development of non-toxic
propellants and technologies that enable their use such as catalysts,
compatible materials, feed\/storage systems, etc. Low-cost nozzle
materials, manufacturing techniques, and coatings to reduce the amount
of active cooling required. Ignition concepts that require low part
count and\/or low energy to be used as either primary or redundant
ignition sources. Manufacturing techniques that lower the cost of
manufacturing complex components such as injectors and coolant channels.
 Examples include, but are not limited to, development and demonstration
 of rapid prototype techniques for metallic parts, power metallurgy
techniques for the manufacture of geometrically complex parts, and
application of nanotechnology for near net shape manufacturing. Sensors,
 instruments, and algorithms to diagnose the health of the engine
valves, injector, igniter, chamber, coolant channels, etc. without
requiring hours of manual inspections. Specified target metrics include:
 A cost target of &amp;lt;50% of current earth-to-orbit propulsion with
similar performance. Reduced ground support equipment. Increased
performance margin (e.g., operating temperature % of material limit,
operating stress % of component limit, etc.). These are critical
technology improvements that are required in the next 3 - 8 years.
Projects are required to demonstrate the component or technology to a
TRL level of 5 - 6 in order to allow for infusion into low-cost
earth-to-orbit propulsion systems. The NASA Office of Chief Technologist

needs to enable certain future missions. This subtopic calls for

        "description": "The objective of this subtopic is to
dramatically reduce the cost of achieving low Earth orbit by advancing
the technology required for spaceflight propellant tank development. The
 ability for launch vehicles to combine the significant weight savings
of composite tanks and composite overwrap pressure vessels (COPVs) with
airline like operations could be possible if these tanks are reusable,
reliable, and need little to no maintenance between flights. Composite
and composite overwrap tanks offer significant weight savings, however,
there are significant shortfalls in terms of reusability, especially
when using cryogenic fluids. This lack of reusability severely hampers
adoption of this enabling technology in future reusable vehicle designs.
 This subtopic seeks to mature such emerging technologies pertaining to
high performance, light-weight tanks and pressure vessels suitable for
cryogenic and non-cryogenic temperatures at high pressures; seeks to
develop technologies that extend life and\/or decrease cost while being
mindful of permeability, damage tolerance, safe-life and checkout
issues; and seek out seal and joint development, increasing tank
robustness and life while not increasing weight or cost; all against the
 current state-of-the-art capabilities and technologies. Areas of
interest to develop and\/or demonstrate are as follows: Material
Development: New composite material development specifically for
cryogenic use demonstrating cycling, reparability, and knowledge of
permeability and damage tolerance. Data should clearly show materials
and processes used in producing a vessel that performs well under
long-term use in a cryogenic condition. Vessel performance and cycling
should be analyzed at and during operational conditions (i.e., cryogenic
 conditions) to verify material integrity. The vessel would minimize
micro cracking, should be damage tolerant and repairable, and have
mounting capabilities. Permeability of the material should be addressed
and evaluated against current material usage and limitations.
Reusability and Reliability: Reusable, reliable, and low cost tanks that
 need little to no maintenance between flights and minimal check-out are
 required for economic and operational sustainability. These innovative
propellant tank (either cryogenic or non-cryogenic) developments can:
Ease operability of the tank diagnostics. Enable tank prognostics.
Enable tanks to handle high pressure cycles and loads without leaking or
 developing structural failure. Promote ease of manufacture by more than
 one American company. Promote ease of repair without returning tanks to
 the manufacturer's facility. Promote rapid
certification\/recertification techniques to meet expected FAA
commercial RLV requirements. Data and Technology Development: Of
specific concern and interest are safe-life and damage tolerance
testing. There is much scrutiny regarding the manner and degree of
testing in these areas, specifically after some number of pressure
cycles. Also of concern is the effect of temperature during cycling and
on material integrity. Due to the limited amount of flight and long term
 performance data there is little to base future design on when the
desire is heritage similarity. Thus, development in regards to these
specific metrics (safe-life and damage tolerance testing) would be most
beneficial to both short and long term missions. For the proposed
technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical
feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware
demonstration and testing. Delivery of a demonstration unit for NASA
testing at the completion of the Phase II contract is also required.
Phase I Deliverables: Desired deliverables at the end of Phase I should
be at TRL 3-4. Final report containing: Optimal design and feasibility
of concept. Detailed path towards Phase II demonstration. Detailed
results of Phase I analysis, modeling, prototyping and development
testing . Material coupon data and a prototype sub-scale tank. Phase II
Deliverables: Deliverables expected at the end of Phase II should be at
TRL 5-6. By the end of Phase II, working proof-of-concept technologies,
including features and demonstration of long term, high cycle
performance at cryogenic temperatures, demonstrated and delivered to
NASA for testing and verification. ",

        "description": "The aim of this subtopic is to develop new
technologies to reduce cost and schedule, improve reliability and
quality, and increase safety of Rocket Propulsion Testing. To this end,
proposals for technology development will be accepted for any of the
following four subject areas: Critical Vacuum Sensing. Helium Recovery.
Robust Components. Advanced Propulsion Test Data Management. Critical
Vacuum Sensing Technology  Develop new innovative methods for remotely
and automatically locating and quantifying vacuum leaks in large vacuum
chambers subject to harsh environmental conditions. A new test stand,
A3, is being built at SSC to test rocket engines at altitude conditions.
 Information on A3 Test Stand can be found at the following URLs:
http:\/\/sscfreedom.ssc.nasa.gov\/etd\/ETDTestFacilitiesA3.asp.
http:\/\/www.tulane.edu\/~sse\/FORUM_2010\/pdfs\/e1.pdf.
http:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/centers\/stennis\/pdf\/436170main_A-3%20Test%20Stand%20FS-2010-03-00093.pdf.
 To simulate altitude during rocket engine testing, A3 test stand
produces a vacuum of 0.15psia inside a large, 40 ft diameter, rocket
engine test chamber using 27 chemical steam generators and a 2-stage
diffuser\/ejector system. If vacuum leaks occur, the desired simulated
altitude may not be achievable thus any leaks must be located and
repaired. However, personnel access to the vacuum test chamber during
operation is restricted due to the hazardous nature of its operation.
This makes locating vacuum leaks difficult, if not impossible.
Therefore, automated remote detection and location of areas of air
in-leakage is required. Due to the unique nature of this test facility,
innovation in these technologies is necessary. Performance metrics
include accuracy and sensitivity in detecting leaks in the harsh
operational environment with high levels of noise and vibration while
not producing false leak indications, as well as robust design for the
harsh environment.  Helium Recovery Technology  Helium is a rare and
nonrenewable resource with many properties critical to the commercial,
military, and fundamental scientific research sectors. NASA consumes
approximately 1 million pounds of helium each year, primarily for
purging of cryogenic propellant systems in which the helium is
discharged to atmosphere and lost. The goal of this subtopic thrust area
 is to develop innovative helium recovery technologies that economically
 dissociate helium from large volumes of mixtures of helium, air, and
hydrogen purge discharge, and pressurize the reclaimed helium for
storage and reuse. The total cost of recovering and reusing helium, from
 both capital and energy expenditure, should be less than procuring the
same amount of helium from traditional sources. Also, particular
emphasis is placed on portability (i.e., not a fixed installation) and
speed of separation (near-real-time) that accommodates a single system
servicing numerous distinct sources of helium, air, and hydrogen
mixtures developed over the range of rocket propulsion testing and
ground and flight operations and the temporal transient nature of
production of these mixtures.  Robust Component Technologies  Rocket
propulsion test hardware as well as ground and flight launch operations
hardware regularly experience large and rapid changes in pressures,
temperatures, vibration, and fluid flow rates while demanding high
precision control and reliability. Typical ranges in these parameters
are pressures from vacuum all the way up to 10,000 psi, working fluids
at ambient temperature all the way down to -420F, vibration environments
 in the 100's of G RMS acceleration. These parameters can span their
entire range in milliseconds. State of the art propulsion system testing
 hardware has evolved over time as better materials and experience in
hardware interactions with these environments have progressed.
Innovation in component performance diagnostics technology is required
to continue the current progression in hardware operational reliability,
 cost, and weight optimization. Accordingly, the goal of this subtopic
thrust area is to develop innovative in situ hardware performance
measurement and diagnostics technology along with the accompanying data
acquisition and management systems required for utilization the new
technologies.  Advanced Propulsion Test Data Management Capability
Substantial advances in data capture and storage technologies have
exponentially increased real and near-real time data availability in
rocket propulsion testing. Effective utilization of this increase in
data availability requires evolution of data management technologies,
methods, and concepts that will enable greater and more effective
real-time access, manipulation, and application in the control and
quality of propulsion systems testing. Recent initiatives in development
 of hardware-in-the-loop technologies, merging measured and simulation
data in real time feedback with propulsion test hardware have
demonstrated the feasibility and utility of this technology. The goal of
 this subtopic thrust area is to develop innovative ways to take
advantage of increased propulsion test data availability utilizing high
performance hardware such as GPU based computer systems along with
innovation in algorithms and software to implement new data management
technologies, methods, and concepts. In these subject areas, research
should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I
and show a path toward hardware and\/or software development as
appropriate, which occurs during Phase II and culminates in a
proof-of-concept system. Phase I Deliverables: A final report describing
 optimal design for the technology concept including feasibility, trade
studies, detailed results of Phase I analysis, modeling, prototyping,
and testing as applicable. The report should also contain a detailed
path towards Phase II hardware and\/or software proof-of-concept system.
 The technology concept at the end of Phase I should be at a TRL of 3-4.
 Phase II Deliverables: A working proof-of-concept system successfully
demonstrated in a relevant environment and delivered to NASA for testing
 and verification. The technology at the end of Phase II should be at a
TRL of 6-7. ",

        "description": "This subtopic seeks proposals to develop
technologies that advance capabilities for space telepresence and
mission operations situation awareness, fault diagnosis, isolation, and
recovery onboard the ISS using an onboard free-flyer as a mobile sensor
platform. In order to increase productivity and reduce risks on
long-missions on spacecraft, such as the ISS, leading toward human
exploration, commercialization, and colonization of space, ground
personnel have a need to remotely command a wide-variety of sensors on
mobile platforms to collect data from a variety of positions within
spacecraft. The sensors include, but are not limited to, those capable
of performing imaging, identifying inventory, and measuring
electromagnetic radiation, temperature, acoustics, atmospheric
properties, and chemical concentrations. To increase crew productivity,
it is highly desirable that the mobile platform be capable of being
deployed by ground command, move to the commanded location, collect
data, and then return to its storage dock where it is recharged all
without requiring crew assistance. This subtopic solicitation calls for
developing a variety of software and hardware technologies that would
enable a free-flyer to operate in multiple modules inside ISS including
but not limited to: Free-flyer localization capability without
engineering environment. Collision avoidance capability. Adjustable
autonomous control software that supports safe operation with
low-bandwidth, intermittent command communication loop with varying
latencies &amp;gt; 10 sec. EXPRESS rack-based auto-docking, recharging,
refueling, deployment mechanism with matching free-flyer mechanism.
Quiet propulsion capability meeting ISS noise limit requirements
(&amp;lt;50dB) (e.g., blower, compressed air: compressor may be onboard

RFID-based inventory identification capability. Proposals may address
any one or a combination of the above or related subjects. Three SPHERES
 satellites have operated inside ISS since 2006. In addition to
performing dozens of experiments, these satellites demonstrate that
mobile platforms in the form of free-flyers can be operated on ISS.
However, these satellites have not been operated by ground personnel and
 their current design is inadequate to meet the needs described above
for several reasons, e.g., the satellites require crew assistance to
operate, require that batteries and CO2 cartridges (propellant) be
replaced by crew between test sessions, and are confined to a work area
bounded by external beacons used by the satellites to localize
themselves within their workspace, approximately 2x2x2 meters. However,
the SPHERES satellites may be useful in demonstrating technologies
called for by this subtopic. Proposals are encouraged that leverage the
SPHERES satellites operating onboard ISS and SPHERES engineering units

        "topic_name": "ISS Utilization",
        "description": "NASA is investigating the near- and mid-term
development of highly-desirable systems and technologies that provide
innovative ways either to leverage existing ISS facilities for new
scientific payloads or, to provide on orbit analysis to enhance
capabilities and reduce sample return requirements. Current utilization
of the ISS is limited by available upmass, downmass, and crew time as
well as by the capabilities of the interfaces and hardware already
developed. Innovative interfaces between existing hardware and systems,
which are common to ground research, could facilitate both increased,
and faster, payload development. Desired capabilities include, but are
not limited to, the below examples: Enabling additional cell and
molecular biology culture techniques. Providing innovative hardware to
allow for safe, contained transfer of cells from container to container
within the Microgravity Sciences Glove Box (MSG) would permit new types
of studies on ISS. On orbit analysis techniques that would reduce or
remove the need for downmass - such as a system for gene array tests, or
 kits for DNA extractions for long term storage - are also examples of
hardware possibilities that would extend and enable additional research.
 Providing compact Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) hardware. Development
of a compact robust DLS instrument based on diode lasers and photo
detectors capable of providing significant power and weight savings now
make it possible to measure the diffusion coefficient of experimental
systems using the Light Microscopy Module (LMM) on the International
Space Station (ISS). The light scattering instrument (laser, detector,
optics) to be mounted on a Leica DM\/RXA microscope camera port should
be about the size of a 40mm diameter tube around 60mm long) with
associated support electronics (including the correlator) being able to
fit into a volume of about 30mm x 100mm x 100mm, or less. The intensity
dynamic range should be able to cover between 10^-10 to 10^-7 Watts. The
 relaxation time range should be capable to spanning 200nsec to 50sec.
This peer-reviewed science was considered a decade ago but not developed
 due to technology limitations. It is now possible to meet the required
performance criteria (with the above size and power requirements) to
measure diffusion coefficients. From the measured diffusion coefficient,
 particle size can be extracted, or the temperature determined for the
location being viewed (e.g., in a capillary cell with a temperature
gradient along it) can be deduced (for known particles and solvents)
using the Stokes-Einstein equation. Providing compact laser tweezers and
 supporting software. Development of a compact robust Holographic Laser
Tweezers (LT) instrument and associated control scripts for use with a
microscope on the International Space Station (ISS) based on the recent
developments of holographic techniques. This could expand the types of
experiments conducted on orbit. The laser tweezers that would mount on a
 Leica DM\/RXA microscope should be less than ~100mm on a side and the
associated control electronics should be less than ~150mm on a side.
This technology should now be robust side it is solid-state and no
longer requires gimbaled mirrors. This peer-reviewed science was
previously considered but not developed because of the size and
technology limitations of a decade ago. LT holds open the possibility of
 performing scientific experiments that manipulate groups of particles
that evolve uniquely in space when gravitational sedimentation and
jamming no longer exist. Any new LT and its corresponding control
software should allow for tracking of particle positions to better than
one micron in 3D (before the concentration becomes too high) and impart
rotational forces. Being able to accurately track the position of
particles while measuring the forces on them is important for laying the
 foundations of colloidal engineering. Because of its use on space
station, the instrument should be self-calibrating. The instrument would
 need to meet the size and volume limitations of the Light Microscopy
Module (LMM). Providing additional on-orbit analytical tools. Providing
flight qualified hardware that is similar to commonly used tools in
biological and material science laboratories could allow for an
increased capacity of on-orbit analysis thereby reducing the number of
samples, which must be returned to Earth. Examples of tools that will
reduce downmass or expand on-orbit analysis include: sample handling
tools; mass measurement devices; a (micro) plate reader; a mass
spectrometer; an atomic force microscope (for biological and material
science samples), non-cryogenic sample preservation systems; autonomous
in-situ bioanalytical technologies; centrifuges for analysis and for
providing fractional-g environments; microbial and cell detection and
identification systems; and fluidics and microfluidics systems to allow
autonomous on-orbit experimentation and high throughput screening.
Providing Nanorack compatible inserts to enable additional life science
payloads. Development of 1, 2 and\/or 4 cube design biological payload
hardware for use with the ISS Nanorack platform would decrease the need
for development of multiple control racks and reduce development time of
 future payload experiments. Enabling additional payloads. Innovative
methods for further subdividing payloads lockers would allow for
numerous pico-payloads. Developing multi-generational or multi-use
habitats would reduce the upmass and downmass required to conduct
biological experiments on ISS. The existing hardware suite and
interfaces available on ISS may be found at:

corrosive and highly acidic launch environments. These needs include:
New environmentally friendly technologies for paint removal and surface
preparation that can be applied to large structures. New technologies
must achieve better performance than conventional abrasive blasting
techniques by reducing the cost of collecting and\/or processing waste
while keeping blasting rates the same or better than conventional
technologies. These technologies must work for inorganic zinc coating.
New environmentally friendly technologies for prevention\/reduction of
microbial corrosion in steel piping systems utilizing brackish or
untreated water. Sub-scale or laboratory tests that can be used to
evaluate the suitability of refractory concrete for use in launch pad
and rocket test facilities flame deflectors. Proposed tests must show
that they are relevant to full scale blast effects. Innovative
refractory material application methods to ensure field applications
have the same properties (strength, density, performance, etc...) as
small scale test coupons. Spaceport Processing Evaluation\/Inspection
Tools  Innovative solutions are desired that reduce inspection times,
provide higher confidence in system reliability, increase safety and
lower life cycle costs. Technologies must support identifying composite
material defects, evaluating material integrity, damage inspection
and\/or acceptance testing of composite systems. These include:
Technologies in support of defect detection in composite materials.
Methods for determining structural integrity of composite materials and
bonded assemblies. Non-intrusive inspection of Composite Overwrapped
Pressure Vessels (COPV), Orion heat shield and other composite systems.
In-situ evaluation of refractory concrete as installed in the flame
trenches associated with propulsion test and launch pad infrastructure.
Hypergolic Propellant Sensing Technologies  Technologies for leak
detection and leak visualization for hypergolic propellants, such as:
Novel, cost effective technology solutions to provide leak detection of
hypergolic propellants at concentrations of 10ppb with minimal
environmental sensitivity (i.e., humidity). Sensors and leak detection
systems should provide quantitative data with minimum interferences,
drift, and exposure and recovery time. Novel, cost effective technology
solutions to provide leak detection of hypergolic propellants at
concentrations of 1ppm with minimal environmental sensitivity (i.e.,
humidity). Sensors and leak detection systems should provide
quantitative data with minimum interferences, drift, and exposure and
recovery time. Technology to provide leak visualization of hypergolic
propellants to support operations (propellant loading, pressurization,
leak check). Cold Gas Storage and Servicing of Launch Vehicle Systems
Storing high-pressure pneumatic gases in a chilled state increases the
on board density of gasses used for pressurization during flight.
Traditional solutions embed these 3000 - 6000 psig metallic tanks into
the flight vehicles' main cryogenic propellant tanks. To achieve the
lightest weight tanks, final pressurization takes place after the tanks
are immersed to maximize strength gained by the lower temperatures.
Under these conditions, it takes several hours to achieve thermal
equilibrium with the host tank and maximize mass density of the
compressed gas. Solutions are sought to reduce this time to less than 60
 minutes to achieve thermal equilibrium of the compressed gas with the
host liquid cryogen tank and maximize pneumatic gas mass on board the
flight vehicle. For all above technologies, research should be conducted
 to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path
toward Phase II hardware or software demonstration and delivering a
demonstration unit or package for NASA testing at the completion of the
Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables: Demonstration of technical

        "description": "Digital motion imaging technologies provide
great improvements over analog systems, but also present significant
challenges. Digital High Definition Television (HDTV) cameras flown on
the Shuttle and International Space Station have shown higher
susceptibility to ionizing radiation damage, manifested by visible
"dead" pixels in the image. In order to practically deploy HDTV cameras,
 sensors and processors need to survive operations on orbit for years
without debilitating radiation damage that degrades image quality and
performance. The focus of this subtopic is the development of
components, systems, and core technologies that advance the capabilities
 to capture, process and distribute high-resolution digital motion
imagery without performance degradation from ionizing radiation that
would require frequent upmass to orbit to replace components or systems.
    Current State of the Art  HDTV cameras flown on the Space Shuttle
and the International Space Station have proven to be highly susceptible
 to damage from ionizing radiation. This damage is manifested by bad
pixels that eventually render the camera useless after short periods of
on-orbit use, usually less than one year. In addition, upmass and
downmass constraints make the use of large format motion picture film
cameras impractical, so a digital equivalent is needed for large venue
documentary film productions, such as IMAX films.  Domains of Interest
Domains of interest in the near term address needs for space
environment, radiation tolerant, HDTV and digital cinema cameras and
down-stream video processors. Mid and Long term goals include radiation
tolerant, reprogrammable, highly bandwidth efficient encoders and
improved distribution systems for video data signals. Current HDTV
transmissions from the ISS require approximately 25 Mbps. Bitrates with
equal or better video quality are desired at half that bit rate. These
systems are highly desired by the human spaceflight programs.
Technologies of Interest  Technologies are sought that provide high
resolution, progressively scanned motion imagery with limited or
mitigated radiation damage to sensors, are viable for astronaut
hand-held applications or external spacecraft use, and that provide
imagery that meets standards commonly used by digital television or
digital cinema production facilities. Commercial HDTV cameras used for
internal hand-held use have generally been small and light (5" x 6" x
11", between 2 and 3 pounds), run off rechargeable batteries, and
utilize standard lens mounts. Future cameras for exterior applications
ideally would be smaller and more modular in design (no larger than 4" x
 5" x 7" and 2.5 pounds). The critical technology need is the radiation
tolerance of the sensor, not the size, weight and mass of the camera
that results from such a sensor. While commercial HDTV and Digital
Cinema cameras for use on Earth are mature technologies, there are no
flight-proven radiation tolerant HDTV and Digital Cinema cameras and
sensors currently available. Commercial cameras flown on the Shuttle and
 ISS thus far do function, but degrade within a year on orbit. While
hard to classify, the current TRL for these cameras within the context
of spaceflight operations could be considered to be a 5 or 6. The
ultimate goal is to develop radiation-hardened camera sensors capable of
 surviving three or more years in space. For all above technologies,
research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during
 Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software
demonstration, and delivering a demonstration unit or software package
for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I
Deliverables: Deliverables for Phase I will include designs and
development plans with plausible data and rationale that demonstrates
why the designs and plans should mitigate radiation effects on the
sensors, and a detailed path towards Phase II hardware demonstration.
The report shall also provide options for commercialization
opportunities after Phase II. Phase II Deliverables: Deliverables for
Phase II will include developmental hardware suitable for testing in a
lab or space flight environment (TRL 6) as well as a test plan, relevant
 data, and defined expected lifespan of the sensors. ",

spacecraft and shared by ISS-bound experiment packages is the
requirement for a controlled (or at least known) environment while the
payload is awaiting launch on the launch vehicle or is in transit to the
 ISS. Due to the retirement of the Space Shuttle, NASA has a need for
flight qualified, environmentally conditioned transportation systems
compatible with new space launch systems capable of sustaining and
extending the life of perishable materials and specimens until
experiment packages can be installed and properly interfaced on-board
ISS. This solicitation seeks to develop innovative environmental control
 technologies for the ground and space transportation of nanorack cubes
and cubesats. Cubesat integration timelines frequently call for
passively mating to the launch vehicle or deployer system many weeks in
advance of launch. The environment that the payload experiences plays a
major role on the shelf life of certain materials and specimens within
the spacecraft. Technologies capable of monitoring and extending the
shelf life of perishable payloads are of interest to NASA as the
environment in and around the launch vehicle is not always controlled in
 a manner favorable to a payload. Technologies can be either integrated
directly into the Cubesat or external to the Cubesat. Two applications
for these technologies are sought:&amp;nbsp;ISS Nanorack Transportation
System.This system will have the ability to maintain temperatures within
 relevant ranges for biological and\/or perishable Nanorack payloads
from time of experiment preparation at the payload processing facility
until installation into the host facility on ISS. This also includes
ground transportation phases of the mission.The Transportation System
will also provide a time history of relevant parameters ie temperature,
relative humidity, vibration, etc, during the transportation periods up
to payload installation on ISS.Cubesat applications.Cubesat applications
 involve technologies that may be incorporated into the Cubesat
spacecraft itself, or systems that can be used as adjuncts to monitor
and control the environment in and around the Cubesat
payload\/spacecraft. These technologies can be passive and\/or active in
 nature.Cubesat applications will also provide a time history of
relevant parameters ie temperature, relative humidity, etc during the
dwell time on the pad while awaiting launch.Innovative approaches to
this problem will significantly increase the utility of Nanoracks
modules and\/or Cubesat spacecraft in that this technology will enable
an expanded set of experiment types and mission scenarios. Such a
capability may also be extended in support of ground control experiments
 where on-orbit environments must be duplicated in the lab. Nanorack

development of accurate and stable integrated metric tracking and
inertial measurement units. The focus is on technologies that enable and
 advance development of low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP), tactical

will provide very high frequency integrated metric solutions. The
ability to reliably function on spin-stabilized rockets (up to 7
rev\/s), during sudden jerk and acceleration maneuvers, and in high

Robust tracking during separation. Use of GPS and Ability to Mitigate
Interference Signals  Innovative technologies to increase the accuracy
of the L1 C\/A navigation solution by combining the pseudo ranges and
phases of the L1 C\/A signals, and use of the L2 and L5 carriers.
Factors that degrade the GPS signals can be obtained by differencing the
 available carrier phase and pseudo range measurements and then removing
 these differences from the navigation solution. Technologies are sought
 that combine spatial processing of signals from multiple antennas with
temporal processing techniques to mitigate interference signals

adaptive pattern control (beam and null steering) and digital excision
of certain interfering signal components can minimize strong jamming
signals. Adaptive nulling minimizes interfering signals by the optimal
control of the GPS antenna pattern (null steering). For all above

 General Operational Needs, Requirements and Performance Metrics:
Onboard Near-Earth Navigation Systems  NASA seeks proposals that would
develop a commercially viable transceiver with embedded orbit
determination software to provide enhanced accuracy and integrity for
autonomous onboard GPS- and TDRSS-based navigation and time-transfer in
near-Earth space via augmentation messages broadcast by the proposed
TDRSS Augmentation for Satellites Signal (TASS;
http:\/\/www.gdgps.net\/system-desc\/papers\/Bar-Sever.pdf). Innovations
 that will increase the integration, reducing the size, weight, and
power of such transceiver platforms, and improving their performance in
high radiation environments, are sought. Proposers are advised that
NASA's GEONS and GIPSY orbit determination software packages already
support the capability to ingest TASS messages.  Onboard Deep-Space
Navigation Systems  NASA seeks proposals to develop an onboard
autonomous navigation and time-transfer system for reduction of DSN
tracking requirements. Such a system should provide accuracy comparable
to delta differenced one-way ranging (DDOR) solutions anywhere in the
inner solar system, and exceed DDOR solution accuracy beyond the orbit
of Jupiter. Proposers are advised that NASA's GEONS and AutoNav
navigation software packages already support the capability to ingest
many one way forward Doppler, optical sensor observation, and
accelerometer data types. In addition, NASA is seeking innovative
solutions in the area of planetary surface navigation.  Technologies
Supporting Improved TDRSS-Based Navigation  NASA seeks proposals
providing improvements in TDRS orbit knowledge, TDRSS radiometric
tracking, ground-based orbit determination, and Ground Terminal
improvements that improve navigation accuracy for TDRS users. Methods
for improving TDRS orbit knowledge should exploit the possible future
availability of accelerometer data collected onboard future TDRS. The
goal is navigation and communications integrated into a single
processor.  Navigation Payload Technology for Planetary Relay Satellites
  NASA seeks planetary relay navigation payload technologies that can:
Transmit accurate spread spectrum signals (emphasizing the stability of
the frequency reference yielding accurate timing and chipping rate of
the PN code and a low noise carrier). Receive same in return (either in
coherent mode (the relay transmits and receives using the same frequency
 reference) or non-coherent mode (where the accurate frequency reference
 is on one end of link, either the transmit side or the receive side)).
This relay navigation payload should be capable of receiving a
satellite-to-satellite link with similar signal properties. The relay
navigation payload has to measure the range (two-way), pseudo-range
(one-way), and both one-way and two-way Doppler. The relay navigation
payload must be able to de-commutate data received from Earth and bases
on other planetary surfaces to maintain time synchronization with a
master time source, use the data onboard to either slave its frequency
reference or to update its reference, and turn-around the data to
modulate onto the user data stream. Additionally, the relay navigation
payload must have: 'Reasonable fidelity' autonomous filtered navigation
capability to fuse all data types listed above as well as antenna gimbal
 angles, accelerometer data, and rendezvous radar data, to estimate the
lunar relay state. Output data rates of 1 Hz for the states of multiple
satellites and comprehensive fault detection and correction data. State
outputs that can be modulated on transmitted data streams. TASS-like
broadcast beacon capability for navigation. The data on the beacon can
originate either at a base location (earth, moon), the relay, or another
 asset with which the relay communicates. Dissemination of time and
navigation data for the local environment. Proposals can either address a
 single subject as described above or a combination of subjects. For all
 above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate
technical feasibility during Phase I (to reach TRL 3) and show a path
toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering a

 capabilities with smaller or more affordable spacecraft so development

 of limited resources. The rapid development of small, low-cost remote
sensing and in situ instruments is essential to achieving this
objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the subtopics reflect
 a focus on instrument development for airborne and Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) platforms. Astrophysics has a critical need for sensitive
detector arrays with imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetric
capabilities, which can be demonstrated on ground, airborne, balloon, or
 suborbital rocket instruments. Heliophysics, which focuses on
measurements of the sun and its interaction with the Earth and the other
 planets in the solar system, needs a significant reduction in the size,
 mass, power, and cost for instruments to fly on smaller spacecraft.
Planetary Science has a critical need for miniaturized instruments with
in situ sensors that can be deployed on surface landers, rovers, and
airborne platforms. For planetary missions, planetary protection
requirements vary by planetary destination, and additional backward
contamination requirements apply to hardware with the potential to
return to Earth (e.g., as part of a sample return mission). Technologies
 intended for use at\/around Mars, Europa (Jupiter), and Enceladus

cleaning with alcohol or water, and\/or sterilization treatments such as
 dry heat (approved specification in NPR 8020.12; exposure of hours at

        "description": "Accurate measurements of atmospheric parameters
with high spatial resolution from ground, airborne, and space-based
platforms require advances in the state-of-the-art lidar technology with
 emphasis on compactness, efficiency, reliability, lifetime, and high
performance. Innovative lidar component technologies that directly
address the measurements of the atmosphere and surface topography of the
 Earth, Mars, the Moon, and other planetary bodies will be considered
under this subtopic. Frequency-stabilized lasers for a number of lidar
applications such as CO2 concentration measurements as well as for
highly accurate measurements of the distance between spacecraft for
gravitational wave astronomy and gravitational field planetary science
are among technologies of interest. Single longitudinal mode lasers and
optical filter technologies for high spectral resolution lidars are also
 of interest. Proposals relevant to the development of components that
can be used in planned missions or current technology programs are
highly encouraged. Examples of planned missions and technology programs
are: Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Doppler Wind Lidar,
Lidar for Surface Topography (LIST), Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions
over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS), and Aerosols-Clouds-Ecosystems
 (ACE). In addition, innovative technologies relevant to the NASA
sub-orbital programs, such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and
Venture-class focusing on the studies of the Earth climate, carbon
cycle, weather, and atmospheric composition, are being sought. Research
should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I
and show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration. For the PY11
SBIR Program, we are soliciting only the specific component technologies
 described below: Highly efficient solid state laser transmitter
operating in the 1.0 \u00b5m - 1.7 \u00b5m range with wall-plug
efficiency of greater than 25%. &amp;nbsp;The proposed laser must show
path in maturing to space applications. The laser transmitter must be
capable of single frequency with narrow spectral width capable of
generating transform-limited pulses, and M2 beam quality &amp;lt; 1.5.
We are interested in two different regimes of repetition rate and output
 energy: in one case, repetition rate from 5 kHz to 20 kHz with pulse
energy from 2 - 10 mJ, and in the second case, repetition rate 20 Hz to 2
 kHz with pulse energy from 30 - 300 mJ. In addition, development of
non-traditional optical amplifier architectures that yield optical
efficiency of &amp;gt;70% are of interest. Although amplifiers such as
planar waveguide or grazing incidence have been shown to generate
optical efficiencies &amp;gt;50%, much higher efficiency is needed for
space applications. &amp;nbsp;Proposed solutions should incorporate
electronics packages suitable for use in aircraft demonstration (i.e.,
small, well packaged, low power). Narrow linewidth laser transmitters
and receiver components (seeds, fiber amplifiers, modulators, drivers,
etc.) supporting laser absorption spectroscopy applications in the 1.3,
1.5 and 2.0 micron wavelength regimes. The lasers and components should
be tunable by several nm, support amplitude modulation at frequencies
from 50 KHz to 10 MHz, have frequency stability of less than 3 MHz, and
be capable of mixing and simultaneous transmission of multiple lines for
 differential absorption measurements without introducing non-linear
mixing effects. Techniques for cloud and aerosol discrimination are also
 sought. Efficient and compact single mode solid state or fiber lasers
operating at 1.5 and 2.0 micron wavelength regimes suitable for direct
detection differential absorption lidar (DIAL) and coherent lidar
applications. These lasers must meet the following general requirements:
 pulse energy 0.5 mJ to 50 mJ, repetition rate 10 Hz to 10 kHz, and
pulse duration of either 10 nsec or 200 nsec regimes. Low noise
detectors operating in 1.5 to 2.0 micron wavelength for use in
differential absorption lidar (DIAL) instruments measuring CO2
concentration. Large area (&amp;gt;250 micron dia.) detectors with high
quantum efficiency (&amp;gt;75%), noise equivalent power of less than 2x
 10-14 W\/Hz1\/2, and bandwidth greater than 50 MHZ are being sought.
Additionally, arrays of 4x4 PIN detectors for coherent detection and
avalanche photodiodes with a minimum gain of 10 are of interest. Other
detectors relevant to NASA programs are low-noise, high quantum
efficiency devices operating at 355 nm, 532 nm, and 1064 nm with gain
greater than or equal to 100. These detectors must be linear or
correctable for incident power levels ranging from 0.1 pW to 50 nW and
have bandwidths exceeding 200 MHz with excellent transient recovery.
Novel compact solid-state UV laser for Ozone DIAL measurements from
surface and airborne UAS science platforms that also enables technology
demonstrations for future spaceborne measurements are needed. New and
novel technology developments that enable solid-state UV lasers
operating within the 280 nm - 320 nm wavelength range (305-320 nm for
the spaceborne lasers) generating laser pulses of up to 1 KHz rate and
average output power greater than 1 Watt. Operation at two distinct
wavelengths separated by 10 nm to 15 nm is required for the Ozone
measurements. Scalability of the laser design to power levels greater
than 10 W for space deployment is important. Novel scanning telescope
capable of scanning over 360 degrees in azimuth with nadir angle fixed
in the range of 30 to 45 degrees. Clear apertures scalable to 1 m, good
optical performance (although diffraction limited performance is not
necessary), and high optical efficiency are desired, as is ability to
operate at multiple wavelengths from 1064 nm to 355 nm. Optical
materials (e.g., substrates and coatings) and components should be space
 qualifiable. Phase II should result in a prototype unit capable of
demonstration in a high-altitude aircraft environment, with aperture on
the order 8 inches. Due to issues with spacecraft momentum compensation
and previous investments, concepts for large articulating telescopes
will not be considered responsive to this request, nor will holographic
substrates. Flash Lidar Receiver for planetary landing application with
at least 128X128 pixels capable of generating 3-dimensional images and
detection of hazardous terrain features, such a as rocks, craters and
steep slopes from at least 1 km distance. The receiver must include
real-time image processing capability with 30 Hz frame rate. Embedded
image enhancement and classification algorithms are highly desirable.
Proposals for low noise Avalanche Photodiode (APD) arrays with 256x256
pixels format suitable for use in Flash Lidar receiver will be also
considered. The detector array must operate in the 1.06 to 1.57 micron
region and be able to detect laser pulses with 6 nsec in duration. The
array needs to achieve greater than 90% fill factor with a pitch size of
 50 to 100 microns with provisions for hybridization with an Integrated
Readout Circuit (ROIC). Proposals should show an understanding of one or
 more relevant science needs, and present a feasible plan to fully
develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA program. ",

High-Speed Radar Distributed Target Simulator  Given model inputs of
radar parameters, radar\/target geometries and distributed target
properties, generates simulated radar echo signals. For some missions, a
 single scene would take approximately a year to simulate on a single
processor and global simulations are not feasible. It is critical to
reduce simulation time for global validation of on-board processor. The

enabling technologies for detectors and sensors flown on scientific
instruments as well as advanced telescopes and observatories. As such,
technological improvements to cryogenic systems (as well as components)
further advance the mission goals of NASA through enabling performance
(and ultimately science gathering) capabilities of flight detectors and

is seeking to expand state of the art capabilities in for possible use
on future programs such as GEOID, SPICA, WFirst

(http:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/multimedia\/podcasting\/jpl-europa20090218.html).
 The topic areas are as follows: Extremely Low Vibration Cooling Systems
 - Examples of such systems include Joule Thompson, pulse tube and turbo
 Brayton cycles. Desired cooling capabilities sought are on the order of
 40 mW at 4K or 1 W at 50K. Present state of the art capabilities
display &amp;lt; 100 mN vibration at operational frequencies of 30-70
Hz. Proposed systems should either satisfy or improve upon this
benchmark. Advanced Magnetic Cooler Components - An example of an
advanced magnetic cooler might be Adiabatic Demagnetization
Refrigeration systems. Specific components sought include: Low current
superconducting magnets. Active\/Passive magnetic shielding (3-4 Tesla
magnets). Single or Polycrystalline magnetocaloric materials (&amp;lt; 1
 cm3). Superconducting leads (10K - 90K) capable of 10 amp operation

Distributed Cooling Systems - Distributed cooling provides increased
lifetime of cryogen fluids for applications on both the ground and
spaceborne platforms. This has impacts on payload mass and volume for
flight systems which translate into costs (either on the ground, during
launch or in flight). Cooling systems that provide continuous
distributed flow are a cost effective alternative to present

        "description": "Planned future NASA Missions in astrophysics,
such as: Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and the New
Worlds Technology Development Program (coronagraph, external occulter
and interferometer technologies) will push the state of the art in
current optomechanical technologies. Mission concepts for New Worlds
science would require 10 - 30 m class, cost-effective telescope
observatories that are diffraction limited at wavelengths from the
visible to the far IR, and operate at temperatures from 4 - 300 K. In
addition, ground based telescopes such as the Cerro Chajnantor Atacama
Telescope (CCAT) require similar technology development. The desired
areal density is 1 - 10 kg\/m2 with a packaging efficiency of 3-10
deployed\/stowed diameter. Static and dynamic wavefront error tolerances
 to thermal and dynamic perturbations may be achieved through passive
means (e.g., via a high stiffness system, passive thermal control,
jitter isolation or damping) or through active opto-mechanical control.
Large deployable multi-layer structures in support of sunshades for
passive thermal control and 20m to 50m class planet finding external
occulters are also relevant technologies. Potential architecture
implementations must package into an existing launch volume, deploy and
be self-aligning to the micron level. The target space environment is
expected to be the Earth-Sun L2. This subtopic solicits proposals to
develop enabling, cost effective component and subsystem technology for
deploying large aperture telescopes with low cost. Research areas of
interest include: Precision deployable structures and metrology for
optical telescopes (e.g., innovative active or passive deployable
primary or secondary support structures). Architectures, packaging and
deployment designs for large sunshields and external occulters. In
particular, important subsystem considerations may include: Innovative
concepts for packaging fully integrated subsystems (e.g., power
distribution, sensing, and control components). Mechanical, inflatable,
or other precision deployable technologies. Thermally-stable materials
(CTE &amp;lt; 1ppm) for deployable structures. Innovative systems, which
 minimize complexity, mass, power and cost. Innovative testing and
verification methodologies. The goal for this effort is to mature
technologies that can be used to fabricate 16 m class or greater,
lightweight, ambient or cryogenic flight-qualified observatory systems.
Proposals to fabricate demonstration components and subsystems with
direct scalability to flight systems through validated models will be
given preference. The target launch volume and expected disturbances,
along with the estimate of system performance, should be included in the
 discussion. Proposals with system solutions for large sunshields and
external occulters will also be accepted. A successful proposal shows a
path toward a Phase II delivery of demonstration hardware scalable to 5
meter diameter for ground test characterization. Proposals should show
an understanding of one or more relevant science needs, and present a
feasible plan to fully develop the relevant subsystem technologies and
to transition into future NASA program(s). ",

        "description": "The National Academy Astro2010 Decadal Report
specifically identifies optical components and coatings as key
technologies needed to enable several different future missions,
including: X-ray imaging mirrors for the International X-Ray Observatory
 (IXO). Active lightweight x-ray imaging mirrors for future very large
advanced x-ray observatories. Large aperture, lightweight mirrors for
future UV\/Optical telescopes. Broadband high reflectance coatings for
future UV\/Optical telescopes. X-ray mirrors are identified by the
Decadal as the most important, critical technology needed for IXO. IXO
requires 3 m2 collecting aperture x-ray imaging mirror with 5 arc-second
 angular resolution. Mirror areal density depends upon available launch
vehicle capacities. Additionally, future x-ray missions require advanced
 multilayer high-reflectance coating for hard x-ray mirrors (i.e.,
NuSTAR) and x-ray transmission\/reflection gratings. Future UVOIR
missions require 4 to 8 or 16 meter monolithic and\/or segmented primary
 mirrors with &amp;lt; 10 nm rms surface figures. Mirror areal density
depends upon available launch vehicle capacities to Sun-Earth L2 (i.e.,
15 kg\/m2 for a 5 m fairing EELV vs. 60 kg\/m2 for a 10 m fairing SLS).
Additionally, future UVOIR missions require high-reflectance mirror
coatings with spectral coverage from 100 to 2500 nm. Heliophysics
missions also require advanced lightweight, super-polished precision
normal and grazing incidence optical components and coatings. Potential
missions which could be enabled by these technologies include: Origins
of Near-Earth Plasma (ONEP); Ion-Neutral Coupling in the Atmosphere
(INCA); Dynamic Geospace Coupling (DGC); Fine-scale Advanced Coronal
Transition-Region Spectrograph (FACTS); Reconnection and Micro-scale
(RAM); and Solar-C. Heliophysics missions need normal incidence mirror
systems ranging from 0.35 meter to 1.5 meters with surface figure errors
 of 0.1 micro-radians rms slope from 4-mm to 1\/2 aperture spatial
periods, roughness of 0.2-nm rms and micro-roughness of 0.1-nm rms; and,
 grazing incidence mirror systems with an effective collecting area of
~3 cm2 from 0.1 to 4 nm, 4 meter effective focal length, 0.8 degree
angle of incidence and surface roughness of 0.2-nm rms. Additionally,
future Heliophysics missions require high-reflectance normal incidence
spectral, broadband, dual and even three-band pass multi-layer EUV
coatings. The geosynchronous orbit for GEO-CAPE coastal ecosystem imager
 requires technology for alternative solar calibration strategies
including new materials to reduce weight, and new optical analysis to
reduce the size of calibration systems. GEO-CAPE will need a lightweight
 large aperture (greater than 0.5 m) diffuse solar calibrator, employing
 multiple diffusers to track on-orbit degradation. Typical materials of
interest are PTFE (such as Spectralon\u00ae surface diffuser) or
development of new Mie scattering materials for use as volume diffusers
in transmission or reflection. Finally, NASA is developing a heavy lift
space launch system (SLS). An SLS with a 10 meter fairing and 100 mt
capacity to LEO would enable extremely large space telescopes. Potential
 systems include 12 to 30 meter class segmented primary mirrors for
UV\/optical or infrared wavelengths and 8 to 16 meter class segmented
x-ray telescope mirrors. These potential future space telescopes have
very specific mirror technology needs. UV\/optical telescopes (such as
ATLAST-9 or ATLAST-16) require 1 to 3 meter class mirrors with &amp;lt; 5
 nm rms surface figures. IR telescopes (such as SAFIR\/CALISTO) require 2
 to 3 to 8 meter class mirrors with cryo-deformations &amp;lt; 100 nm
rms. X-ray telescopes (such as GenX) require 1 to 2 meter long grazing
incidence segments with angular resolution &amp;lt; 5 arc-sec down to
0.1 arc-sec and surface micro-roughness &amp;lt; 0.5-nm rms. In all
cases, the most important metric for an advanced optical system is
affordability or areal cost (cost per square meter of collecting
aperture). Currently both x-ray and normal incidence space mirrors cost
$3 million to $4 million per square meter of optical surface area. This
research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components
by 20 to 100 times, to less than $100K\/m2. The subtopic has three
objectives: Develop and demonstrate technologies to manufacture and test
 ultra-low-cost precision optical systems for x-ray, UV\/optical or
infrared telescopes. Potential solutions include, but are not limited
to, new mirror materials such as silicon carbide, nanolaminates or
carbon-fiber reinforced polymer; or new fabrication processes such as
direct precision machining, rapid optical fabrication, roller embossing
at optical tolerances, slumping or replication technologies to
manufacture 1 to 2 meter (or larger) precision quality mirror or lens
segments (either normal incidence for UV\/optical\/infrared or grazing
incidence for x-ray). Solutions include reflective, transmissive,
diffractive or high order diffractive blazed lens optical components for
 assembly of large (16 to 32 meter) optical quality primary elements.
The EUSO mission requires large-aperture primary segmented refractive,
Fresnel or kinoform PMMA or CYTOP lenses with &amp;lt; 20 nm rms smooth
surfaces for low scatter. Develop and demonstrate optical coatings for
EUV and UVOIR telescopes. UVOIR telescopes require broadband (from 100
nm to 2500 nm) high-reflectivity mirror coating with extremely uniform
amplitude and polarization properties. Heliophysics missions require
high-reflectance (&amp;gt; 90%) normal incidence spectral, broadband,
dual and even three-band pass multi-layer coatings over the spectral
range from 6 to 200 nm. Studies of improved deposition processes for new
 UV reflective coatings (e.g., MgF2), investigations of new coating
materials with promising UV performance, and examination of handling
processes, contamination control, and safety procedures related to
depositing coatings, storing coated optics, integrating coated optics
into flight hardware are all areas where progress would be valuable. In
all cases, an ability to demonstrate optical performance on 2 to 3 meter
 class optical surfaces is important. Large aperture diffusers (up to 1
meter) for periodic calibration of GeoStationary Earth viewing sensors
by viewing the sun either in reflection or transmission off the
diffuser. In regard to large-aperture diffusers material needs to be
stable in BTDF\/BSDF to 2%\/year from 250nm -2.5 microns and highly
lambertian (no formal specification for deviation from lambertian.
Proposals should show an understanding of one or more relevant science
needs, and present a feasible plan to fully develop a technology and
infuse it into a NASA program. ",

being researched for these missions are large area aspheres, requiring
accurate figuring and polishing across six orders of magnitude in
period. Technologies are sought that will enhance the figure quality of
optics in any range as long as the process does not introduce artifacts
in other ranges. For example, mm-period polishing should not introduce
waviness errors at the 20 mm or 0.05 mm periods in the power spectral
density. Also, novel metrological solutions that can measure figure
errors over a large fraction of the PSD range are sought, especially
techniques and instrumentation that can perform measurements while the
optic is mounted to the figuring\/polishing machine. A new area of
interest is large lightweight monolithic metallic aspheres manufactured
using innovative mirror substrate materials that can be assembled and
welded together from smaller segments. By the end of a Phase II program,
 technologies must be developed to the point where the technique or
instrument can dovetail into an existing optics manufacturing facility

Science Mission Directorate will require increasingly sophisticated
thermal control technology. Innovative proposals for the crosscutting
thermal control discipline are sought in the following areas: New
generations of electronics used on numerous missions have higher power
densities than in the past. High conductivity, vacuum-compatible
interface materials that minimize losses across make\/break interfaces
are needed to reduce interface temperature gradients and facilitate heat
 removal. Sensitive instruments and electronics drive increased
requirements for high electrical conductivity on spacecraft surfaces.
This has increased the need for advanced thermal control coatings,
particularly those with low absorptance, high emittance, and good
electrical conductivity. Also, variable emittance surfaces to modulate
heat rejection are needed. Exploration science missions beyond Earth
orbit present engineering challenges requiring systems that can
withstand extreme temperatures ranging from high temperatures on Venus
to the cryogenic temperatures of the outer planets. High performance
insulation systems, which are more easily fabricated than traditional
multi-layer (MLI) systems, are required for both hot and cold
environments. Potential applications include traditional vacuum
environments, low-pressure carbon dioxide atmospheres on Mars, and
high-pressure atmospheres found on Venus. Systems that incorporate
Micro-meteorite and Orbital Debris protection (MMOD) are also of

missions such as Earth Orbiting, Venus, Europa, Titan\/Enceladus
Flagship, Lunar Quest and Space Weather missions. Under this subtopic,
proposals are solicited to develop energy storage and power electronics
to enable or enhance the capabilities of future science missions. The
unique requirements for the power systems for these missions can vary
greatly, with advancements in components needed above the current State
of the Art (SOA) for high energy density, high power density, long life,
 high reliability, low mass\/volume, radiation tolerance, and wide
temperature operation. Other subtopics that could potentially benefit
from these technology developments include S5.05 - Extreme Environments
Technology, and S5.01 - Planetary Entry, Descent and Landing Technology.
 Battery development could also be beneficial to X6.02 - Advanced
Space-rated Batteries, which is investigating some similar technologies
in the secondary battery area but with very different operational
requirements. Power Management and Distribution could be beneficial to
X8.05 - Advanced Power Conversion, Management and Distribution (PMAD)

roadmap (http:\/\/sec.gsfc.nasa.gov\/2009_Roadmap.pdf), the 2010 SMD

 the 2011 PSD Relevant Technologies document, the 2006 Solar System
Exploration (SSE) Roadmap
(http:\/\/nasascience.nasa.gov\/about-us\/science-strategy), and the
2003 SSE Decadal Survey describe the need for lighter weight, lower
power electronics along with radiation hardened, extreme environment
electronics for planetary exploration. Radioisotope power systems (RPS)
and Power Processing Units (PPUs) for Electric Propulsion (EP) are two
programs of interest that would directly benefit from advancements in
this technology area. Advances in electrical power technologies are
required for the electrical components and systems for these future
platforms to address program size, mass, efficiency, capacity,
durability, and reliability requirements. In addition, the Outer Planet
Assessment Group has called out high power density\/high efficiency
power electronics as needs for the Titan\/Enceladus Flagship and
planetary exploration missions. These types of missions, including Mars
Sample Return using Hall thrusters and PPUs, require advancements in
radiation hardened power electronics and systems beyond the
state-of-the-art. Of importance are expected improvements in energy
density, speed, efficiency, or wide-temperature operation (-125oC to
over 450oC) with a number of thermal cycles. Advancements are sought for
 power electronic devices, components and packaging for programs with
power ranges of a few watts for minimum missions to up to 20 kilowatts
for large missions. In addition to electrical component development, RPS
 has a need for intelligent, fault-tolerant Power Management And
Distribution (PMAD) technologies to efficiently manage the system power
for these deep space missions. SMD's In-space Propulsion Technology and
Radioisotope Power Systems programs are direct customers of this
subtopic, and the solicitation is coordinated with the 2 programs each
year. Overall technologies of interest include: High voltage, radiation
hardened, high temperature components, such as capacitors and
semiconductors, for EP PPU applications. High power density\/high
efficiency power electronics. High temperature devices and
components\/power converters (up to 450oC). Intelligent, fault-tolerant
electrical components and PMAD systems. Advanced electronic packaging
for thermal control and electromagnetic shielding. In addition,
development is needed in the area of advanced High Voltage
Transformer-Rectifier Technology Development for Advanced Cloud and
Precipitation Radars, Interferometers, and other Advanced
SAR&amp;nbsp;applications where an integrated Transformer-Rectifier
Assembly is needed to provide increased stability in the output voltages
 provided to the Cathode and Collector of a Vacuum Tube
(EIK).&amp;nbsp;This would result in increases in&amp;nbsp;the RF phase
stability of the output RF Pulse or current approaches. The
Transformer-Rectifier Assembly should address using innovative,
single-integrated body regulator designs that regulate collector vs.
cathode potential, and demonstrate increasing voltage stability over
other approaches. The entire Transformer-Rectifier Assembly
(Cathode-Collector-Body)&amp;nbsp;should be optimized to achieve maximum
 energy efficiency and minimum size\/mass of the system taking into
account necessary high voltage insulation and potting for operation in a
 space environment (vacuum). Of interest are assemblies that
demonstrate: Cathode voltages in excess of -12 kV, and Collector voltage
 in the -3 KV ranges with Beam currents in excess of 340 mA. Assemblies
for which the primary winding of the transformer is driven through 60VDC
 (full load) switched at a nominal frequency of 40.5\u00b11.5kHz, or
higher. Duty cycles up to 16%. Energy Storage Future science missions
will require advanced primary and secondary battery systems capable of
operating at temperature extremes from -100oC for Titan missions to 400o
 to 500oC for Venus missions, and a span of -230\u00b0C to +120\u00b0C
for Lunar Quest. The Outer Planet Assessment Group and the 2011 PSD
Relevant Technologies Document have specifically called out high energy
density storage systems as a need for the Titan\/Enceladus Flagship and
planetary exploration missions. In addition, high energy-density
rechargeable electrochemical battery systems that offer greater than
50,000 charge\/discharge cycles (10 year operating life) for
low-Earth-orbiting spacecraft, 20-year life for geosynchronous (GEO)
spacecraft, are desired. Advancements to battery energy storage
capabilities that address one or more of the above requirements for the
stated missions combined with very high specific energy and energy
density (&amp;gt;200 Wh\/kg for secondary battery systems), along with
radiation tolerance are of interest. In addition to batteries, other
advanced energy storage\/load leveling technologies designed to the
above mission requirements, such as flywheels, supercapacitors or
magnetic energy storage, are of interest. These technologies have the
potential to minimize the size and mass of future power systems.
Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during
 Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II, and when possible, deliver a
 demonstration unit for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II
contract. Phase II emphasis should be placed on developing and
demonstrating the technology under relevant test conditions.
Additionally, a path should be outlined that shows how the technology
could be commercialized or further developed into science-worthy
systems.  Disclaimer: Technology Available (TAV) subtopics may include

semiconductor electronic device applications is disclosed. This method
utilizes a lateral growth process that better overcomes the effect of
extended defects in the seed crystal substrate that limited the

step-free SiC surface is particularly suited for the heteroepitaxial
growth of 3C (cubic) SiC, AlN, and GaN films used for the fabrication of

        "topic_name": "Terrestrial and Planetary Balloons",
        "description": "NASA's Scientific Balloons provide practical and
 cost effective platforms for conducting discovery science, development
and testing for future space instruments, as well as training
opportunities for future scientists and engineers. Balloons can reach
altitudes above 36 kilometers, with suspended masses up to 3600
kilograms, and can stay afloat for several weeks. Currently, the Balloon
 Program is on the verge of introducing an advanced balloon system that
will enable 100-day missions at mid latitudes and thus resemble the
performance of a small spacecraft at a fraction of the cost. In support
of this development, NASA is seeking innovative technologies in three
key areas to monitor and advance the performance of this new vehicle.
Power Storage Devices or methods to store electrical energy onboard the
balloon with lower mass than current techniques are needed.&amp;nbsp;
Long duration balloon flights at mid-latitudes will experience up to 12
hours of darkness, during which electrical power is needed for
experiments and NASA support systems.&amp;nbsp; Typically, solar panels
are flown to generate power during the daylight hours, and excess power
is readily available.&amp;nbsp; This excess power needs to be stored for
 use during the night.&amp;nbsp; Current power storage techniques
consist of rechargeable batteries that range from lead-acid to
lithium-ion chemistries.&amp;nbsp; Innovative alternatives to these
batteries, either advanced chemistries or alternate power storage
techniques such as capacitors or flywheels, which result in overall mass
 savings are needed.&amp;nbsp; Nominal voltage levels for balloon
systems are 28 volts DC, and nominal power levels can vary from 100
watts to 1000 watts.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, power storage requirements
range from 1000 watt-hours to 12,000 watt-hours or more.&amp;nbsp;
Alternative power systems that do not rely on solar panels may also be
proposed.&amp;nbsp; These alternative systems may use energy storage
techniques such as fuel cells or flywheels, which are prepared or
charged on the ground prior to flight, and then would provide continuous
 power throughout the flight at the power levels specified above.
Balloon Instrumentation Devices or methods are desired to accurately
measure ambient air temperature, helium gas temperature, balloon film
temperatures, film strain, and tendon load. These measurements are
needed to accurately model the balloon performance during a typical
flight at altitudes of approximately 36 kilometers. The measurements
must compensate for the effects of direct solar radiation through
shielding or calculation. Minimal mass and volume are highly
desired.&amp;nbsp; Remote sensing of the parameters and non-invasive and
 non-contact approaches are also desired.&amp;nbsp; The non-invasive and
 non-contact approaches are highly desired for the thin polyethylene
film measurements used as the balloon envelope, with film thickness
ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 mil.&amp;nbsp; Strain measurements of these thin
 films via in-flight photogrammetric techniques would be
beneficial.&amp;nbsp; Devices or methods to accurately measure axially
loaded tendons on an array of ~50 or up to 300 separate tendons during
flight are of interest.&amp;nbsp; Tendons are typically captured at the
end fittings via individual pins with loading levels ranging from ~20 N
to ~8,000 N per tendon, and can be exposed to temperatures from room
temperature to the troposphere temperatures of -90 degrees Celsius or
colder.&amp;nbsp; The measurement devices must be compatible with
existing NASA balloon packaging, inflation, and launch methods. These
instruments must also be able to interface with existing NASA balloon
flight support systems or alternatively, a definition of a data
acquisition solution be provided.&amp;nbsp; Support telemetry systems
are not part of the this initiative; however, data from any sensors
(devices) that are selected from this initiative must be able to be
stored on board and\/or telemetered in-flight using single-channel
(two-wire) interface into existing NASA balloon flight support
systems.&amp;nbsp; The devices of interest shall be easily integrated
and shall have minimal impact on the overall mass of the balloon system.
  Low-Cost Variable Conductance Heat Pipes for Balloon Payloads With the
 ever-increasing complexity of both scientific instruments and NASA
mission support equipment, advanced thermal control techniques are
needed. The type of advanced thermal control techniques desired are
similar to those utilized on large-budget orbital and deep space
payloads (variable conductance heat pipes, diode heat pipes, loop heat
pipes, capillary pumped loops, heat switches, louvers), but these
techniques are far more expensive to implement on balloon payloads that
their limited budgets can afford. Innovative solutions are sought that
would allow these more advanced thermal control measures to be utilized
with reduced expense. Though not considered "cutting-edge technology",
commercial quality, constant conductance, copper-methanol heat pipes
have begun to be utilized on balloon payloads to effectively move heat
significant distances. The problem with these devices is that the
conductance cannot effectively be reduced under cold operating or cold
survival environment conditions without expending significant energy in
an active heater to keep the condenser section warm. It is desirable to
develop a cost-effective method of conducting the heat in this manner
while allowing the flow to be reduced\/eliminated when conditions
warrant. Innovative thermal control techniques and devices developed
must be inexpensive to implement. They must function reliably at balloon
 altitudes of 30-40 km and temperature ranges from -90\u00b0C to
+40\u00b0C. They should require little or no energy consumption and
provide the capability of moderating heat flow autonomously or by remote
 control under certain thermal conditions.  Planetary Balloon
Technologies Innovations in materials, structures, and systems concepts
have enabled buoyant vehicles to play an expanding role in planning
NASA's future Solar System Exploration Program. Balloons are expected to
 carry scientific payloads at Titan and Venus that will perform in situ
investigations of their atmospheres and near surface environments. Both
Titan and Venus feature extreme environments that significantly impact
the design of balloons for those two worlds. Proposals are sought in the
 following areas:  Steerable Antenna for Titan and Venus
Telecommunications Many concepts for Titan and Venus balloons require
high gain antennas mounted on the balloon gondola to transmit data
directly back to Earth. This approach requires that the antenna remain
pointed at the Earth despite the motions experienced during balloon
flight. A beacon signal from the Earth will be available to facilitate
pointing. Innovative concepts are sought for such an antenna and
pointing system with the following characteristics: antenna diameter of
0.8 m, total mass of antenna and pointing system of = 10 kg, power
consumption for the steering system = 5 W (avg.), pointing accuracy =
0.5 deg (continuous), hemispheric pointing coverage (2 pi steradians),
azimuthal and rotational slew rates ( 30 deg\/sec. It is expected that a
 Phase I effort will involve a proof-of-concept experiment leading to a
plan for full scale prototype fabrication and testing in Phase II. Phase
 II testing will need to include an Earth atmosphere balloon flight in
the troposphere to evaluate the proposed design under real flight
conditions.  Long-Life Ballonets for Titan Aerobots Maintenance of a
pressurized balloon shape during large altitude changes requires an
internal bladder, or ballonet, that can fill and discharge atmospheric
gas and thereby maintain the total gas-filled volume. Ballonets are
commonplace in terrestrial blimps and airships; however, the cryogenic
85 K temperature at Titan reduces the flexibility of polymer materials
and greatly increases the likelihood of pinhole defect formation over
time. Innovative concepts are sought for materials and system designs of
 a ballonet that can function pinhole-free at 85 K for a minimum of 6
months at Titan while executing repeated altitude excursions from 100 m
to 10,000 m. The proposed ballonet design should be scalable across the
range of 1 to 50 m3 in volume. Preference will be given to projects that
 do some cryogenic experimentation in Phase I that builds confidence in
the viability of the proposed approach. ",

extreme environments technology, sample acquisition and preparation for
in situ experiments, and in situ planetary science instruments. Robotic
exploration missions that are planned include a Europa Jupiter System
mission, Titan Saturn System mission, Venus In Situ Explorer, sample
return from Comet or Asteroid and lunar south polar basin and continued
Mars exploration missions launching every 26 months including a network
lander mission, an Astrobiology Field Laboratory, a Mars Sample Return
mission and other rover missions. Numerous new technologies will be
required to enable such ambitious missions. The solicitation for in situ
 planetary instruments can be found in the in situ instruments section
of this solicitation. See URL:

information. See URL: (http:\/\/marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov\/) for
additional information on Mars Exploration technologies. Planetary
protection requirements vary by planetary destination, and additional
backward contamination requirements apply to hardware with the potential
 to return to Earth (e.g., as part of a sample return mission).
Technologies intended for use at\/around Mars, Europa (Jupiter), and
Enceladus (Saturn) must be developed so as to ensure compliance with
relevant planetary protection requirements. Constraints could include
surface cleaning with alcohol or water, and\/or sterilization treatments
 such as dry heat (approved specification in NPR 8020.12; exposure of

        "description": "NASA seeks innovative sensor technologies to
enhance success for entry, descent and landing (EDL) operations on
missions to Mars. This call is not for sensor processing algorithms.
Sensing technologies are desired that determine the entry point of the
spacecraft in the Mars atmosphere; provide inputs to systems that
control spacecraft trajectory, speed, and orientation to the surface;
locate the spacecraft relative to the Martian surface; evaluate
potential hazards at the landing site; and determine when the spacecraft
 has touched down. Appropriate sensing technologies for this topic
should provide measurements of physical forces or properties that
support some aspect of EDL operations. NASA also seeks to use
measurements made during EDL to better characterize the Martian
atmosphere, providing data for improving atmospheric modeling for future
 landers. Proposals are invited for innovative sensor technologies that
improve the reliability of EDL operations. Products or technologies are
sought that can be made compatible with the environmental conditions of
spaceflight, the rigors of landing on the Martian surface, and planetary
 protection requirements. Successful candidate sensor technologies can
address this call by: Providing critical measurements during the entry
phase (e.g., pressure and\/or temperature sensors embedded into the
aeroshell). Improving the accuracy on measurements needed for guidance
decisions (e.g., surface relative velocities, altitudes, orientation,
localization). Extending the range over which such measurements are
collected (e.g., providing a method of imaging through the aeroshell, or
 terrain-relative navigation that does not require imaging through the
aeroshell). Enhancing the situational awareness during landing by
identifying hazards (rocks, craters, slopes), or providing indications
of approach velocities and touchdown. Substantially reducing the amount
of external processing needed to calculate the measurements.
Significantly reducing the impact of incorporating such sensors on the
spacecraft in terms of volume, mass, placement, or cost. Providing
testbeds (e.g., free-flying vehicles) for closed-loop testing of GNC
sensors and technologies used in the powered descent landing phase. For a
 sample return mission, monitoring local environmental (weather)
conditions on the surface just prior to planetary ascent vehicle launch,

and processing are critical to the next generation of robotic explorers
for investigation of planetary bodies
(http:\/\/books.nap.edu\/openbook.php?record_id=10432&amp;amp;page=R1).
Limited spacecraft resources (power, volume, mass, computational
capabilities, and telemetry bandwidth) demand innovative, integrated
sampling systems that can survive and operate in challenging
environments (e.g., extremes in temperature, pressure, gravity,
vibration and thermal cycling). Special interest lies in sampling
systems and components (actuators, gearboxes, etc.) that are suitable
for use in the extremely hot high-pressure environment at the Venusian
surface (460\u00baC, 93 bar), as well as for asteroids and comets.
Relevant systems could be integrated on multiple platforms, however of
primary interest are samplers that could be mounted on a mobile
platform, such as a rover. For reference, current Mars-relevant rovers
range in mass from 200 - 800 kg.  Sample Acquisition  Research should be
 conducted to develop compact, low-power, lightweight subsurface
sampling systems that can obtain 1 cm diameter cores of consolidated
material (e.g., rock, icy regolith) up to 10 cm below the surface.
Systems should be capable of autonomously acquiring and ejecting samples
 reliably, with minimal physical alteration of samples. Also of interest
 are methods of autonomously exposing rock interiors from below
weathered rind layers. Other sample types of interest are unconsolidated
 regolith, dust, and atmospheric gas. Asteroid and comet samplers are
also of interest.   Sample Manipulation (e.g., core management,
sub-sampling\/sorting, powder transport) Sample manipulation
technologies are needed to enable handling and transfer of structured
and unstructured samples from a sampling device to instruments and
sample processing systems. Core, cuttings, and regolith samples may be
variable in size and composition, so a sample manipulation system needs
to be flexible enough to handle the sample variability. Core samples
will be on the order of 1 cm diameter and up to 10 cm long. Soil and
rock fragment samples will be of similar volumes.   Sample Integrity
(e.g., encapsulation and contamination control) For a sample return
mission, it is critical to find solutions for maintaining physical
integrity of the sample during the surface mission (rover driving loads,
 diurnal temperature fluctuations) as well as the return to Earth
(cruise, atmospheric entry and impact). Technologies are needed for
characterizing state of sample in situ - physical integrity (e.g.,
cracked, crushed), sample volume, mass or temperature, as well as
retention of volatiles in solid (core, regolith) samples, and retention
of atmospheric gas samples. Also of particular need are means of
acquiring subsurface rock and regolith samples with minimum
contamination. This contamination may include contaminants in the
sampling tool itself, material from one location contaminating samples
collected at another location (sample cross-contamination), or
Earth-source microorganisms brought to the Martian surface prior to
drilling ('clean' sampling from a 'dirty' surface). Consideration should
 be given to use of materials and processes compatible with 110 -
125\u00b0C dry heat sterilization. In situ sterilization may be
explored, as well as innovative mechanical or system solutions - e.g.,
single-use sample "sleeves," or fully-integrated sample acquisition and
encapsulation systems. For a sample return mission, solutions are sought
 for sample transfer of a payload into a planetary ascent vehicle
including automated payload transfer mechanisms and Orbiting Sample (OS)
 sealing techniques. Sample Return Facility capabilities Technologies
are needed for terrestrial handling of returned samples, including
sample quarantine, biological activity and biohazard assessment,
techniques for performing sample science. Proposals should show an
understanding of one or more relevant science needs, and present a
feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA
program. Technical feasibility should be demonstrated during Phase I and
 a full capability unit of at least TRL 4 should be delivered in Phase
II. ",

sites of scientific interest on Mars, Venus, small planetary bodies, and
 the moons of Earth, Mars, Jovian and Saturnian systems. For planetary
bodies where gravity dominates, such as the Moon and Mars, many
scientifically valuable sites are accessible only via terrain that is
too difficult for state-of-the-art planetary rovers to traverse in terms
 of ground slope, rock obstacle size, plateaus, and non-cohesive soils
types. Sites include crater walls, canyons, gullies, sand dunes, and
high rock density regions. Tethered systems, non-wheeled systems, and
marsupial systems are examples of mobility technologies that are of
interest. Mars is particularly interested in fast traverse capabilities
aimed at a fetch rover that would potentially need to travel a long
distance to retrieve a sample cache deposited by a prior mission. For
small planetary bodies with micro-gravity environments, novel access
systems are desired to enable exploration and sample acquisition. Small
body missions include Comet Surface Sample Return, Cryogenic Comet
Sample Return, and asteroid Trojan Tour and Rendezvous. For surface and
subsurface sampling, advanced manipulation technologies are needed to
deploy instruments and tools from spacecraft, landers and rovers.
Technologies to enable acquisition of subsurface samples are also
needed. Technologies are needed to acquire core samples in the shallow
subsurface to about 10cm and to enable subsurface sampling in multiple
holes at least 1 - 3 meters deep through rock, regolith, or ice

seeks innovative technologies to facilitate meeting Forward and Backward
 Contamination Planetary Protection objectives especially for a
potential Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission and to facilitate Forward
Planetary Protection implementation for a potential mission to Europa.
Backward Contamination Planetary Protection deals with the possibility
that Mars (or other planetary) material may pose a biological threat to
the Earth's biosphere. This leads to a constraint that returned samples
of Mars material be contained with extraordinary robustness until they
can be tested and proved harmless or be sterilized by an accepted
method. Achieving this containment goal will require new technology for
several functions. Containment assurance requires "breaking the chain of
 contact" with Mars: the exterior of the sample container must not be
contaminated with Mars material. Also, the integrity of the containment
must be verified, the sample container and its seals must survive the
worst-case Earth impact corresponding to the candidate mission profile,
and the Earth entry vehicle (EEV) must withstand the thermal and
structural rigors of Earth atmosphere entry - all with an unprecedented
degree of confidence. Backward Contamination Planetary Protection
technologies for the following MSR functions are included in this call:
Container Design, Sealing, &amp;amp; Verification: Options for sealing
the sample container include (but are not limited to) brazing, explosive
 welding, and various types of soft seals, with sealing performed either
 on the Mars surface or in orbit. Confirmation of sealing can be
provided by observation of sealing system parameters and by leak
detection after sealing. Wireless data and power transmission may be
needed to support such leak detection technologies. Additional
containment using a flexible liner within the EEV that is sealed while
in Mars orbit has also been considered. Further validation prior to
Earth entry may also be needed. Breaking-the-Chain &amp;amp; Dust
Mitigation: Several paths have been identified that would result in Mars
 material contaminating the outside of the sealed sample container
and\/or the Earth return vehicle (ERV). Technology options for
mitigation include ejection of containment layers during ascent and
orbit and\/or capturing a contaminated "Orbiting Sample" into a clean
container on the ERV and then ejecting the capture device. Meteoroid
Protection &amp;amp; Breach Detection: Protection is required for both
the sample container and the EEV heat shield. New lightweight shielding
techniques are needed. Even with these, there may be a requirement for
technology to detect a breach of the shield or damage to the EEV.
Forward Contamination Planetary Protection technologies are desired,
particularly for Mars and Europa missions that allow sterilization of
previously non-sterilizable flight hardware by either i) dry heat
processing or ii) gamma\/e-beam irradiation. NASA also seeks to use iii)
 hydrogen peroxide vapor processes for resterilization of assembled
flight hardware elements. Proposals are invited for innovative
approaches to sterilization of flight hardware in the pre-flight
environment using this technology. Note: this call is not for novel
sterilization processes. For Europa, products and technologies are
sought that can be demonstrated to be compatible with the three
identified sterilization processes, as well as the environmental
conditions of spaceflight and the Jovian system. Candidate technologies
for the following functions and capabilities are included in this call:
Sterilization Process Compatibility: Options for proving compatibility
of novel product elements (materials, parts) with recognized spacecraft
sterilization process parameters are desired. Redesign for
Sterilization: Development of alternative solutions for spacecraft
hardware is needed where there are known sterilization process
incompatibilities. Current planning is to facilitate system-level
sterilization of spacecraft, so heat tolerant technology solutions for
sensors, seals (battery, valve), optical coatings, etc., are highly
desired. Biobarrier Technology: Demonstration of novel biobarrier and
recontamination prevention approaches for spacecraft hardware is needed
when applying one or more of these three sterilization processes.

supercomputing systems and associated operations and services. Specific
objectives are to: Decrease the barriers to entry for prospective
supercomputing users. Minimize the supercomputer user's total
time-to-solution (e.g., time to discover, understand, predict, or
design). Increase the achievable scale and complexity of computational
analysis, data ingest, and data communications. Reduce the cost of
providing a given level of supercomputing performance on NASA
applications. Enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of NASA's
supercomputing operations and services. Expected outcomes are to improve
 the productivity of NASA's supercomputing users, broaden NASA's
supercomputing user base, accelerate advancement of NASA science and
engineering, and benefit the supercomputing community through
dissemination of operational best practices. The approach of this
subtopic is to seek novel software and hardware technologies that
provide notable benefits to NASA's supercomputing users and facilities,
and to infuse these technologies into NASA supercomputing operations.
Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be
considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, NASA's high-end
computing (HEC) projects: the High End Computing Capability project at
Ames and the Scientific Computing project at Goddard. To assure maximum
relevance to NASA, funded SBIR contracts under this subtopic should
engage in direct interactions with one or both HEC projects, and with
key HEC users where appropriate. Research should be conducted to
demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and
show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration. Offerors should
demonstrate awareness of the state-of-the-art of their proposed
technology, and should leverage existing commercial capabilities and
research efforts where appropriate. Open Source software and open
standards are strongly preferred. Note that the NASA supercomputing
environment is characterized by: HEC systems operating behind a firewall
 to meet strict IT security requirements, communication-intensive
applications, massive computations requiring high concurrency, complex
computational workflows and immense datasets, and the need to support
hundreds of complex application codes - many of which are frequently
updated by the user\/developer. As a result, solutions that involve the
following must clearly explain how they would work in the NASA
environment: Grid computing, web services, client-server models,
embarrassingly parallel computations, and technologies that require
significant application re-engineering. Projects need not benefit all
NASA HEC users or application codes, but demonstrating applicability to
an important NASA discipline, or even a key NASA application code, could
 provide significant value. Specific technology areas of interest:
Efficient Computing  In spite of the rapidly increasing capability and
efficiency of supercomputers, NASA's HEC facilities cannot purchase,
power, and cool sufficient HEC resources to satisfy all user demands.
This subtopic element seeks dramatically more efficient and effective
supercomputing approaches in terms of their ability to supply increased
HEC capability or capacity per dollar and\/or per Watt for real NASA
applications. Examples include: Novel computational accelerators and
architectures. Enhanced visualization technologies. Improved algorithms
for key codes. Power-aware "Green" computing technologies and
techniques. Systems (including both hardware and software) for
data-intensive computing. Approaches to effectively manage and utilize
many-core processors including algorithmic changes, compiler techniques
and runtime systems. User Productivity Environments  The user interface
to a supercomputer is typically a command line in a text window. This
subtopic element seeks more intuitive, intelligent, user-customizable,
and integrated interfaces to supercomputing resources, enabling users to
 more completely leverage the power of HEC to increase their
productivity. Such an interface could enhance many essential
supercomputing tasks: accessing and managing resources, training,
getting services, developing codes (e.g., debugging and performance
analysis), running computations, managing files and data, analyzing and
visualizing results, transmitting data, collaborating, etc.    Cloud
Supercomputing  Cloud computing has made tremendous promises, and
demonstrated some success, for business computing. For operations,
potential benefits include: resource virtualization, incremental and
transparent provisioning, enhanced resource consolidation and
utilization, automated resource management, automated job migration, and
 increased service availability, and others. For users, potential
benefits include: out-sourced operations, on-demand resource
availability, increased service reliability, customized software
environments, a web user interface, and more. This subtopic element
seeks technologies that enable Cloud computing to be used for efficient
and effective supercomputing operations and services. ",

        "topic_name": "Fault Management Technologies",
        "description": "As science missions are given increasingly
complex goals and have more pressure to reduce operations costs, system
autonomy increases. Fault Management (FM) is one of the key components
of system autonomy. FM consists of the operational mitigations of
spacecraft failures. It is implemented with spacecraft hardware,
on-board autonomous software that controls hardware, software,
information redundancy, and ground-based software and operations
procedures. Many recent Science Mission Directorate (SMD) missions have
encountered major cost overruns and schedule slips during test and
verification of FM functions. These overruns are due to a lack of
understanding of FM functions early in the mission definition cycles,
and to FM architectures that do not provide attributes of transparency,
verifiability, fault isolation capability, or fault coverage. The NASA
FM Handbook is under development to improve the FM design, development,
verification &amp;amp; validation and operations processes. FM
approaches, architectures, and tools are needed to improve early
understanding of needed FM capabilities by project managers and FM
engineers, and to improve the efficiency of implementing and testing FM.
 Specific objectives are to: Improve ability to predict FM system
complexity and estimate development and operations costs. Enable
cost-effective FM design architectures and operations. Determine
completeness and appropriateness of FM designs and implementations.
Decrease the labor and time required to develop and test FM models and
algorithms. Improve visualization of the full FM design across hardware,
 software, and operations procedures. Determine extent of testing
required, completeness of verification planned, and residual risk
resulting from incomplete coverage. Increase data integrity between
multi-discipline tools. Standardize metrics and calculations across FM,
SE, S&amp;amp;MA and operations disciplines. Increase reliability of FM
systems. Expected outcomes are better estimation and control of FM
complexity and development costs, improved FM designs, and accelerated
advancement of FM tools and techniques. The approach of this subtopic is
 to seek the right balance between sufficient reliability and cost
appropriate to the mission type and risk posture. Successful technology
development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for
follow-on funding by, and infusion into, SMD missions. Research should
be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance
during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II prototype
demonstration. Offerors should demonstrate awareness of the
state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage
existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where appropriate.
 Specific technology in the forms listed below is needed to increase
delivery of high quality FM systems. These approaches, architectures and
 tools must be consistent with and enable the NASA FM Handbook concepts
and processes. FM design tools: System modeling and analyses
significantly contributes to the quality of FM design; however, the time
 it takes to translate system design information into system models
often decreases the value of the modeling and analysis results. Examples
 of enabling techniques and tools are modeling automation, spacecraft
modeling libraries, expedited algorithm development, sensor placement
analyses, and system model tool integration. FM visualization tools: FM
systems incorporate hardware, software, and operations mechanisms. The
ability to visualize the full FM system and the contribution of each
mechanism to protecting mission functions and assets is critical to
assessing the completeness and appropriateness of the FM design to the
mission attributes (mission type, risk posture, operations concept,
etc.). Fault trees and state transition diagrams are examples of
visualization tools that could contribute to visualization of the full
FM design. FM verification and validation tools: As complexity of
spacecraft and systems increases, the extensiveness of testing required
to verify and validate FM implementations can be resource intensive.
Automated test case development, false positive\/false negative test
tools, model verification and validation tools, and test coverage risk
assessments are examples of contributing technologies. FM Design
Architectures: FM capabilities may be implemented through numerous
system, hardware, and software architecture solutions. The FM
architecture trade space includes options such as embedded in the flight
 control software or independent onboard software; on board versus
ground-based capabilities; centralized or distributed FM functions;
sensor suite implications; integration of multiple FM techniques;
innovative software FM architectures implemented on flight processors or
 on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs); and execution in real-time
or off-line analysis post-operations. Alternative architecture choices
could help control FM system complexity and cost and could offer
solutions to transparency, verifiability, and completeness challenges.
Multi-discipline FM Interoperation: FM designers, Systems Engineering,
Safety and Mission Assurance, and Operations perform analyses and
assessments of reliabilities, failure modes and effects, sensor
coverage, failure probabilities, anomaly detection and response,
contingency operations, etc. The relationships between multi-discipline
data and analyses are inconsistent and misinterpreted. Resources are
expended either in effort to resolve disconnects in data and analyses or
 worse, reduced mission success due to failure modes that were
overlooked. Solutions that address data integrity, identification of
metrics, and standardization of data products, techniques and analyses
will reduce cost and failures. ",

and processing operations that can be inserted for integration into
on-going and future system-level development and demonstration efforts.

minimum Earth-supplied feedstock possible. There are three main areas of
 interest:  Extraterrestrial Material-Based ISRU  Methods for collection

Methods for the transfer of Mars surface material containing water at 1

state and explain material properties and water content considered in
the design, and locations on Mars where the method proposed is
applicable Use of ionic liquids for processing and extracting oxygen and
 metals from extraterrestrial material at temperatures below 200 C at
0.2 kg\/hr. Proposals must include methods for product separation and
ionic liquid reagent regeneration for subsequent processing. Development
 of reactors with dust tolerant gas-tight seals and valving to extract
and collect of water and other potential volatiles from extraterrestrial
 materials at 0.5 to 5 kg\/hr of material processing rate. Proposals
must state and explain material properties, water content, mixing

may combine material transfer with water\/volatile processing to
minimize mass and power. Proposals for processing reactor systems should
 focus on highly effective approaches to energy utilization, including
internal heat and mass transport enhancements and\/or other physical or
operational characteristics. Proposals that cover more than one material
 for consideration are of particular interest. Development of a compact,
 lightweight gas chromatograph - mass spectrometer (GC-MS) instrument
that can quantify volatile gases released by sample heating below atomic
 number 70 (of particular interest H2, He (and isotopes), CO, CO2, CH4,
H2O, N2, O2, Ar, NH3, HCN, H2S, SO2). The instrument should be designed
to be able to withstand exposure to the release of HF, HCl, or Hg that
may result from heating regolith samples to high temperatures. The
instrument should be capable of detecting 1000 ppm to 100% concentration
 of the volatiles in the gas phase. The instrument should have a clear
path to flight with a flight instrument design with a mass of less than 5
 kg not including any vacuum components required to operate in the
laboratory environment. Extraterrestrial Atmosphere Based ISRU  Devices
that collect and separate Mars atmospheric argon and nitrogen using a
standalone device or as part of carbon dioxide collection concepts at
carbon dioxide collection rates (0.5 to 2 kg CO2\/hr rate and supply
pressure at &amp;gt;15 psi for subsequent processing). Micro-channel
reactor and heat exchanger concepts for efficient processing of carbon
monoxide and carbon dioxide into water and\/or methane with hydrogen at
0.5 to 2 kg\/hr rate. Discarded Material-Based ISRU  Trash processing
reactor concepts for production of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
water, and methane from plastic trash and dried crew solid waste.
Proposals must define use of solar or electrical energy during
processing, and any reagents\/consumables. Recycling schemes for
reactants\/reagents used in the processing should be included. Highly
efficient, compact water vapor removal\/separation devices from product
gas streams is also of interest. Proposals must consider the
physical\/abrasive, mineral, and volatile\/water properties and
characteristics of the material\/resource of interest, and the gravity
environment in which collection, transfer, and processing will occur.
Concepts that can operate in micro &amp;amp; low-gravity (1\/6-g
&amp;amp; 3\/8-g), as well as multiple resources are of greater
interest. Designs that are compatible for subsequent analog,
micro\/low-g flight experiments, and ground vacuum experiments are also
of greater interest. Proposals that utilize rotating gears and actuators
 must be designed for abrasive\/dusty environmental conditions.
Proposals will be evaluated against state-of-the-art capabilities with
respect to mass, power, and process efficiency. Figures of merit include
 consumable production rate (kg\/hr), production energy efficiency (kg
produced\/ hr per KWe), and extraction\/reactant recovery efficiency. ",

 Audio",
        "description": "Future EVAs need advances in radio technologies,
 including antennas, tunable RF front-ends, and power amplifiers;
low-power cameras; more accurate, reliable, and packaged core
temperature, CO2, and biomedical sensors; user-friendly, minimally
invasive crewmember information displays; and technologies that provide
improvements in speech quality, listening quality and listening effort
for in-helmet aural and vocal communications. Progress in these
technologies will help ensure reliable communications, crew safety and
comfort, and work efficiency and autonomy. The focus of this subtopic is
 to advance future EVA lightweight, compact, low-power technologies in
five primary areas: radios, sensors, displays, cameras, and suit audio.
The expectation for all of these EVA areas is that a report
demonstrating the concept, requirements, design, and technical
feasibility will be delivered at the end of Phase I, and that a working
and fully functional device will be delivered at the end of Phase II.
The next-generation EVA radio needs to fulfill multiple functions while
satisfying stringent requirements on size, weight and power (SWaP)
consumption in the ISM S-band (2.4 - 2.483 GHz) and Ka-band
(approximately 26 GHz). Ideally, eventual radio SwAP reductions would
result in approximately 115 cubic inches, 3.5 - 5.5 pounds, and 15 watts
 total power consumption, respectively. Next-generation EVA radios will
need to support multiple comm loops and point-to-point EVA comm.,
receive caution and warning messages from the vehicle and other EVA
crew, receive, store, and display voice\/text messaging to handle comm
delays. Moreover, next-generation EVA antenna systems that effectively
present uniform coverage around the suit are needed. Likewise, the
next-generation EVA radio needs RF front-end architectures capable of
presenting baseband or IF signals to waveform processing hardware in
multiple bands. Radiation-hardened-by-design transceiver technologies
improving upon current Single Event Upset tolerant approaches, along
with cognitive technologies, are needed for future EVA exploration to
Near Earth Asteroids and beyond. In addition, advances in tunable
technology that permit high Q factor, minimum insertion losses, and
excellent linearity are desirable at the given S- and Ka-band Gigahertz
frequencies for agility. The next-generation EVA radios will need to
support voice, telemetry, and standard\/high definition video data flows
 (up to 20 Mbps); ensure rapid upgrades via scalable, open, and modular
architectures; and, advance power aware technologies to optimize
efficiency, conserve EVA battery lifetime power, and prolong duration of
 EVA operations. Finally, no matter what type of transceiver
architecture is used in the next-generation EVA radio, the power
amplifier is always a key component to enable new functionality, and to
minimize the power consumption of the whole radio. Current amplifiers
suffer from one or many of the following drawbacks: a) insufficient
power added efficiency, b) insufficient linearity performance and
incompatibility with modern modulation signals, and c) incompatible with
 silicon CMOS technology. Most of the commercial PAs are based on III-V
GaAs material system, which is more expensive compared to the CMOS
fabrication processes. Additionally, the incompatibility with silicon
CMOS technology makes it impossible to realize a fully integrated
radio-on-a-chip system. Consequently, the implemented radio with the
existing power amplifiers requires much more SwAP and higher fabrication
 costs. Advances are needed in the efficiency and linearity of power
amplifiers for next-generation EVA radio applications. Crew health and
suit monitoring require advancement of lightweight CO2, biomedical
(heart rate, blood OX, EKG) and core temperature sensors with reduced
size, increased reliability, and greater packaging flexibility.
Consequently, technologies are needed to provide high accuracy, low
mass, and low-power sensors that measure flow rate, pressure,
temperature, and relative humidity or dew point. All sensors must
operate in a low pressure 100% O2 environment with high humidity and may
 be exposed to liquid condensate. Because missions must be designed with
 appropriate radiation shielding and adjusted to keep the radiation
doses within tolerable limits, real-time, accurate, instantaneous and
integrated radiation dose measurements and readout are needed such as
novel dosimeter sensors. Given sufficient warning, astronauts can move
to a more shielded part of the space vehicle and lessen dose impact. As
cosmic rays impinge upon the vehicle leaving the magnetosphere, sensors
are needed to determine the type of radiation and dose as well as reduce
 the potential risk of biological tissue damage. Future EVAs need a
user-friendly and minimally invasive crewmember information display
device that provides significant task efficiency improvement for a broad
 range of EVA tasks. Current Head-Mounted Display and Near-to-Eye
display technologies are a non-starter for EVA, because the display must
 be mechanically decoupled from the user's head in order to improve crew
 safety, comfort, and prevent display misalignment. This in turn makes
for more difficult specifications for the eyebox (tolerance to
misalignment before image goes out of focus), field of view (angle of
the image created by the optics), and eye relief (working distance from
the eye to the last optical element). Additionally, current
Helmet-Mounted Display technologies are challenged in EVA applications
due to geometric constraints within the helmet, and future display
technologies must ensure suit displays can operate outside the suit
protection in thermal, radiation, and vacuum environments as well as
internally without imposing ignition hazards due to 100% oxygen
environment. Key performance parameters (targets) include: Graphical
Data Presentation: SXGA @ 40 deg FOV (possibly biocular); Decoupled from
 User's Head - Large Eyebox: 100 mm x 100mm x 50mm (D); Sunlight
Readability: 500 fL inside visor, 1800 fL outside visor (&amp;gt;10 to 1
 contrast). Future EVAs need to support high definition motion and high
resolution imagery with ultra compact, low-power HD cameras and low loss
 compressed digital data output for RF transmissions and\/or IP
networks. Hemispherical and dynamic cameras are desired, where
hemispherical cameras take video views of a crewmember (360 degrees),
distorting those views thru optics and then undistorting those views via
 software on the ground to pan\/zoom for total situational awareness.
Dynamic cameras can take stills and motion in variable bandwidths,
capture image based on link quality, change frame rates, interfaced to
gigabit Ethernet and in a rad-tolerant package with dynamically
reconfigure compression core(s) and common 'back-end' interfaces. The
space suit environment presents a unique challenge for capturing and
transmitting speech communications to and from a crewmember. The in-suit
 acoustic environment is characterized by highly reflective surfaces,
causing high levels of reverberation, as well as spacesuit-unique noise
fields; and wide swings of static pressure levels. Due to these factors,
 the quality of speech delivered to and from the inside of a spacesuit
helmet can be low and can have a negative effect on inbound and outbound
 speech intelligibility. The traditional approach to overcome the
challenges of the spacesuit acoustic environment is to use a
skullcap-based system of microphones and speakers. Cap-based systems are
 less successful, however, in attenuating high noise levels generated
outside the spacesuit, and many logistical issues exist for head-mounted
 caps (e.g., crewmembers are not able to adjust the skullcap, headset or
 microphone booms during EVA operations, interference between the
protuberances of the cap and other devices, comfort, hygiene, proper
positioning and dislocation, and wire fatigue and blind mating of the
connectors, multiple cap sizes to accommodate anthropometric variations
in crew heads). NASA is seeking technologies in support of improvements
in speech intelligibility, speech quality, listening quality and
listening effort for in-helmet aural and vocal communications. The
specific focus of this SBIR subtopic is on improving the interface
between crewmember and the acoustic pickup (microphones) and generation
(speaker) systems. Devices are sought to improve or resolve acoustic,
physical and technical problems (listed above) that have been associated
 with skullcap-mounted speakers and microphones, or allow for the
elimination of skullcap-mounted speakers and microphones. In particular,
 voice communications systems are sought that have provided crewmembers
with adequate speech intelligibility over background noise within, and
external to, the spacesuit. Overall system performance must provide Mean
 Opinion Score (MOS) for Listening Quality (Lq) and Listening Effort
(Le) of 3.9 or greater, or Articulation Index (AI) of .7 or better or
90% Intelligibility in the crewmember's native language for both inbound
 and outbound speech communication. Specific technologies of interest
include, but are not limited to: acoustic modeling of the in-suit
acoustic environment, including the ability to model structure-borne
vibration in helmet and suit structures as well as transduction to and
from the acoustic medium; low-mass, low-volume, low-distortion,
space-qualified speakers with low variation in sensitivity with static
pressure. Changes in speaker sensitivity should be less than 2 dB over
the speech band with changes in static pressure between 3 and 18 psia;
low-mass, ultra-low-volume (&amp;lt; 1mm^3), low-distortion low noise
microphones that are capable of being space-qualified noise canceling
microphones with low variation in sensitivity with static pressure.
Changes in microphone sensitivity should be less than 2 dB over the
speech band with changes in static pressure between 3 and 18 psia; and,
attenuation of external noise by passive hearing protection that is
comfortable for crewmembers during extended use. ",

lightweight-structure technologies that would be viable solutions to
high packaging efficiency and increasing the usable primary pressurized

fabrication and manufacturing of lightweight structures focuses on the
development of metallic alloys and hybrid materials, processing and
fabrication technologies related to near-net shape forming. The goal is
to reduce structural weight, assembly steps, and minimize welds,
resulting in increased reliability and reduced cost. Research should
evaluate material compatibility with forming methods and establish
fundamental microstructure\/processing\/property correlations to guide
full-scale fabrication. Laboratory scale test methods are needed to
accurately simulate the deformation modes experienced in large-scale
manufacturing. Polymer matrix composite (PMC) materials have been
identified as a critical need for launch and in-space vehicles. The
reduction of structural mass translates directly to additional
performance, increased payload mass and reduced cost. PMC materials are
also critical for other structures, such as cryogenic propellant tanks.

spaceflight missions. Smart, lightweight, low-volume, and stand-alone
sensor systems should reduce the complexities of standard wires and

 the moon or Mars, and nuclear electric propulsion systems (NEP) for
Mars cargo transport. A non-nuclear system ground test in thermal-vacuum
 is planned by NASA to validate technologies required to transfer
reactor heat, convert the heat into electricity, reject waste heat,
process the electrical output, and demonstrate overall system
performance. The primary goals for the early systems are low cost, high
reliability, and long life. Proposals are solicited that could help
supplement or augment the planned NASA system test. Specific areas for
development include: 900 K NaK heat transport loops, including pumps and
 accumulators. 10 kWe-class Stirling and Brayton power conversion
devices. 450 K water heat rejection loops, including pumps and
accumulators. Composite radiator panels with embedded water heat pipes.
Radiator deployment mechanisms and structures. Radiation tolerant
materials and components. 120 V - 1k V power management and distribution
 (PMAD) for high power DC and AC systems, 1 kW to 100 kW respectively.
The NASA system test is expected to provide the foundation for later
systems in the multi-hundred kilowatt or megawatt range that utilize
higher operating temperatures, alternative materials, and advanced
components to improve system performance. For the later systems,
specific power will be a key performance metric with goals of 30 kg\/kWe
 at 100 kWe and 10 kg\/kWe at 1 MWe. Possible mission applications
include large NEP cargo vehicles, NEP piloted vehicles, and
surface-based resource production plants. In addition to low cost, high
reliability, and long life, the later systems should address the low
system specific mass goal. Proposals are solicited that identify novel
system concepts and methods to reduce mass and increase power output.
Specific areas for development include: High temperature reactor fuels
and structural materials. Reactor heat transport technologies for 1100 K
 and above. 100 kWe-class Brayton and Rankine power conversion devices.

        "description": "The Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) Technology
 includes developments in Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) and
Supersonic Retropropulsion (SRP). The Thermal Protection System (TPS)
protects a spacecraft from the severe heating encountered during
hypersonic flight through a planetary atmosphere. Supersonic
Retropropulsion has been identified in past studies to be enabling for
putting human-scale payloads on the surface of Mars. Thermal Protection
Systems: In general, there are two classes of TPS: reusable and
ablative. Typically, reusable TPS applications are limited to relatively
 mild entry environments like that of Space Shuttle. No change in the
mass or properties of the TPS material results from entry; a significant
 amount of energy is re-radiated from the heated surface and the
remainder is conducted into the TPS material. Ablative TPS materials, in
 contrast, accommodate high heating rates and heat loads through phase
change and mass loss. All NASA planetary entry probes to date have used
ablative TPS. Most ablative TPS materials are reinforced composites
employing organic resins as binders. In comparison to reusable TPS
materials, the interaction of ablative TPS materials with the
surrounding gas environment is much more complex as there are many more
mechanisms to accommodate the entry heating. Better performing ablative
TPS is needed to satisfy requirements of the most severe missions, e.g.,
 Mars Landing from 8 km\/s entry and Mars Sample Return with 12-15 km\/s
 Earth entry. Beyond the improvement needed in ablative TPS materials,
more demanding future missions such as large payload missions to Mars
will require novel entry system designs that consider different vehicle
shapes, deployable or inflatable configurations and integrated
approaches of TPS materials with the entry system sub-structure.
Supersonic Retropropulsion: When decelerating a vehicle to land on a
body with an atmosphere, it is generally more mass-effective to take
advantage of the natural environment and use atmospheric drag to its
full potential, rather than use a propulsion system. This approach works
 well at Earth where the atmosphere is dense, but the trade is less
conclusive at Mars. Recent studies for landing human-scale payloads on
Mars (40-60 mt) have shown that using Supersonic Retropropulsion is
probably enabling for this challenge. The scale of an aerodynamic
decelerator employed in this flight regime would be very large, and
presents issues with payload extraction and deployment in the short time
 available. Since a terminal propulsion system is already needed for
these large landers, starting the engines earlier in the descent profile
 is an attractive solution. Aerodynamic challenges with this approach
center around the interaction of the engine plumes with the oncoming
supersonic flowfield, and what instabilities this causes for the system.
 Controlled wind tunnel testing with high-fidelity instrumentation and
subsequent modeling of these complex flowfields is key to predicting
system behavior. The SRP system will also need to be flight-tested in a
relevant environment as part of the technology maturation.
Cost-effective, feasible concepts and vehicle configurations for Earth
flight tests are needed, to prove feasibility in the near term.",

including: development of acreage (main body, non-leading edge)
materials, adhesives, joints, penetrations, and seals. Three classes of
materials will be required: One class of materials, for Mars aerocapture

will need to survive a dual heating exposure, with the first at heat
fluxes of 400-500 W\/cm2 (primarily convective) and integrated heat

 atm and improve on the state-of-the-art areal mass of 1.0 g\/cm2

convective) and integrated heat loads of 10 kJ\/cm2 and the second at

 Mars return, will need to survive heat fluxes of 1500-2500 W\/cm2, with
 radiation contributing up to 75% of that flux, and integrated heat

surface recession diagnostics tools are needed for flight systems to
provide better traceability from the modeling and design tools to actual
 performance. The resultant data will lead to higher fidelity design
tools, risk reduction, decreased heat shield mass and increases in
direct payload. The heat flux sensors should be accurate within 20%,
surface recession diagnostic sensors should be accurate within 10%, and
any temperature sensors should be accurate within 5% of actual values.
Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE) tools are sought to verify design
requirements are met during manufacturing and assembly of the heat
shield, e.g., verifying that anisotropic materials have been installed
in their proper orientation, that the bondline as well as the TPS
materials have the proper integrity and are free of voids or defects.
Void and\/or defect detection requirements will depend upon the
materials being inspected. Typical internal void detection requirements
are on the order of 6-mm, and bondline defect detection requirements are
 on the order of 25.4-mm by 25.4-mm by the thickness of the adhesive.
Advances are sought in ablation modeling, including radiation,
convection, gas surface interactions, pyrolysis, coking, and charring.

composition in each layer). Consideration of the non-equilibrium states

telemedicine, smart phones provide a robust, reconfigurable platform
capable of communications, computations and various functions (i.e.,
imaging, video, power source, signal processing) that will continue to
expand at an accelerated pace. By leveraging this technology, NASA seeks
 to exploit the smart phone for blood-based diagnostics to develop an
analytical device that can determine basic metabolic (Chem8), blood gas
(PaO2, PaCO2, SaO2, HCO3, pH), cardiac (troponin I, CK-MB, total
cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VDL, triglyecerides and lipoproteins) and
liver\/renal (total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ALP, ALT, AST) panels.
These panels are representative of the operational and research
requirements for space exploration related point of care diagnostics.
The diagnostic device must interface to a smart phone that will drive
the device's electronics and\/or optics; or use the built-in features of
 the phone to interrogate the diagnostic device. The described
diagnostic component is to be no larger than the phone itself. The
microfluidic device must also be reusable or extremely compact if
disposable, and minimize reagent consumption. Other requirements to
consider are analytical times in two minutes or less, strategies for
operational capability up to 144 hours on battery power and a long
shelf-life (&amp;gt; 36 months). The Phase I effort will seek to
demonstrate the feasibility of one diagnostic panel in the smart phone
format. The Phase II effort will demonstrate at least two of the above
stated panels in an analytical component that interfaces to a cell
phone, and provides a path towards FDA approval or similar. NASA

development that leads to innovative new technologies and methods, or
significant improvements in existing technologies, for in-flight hazard
avoidance and mitigation. Technologies may take the form of tools,

and devices. A key objective of the NASA Aviation Safety Program is to
support the research of technology, systems, and methods that will
facilitate transformation of the National Airspace System to Next
Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) (information available at
 www.jpdo.gov). The general approach to the development of airborne
sensors for NextGen is to encourage the development of multi-use,
adaptable, and effective sensors that will have a strong benefit to
safety. The greatest impact will result from improved sensing capability
 in the terminal area, where higher density and more reliable operations
 are required for NextGen. Under this subtopic, proposals are invited
that explore new and improved sensors and sensor systems for the
detection and monitoring of hazards to aircraft before they are
encountered. The scope of this subtopic does not include human factors
and development of human interfaces, including displays and alerts,
except where explicitly requested in association with special topics.
Primary emphasis is on airborne applications, but in some cases the
development of ground-based sensor technology may be supported.
Approaches that use multiple sensors in combination to improve hazard
detection and quantification of hazard levels are also of interest. At
this time, there are some areas of particular interest to NASA, and
these are described below. They are provided as encouragement but not
intended to exclude other proposals that fit this subtopic. These areas
of interest include two specific hazards to aircraft and specific
advancements in fundamental radar technology. The interest in radar
technology can be considered to be independent of the interest in the
two hazards. While NASA is interested in all aviation hazards, wake
vortices and turbulence are of particular interest. Proposals associated
 with remote sensing investigations addressing these hazards are
encouraged. This emphasis is not intended to discourage proposals
targeting other or additional hazards such as reduced visibility,
terrain, airborne obstacles, volcanic ash, convective weather,
lightning, gust fronts, cross winds, and wind shear. Airborne detection
of wake vortices is considered challenging due to the fact that
detection must be possible in nearly all weather conditions, in order to
 be practical, and because of the size and nature of the phenomena.
Proposals are encouraged for the development of novel coherent and
direct detection lidar systems and associated components that allow
accurate meteorological wind and aerosol measurements suitable for wake
vortex characterization. Lidar development includes, but is not limited
to, novel transceiver architectures, efficient signal processing
methodologies, wake processing algorithms and real time data reduction
and display schemes. Improvements in size, weight, range, system
efficiency, sensitivity, and reliability based on emerging technologies
are desired. NASA has made a major investment in the development of new
and enhanced technologies to enable detection of turbulence to improve
aviation safety. Progress has been made in efforts to quantify hazard
levels from convectively induced turbulence events and to make these
quantitative assessments available to civil and commercial aviation.
NASA is interested in expanding these prior efforts to take advantage of
 the newly developing turbulence monitoring technologies, particularly
those focused on clear air turbulence (CAT). NASA welcomes proposals
that explore the methods, algorithms and quantitative assessment of
turbulence for the purpose of increasing aviation safety and augmenting
currently available data in support of NextGen operations. In order to
detect and\/or discriminate some meteorological hazards, future radars
will need multi-frequency and\/or polarimetric capabilities. NASA seeks
new system\/component designs and hazard detection applications for
airborne weather radars based upon extending the current design to
incorporate multi-frequencies and\/or polarimetric capabilities. In
addition, the current generation of weather radar is fundamentally
limited by its ability to scan the airspace; consequently, NASA is
seeking novel designs and enhancements to produce electronically scanned
 antennas\/radars.",

encounters with hazardous in-flight conditions and the mitigation of
their effects when they do occur. Under this subtopic, proposals are
invited that explore new and dramatically improved technologies related

supercooled liquid water clouds and flight into regions of high ice
crystal density. With these emphases in mind, products and technologies
that can be made affordable and capable of retrofit into the current

sought. Areas of interest include, but are not limited
to:&amp;nbsp;Non-destructive digitization of ice accretions on wind
tunnel wing models. NASA has a need for methods to digitize ice shapes
with rough external surfaces and internal voids as can occur with
accretions on highly swept wing. Current methods based upon scanning
with line-of-sight optical digitization methods have been found
inadequate for these ice shapes.New instruments are needed utilizing
innovative concepts to measure ice-crystal\/liquid water mixed phase
clouds in ground test facilities and in flight. Cloud properties of
interest include: crystal\/droplet temperature, material phase, particle
 size, speed, cloud liquid-water content, ice-water content, air
temperature, and humidity. Non-intrusive measurement techniques capable
of providing the spatial distribution of these properties across an
engine duct with a diameter of at least 3 feet are particularly of
interest.New instruments or measurement techniques are also needed for
the detailed study of the ice accretion process on wing surfaces and
internal engine components. Properties of particular interest are heat
transfer, accretion extent, and ice density. The measurement of these
properties needs to be non-interfering.",

Operating under LOC Conditions",
        "description": "Validation of future complex integrated systems
designed to ensure flight safety under off-nominal conditions associated
 with aircraft loss of control is a significant challenge. Future
systems will ensure vehicle flight safety by integrating vehicle health
management functions, resilient control functions, flight safety
assessment and prediction functions, and crew interface and variable
autonomy functions. Each of these functions is characterized by
algorithmic diversity that must be addressed in the validation process.
Vehicle health management involves diagnostic and prognostic algorithms
that utilize stochastic decision-based reasoning and extensive
information processing and data fusion. Resilient control functions can
involve adaptive control algorithms that utilize time-varying parameters
 and\/or hybrid system switching. Flight safety management may involve
diagnostic and prognostic reasoning algorithms as well as control
theoretic algorithms. Crew interface functions involve displays that are
 human-factors-based and require information processing and reasoning,
and variable autonomy will require assessment and reasoning algorithms.
Onboard modeling functions will involve system identification algorithms
 and databases. Normal operating conditions of the future may extend
beyond current-day operational limits. Moreover, safe operation under
off-nominal conditions that could lead to loss-of-control events will be
 a focus of the system design. In particular, operation under abnormal
flight conditions, external hazards and disturbances, adverse onboard
conditions, and key combinations of these conditions will be a major
part of the operational complexity required for future safety-critical
systems. Future air transportation systems must also be considered under
 operational complexity, such as requirements for dense all-weather
operations, self separation of aircraft, and mixed capabilities of
aircraft operating in the same airspace, including current and future
vehicle configurations as well as piloted and autonomous vehicles.
System validation is a confirmation that the algorithms are performing
the intended function under all possible operating conditions. The
validation process must be capable of identifying potentially
problematic regions of operation (and their boundaries) and exposing
system limitations - particularly for operation under off-nominal and
hazardous conditions related to loss of control. New methods, metrics,
and software tools must be established for algorithms that cannot be
thoroughly evaluated using existing methods. Innovative research
proposals are sought to address any of the following areas: Analytical
Validation Methods. Predictive Capability Assessment Methods. Real-Time
(or Run-Time) Validation Methods. Analytical validation methods are
comprised of a set of analytical methods and tools that facilitate the
accurate prediction of system properties under various operating and
off-nominal conditions. A wide variety of analytical methods will be
needed to evaluate stability and performance of various and dissimilar
system functions, robustness to adverse and abnormal conditions, and
reliability under errors, faults, failures, and damage. These methods
and software tools will be utilized offline and prior to implementation
in representative avionics system software and hardware. These methods
will enable analysis under a wide range of conditions, and be used to
facilitate nonlinear simulation-based and experimental evaluations under
 selected potentially problematic conditions in order to expose system
deficiencies and limitations over a very large operational space.
Analytical methods and tools applicable to determining stability,
performance, robustness, and reliability of nonlinear, time-varying,
and\/or hybrid systems involving control theoretic,
diagnostic\/prognostic, and\/or reasoning systems are sought. Predictive
 capability assessment is an evaluation of the validity and level of
confidence that can be placed in the validation process and results
under nominal and off-nominal conditions (and their associated
boundaries). The need for this evaluation arises from the inability to
fully evaluate these technologies under actual loss-of-control
conditions. A detailed disclosure is required of model, simulation, and
emulation validity for the off-nominal conditions being considered in
the validation, interactions that have been neglected, assumptions that
have been made, and uncertainties associated with the models and data.
Cross-correlations should be utilized between analytical, simulation and
 ground test, and flight test results in order to corroborate the
results and promote efficiency in covering the very large space of
operational and off-nominal conditions being evaluated. The level of
confidence in the validation process and results must be established for
 subsystem technologies as well as the fully integrated system. This
includes an evaluation of error propagation effects across subsystems,
and an evaluation of integrated system effectiveness in mitigating
off-nominal conditions and preventing cascading errors, faults, and
failures across subsystems. Metrics for performing this evaluation are
also needed. Uncertainty-based and\/or statistical-based methods and
tools that enable the determination of level of confidence in the
validation of uncertain systems operating under extreme conditions are
sought. Real-time (or run-time) validation methods are needed for the
onboard monitoring of crucial system properties whose violation could
compromise safety of flight. These properties might include closed-loop
stability, robustness margins, or underlying theoretical assumptions
that must not be violated. This information could be used as part of a
real-time safety-of-flight assessment system for the vehicle. Real-time
methods and software tools are sought that enable onboard validation of
nonlinear, time-varying, and reasoning systems. ",

the level of the national airspace. The vastness of this data means that
 data mining methods must be efficient and scalable so that they can
return results quickly. Additionally, much of this data will be
distributed among multiple systems. Data mining methods that can operate
 on the distributed data directly are critical because centralizing
large volumes of data is typically impractical. However, these methods
must be provably able to return the same results as what a comparable
method would return if the data could be centralized because this is a
critical part of verifying and validating these algorithms, which is
important for aviation safety applications. Additionally, algorithms
that can learn in an online fashion---can learn from new data in
incremental fashion without having to re-learn from the old data---will
be important to allow deployed algorithms to update themselves as the
national airspace evolves. The data is also heterogeneous: it consists
of text data (e.g., aviation safety reports), discrete sequences (e.g.,
pilot switches, phases of flight), continuous time-series data (e.g.,
flight-recorded data), radar track data, and others. Data mining methods

efficiently learn from vast historical time-series datasets (at least 10
 TB) that are heterogeneous (contain continuous, discrete, and\/or text
data). Distributed data-driven algorithms that provably return the same

comfortably for 48 hours. Maintains signal integrity at clinical quality
 (meets or exceeds ANSI\/AAMI EC11 Standard for Diagnostic

        "description": "The purpose of the NASA Advanced Food Technology
 Project is to develop, evaluate and deliver food technologies for human
 centered spacecraft that will support crews on long duration missions
beyond low-Earth orbit. Safe, nutritious, acceptable, and varied
shelf-stable foods with a shelf life of 3 - 5 years will be required to
support the crew during these exploration missions. Concurrently, the
food system must efficiently balance appropriate vehicle resources such
as mass, volume, water, air, waste, power, and crew time. Refrigeration
and freezing require dispensable resource utilization, so NASA
provisions consist solely of shelf stable foods. Stability is achieved
by thermal or irradiative processing to kill the microorganisms in the
food or drying to prevent viability of the microorganisms. These methods
 do impact the micronutrients within the food substrate. Environmental
factors (such as moisture ingress and oxidation) are also capable of
compromising the nutrient content over the shelf life of the food. Since
 the food system is the designated source of nutrition to the crew, a
significant loss in nutrient availability could significantly jeopardize
 the health and performance of the crew. Optimal nutritional content of
the food for up to five years will ensure that the food can support crew
 performance and help protect their bodies from deficiencies that cause
disease. Vitamin content in NASA foods, such as Vitamin C, Vitamin A,
thiamin, and folic acid, is degraded during processing and as the
product ages in storage. The goal is to develop a system that protects
the vitamins from this degradation at ambient temperatures over a five
year duration. Possible technologies that could be investigated to
protect food ingredients from biological and chemical degradation of
components over time include nanoscale technologies (e.g.,
encapsulation), biosensors, novel food ingredients, and
controlled-release systems. Technologies or systems that could aid in
increasing the bioavailability of the nutrients should also be
considered. Phase I Requirements: Phase I should concentrate on the
scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of the
proposed innovation resulting in a feasibility report and concept,
complete with analyses. NASA Deliverable: A system which will result in
higher nutrient content in shelf stable foods. ",

        "description": "During the last 30 years, dramatic social,
economic and technological changes have occurred in many rural areas in
the United States.&amp;nbsp; Although farming continues to be an
important source of income, most of rural America is moving from an
agrarian to post-agrarian economy.&amp;nbsp; The results of this
transformation have been uneven across the rural landscape.&amp;nbsp;
Some communities are facing economic decline and rural exodus, while in
other communities, especially those in areas near large urban centers or
 rich in natural amenities, economic and population growth have
accelerated.&amp;nbsp; Even in rural communities where economic growth
and population have grown, some have become more vulnerable to disasters
 caused by human action and\/or climate changes.&amp;nbsp; Many other
communities are plagued by limited access to good schools, food, and
health services.&amp;nbsp; As a result, despite decades of intervention
and billions of dollars in public investment, many rural residents are
unable to utilize important government services and new scientific
information that can help improve their quality of life; have higher
food insecurity and childhood obesity rates;&amp;nbsp; lack the required
 entrepreneurship and workforce skills to take advantage of emerging
economic opportunities&amp;nbsp; (e.g., climate&amp;nbsp; change
mitigation, safe food processing and marketing, etc);&amp;nbsp; and are
hampered by insufficient modern&amp;nbsp; infrastructure to rapidly
benefit from growing public and private sector investment.Applications
may be submitted for the development of new technology, or for the
utilization of existing technology, that address important economic and
social development issues or problems in rural America.&amp;nbsp; The
applications need not be centered on agriculture, but may be focused on
any area that has the potential to provide significant benefits to rural
 Americans. All applications should explicitly discuss the specific
rural problem or opportunity that will be examined and how this
technology will successfully address the problem or opportunity.
Applications submitted must include an objective to assess the impacts
of the proposed project on the environment or the socio-economic
development of rural areas.&amp;nbsp;To meet these identified problems
and opportunities of rural development, the long-term (10 year) goal for
 this program is to develop and commercialize new technology, products,
processes and services that will: (i) enhance the efficiency and equity
of public and private investment in rural communities; (ii) build a
diversified workforce to meet the needs of the present and for the
future; (iii) enhance resilience to both natural and human disasters;
and (iv) enhance economic vitality of rural communities and, in turn,
reduce rural poverty.FY 2012 Research Priorities:Examples of appropriate

housing designs; improved health care delivery; appropriate
transportation and communication technologies and services; and
marketing of new information and
technologies.2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Development of technologies and services that protect or enhance the
environment while promoting economic development.&amp;nbsp; Topics may
include technologies and services that promote rural tourism, protect
the ecosystem, conserve energy, develop alternative energy sources such
as wind and solar energy (excluding biofuels),
etc.3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Reducing the
vulnerabilities of rural communities from hazards (excluding intentional
 acts such as terrorism).&amp;nbsp; Procedures are needed to make rural
communities more sustainable to natural or unintentional hazards such as
 food-borne illnesses, food contamination, droughts, hurricanes, etc.,

        "description": "\n    \n    \n    \n        It is anticipated
that innovative and improved alcohol sensors would be useful in a
variety of situations including, but not limited to, clinical\n
monitoring, forensics and human or animal research. Specific sensor
characteristics would complement their intended use. This applies to\n
      characteristics such as sampling frequency, degree of accuracy,
data storage capacity and data transmission frequency.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        Depending on their intended purpose and use, alcohol
sensors may be augmented with additional information such as other
physiological measurements or\n        geospatial determinations.
Devices need to be compatible with human comfort, and devices to be worn
 for weeks or months may present particular\n        challenges. Since
alcohol readings are likely to be baseline most of the time, these
sensing devices generally require ways to monitor contact and\n
readiness to record. Moreover, where necessary, measurement fidelity
should be robust to subject's activities including active efforts at
tampering.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        The mode of data storage
will need to conform to power limitations and strategies for data
transmission which may require telemetry.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
   In addition to alcohol monitoring and data transmission this program
also includes the opportunity to develop appropriate data analysis
systems.\n        Examples include: estimating blood alcohol
concentrations, reconstructing patterns of alcohol consumption, and
monitoring large numbers of devices to\n        identify significant,
but infrequent, events while minimizing false positives.\n    \n    \n

reports and literature reviews point to the continuing need for
improving adherence to therapeutic regimens. Adherence rates vary\n
   considerably across diseases and treatments, measuring instruments,
and populations, with rates ranging from 30% to 60% in many instances.
The reasons\n        for non-adherence are multifaceted. Health-care

need to take into account institutional,\n        system, situational,
interpersonal, and personal factors as well as the characteristics of
the illness or condition and of the treatment regimen. While\n
extensive research exists and successful techniques have been

alcohol\n        consumption and of alcohol-induced tissue injury. High
throughput approaches using genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics,
proteomics, metabolomics,\n        lipomics, or glycomics are
encouraged. Biomarker signatures may be composed of multiple genes,
RNAs, microRNAs, proteins, or metabolites, or\n        combinations
thereof. Furthermore, alterations in lipid, lipoprotein, or glycoprotein
 profiles may reflect the metabolic effects of alcohol exposure\n
 and may be considered as potentially predictive. Biomarker signatures
that address multiple aspects of alcohol consumption and alcohol damage
are\n        needed. These include, but are not limited to:\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        A.    Biomarkers of long-term alcohol consumption.
 A biomarker panel reflecting the cumulative intake of alcohol over a
period of months or more would\n        be of great diagnostic use, both
 in terms of recognizing problem drinking and in terms of the potential
for organ damage.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        B.    Biomarkers that
 distinguish between binge, acute, moderate and chronic drinking. Each
of these modes of alcohol intake has different\n        physiological
effects. The ability to distinguish dose and timing of drinking would
enhance clinicians\u2019 ability to design appropriate treatment and\n
      intervention protocols.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        C.
Biomarkers of compliance after withdrawal. Biomarker signatures in this
class would be comprised of metabolic products that decrease rapidly
upon\n        abstinence, in contrast to the characteristics of
biomarkers that reflect cumulative alcohol. The ability to detect
relapse accurately will support\n        successful behavioral
interventions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        D.    Biomarker
signatures of alcohol-induced organ damage. The damage due to alcohol
consumption is likely to be organ-specific, with signatures\n
reflecting alcohol-induced damage likely to be different for heart
damage, liver damage, encephalopathy, a dysregulated immune system, or
other alcohol\n        target.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        E.
Biomarker signatures of familial risk factors for alcoholism. Early
identification of subjects predisposed to alcoholism will allow for
early\n        intervention, and allow the subject to make informed
decisions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Kathy Jung, Ph.D.\n    \n

        "topic_name": "Clinical Testing of Biochemical Markers",
        "description": "\n    \n    \n    \n        The development of
effective biochemical markers represents a powerful means for early
diagnosis and treatment of alcohol dependent\/abuse patients and\n
  for the identification of individuals who have a predisposition for
alcoholism. There are two different types of biochemical markers: trait
markers and\n        state markers.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
Trait biomarkers have the ability to detect inborn characteristics of
individuals who are vulnerable for alcoholism. This type of marker would
 be\n        invaluable for screening of high-risk individuals (e.g.,
children of alcoholics) and targeting them with preventive or early
treatment interventions.\n        In addition, trait markers might
assist practitioners in identifying subpopulations of alcoholics who may
 need different treatment strategies. An ideal\n        trait marker
should have several features. First, it should display validity in
detecting people susceptible to alcoholism, particularly before the\n
     onset of alcoholism or during periods of stable abstinence. Second,
 it should be easily and reliably measured. Third, it should be specific
 for\n        alcoholism only and not affected by other medical or
psychiatric disorders or drugs. Since alcoholism is a complex disease,
it is likely that more than\n        one type of gene and protein exist
as trait marker.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        State markers or
markers of alcohol consumption serve several important purposes. First,
they can assist physicians in diagnosing individuals with\n
chronic drinking problems, particularly patients who deny excessive
drinking. Moreover, they may also identify individuals in early stages
of heavy\n        drinking, thus avoiding the long-term medical,
psychological, and social consequences of chronic alcoholism. Second,
state biomarkers can aid in the\n        diagnosis and treatment of
other diseases (liver diseases, pancreatitis, and cardiovascular
diseases) that were, at least, caused by excessive\n        drinking.
Third, they are useful in alcohol treatment and prevention programs.
Since the goal of many of programs is abstinence, monitoring relapse
is\n        important in gauging success. Last, state biomarkers are
important in clinical alcohol trials. Although self-reports have become
more sophisticated and\n        valid (e.g., Timeline Followback), they
still rely on accurate reporting. These new and reliable biomarkers
could then be used to confirm the\n        self-report. Several
biomarkers with certain limitations are currently in use including
carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT), gamma-glutamyl\n
transferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). New state
markers need to be\n        developed that incorporate the following
attributes: validity, reliability, stability, cost, practicability,
acceptability, and transportability.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
Areas that may be of interest to small businesses include, but are not
limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        A.    Develop and evaluate

 mechanisms of ethanol action in the brain are mediated by
time-dependent neurochemical events in multiple brain regions. Despite\n
        great progress in identifying ethanol\u2019s neurochemical
actions, we do not fully know how neurochemicals change in real time
following ethanol\n        administration and drinking (acute and
chronic). Multidimensional measurement of neurochemical change (i.e.,
concentration, time, region) are needed to\n        reveal kinetics
underlying alcohol effects to guide future medication development and
promote mechanistic understanding of alcohol drinking.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        With this SBIR\/STTR grant solicitation, NIAAA seeks
development of biosensors enabling monitoring of regional neurochemical
changes in the brains of\n        rats and\/or mice in real time as they
 drink alcohol. Recent studies report the plausibility of using
microsensors coupled with wireless detection\n        methods to

 seeks development of microsensors with sufficient resolution to\n
  provide neuroanatomical regional specificity. In addition to brain
ethanol concentration, neurochemicals of interest include, but are not

Cancer Immunology and Hematology. The Cancer Immunology and Hematology
Branch (CIHB) supports a broad spectrum of basic research focused on
the\n        earliest stages of hematopoiesis and tracing the molecular
events that lead to the development of all the functional elements of
the immune system and,\n        when errors occur, to the development of
 leukemias and lymphomas. Most research of interest falls into three
major areas. The first is the immune\n        response to tumors to
include studies of all of the cells (T, B, NK, antigen-presenting, and
other myeloid cells) and secreted molecules (antibodies\n        and
cytokines) of the immune system that can recognize and affect tumor
growth. Emphasis is placed on the alteration in the mechanisms
responsible for\n        the failure of immune response to eradicate
most tumors under normal conditions, and the development of strategies
to circumvent these mechanisms. A\n        second major area of interest
 examines the biology of hematopoietic malignancies to describe the
molecular biology reasons underlying the cell's\n        failure to
respond to normal growth controls and to develop novel approaches to
prevention or therapy. The third distinct area supported is the basic\n
       biology of bone-marrow transplantation, including studies of host
 cell engraftment, graft-versus-host disease, and the basis of the\n

        enhancing the quality of cancer care through improvements in the
 prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. A driving force
fostering the\n        utilization of media technology to develop cancer
 communication products and their dissemination is NCI\u2019s Multimedia
 Technology and Health\n        Communication SBIR\/STTR Program. The
Program serves as an \u2018engine of innovation\u2019 translating cancer
 research into commercially viable products for\n        primary care
professionals, researchers, patients and their families, and the general
 public.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n               The objectives of this
program are to (1) fund science-based, theory-driven, user-centered
grants and contracts to translate cancer\n        research into
programs, interventions, systems, networks, or products needed by
professionals or the public to reduce cancer risk or improve the\n
  quality of life of cancer survivors; (2) promote the use of innovative
 media technology and\/or communication approaches in cancer
prevention\n        and control applications used in medical and
community settings; (3) improve communication behaviors of primary care
professions, patients,\n        and care-givers in cancer-related
matters; (4) promote organizational infrastructures changes that promote
 the use of products developed in\n        the program; (5) promote the
development of system models; and (6) expand the methods for evaluating
ehealth research and developed\n        products.\n    \n    \n    \n

The Radiation Research Program (RRP) supports basic, developmental and
applied research (including clinical) related to\n        cancer
treatment utilizing ionizing and non-ionizing radiations. Therapeutic
modalities include photon therapy, particle therapy, photodynamic
therapy\n        (PDT), hyperthermia, radioimmunotherapy (RIT), systemic
 targeted radionuclide therapy (STaRT), and boron neutron capture
therapy (BNCT). Radiation\n        research encompasses a range of
scientific disciplines including basic biology, chemistry, physics and
clinical radiation oncology. Topics of interest\n        include, but
are not limited to, the following areas:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  1.   Development of devices for planning, measuring, and delivering
radiation therapy or related therapies, including devices for patient
positioning\n        and quality assurance for the following: (a)
ionizing radiation, particularly 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy
(3DCRT) and intensity-modulated\n        radiotherapy (IMRT); (b) PDT;

that are based on a rationale for achieving a therapeutic gain (an
improved differential response between tumor and normal tissue) are\n
     of greatest interest. Enhancement of response must be achieved at
radiation doses and treatment schedules employed clinically.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        6.   Development of predictive assays and monitors
 of response to radiotherapy, PDT, hyperthermia, STaRT, or RIT. Tools

specific therapeutic approaches.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        G.
Biological Response Modifiers (BRM). Research on agents or approaches
that alter the relationship between tumor and host by modifying the
host's\n        biological response to tumor cells with resultant
therapeutic benefits. Both preclinical and clinical investigations are
conducted on the utility of a\n        wide variety of natural and
synthetic agents and on biological manipulations of immunological and
non-immunological host mediated, tumor-growth\n        controlling
mechanisms in cancer therapy.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

quality of life of cancer patients; research to investigate and enhance
clinical decision-making by both patients and\n        physicians; and
studies of the impact of individual preferences for health care outcomes
 and their impact on cancer prevention practices in persons\n
without cancer and on treatment decisions in patients with cancer.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        D.    Early Detection and Screening. New
diagnostic or screening methods for early detection of cancer,
especially for asymptomatic patients. Detection\n        methods can
include any cancer site, although there is more interest in the common
cancers, such as those of the lung and colon. Methods should be cost\n
      beneficial and applicable in a clinical setting.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        1.   Studies which identify and document new databases
relevant to early cancer detection and propose using new and
experimental analytical techniques.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.
  Analyses of long-term, follow-up data from completed studies for
potential new interpretations based on the passage of time.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        3.   Studies which propose to develop and evaluate

screening and detection methods when applied in defined or target
populations.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.   Currently, the most
commonly used method to detect prostatic cancer is the digital rectal
examination. Various devices and models would be\n        necessary for
the early detection of prostate cancers by physical examination. They
would include, but not limited to the following disease states: (1)\n
     absence of disease (normal model); (2) benign prostatic
hypertrophy; (3) prostatitis; (4) Stage B1 prostatic cancer (T2a); (5)
Stage B2 prostatic\n        cancer (T2b); and (6) Stage C prostatic
cancer (T3z, T3b, and T4).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        6.
Development of products that aid the systematic collection and transport
 of specimens used for the early detection of cancer, including
devices\n        for the collection and transport of urine, serum, fecal
 material, exfoliated cells, and other potential materials.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        7.   Develop computer utility programs that can
increase the clinical uses of existing programs commonly found in
medical offices creating age-sex\n        registries, predicting

systems, etc. Develop bioinformatics to study gene\n        profiling.\n
    \n    \n    \n    \n        8.   Develop personal computer programs
that can be used to determine population risks and the effect of

concept of Community Oriented Primary Care.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
     9.   Use of ultrasonography with color flow imaging for the early
detection of cancer. Research on the use of ultrasonography with color
flow imaging\n        (US-CFI) for the early detection of cancer of the
ovary, breast and\/or prostate. Emphasis should be given to the ability
of the US-CFI to differentiate\n        between malignant and benign
disease at these sites. Criteria for the discrimination of malignant
from benign disease would be developed as well as\n        performance
characteristics of this method, particularly for breast and prostate.
Studies on symptomatic populations should yield sensitivity,\n
specificity and positive predicative values when breast and prostate are

As more women seek mammographic breast screening, the importance of
efficient, high speed, \u201cintelligent\u201d mammographic systems
capable of acquiring\n        and storing large volumes of images and
enhancing image interpretation will become more important. Technological
 developments of interest are:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        a.
Develop digital mammographic systems for high volume applications with
electronic archiving and image analysis capabilities.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        b.   Develop artificial intelligence based interactive
image analysis software to enhance mammographic sensitivity and
specificity.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        E.    Cancer Biomarkers.
The Cancer Biomarkers Research Group (CBRG) promotes research on the
discovery, development, and validation of biomarkers for\n
pre-cancer and early cancer detection and relevant technologies so that
risk can be more accurately assessed and cancers can be detected at
early\n        stages of development. Early detection has the potential
to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality. In cancer research, biomarkers
 refer to substances\n        that are indicative of the presence of
cancer in the body. Biomarkers include genes, RNAs, proteins, and
metabolites. As the molecular changes that\n        occur during tumor
development can take place over a number of years, biomarkers can be
potentially used to detect cancers early. Topics of interest\n
include, but are not limited to, the following areas:\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        1.   Discovery, development and\/or validation of
biomarkers (genomic, epigenomic, proteomic and metabolomic) for
precancerous lesions, early cancer\n        detection, and
identification of risk.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.
Development of new biological, genetic, histochemical, immunologic, and
molecular assay or analyses applied to early cancer detection, risk\n
     assessment, or susceptibility.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.
  Development of new tools and technologies, including microfluidics and
 nanotechnologies, for analyzing biomarkers for early cancer detection
and\n        risk assessment.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        4.   In
silico data analysis for the discovery and identification of cancer
biomarkers.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.   Ancillary studies to
discover biomarkers from ongoing prevention and treatment trials and any
 large studies.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        6.   Development of
statistical and epidemiological approaches to biomarkers evaluation for
early cancer detection and risk.\n    \n    \n    \n\n",

neuroscience and behavioral research focuses on understanding the
mechanisms, characteristics, and processes of drug abuse both in adult\n
        and developing organisms. Basic behavioral, cognitive,
neurobiological, cellular, molecular, chemical, and genetics research
aims at characterizing and\n        understanding drug seeking,
compulsive behavior, and addictive processes. These research areas
necessarily include studies of normal processes. Using\n        both
animal and human studies, basic behavioral research focuses on
behavioral and cognitive processes that may or do lead to drug
initiation, and the\n        behavioral and cognitive consequences of
drug abuse. Neurobiology research focuses on the neural mechanisms and
substrates underlying behavioral and\n        cognitive processes and
vulnerability factors associated with drug abuse, addiction,
sensitization, tolerance, and relapse. DBNBR also supports basic\n
  chemistry and pharmacological studies focusing on structure\/activity

SBIR applications are solicited to discover new chemical compounds as
biological probes either by\n        synthesis or isolation from natural
 resources in studying the mechanisms of action of drugs of abuse. Such
substances could be new chemical compounds,\n        drug products, or

for Treatment of Pain.  Virtual Reality (VR) exposure can reduce
reported pain during wound care. Grant applications\n        are sought
to examine the utility of VR technologies in the treatment of various
types of pain. Development of treatments for both acute and chronic\n
     pain is sought. These treatments can be based in clinical settings
or the patients\u2019 homes. Phase I testing should establish the
feasibility of the use\n        of this technology in the particular
population to be tested. Phase I should also produce data that
demonstrates that this methodology is effective for\n        the
particular type of pain being treated. Phase II should involve
larger-scale testing (e.g., more subjects and treatment trials)
examining various\n        treatment parameters (e.g., timing of
treatment, types of VR environments). The focus of Phase II testing
should be the refinement of this treatment\n        for use in pain
patients.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        David Thomas, Ph.D.\n    \n

Reality for the Treatment of Drug Abuse.  Virtual Reality (VR) can be a
useful clinical tool. In this particular study, VR\n        exposure was
 used to allow patients to selectively not attend to an otherwise
painful procedure. Drug abuse, like pain, is a problem that is
strongly\n        impacted by stimuli in the abuser\u2019s environment
and psychological factors. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that VR may
be useful in allowing\n        individuals to ignore drugs cravings,
withdrawal symptoms or environmental cues that promote drug abuse. Grant
 applications are sought to examine the\n        utility of VR
technologies in the treatment of various types of drug abuse. These
treatments can be based in clinical settings or the patients' homes.\n
      These treatments can be developed to address drug withdrawal, drug
 craving or on-going drug related behaviors. The development of VR
technologies to\n        address abuse of all types of drugs (e.g.,
cocaine, marijuana, nicotine, alcohol, inhalants) is sought. Phase I
testing should establish the\n        feasibility of the use of this
technology for the particular drug problem addressed (e.g., cocaine
craving, opioid withdrawal) and should also produce\n        data that
demonstrates that this methodology is effective for the particular drug
problem. Phase II should involve larger-scale testing (e.g., more\n
   subjects and treatment trials) examining various treatment parameters
 (e.g., timing of treatment, types of VR environments). The focus of
Phase II\n        testing should be the refinement of this treatment for
 use in the treatment of drug abusers.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

\n        7.     Development of a Virtual Reality Environment for
Teaching about the Impact of Drug Abuse on the Brain.  Virtual reality
(VR) is\n        emerging as a technology with a multitude of uses
within the medical sciences. In terms of the science of drug abuse, it
is being developed as a\n        treatment tool. The current
solicitation seeks the development of a virtual reality environment that
 can be used in educational settings to teach about\n        how drugs
of abuse (both illicit and licit) affect the brain and behavior.\n    \n
    \n    \n    \n               The cost of portable hardware needed to
 present a VR environment is relatively inexpensive. If education
programs like the one sought in this\n        solicitation were
available, it is likely that VR would be used as a teaching tool in many
 settings, including classrooms and museums.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
             The particular program sought here is to present an
interactive three-dimensional virtual brain that shows normal brain
functions and, in\n        contrast, brain function after exposure to
drugs of abuse. This technology could illustrate the neurotoxic and
long-term effects of drug abuse on the\n        brain. This VR may
include other features that are not described above, provided that it
will be useful in educating individuals about the medical,\n
behavioral and social effects of drug abuse.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
             The phase I application should develop a beta version of
the program. Further, the phase I application should include a
preliminary\n        demonstration of \u201cusability,\u201d where it is
 shown that the types of people being educated with this program (e.g.
teachers) can effectively operate this\n        system without extensive
 training. Further, it should be demonstrated that the hardware is
easily worn by subjects, and that the subjects can rapidly\n
understand how to effectively interact in the VR environment.\n    \n

Therapies for Substance Abuse Treatment.  Nanoscience and
nanotechnology, by manipulating matter at the\n        atomic or
molecular levels, are emerging research areas that have the potential to
 fundamentally transform the study of biological systems and lead to\n
      the development of new methods for detection, prevention, and
treatment of substance abuse and related disease states. NIDA invites\n
       nanotechnology-based applications in the following areas:\n    \n
    \n    \n    \n        a.   Methods to enhance the efficacy of
FDA-approved compounds by reducing their size to the nanoscale range to
alter absorption, distribution,\n        metabolism, or excretion.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        b.   Development of new compounds, through
manipulation of matter at the atomic or molecular levels that could more
 readily pass the\n        blood-brain-barrier or cell membranes.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        c.   Development of nanoscale particles for
controlled targeted delivery of therapeutics, genes, or antibodies.\n
 \n    \n    \n    \n        d.   Methods to enhance existing imaging
technologies using magnetic properties at the nanoscale.\n    \n    \n
  \n    \n        e.   Application of nanostructures (e.g. noble metal
nanoparticles, quantum dots, and nanolithographic structures that show
promise for diagnostic\n        development) for identification and
analysis of genes, proteins, and other biological molecules implicated
in the actions of drugs of abuse.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  Applications are invited from any of the above areas. Phase I should
demonstrate convincingly the viability of the proposed innovation,
whereas\n        Phase II should carry out the development,
characterization, testing, and screening of the innovation.\n    \n

Genomics Resources and Strategies.  In the post-genomic era, an
explosion of gene discovery studies utilizing strategies\n        such
as genome-wide association scans, microarrays, and proteomics have
identified a host of genes\/gene variants associated with susceptibility
 to, or\n        protection from, diseases of addiction. A critical next
 step is to validate these candidate genes\/variants to determine which
ones play an authentic\n        functional role in mediating addiction.
Functional validation could occur at many different phenotypic levels
ranging from the molecular to the\n        behavioral. Studies could
investigate a few high priority genes\/variants or could test several
hundred genes\/variants rapidly. The development of\n        resources
and strategies that would facilitate functional validation of
genes\/gene variants include (but are not limited to) the following
areas:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        a.   Gene\/variant effects on
subcellular localization, stability, or function of mRNAs\/proteins
relevant to drug addiction.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        b.   The
development of imaging and other strategies to identify gene\/variant
effects on neuronal or brain functions relevant to addiction.\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n        c.   Strategies to identify gene\/variant effects
 on behavior, such as response to addictive stimuli, stress, or changes
in social situations.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        d.   RNA
interference-mediated depletion of candidate genes in cells or whole
organisms to look for phenotypic alterations such as changes in
synapse,\n        dendritic spine, or cell morphology, gene expression,
or behavioral responses to drugs of abuse.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
    e.   Strategies exploiting the growing collection of genetic mutants
 in candidate genes (particularly utilizing model organisms such as
mouse,\n        zebrafish, Drosophila, C. elegans or yeast) to
functionally validate genes\/variants.\n    \n    \n    \n    \nf.

     Development of new imaging techniques, reagents and related
hardware and software for dynamic investigations of the effects of drugs
 of abuse on\n        cellular activities and communications. For
example, these techniques might include, but are not limited to,
development and utilization of reagents\n        for magnetic resonance

Research Branch (PRB). The Prevention Research Branch (PRB) supports a
program of research in drug abuse and drug related HIV\n
prevention to (1) examine the efficacy and effectiveness of new and
innovative theory-based prevention approaches for drug abuse,
drug-related HIV\/AIDS\n        and other associated health risks, (2)
determine the cognitive, social, emotional, biological and behavioral
processes that account for effectiveness\n        of approaches, (3)
clarify factors related to the effective and efficient provision of
prevention services, and (4) develop and test methodologies\n
appropriate for studying these complex aspects of prevention science.\n
   \n    \n    \n    \n               Prevention Research.  Rigorous
scientific prevention research is encouraged to study novel approaches
to substance abuse prevention for\n        use at multiple levels of the
 social environment including: the family, schools, peer groups,
community and faith-based organizations, the workplace,\n        health
care systems, etc. The purpose of this research is to determine the
efficacy and effectiveness of novel program materials, training
strategies,\n        and technologies developed to prevent the onset and
 progression of drug abuse and drug-related HIV\/AIDS infection.
Materials and technologies may\n        target a single risk-level or
may take a comprehensive approach encompassing audiences at the
universal, selective, and\/or indicated levels. Universal\n
interventions target the general population; selective target subgroups
of the population with defined risk factors for substance abuse;
indicated\n        interventions target individuals who have detectable
signs or symptoms foreshadowing drug abuse and addiction, but who have
not met diagnostic\n        criteria. NIDA encourages the development
and testing of innovative prevention intervention technologies that are
sensitive and relevant to cultural\n        and gender differences.\n
 \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Laboratory studies of the underlying
mechanisms and effects of various prevention approaches such as
persuasive communication (e.g., mass media\n        and print media) as
they are affected by and effect drug related cognition, emotion,
motivation and behaviors.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.
Decomposition of prevention programs, practices and strategies to
understand components that account for program effectiveness.\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n        3.   Research on features of prevention
curricula, materials, implementation, approaches, training, technical
assistance, and systems integration that\n        contribute to positive
 outcomes.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        4.   Training modules and
ongoing technical assistance for program implementers of research based
substance abuse prevention programming strategies.\n    \n    \n    \n
  \n        5.   Prevention intervention dissemination technologies and
mechanisms that integrate research with practice; specifically the
transfer of drug abuse\n        prevention information to
decision-makers, funders, and practitioners.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

change strategies for schools, neighborhoods, communities, etc. to use
in reducing substance use\n        initiation and\/or progression.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        10. Development of practical and affordable
community tools for: needs and resource assessment, selection of
appropriate evidence-based programs and\n        strategies,
high-quality implementation of identified programs and strategies,
evaluation at community, organization and individual levels, and\n
  sustainability.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        11. Drug abuse
prevention methodological research on promising data collection, data
storage, data dissemination, and reporting techniques.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        12. Promoting wider and more effective (e.g. with
enhanced fidelity) use of evidence-based prevention interventions for
substance abuse and related HIV\n        prevention, including
interventions made available thru CDC and other federal agencies.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        13. Studies applying technologies and
strategies that have been developed for use in other disciplines in
order to examine the utility of their\n        application for drug
abuse prevention, such as virtual reality technologies being used for
some clinical conditions (e.g. phobias, eating disorders),\n        and
serious video games are being used for some clinical conditions (e.g.,
cancer patients), but not for drug abuse prevention.\n    \n    \n    \n
    \n        14. Development and testing of innovative drug abuse
prevention intervention products, using discoveries from the basic
biological (e.g.\n        neurobiological), psychological (e.g.
emotional, behavioral, cognitive, and developmental) and social (e.g.
social learning, peer network, and\n        communications) sciences.\n
   \n    \n    \n    \n        15. Development and testing of
adaptations for efficacious prevention research approaches to make these
 more appropriate for special populations\n        including racial and
ethnic minorities, non-English speaking populations, immigrant
populations, rural and migrant populations, low literacy\n
populations, or persons with disabilities.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
    16. Development of methods, state-of-the-art tools and systems for
community coalition-building.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        17.
Development and testing of tools to measure intervention costs, cost
effectiveness, and net economic benefits.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
   18. Development and testing of rapid assessment tools of sexual and
drug use risk behaviors for use in health care and public health
environments,\n        including STI clinics and AIDS research
centers.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        19. Development and testing of
 tools to promote security and appropriate prescribing of scheduled
prescription drugs. Technologies can be developed to\n        assist
medical professionals, schools, service providers and others in making
prescribing decisions, educating patients and their caretakers, or\n
    dispensing and monitoring of medications.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
       20. Development of new technologies to support drug abuse
prevention interventions with military personnel, veterans and their
families. Tools can\n        include adaptations of efficacious and
effective drug abuse prevention interventions to maximize health care
efficiencies and to address negative life\n        stress resulting from
 sustained combat operations, a major contributor to both the onset and
exacerbation of substance abuse and mental health\n        problems.\n
  \n    \n    \n    \n        21. Development of new technologies for

dianaa@nida.nih.gov\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        B.    Epidemiology
Research Branch (ERB).  The ERB supports a research program on drug
abuse epidemiology that includes (1) studies of trends and\n
patterns of drug abuse and related conditions such as HIV\/AIDS in the
general population and among subpopulations, (2) studies of causal
mechanisms\n        leading to onset, escalation, maintenance, and
cessation of drug abuse across stages of human development, (3) studies
of person\u2013environment\n        interactions, (4) studies of
behavioral and social consequences of drug abuse, (5) bio-epidemiologic
studies including genetic epidemiology studies,\n        (6)
methodological studies to improve the design of epidemiologic studies
and to develop innovative statistical approaches, including modeling\n
      techniques.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Improvement of
Reliability and Validity of Reporting of Sensitive Data.  The
reliability and validity of self-report of drug use\n        and related
 behaviors (e.g., HIV risk behavior) is a matter of great concern. Use
of new technologies for real time data collection in ecological\n
 settings is of great interest because these technologies enable
collection of drug consumption data in context. Studies to improve
methodologies based\n        on variations of standard survey protocols
or computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) and personal interview (CAPI)
 are also encouraged.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Instrument
Development.  Easy-to-use assessment instruments are needed to enhance
epidemiology research. Areas of interest include but\n        are not
limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        a.   Community Assessment.
The development of community diagnostic instruments for psychometrically
 sound assessment of community\n        characteristics is essential to
improve our understanding of how community factors affect drug abuse and
 ensuing behavioral and social consequences.\n        Standardized
assessments of community characteristics are needed to better understand
 the full impact of drug use and to develop targeted interventions\n
    to specific community needs.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        b.
Assessment of Psychiatric Comorbidity in Community Settings. Easy to
use, reliable, and valid instruments are needed to assess\n
psychiatric comorbidity in different populations of drug abusers,
including adolescents and those in community drug abuse treatment
settings.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        c.   Assessment Instruments
to Measure CNS Function Related to Drug Abuse. The development of
age-appropriate assessment instruments to\n        measure behavioral
and cognitive function over the course of development will contribute to
 our understanding of vulnerability to drug abuse and\n
functional impairment due to drug use.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
3.   Development of State-of-the-Art Mechanisms for Epidemiological
Research.  The development of state-of-the-art mechanisms to
facilitate\n        the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in
 community epidemiology studies (for example Community Epidemiology Work
 Groups) and other drug\n        abuse research is if great interest.
There is a need for enhanced software and hardware for GIS interfaces,
database management, visualization, and\n        innovative spatial
analysis capabilities. The role of GIS in public health management and
practice continues to evolve. Application of this technology\n        is
 an important step towards better understanding drug abuse issues and
their inherent complexities. The ability to evaluate geospatial
information\n        provides a unique perspective of public health
issues such as emerging and shifting epidemics, the utilization of
treatment services, and rapid\n        assessment of the impact of
incidents ranging from natural disasters to bioterrorism. When used
alongside more traditional epidemiological techniques,\n        GIS
provides epidemiologists the ability to address new questions, refine,
or enhance existing analyses.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Bethany

        4.   Improving Measures of Addiction Risk.  Individual
differences in risk for drug addiction are often expressed in degree
rather than kind,\n        that is, as gradations along an underlying
continuum that stretches from unobservable variations in risk for
addiction to extreme and fully\n        debilitating addiction severity.
 Assessment instruments in use today for measuring drug addiction (i.e.,
 compulsivity in seeking and using drugs\n        despite harmful
consequences) have proven reliability and validity, but are of limited
use for evaluating individual differences in risk for drug\n
addiction. Advances in computerized adaptive testing methods,
computer-assisted technologies, and psychometrics, including item
response theory,\n        suggest that the capabilities now exist for
the development of the next generation in addiction assessment. New
assessment instruments are needed to\n        detect meaningful
variation between, within, and across individuals over time that is
scalable along the dimension of risk for addiction; these\n
instruments should allow for efficient assessment of the risk construct
with minimal burden for administration, training, and cost to the
researcher,\n        clinician, research participant, or patient; and
they should ultimately provide valid and reliable scores corresponding
to established diagnostic\n        criteria for substance use
disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Elizabeth Lambert, M.Sc.\n

Developing, Validating, Refining Tools for Ecologic Momentary
Assessment.  Ecologic Momentary Assessment (EMA) includes the
measurement\n        of exposures and events in real time as they occur,
 and in the natural environment where they occur, such as the home,
neighborhood, or workplace. EMA\n        tools include portable
technologies for longitudinal data collection in the field, such as
mobile phone electronic diaries and PDAs, geopositioning\n
devices, motion sensors, biosensors, environmental sensors, and
audiovisual devices. In addiction and behavioral research, new EMA tools
 may enhance\n        the contextual and temporal resolution of
exposures, and the biological or behavioral processes presumed to occur
in response. Specific challenges to\n        address in the
implementation of EMA include optimizing the timing of measurement and
data quality, establishing sensor validity and reliability in\n
different populations, reducing intensely longitudinal data for
statistical analysis, achieving user acceptability, and safeguarding
user privacy.\n        Studies are encouraged that address these and
other challenges to improve the validity and acceptability of EMA
tools.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Louise Eideroff, Ph.D.\n    \n

Services Research Branch (SRB).  The SRB supports a program of research
on the effectiveness of drug abuse treatment with a focus on the
quality,\n        cost, access to, and cost-effectiveness of care for
drug abuse dependence disorders. Primary research foci include: (a) the
effectiveness and\n        cost-benefits and cost-effectiveness of drug
abuse treatment, (b) factors affecting treatment access, utilization,
and health and behavioral outcomes\n        for defined populations, (c)
 the effects of organization, financing, and management of services on
treatment outcomes, (d) drug abuse service delivery\n        systems and
 models, such as continuity of care, stages of change, or service
linkage and integration models, and (e) drug abuse treatment services
for\n        HIV seropositive patients and for those at risk of
infection.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Drug Abuse Treatment
Economic Research.  This initiative will support research to design and
develop data systems for financial\n        management and economic
analysis of treatment programs and larger systems in new healthcare
settings and managed care networks. Managerial\n        decision-making
requires the implementation of sophisticated data systems to facilitate
routine budgeting processes, allocation of resources,\n
performance measurement, and pricing decisions. The focus is on the
needs of managers within the organization and managers outside of the
organization.\n        Data system development must be based on standard
 cost behavior and profit analysis. Data systems must be designed with
correct cost concepts\n        (accounting and economic) in order to
permit cost and pricing decisions to be developed for new treatment
technologies and management of ongoing\n        systems. In research
settings, such an initiative is vital for the assessment of new
technologies developed for transfer to practice.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        2.   Determining the Costs of Implementing Evidence-Based
Practices (EBPs) and Other Technologies in Drug Abuse Treatment.
Research shows\n        that new technologies or evidence-based
practices (EBPs) can improve drug treatment outcomes, and it has been
asserted that large-scale drug abuse\n        treatment improvement
requires systematic implementation of proven practices, processes, and
technologies. Often, however, new drug treatment\n        approaches are
 not adopted or sustained in usual practice, even in programs that
served as settings for research showing their effectiveness. This may\n
       be due in part to a poor understanding of the initial or ongoing
costs entailed by new practices, processes, or technologies (hereafter
referred to as\n        technologies). Methods and tools need to be
developed and tested to help drug abuse treatment service providers and
payers arrive at realistic\n        estimates of the costs of
implementing and sustaining new technologies in usual practice settings.
 With regard to new technologies, implementing is\n        defined as an
 ongoing process of selecting, adopting, and adapting these new
technologies into ongoing treatment, particularly with consideration
for\n        the local setting, population and available resources.
Sustaining is defined as an ongoing process of providing needed
resources (such as staffing,\n        training, and equipment),
maintaining the quality of the new technology through evaluation,
monitoring, and improvement, and determining its ongoing\n
utility compared to alternatives. The tools and methodologies should be
able to identify and estimate costs separately for implementing and
for\n        sustaining new technologies, and should consider both
clinical and administrative technology. At a minimum, domains in which
costs should be estimated\n        include assessment of programmatic
need, appropriateness, and value; staffing qualifications (salary and
competencies); training, support, equipment,\n        and other
infrastructure requirements; information \/ data requirements; quality
monitoring and improvement; and evaluation of outcomes.\n    \n    \n

Selection Technology Research for Drug Abuse Treatment Clinics. Research
 is showing that employee turnover is a substantial\n        problem
among substance abuse treatment services providers. Applications
supporting innovative research that develops and validates generic
staff\n        selection systems which could be adopted and tailored for
 use by drug abuse treatment clinics are welcome. Like many small
businesses, drug abuse\n        treatment clinics have problems
attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Also like many small
businesses, treatment clinics have limited resources\n        to apply
to the recruiting, screening, and hiring of new and replacement
personnel. Research has shown that the application of standardized
screening\n        and selection methods designed to maximize person-job
 fit can cost-effectively reduce staff turnover. Systematic methods such
 as background\n        inventories, protocol-driven interviews,
aptitude tests, and credit checks have demonstrated validity for
improving person-job fit. Examples of\n        possible projects might
include development of easy-to-understand guidance about legal
considerations in hiring practices, software that transform job\n
 task analysis into selection criteria, interview protocols to
standardize applicant screening, tolls to help improve recruitment,
and\/or self-paced\n        training for hiring officials or interview
panels to improve screening reliability.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  4.   Customer Retention Technology.  Premature disengagement from drug
 abuse treatment participation is a common problem and ranges from\n
    approximately 30 to 60% based upon the clinic and modality studied.
Past research has very frequently attributed dropping out of treatment
to\n        participant characteristics (e.g., motivation, addiction
severity, comorbidity) and\/or environmental factors (e.g., social
pressures, unemployment,\n        homelessness). Seldom has the dropout
problem been studied in the context of customer satisfaction. That is,
there is little research looking at the\n        causes of dropping out
of treatment attributable to organizational factors (e.g., policies,
practices, context) that influence participant withdrawal\n
decisions. Needed are tools and systems for assessing and surveying drug
 abuse treatment program participant perceptions and satisfaction
levels,\n        summarizing and report participant assessments,
interpreting results, and adjusting policies and practices to improve
satisfaction and participant\n        retention in treatment.\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n        5.   Effective Management and Operation of Drug
Abuse Treatment Services Delivery.  The bulk of drug abuse treatment is
conducted in small\n        clinical settings with therapeutic staffs of
 less than a dozen people. Small clinics lack resources to help improve
efficiency and effectiveness in\n        both business and therapeutic
practices. Areas that may be of interest to small businesses include,
but are not limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        a.
Computer-based leader\/manager self assessment tools: On-line and other
types of tools to help those supervising the delivery of drug abuse\n
     treatment services to gain insights about personal strengths and
weaknesses, and to help guide them to improved leadership and management
 practices.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        b.   Organizational change
tools: Handbooks describing step-by-step way to introduce more efficient
 business practices such as quality\n        management\/monitoring,
creating empowered work teams, formalized goal setting, improved
customer relations, forming organization linkages, and adopting\n
 new fiscal and resource management techniques.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        c.   Organizational change tools: Handbooks describing
step-by-step ways to introduce more efficient or effective therapeutic
practices such as, adding\n        pharmacotherapy in a previously
drug-free clinic, adopting new medical\/pharmacotherapy or behavioral
interventions, and adopting new approaches to\n        clinical
collaboration and\/or case management.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
6.   Assessment Tools for Quantifying and Organizational Culture that
Promotes and Sustains a Drug-Free Workforce.  Though drug-free
workplace\n        programs are ubiquitous in large businesses, small
businesses often lack the staff and resources to create effective
drug-free programs because they\n        may involve in-house or
contract experts to educate, train, monitor, and enforce policies and
practices that will sustain a healthy workforce and a\n        safe and
healthy workplace. Though there are numerous model drug-free workplace
policies and programs provided free by federal, state, and local\n
  governments as well as nongovernmental organizations, many fail to
provide management with affordable or free, easy-to-use tools to assess
the baseline\n        of their organizations\u2019 culture for drug
abuse intolerance, and to monitor progress in building a drug-free
organizational culture. Research shows that\n        individual
employees and organizations vary in their support for a drug-free
workplace. Surveys indicate that coworker tolerance for illicit drug
use\n        varies by the type of drug, the type of industry, and the
work role of the respondents. A drug-free culture creates commonly-held
attitudes, beliefs\n        and practices among employees that are
socially reinforced. Once established, the need for costly external
incentives and other measures abates as\n        coworkers socialize new
 incumbents and enforce behavior promoting abstinence. Tools and
methodologies need to be developed to a) assess an\n
organization\u2019s baseline culture for drug abuse intolerance both on
and off the job, b) identify policies and practices that undermine a
drug-free\n        culture, c) enable the identification of programs,
policies, and practices capable of helping the workforce
develop\/strengthen an organizational\n        culture of intolerance
for drug use, and d) estimate the impact on the organization\u2019s
quality of work-life, job safety, individual and group\n
performance and productivity, and the profitability of the organization
itself. Included would be inexpensive and easy to use tools for
monitoring\n        workforce behavior change, and changes in the impact
 on the organization (as outlined in \u201cd\u201d).\n    \n    \n    \n

Technologies: Transporting Services Research to Practice.  This
initiative will support the development and testing of the\n
effectiveness of web-based technologies that facilitate the translation
of drug abuse prevention and treatment services research into practice.
The\n        ultimate goal is the delivery of efficacious, low-cost
interventions to the greatest number of individuals in community
settings. Delivery of\n        evidence-based services in community
settings often is hampered by lack of state-of-the-art information about
 the contents of efficacious\n        interventions, the organizational
structures and processes that make effective implementation possible,
and available training and technical\n        assistance. Applications
may include, but are not limited to, the development and testing of new
and innovative Internet-based systems that provide\n
practitioners with (a) current information on evidence-based treatments
with the greatest promise for defined populations of drug abusers; (b)\n
        assistance in translating clinical trials data into clinically
useful information; (c) information and training on how to effectively
organize, manage,\n        and deliver evidence-based prevention and
treatment services; (d) strategies for organizational change and
capacity building; and (e) access to\n        training and technical
assistance on the adoption of new prevention and treatment
interventions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n8.          New Technologies for
 Screening, Assessing, and Preventing Problem Drug Use and HIV, Matching
 Patients with Appropriate Treatment Services. \n        Increased
understanding of the complexities of problem drug use and HIV risk
behaviors has sparked growing interest in and increased need for new\n
      user-friendly technologies to assist in the screening, assessment,
 and prevention of drug abuse and HIV, and in the matching of patients
with\n        appropriate treatment services. New technologies,
including CD-ROM, hand-held, Internet, videotape, videodisc, and other
electronic means have great\n        potential for helping treatment
providers in specialty and non-specialty care settings including primary
 care contexts to (a) screen for problem drug\n        use and
associated health problems and risk behaviors, including HIV, (b) assess
 the nature and degree of drug use and HIV risk behaviors, (c) embed\n
      items for screening or assessing problem drug use within existing
clinical tools, (d) deliver appropriate prevention interventions, and
(e) identify\n        appropriate types and levels of treatment services
 for patients based on their individual treatment needs. These new
technologies potentially can\n        provide a more cost effective way
of identifying problem drug use, HIV risk behaviors and infection, and
associated health problems in a variety of\n        health care
settings, speeding the assessment and treatment process, and improving
treatment placement decisions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Dionne

        9.   Reintegration of Criminal Offenders into the Community.
Many offenders enter the criminal justice system with drug abuse
problems and\n        related health issues. In addition to addressing
these health care issues within the prison walls, treatment programs are
 increasingly called upon to\n        help offenders successfully
reintegrate into the community following incarceration. This often means
 helping offenders to manage their recovery through\n        monitoring,
 linkage with continuing care services, development of social support
networks, and education of friends and family members about the nature\n
        of drug abuse and the challenges facing the offender upon
release from prison. It is estimated that over the next several years,
more than 600,000\n        criminal justice offenders, many of whom have
 drug abuse problems, per year will be released to return to their
communities. New technologies are\n        needed to help treatment
providers in the criminal justice system and in the community coordinate
 efforts to effectively (a) monitor offenders\u2019\n        recovery
once they have been released into the community, (b) prevent relapse,
(c) identify relapse early and efficiently re-engage released
offenders\n        in appropriate treatment, (d) link released offenders
 with continuing care services in the community, (e) develop social
support networks for recently\n        released offenders in recovery,
and (e) educate offenders\u2019 family members so that they can more
effectively support offenders in recovery once they\n        have been
released from prison.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Dionne Jones,

 10. Technologies to Support Quality Improvement in Addiction Treatment
Systems.  New technologies to support quality improvement in\n
community-based, addiction treatment provider systems are needed.
Quality improvement methods, although well established in business and
healthcare\n        management, are underutilized in addiction
treatment. Addiction treatment systems have limited resources for
initiating, developing, implementing, and\n        sustaining quality
improvement practices. Most community-based provider systems have
limited capacity to capture and integrate information about (a)\n
 the nature and extent of community needs and resources; (b)
organizational and management processes to facilitate adoption,
adaptation, implementation,\n        and sustained use of science-based
innovations; (c) implementation costs for new service innovations; (d)
client satisfaction; and (e) quality of care.\n        Centralized,
automated and cost-efficient technological tools for these purposes
could help provider systems improve the quality and efficiency of\n
   their treatment services, meet accreditation requirements, and reduce
 operating costs.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Bennett Fletcher,

   11. Electronic Drug Abuse Treatment Referral Systems for Physicians.
 Research shows that primary care physicians often do not screen for
drug\n        abuse disorders. While this may be related to stigma
attached to illicit drug use or to a lack of adequate health insurance,
it may also be due to the\n        lack of an adequate referral system
that primary care physicians can use for the patients they identify as
having a potential drug problem. The lack of\n        a referral system
places a greater burden on the physician to secure treatment resources
for the patient, and also places the physician at greater risk\n
if no appropriate treatment can be found. A practical and usable
electronic drug abuse treatment referral system needs to be developed
and tested for\n        use by physicians in primary care settings,
including doctor\u2019s offices. To be effective and useful, the system
needs to be targeted at local needs, for\n        example by taking into
 account local private insurance coverage and the types of insurance
accepted by local treatment providers. It should also\n        include
an actively-maintained database of local providers, with information on
insurance carrier, geographic \u201ccatchment\u201d area of treatment
providers,\n        types of substance disorders treated, types of
co-occurring disorders (mental disorders, etc.) treated, gender, age,
other pertinent treatment factors\n        needed by primary care
physicians to make appropriate referrals. The system should be designed
to be reliable and efficient, allowing for appointment\n
scheduling or other needed arrangements to ensure a successful referral.
 Feasibility and cost-efficiency should be carefully considered.\n    \n

the Clinical Trials Network (CTN) is to improve the quality of drug
abuse treatment throughout the country using science as the vehicle.\n
      The CTN provides an enterprise in which the National Institute on

providers\n        cooperatively develop, validate, refine, and deliver
new treatment options to patients in community-level clinical practice.
This unique partnership\n        between community treatment providers
and academic research leaders aims to achieve the following
objectives:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \u00b7        Conducting
studies of behavioral, pharmacological, and integrated behavioral and
pharmacological treatment interventions of therapeutic effect\n
in rigorous, multi-site clinical trials to determine effectiveness
across a broad range of community-based treatment settings and
diversified patient\n        populations; and\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
       \u00b7        Ensuring the transfer of research results to
physicians, clinicians, providers, and patients.\n    \n    \n    \n

scudderq@nida.nih.gov\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Specific projects
 could include:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.     Development of
Combination Medication for Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose in the
 Presence of Benzodiazepines.  Suspected opioid\n
overdose\u2014coma, apnea and pin point pupil\u2014is treated by the
administration of naloxone, which, while effective, is short-lived.
Patients often leave the\n        Emergency Room, return immediately to
opioid use, and suffer dire consequences as a result. There is
sufficient preclinical and clinical evidence that\n        buprenorphine
 may be a more effective medication for treatment of opioid overdose in
such patients. However, the clinical development of this treatment\n
    strategy has been hampered by concerns that many opioid abusers also
 abuse benzodiazepine, and in such patients the administration of
buprenorphine may\n        be hazardous. Fumazinil, a specific
benzodiazepine antagonist used to treat benzodiazepine overdose, can be
co-administered with buprenorphine and may\n        protect such
patients from the ill effects of buprenorphine in cases of overdose
involving both opioids and benzodiazepine. The goal is to develop and\n
       test the buprenorphine-fumazinil combination medication
formulation for the treatment of opioid overdose with suspected
concurrent benzodiazepine\n        abuse.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
   2.     Screening and Development of Partial Agonists at the Human CB1
 Receptor for Treatment of Marijuana Dependence or Withdrawal.  NIDA\n
      seeks applications to screen and\/or develop CB1-receptor partial
agonists for application in the pharmacotherapeutic treatment of
marijuana dependence\n        or withdrawal. The potential benefits of
CB1-receptor partial agonists in the treatment of dependence may
parallel those of safe and effective nicotine\n        or opiate
partial-agonist replacement therapies, where buprenorphine and
varenicline have demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing abstinence
from\n        opioid use and cigarette smoking, respectively. As implied
 by the designations of partial-agonist replacement or substitution
therapy, a\n        partial-agonist medication has core biological
effects similar to those of the abused drug. Importantly however, there
is a ceiling-effect dose with\n        the administration of partial
agonists not present with full agonists such that at high doses, partial
 agonists are less likely to precipitate adverse\n        behavioral or
biological events and to have abuse liability compared to full agonists.
 The phase I project should identify compounds that bind to human\n
   CB1-receptors as partial agonists and, in the phase II, the grantee
should develop and evaluate selected partial agonists.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        3.     Improved Device to Capture and Measure Drug Use
in Oral Fluid.  Oral fluid (OF) testing is a promising method to monitor
 for drugs of\n        abuse. The main advantages of OF is the
simplicity and noninvasiveness of sample collection. Aside of
patient\u2019s\/ study participant\u2019s comfort and\n
preference compared to urine drug screen, the oral fluid sample
collection can be easily observed, obviating the need for special
restroom facilities\n        and same-sex collectors and making
adulteration of the specimen more difficult. Furthermore, infection risk
 is lower than for drawing blood. For\n        clinical toxicology
applications, including use in clinical trials, drug treatment programs,
 physician office and emergency room testing, onsite OF\n        testing
 would offer rapid availability of results for diagnostic or research
purposes. At this point, however, Substance Abuse and Mental Health\n
     Services Administration approval of OF testing has been delayed
because of questions about drug device performance, disposition of drugs
 in OF, and\n        need for improvement of assays. The greatest
current limitation for OF testing is the small number of controlled drug
 administration studies available\n        to inform interpretation of
OF tests. (Bosker, Huestis, 2009) Applications should address current
limitations and present methods to remove obstacles\n        for wider
usage of OF testing in clinical practice and research.\n    \n    \n

Testing for Drugs of Abuse. Clinical Chemistry.2009; 55:11 1910-1931\n
  \n    \n    \n    \n        4.     Improved Technology of Testing
Devices to Remotely Capture and Measure Drug Use in Biological
Specimens.  There is an ongoing need for\n        more accurate,
practical and convenient point-of-collection testing devices for
monitoring drugs of abuse. Current devices that test for illicit drugs\n
        in urine, oral fluid (saliva), sweat and hair have strengths and
 limitations. The goal of this solicitation is to develop new
technologies\/devices that\n        will increase strengths (e.g.
accuracy, practicality, and convenience) and decrease limitations (e.g.
minimum frequency, contamination, and\n        adulteration) of testing
methodologies. New technology might permit testing from remote locations
 (e.g. patient\u2019s or subject\u2019s home) while ensuring\n
real time data collection and transfer into medical records\/study
databases. Risk of adulteration should be minimized to a level
comparable with tests\n        provided in drug treatment centers or
study sites. The phase I application should explore all tests currently
available, especially new technologies\n        allowing for remote
collection of the data. In phase II, the grantee should develop and test
 a prototype.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.          New
Technologies: Integrating Data from Prescription Monitoring Program(s)
to Current Clinical Practice.  In some states the\n        prescription
monitoring program collects prescription data for controlled substances
into a central database that can then be used by a limited number\n
   of authorized users to assist in deterring the illegitimate use of
prescription drugs. Prescribers and dispensers in some states may query
the database\n        to assist in determining treatment history and to
rule out the possibility that a patient is "doctor shopping" or
"scamming" to obtain controlled\n        substances. Limited
time\/resources of busy medical offices are a barrier to obtaining and
utilizing this information to improve quality of treatment\n        for
each individual patient. This initiative will support development and
testing of the effectiveness of new technologies that facilitate
utilization\n        of data collected by Prescription Monitoring
Program(s) in clinical practice. Applications may include, but are not
limited to, the development and\n        testing of new and innovative
Internet-based systems that provide a) practitioners with current
information of their patients\u2019 treatment\/medication\n
compliance; and b) transfers data automatically to patients chart, etc.
The goal is to minimize barriers faced by clinical staff to obtain,
record and\n        utilize the data while maintaining strict security
requirements (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability). These
 new technologies should\n        provide a more cost effective way of
identifying treatment non-compliance and help adjust a treatment plan
according to the needs of individual\n        patients as well as
decrease potential diversion of controlled substances. The phase I
application will explore and describe current Prescription\n
Monitoring Programs and new technologies allowing development and
testing of the application in phase II.\n    \n    \n    \n\n",

   1.   Synthesis (either using traditional or combinatorial techniques)
 or discovery (natural products) of new chemical compounds that would
have\n        potential as treatment agents for the medical management
of stimulant (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine, or nicotine) addiction.
Consideration should be\n        given to the design of partial agonists
 or pure antagonists that diminish the reinforcing effects of
stimulants, as well as full agonists that could\n        function to
normalize physiological activity following discontinuation of stimulant
use. The CPB supports research in the design (including molecular\n
   modeling and structure-activity relationship studies) and synthesis
of novel compounds, formulation development, bioanalytical methods
development, and\n        pharmacokinetics\/ pharmacodynamics aimed at
the discovery and development of new medications for treating drug
addiction. Areas that may be of interest\n        to small businesses
include, but are not limited to research related to the design and
development of new compounds and improved drug products (drug\n
delivery) for the treatment of drug addiction.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
        2.   Compounds of interest include those that are designed to
affect dopaminergic (i.e., D1 agonists, D3 agonists and D3 antagonists)
activity, CRF\n        antagonists, compounds affecting glutamate
activity, GABAergic activity, small molecule neuropeptide antagonists
and compounds acting through other\n        mechanisms for which
justification has been supplied.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.

Discovery and Toxicology Branch (MDTB).  The MDTB supports research on
the development of preclinical behavioral models (e.g., of\n
craving, drug-seeking behavior, dependence, or relapse), biochemical
assays, gene expressional assays and electrophysiological methods to
identify and\n        characterize new medications to treat substance
abuse, as well as pharmacological screening of novel compounds to
identify potential drug abuse\n        medications. The Branch also
supports research on toxicity studies of potential medications for the
treatment of substance abuse, and interactions of\n        potential
treatment medications with abused substances. Areas that may be of
interest to small businesses include, but are not limited to
development\n        of new methods for discovery of medications useful
in treating drug addiction. Of special interest would be the development
 of new animal models of\n        addiction, incorporating established
drug self-administration techniques that show increased relevance to the
 clinical setting. Development of relevant\n        biochemical or
electrophysiological screening methods is also encouraged.\n    \n    \n

(MRGB).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Develop Novel Treatments
for SRDs.  The MRGB seeks to support the development of novel
pharmacotherapeutic- and immunological treatments\n        for persons
with substance-related disorders (SRDs). The Branch also supports
projects aimed at incorporating technological advances that could be
used\n        to more effectively treat SRDs.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
             This solicitation aims to support small business
development of compounds that have completed (or are nearing completion
of) successful\n        preclinical evaluation. Treatments should aim to
 help subjects reduce drug use, become drug free, prolong
abstinence\/reduce craving, or facilitate\n        survival from drug
overdose.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n              Therapies that small
businesses might consider evaluating include, but are not limited to:\n
   \n    \n    \n    \n        \u00b7        A novel (e.g., new chemical
 entity, novel drug formulation) that could be used to treat SRDs\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        \u00b7        A marketed compound (e.g.,
SSRIs, anti-epileptic drugs) that could be used to treat SRDs\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n        \u00b7        Vaccines for substances of abuse
(e.g., cocaine, nicotine)\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \u00b7
 Monoclonal antibodies for substances of abuse (e.g., methamphetamine,
PCP)\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \u00b7        Naturally-occurring
compounds (e.g., dietary supplements) that could be used to treat SRDs\n
    \n    \n    \n    \n        \u00b7        Or, a rationalized
poly-therapeutic combination of pharmacotherapies designed to more
comprehensively treat SRDs\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
Treatments that concurrently help alleviate associated psychiatric
co-morbidities (e.g., depression, schizophrenia, PTSD, anxiety, etc.)
and\/or\n        are focused upon underserved\/vulnerable populations
(e.g., pregnant women and their fetuses, adolescents, racial or ethnic
minorities, women\/gender\n        issues, subjects within the criminal
justice system) are especially encouraged.    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n
        2.   Development of a Test\/Device to More Effectively
Diagnose\/Manage Patients with SRDs.  This solicitation aims to support
the\n        identification and development of an innovative
test\/device that can be used to help more effectively diagnose and\/or
manage patients with SRDs. The\n        use of this novel diagnostic
tool might help to: (1) expedite the development of-, and\/or (2)
enhance existing treatments for patients with SRDs.\n    \n    \n    \n
   \n              Possible diagnostic tests\/devices that a small
business might consider, but are not limited to, include:\n    \n    \n
   \n    \n        \u00b7         An assay\/device (e.g., skin sensors,
oral swabs) that detects a substance of abuse more reliably than
oft-used urinalysis. Optimally, the\n        analytical test\/device
would be non-invasive and easy-to-use, such that it could be used on an
outpatient basis.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \u00b7
Discovery\/development of a diagnostic test\/screen that could help
physicians more effectively manage treatments for patients with SRDs.
\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   Discovery \/ Development of
Biomarkers Related to SRD Treatment Outcomes.  Because drug addiction is
 a brain disease which can change the\n        structure and function of
 the brain, there is a unique opportunity to develop biomarkers that
could reliably predict\/assess SRD treatment outcome. To\n        date,
evaluations of SRDs often utilize subjective measures (e.g.,
patient-reported questionnaires) to assess disease progression and
primary treatment\n        outcomes. Biomarkers represent a more
objective measure of physiological functioning that can be used to
predict, diagnose, evaluate the progression\n        of, and\/or more
accurately assess overall treatment safety and effectiveness.\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n              The goal of this initiative is to support
the small business discovery\/development of reproducible, quantitative
biomarkers related to SRD\n        treatment outcomes. Potential
biomarkers might be derived from underlying variations in DNA, gene
expression, proteins, metabolism, and\/or neuroimages,\n        among
others.         \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        4.   Creation of a
Data Repository\/Software Tool for SRD-related Clinical Research Data.
Clinical data management is currently heterogeneous.\n        Different
investigators use different nomenclatures, definitions, timeframes,
data-collection instruments, data analysis and reporting methods. This\n
        varied (and often inadequate) data management system severely
limits the interpretation of results from clinical trials and
complicates the ability to\n        make data-based decisions concerning
 the overall effectiveness of a therapeutic intervention. Appropriate
collection and standardization of clinical\n        trial data should
permit, for example, more statistically-valid comparisons of treatment
outcomes and data integration, meta-analysis, and aid in the\n
development of more effective, individualized clinical treatments for
patients with SRDs.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n              The purpose
of this initiative is to support small business development of
repository\/software tool that can be used to more efficiently capture\n
        and manage (i.e., facilitate\/standardize collection, storage,
screen\/analyze, report) data obtained from NIDA-funded clinical
trials.\nCollection\/storage of these data should follow HIPAA
guidelines (        http:\/\/www.hhs.gov\/ocr\/privacy\/index.html) to
guarantee the privacy and\n        confidentiality of all study
participants.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Kristopher Bough, Ph.D.\n

        "description": "\n    \n    \n    \n        A.    Behavioral and
 Integrative Treatment Branch.  The Behavioral and Integrative Treatment
 Branch is interested in research on behavioral and\n        integrative
 treatments for drug abuse and addiction. The term "behavioral
treatments" is used in a broad sense and includes various forms of\n
    psychotherapy, behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, family therapy,
couples and marital therapy, group therapy, skills training, meditation,
 guided\n        imagery, counseling, and rehabilitative therapies. The
term, \u201cIntegrative treatments\u201d refers to treatments that
combine behavioral interventions with\n        other treatments,
including other behavioral therapies, medications, and\/or
complementary\/alternative therapies. Behavioral and integrative
treatment\n        research has been conceptualized to consist of three
stages. Stage I, or early treatment development, involves research on
the development, refinement,\n        and pilot testing of behavioral
and integrative interventions. Stage I may include translational
research that incorporates concepts, methods or\n        findings from
other disciplines (e.g., neuroscience, cognitive science, etc.) into the
 development of behavioral and integrative treatments. Stage I\n
may also include research to develop or adapt treatments to become more
\u201ccommunity-friendly.\u201d Stage II includes testing treatments
that show promise\n        and testing the \u201cdose-response\u201d of
treatments. Stage III is research aimed at determining if and how
efficacious behavioral treatments may be\n        transported to
community settings. Stage III may include studies that test treatments
in community settings, with community therapists. Stage III may\n
 also include studies that develop or test methods of training treatment
 providers to administer treatments. Determination of mechanism of
action of\n        treatment is relevant to all three stages. Specific
areas of interest include:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.
Translation from Basic Behavioral or Cognitive Science.  \u201cStage
I\u201d research on the development of behavioral therapies or
components of\n        such therapies that are based on developments and
 findings from the basic behavioral or cognitive sciences.\n    \n    \n
    \n    \n        2.   Translation of Cognitive, Affective and Social
Neuroscience Findings Towards Development of Behavioral Treatments.
\u201cStage I\u201d research on\n        the development of behavioral
treatments or components of such therapies that are based on
developments and findings from cognitive, affective, or\n        social
neuroscience. For example, one may wish to apply findings on the neural
underpinnings of adolescent risk-taking behaviors to target the\n
 developmental needs of substance using youth, or apply findings on the
link between early adversity and the impairment of emotion regulatory
abilities\n        to address the needs of substance using victims of
childhood abuse.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   Treatment of
Sleep Disorders for Individuals in Drug Abuse Treatment.  Recent
research on sleep has shed new light on its importance to\n
psychological and physical health. Sleep deprivation has been linked
with impaired cognitive performance, negative mood, and even decreased
immune\n        function. Drug abusers often cite insomnia as reason for
 relapse, and may use drugs to modulate their sleep\/waking cycles.
However, the treatment of\n        sleep disorders has not been a
primary focus of drug abuse treatment research. The development and
testing of sleep hygiene interventions, alone or in\n        combination
 with behavioral interventions, for use in conjunction with drug abuse
treatment, as a means of improving treatment for drug abuse is\n
needed. Developmentally and age appropriate, as well as gender sensitive
 treatment of sleep disorders could impact on the development of more
effective\n        treatment interventions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

  \n        4.   Modifying Efficacious Behavioral Treatments to be
Community Friendly.  Several behavioral interventions have been found to
 be efficacious\n        for the treatment of drug addiction. However,
there are barriers to implementation of behavioral treatments in
community-based settings. Community\n        settings that treat drug
addicted individuals are reluctant or unwilling to adopt these
interventions for a variety of reasons. Reasons that\n
scientifically-based behavioral treatments are not accepted by community
 providers could include the excessive cost of implementation, the
length of\n        time for administration of treatment, inadequate
training available for therapists and counselors, treatments not shown
to be generalizable for\n        different patient populations or for
polydrug abusing populations, etc. Research aimed at modifying
efficacious behavioral treatments to make them more\n        acceptable
to community settings is needed. Settings might include, drug abuse
treatment facilities, primary care, managed care, after-school or\n
   classroom settings, colleges, and the criminal and juvenile justice
system. Examples of possible studies are those that are designed to
reduce the cost\n        of treatments, reduce the time of
administration of treatments, aid in training of therapists, counselors
and nurses, adapt individual therapies for\n        group situations,
etc.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.   Treatments to Prevent
Escalation from Abuse to Dependence.  Therapies for drug abusers who are
 not yet dependent on drugs to reduce risk\n        of escalation to
dependence and therapies for drug abusers who have not considered or
claim little interest in seeking treatment for their drug\n
problems are needed. Treatments for participants in their natural
environment, such as treatments delivered over the Internet, cell phone,
 or in\n        neighborhood settings such as churches and recreation
centers are desired. A particular focus on treatments which incorporate
engagement strategies for\n        hard to interest groups are
requested. Educational games, interactive video content, fluency based
learning approaches and other methods to help\n        maintain
involvement are encouraged.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        6.
Virtual Reality Applications for Drug Abuse.  Development and
improvement of treatments using Virtual Reality and other new
simulation\n        technologies is needed. New technology may help to
make existing treatments more effective, or may make novel treatments
possible. Behavioral treatment\n        research to develop, modify,
adapt, and test treatments for drug abuse and for co-morbid psychiatric
conditions (such as anxiety disorders) using new\n        technologies
is of interest.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n              Recently virtual
reality simulations have been used to train medical personnel in
demanding medical procedures such as microsurgery techniques.\n
Virtual training allows trainees to gain familiarity with both the
environment in which services are delivered as well as the intervention
techniques\n        without the danger of mistakes impacting live
patients. Virtual reality interfaces can assess skill acquisition and
provide detailed feedback during\n        procedures to help trainees
correct mistakes or avoid making them altogether. In the drug abuse
field, training and dissemination efforts have been\n        hampered by
 a dearth of knowledge about ways to conduct dissemination. Although
trainees often practice on actual clients, this approach has drawbacks\n
        including its reliance on the client or participant\u2019s
schedule and willingness to participate in training sessions and
potential danger to the client\n        or if the intervention is
delivered incorrectly. Libraries of virtual reality simulations of drug
users in treatment or \u201cvirtual patients\u201d are needed\n
to provide experiential training for treatment providers without relying
 on existing patients. This will help facilitate the rapid and
effective\n        dissemination of proven treatment strategies.\n    \n
    \n    \n    \n7.          Virtual Clinical Trials Settings for
Conducting Behavioral Treatment Trials and Addictions Treatment Provider
 Education Trials in Cyberspace.\n         Virtual communities such as
Second Life as well as private web forums offer a unique opportunity for
 behavioral therapy researchers and providers to\n        establish and
conduct online psychotherapy and behavioral therapy development research
 as well as a forum to develop provider \u201cuniversity\u2019s\u201d at
 which\n        various training techniques may be tested for
discovering the most efficacious way to deliver continuing education and
 other training in the latest\n        methods of treating addiction.
Applications are encouraged to develop such a forum and test either a
provider training or behavioral therapy method in\n        an online
trial. As part of this research platform, methods for obtaining consent,
 maintaining confidentiality, collecting data and where needed,\n
 assessing provider adherence and competence are expected.\n    \n    \n
    \n    \n        8.   Remote and\/or Mobile Abstinence and Identity
Verification.  Methods are needed for at home or mobile abstinence
verification which\n        include identity verification. Drug abuse
treatment researchers are in the process of developing web-based and
mobile phone based treatments which can\n        extend treatment beyond
 the clinic walls. Additionally, there is growing recognition by
providers that drug addiction is a chronic disease which may\n
require multiple bouts of treatment. However, currently there are no
means of monitoring abstinence once patients leave formal treatment or
validating\n        progress of patients undergoing treatment located
outside a clinic which provides onsite testing. Monitoring onsite
testing poses barriers to patient\n        privacy but unobserved sample
 donation may be subject to switching and adulterants. Products are
needed which both test for the presence of illicit\n        substances
and which accurately identify the donor of the sample and the time of
its submission so patients can participate in monitoring outside of\n
     formal treatment settings. Blood sampling similar in invasiveness
to a skin prick for diabetes testing or other low risk sampling of other
 tissues and\n        specimens may be acceptable. Scalability and
automation of methods are particularly desirable.\n    \n    \n    \n

Adherence to Medications and Treatment for Drug Abusers with HIV\/AIDS.
 The introduction of highly active antiretroviral\n        therapy
(HAART) has significantly changed HIV\/AIDS clinical care. There is a
need for research related to the development and testing of new and\n
     improved behavioral interventions(alone, and in combination with
pharmacological treatments for drug addiction), in order to facilitate
better\n        adherence to antiviral regimens among drug abusers with
HIV infection, including HIV positive drug abusers with comorbid medical
 illnesses and\/or\n        psychiatric disorders. There is also a need
to develop and test adherence interventions administered or assisted by
technological devices such as\n        computers, the internet, expert
system models, telephone pagers, or hand-held computers.\n    \n    \n
  \n    \n        10. Treatment for Emerging or Specific Populations.
Therapies designed to intervene with understudied populations including
users of\n        drugs such as methamphetamine, MDMA and other club
drugs, marijuana, inhalants, and prescription opioids and
psychostimulants, as well as children of\n        substance abusers in
need of treatment, and drug abusers with comorbid psychiatric disorders
and\/or medical illnesses such as HIV\/AIDS, hepatitis, etc.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        11. Development of HIV Risk Reduction
Interventions.  Research to develop and evaluate behavioral strategies
to reduce HIV risk behaviors in\n        HIV-positive and HIV-negative
substance abusing treatment populations. Where appropriate, risk
reduction interventions should be adapted to patients\u2019\n
age, gender, cultural background and potential cognitive impairments,
and should address compliance with medical regimens. The product of such
 research\n        might be training, supervision, or educational
materials, such as manuals or videotapes that describe the intervention
and its implementation by\n        treatment staff.\n    \n    \n    \n
   \n        12. Woman and Gender Differences in the Provision of
Behavioral Treatments, and HIV\/AIDS Risk Reduction Approaches.  Develop
 and\n        evaluate specific behavioral treatment approaches
targeting drug-addicted women. This may include behavioral therapies,
skills training techniques,\n        counseling strategies, and HIV and
other infectious disease behavioral risk reduction strategies. This may
also include development and testing of\n        training materials that
 specifically address women and gender differences in drug addiction
treatment to promote effective use of research-based\n        treatment
approaches. Training materials may involve treatment manuals, training
videos, CD ROM or DVD technologies, Internet or computer based\n
programs to manage aspects of treatment administration, or other
innovative educational strategies for health professionals using new
technologies.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        13. Behavioral Treatments
 Drawing from Stress Research or Stress-Management Interventions.
Projects are encouraged that apply concepts from\n        stress
research (such as appraisal, coping, and social support) to drug abuse
in innovative ways, or that test the extent to which stress-management\n
        interventions can be applied to the treatment of drug abuse and
interventions to reduce risk of HIV and other infectious diseases.
Examples of\n        stress-management techniques that may have novel
application to drug abuse and HIV risk include techniques that teach
problem-solving and\n        affect-management, restore one\u2019s sense
 of purpose and meaning, prevent burnout in the face of chronic
stressors, increase self-efficacy for managing\n        stress,
inoculate against stressors, train relaxation and meditation, intervene
during crises, enlist social support and system support, and others.\n
  \n    \n    \n    \n        14. Behavioral Strategies for Increasing
Medication Adherence.  Research to develop and to evaluate strategies to
 induce recovering addicts to\n        take medication for a prolonged
time, especially opioid antagonist naltrexone; partial opioid-agonist
buprenorphine, etc. to encourage HIV infected\n        drug users to
comply with medical treatments (HAART) in drug abuse treatment settings;
 or to adapt existing behavioral strategies to increase patient\n
 compliance and cooperation in long-term treatment for drug abuse or for
 diseases associated with drug abuse such as tuberculosis or hepatitis.
An\n        important consideration should be cost and practicality of
use in actual clinical practice or in an aftercare program. The product
of such research\n        might be a manual, which describes the
behavioral strategy, and its implementation by treatment staff or
scientific data regarding evaluation.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

 Behavioral Treatments and Pharmacotherapies.  Development of integrated
 behavioral treatments and pharmacotherapies may\n        enhance the
efficacy of both types of therapeutic interventions. For instance, the
maintenance and detoxification of heroin addicts could perhaps be\n
   optimized by the integration of distinctive behavioral treatments
devised specifically for opioid agonists, antagonists or partial
agonists determined\n        by the heterogeneity of the subgroup of
addicts and the pharmacological differences of the medications.
Integration of medications and behavioral\n        treatments could
possibly enhance compliance with medication regimens, increase retention
 allowing pharmacological effects to occur and\n        prevent relapse
to drug abuse and addiction.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        16.
Behavioral Treatment Research for Drug Abuse and Addiction in Primary
Care.  Recent research has shown that physicians and other\n
clinicians often fail to recognize drug abuse or addiction among their
primary care patients. In addition, a significant number of these
clinicians\n        reported that they did not know how to intervene
with their patients if drug abuse or addiction was suspected. Drug abuse
 related illnesses and\n        morbidity often occur in adults and may
have begun in adolescence. However, very little research has been done
to develop or test behavioral treatment\n        approaches or combined
pharmacological and behavioral treatments for drug abuse and addiction
in primary care settings. The objectives of this\n        initiative are
 to encourage research on the development and testing of innovative
behavioral treatment approaches e.g. screening and brief\n
interventions, use of web-based or mobile technologies used alone or in
combination with pharmacological treatments. Other goals of this
research\n        initiative are to encourage additional research on the
 development and validation of culturally sensitive screening and
assessment instruments for use\n        with youth and adults in primary
 care; and to encourage research on the transportability of efficacious
behavioral treatments to primary care settings,\n        as well as
research on science-based training approaches for changing primary care
clinicians' behaviors regarding their recognition and intervention\n
    with drug abusing or addicted patients. While motivational
enhancement approaches for some drug abusing populations have been found
 to be effective,\n        this behavioral approach has not been widely
used in primary care.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        17.\n        \n
          Using Telemedicine to Deliver Efficacious Treatment to
Underserved Populations in Specialty Addictions Treatment and\/or
General Medical Settings\n        \n        .\n         Telemedicine
programs are being used in urban medical centers to rapidly disseminate
science-based information on new medical treatments. In addition,\n
   approximately one-third of the rural hospitals are now using
telemedicine to improve patient care Studies are needed to modify
existing treatments\n        developed by NIDA researchers for
deployment and testing as telemedicine treatments at remote locations to
 underserved populations. These may be\n        delivered in any patient
 care context including primary care or specialty addiction treatment.
Modification of the treatment content to apply to the\n        remote
patient population and provider training materials to orient the onsite
staff who may not be experienced at delivering the new treatment may
be\n        needed.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        18. Youth Smoking
Cessation.  Smoking related illnesses usually occur in adults. However,
tobacco use and nicotine addiction generally begin\n        in childhood
 or adolescence. Despite health warnings, adolescents continue to
initiate smoking at alarming rates and the majority will continue to\n
      smoke as adults. Adolescents who begin to smoke, develop nicotine
dependence very quickly and exhibit withdrawal symptoms during quit
attempts in a\n        similar fashion to adults. Most adolescents who
smoke, express a desire to quite. To date, research on smoking cessation
 for teen and young adult\n        smokers has not been particularly
fruitful. This initiative requests research aimed at the development and
 testing of smoking cessation treatments\n        tailored to the
specific needs of adolescents and young adults. Consideration should
also be given to gender and ethnicity.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
19. Complementary and Alternative Medicine Therapies (CAM) for Drug
Abuse Treatment.  Research is encouraged on complementary and
alternative\n        interventions for drug abuse treatment either as
the sole treatment or as an adjunct to enhance the therapeutic potency
of existing drug abuse\n        treatments. Any of the five CAM
categories: Whole medical systems, mind-body interventions,
biologically-based therapies, Manipulative\/body-based\ntherapies and
energy therapies would be considered for this initiative (for more
information, see        http:\/\/nccam.nih.gov\/). CAM therapies are
interventions that are commonly used in \u201creal world\u201d\n
settings, but whose therapeutic efficacy has not been scientifically
demonstrated. The product of this research might also be a manual or
video, which\n        illustrates the intervention and how it is
implemented by treatment staff.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Geetha

    \n    \n        20. Developing, Evaluating, and Transporting
Culturally Sensitive Behavioral Treatments for Racial and Ethnic
Minorities.  Minority\n        populations are disproportionately
affected by the consequences of drug abuse. Research to develop and
evaluate behavioral treatments that are\n        culturally sensitive
and relevant for diverse racial and ethnic minority populations is
encouraged. This may include studies of behavioral treatments,\n
alone or in combination with pharmacological treatment, or studies of
behavioral strategies for increasing adherence to taking medications. In
 the\n        development and evaluation of the behavioral treatment,
attention needs to be directed at examining medical, social, and
cultural factors that may\n        influence adherence to the behavioral
 treatment approach and treatment outcome. Also, little is known about
the transportability of efficacious\n        behavioral treatments for
minority populations. Research is needed on how to transport
science-based treatments to various racial\/ethnic populations.\n    \n
   \n    \n    \n        21. Incorporating Smoking Cessation in Drug
Abuse Treatment.  Research is encouraged to develop and test behavioral
and combined\n        behavioral and pharmacological treatments for
nicotine-addicted individuals who also are addicted to other substances,
 such as heroin, cocaine,\n        methamphetamines and alcohol.
Prevalence of cigarette smoking is extremely high among drug dependent
individuals attending drug treatment. Many\n        treatment providers
are reluctant to address smoking cessation with clients either because
they believe that substance abusers are not interested in\n
quitting or because they fear smoking treatment will have a negative
impact on drug abuse treatment outcome. However, studies have shown that
 many drug\n        abuse clients are interested in quitting smoking and
 that the concurrent treatment of tobacco dependence and other drug
dependencies does not threaten\n        abstinence and might even assist
 in maintaining it. Research is needed to develop and test smoking
cessation treatments that can be incorporated into\n        treatments
for illicit drugs of abuse.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        22.
Developing Treatments for Smokers with Comorbid Disorders.  Research is
encouraged that focuses on the development, refinement,\n        and
testing of behavioral treatments for smokers with psychiatric
comorbidity, such as depression, schizophrenia, or anxiety disorders.
Smoking\n        prevalence is very high in individuals with psychiatric
 disorders. These populations generally respond poorly to traditional
smoking cessation\n        treatments. Similarly, medical comorbidities
are widely prevalent and are in need of additional research in adults
and in special populations such as\n        youth, LGBT and homeless
persons. Research is needed to develop and test innovative behavioral
and combined behavioral and pharmacological treatments\n        that
address the unique needs of these individuals.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
        23. Tobacco Cessation for Pregnant and Post-Partum Women.
Smoking among pregnant women remains an ongoing public health concern.
It is\n        estimated that approximately 20-30% of pregnant women
smoke. Maternal smoking during pregnancy has been linked to infant
mortality, impaired fetal\n        brain and nervous system development,
 premature and complicated births, and low birth-weight babies. For
women who do quit during pregnancy, relapse\n        rates vary, but are
 reported as approximately 25% before delivery, 50% within four months
postpartum, and 70-90% by one year postpartum. Children of\n
smokers continue to be at risk for respiratory illness, middle ear
infections, impaired lung function, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.
Sustained\n        tobacco cessation during pregnancy and the postpartum
 period reduces health risks to both mothers and their babies. Research
focused on the development\n        of innovative behavioral and
combined behavioral and pharmacological interventions for
nicotine-addicted pregnant and postpartum women is encouraged.\n
Interventions may be tailored to sub-populations of pregnant smokers,
such as teenage girls, heavy smokers, ethnic minorities, or low SES
populations.\n        Examples of other potential studies may include
the development of smoking cessation interventions that address
co-occurring issues, such as depression\n        or weight-gain,
interventions that include partners or support persons, Internet-based
interventions or interventions that can be delivered by primary\n
 care physicians.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        24  Behavioral
Treatments for Groups.  This includes the development of new
psychotherapy approaches, the modification or testing of existing\n
   behavioral treatments, and the design and\/or testing of innovative
clinical training and supervision methods for dissemination of
efficacious\n        treatments to community settings. Examples of
relevant projects are: traditional group therapies, such as 12-step and
therapeutic community approaches,\n        and newer group therapies
such as cognitive-behavioral and acceptance-oriented approaches; groups
for various populations, such as adolescents, adults,\n        couple
and family groups, gender-specific groups, and groups tailored for
racial or ethnic minority populations. Of particular interest are
projects\n        that address the recent reports suggesting possible
contraindications of group treatments for some populations (e.g.,
delinquent adolescents), or in\n        some formats (e.g.,
less-structured, client-led groups).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

\n        25. Developing Behavioral Treatments for Cognitively Impaired
Drug Abusers.  While there are currently many efficacious
interventions\n        available for drug addicted individuals in
treatment, more can potentially be done to enhance treatments by
addressing cognitive impairments that may\n        accompany chronic
drug use and HIV infection. Many commonly utilized drug addiction and
HIV-risk reduction interventions assume certain basic cognitive\n
 capacities and abilities that may be absent, or impaired, in chronic
drug abusers who may also be HIV-positive. For substance abusers to
benefit from\n        psychological treatment, they must be capable of
attending to and receiving new information, integrating it with existing
 information stores, and\n        translating this input into more
concrete behavioral change. Substance abusers with cognitive
limitations, who may not comprehend the interventions,\n        are more
 likely to drop out of treatment, relapse faster, and have poorer
long-term outcomes in comparison to cognitively intact substance
abusers.\n        Research is needed to develop, modify, and test
\u201ccognitive-friendly\u201d drug dependence treatments that could
lead to improved treatment response and\n        outcome.\n    \n    \n
   \n    \n        26. Interventions to Improve Engagement and Retention
 in Treatment.  Therapies designed specifically to engage and retain
individuals in\n        treatment, especially those at high risk for
HIV. An example could be a therapy that is: (1) sensitive to the age and
 motivational level of the client;\n        (2) is specifically designed
 to respond to the needs of the individual, whatever his or her
developmental and motivational level might be; and (3)\n        actively
 works to increase an individual's desire to remain in treatment.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        27. Development of New or Improved Addiction
 Assessment Measures and Procedures.  Research directed at the
improvement of a currently\n        available measure or the design of a
 new psychosocial, social or environmental measure appropriate for use
in the clinical assessment of youth and\n        adult substance abusing
 populations. Special consideration should be given to a specific
screening or diagnostic tool, or to a specific measure of\n
treatment readiness, treatment compliance, service utilization,
therapeutic process or drug treatment outcome.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
        28. Marijuana Treatment.  Marijuana is the most commonly used
illicit substance in the U.S. However, relative to other drugs of abuse,
 little\n        research has focused on the treatment of marijuana
dependence. Trends in the literature suggest that the types of
treatments effective with other\n        substances of abuse are likely
to be effective with marijuana dependence. Initial studies also suggest
that many patients do not show a positive\n        treatment response,
indicating that marijuana dependence is not easily treated. Research is
needed toward developing and testing effective\n        interventions
for marijuana dependent individuals.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
29. Transporting Behavioral Treatments to Community Practitioners.
There is a need for effective methods of transferring behavioral\n
  treatments found to be effective in Stage I clinical trials to
clinical practice. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, operant behavioral
therapy, group\n        therapy, and family therapy are among the
therapies that have been shown to be efficacious in a highly controlled
setting and may be helpful treatment\n        approaches in community
treatment programs as well. However, community practitioners may have
been trained using other approaches and may not have been\n
exposed to these scientifically based approaches. Emphasis should be
placed on examining mechanisms to transfer effective research-based drug
 abuse\n        treatment information and skills-based techniques to
practitioners in the community. This may involve the development and
testing of innovative\n        training materials and procedures to use
in the training of community practitioners to skillfully administer
these treatments, including the\n        development of highly
innovative technology transfer and communication approaches. Research
testing the transportability of empirically supported\n        therapies
 to the community is an important component of the Behavioral and
Integrative Treatment Development Program.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
          There is also a need for the development of educational
methods to train non-drug abuse health care workers in relating to drug
abusers;\n        eliciting medical histories regarding past or present
drug abuse; recognition of the signs and symptoms of drug abuse;
identification of those at\n        high-risk for HIV and other drug
abuse related medical problems such as tuberculosis or hepatitis.
Development and validation of a drug abuse screening\n        instrument
 which can be administered by primary health care providers, and
training in administering such an instrument is also needed.\n    \n

Modules for Specific Problems or Populations.  Discrete therapy
components that address specific problems common among drug\n
addicted individuals and that can be implemented in conjunction with
other therapeutic services. For example, an investigator may wish to
develop a\n        four session, highly focused, job seeking skills
module that can be easily implemented by a wide range of practitioners
to effectively increase\n        appropriate job seeking behavior. Other
 examples include, but are not limited to, modules to engage ambivalent
drug dependent individuals in treatment,\n        modules to increase
assertiveness in female drug addicts who feel pressured by others to use
 drugs, modules to improve study skills and pro-social\n
interactions among withdrawn substance abusing adolescents, or to
incorporate effective HIV risk reduction techniques.\n    \n    \n    \n
    \n        31. Behavioral Treatments for Pre-Adolescents and
Adolescents.  Developmentally appropriate behavioral treatments for
pre-adolescents and\n        adolescents that incorporate HIV risk
reduction counseling as an integral component of the treatment. This
includes the development of new, or\n        refinement of existing
psychotherapies, behavioral therapies, and counseling (group and\/or
individual). This also includes the development and testing\n        of
manuals as well as other creative, interactive approaches for therapy
delivery that may consider different settings for delivery, such as
primary\n        care, school-based health programs, juvenile justice
settings, etc. Also the behavioral treatments should be culturally and
gender sensitive.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        32. Behavioral
Treatments for Couples and Families.  This includes the development of
new psychotherapy approaches, the modification\n        or testing of
existing behavioral treatments, and the design and\/or testing of
innovative clinical training and supervision methods for dissemination\n
        of efficacious treatments to community settings, for youth and
adult substance users. Treatments that target domestic violence or other
 forms of\n        interpersonal abuse along with substance abuse are
encouraged.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        33. Innovative Technologies
 for Drug Abuse Treatment, HIV Risk Reduction, and Training Clinicians.
 Relevant research would be\n        directed at the development and
evaluation of innovative technologies to treat substance abuse, enhance
adherence to medications, and\/or reduce risk\n        for HIV infection
 or transmission. Approaches should be capable of being readily
incorporated at reasonable cost into various treatment settings. Areas\n
        of interest include Internet-based treatment or training
programs, CD-ROM technology, audio delivery devices, photo therapeutic
instruments, and\n        hand-held computers. Also of interest are
creative approaches for disseminating science-based behavioral
treatments and for training therapists to use\n        scientifically
based treatments for drug abuse and addiction. Such approaches might
include Internet-based education, interactive computer programs,\n
  telemedicine, etc. Finally, approaches which apply therapies with
evidence of efficacy through new media such as web-based platforms, over
 email, or\n        through chat rooms and bullet boards are also
desirable.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Jessica Chambers, Ph.D.\n

Clinical Neuroscience Research.  The Clinical Neuroscience Branch (CNB)
supports research on the biological etiology (determining the
biological\n        basis for vulnerability to drug abuse and
progression to addiction, including studies on individual differences
and genetics) and clinical neurobiology\n        of addiction (exploring
 alterations of the structure and\/or function of the human central
nervous system following acute or chronic exposure of drugs\n        of
abuse), and the neurobiology of development (neurobiological effects of
drugs of abuse and addiction during various stages of development and\n
       maturation, effects of drug exposure on neurobiological
processes, development of methodologies and refinement of techniques
used in pediatric\n        neuroimaging). The Branch also supports
investigations on the cognitive neuroscience of drug abuse and
addiction, the neurobiology of treatment,\n        neuroAIDS, and human
pain and analgesia. Areas that may be of interest to small businesses
include, but are not limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.
Innovative Technology and Tools for Human Substance Abuse Research.
There is a continuing need for the development of methods, tools,\n
   and technology that can be used as markers of or interventions for
brain, genetic or behavioral (including cognitive and affective)
alterations in\n        humans related to the risk, or reliance
(etiology) of, effects of, or recovery from substance abuse. NIDA has a
strong interest in facilitating the\n        identification and use of
cross-disciplinary research tools and materials that can be applied to
human research that will advance our understanding\n        drug abuse.
NIDA also has a strong interest in promoting the commercial adaptation
and widespread availability of discoveries (\u201ctools\u201d) made in
the\n        course of interdisciplinary research to better serve its
mission.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n              The term research
\u201ctool" is being used in its broadest sense to embrace the full
range of resources that scientists use in the laboratory and\n
clinicians use as therapeutics; therefore, one investigator\u2019s tool
may be another's end product. The value of research tools is difficult
to assess and\n        varies greatly from one tool to the next and from
 one situation to the next. Providers and users are likely to differ in
their assessments of the value\n        of research tools. Many research
 and clinical tools are costly to develop and have significant
competitive value to the firms that own them.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
             Of particular interest are methods that could be used to
determine the effects of drug abuse\/ addiction treatments on
neurobiological systems in\n        an attempt to understand the
neurobiological processes underlying risk and recovery. Also of interest
 are methods and tools that can be integrated or\n        expend with
brain imaging techniques or other brain-related measures that can be
used in human subjects.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n              Examples
include, but are not limited to; Development of stimulus-generating
hardware and\/or software for use in substance abuse studies,\n
including neurocognitive tasks, presentation of drug-related images for
the induction of craving or to probe attentional or affective processes,
 and\n        \u201cvirtual reality\u201d types of dynamic stimuli
important in studies of drug abuse and addiction; Remote and mobile
based technologies such as PDA\u2019s, \u201csmart\n
phones\u201d, or web-based applications for measuring cognitive and
affective function in real world environments; Development or
implementation of\n        interventions such as trans-cranial or direct
 current brain stimulation, real-time neurofeedback, or cognitive
training; New infomatic tools for\n        primary data analysis or
secondary data analysis would also be appropriate;\n    \n    \n    \n
  \n              Another example would be methods or technology related
 to development of the human central nervous system and how drugs of
abuse perturb this\n        process. Developmental studies of these
populations presents unique challenges when using neuroimaging
technology. The development of novel techniques,\n        or the
refinement of existing methods, to provide direct noninvasive measures
of brain structure and\/or function that are adapted specifically for
use\n        in pediatric and adolescent populations is strongly
encouraged. Also, neurocognitive and other neurobehavioral tasks for use
 in these populations,\n        especially where they can be designed to
 probe underlying neurobiological processes, need to be developed (for
developmental issues, contact Cheryl\n        Boyce, Ph.D.).\n    \n

Neurochemical and Molecular Imaging.  Measurement of brain
neurochemistry, neuropharmacology (receptors) and gene expression\n
   in humans using non-invasive imaging has lagged behind advances in
these areas in pre-clinical research as well as in functional and
anatomical\n        neuroimaging in humans. There is a continuing need
for development of new ways to measure molecular targets in the human
brain. Examples include, but\n        are not limited to novel
radioligands for PET and SPECT imaging in human brain for molecular
targets (e.g., receptors, intracellular messengers,\n
disease-related proteins), as well as novel methods that use magnetic
resonance imaging or other emerging technologies such as optical
imaging.. The\n        primary application of these methods will be in
basic human research. Ultimately, these measures may also be used as
potential biological markers and\n        surrogate endpoints for
translational and clinical research, drug discovery and development, and
 clinical trials. The scope of the projects may\n        encompass pilot
 or clinical feasibility evaluation in pre-clinical studies, model
development, or clinical studies. Alternatively, the focus may be on\n
      research and development of new technologies for molecular,
neurochemical or neuropharmacological development.\n    \n    \n    \n

Neuro-Rehabilitation of Drug-Induced Cognitive Deficiencies.  The
increased awareness that the brain is capable of substantial\n
plasticity throughout the lifespan has opened the possibility that
intervention can be developed alter brain or cognitive function so as to
 accelerate\n        recovery of brain and cognitive dysfunction. Such
interventions encompass both direct interventions of brain function as
well as indirect interventions\n        based on cognitive or behavioral
 principles.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n              Direct interventions
 include trans-cranial or direct current brain stimulation, real-time

          Another complementary approach is based on game technology for
 \u201cserious (health-related) rather than purely recreational
purposes. Serious games\n        can provide a completely controlled,
noninvasive, safe and alternative methodology for a variety of important
 studies of drug abuse and addiction. By\n        involving a person in
an interactive computerized situation, designed to be both entertaining
yet directive (i.e., in the sense of covertly shaping\n        desired
behaviors via highly flexible and programmable sets of scenarios),
altered behaviors can be introduced by pre-programming consequences to\n
        counteract and potentially reset undesirable neurobiological and
 neurobehavioral deficits associated with chronic drug abuse.\n    \n

related to substance abuse that could be enhanced through the use of
either direct brain interventions,\n        or \u201cserious\u201d games
 include diminished decision-making ability, attention\/concentration
deficits, attentional biases, lack of cognitive flexibility and\n
 problem solving abilities, inability to use feedback to monitor\/change
 behavior, memory impairments,.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Steven

 Abuse.  There is the need for development, improvement and\/or
adaptation of\n        precise and reliable field deployable measurement
 technologies can detect and quantify an individual\u2019s exposure to
psychosocial stress and\/or one or\n        more drugs. Ideally, the
technology could be scalable from selected samples to full population
studies. Comprehensive assessment includes measuring\n
acute\/chronic\/cumulative exposures to psychosocial stress and\/or
addictive substances with a high degree of temporal and spatial
resolution (i.e., as a\n        person moves through environments), and
with a high degree of accuracy and sensitivity to detect meaningful
variations in extent of and response to\n        exposure across
developmental periods (ranging from prenatal to senescence) and among
various population groups. Such technologies may include use of\n
 emerging remote and mobile technologies such as PDA\u2019s, \u201csmart
 phones\u201d, or web-based applications.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

NIEHS mission is the ability to quantify an individual\u2019s exposure,
as well as the unique characteristics that account for\n
individualized responses to the exposures. The goal for improved
exposure assessment is to develop new technology and assays to generate
precise\n        measurements of human exposure to chemical and
biological agents that may lead to disease or dysfunction. The desired
application of these technologies\n        and assays is in
population-based (epidemiological) or clinical research and practice. An
 emphasis is placed on tools that provide individual exposure\n
metrics either at the point of contact or through measuring internal
dose of environmental agents.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        It is
anticipated that the new technologies and assays, such as those based on
 micro- and nanotechnology and molecular imaging, may provide
sensitive,\n        high-throughput, and potentially portable systems
capable of measuring exposure to environmental agents and the impact of
the exposures on human\n        biology.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  1.  Wearable Technologies for Personal Exposure Assessment at the
Point of Contact\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        The NIEHS is
interested in developing and validating new products\/devices, tools,
assays to improve our ability to precisely measure an
individual\u2019s\n        exposure to environmental agents, with high
temporal and spatial resolution. Ideally, the technologies, tools and
assays will be of appropriate scale\n        to be field deployable
and\/or wearable. These point-of-contact devices should be capable of
measuring simultaneously and in near real time, multiple\n        agents
 within a single exposure class (e.g., multiple types of metals,
multiple size fractions of particulate matter, multiple components of
diesel\n        exhaust) and\/or multiple agents across more than one
exposure class. Exposures of interest include ozone, particulate matter,
 diesel exhaust, metals\n        (e.g., arsenic, cadmium, or mercury),
volatile organic compounds, polybrominated diphenyls (PBDEs), polycyclic
 aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),\n        mold\/microbial toxins,

Internal Dose of Environmental Agents\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
The NIEHS is interested in developing technologies and devices to
generate precise measurements of internal dose of individual
environmental agents and\n        or their metabolites in real time and
over time. It would be especially valuable to analyze internal dose over
 time of multiple agents within a single\n        class or multiple
agents across more than one class. The development of a modular design
allowing measurement of specific classes of chemical exposures\n
for application in epidemiological studies (e.g., pesticides,
endocrine-active chemicals, or components of indoor air pollution) is
preferred.\n        Likewise, an emphasis is placed on measuring
environmental factors with mixed routes of exposure (i.e., inhalation,
ingestion, and dermal exposure) for\n        which biomonitoring is the
only comprehensive exposure metric.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n

lower animal species (e.g., fish, worms) to evaluate mechanisms of
toxicity to identify mechanisms of chemically-induced biological\n
  activity, prioritize chemicals for more extensive toxicological
evaluation, and develop more predictive models of in vivo biological\n

completion of the HGP in 2003 set the stage for making use of the
immense potential inherent in knowledge of the complete DNA sequence\nof
 the human genome to be applied for the improvement of human health and
well-being. In an effort to outline a path forward, the Vision Document (
        Nature 422,835-847 (2003)) broadly outlined three areas that
need to\n        be addressed: (1) elucidating the structure and
function of genomes; (2) translating genome-based knowledge into health
benefits; and (3) promoting the\n        use of genomics to maximize
benefits and minimize harms. The latter area relates closely to
NHGRI\u2019s Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI)\n
Program. The research topics encompassed by this area have traditionally
 been included in a separate program announcement. However, given the
growing\n        interrelatedness of genomics to research in humans and
to applications in health care and other settings, it has become
increasingly clear that the\n        investigation of ELSI issues cannot
 be separated from the genomic research that generates these issues. As a
 result, the ELSI research agenda is\n        described in this
NHGRI-wide announcement, as well as in a separate ELSI-specific Program
Announcement\n

\n    \n    \n    \n        The purpose of this document is to provide
information to investigators about the breadth of NHGRI\u2019s research
interests and is very similar the\nInstitute\u2019s general funding
opportunity announcements (http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/
guide\/pa-files\/PA-07-458.html and
http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/pa-files\/PA-07-459.html). When
appropriate,\n        NHGRI will publish Requests for Applications that
will be used to stimulate research in specific areas, to fill gaps in
research knowledge, or to\n        generate community resources that
will further the mission of genomics or ELSI research.\n    \n    \n

development in DNA sequencing and genotyping are examples of activities

potentiated the development of new community resource data sets. Many
areas of critical\n        importance to the realization of the

technological and methodological developments\n        before pilots and

 identification of the\n        genetic contributions to health,

Science",
        "description": "\n    \n    \n    \n        Through research in
neuroscience and basic behavioral science we can gain an understanding
of the fundamental mechanisms underlying thought, emotion,\n        and
behavior and an understanding of what goes wrong in the brain in mental
illness. Research sponsored by the Division of Neuroscience and Basic\n
       Behavioral Science covers a broad range of neuroscience topics:
from both experimental and theoretical approaches, from molecules to
whole brains to\n        populations of individuals, from single cell
organisms to humans, from across the entire lifespan, and from states of
 health and disease. This division\n        also supports research on
the basic behavioral, psychological, and social processes that underlie
normal behavioral functioning. The topics listed\n        below reflect
the NIMH interest in technologies related to this broad range, but
should not be considered a complete list. Prospective applicants are\n
      strongly encouraged to contact Dr. Margaret Grabb (listed below)
with questions about the relevance of their interests to the mission of
this division.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        A.    Cutting-Edge
Technologies for Neuroscience Research. Most of the research topics
listed after this one are posed from the Division's neuroscience\n
  and basic behavioral science mission-oriented perspective, however,
the technologies that might be developed to address those mission goals
might be\n        quite fundamental. Prospective applicants familiar
with such technologies, but not familiar with the mission-related use of
 these technologies, are\n        strongly encouraged to contact Dr.
Margaret Grabb (listed below) for assistance in bridging this gap
between their technical knowledge and knowledge of\n        the
neuroscience-related mission of NIMH. Technologies and approaches that
might be used in products relevant to this mission include, but are
not\n        limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Caged
Molecules. These chemical entities could be activated, or could release
an active agent, when specified bonds are broken by\n        chemical,
biochemical, photic, or other means. Among other uses, such molecules
could be used to indicate biochemical or physiological processes or to\n
        deliver pharmacologic substances to highly localized brain
regions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Genetically Engineered
Proteins. Such proteins could be put to any number of uses, including to
 express a fluorophore or chromophore at\n        the occurrence of
specific biochemical processes to report the time and location of such
processes in brain tissue.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.
Inducible Gene Expression. Methods to turn on or off expression of
particular genes in animals on the basis of time in the lifespan,\n
   location in the brain, or other factors. Such a capability would
significantly advance basic brain research, and would have important
implications for\n        treatment and therapy of mental illness.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        4.   Combinatorial Approaches. These are
high-through-put approaches that can be used to screen and synthesize
molecules that affect brain\n        cells.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
     5.   Biocompatible Biomaterials. Such research and development
relates to the chronic use of electrodes and other probes used in
brain\n        research, as well as implanted drug delivery devices.\n
  \n    \n    \n    \n        6.   Nanotechnologies. This emerging area
of technology presents a wide range of opportunities for brain research,
 from the fabrication of\n        probes to monitor brain physiology to
novel means of delivering drugs and other substances.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        7.   Informatics Tools. Such technologies allow brain
scientists, clinicians and theorists to make better sense and use of
their data. These\n        tools and approaches include those to
acquire, store, visualize, analyze, integrate, synthesize and share
data, including those for electronic\n        collaboration.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        8.   Simulation Technologies. Computer-based,
biologically realistic simulations of parts of neurons, neurons, and
circuits.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        9.   Mathematical,
Statistical and Computer Algorithms. Such algorithms could be used to
analyze large and\/or complex data sets. Examples of\n        these data
 sets include those derived from multiple, single-unit recording studies
 and functional imaging studies. Among other applications, these\n
  could be used to segment images (obtained from electron or light
microscopes, or from volumetric imaging instruments such as confocal
microscopes and\n        magnetic resonance imagers), filter noise,
visualize data or search vast data sets for specified patterns or data
(e.g., use of pattern recognition\n        algorithms to search time
series data sets obtained from electrophysiological recording of neural
activity, or video data obtained from behavioral\n        analysis of
genetically altered animals). In addition, digital reconstruction of
dendritic and axonal arbors would be of interest.\n    \n    \n    \n
 \n        10. Telemetry. Transferring data from one point to another is
 important for neuroscientists monitoring the physiological signals from
 the\n        brain. Telemetry, even over relatively short distances
(from a few millimeters to a few meters), could, for example, provide a
means to obtain data\n        from awake, behaving animals without
interfering with the behavior of interest. Examples include telemetry
that can be easily implanted\/attached to\n        awake behaving
animals for measuring peripheral\/autonomic responses (this approach
could be used to inform stress\/emotion research), miniaturized\n
 telemetry for use in smaller animals with increased numbers of
recording devices\/electrodes implanted per animal. Alternatives to
telemetry would be\n        considered as well.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        11. Biosensors. Neurons communicate with each other through
thousands of different chemical substances; internally, molecular
pathways direct\n        the function of the neuron. Sensors of high
specificity and sensitivity for such substances would provide
neuroscientists with important new ways to\n        study the brain.\n
  \n    \n    \n    \n        B.    Instrumentation for Basic
Neuroscience Research. Modern equipment that uses the most recent
technological advances is needed in neuroscience\n        research so
that neural substrates of mental illness can be identified and
localized. The NIMH is interested in supporting research and development
 of\n        new or improved approaches relevant to, but not limited to,
 the following:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Neurophysiology.
Microelectrodes for stimulation and\/or recording, smart nanoscaffolds,
macroelectrodes, biocompatible coatings,\n        interfaces to
electronics, software for data analysis, visualization, etc. Systems
with better\/easier MR compatibility would also be of interest.\n    \n
   \n    \n    \n        2.   Cell Sorting. Based on cell size, type,
function, morphology, abnormal features, specific membrane proteins,
etc.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   In Vivo Electrochemical
Voltammetry. More sensitive and selective electrodes, software for data
analysis, etc.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        4.   High Performance
Liquid Chromatography. Improved reliability, specificity, sensitivity,
etc.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.   Technology to support
Multiple Unit Recording Electrode Arrays. Recording techniques, analysis
 techniques and raw data storage.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        6.
Physiological and Behavioral Monitoring. Temperature, activity, sleep
duration, neuronal activity, EEG activity, EKG, pulse rate,\n
recording, capture and analysis of multiple single unit activity from
microelectrodes, automated SWS analysis and coherence of EEG rhythms,
and further\n        refinement of High density EEGs.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        7.   Development of novel technologies for stimulating
specific cells or signaling pathways in awake behaving animals.\n    \n
   \n    \n    \n        8.   Development of more sensitive fluorescent
probes for simultaneous and real time measures of multiple
neurotransmitter release and intracellular\n        signaling pathway
activities.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        9.   Associated Software.\n
    \n    \n    \n    \n        C.    Macroscopic Neuroimaging. Modern
technologies allow for the observation of the structure and function of
the intact brain. This capability has\n        the potential to greatly
advance understanding of the brain in both health and disease, and
across the lifespan. NIMH is interested in advancing this\n        area
of technology through enhancing current tools and approaches, as well as
 developing entirely new ways to image the brain. All modalities are
of\n        interest, including, but not limited to: magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) or spectroscopy, positron emission tomography (PET),
optical imaging or\n        spectroscopy, single photon emission
computed tomography, magnetoencephalography (MEG), diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI), etc. While not an imaging\n        technique itself,
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an associated, important
technology. TMS can be used in combination with fMRI as means to\n
  further assess physiology and integrity of neural systems both in
health and in mental disorders. Due to its greatly increased use in
recent years,\n        technologies specifically focused on improving
the utility and specificity of fMRI techniques are of particular
interest.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Innovative agents
and\/or technologies to visualize brain connectivity, activity, and
neural plasticity in situ with minimal invasion.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        2.   Improvement in the techniques, the design and
construction of devices for non-invasive imaging for any modality, for
example, improving spatial\n        resolution, quantitative accuracy,
signal-to-noise ratio, and electronics.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
 3.   Development and enhancement of non-invasive imaging techniques for
 evaluating alterations in brain physiology produced by drugs. These
would\n        include techniques for monitoring changes in regional
blood flow; concentrations of drug and\/or tissue metabolites; and the
distribution and activity\n        of receptors.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        4.   Synthesis, or isolation from natural products, of highly
selective receptor ligands or indicators of neurochemical processes,
which would be\n        labeled for imaging by one or more particular
modality.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.   Development of selective
 hormone receptor ligands for brain imaging.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
      6.   Development of imaging agents to examine the integrity of the
 blood brain barrier following infection and other environmental
challenges.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        7.   New approaches in
radiochemistry that will permit more exact identification of the
chemical changes associated with behavioral states (e.g., sleep\n
 or arousal) or mental illness as observed with any particular
neuroimaging modality.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        8.   Synthesis
of molecules containing stable, rarely occurring isotopes designed to be
 detected by non-invasive imaging techniques (e.g.,\n
fluorine-containing molecules, carbon-13 labeled substrates).\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n        9.   Methods and associated products for
quantification of imaging data including new statistical approaches for
evaluating the data.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        10. Methods to
integrate routines for greater and more precise computer enhancement of
the images, and for combining or overlaying images obtained from\n
  multiple modalities.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        11. Software
needed for the precise quantification of data obtained from these
imaging techniques with emphasis on the reliable definition of
discrete,\n        anatomically distinct areas within the brain.\n    \n
    \n    \n    \n        12. Novel agents or other tools to increase
the ability to correlate features of MR images with histological
features (e.g., cytoarchitecture or\n        chemoarchitecture) both
identified and those yet to be identified.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
    13. Generation of physiologic measurements from images of regional
radioactivity generated during PET, especially for the study of brain\n
       neurotransmitter\/neuroreceptor systems.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        14. Novel approaches to visualizing data obtained in
neuroimaging, such as the computational \u201cunfolding\u201d of
three-dimensional images of cerebral\n        cortex.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        15. Improved methods for pediatric brain imaging. These
would include: software and database products, equipment for creating a
\u201cchild-friendly\u201d\n        environment and for the behavioral
training of children and impaired subjects for cooperation and motion
reduction during neuroimaging procedures.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
   16. Combining of different imaging technologies (e.g., ERPs and fMRI;
 MEG and fMRI; MEG and EEG, optogenetic methods and fMRI, etc.). The
latter\n        example, optfMRI, can be used as means of improving
tools for further understanding of neural bases of fMRI signals and to
produce connectivity a map\n        of neural cells that can be defined
both genetically and topographically with a combination of these two
techniques.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        17. New tools and devices
to simultaneously record hemodynamic signals (BOLD, rCBF, etc.) and
neural activity (EEG, LFP, spiking, etc.) to better\n        understand
the direct relationship between blood flow variables and neural activity
 within the brain.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        18. Development of
equipment, software and other tools for recording and quantifying eye
movements, motion, and autonomic reactivity during scanning,\n
applicable to all ages (including young children) particularly in the
MRI environment.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        19. Methods for
relating changes in brain morphology and metabolism associated with age,
 particularly infancy through adolescence, to changes in\n
hemodynamic responses to neural activity and fMRI signals.\n    \n    \n
    \n    \n        20. Improvements in TMS techniques that will allow
for greater specificity in the sites of stimulation and greater control
over the effects of the\n        stimulation. In particular,
improvements in stimulators that would allow much smaller effective
fields of stimulation with more reliable and repeatable\n
stimulator placement would be a significant benefit to the field.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        21. Real time fMRI is becoming a research
tool of interest with potential clinical\/therapeutic neurofeedback
applications. Products are needed that\n        would enhance the
ability of scientists to use this technology for those neurofeedback
applications in an off-the-shelf manner.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  22. Development of methods to improve efficiency, specificity and
controllability of viruses used in primate tract tracing studies.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        23. Development of more sophisticated
imaging strategies in rodents.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        24.
Development of a user-friendly interface to serial reconstruction
software capable of generating stackable, 3D images of axonal and
dendritic\n        arborizations at the light and electron microscopic
level.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        D.    Microscopic Neuroimaging.
The morphology of individual neurons and the distribution of subcellular
 components within them, are key to\n        understanding the manner in
 which these cells function. Advances in the development of agents
indicating neuronal structure and function that can be\n
visualized microscopically are important to the NIMH's interest in brain
 research. This includes enhancements of current agents and ligands to
be\n        imaged (agents indicating specific biochemical processes or
structures, etc.); development of novel agents and ligands; software to
assist interaction\n        with the data; and other related
technologies and methods. Examples would include, but not be limited
to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Software and hardware for
analyzing image data obtained by microscopes, including tools to
automatically or semi-automatically. Identify\n        particular
profiles (e.g., labeled cell bodies), segment images, reconstruct images
 into three dimensional representations, perform unbiased counting\n
    and measuring, etc.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Synthesis
and testing of novel or improved probes for microimaging the nervous
system.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        E.    Molecular and Cellular
Neurobiology and Neurochemistry. Manipulating and studying basic
molecular, cellular and chemical processes has led to\n        insight
to understanding brain function, and has provided the foundation on
which pharmacological interventions have been developed for the
treatment\n        of mental illness. NIMH is interested in supporting a
 wide range of new techniques and tools related to this area. These
include, but are not limited\n        to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
   1.   New low-cost techniques for hybridoma production of monoclonal
antibodies specific for \u201cneural antigens\u201d (e.g.,
neurotransmitters, small peptides,\n        neurotransmitter
receptors).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Innovative methods for
 establishing a \u201cmonoclonal bank\u201d (frozen cells) for each of
the cell lines as a permanent, widely available, reliable, and\n
low cost source of monoclonal antibodies for research on the nervous

 the above receptors linked to some metabolic function and\/or second

\n    \n        8.   Develop cell culture models for neurons, including
methods of purifying homogeneous populations of non-transformed cells
by, for example,\n        developing markers to identify neuronal cell
types for use in characterizing cell-type-specific signaling pathways
which may be useful in tracking the\n        effects of various drugs.\n
    \n    \n    \n    \n        9.   Develop techniques for either
activating or deactivating specific ion channels, receptors and signal

(combining optical and genetic techniques to probe neural circuits
within intact animals).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        F.    Genetic

interested in these areas; some examples of topics relevant to the
mission of this Institute\n        include, but are not limited to:\n

date, including information such as the origin of the transgenic animal,
 key\n        features of the biological and behavioral mutant,

Research on the interplay between the brain, neuroendocrine system, and,
 immune system has revealed important links between\n        these major
 homeostatic system components. Examples of NIMH-relevant topics in this
 area include, but are not limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
1.   Development of new tools to explore the specific properties of the
blood-brain barrier responsible for the selective delivery or retention
of\n        cytokines, immune cells, and drugs affecting immune activity
 in the brain.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Development of

neuroimaging agents.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        H.
Pharmacology. Pharmacological intervention represents a major force in
the treatment of mental illness, and NIMH is interested in supporting\n
       research and development in this area. However, pharmacologic
agents that primarily act on molecular targets which replicate those
of\n        currently-marketed pharmaceuticals used in the treatment of
mental disorders would not be of interest for this program. Relevant
pharmacology topics\n        include, but are not limited to:\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n        1.   New chemical entities with high, selective
affinities for CNS targets. Examples include, but are not limited to,
receptors, transporters, ion\n        channels, enzymes, kinases, or
second or third messenger systems.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.

mixtures of crude extracts from natural products) for possible
therapeutic\n        usefulness using \u201cin vitro\u201d and \u201cin
vivo\u201d assays and model systems.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.
   Methods for extraction, fractionalization, and isolation of active
compounds from natural products. Water-soluble compounds are of
particular\n        interest due to the difficulty of the procedures.\n
   \n    \n    \n    \n        4.   Computer algorithms that model
receptors to evaluate theoretical permutations of known molecules to
find the molecule with the maximum probability\n        of having the
highest affinity for a specific receptor as well as those that have the
potential for the most desirable \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d
rates.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.   Computer models of the
blood brain barrier and evaluate potential and actual drug molecules for
 their ability to cross or penetrate this barrier.\n    \n    \n    \n
  \n        6.   Strategies for evaluating pharmacological agents (e.g.,
 animal behavioral testing, computer simulation) within specific domains
 of cognitive\n        function.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        7.
Behavioral \u201cmodels\u201d similar in animals and humans; behavioral

in humans.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        8.   Development of models
for evaluating drug effects within functional brain circuits relevant to
 mental disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        9.   Development of
novel drug delivery systems.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        10. Tools

compounds) and development of animal models.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
      11. Pharmacological profiling (in vitro and in vivo) for potential
 therapeutic drugs.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        12. Methods for
evaluation of long-term effects of psychotropic drug administration in
animal models or human subjects. If clinical populations are\n
being tested, the technology would be appropriate for either the
Division of Developmental Translational Research (DDTR) or the Division
of Adult\n        Translation Research (DATR) at NIMH.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        13. Improving existing, and developing new, vectors for
delivery of genes to the brain.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        14.

through effects on promoter activity or epigenetic mechanisms.\n    \n
  \n    \n    \n        15. Development of novel high throughput
screening (HTS) assays for drug development. Examples include, but are
not limited to, in vitro functional\n        assays, toxicology screens,
 blood-brain barrier permeability assays, and circuit based or
behavioral assays.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        16. Development of
novel molecular targets for drug development to treat mental
illnesses.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        I.     Tract Tracing Methods
 and Tools. Little is known about the details of the connectivity of the
 human nervous system, because the best tract\n        tracing
techniques are invasive and require the deposit of substances in vivo.
Methods that would be applicable to post-mortem tissue would allow\n
    significant progress in connectional studies of human tissue, as
well as non-human tissue, particularly with regard to the development of
 c, quantu\n        onnections and the connections of structures not
easily accessed in vivo. Examples include the development of improved
physical, chemical and\/or\n        biological markers for
neuroanatomical tract-tracing (e.g. m dots, caged molecules, viral
delivery agents, etc.).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        J.
Educational Tools. Neuroscience, basic behavioral science and human
genetics are compelling areas of science that not only touch upon a\n
     diverse array of disciplines, but also provide insights to the
essence of what it is to be human. Products aimed at teaching the
substance of these\n        fields to students of all ages would be
useful in disseminating this information and these insights. Examples
include, but are not limited to: software\n        and other interactive
 media used to convey fundamental concepts about the brain to children;
computer simulations of neuroscience experiments;\n        updateable
media that presents state-of-the-art information on particular topics
for use by experts; website or other online, interactive electronic\n
     vehicle to allow for sharing of information about the brain and its
 functions, including technologies for holding interactive research
conferences\n        related to basic behavioral sciences, basic
neuroscience, or clinical neuroscience.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
 K.    Neuroinformatics. Data generated by brain research are diverse,
vast, and complex. The diversity of data is due to the fact that
neuroscience\n        data are obtained from: theoretical, experimental
and clinical approaches; from levels of biological organization that
span molecules to populations of\n        individuals and from
single-cell organisms to humans; and from states of health, disease, and
 models of disease. The quantity of data in brain research\n        is
the result of tens of thousands of neuroscience laboratories working
around the world. The complexity of data reflects the high level of\n
     interconnectedness of the data, and their high dimensionality.
Neuroinformatics is a new area of science that draws upon neuroscience,
information\n        science, computer science, statistics, applied
mathematics, and a variety of engineering fields to develop tools that
will let neuroscientists make\n        better sense and use of their
data. These tools include software and hardware for digital data
acquisition, visualization, analysis, integration, and\n        sharing
(e.g., through tools for electronic scientific collaboration). Such
tools can address data of any type or from any area of neuroscience;\n
      examples include, but are not limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        1.   Databases, querying approaches, and information retrieval
 tools for neuroscience and neuroscience-related data. An example would
be the\n        development of a web-based database for sharing,
analyzing and comparing the pharmacological responses of a variety of
CNS active compounds in\n        preclinical studies relevant to mental
health.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Tools for neuroscience
data visualization (and other forms of presentation) and manipulation
(probabilistic atlases of brain structure or\n        function, new
statistical approaches for analyzing data, etc.).\n    \n    \n    \n
 \n        3.   Software for integration and synthesis of neuroscience
data (computational models of neurons to integrate data about structure
and function,\n        environments to merge data from multiple imaging
modalities, etc.).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        4.   Tools for
electronic collaboration to allow neuroscientists to interact with
colleagues, data, and instruments at a distance (this could include\n
     novel types of \u201cgroupware\u201d, etc.).\n    \n    \n    \n
 \n        5.   Tools that bridge existing neuroscience and biology
information tools and resources, such as databases and informatics tools
 associated with\n        genome mapping efforts.\n    \n    \n    \n

Research",
        "description": "\n    \n    \n    \n        The Division of
Developmental Translational Research directs, plans, and supports
programs of research and research training leading to the prevention\n
      and cure of childhood psychopathology. This long-term goal will be
 accomplished through an integrated program of research across\n
behavioral\/psychological processes, brain development, environment and
genetics. The topics listed below reflect the NIMH interest in
technologies\n        related to this research area, but should not be
considered a complete list. Prospective applicants are strongly
encouraged to contact Dr. Margaret\n        Grabb (listed below) with
questions about the relevance of their interests to the mission of this
division.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        A.    Technologies for
Clinical Pediatric Research. It is important to develop reliable methods
 that can correctly identify the normal and abnormal\n        components
 of cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial behavior, as well as normal
and abnormal physiological and biochemical functions, in human\n
development. Computer-based methods of accomplishing this are also
needed to increase the accessibility and reliability of information made
 available\n        to the research community. Examples include:\n    \n
    \n    \n    \n1.          Measurements of Alterations in Pediatric
Development in Patients with Mental Health Disorders Using Physiological
 and Behavioral Measures. \n        Research studies indicate that some
mental health disorders, such as autism, may begin to develop as early
as infancy. Therefore non-invasive modern\n        equipment that use
the most recent technological advances are needed to isolate specific
physiological and behavioral changes during development, to\n
identify potential diagnostic markers of mental health disorders. A
priority for this program is to support research and development of
hardware and\n        software tools to measure pediatric development.
Examples of technologies needed include:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  a.   Psychophysiological measures to evaluate infants, children or
adolescents.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        b.   Miniaturized
non-invasive instruments to record psychophysiological data (e.g., heart
 and respiration rate, galvanic skin response, and defensive\n
motor behavior).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        c.   Telemetry
capability for non-invasive devices so that children can be monitored
for prolonged periods without interfering with their behavior.\n    \n
  \n    \n    \n        d.   Computer programs and inexpensive computers
 that will collect, analyze and identify recurring patterns in the
psychophysiological measure(s) of\n        interest.\n    \n    \n    \n
    \n        2.   Pediatric Assessment Tool.  Diagnosis of mental
health disorders in children and adolescents is vital to providing
early\n        interventions to treat the disorder. In addition, a
better understanding of the concept of functioning in psychopathology,
and its appropriate\n        measurement, is needed in pediatric
populations. In the future, diagnostic tools may even help detect the
initial onset of illness in children at risk,\n        before symptoms
occur. A priority for this program is to develop novel diagnostic tools
to detect mental health disorders in children and adolescents.\n
Of particular interest to this division are methods that can be used
with children and adolescents with limited verbal communication (i.e.,
very young\n        or developmentally disabled). Biochemical, genetic,
physiological and psychological tool development is welcomed.\n    \n
 \n    \n    \n        a.   Technologies to assess CNS effects of
psychosocial or pharmacological interventions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
        b.   Development of reliable and stable
biomarkers\/biosignatures that can identify at-risk individuals prior to
 disease onset, biological and\n        behavioral indicators or
predictors of treatment response, measures of disease progression,
measures to identify dose ranges prior to clinical studies,\n
preclinical or clinical efficacy testing, toxicity measures for drug
development, defining patients to enroll in the clinical study,
identifying CNS\n        abnormalities, etc.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
      c.   Assessment tools for pediatric mental health disorders that
are sensitive to developmental change, gender and cultural diversity,
variation in\n        cognitive and behavioral functioning, hearing
and\/or speech impairment, and co-morbid disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n
   \n        d.   Innovative approaches to assessing mental disorders
using new statistical and psychometric techniques such as Item Response
Theory.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        e.   Computerized methodologies
 for assessing various mental disorders suitable for use in primary care
 settings, e.g. they would need to function\n        rapidly and
reliably.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        f.    Biological and
behavioral measures to define and assess specific impairment-related
components of psychiatric disorders, e.g., cognitive\n
dysfunctions in schizophrenia.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        g.
Development of valid and reliable measures that operationalize
functioning within and across developmental periods, and that can be
used in a\n        variety of service settings. Such measures can lead
to more accurate diagnoses, a better understanding of the impact of
psychiatric disorders, and\n        better tracking of treatment
effectiveness.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   Behavior Monitoring
 and Analysis of Pediatric Mental Health Disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n
   \n        a.   Improve or create new video devices to monitor human
behavior and ease analysis of behavior.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
 b.   Computer software to ease analysis of behavior monitored by video
or telemetry systems.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        c.   Automated
methods to detect specific emotional states using behavioral and
autonomic indicators: This Division is specifically interested in\n
   technologies that can identify children with heightened or dampened
emotional states that could be associated with particular mental health
disorders,\n        including children with limited verbal skills (i.e.,
 very young or developmentally disabled). If the technology will
primarily be used to investigate\n        basic mechanisms of behavior,
the Division of Neuroscience and Basic Behavioral Science at NIMH would
be the most appropriate division to contact.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
      4.   Intervention Development for Childhood-Onset Mental
Disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        a.   Strategies (e.g.,
animal behavioral testing, computer simulation) for evaluating, in early
 developmental periods, the effects of pharmacological\n        agents
on specific functional domains and brain circuits associated with mental
 disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        b.   Strategies (e.g.,
animal behavioral testing, computer simulation) for evaluating, in early
 developmental periods, the effects of cognitive or\n        behavioral
interventions (e.g., cognitive rehabilitation, attention training) or
device-based protocols (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation or\n
    direct current stimulation) on specific functional domains and brain
 circuits associated with mental disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
     c.   Methods for evaluation of long-term effects of
psychotherapeutic drug administration or brain stimulation protocols in
developmental animal\n        models.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
5.   Methodological Research and Development. There is a need to devise
new ways of data collection, analysis, management and dissemination.\n
      Examples include:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        a.
Technologies that use the most recent technological advances to identify
 aberrations in the CNS during development, associated with mental\n
    disorders. Once these aberrations are identified and localized,
rational therapies can be developed and evaluated.\n    \n    \n    \n
  \n        b.   Innovative, computer-based methods to monitor
preventive and treatment intervention efforts and correlate them with
outcome measures are needed.\n        Results should be accessible to
other interested parties without compromising the privacy of the
individual.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        c.   Development of
innovative software for addressing the integration of distributed
cross-disciplinary data sources into coherent knowledge bases.\n
The data should focus on pediatric mental health disorders.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        d.   Computer-based intervention development for
parents or for school settings.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        e.
Development of databases containing detailed genetic and behavioral
information on pediatric populations and their families, as resources
for the\n        field in investigations of gene x environment
interactions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        f.    Mathematical,
statistical and computer algorithms that could be used to analyze large
and\/or complex data sets. Examples of these data sets\n        include
those derived from functional imaging studies. Among other applications,
 these could be used to segment images such as those obtained from\n
    magnetic resonance imagers, filter noise, visualize data or search
vast data sets for specified patterns or data (e.g., use of pattern
recognition\n        algorithms to search time series data sets obtained
 from electrophysiological recording of neural activity, or video data
obtained from behavioral\n        analysis of genetically altered
animals). Improved techniques for path analysis when examining
functional imaging datasets would also be of interest.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        B.    Child and Adolescent Treatment and Preventive
Intervention Research.  An estimated one in ten children and adolescents
 in the United States\n        suffers from mental illness severe enough
 to cause some level of impairment. Yet, it remains unclear what
treatments are the best and safest for these\n        developing age
groups. A priority for this program is to support research and
development of novel psychopharmacological or psychosocial approaches
for\n        the treatment and prevention of mental illness in childhood
 and adolescence, in subjects aged 18 and below.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n               The goal of this research is broad and inclusive with
respect to the heterogeneity of patients, the severity and chronicity of
 disorders, and\n        the range of outcomes measured. Disorders
studied include all mental and behavioral disorders. Interventions
studied include pharmacologic approaches\n        (individual and
combination medications), somatic approaches, behavioral and
psychotherapeutic approaches. Research is supported on individual and\n
       combined approaches. Research that translates findings on basic
physiological or behavioral processes into novel preventive or treatment
 interventions\n        is especially encouraged. Effectiveness studies
that focus on interventions of known efficacy are assigned to the
Division of Services and Intervention\n        Research.\n    \n    \n
  \n    \n               Human subjects include child and adolescent age
 groups covering the full range of mental disorders individually and in
complex patterns of\n        comorbidity with other mental disorders and
 behavioral problems (e.g., anxiety and depression) and substance abuse
(e.g., depression and alcohol\n        abuse).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
        1.   Pharmacologic Treatment Intervention. Clinical testing of
novel mechanism therapeutics is the principle aim of this technology\n
      development section. This includes Phase IIa and proof of concept
studies in pediatric subjects. It is expected the pharmacologic agents
selected for\n        these studies be IND-ready and based on novel
molecular targets identified through basic and clinical research,
preclinical research and animal model\n        research relevant to
understanding developmental aspects of mental illness.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        2.   Combined Intervention. Areas include all research
that combines different treatment modalities in a single combined or\n
      comparative protocol (e.g., pharmacologic plus psychosocial
intervention).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   Psychosocial
Intervention. Areas include development and application of new
psychotherapeutic, behavioral, and psychosocial\n        treatments,
based on the latest advances in development neuroscience.\n    \n    \n
   \n    \n        4.   Preventive Intervention Program. Areas include
preventive intervention studies in which efficacy has not been
demonstrated,\n        including those designed to reduce the risk of
onset or delay onset of mental disorders, dysfunctions and related
problems within asymptomatic and\n        subclinical populations and
those related to treatment (e.g., prevention of relapse, recurrence) or
side effects (prevention\/ minimization of tardive\n        dyskinesia,
etc.). Prevention studies that focus on behavioral problems, without a
focus on a specific mental health disorder or a specific domain of\n
    function that significantly impacts a mental health disorder (e.g.
cognitive function) should contact NICHD.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
   5.   Development and Maintenance of Clinical Trial Networks. Areas
include the development of hardware\/software to facilitate research\n
      collaborations in conducting clinical trials, technologies to
facilitate data sharing, merging of multiple data sets, and the
development and\n        maintenance of common protocols across research
 sites working on a common pediatric preventive or treatment
intervention.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        C.    Science Education
in Mental Disorders.  There is a critical need for improvement in
science education, particularly in areas specifically related\n
to brain, behavior and mental illness. Examples include:\n    \n    \n
  \n    \n        1.   Research on the best ways to present neuroscience
 and behavioral science information, in the context of mental health
disorders, to particular\n        groups of students (e.g., kindergarten
 through sixth grade).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.
Computer-based systems to teach students how to observe scientific
phenomena related to the brain, behavior and mental illness, and to
report them\n        clearly in writing.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  3.   Research on better ways to communicate new knowledge and
directions of scientific growth in the area of neuroscience and mental
illness to\n        teachers and curriculum developers.\n    \n    \n

        "topic_name": "Division of Adult Translational Research and
Treatment Development (DATR)",
        "description": "\n    \n    \n    \n        The DATR is
responsible for planning, directing and supporting programs of research,
 research training, research dissemination and resource development\n
     aimed at understanding the pathophysiology of mental illness and
hastening the translation of behavioral science and neuroscience
advances into\n        innovations in clinical care. The Division
supports a broad portfolio of pre-clinical and human clinical studies
that focus on the phenotypic\n        characterization and risk factors
for major psychiatric disorders. In addition , the Division studies
psychiatric disorders of late life. The division\n        is comprised
of four branches. These branches are: The Adult Psychopathology and
Psychosocial Intervention Research Branch, The Clinical Neuroscience\n
      Research Branch, the Geriatrics Research Branch and the
Experimental Therapeutics Branch. This division also includes a program
on Traumatic Stress\n        Disorders Research. Their respective
functions are as follows:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Adult
Psychopathology and Psychosocial Intervention Research Branch. This
branch promotes the integration of basic behavioral and neuroscience
findings\n        into translational research on the foundations of
psychopathology and functional disability. The branch targets new
science based assessment,\n        prevention, treatment and
rehabilitation practices including research on causal risk and
protective factors for mental disorders, mechanisms that\n
convert vulnerability into psychiatric symptoms and disability and use
of modern psychometric and statistical theories to advance nosology
and\n        assessment. Other specific areas of emphasis include mood,
eating disorders, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        Clinical Neuroscience Branch. The focus of this branch
is on the understanding of the neural basis of mental disorders. Human
and animal studies are\n        supported on the molecular, cellular and
 systems level of brain function designed to elucidate the
pathophysiology of mental disease and to translate\n        these
findings to clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention. These
approaches are applied to the spectrum of mental disorders including\n
      schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder and
other brain disorders. Areas of emphasis include: identification of
valid and unique\n        neurophysiological markers or complexes of
markers for the major mental disorders and development of animal and or
computational models that accurately\n        mimic complex
neurophysiology or behaviors characteristic of mental illness.\n    \n
  \n    \n    \n        Geriatrics Research Branch. This branch focuses
on research and resource development in the etiology, pathophysiology
and course of mental disorders of\n        late life as well as in the
treatment and rehabilitation of persons with these disorders. Disorders
studied include mood, anxiety and personality\n        disorders,
psychotic disorders and schizophrenia, psychiatric syndromes and
behavioral disorders in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and related dementias,
suicide,\n        and eating disorders. Selected areas of emphasis
include: development of more reliable and valid phenotypes, assessments
and biological and behavioral\n        markers for late-life mental
disorders; development of improved treatment and preventive intervention
 techniques for use in geriatric care settings;\n        and
identification of genetic, brain imaging and other predictors of
variability in older adults\u2019 treatment response.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        Experimental Therapeutics Branch. This branch supports
multidisciplinary research on novel pharmacological approaches to the
treatment of mental\n        disorders, evaluation of existing
treatments of mental disorders, development and assessment of putative
biomarkers of psychiatric disease and\n        treatment response and
development and testing of novel treatments. Studies supported include
early phase clinical studies of new medications, studies\n        to
predict treatment response and studies to validate biomarkers or
predictors of therapeutic response to pharmacological intervention. Side
 effects of\n        therapeutic agents are also given emphasis.\n    \n
    \n    \n    \n        Traumatic Stress Disorders Research Program.
This program supports integrating basic behavioral and neuroscience
findings into translational research\n        on psychopathology
associated with trauma exposure. Areas of emphasis include developing
disorder and risk assessment tools based on individual\n
differences, the development of treatment and preventive interventions
for posttraumatic disorders, and identifying mechanisms of therapies
and\n        mechanisms of disorder that are impacted by therapies. This
 program also supports a broader continuum of research (basic science,
clinical practice,\n        and health care system factors) focused on
the mental health consequences of mass trauma and violence (e.g. war,
terrorism, natural and technological\n        disaster), including
interventions and service delivery in children, adolescents, and adults
impacted by mass trauma.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        All
applications relevant to the mission of the Division of Adult
translational Research and Treatment Development will receive full
consideration.\n        Possible areas for future research include:\n
 \n    \n    \n    \n        A.    Instrumentation for Clinical
Research. Up-to-date hardware\/software systems that use the most recent
 technological advances are needed to\n        identify CNS
dysfunction(s) related to mental disease. Once these dysfunctions are
identified and localized, rational therapies can be developed and\n
   evaluated.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Physiological and
Behavioral Monitoring: Technologies are needed to continuously
monitoring physiological data (e.g., temperature,\n        activity,
sleep duration, EEG activity, ECG, pulse rate) with behavior,
noninvasively and without impacting behavior. These monitoring devices
should\n        be designed for use with subjects that have a mental
illness.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Data Analysis from
Complex Data Sets: Computational tools are needed to record, catalog,
categorize and identify interrelationships\n        between several of
the above measures.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   Deep Brain
Stimulation Technologies: Improvements in deep brain stimulation
technology in human subjects\/patients is increasingly\n
important as this technique becomes more common as a potential treatment
 option for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, depression, and other
disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        B.    Technologies for Adult
 Clinical Research. It is important to develop reliable methods that can
 correctly identify the normal and abnormal\n        components of
cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial behavior in human development.
Computer-based methods of accomplishing this aim are needed to\n
increase the accessibility and reliability of information made available
 to the research community.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.

medication regimens.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        e.   Innovative
technologies for identifying and directing clinical attention to
potentially adverse psychotropic drug interactions, particularly in\n
     vulnerable patients with complex regimens involving multiple
medications.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        f.    Simple-to-use tools
for assessing individual risk profiles for the development of various
mental disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Methodological

collection, analysis, management and dissemination.\n    \n    \n    \n
   \n        a.   New relatively culture-free taxonomies and\/or
measures of basic behavioral and social phenomena that can be employed
in research across\n        socio-cultural contexts.\n    \n    \n    \n
    \n        b.   Innovative computer-based observation techniques, and
 computer software and hardware that allow on-line methods for
characterization of\n        interpersonal interactions in groups.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        c.   Low cost microcomputer software for the
 recording and analysis of patterns and sequences in observed social
interactions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        d.   Causal modeling
methodology as applied to correlational longitudinal data sets.\n    \n
   \n    \n    \n        e.   A data translation and communication
package for collecting, archiving, and making available existing
longitudinal behavioral sets to the\n        scientific community for
secondary or meta-analyses.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        f.
Flexible user-friendly software for control of timed, multi-modal
stimulus presentation and response collection for experiments on
perception and\n        cognition.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        g.

 of novel methods to enhance efficiency of early phase clinical
trials.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Development of novel
assessments of psychopathology suitable for use in clinical research.\n
   \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   Identification of causal risk and
protective factors for mental disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  4.   Development of standardized assessments of psychiatric and
comorbid disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        5.   Develop
psychometrically sound methods for assessing the cognitive, affective
and behavioral response systems believed to underpin clinical\n
symptoms and functional impairments.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        6.
   Identify valid markers of illness onset.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
     7.   Develop new definitions and measures to assess functioning in
people with psychiatric disorders including self-reports, tests that

\n    \n        10. Identify valid and unique neuropsychological markers
 for the major mental and personality disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        11. Identify more reliable and valid phenotypes, assessments
and behavioral markers for late-life mental disorders.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        12. Development of techniques for maintaining or
restoring mental capacities in older adults who experience declining
learning and memory abilities due\n        to age-related brain
disorders.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        D.    Experimental
Therapeutics Research.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        1.   Early phase

Services and Interventions Research supports research, research
demonstrations, research training, resource development, and research\n
       dissemination in prevention and treatment interventions, services
 research, clinical epidemiology, and diagnostic and disability
assessment. The\n        division is composed of three branches:
Services Research and Clinical Epidemiology Branch, Adult Treatment and
Preventive Intervention Research\n        Branch, and Child and
Adolescent Treatment and Preventive Intervention Research Branch.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        The Division supports two critical areas of
research:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \u00b7        Intervention
research to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacologic, psychosocial
(psychotherapeutic and behavioral), somatic, rehabilitative\n        and
 combination interventions on mental and behavior disorders-including
acute and longer-term therapeutic effects on functioning across domains
(such\n        as school, family, peer functioning) for children,
adolescents and adults.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n
Mental health services research\n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n
   The interventions focus is broad and inclusive with respect to the
heterogeneity of patients, the severity and chronicity of disorders, and
 the variety\n        of community and institutional settings in which
treatment is provided. It includes clinical trials evaluating the
effectiveness of known efficacious\n        interventions, as well as
studies evaluating modified or adapted forms of interventions for use
with additional populations (such as women, ethnic and\n        racial
groups), new settings (public sector, pediatric primary care, schools,
other non-academic settings, communities at large) and people with\n
    co-occurring disorders. Other foci include: identifying subgroups
who may be more likely to benefit from treatment, evaluating the
combined or\n        sequential use of interventions (such as to extend
effect among refractory subgroups), determining the optimal length of
intervention, establishing the\n        utility of continuation or
maintenance treatment (that is, for prevention of relapse or
recurrence), and evaluating the long-term impact of efficacious\n
 interventions on symptoms and functioning.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
     Services research covers all mental health services research
issues, across the lifespan and disorders, including, but not limited
to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \u00b7        Services
organization, delivery (process and receipt of care), and related health
 economics at the individual, clinical, program, community\n        and

and\n        Clinical Epidemiology Research,\u201d and the NIMH
Strategic Plan. Examples are listed below:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
    1.   Clinical Trials Methodologies: The development, testing and
refinement of methodologies, instruments and statistical approaches\n
     to facilitate collaborative clinical trials for the prevention,
treatment and rehabilitation of individuals with mental disorders; the
development of\n        innovative trials design (e.g., fixed adaptive,
encouragement, partially randomized preference) the application of
modern technology to enhance the\n        science, operation, and
management of multi-site mental health clinical trials; and the
development of mental health clinical trial archives. The\n
development of portable clinical trial management systems such as
serious adverse event (SAE) oversight and monitoring software.

mental health disorders. Development of common data elements to enhance
uniformity across clinical trials with\n        and amongst disorders.\n
    \n    \n    \n    \n        2.   Science Training and Education:
SBIR applications must focus on DSIR\u2019s research priorities.
Develop, modify and test new and\n        existing technologies,
strategies and approaches to: (1) enhance science and research training
across the educational\/ career pipeline; (2) improve\n
scientific literacy for clinicians and service\/ organizational
providers; (3) encourage entry and retention of individuals with
non-mental health\n        science backgrounds (engineers, computer
scientists, medical anthropologists, law, business) or perspectives
(individuals from under-represented\n        communities) into the
mental health services and interventions field; (4) keep established
researchers and practitioners up-to-date on the findings,\n
implementation, and methods of services and interventions research; and
(5) facilitate participatory research with individuals, families and\n
      communities. This can include the development of science\/
research education materials, curriculum, methodologies and web-based
programs relevant to\n        the mission of the division; the
development of networking and collaborative approaches to research
training in mental health interventions and\n        services research;
and the development of multi-media approaches (combined with traditional
 strategies) to improve the level of scientific and career\n
mentoring that mental health services and interventions researchers
receive.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.   Public Health Oriented
Pharmacoeconomics: Develop and test simulation models for estimating the
 amount of total out-of-pocket\n        expenditures (co-payments) for
the most frequently prescribed psychotropic drugs under different
insurance benefit scenarios and\/or under different\n        pharmacy
benefit management scenarios. Models should also be developed to
accommodate common combined pharmaceutical approaches.\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        4.   Dissemination: Development of technological
approaches to increase the sustainable uptake of scientifically based
treatments and\n        services across diverse community settings. This
 could include web-based interactive tools for state\/county mental
health or related (e.g., schools)\n        agencies around
implementation of evidence-based practices. Development of innovative
ways (e.g., new technology, use of multi-media) of disseminating\n
  information to stakeholders. Development of new approaches to the
dissemination and implementation of evidence based mental health
interventions to\n        underserved populations (e.g.,
rural\/frontier, aging individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders).

 and the dissemination of their results.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  5.   Implementation: Application of new technologies, approaches and
strategies to identify and utilize active therapeutic ingredients\n
   in complex community-based services and programs that optimize
functioning and sustain community reintegration of people with mental
disorders. Use of\n        technologies and strategies to assist service
 systems to more adequately plan for transitions (e.g., child to adult
system, prison to community) and\n        seamlessly integrate mentally
ill individuals moving between these sectors.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
       6.   Merging Multiple Data Sets: Merging multiple data sets
(e.g., claims, trials, pharmacy etc.) for innovative and complex
analytic\n        strategies.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        7.
Community Outreach to Diverse and Underserved Populations: Application
of new technologies and strategies to develop, test, and\n        refine
 culturally appropriate materials and approaches to: foster help-seeking
 and engagement of diverse and underserved populations in
research-based\n        mental health treatment and prevention; to
foster participation in community based research by diverse and
underserved populations; and to inform\n        diverse provider groups
about state-of-the-art mental health treatments and services in order to
 facilitate their implementation of these\n        interventions.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        8.   Computerized Methodologies for Mental
Health Services Research: Applications need to focus on computerized
methods to assess\n        mental disorders in primary care settings
including screening devices for identifying mental disorders across the
life-span; development of computer\n        software and hardware that
allow conducting computer assisted interviews with severely mentally ill
 people for research purposes to obtain information\n        on their
quality of care; design work to move assessment as rapidly as possible
to computerized adaptive testing (CAT); apply audio and video\n
technologies to assess patient\u2019s treatment preferences.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        A.    Services Research and Clinical Epidemiology
Branch. The branch supports research on the organization, financing,
delivery, effectiveness, and\n        appropriateness of mental health
care in everyday settings in order to find ways to improve the
effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of mental health\n        services
 (including preventive services) in community and other settings. Also
supported are studies on pharmacoeconomics, pharmaco-epidemiology, and\n
        the distribution, determinants, and course of mental illness in
the context of various clinical settings. Mental health services include
 mental health\n        care provided in specialty mental health and
general health care settings, including primary care, hospitals, nursing
 homes, and other residential care\n        settings, as well as in
educational settings and various legal system settings, such as jails,
juvenile detention and correctional facilities, prisons,\n        and
probation and parole programs. Other services often needed by mentally
ill persons include social services, vocational and rehabilitation
services,\n        welfare, and housing. Relevant services include those
 provided to children and adolescents with emotional disorders, adults
and elderly adults with\n        mental disorders, and persons with
mental illness that co-occurs with physical illness and with alcohol
and\/or drug abuse disorder. Research\n        methodologies include
ethnographic studies, surveys, and analyses of secondary data,
randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental designs, cohort,\n
   and case-control studies.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
Advances in clinical epidemiology, mental health treatment and services
research fields have made it imperative that intensive work continue
in\n        the areas of assessment\/screening technologies, outcome
assessment measurement and measurement packages, dissemination
technologies, data analysis\n        techniques, and the training of
clinicians and providers. The translation of efficacious and effective
treatments into primary care, community mental\n        health centers,
and managed care settings is both a major challenge and opportunity to
develop technologies and systems that will improve the care and\n
 rehabilitation of patients and enable them to profit from the research
advances that have been made. Research is needed on the dissemination
of\n        empirically supported treatments or services.\n    \n    \n
   \n    \n        1.   Methodological Research Program. Supports
studies that involve development, testing, and refinement of
methodologies and instruments to\n        facilitate research on

 is to reduce the burden of neurological disease\u2014a burden borne by
every age group, by every segment of society, by people all over\n
  the world. To this end, the Institute supports and conducts research
on the healthy and diseased brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves.
Hundreds of\n        disorders afflict the nervous system. Common
disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and autism
 are well-known. Many other\n        neurological disorders are rare and
 known only to the individuals and families affected, their doctors, and
 scientists.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        The NINDS SBIR\/STTR
program funds small business concerns to conduct innovative neuroscience
 research or neuroscience research and development\n
(R\/R&amp;amp;D) that has both the potential for commercialization and
public benefit. NINDS is committed to helping small business concerns
commercialize\n        their technologies through its grant funding,
technical assistance program participation, and outreach at meetings.
NINDS encourages all Phase II\napplicants to apply to the        NIH
Commercialization Assistance Program (CAP) to gain assistance in\n
  transferring their products to the marketplace. The CAP program is
open to all Phase II grants that were active in the past six years.
NINDS is\n        increasingly tracking the progress of its funded small
 business concerns and the products they develop. Funding priority will
be given to those small\n        business concerns that show not only
their ability to develop products but their growth as a small business
concern towards independence from the\n        SBIR\/STTR program.\n

NINDS is committed to identifying effective treatments for neurological
disorders by supporting well-executed clinical trials. NINDS may
decline\n        funding of a clinical trial application for
programmatic or administrative reasons. SBIR applicants are strongly
encouraged to contact Joanne\nOdenkirchen (contact information provided
below) within the NINDS Office of Clinical Research for advice about
potential clinical trial applications        prior to submission in
order to determine the relevance of the proposed research to NINDS and

Research\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Although translational
research is supported through the general SBIR\/STTR program
announcement, the NINDS also has a Cooperative Program in\n
Translational research (PAR-08-235). The NINDS Cooperative Program
encourages Phase II and Fast-Track applications that directly address
the\n        identification and pre-clinical testing of new therapeutics
 for neurological disorders. The program will facilitate solicitation,
development, and\n        review of therapy-directed projects to
accelerate the translation of basic research discoveries into
therapeutic candidates for clinical testing. This\n        program is
specifically directed at projects that include therapeutic leads with
demonstrated activity against the intended disease target. The program\n
        supports pre-clinical optimization and testing of these leads
and projects must be sufficiently advanced that an IND or IDE
application to the FDA can\n        be submitted by the end of the
project period. The program does not support early-stage therapeutic
discovery activities such as high throughput\n        screening. The
program also excludes clinical research, basic research, and studies of
disease mechanism. This is a milestone-driven cooperative\n
agreement program involving participation of NINDS staff in the
development of the project plan and monitoring of research progress. For

Colorimetric Assay to Measure Cyanopyrethroid Insecticides on Treated
Fabrics and Walls",
        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n
Insecticide-based interventions are used in many vector control programs
 worldwide for managing diseases such as malaria and dengue.\n
Insecticide-impregnated fabrics, (e.g. bed nets, curtains and clothing),
 as well as insecticide spraying onto walls (indoor residual spraying)
have\n        been shown to be effective in reducing vector-borne
disease transmission by providing an insecticidal barrier against
disease-transmitting vectors .\n        Monitoring of insecticide levels
 provides critical information about the quality of vector control
interventions, for formulating strategies and\n        focusing control
efforts. However there is currently no rapid field-deployable assay(s)
to monitor the effectiveness of insecticides used in these\n
control methods. Pyrethroids are commonly used in indoor residual
spraying (IRS) programs and deltamethrin\/ permethrin are the only two
pyrethroids\n        approved for treated fabrics. Gas or
high-performance liquid chromatography provides the most sensitive means
 of pyrethroid analysis. The standard WHO\n        cone bioassays for
evaluating efficacy of insecticides in IRS and for bed nets requires
access to a colony of susceptible mosquitoes. These techniques\n
are neither practical nor affordable (labor\/resource intensive and\/or
require highly trained personnel) in countries where
insecticide-treated\n        materials or IRS are being implemented. A
sensitive quantitative colorimetric assay with an innovative sampling
technique (simple rubbing of filter\n        paper on material surface)
to measure cyanopyrethroid (e.g. deltamethrin, \u03bb-cyhalothrin,
\u03b1-cypermethrin, cyfluthrin, etc.) levels on bed nets has been\n
    developed at the CDC Entomology Branch and has proven to be robust
and sensitive (Trop. Med. &amp;amp; Int. Health Vol 14, pp 1-8, 2009).
The next step is\n        to further develop this technique into
field-usable assay(s) capable of determining and quantifying pyrethroid
levels for monitoring vector-control\n        interventions.\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        Public Health Impact:\n        Insecticides are
still the mainstays of vector-borne disease control. With malaria
elimination back on the global agenda, there has been an expansion\n
    of IRS and a dramatic increase of insecticide-treated bed net
distribution for vector suppression and reducing transmission. Technical
 and operational\n        obstacles for successful vector control
operations include technical quality of IRS, effective life of the
insecticide on sprayed surfaces and levels\n        of pyrethroids in
bed nets. Sub-optimal levels of insecticides also increase the potential
 of insecticide resistance developing in the vectors.\n
Field-usable assays are key to accurately and rapidly monitor
insecticide-based approaches and to prevent resistance to the
insecticide.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Examples of specific
research areas of interest include, but are not limited to:\n
Development of field-usable assay(s) capable of determining and
quantifying pyrethroid levels for monitoring vector-control
interventions. The assay(s)\n        should be easy to operate,
inexpensive, portable, use heat stable reagents and have no special
storage requirement. The focus of current\n        cyanopyrethroid assay
 has been for deltamethrin in treated bed-nets. However another
cyanopyrethroid, \u03b1-cypermethrin, and a non-cyanopyrethroid,\n
  permethrin is also used for bed nets. In addition a number of
pyrethroids are used for IRS. Of particular interest to CDC are assays
capable of\n        detecting pyrethroids currently used on bed-nets,
and pyrethroids detection assays that can be used for monitoring IRS
programs used for different\n        housing materials.\n    \n",

Parasite Detection in the Field and Innovative Tools for the Detection
of Drug Resistant Malaria Parasites in the Field",
        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n        Malaria
continues to be a global public health challenge contributing to at
least an estimated 800,000 deaths and more than 240 million clinical\n
      illnesses affecting mostly young children in Sub-Saharan Africa
and other tropical countries. Development of resistance to cheap
antimalarial drugs\n        such as chloroquine and
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine has led to adoption of artemisinin based
combination therapy (ACT) which is more expensive. Recently\n        the
 World Health Organization has recommended evidence based treatment
(based on confirmed diagnosis of parasites) for malaria instead of
basing\n        treatment on symptoms. However, microscopic diagnosis is
 not feasible in many endemic countries setting and there is a greater
need for alternative\n        diagnostic tools for malaria. Although
immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been used for
malaria diagnosis, these tests have\n        limitations in correctly
identifying malaria species and recently the emergence of parasite
populations lacking the most commonly used diagnostic\n        antigen
HRP-2. In addition, there is a concerted effort through various public
and private efforts (such as U.S. President\u2019s Malaria Initiative,
U.N.\n        Millennium Development Goals, Gates Foundation etc) to
reduce malaria burden to very low levels, including elimination of
malaria wherever possible. As\n        these efforts progress there is
increased realization that there is a need for more sensitive field
diagnostic tools to diagnose low density infections\n        that
contribute to ongoing transmission but which are not detected by RDTs or
 microscopy.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Since 2006, 38 countries
in sub-Saharan Africa and most other endemic countries have adopted an
ACT regimen for the primary treatment of uncomplicated\n        malaria
due to P. falciparum infection. Although it was hoped that ACT would
remain efficacious for a number of years until the next generation\n
    of antimalarials would become available, very recent surveillance
data from the Thailand-Cambodia border have raised the alarming specter
of declining\n        efficacy of ACTs. Initially it was hoped that
resistance was due to declining efficacy for the artemisinin partner
mefloquine. Unfortunately,\n        additional recent research has shown
 that resistance to artemisinin has emerged. In the past molecular
markers have proven to be useful molecular tools\n        for tracking
resistant parasites and there is greater need to adopt simpler field
usable platforms for conducting molecular surveillance for monitoring\n
       emergence and spread of resistant parasites. Currently, there are
 no available molecular markers for artemisinin resistance. In addition,
 available\n        molecular tools are expensive and not available for
use in endemic countries, requiring shipment of samples to developed
countries for analysis.\n        Therefore, there is a need to develop
field usable immunologic, molecular and other tools for malaria
diagnosis and for detecting resistant parasites.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        Public Health Impact:\n        \u00a0 Availability of
diagnostic tests with greater sensitivity can help to identify
subclinical infections, reduce transmission, and monitor success of\n
     control programs. Development of field usable tools for the
surveillance of drug resistant parasites will help to develop
appropriate public health\n        policies to combat resistance.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        Examples of specific research areas of
interest include, but are not limited to:\n        \u00a0 1) Development
 of highly sensitive, specific and field usable tests for malaria
parasite detection for use in malaria control programs for mass\n
 screening. 2) Development of molecular tools that can simultaneously
detect several molecular markers of drug resistant malaria parasites
using simpler\n        platforms that can be used in the field.\n    \n

        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n        Neglected
tropical diseases (NTDs) are bacterial and parasitic infections that
disproportionately affect poor and marginalized populations around the\n
        world. A subset of NTDs, including lymphatic filariasis,
onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, trachoma and intestinal helminth
infections, can be targeted\n        effectively through mass
chemotherapy. These NTDs are not considered to cause appreciable
mortality; however, they are associated with high levels of\n
morbidity because of the chronic nature of many of the infections.
Blindness and disability due to these NTDs increase in prevalence with
age, reducing\n        the productivity of adults. Intestinal helminths,
 among the commonest of infections, have profound effects on the growth
and cognitive development of\n        children. The past five years have
 seen significant increases in the number of countries implementing NTD
programs and in the number of persons being\n        treated. These
increases are the direct result of generous donations of drugs from
pharmaceutical manufacturers and new funding support from USAID and\n
     DFID, among others. Reducing the morbidity caused by NTDs is an
objective of the Global Health Initiative and the global elimination of
lymphatic\n        filariasis and trachoma are specific GHI targets.
Available diagnostic tools for lymphatic filariasis, trachoma,
schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis and\n        intestinal helminth
infections do not at present meet the needs of the control programs.\n
  \n    \n    \n    \n        Public Health Impact:\n        \u00a0
Development of improved diagnostic tools would enhance the commitment of
 donors and policy makers to the control and elimination programs for
NTDs by\n        providing higher quality information and increased
confidence that public health goals are being met. Significant savings
in human and financial\n        resources could be obtained through the
development of improved diagnostic tools.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
   Examples of specific research areas of interest include, but are not
limited to:\n        \u00a0 For diseases addressed by mass drug
administration (MDA), diagnostic tests are needed to guide programmatic
decisions on community treatment. Despite\n        the molecular
revolution in biology, little of the new found knowledge of parasite
genes and gene products is being translated into tools than can be\n
    used in the field to guide program decisions. Tools for mapping and
monitoring program impact are still conventional parasitologic methods,
based on\n        microscopy. These tests lack sensitivity and are not
adequate for NTD programs with elimination endpoints. New antibody tests
 could provide more\n        sensitive tools to monitor transmission,
facilitate decision-making and conduct surveillance. The potential
advantages of antibody-based tests for\n        post-MDA surveillance
argue that increased efforts also should be made to develop a standard
platform for such tests, opening opportunities for\n        integrated
surveillance for NTDs.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        For CGH

the U.S. Coast Guard received reports for 4,789 boating incidents; 3,331
 boaters were reported injured, and 709 died. Among those who drowned,\n
        9 out of 10 were not wearing life jackets (personal floatation
device or PDF). Most boating fatalities that occurred during 2008 (72%)
were caused by\n        drowning with 90% of victims not wearing life
jackets (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Wide-ranging OnLine

\\t "_blank"http:\/\/wonder.cdc.gov\/mortsql.html).\n    \n    \n    \n
   \n        For those who take to the water for occupational purposes,
the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) estimates during 1982-1987 the annual
occupational fatality rate\n        for U.S. commercial fishermen was 47
 deaths per 100,000 workers. The major cause of these deaths was
drowning. According to information gathered by\n        CDC\u2019s
Alaska Activity, the occupational fatality rate for commercial fishermen
 in Alaska during 1991-1993 was 195 deaths per 100,000 workers --
nearly\n        30 times the average annual rate for all U.S. workers.
Of these 195 deaths, 91% were caused by drowning. Data clearly show that
 PFDs greatly increase\n        the chances of survival for fishermen:
63% of fishermen wearing PFDs when they jumped or fell into the water
survived, whereas only 12% of those\n        without PFDs survived.
These conclusions and recommendations may apply to all commercial
fishing operations in the United States.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
  Public Health Impact:\n        Studies have shown that the majority of
 drowning incidents were precipitated by unexpected entry into the
water, which means the victim had no time to\n        grab a life jacket
 before entering the water. Many of the drowning incidents could have
been prevented by wearing a PDF. Common reasons given for not\n
wearing a life jacket include being 1) uncomfortable and 2) expensive. A
 newly designed life jacket that addressed these issued has the
potential to\n        increase use and decrease morbidity and mortality
from drowning. It is believed that a wide array of retail and commercial
 outlets (specialty outdoor\n        retail stores, warehouse stores,
and convenience stores) will have an interest in this product.\n    \n

obesity affects 23 million children in the United States. Seventy
percent of overweight and obese youth become overweight and obese
adults,\n        which significantly increases the risk of hypertension,
 type 2 diabetes, kidney problems, heart disease, and certain types of
cancer (Power, Lake &amp;amp;\n        Cole, 1997; Dietz, 1998). Most
school-based childhood obesity interventions target some aspect of
energy balance\u2014either reducing the calories consumed\n        by
removing soda machines in schools or providing healthy meal choices, or
by increasing physical activity through recess, physical education
classes,\nafter school, or weekend programs. Although physical education
 and recess time will help address the issue, a process to engage in
physical activity        during the entire duration of the school day
may provide additional benefits (see description of winnable battles,

from a pilot study of 71\n        first-graders in five classrooms

effects.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Public Health Impact:\n
 Standing desks for schools children may provide a relatively low-cost,
low-effort method of combating childhood obesity in an institutional
setting in\n        which most American children spend a great deal of
time. Schools and school districts could be encouraged to purchase
standing desks for their\n        classrooms based on increased calorie
burn, increased academic performance, and improved behavior in the
classroom. For example, after learning of the\n        pilot
study\u2019s success in five classrooms, the Edinburg Consolidated
Independent School District in south Texas decided to purchase standing
desks for\n        four new elementary schools and one new middle school
 in the next few years. As new schools are built and older schools are
renovated, districts may\n        consider standing workstations as
better alternatives to traditional classroom furniture.\n    \n    \n

Characteristics of an effective desk include usability, comfort,
likeability for students and teachers, and sustained across a variety
of\n        classroom types. Ideally a well designed standing desk would
 increase students\u2019 caloric burn, decrease body fat percentage and

        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n        The
majority of the U.S. adult population consumes more than 2 times their

strongly\n        increases the risk of having high blood pressure which
 currently affects nearly 1 in 3 adult Americans, the majority of whom
do not have it under\n        control. High blood pressure is a leading
risk factor for heart disease and stroke, the first and third leading
causes of death, as well as kidney\n        disease. The vast majority
of sodium consumed in the United States comes from restaurant and
processed foods. Two scalable strategies to help reduce\n        the

 sodium in restaurant and processed foods and 2) informing the public
about\n        recommended sodium intake levels, the sodium content of

        Improving nutrition by reducing sodium intake is one of
CDC\u2019s Winnable Battles and one that will save lives. Recent
research has advised that reducing\n        sodium levels in packaged
foods and restaurant foods in half would save tens of thousands of lives
 per year from fatal heart attacks and strokes.\n        Reducing
average population intake to the recommended 2300 mg per day may reduce
cases of hypertension by 11 million and save $18 billion health care\n
      dollars.\u00a0\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        The nutritional

industry food and drink establishments in the US that could benefit from
 this tool.\n        High volume food purchasers are key points of
leverage in changing the nation\u2019s food supply. By shifting
purchases to healthier products, these\n        businesses would not
only provide healthier foods to their constituents, but send a powerful
message to wholesalers that consumers demand healthier\n
products.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Examples of specific research
 areas of interest include, but are not limited to:\n        Develop an
accessible nutritional information system for low sodium products to be
used by restaurants and wholesale food purchasers. The system should\n
      include geocoding and a search tool. Elements of developing the
nutritional information system may included identifying the structure
and key variables\n        in the food supply chain in the US,
cataloguing the nutrient content of products available from suppliers,
development of a web-based search tool to\n        enable purchasers to

Point of Care Test for Human Papillomavirus Typing",
        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n        With nearly
 500,000 new cases and 274,000 deaths annually, cervical cancer is the
second most common cancer among women worldwide. The understanding\n
    that persistent infection with one of ~15 high risk (HR) Human
Papillomavirus (HPV) is required for cervical carcinogenesis led to the
successful\n        development of vaccines to prevent HPV infection as
well as to recommendations to incorporate HPV testing into cervical
cancer screening algorithms.\n        Cervical cancer control strategies
 ideally will include a combination of screening and vaccination.
However 80% of the deaths from cervical cancer\n        occur in regions
 of the world with the lowest resources. With Gates Foundation funding,
PATH developed CareHPV, an adaptation of the FDA approved\n
Digene HPV test for use in low resource settings. This has promise for
screening, but does not provide type-specific information needed to
monitor HPV\n        vaccine impact. Due to the long natural history of
cervical cancer, impact of the vaccine on this endpoint will not be seen
 for decades after\n        widespread vaccine uptake. The ability to
detect an impact on an early biologic endpoint is helpful to ensure the
commitment of ministries of health to\n        ongoing expensive HPV
vaccination.\u00a0\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Public Health
Impact:\n        A simple point of care test for HPV typing would
facilitate cervical cancer control in low resource settings by
supporting both vaccination and\n        screening. In developed
countries the test would reduce loss to follow-up by allowing definitive
 treatment decisions to be made at one visit. With\n        increased
recognition of the role of HPV in anal and oropharyngeal cancers, the
test may have impact on cancers at those sites as well. There is an\n
     expanding market for HPV tests. While HPV typing assays are
available, all are highly complex and expensive requiring at least one
day turnaround.\u00a0\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Examples of
specific research areas of interest include, but are not limited to:\n
      Develop a point-of care device for rapid detection and typing of
HR HPV from a variety of biological samples such as cervical, anal and
penile swabs.\n        The device should incorporate simplified methods
for sample handling, and may utilize target and or signal amplification
to identify 14 high risk HPV\n        types (e.g., HPV 16, 18, etc.).
CDC is interested in the application of biosensors, microfluidic
platform, and nanoparticles in the successful\n        development of a
fully integrated system for point of care HPV typing.\u00a0\n    \n",

        "topic_name": "Improving Hospital-Based Antimicrobial Use to
Prevent Antimicrobial Resistant Healthcare-Associated Infections",
        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n
Healthcare-associated infections have been estimated to occur in about
one of every 20 hospitalized persons; an increasing proportion (about
20%) of\n        HAIs are caused by pathogens demonstrating increased
resistance to traditional antimicrobials, leaving clinicians with fewer
treatment choices and\n        putting other patients at risk for
infections through transmission between patients. Over the past decade,
researchers have demonstrated that use of a\n        comparative measure
 of inpatient-antimicrobial use by pharmacists and providers improves
the appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing by providers\n
in hospitals that use these measures. To facilitate this prevention
strategy, CDC\u2019s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)
(HYPERLINK\n
"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nhsn\/index.html"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nhsn\/index.html)
 is launching an Antimicrobial Use Surveillance Option in January, 2011
to allow\n        facilities to report such data and compare
facility-specific usage rates to a national risk-adjusted comparative
benchmark; however, facilities are\n        required to submit these
data electronically using specifications consistent with the NHSN
electronic reporting standards. Complying with these\n        standards
will require vendors of \u201cElectronic Medication Administration
Records\u201d (eMAR) used in acute-care facilities to modify the
applicable software\n        to allow such reporting. After initial
modification and piloting of the reporting from a few facilities to
NHSN, expansion of such reporting as a tool\n        for reducing
antimicrobial-resistant HAIs within acute-care facilities nationally can
 occur. As more vendors enable their products to report these data\n
    electronically to CDC\u2019s NHSN, CDC will be able to provide the
comparative data to drive practice change locally at each reporting
facility and to\n        reduce unnecessary antimicrobial use through
this enhancement of antimicrobial stewardship activities. Research has
suggested that facilities can\n        reduce unnecessary antimicrobial
use through activities such as these within 6 months, and observe
reductions in antimicrobial-resistant infections\n        within 2
years.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Public Health Impact:\n
\u00a0 Successful piloting of submission of data from eMAR systems to
NHSN would provide facilities utilizing the vendor\u2019s software to
report and receive\n        comparative antimicrobial use data as a tool
 to drive local HAI prevention activity. HAIs are reportable in over 22
States, and antimicrobial use\n        stewardship is mandated in
California. Commercialization potential for antimicrobial use reporting
is going to increase as mandates become more\n        common.\u00a0\n
 \n    \n    \n    \n        Examples of specific research areas of
interest include, but are not limited to:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
   1. Develop a technical prototype for aggregating antimicrobial use
metrics (as outlined in NHSN \u2013website) using eMAR systems and
reporting to NHSN\n        within the CDC clinical document architecture
 specifications (HYPERLINK\n
"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nhsn\/CDA_eSurveillance.html"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nhsn\/CDA_eSurveillance.html).\u00a0\n
    \n    \n    \n    \n        2. Evaluate (1) the validity (i.e.,
accuracy) of the data reported to NHSN and (2) the usability by
hospital-based pharmacists.\u00a0\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        3.
Define a scalable solution and business plan to enhance utilization of
the reporting capabilities by all acute-care facilities using

Sharps Injuries",
        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n
The\u00a0needle-syringe\u00a0(N-S), invented 150 years ago, while
invaluable in medicine, also pose several risks, primarily through
intentional or inadvertent\n        unsterile re-use, as well as through
 needlestick injury and improper waste disposal. These pose a
substantial burden in resulting transmission of\n        blood-borne
pathogens (BBPs) in healthcare workers, patients and others exposed to
these sharps.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        The World Health
Organization estimates that unsafe injections result in 260,000 human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 21 million hepatitis B virus\n
(HBV), and 2 million hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and 9.2 million
Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost annually.\u00a0\n    \n
\n    \n    \n        Fundamentally, the N-S is
\u201cover-engineered\u201d for its routine use. For a medical procedure
 that is low pressure and takes a few seconds, one is left with\n
 an almost indestructible stainless steel needle and a durable plastic
syringe. In some developed countries, the solution\u00a0has been to use
sterile,\n        disposable\u00a0N-Ss only once, activate their
needletip-shielding devices, and then\u00a0discard each in a safety
container (and ultimately incinerated). Such\n        safety syringes
are uncommon among diabetics and intravenous drug users (IDUs), however;
 therefore safe disposal of used N-S in these two populations\n
remain an issue.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        In developing
countries, N-S with safety features is usually unavailable due to their
higher cost. Logistical constraints result in interruptions in\n
the supply of new\u00a0N-Ss to remote clinics, and make more difficult
maintaining proper sharps waste disposal systems. Supply interruptions
and limited\n        funds encourage improper recycling\u00a0of what
should be single-use-only N-S. Auto-disabling syringes used in some
settings in developing countries (e.g.,\n        immunizations) do not
yet have needle-shielding features, and are not yet universally
available and used to prevent improper re-use. These problems\n
extend to almost all other sharps needed to provide modern health
care.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Public Health Impact:\n
\u00a0 Reduction in the number of unsafe injections and sharps injuries
will help prevent the spread of HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.\n
\n    \n    \n    \n        Examples of specific research areas of
interest include, but are not limited to:\n        \u00a0 Development of
 appropriate and affordable\u00a0technologies that may contribute to
solving the problems\u00a0of unsafe injection and unsafe sharps
disposal.\n        Examples of such technologies\u00a0-- not to the
exclusion of others, which may be\u00a0materials, methods, techniques,
instruments, or devices \u2013 include: a)\n        plastic

for Systemic HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis",
        "description": "\n    \n        Background:\n        The
HIV\/AIDS pandemic remains among our greatest public health challenges.
More than a quarter century after the description of the first cases
of\n        AIDS, HIV has spread to virtually every country in the world
 infecting 65 million people and killing 25 million. The ongoing high
incidence of HIV\n        infection and the incomplete coverage with
basic HIV prevention tools underscore the need for new, highly effective
 biomedical HIV interventions to\n        complement existing prevention
 strategies. In the absence of a vaccine, the administration of
antiretroviral (ARVs) drugs before HIV exposure\n        (pre-exposure
prophylaxis or PrEP) has gained considerable attention as a strategy to
protect high-risk HIV-negative people from becoming infected.\n
PrEP is a proven concept for other infectious diseases such as malaria,
and multiple lines of evidence suggest that it might also be a
feasible\n        strategy to prevent HIV infection. ARVs drugs
effectively prevent HIV transmission at birth, during breastfeeding, and
 after occupational exposure, and\n        as topical gels can prevent
vaginal transmission. Several clinical trials with daily oral PrEP are
now ongoing in high-risk populations. A reasonable\n        next step
would be to evaluate more practical, less costly drug delivery systems
for humans.\u00a0\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Public Health
Impact:\n        Mathematical models estimate that over the next 10
years an effective PrEP program with daily ARVs could prevent 2.7 to 3.2
 million of the 11 million\n        new HIV-1 infections projected to
occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Model simulations have also shown that an
effective PrEP program could substantially\n        reduce the incidence
 of HIV transmission in populations at high risk of infection in the
United States. This potentially significant public health\n
benefit of PrEP requires a very high efficacy of the drugs and a high
degree of adherence to the PrEP regimen. However, prophylactically
giving people\n        daily ARVs drugs may be costly and impractical,
even if confined to a high-risk population. Thus, special emphasis
should be made on evaluating\n        long-acting drug delivery systems
including injectable biopolymers that entrap and slowly release ARVs
systemically over prolonged (weeks-months)\n        periods of time. If
effective, these systems could substantially decrease the frequency of
ARV dosing, improve adherence, and minimize costs. PrEP with\n
long-acting drug formulations may also provide an attractive prevention
strategy against postnatal HIV acquisition in breast-fed babies.\u00a0\n
    \n    \n    \n    \n        Examples of specific research areas of
interest include, but are not limited to:\n        \u00a0 The
development of novel long-acting drug delivery systems for systemic PrEP
 including injectable bio polimers that entrap and slowly release
ARVs.\n        Designs should include systems for controlled release of
attractive drug candidates for PrEP including HIV reverse transcriptase,
 entry, and integrase\n        inhibitors. Initial studies may
incorporate drug pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies in non-human
primates. Experimental design may include ways to\n        measure drug
levels in blood and tissues and explore correlates of protection.
Studies should be designed with the long-term goal of providing\n
 information that will guide human clinical trials.\n    \n",

     introduce pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should trials soon show
substantial efficacy and safety as expected. Effective use of biomedical
 HIV\n        prevention requires that clinicians and other potential

guidelines for their use, and to\n        identify accessible sources
for provision of them. Mobile devices (e.g., smart phones) and desktop

crashes account for half of all unintentional injury deaths, are the
leading cause of death for people ages 5\u201334 in the United States,
and\n        result in nearly 5 million serious injuries. In one-year,
the cost of medical care and productivity losses associated with traffic
 injuries in the\n        United States exceeded $99 billion. Globally,
road traffic injuries kill 3,000 persons daily.\n    \n    \n    \n
\n        The risk of motor vehicle crashes is highest among teen
drivers age 16- to 19-year-olds. Alcohol is a contributing factor in 37%
 of fatal motor vehicle\n        crashes. In 63%HYPERLINK
"http:\/\/www.car-accidents.com\/pages\/fatal-accident-statistics.html"
of fatal crashes, the occupant killed was not wearing a\n        seat
belt. Excessive speed has been identified as a key risk factor in
traffic injuries, influencing both the risk of a crash and the severity
of the\n        injuries that result.\u00a0\n    \n    \n    \n    \n
     Motor vehicle crashes result from a combination of environmental,
human behavioral, and vehicle-related factors. Modifying any or all can
substantially\n        alter the risks of a crash, and the chances of
survival. The ecological approach that modifying any one factor can
influence all others, and that\n        feedback loops about the
performance of the vehicle, road and environment, and driver fitness
will reduce risks and errors, but this requires adaptive\n
technology. Currently, there are no readily accessible means to warn the
 driver of impending dangers such as perceptual deficits, driver
error,\n        hazardous road conditions and environments, and
suboptimal vehicle performance that may influence crash risks. Nor are
there convenient accessible\n        databases to find affordable
alternative transportation options. Drivers need such tools to make
life-saving decisions easier and more automatic.\u00a0\n    \n    \n
\n    \n        Public Health Impact:\n        \u00a0 Improving safe and
 efficient travel is a universal goal. Reducing traffic crashes and the
injuries that result is a primary goal in public health and\n        one
 of CDC\u2019s Winnable Battles. Reducing speeding, increasing safety
belt use, reducing traffic exposure, and eliminating alcohol-impaired\n
       driving, fatigue and driver distraction as factors in traffic
crashes could save tens of thousands of lives annually and reduce
disabling injuries by\n        more than half, in addition to saving
billions in health care costs.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Examples
 of specific research areas of interest include, but are not limited
to:\n        CDC is particularly interested in the development of
improved environmental, engineering, and human factor controls
(including retrofit vehicle\n        solutions and information
technology to access to alternative forms of transportation) with the
potential to reduce motor vehicle crashes and the\n        injuries that
 result. Development of real-time technologies that deliver to
interventions, such as \u201ccues to safe action\u201d, while driving,
based on\n        driver fitness, vehicle performance characteristics,
environmental conditions, and road -based information. Technology that
can be applied in both\n        occupational driving and private vehicle
 use in domestic and global settings is of high interest, along with
applications of this technology to assist\n        persons with
cognitive or psychomotor limitations (e.g. distracted, drowsy, alcohol

safety of the vast range of food Americans eat; about 80 percent of all
food sold in the United States. This includes\n        everything except
 for the meat, poultry, and processed egg products that are regulated by
 the USDA. Consequently CFSAN seeks research designed to\n
complement and accelerate efforts aimed at the detection, prevention,
and control of contamination that may be responsible for illness or
injury\n        conveyed by foods, colors, and cosmetics. CFSAN conducts
 research, and develops regulations, guidance and standards related to
the composition,\n        quality, nutrition, and safety of food, food
additives, colors, and cosmetics. The Center evaluates FDA\u2019s
surveillance and compliance programs relating\n        to foods, colors,
 and cosmetics; reviews industry petitions, and develops regulations for
 food standards to permit the safe use of color and food\n
additives.\u00a0\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        CFSAN maintains an
active research program that is focused on the following priorities;
ensuring the safety of food, dietary supplements and cosmetics;\n
 improving nutrition; and promoting the security and integrity of the
food supply. The Center\u2019s research activities are intended to;
support the FDA\u2019s\n        regulatory activities; reduce the
incidence of foodborne illness by improving our ability to detect and
quantify foodborne pathogens, toxins, and\n        chemicals that could
jeopardize the safety and security of the food supply; find new and
improved ways to control these agents; and safely produce,\n
process, and handle food and food products. FDA is committed to reducing
 the incidence of foodborne illness to the greatest extent feasible
while at\n        the same time protecting the nation's food supply.
Mission-critical knowledge gaps are addressed through translation
research focused on the risks\n        associated with FDA regulated
products throughout their life cycles, from production to consumption.
Ideally extramural research is sought that\n        complements the
Center\u2019s intramural research efforts, and which will enhance the
Agency\u2019s and the Nation\u2019s ability to reduce the incidence of
foodborne\n        illness and protect the integrity of the
nation\u2019s food supply. FDA\u2019s mission-critical needs require
that the research not simply end with the\n        generation of new

particularly\n        suited to managing surge capacity in high
performance computing. The modeling of many physiologic functions and
bioinformatic analyses can take months\n        or even years to run on a

Objective of this effort is to grow large enough crystals to\nenable
characterization of energy resolution and efficiency for large sized

        "description": "The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) use
 UGS units to detect personnel, vehicles, and aircraft engaged in
illegal activity at the U.S. border. The UGS units consist of: sensor(s)
 for detecting activity; a buried housing that contains a processing
unit that interprets the received signals from the sensor(s) and
performs administrative and control tasks; a radio for communicating
alarms back to a CBP Command Center; and a power supply. An UGS unit
normally employs a microphone to detect acoustic energy generated by the
 target.\nProcessing of the received acoustic signal can provide
information on the time the target passed the UGS, and the
targets\u2019s speed and range. Line-of-bearing and track information in
 near real time is desirable for the Border Patrol (BP) to determine
where a target engaged in illegal activity may be headed. With the
current deployment of single channel microphone UGS units, tracking
information would have to be realized from the use of multiple UGS units
 and correlation of the individual information from them. Deploying
multiple UGS units entails an operational impact and it is desirable to
be able to develop a track solution from a single UGS.\n\nA low cost,
low power, acoustic sensor that can provide directional information in
both heading and altitude (for aircraft) and which can be integrated
with existing UGS units is desired. It should be noted that the acoustic
 signature of some types of targets is narrowband in nature such that
correlation processing of multiple acoustic sensors at the UGS site is
not deemed viable (i.e., Army\u2019s Boomerang sensor unit). A tri-axial
 acoustic sensor would provide the desired functionality for operating
near the border. In order for a tri-axial acoustic sensor to be
reasonable for employment, the cost of the sensor can\u2019t greatly
increase the overall cost of a deployed UGS units. Commercially
available UGS units may range in cost from $2K-$10K depending upon the
vendor. A tri-axial acoustic sensor also should not increase the power
consumption of the UGS markedly either. Sensor power consumption should
be on the order of three times that of a microphone sensor (ignoring
increased processing requirements) when all three channels are used. The
 bandwidth of the directional acoustic sensor should be great enough to
capture the acoustic signature of the different types of
targets.\n\nDirectional acoustic sensors proposed for this solicitation
need to show that their sensitivity or self noise does not markedly
decrease the detection range of a target in comparison to a single
channel microphone. Directional acoustic sensors proposed for this
solicitation also need to address the sensitivity of the sensor to wind
noise and\/or the ability to shield the sensor from wind noise.
Directional acoustic sensors proposed for this solicitation also will
require an alignment capability or an alignment procedure such that
heading measurements can be related to absolute coordinates. It should
be noted that UGS are often deployed at night in a covert fashion and an
 alignment process that compromises the covertness of the deployment
would not be acceptable.\n\nPHASE I: Provide detailed analysis on
sensitivity, self noise, wind noise abatement, directional capability,
power, packaging, alignment, and cost for the proposed sensor.
Consider\/analyze methods for reducing power consumption (i.e.,
initially detecting and classifying a target on a single axis and using
multiple axes only for tracking). Verify the analysis with measured data
 obtained both from laboratory testing and from field testing.\n\nPHASE
II: Work with an UGS manufacturer (approved by DHS S&amp;T) for
interfacing the directional acoustic sensor to their UGS units. The
interface will involve both hardware and software modifications that
will need to be performed by the UGS manufacturer. Laboratory test the
prototype unit for self noise, directional accuracy, power draw, overall
 UGS power change from a single channel microphone configuration, and
alignment accuracy. Field test the\nprototype unit with the directional
acoustic sensor against targets of interest and verify detection range
and tracking capability.\n\nPHASE III: COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Refine
sensor packaging from the Phase II field trials. Market and transition
the directional sensor capability to UGS vendors used by DHS and also
UGS vendors used by the U.S. Army and Marine Corps.\n\n",

complex problem area. Proposers can respond to any of the three
sub-topics listed below (i.e., proposers may submit up to three
different sub-topic proposals in response to this mobile device
forensics topic).\n\nSub-topic 1. NAND\/NOR Chip Forensics \u2013 Flash
memory is now present in a variety of devices including: mobile phones,
iPads, eReaders, thumb drives, picture frames, and laptops.
Investigators require technology to effectively obtain information from
flash memory (both NAND and NOR) chips in a forensically sound
manner.\n\nThere are three issues for law enforcement in this
area:\n\n1.  Reading the data stored on the chip\n\n2.  Reverse
engineering of the wear-leveling algorithm\n\n3.  Mounting the file
system\n\nThe developed capability is envisioned to be a lab tool that
addresses all three of the above issues. This is not intended to be
extended for field use at this time.\n\nSub-topic 2. Bypassing PIN\/PUK
Codes \u2013 GSM, iDen, World Phones, and satellite phones use removable
 Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) and Micro-SIM cards to communicate on a
 cellular network. Without a PIN, an investigator cannot directly access
 data stored on a locked SIM card. Data on the SIM typically includes:
contact lists, call history, SMS messages, and subscriber information.
SIM cards can be locked with a 4-digit Personal Identity Number (PIN)
and an 8- digit Personal Unlocking Key (PUK) that disables direct access
 to, and examination of, data stored on the SIM.\n\nLaw enforcement
investigators require a tool to extract PIN and PUK codes from locked
SIM cards.\n \nSub-topic 3. Disposable Cell Phone Analysis \u2013
Disposable phones (\u201cthrow-away\u201d, \u201cburner\u201d, or
\u201cfast\u201d phones) are frequently used by criminals because they
are inexpensive and do not require a contract, credit card or personal
information. Most disposable phones are GSM based, but CDMA phones are
also available and these handsets either do not have external port
access to retrieve information or access is prohibited in some other
fashion. Law enforcement requires a tool to extract information from
disposable phones.\n\nThis sub-topic will focus on the demonstration and
 development of methods and tools that will allow an investigator to
acquire all: call logs, contacts, pictures, videos, and text messages
stored within all disposable cell phones. The goals of this effort
are:\n\n1.  Demonstrate and implement the capability to acquire the full
 physical memory of the devices in a designated population of disposable
 cell phones in a forensically sound manner.\n\n2.  Demonstrate and
implement the capability to efficiently examine (parse) acquired data
from a designated population of disposable cell phones in a forensically
 sound manner.\n\nPHASE I:\nSub-topic 1. NAND\/NOR Chip Forensics \u2013
 Design a method for comprehensive chip reader and memory parser for
NAND and NOR flash memory chips.\n\nSub-topic 2. Bypassing PIN\/PUK
Codes \u2013 Design a method for a forensically sound tool that will
successfully decrypt SIM cards by acquiring PIN and PUK codes from
locked SIM cards.\n\nSub-topic 3. Disposable Cell Phone Analysis -
Design a method to acquire physical memory from a designated population
of disposable cell phones in a forensically sound manner.\n\nPHASE
II:\nSub-topic 1. NAND\/NOR Chip Forensics \u2013 Demonstrate and
implement hardware and software applications for development of a
comprehensive chip reading and memory parsing tool for NAND and NOR
flash memory chips. The tool should be developed for law enforcement and
 forensic examiner use and, where possible, should be delivered as open
source technology.\n\nSub-topic 2. Bypassing PIN\/PUK Codes \u2013
Demonstrate and implement hardware and software applications for
development of a forensically sound tool that will successfully decrypt
SIM cards by acquiring PIN and PUK codes from locked SIM cards. The tool
 should be developed for law enforcement and forensic examiner use and,
where possible, should be delivered as open source
technology.\n\nSub-topic 3. Disposable Cell Phone Analysis \u2013
Demonstrate and implement hardware and software tools required to
acquire and efficiently examine physical memory data from a designated
population of disposable cell phones in a forensically sound manner. The
 tool should be developed for law enforcement and forensic examiner use
and, where possible, should be delivered as open source
technology.\n\nPHASE III: COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: All sub-topics - The
final developed tools will be marketable to a wide variety of Federal,
State, and local law enforcement agencies. It is anticipated that those
tools delivered as open source technology will require support, custom
extensions, and additional applications as new mobile device
technologies are commercially introduced.\n",

        "topic_name": "Iris Image Quality Tool Suite for Biometric
Recognition",
        "description": "Biometric system performance depends on the
quality of the acquired input samples. If sample quality can be
improved, whether by sensor design, user interface design, or standards
compliance, better performance can be realized. For those aspects of
quality that cannot be designed-in, an ability to analyze the image and
identify recognition-related defects and problems is needed. The ability
 to quickly acquire knowledge about sample quality can aid in deciding
whether to initiate reacquisition from a subject, in real-time selection
 of the best sample from a set of samples, and in the selective
invocation of different processing methods. Automated quality assessment
 is also useful for other purposes. In an enterprise context, image
quality assessments can reveal trends, or time and location specific
instances of poor image capture practices. For example, if operational
collections consistently produce poor iris quality samples, it can
indicate that additional training is needed or that screening may be
better served by using another biometric modality.\n\nQuality analysis
is a technical challenge because it is most helpful when measures
reflect the performance sensitivities of one or more target biometric
matchers. To help facilitate universal interoperability of iris data
across cameras and matchers, the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), supported by the Department of Homeland Security,
completed Iris Exchange (IREX) II Iris Quality Calibration and
Evaluation (IQCE). This work identifies iris image properties that
influence different vendor\u2019s recognition accuracy and quantifies
their effects. It is expected that this work will inform the development
 of the international standard ISO\/IEC 29794 Biometric sample quality -
 Part 6: Iris image data.\n\nThis topic area seeks to enable innovative
research that will contribute to efforts to develop, evaluate, and
publish precise computation methods for quality metrics and increase the
 availability of commercial grade iris image quality software tools
capable of operating on embedded, desktop, and server
platforms.\n\nPHASE I: Develop, evaluate, and document precise
computation methods for quality metrics that are identified by IQCE to
influence recognition performance.\n\nPHASE II: Develop a suite of
software tools designed to function on a variety of platforms to provide
 image quality assessment information implementing the quality metrics
established in Phase I.\n\nPHASE III: COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Optimize
and validate computation methods that yield quantitative scores that
predict cross camera and matcher recognition outcomes on avariety of
hardware platforms. Develop, market and license software packages
tailored to operate on different platforms that will perform this
function.\n",

        "topic_name": "Intelligent \u201cObject\u201d Symbology",
        "description": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is
committed to using cutting- edge technologies and scientific talent in
its quest to make America safer. The International Committee for
Information Technology Standards (ANSI INCITS) 415-2006, Homeland
Security Mapping Standard - Point Symbology for Emergency Management
establishes point symbols focused exclusively on the emergency
management and emergency responder communities. DHS includes component
organizations such as FEMA, CBP, USCG, and NPPD, whose missions
encompass areas outside emergency management, such as law enforcement
and intelligence analysis. These require symbology standards and
techniques above and beyond that which is provided by ANSI INCITS
415-2006.\n\nThe Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Directorate is working
 on the next generation of geospatial web mapping and symbology
technologies to identify challenges and develop recommendations on
mission relevant applied research to address these challenges. DHS has a
 wide \u201cspectrum\u201d of missions. As a result, a one size fits all
 symbology standard for the entire department is not practical in this
environment with broad ranging practices, methodologies, and
applications across the components. The current practice requires users
to identify data, extract information, create or reuse existing
symbology, and manually apply these symbols within geo-spatial
applications. Additionally, the end users have to manually link
information or Meta data to symbology in order for it to be
interpretable and interoperable. This current practice is time consuming
 and creates room for errors.\n\nThere is a need for an automated,
dynamic application that ingests, processes, and analyzes data from a
combination of sources and presents interpreted data in a meaningful way
 to provide the end user with valuable and accurate information relevant
 to their specific needs or functions. In order to address these
challenges, DHS is looking at the concept of Intelligent Symbology, an
active dynamic object or agent that is able to interpret information and
 provide the appropriate symbol automatically to the end user. In other
words, this application technology will search and assess data
(structured\/unstructured text) from pre-defined data sources such as
Law\nEnforcement and Public Safety RSS feeds, bulletins, and other
applications for key words and geo co-ordinates such as \u201cfire at
500 Elm Street\u201d and identify the appropriate symbology to
accurately represent the feature and event on a viewer or geospatial
application.\n\nThis effort goes beyond just analyzing and tagging
\u201cfree\u201d text and geo co-ordinates, and uses dynamic symbology
and attribution. For example, the state of a symbol is dynamically
updated to reflect relevant changes to the underlying data within a
specified time window. Using the same fire example mentioned above, the
applications technology would be able to analyze data sources to
determine the current event status of the fire incident and its effect
on occupants or surrounding areas and find the appropriate fire symbol
and dynamic attribution to accurately\nrepresent this information.
Secondly, the application technology should be able to determine data
\u201cpedigree\u201d, which would allow the end user to extract
additional information from a symbol at the application level. Meaning,
at the application level, the user should be able to view all Meta\ndata
 and information related to an incident, its location, and the data
sources thereby allowing the user to validate the integrity of the data
and determine how to safely and effectively respond to the
incident.\n\nEssentially, this Intelligent \u201cObject\u201d would
actively query data sources for specified types of data that can be
identified, symbolized and geo-coded to support business intelligence,
mashups and data analytics on the content. The results will provide: 1)
meaningful information to the end user,\n2) the appropriate symbology
automatically portrayed to represent that data (it is assumed that the
symbols are vetted and cataloged in the data dictionary), and 3) the
ability for the end user to drill down on a symbol to access more
information pertaining to the incident or event.\n\nPHASE I: Research
and assess the concept proposed, and work in close collaboration with
DHS to develop various approaches and methodologies for ingesting,
integrating, analyzing, and representing data within the context of
geospatial intelligence and information sharing. Use the ANSI INCITS
415-2006 as the base standard. Develop and demonstrate two or more proof
 of concept applications or widgets that support the chosen
methodologies. Propose relevant performance metrics to be used in
assessing the accuracy of the proposed approach.\n\nPHASE II: Develop
and deliver a working prototype application that is compatible with
popular browsers and geospatial applications from major vendors such as
ESRI, Microsoft, and Google. Provide and test the prototype application
and related source code, documentation, data and other necessary
artifacts as required for migration of the prototype application into
the DHS Geospatial Information Infrastructure (GII) infrastructure.
Implement agreed upon performance metrics to\nbe used in assessing the
accuracy of the proposed approach.\n\nPHASE III: COMMERCIAL
APPLICATIONS: Further develop the prototype into a working product and
provide it as a plug-in service or widget to major geospatial vendors
such as ESRI, Microsoft, and Google.\n",

and Data Analysis Systems\nIt is anticipated that innovative and
improved alcohol sensors would be useful in a variety of situations
including, but not limited to, clinical monitoring, forensics and human
or animal research. Specific sensor characteristics would complement
their intended use. This applies to characteristics such as sampling
frequency, degree of accuracy, data storage capacity and data
transmission frequency. \nDepending on their intended purpose and use,
alcohol sensors may be augmented with additional information such as
other physiological measurements or geospatial determinations. Devices
need to be compatible with human comfort, and devices to be worn for
weeks or months may present particular challenges. Since alcohol
readings are likely to be baseline most of the time, these sensing
devices generally require ways to monitor contact and readiness to
record. Moreover, where necessary, measurement fidelity should be robust
 to subject's activities including active efforts at tampering.\nThe
mode of data storage will need to conform to power limitations and
strategies for data transmission which may require telemetry. \nIn
addition to alcohol monitoring and data transmission this program also
includes the opportunity to develop appropriate data analysis systems.
Examples include: estimating blood alcohol concentrations,
reconstructing patterns of alcohol consumption, and monitoring large
numbers of devices to identify significant, but infrequent, events while
 minimizing false positives.\nR. Thomas Gentry,
Ph.D.\n301-443-6009\nEmail: Tom.Gentry@nih.gov\nPromoting Adherence to
Medical, Pharmacologic, and Behavioral Treatments for Alcohol Use
Disorders \nSeveral recent reports and literature reviews point to the
continuing need for improving adherence to therapeutic regimens.
Adherence rates vary considerably across diseases and treatments,
measuring instruments, and populations, with rates ranging from 30% to
60% in many instances. The reasons for non-adherence are multifaceted.
Health-care providers, organizational systems, and patient factors all
play a role in adherence to therapeutic regimens. Thus, to understand
and eventually improve adherence, conceptual frameworks and
interventions need to take into account institutional, system,
situational, interpersonal, and personal factors as well as the
characteristics of the illness or condition and of the treatment
regimen. While extensive research exists and successful techniques have
been identified, greater efforts are needed to develop and implement
programs based upon these findings. Applications are sought to
develop:\nA.\tPrograms to implement effective interventions and to
evaluate their implementation.\nB.\tProfessional education courses or
web-based training modules on interventions and to monitor their
effectiveness.\nIn both cases, the emphasis is on how to encourage
health practitioners to utilize interventions that will improve their
patients\u2019 adherence to medical, pharmacologic, and behavioral
regimens for alcohol abuse and dependence.\nMargaret E. Mattson,

area of interest focuses on the development and evaluation of innovative
 prevention and intervention programs, or specific materials for
integration into existing programs, which utilize state-of-the-art
technology and are based on currently accepted clinical and behavioral
strategies. Applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with research
methodologists and statisticians to ensure that state-of-the-art
approaches to design, analysis, and interpretation of studies under this
 topic are used. Areas that may be of interest to small businesses
include, but are not limited to:\nA.\tDevelopment and evaluation of
innovative prevention\/intervention programs, or specific materials for
integration into existing programs, which utilize state-of-the-art
technology and are based on currently accepted clinical and behavioral
strategies. Special emphasis should be placed on the needs of high-risk
groups, ethnic and minority populations, youth, children of alcoholics,
women, the handicapped, and the elderly. Examples of such materials
include school-based curricula, interactive videos, computer-based
multimedia programs, training manuals for teachers or parents, and
community-based programs.\nB.\tDevelopment and evaluation of educational
 materials designed to intervene with the elderly around specific
age-related risks for alcohol problems. Particular attention should be
given to age-related reductions in alcohol tolerance, interactions
between alcohol and prescription and over-the-counter medications,
possible exacerbation of some medical conditions common among the
elderly, potential biomedical and behavioral consequences of excessive
alcohol use, and the role of alcohol in falls, fires, burns, pedestrian
and traffic injuries, and other unintentional injuries.\nC.\tDevelopment
 and evaluation of statistical analysis programs tailored to the design
and analysis of alcohol prevention-relevant research. Programs could
focus on a variety of areas including: imputation of missing data under
varying design assumptions; simulation of distributions of outcomes
based on varying mixtures of sample populations; application of chronic
or infectious disease models to targeted communities; and models of the
potential effect of various policy-based interventions, such as
increased taxation or reduction of outlet density by license revocation
and control.\nRobert C. Freeman, Ph.D.\n301-443-8820\nEmail:

Problems\nResearch projects are sought that will expand knowledge and
improve delivery of alcohol treatment and prevention services. The
research objectives include, but are not limited to, the effects of
organizational structures and financing mechanisms on the availability,
accessibility, utilization, delivery, content, quality, outcomes, and
costs of alcohol treatment services. Objectives also include studying
the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alcohol prevention services
in reducing the demand for health care services and improving the
methodological tools useful for conducting health services research.

defensible as measures of the true opportunity costs of providing
alcohol treatment services. Such software might be bundled with billing
software.\nRobert Huebner, Ph.D.\n301-443-4344 \nEmail:
Bob.Huebner@nih.gov\nFetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) and
Alcohol-Related Birth Defects\nFASD is the collective term for the broad
 array of documented adverse effects resulting from in utero alcohol
exposure. The most serious of these is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a
devastating developmental disorder characterized by craniofacial
abnormalities, growth retardation, and nervous system impairments that
may include mental retardation. Other diagnostic categories include
partial FAS, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), and
alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). Children and adults with FASD may
exhibit multiple cognitive, behavioral, and emotional deficits that
impair daily functioning in many domains. The NIAAA supports research
leading to improved diagnosis and assessment of impairment and
disability, as well as the development of tools to enhance academic and
daily living skills. Areas that may be of interest to small businesses
include, but are not limited to:\nA.\tDevelopment and assessment of

Marcia.Scott@nih.gov\nAlcohol Use and HIV, HBV, or HCV
Infection\nAlcohol use, including hazardous drinking, by persons
infected with HIV, HBV, and HCV, is quite common in the United States.
Alcohol consumption is widely acknowledged as a co-factor in the sexual
transmission, susceptibility to infection, and progression of the
infectious diseases. However, detailed relationships between alcohol use
 and viral infections, diseases progression, antiretroviral therapy and
adverse outcomes, notably in liver disease progression, are less
recognized or understood. Recent research indicates that inflammatory
pathways predominate in alcoholic hepatitis whereas adaptive immunity
plays a primary role in viral hepatitis, offering multiple targets for
novel preventive and therapeutic interventions. Comprehensive studies to
 improve understanding of the factors underlying alcohol and viral
etiologies in liver disease and the impact of antiretroviral drugs on
liver disease progression are needed. A better understanding of
alcohol\u2019s effects on liver disease in patients with HIV\/HBV\/HCV
infection may improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes. NIAAA supports
research leading to improved diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-induced
disorders in people infected with HIV, HBV, or HCV. \nAreas that may be
of interest to small businesses include, but are not limited
to:\nA.\tNew preventive and therapeutic approaches designed to protect
the liver from alcohol and antiretroviral drug-induced liver injury in

neuroimaging, and simulators of alcohol impairment. Areas that may be of
 interest to small businesses include, but are not limited
to:\nA.\tDevelopment of novel animal models, including transgenic
animals, possessing specific traits of significance for the study of
alcoholism, or for the study of specific pathologic disease states which
 arise from excessive alcohol consumption.\nB.\tDevelopment of a

\nDevelopment of Biomolecular Signatures of Alcohol Exposure and
Alcohol-induced Tissue Injury\nAcute and chronic alcohol consumption
leads to health-related complications and ultimately to significant
societal costs. Quantitative and qualitative markers of high-risk
drinking behavior and alcohol-induced tissue damage would greatly
improve medical efforts to recognize and treat alcohol-related
disorders. Traditional biomarkers currently in clinical use lack
specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy, and fail to provide long-term
information. Biomarkers of sufficient reliability, sensitivity and
specificity are likely to be comprised of a panel of physiological
parameters, rather than a single molecular entity. Thus, NIAAA seeks to
support the discovery and development of pattern-based molecular
fingerprints or signatures of alcohol consumption and of alcohol-induced
 tissue injury. High throughput approaches using genomics, epigenomics,
transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipomics, or glycomics are
encouraged. Biomarker signatures may be composed of multiple genes,
RNAs, microRNAs, proteins, or metabolites, or combinations thereof.
Furthermore, alterations in lipid, lipoprotein, or glycoprotein profiles
 may reflect the metabolic effects of alcohol exposure and may be
considered as potentially predictive. Biomarker signatures that address
multiple aspects of alcohol consumption and alcohol damage are needed.
These include, but are not limited to:\nA.\tBiomarkers of long-term
alcohol consumption. A biomarker panel reflecting the cumulative intake
of alcohol over a period of months or more would be of great diagnostic
use, both in terms of recognizing problem drinking and in terms of the
potential for organ damage.\nB.\tBiomarkers that distinguish between
binge, acute, moderate and chronic drinking. Each of these modes of
alcohol intake has different physiological effects. The ability to
distinguish dose and timing of drinking would enhance clinicians\u2019
ability to design appropriate treatment and intervention protocols.
\nC.\tBiomarkers of compliance after withdrawal. Biomarker signatures in
 this class would be comprised of metabolic products that decrease
rapidly upon abstinence, in contrast to the characteristics of
biomarkers that reflect cumulative alcohol. The ability to detect
relapse accurately will support successful behavioral
interventions.\nD.\tBiomarker signatures of alcohol-induced organ
damage. The damage due to alcohol consumption is likely to be
organ-specific, with signatures reflecting alcohol-induced damage likely
 to be different for heart damage, liver damage, encephalopathy, a
dysregulated immune system, or other alcohol target.\nE.\tBiomarker
signatures of familial risk factors for alcoholism. Early identification
 of subjects predisposed to alcoholism will allow for early
intervention, and allow the subject to make informed decisions.\nKathy
Jung, Ph.D.\n301-443-8744\nEmail: Mary.Jung@nih.gov\nClinical Testing of
 Biochemical Markers\nThe development of effective biochemical markers
represents a powerful means for early diagnosis and treatment of alcohol
 dependent\/abuse patients and for the identification of individuals who
 have a predisposition for alcoholism. There are two different types of
biochemical markers: trait markers and state markers.\nTrait biomarkers
have the ability to detect inborn characteristics of individuals who are
 vulnerable for alcoholism. This type of marker would be invaluable for
screening of high-risk individuals (e.g., children of alcoholics) and
targeting them with preventive or early treatment interventions. In
addition, trait markers might assist practitioners in identifying
subpopulations of alcoholics who may need different treatment
strategies. An ideal trait marker should have several features. First,
it should display validity in detecting people susceptible to
alcoholism, particularly before the onset of alcoholism or during
periods of stable abstinence. Second, it should be easily and reliably
measured. Third, it should be specific for alcoholism only and not
affected by other medical or psychiatric disorders or drugs. Since
alcoholism is a complex disease, it is likely that more than one type of
 gene and protein exist as trait marker.\nState markers or markers of
alcohol consumption serve several important purposes. First, they can
assist physicians in diagnosing individuals with chronic drinking
problems, particularly patients who deny excessive drinking. Moreover,
they may also identify individuals in early stages of heavy drinking,
thus avoiding the long-term medical, psychological, and social
consequences of chronic alcoholism. Second, state biomarkers can aid in
the diagnosis and treatment of other diseases (liver diseases,
pancreatitis, and cardiovascular diseases) that were, at least, caused
by excessive drinking. Third, they are useful in alcohol treatment and
prevention programs. Since the goal of many of programs is abstinence,
monitoring relapse is important in gauging success. Last, state
biomarkers are important in clinical alcohol trials. Although
self-reports have become more sophisticated and valid (e.g., Timeline
Followback), they still rely on accurate reporting. These new and
reliable biomarkers could then be used to confirm the self-report.
Several biomarkers with certain limitations are currently in use
including carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT), gamma-glutamyl
transferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). New state
markers need to be developed that incorporate the following attributes:
validity, reliability, stability, cost, practicability, acceptability,
and transportability.\nAreas that may be of interest to small businesses
 include, but are not limited to:\nA.\tDevelop and evaluate clinically
alcohol-sensitive biomarkers to identify individuals who are predisposed
 to alcoholism; determine relapse; measure levels of drinking; and
determine alcohol-induced tissue damage.\nB.\tIdentify genes, and
proteins that are expressed during the development of alcohol dependence
 for biomarker development.\nC.\tDevelop methodologies for high
throughput identification of alcohol metabolites and other signaling
molecules that are expressed during alcohol intake.\nD.\tUse knowledge
of genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced organ
damage (including alcohol-related liver, pancreas, heart disease and
FAS) to develop new biomarkers of tissue and cell damage.\nE.\tEvaluate
clinically innovative alcohol-sensitive biomarkers (trait, relapse,
organ damage) for sensitivity and specificity.\nRaye Z. Litten,

Alcohol-induced Disorders\nStem cells are master cells in the body and
they have the remarkable potential to develop into many different cell
types. Stem cells may become a renewable source of replacement cells to
treat alcohol related diseases. They can also be used to study disease
processes, and to develop new and more effective drugs. \nRecent
research progress on stem cells has offered great opportunities to study
 conditions and diseases related to alcohol abuse and alcoholism. Stem
cells can come from embryos or adult tissues. They are generally
categorized into 1) Embryonic stem cells; 2) Induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPS cells); and 3) Adult stem cells. The NIAAA supports
SBIR\/STTR research using any of these 3 types of stem cell, which can
lead to improved understanding of alcohol related diseases and
conditions, and better treatment. \nAreas that may be of interest to
small businesses include, but are not limited to:\nA.\tGenerate and
disseminate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) from mature human cells
 to resemble diverse individual variations regarding alcohol metabolism.
 Use these genetic variant models to study alcohol dependence and
pharmacotherapy development. Examples of these genetic variations
include Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH), Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH),
cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2E1, and Glutathione S transferase (GST).
\nB.\tGenerate and disseminate disease-specific iPS cell lines for
studies on the biology and signaling pathways that contribute to the
alcohol-related disease pathology.\nC.\tStudy the potential of using
patient-specific iPS cells for cell replacement therapies to treat
alcohol-caused tissue damages.\nPeter Gao, M.D.\n301-443-6106\nEmail:
Peter.Gao@nih.gov\nReal-time Detection of Neurochemical Changes in
Response to Alcohol Drinking\nMany pharmacological mechanisms of ethanol
 action in the brain are mediated by time-dependent neurochemical events
 in multiple brain regions. Despite great progress in identifying
ethanol\u2019s neurochemical actions, we do not fully know how
neurochemicals change in real time following ethanol administration and
drinking (acute and chronic). Multidimensional measurement of
neurochemical change (i.e., concentration, time, region) are needed to
reveal kinetics underlying alcohol effects to guide future medication
development and promote mechanistic understanding of alcohol drinking.
\nWith this SBIR\/STTR grant solicitation, NIAAA seeks development of
biosensors enabling monitoring of regional neurochemical changes in the
brains of rats and\/or mice in real time as they drink alcohol. Recent
studies report the plausibility of using microsensors coupled with
wireless detection methods to instantaneously monitor multiple
neurochemical changes in animals. NIAAA seeks development of
microsensors with sufficient resolution to provide neuroanatomical
regional specificity. In addition to brain ethanol concentration,
neurochemicals of interest include, but are not limited to, glutamate,
dopamine, GABA, acetylcholine, and signaling molecules. Work under this
solicitation should be directed toward the development of commercial
strategies for the real-time measurement of extracellular neurochemical
and brain ethanol concentrations in behaving animals.\nChanghai Cui,

Hematology. The Cancer Immunology and Hematology Branch (CIHB) supports a
 broad spectrum of basic research focused on the earliest stages of
hematopoiesis and tracing the molecular events that lead to the
development of all the functional elements of the immune system and,
when errors occur, to the development of leukemias and lymphomas. Most
research of interest falls into three major areas. The first is the
immune response to tumors to include studies of all of the cells (T, B,
NK, antigen-presenting, and other myeloid cells) and secreted molecules
(antibodies and cytokines) of the immune system that can recognize and
affect tumor growth. Emphasis is placed on the alteration in the
mechanisms responsible for the failure of immune response to eradicate
most tumors under normal conditions, and the development of strategies
to circumvent these mechanisms. A second major area of interest examines
 the biology of hematopoietic malignancies to describe the molecular
biology reasons underlying the cell's failure to respond to normal
growth controls and to develop novel approaches to prevention or
therapy. The third distinct area supported is the basic biology of
bone-marrow transplantation, including studies of host cell engraftment,
 graft-versus-host disease, and the basis of the graft-versus-leukemia
effect. Specific research and technologies supported by CIHB include but
 are not limited to the following:\n1.\tDevelopment of improved or novel
 monoclonal antibody technologies including improvements of
methodologies for fusion, production of novel cells as fusion partners,

community, in part through various outreach activities. The outreach
requirement generates the need for innovative educational or
informational materials that convey the content of Consortium meetings
and symposia, or document hands-on workshops in which models or
techniques that are pertinent to mouse modeling are demonstrated. The
instructional materials may be CD-ROMs, videotapes, Web-based
interactive programs, or other media.\nF.\tStructural Biology and

 and Metastasis. This branch supports research that seeks to understand
the interactions of cancer cells with the tumor and\/or host
microenvironment in order to delineate the molecular mechanisms and
signaling pathways of tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, cell
migration and invasion, tumor progression, and metastasis. This includes
 examination of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and the roles
played by cell growth factors and cytokines, adhesion molecules,
cytoskeleton and the nuclear matrix, and matrix-degrading enzymes, as
well as studies on the pathology and biology of solid tumors and tumor
bearing animals, and the development of technology to facilitate these
studies. Emerging areas of emphasis are the microenvironment created by
inflammation and the inflammatory signaling molecules in tumor
initiation and progression and the role of somatic stem cells in
determining tumor progression and metastatic behavior. Stem cell
motility, positional information cues from surrounding tissue and
adhesion properties together with issues of epithelial-mesenchymal
transitions related to cancer progression are supported. Emphasis is
also placed on the role of the extracellular matrix and tissue
microenvironment during development and tissue morphogenesis, and on the
 role of glycoproteins in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. The
branch also focuses on the function of steroid hormones, their receptors
 and coregulators during tumor growth and progression. Models utilized
in these studies may include animal models, tumor tissues\/cells, their
components, or their products. The development of organotypic models
that closely mimic in vivo models is encouraged. Specific research and

Renewal Awards\nNIDA will accept SBIR\/STTR Phase IIB Competing Renewal
grant applications from Phase II SBIR\/STTR awardees to continue the
process of developing products that require approval of a Federal
regulatory agency. Such products include, but are not limited to:
medical implants, drugs, vaccines, and new treatment or diagnostic tools
 that require FDA approval. This renewal grant should allow small
businesses to get to a stage where interest and investment by third
parties is more likely.\nTransitioning a new molecular entity from
preclinical to the clinical phase of development, requires large-scale
production of the new molecular entity and toxicity testing, activities
which are both costly and time consuming. The cost and time constraints
imposed by advanced stage development of a new molecular entity pose
significant obstacles for small businesses. Although Phase I and Phase
II SBIR support is sufficient for initial discovery efforts (e.g.,
compound synthesis and some in vitro and in vivo preclinical
pharmacological testing), it is not adequate to support either the kind
of developmental work needed for compliance with the FDA\u2019s
requirement for an investigational new drug (IND), or for clinical
trials.\nThis announcement adds another three years of support to SBCs
for drug development by providing a second stage of Phase II SBIR
funding through the mechanism of a Phase IIB SBIR Competing Renewal
grant. It is recognized that an award of this type may not support the
entire medications development timeline for any given drug. The
Competing Renewal grant will however, allow small businesses to carry a
medication from the preclinical to the clinical stage, which will aid in
 attracting interest and investment by third, parties, and provide an
important resource for new pharmaceuticals for the treatment of
substance abuse.\nPlease contact Kris Bough (contact information
provided below) before beginning the process of putting an application
together. Prospective applicants are strongly encouraged to contact NIH
staff prior to submission of a Phase IIB Competing Renewal application.
Prospective applicants are strongly encouraged to submit to the program
contact a letter of intent that includes the following
information:\n\u2022\tDescriptive title of the proposed research
\n\u2022\tName, address, and telephone number of the Principal
Investigator \n\u2022\tNames of other key personnel
\n\u2022\tParticipating institutions \nAlthough a letter of intent is
not required, is not binding, and does not enter into the review of a
subsequent application, the information that it contains allows NIH
staff to estimate the potential review workload and plan the review. It
is expected that only a portion of NIDA SBIR\/STTR Phase II awards will
be eligible for a Phase IIB Competing Renewal grant.\nThe following
examples would make appropriate topics for proposed SBIR or STTR Phase
IIB Competing Renewal projects. These are meant for illustrative
purposes only and are not exclusive of other appropriate activities.
\nResearch and development efforts can be focused on medications for the
 treatment of cocaine, methamphetamine, and other stimulant abuse, as
well as towards opiate, cannabis, PCP and club drugs. The medications
under development should be targeted towards attainment of abstinence,
maintenance, and\/or relapse prevention.\n\u2022\tPreclinical studies,
including pharmacology and toxicology, beyond those conducted under the
initial SBIR Phase I and Phase II grants. The studies conducted under
the previous grants should be sufficient to provide a sound rationale
for continued development of the entity or entities.\n\u2022\tCompletion

 and Behavioral Research (DBNBR)\nDBNBR\u2019s basic neuroscience and
behavioral research focuses on understanding the mechanisms,
characteristics, and processes of drug abuse both in adult and
developing organisms. Basic behavioral, cognitive, neurobiological,
cellular, molecular, chemical, and genetics research aims at
characterizing and understanding drug seeking, compulsive behavior, and
addictive processes. These research areas necessarily include studies of
 normal processes. Using both animal and human studies, basic behavioral
 research focuses on behavioral and cognitive processes that may or do
lead to drug initiation, and the behavioral and cognitive consequences
of drug abuse. Neurobiology research focuses on the neural mechanisms
and substrates underlying behavioral and cognitive processes and
vulnerability factors associated with drug abuse, addiction,
sensitization, tolerance, and relapse. DBNBR also supports basic
chemistry and pharmacological studies focusing on structure\/activity
relationships, definition, and characterization of systems involved in
drug actions, chemical synthesis of new ligands, pharmacokinetics,
analytical methods, understanding basic mechanisms of drug action and
drug testing. The focus of maternal and paternal drug use is to
ascertain the consequences of drug exposure on brain development as well
 as on other physiological systems.\nComputational and theoretical
modeling of biological systems and behavioral processes, biomedical
computing and\/or information science and technology development is
supported by DBNBR.\n1.\tMetabolomics in Drug Abuse Research.
Metabolomics is the study of all molecules of a cell or organism and
their identification and quantification that helps to understand the
cellular regulation, metabolic pathways and activity and response under
normal and other conditions. This technique thus could be used to
develop metabolic profiling of normal or healthy subjects and subjects
under the influence of substances of abuse or those undergoing drug
rehabilitation programs.\n\tNIDA is looking for applications on
development of novel metabolomics technologies toward practical
application in pathway and network investigation in biological systems
particularly in understanding the mechanisms of drug addiction and
discovering biomarkers for developing treatment for drug addiction.
\n\tPhase I application should demonstrate the feasibility of developing
 new metabolomics technology and phase II should focus on the
application of this technology in drug abuse research.\nHari H. Singh,

 Drug Delivery Dosage Forms for Drugs Abuse Studies.  SBIR applications
are solicited to design and develop alternate dosage forms for drugs
that are not orally administered such as nicotine, marijuana, heroin,
etc. Phase I should demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
innovation and Phase II, the development and testing of the
innovation.\nHari H. Singh, Ph.D.\n301-443-1887\nE-mail:
hs87j@nih.gov\n3.\tDiscovery of New Chemical Probes.  SBIR applications
are solicited to discover new chemical compounds as biological probes
either by synthesis or isolation from natural resources in studying the
mechanisms of action of drugs of abuse. Such substances could be new
chemical compounds, drug products, or peptides. Currently there are
several ligands available through the NIDA drug supply system such as SR
 141716A, SR144528, CP 55,840, anandamide, epibatidine, Kaffiralin 1 and
 2, etc. All probes for cannabinoids, neuropeptides, nicotinic
acetylcholinergic receptors and related probes for drug abuse study are
encouraged. In addition applications on biological screening of such new
 compounds as potential ligands for drug abuse research will also be
considered.\n\tPhase I should demonstrate the feasibility of the
proposed innovation and Phase II, the development, characterization,
testing, and screening of innovation. It should also be demonstrated
that the new or modified chemical compounds are suitable for drug abuse
research.\nRao S. Rapaka, Ph.D.\n301-443-1887\nEmail:

Botanicals.  NIDA is looking for applications to develop methods for the
 isolation, purification, identification and characterization of active
and inactive ingredients of herbal plants (stimulants, hallucinogenic,
analgesics, and\/or narcotics) and evaluation of their biological
properties. Such studies may include chemistry, toxicology,
pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and the mechanisms of action of
active and inactive ingredients to understand their efficacy,
usefulness, adverse effects and abuse potential.\n\tPhase I should
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed innovation and Phase II, the
 development, characterization, testing, and screening of
innovation.\nRao S. Rapaka, Ph.D.\n301-443-1887\nEmail:

Reality (VR) exposure can reduce reported pain during wound care. Grant
applications are sought to examine the utility of VR technologies in the
 treatment of various types of pain. Development of treatments for both
acute and chronic pain is sought. These treatments can be based in
clinical settings or the patients\u2019 homes. Phase I testing should
establish the feasibility of the use of this technology in the
particular population to be tested. Phase I should also produce data
that demonstrates that this methodology is effective for the particular
type of pain being treated. Phase II should involve larger-scale testing
 (e.g., more subjects and treatment trials) examining various treatment
parameters (e.g., timing of treatment, types of VR environments). The
focus of Phase II testing should be the refinement of this treatment for
 use in pain patients.\nDavid Thomas, Ph.D.\n301-435-1313\nEmail:
dt78k@nih.gov\n6.\tVirtual Reality for the Treatment of Drug Abuse.
Virtual Reality (VR) can be a useful clinical tool. In this particular
study, VR exposure was used to allow patients to selectively not attend
to an otherwise painful procedure. Drug abuse, like pain, is a problem
that is strongly impacted by stimuli in the abuser\u2019s environment
and psychological factors. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that VR may
be useful in allowing individuals to ignore drugs cravings, withdrawal
symptoms or environmental cues that promote drug abuse. Grant
applications are sought to examine the utility of VR technologies in the
 treatment of various types of drug abuse. These treatments can be based
 in clinical settings or the patients' homes. These treatments can be
developed to address drug withdrawal, drug craving or on-going drug
related behaviors. The development of VR technologies to address abuse
of all types of drugs (e.g., cocaine, marijuana, nicotine, alcohol,
inhalants) is sought. Phase I testing should establish the feasibility
of the use of this technology for the particular drug problem addressed
(e.g., cocaine craving, opioid withdrawal) and should also produce data
that demonstrates that this methodology is effective for the particular
drug problem. Phase II should involve larger-scale testing (e.g., more
subjects and treatment trials) examining various treatment parameters
(e.g., timing of treatment, types of VR environments). The focus of
Phase II testing should be the refinement of this treatment for use in
the treatment of drug abusers.\nDavid Thomas,

Reality Environment for Teaching about the Impact of Drug Abuse on the
Brain.  Virtual reality (VR) is emerging as a technology with a
multitude of uses within the medical sciences. In terms of the science
of drug abuse, it is being developed as a treatment tool. The current
solicitation seeks the development of a virtual reality environment that
 can be used in educational settings to teach about how drugs of abuse
(both illicit and licit) affect the brain and behavior. \n\tThe cost of
portable hardware needed to present a VR environment is relatively
inexpensive. If education programs like the one sought in this
solicitation were available, it is likely that VR would be used as a
teaching tool in many settings, including classrooms and museums.
\n\tThe particular program sought here is to present an interactive
three-dimensional virtual brain that shows normal brain functions and,
in contrast, brain function after exposure to drugs of abuse. This
technology could illustrate the neurotoxic and long-term effects of drug
 abuse on the brain. This VR may include other features that are not
described above, provided that it will be useful in educating
individuals about the medical, behavioral and social effects of drug
abuse. \n\tThe phase I application should develop a beta version of the
program. Further, the phase I application should include a preliminary
demonstration of \u201cusability,\u201d where it is shown that the types
 of people being educated with this program (e.g. teachers) can
effectively operate this system without extensive training. Further, it
should be demonstrated that the hardware is easily worn by subjects, and
 that the subjects can rapidly understand how to effectively interact in
 the VR environment. \nDavid Thomas, Ph.D.\n301-435-1313\nEmail:

Abuse Treatment.  Nanoscience and nanotechnology, by manipulating matter
 at the atomic or molecular levels, are emerging research areas that
have the potential to fundamentally transform the study of biological
systems and lead to the development of new methods for detection,
prevention, and treatment of substance abuse and related disease states.
 NIDA invites nanotechnology-based applications in the following
areas:\na.\tMethods to enhance the efficacy of FDA-approved compounds by
 reducing their size to the nanoscale range to alter absorption,
distribution, metabolism, or excretion.\nb.\tDevelopment of new
compounds, through manipulation of matter at the atomic or molecular
levels that could more readily pass the blood-brain-barrier or cell
membranes.\nc.\tDevelopment of nanoscale particles for controlled
targeted delivery of therapeutics, genes, or antibodies.\nd.\tMethods to
 enhance existing imaging technologies using magnetic properties at the
nanoscale.\ne.\tApplication of nanostructures (e.g. noble metal
nanoparticles, quantum dots, and nanolithographic structures that show
promise for diagnostic development) for identification and analysis of
genes, proteins, and other biological molecules implicated in the
actions of drugs of abuse. \n\tApplications are invited from any of the
above areas. Phase I should demonstrate convincingly the viability of
the proposed innovation, whereas Phase II should carry out the
development, characterization, testing, and screening of the innovation.

\n9.\tFunctional Genomics Resources and Strategies.  In the post-genomic
 era, an explosion of gene discovery studies utilizing strategies such
as genome-wide association scans, microarrays, and proteomics have
identified a host of genes\/gene variants associated with susceptibility
 to, or protection from, diseases of addiction. A critical next step is
to validate these candidate genes\/variants to determine which ones play
 an authentic functional role in mediating addiction. Functional
validation could occur at many different phenotypic levels ranging from
the molecular to the behavioral. Studies could investigate a few high
priority genes\/variants or could test several hundred genes\/variants
rapidly. The development of resources and strategies that would
facilitate functional validation of genes\/gene variants include (but
are not limited to) the following areas:\na.\tGene\/variant effects on
subcellular localization, stability, or function of mRNAs\/proteins
relevant to drug addiction.\nb.\tThe development of imaging and other
strategies to identify gene\/variant effects on neuronal or brain
functions relevant to addiction.\nc.\tStrategies to identify
gene\/variant effects on behavior, such as response to addictive
stimuli, stress, or changes in social situations.\nd.\tRNA
interference-mediated depletion of candidate genes in cells or whole
organisms to look for phenotypic alterations such as changes in synapse,
 dendritic spine, or cell morphology, gene expression, or behavioral
responses to drugs of abuse. \ne.\tStrategies exploiting the growing
collection of genetic mutants in candidate genes (particularly utilizing
 model organisms such as mouse, zebrafish, Drosophila, C. elegans or
yeast) to functionally validate genes\/variants. \nf.\tApproaches
enabling comparison of wild type protein function to the function of
allelic variants using in vivo transgenes or in vitro biochemical
assays, especially if these approaches reveal whether a variation
increases or decreases gene function.\ng.\tSystems-based approaches
investigating whether a set of candidate genes is co-expressed in a
particular brain region or cell type, physically interacts with one
another, or functions together in a signal transduction cascade are also
 of great interest. \nh.\tApproaches to ascribe drug abuse-related
function to genes\/variants in non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, gene
regulatory elements, gene copy number, or other putative non-protein

Development of new imaging techniques, reagents and related hardware and
 software for dynamic investigations of the effects of drugs of abuse on
 cellular activities and communications. For example, these techniques
might include, but are not limited to, development and utilization of
reagents for magnetic resonance microscopy and other MRI methods;
development of methodologies applying functional MRI to drug abuse
studies; the use of dyes, intrinsic signals, and other optical
indicators for studying signal transduction mechanisms, the regulatory

HIV\/AIDS infection. Materials and technologies may target a single
risk-level or may take a comprehensive approach encompassing audiences
at the universal, selective, and\/or indicated levels. Universal
interventions target the general population; selective target subgroups
of the population with defined risk factors for substance abuse;
indicated interventions target individuals who have detectable signs or

 Research Branch (ERB).  The ERB supports a research program on drug
abuse epidemiology that includes (1) studies of trends and patterns of
drug abuse and related conditions such as HIV\/AIDS in the general
population and among subpopulations, (2) studies of causal mechanisms
leading to onset, escalation, maintenance, and cessation of drug abuse
across stages of human development, (3) studies of

social consequences of drug abuse, (5) bio-epidemiologic studies
including genetic epidemiology studies, (6) methodological studies to
improve the design of epidemiologic studies and to develop innovative
statistical approaches, including modeling techniques.\n1.\tImprovement
of Reliability and Validity of Reporting of Sensitive Data.  The
reliability and validity of self-report of drug use and related
behaviors (e.g., HIV risk behavior) is a matter of great concern. Use of
 new technologies for real time data collection in ecological settings
is of great interest because these technologies enable collection of
drug consumption data in context. Studies to improve methodologies based
 on variations of standard survey protocols or computer-assisted
self-interview (CASI) and personal interview (CAPI) are also
encouraged.\n2.\tInstrument Development.  Easy-to-use assessment
instruments are needed to enhance epidemiology research. Areas of
interest include but are not limited to:\na.\tCommunity Assessment. The
development of community diagnostic instruments for psychometrically
sound assessment of community characteristics is essential to improve
our understanding of how community factors affect drug abuse and ensuing
 behavioral and social consequences. Standardized assessments of
community characteristics are needed to better understand the full
impact of drug use and to develop targeted interventions to specific
community needs.\nb.\tAssessment of Psychiatric Comorbidity in Community
 Settings. Easy to use, reliable, and valid instruments are needed to
assess psychiatric comorbidity in different populations of drug abusers,
 including adolescents and those in community drug abuse treatment
settings.\nc.\tAssessment Instruments to Measure CNS Function Related to
 Drug Abuse. The development of age-appropriate assessment instruments
to measure behavioral and cognitive function over the course of
development will contribute to our understanding of vulnerability to
drug abuse and functional impairment due to drug use.\n3.\tDevelopment
of State-of-the-Art Mechanisms for Epidemiological Research.  The
development of state-of-the-art mechanisms to facilitate the use of
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in community epidemiology studies
 (for example Community Epidemiology Work Groups) and other drug abuse
research is if great interest. There is a need for enhanced software and
 hardware for GIS interfaces, database management, visualization, and
innovative spatial analysis capabilities. The role of GIS in public
health management and practice continues to evolve. Application of this
technology is an important step towards better understanding drug abuse
issues and their inherent complexities. The ability to evaluate
geospatial information provides a unique perspective of public health
issues such as emerging and shifting epidemics, the utilization of
treatment services, and rapid assessment of the impact of incidents
ranging from natural disasters to bioterrorism. When used alongside more
 traditional epidemiological techniques, GIS provides epidemiologists
the ability to address new questions, refine, or enhance existing
analyses.\nBethany Deeds, Ph.D.\n301-402-1935\nEmail:

Individual differences in risk for drug addiction are often expressed in
 degree rather than kind, that is, as gradations along an underlying
continuum that stretches from unobservable variations in risk for
addiction to extreme and fully debilitating addiction severity.
Assessment instruments in use today for measuring drug addiction (i.e.,
compulsivity in seeking and using drugs despite harmful consequences)
have proven reliability and validity, but are of limited use for
evaluating individual differences in risk for drug addiction. Advances
in computerized adaptive testing methods, computer-assisted
technologies, and psychometrics, including item response theory, suggest
 that the capabilities now exist for the development of the next
generation in addiction assessment. New assessment instruments are
needed to detect meaningful variation between, within, and across
individuals over time that is scalable along the dimension of risk for
addiction; these instruments should allow for efficient assessment of
the risk construct with minimal burden for administration, training, and
 cost to the researcher, clinician, research participant, or patient;
and they should ultimately provide valid and reliable scores
corresponding to established diagnostic criteria for substance use
disorders.\nElizabeth Lambert, M.Sc.\n301-402-1933\nEmail:

Ecologic Momentary Assessment.  Ecologic Momentary Assessment (EMA)
includes the measurement of exposures and events in real time as they
occur, and in the natural environment where they occur, such as the
home, neighborhood, or workplace. EMA tools include portable
technologies for longitudinal data collection in the field, such as
mobile phone electronic diaries and PDAs, geopositioning devices, motion
 sensors, biosensors, environmental sensors, and audiovisual devices. In
 addiction and behavioral research, new EMA tools may enhance the
contextual and temporal resolution of exposures, and the biological or
behavioral processes presumed to occur in response. Specific challenges
to address in the implementation of EMA include optimizing the timing of
 measurement and data quality, establishing sensor validity and
reliability in different populations, reducing intensely longitudinal
data for statistical analysis, achieving user acceptability, and
safeguarding user privacy. Studies are encouraged that address these and
 other challenges to improve the validity and acceptability of EMA
tools.\nLouise Eideroff, Ph.D.\n301-451-8663\nEmail:

supports a program of research on the effectiveness of drug abuse
treatment with a focus on the quality, cost, access to, and

research foci include: (a) the effectiveness and cost-benefits and
cost-effectiveness of drug abuse treatment, (b) factors affecting
treatment access, utilization, and health and behavioral outcomes for
defined populations, (c) the effects of organization, financing, and
management of services on treatment outcomes, (d) drug abuse service
delivery systems and models, such as continuity of care, stages of

treatment services for HIV seropositive patients and for those at risk
of infection.\n1.\tDrug Abuse Treatment Economic Research.  This
initiative will support research to design and develop data systems for
financial management and economic analysis of treatment programs and
larger systems in new healthcare settings and managed care networks.
Managerial decision-making requires the implementation of sophisticated
data systems to facilitate routine budgeting processes, allocation of
resources, performance measurement, and pricing decisions. The focus is
on the needs of managers within the organization and managers outside of
 the organization. Data system development must be based on standard
cost behavior and profit analysis. Data systems must be designed with
correct cost concepts (accounting and economic) in order to permit cost
and pricing decisions to be developed for new treatment technologies and
 management of ongoing systems. In research settings, such an initiative
 is vital for the assessment of new technologies developed for transfer
to practice.\n2.\tDetermining the Costs of Implementing Evidence-Based
Practices (EBPs) and Other Technologies in Drug Abuse Treatment.
Research shows that new technologies or evidence-based practices (EBPs)
can improve drug treatment outcomes, and it has been asserted that
large-scale drug abuse treatment improvement requires systematic
implementation of proven practices, processes, and technologies. Often,
however, new drug treatment approaches are not adopted or sustained in
usual practice, even in programs that served as settings for research
showing their effectiveness. This may be due in part to a poor
understanding of the initial or ongoing costs entailed by new practices,
 processes, or technologies (hereafter referred to as technologies).
Methods and tools need to be developed and tested to help drug abuse
treatment service providers and payers arrive at realistic estimates of
the costs of implementing and sustaining new technologies in usual
practice settings. With regard to new technologies, implementing is
defined as an ongoing process of selecting, adopting, and adapting these
 new technologies into ongoing treatment, particularly with
consideration for the local setting, population and available resources.
 Sustaining is defined as an ongoing process of providing needed
resources (such as staffing, training, and equipment), maintaining the
quality of the new technology through evaluation, monitoring, and
improvement, and determining its ongoing utility compared to
alternatives. The tools and methodologies should be able to identify and
 estimate costs separately for implementing and for sustaining new
technologies, and should consider both clinical and administrative
technology. At a minimum, domains in which costs should be estimated
include assessment of programmatic need, appropriateness, and value;
staffing qualifications (salary and competencies); training, support,
equipment, and other infrastructure requirements; information \/ data
requirements; quality monitoring and improvement; and evaluation of
outcomes.\nSarah Duffy, Ph.D.\n301-443-6504\nEmail:
sduffy@nida.nih.gov\n3.\tPersonnel Selection Technology Research for
Drug Abuse Treatment Clinics. Research is showing that employee turnover
 is a substantial problem among substance abuse treatment services
providers. Applications supporting innovative research that develops and
 validates generic staff selection systems which could be adopted and
tailored for use by drug abuse treatment clinics are welcome. Like many
small businesses, drug abuse treatment clinics have problems attracting
and retaining qualified personnel. Also like many small businesses,
treatment clinics have limited resources to apply to the recruiting,
screening, and hiring of new and replacement personnel. Research has
shown that the application of standardized screening and selection
methods designed to maximize person-job fit can cost-effectively reduce
staff turnover. Systematic methods such as background inventories,
protocol-driven interviews, aptitude tests, and credit checks have
demonstrated validity for improving person-job fit. Examples of possible
 projects might include development of easy-to-understand guidance about
 legal considerations in hiring practices, software that transform job
task analysis into selection criteria, interview protocols to
standardize applicant screening, tolls to help improve recruitment,
and\/or self-paced training for hiring officials or interview panels to
improve screening reliability.\n4.\tCustomer Retention Technology.
Premature disengagement from drug abuse treatment participation is a
common problem and ranges from approximately 30 to 60% based upon the
clinic and modality studied. Past research has very frequently
attributed dropping out of treatment to participant characteristics
(e.g., motivation, addiction severity, comorbidity) and\/or
environmental factors (e.g., social pressures, unemployment,
homelessness). Seldom has the dropout problem been studied in the
context of customer satisfaction. That is, there is little research
looking at the causes of dropping out of treatment attributable to
organizational factors (e.g., policies, practices, context) that
influence participant withdrawal decisions. Needed are tools and systems
 for assessing and surveying drug abuse treatment program participant
perceptions and satisfaction levels, summarizing and report participant
assessments, interpreting results, and adjusting policies and practices
to improve satisfaction and participant retention in
treatment.\n5.\tEffective Management and Operation of Drug Abuse
Treatment Services Delivery.  The bulk of drug abuse treatment is
conducted in small clinical settings with therapeutic staffs of less
than a dozen people. Small clinics lack resources to help improve
efficiency and effectiveness in both business and therapeutic practices.
 Areas that may be of interest to small businesses include, but are not
limited to:\na.\tComputer-based leader\/manager self assessment tools:
On-line and other types of tools to help those supervising the delivery
of drug abuse treatment services to gain insights about personal
strengths and weaknesses, and to help guide them to improved leadership
and management practices.\nb.\tOrganizational change tools: Handbooks
describing step-by-step way to introduce more efficient business
practices such as quality management\/monitoring, creating empowered
work teams, formalized goal setting, improved customer relations,
forming organization linkages, and adopting new fiscal and resource
management techniques.\nc.\tOrganizational change tools: Handbooks
describing step-by-step ways to introduce more efficient or effective
therapeutic practices such as, adding pharmacotherapy in a previously
drug-free clinic, adopting new medical\/pharmacotherapy or behavioral
interventions, and adopting new approaches to clinical collaboration
and\/or case management.\n6.\tAssessment Tools for Quantifying and
Organizational Culture that Promotes and Sustains a Drug-Free Workforce.
  Though drug-free workplace programs are ubiquitous in large
businesses, small businesses often lack the staff and resources to
create effective drug-free programs because they may involve in-house or
 contract experts to educate, train, monitor, and enforce policies and
practices that will sustain a healthy workforce and a safe and healthy
workplace. Though there are numerous model drug-free workplace policies
and programs provided free by federal, state, and local governments as
well as nongovernmental organizations, many fail to provide management
with affordable or free, easy-to-use tools to assess the baseline of
their organizations\u2019 culture for drug abuse intolerance, and to
monitor progress in building a drug-free organizational culture.
Research shows that individual employees and organizations vary in their
 support for a drug-free workplace. Surveys indicate that coworker
tolerance for illicit drug use varies by the type of drug, the type of
industry, and the work role of the respondents. A drug-free culture
creates commonly-held attitudes, beliefs and practices among employees
that are socially reinforced. Once established, the need for costly
external incentives and other measures abates as coworkers socialize new
 incumbents and enforce behavior promoting abstinence. Tools and
methodologies need to be developed to a) assess an organization\u2019s
baseline culture for drug abuse intolerance both on and off the job, b)
identify policies and practices that undermine a drug-free culture, c)
enable the identification of programs, policies, and practices capable
of helping the workforce develop\/strengthen an organizational culture
of intolerance for drug use, and d) estimate the impact on the
organization\u2019s quality of work-life, job safety, individual and
group performance and productivity, and the profitability of the
organization itself. Included would be inexpensive and easy to use tools
 for monitoring workforce behavior change, and changes in the impact on
the organization (as outlined in \u201cd\u201d).\nThomas F. Hilton,

Technologies: Transporting Services Research to Practice.  This
initiative will support the development and testing of the effectiveness
 of web-based technologies that facilitate the translation of drug abuse
 prevention and treatment services research into practice. The ultimate
goal is the delivery of efficacious, low-cost interventions to the
greatest number of individuals in community settings. Delivery of
evidence-based services in community settings often is hampered by lack
of state-of-the-art information about the contents of efficacious
interventions, the organizational structures and processes that make
effective implementation possible, and available training and technical
assistance. Applications may include, but are not limited to, the
development and testing of new and innovative Internet-based systems
that provide practitioners with (a) current information on
evidence-based treatments with the greatest promise for defined
populations of drug abusers; (b) assistance in translating clinical
trials data into clinically useful information; (c) information and
training on how to effectively organize, manage, and deliver
evidence-based prevention and treatment services; (d) strategies for
organizational change and capacity building; and (e) access to training
and technical assistance on the adoption of new prevention and treatment
 interventions.\n8.\tNew Technologies for Screening, Assessing, and
Preventing Problem Drug Use and HIV, Matching Patients with Appropriate
Treatment Services.  Increased understanding of the complexities of
problem drug use and HIV risk behaviors has sparked growing interest in
and increased need for new user-friendly technologies to assist in the
screening, assessment, and prevention of drug abuse and HIV, and in the
matching of patients with appropriate treatment services. New
technologies, including CD-ROM, hand-held, Internet, videotape,
videodisc, and other electronic means have great potential for helping
treatment providers in specialty and non-specialty care settings
including primary care contexts to (a) screen for problem drug use and
associated health problems and risk behaviors, including HIV, (b) assess
 the nature and degree of drug use and HIV risk behaviors, (c) embed
items for screening or assessing problem drug use within existing
clinical tools, (d) deliver appropriate prevention interventions, and
(e) identify appropriate types and levels of treatment services for
patients based on their individual treatment needs. These new
technologies potentially can provide a more cost effective way of
identifying problem drug use, HIV risk behaviors and infection, and
associated health problems in a variety of health care settings,
speeding the assessment and treatment process, and improving treatment
placement decisions.\nDionne Jones, Ph.D.\n301-443-6504\nEmail:

Community.  Many offenders enter the criminal justice system with drug
abuse problems and related health issues. In addition to addressing
these health care issues within the prison walls, treatment programs are
 increasingly called upon to help offenders successfully reintegrate
into the community following incarceration. This often means helping
offenders to manage their recovery through monitoring, linkage with
continuing care services, development of social support networks, and
education of friends and family members about the nature of drug abuse
and the challenges facing the offender upon release from prison. It is
estimated that over the next several years, more than 600,000 criminal
justice offenders, many of whom have drug abuse problems, per year will
be released to return to their communities. New technologies are needed
to help treatment providers in the criminal justice system and in the
community coordinate efforts to effectively (a) monitor offenders\u2019
recovery once they have been released into the community, (b) prevent
relapse, (c) identify relapse early and efficiently re-engage released
offenders in appropriate treatment, (d) link released offenders with
continuing care services in the community, (e) develop social support
networks for recently released offenders in recovery, and (e) educate
offenders\u2019 family members so that they can more effectively support
 offenders in recovery once they have been released from prison.\nDionne

 Addiction Treatment Systems.  New technologies to support quality
improvement in community-based, addiction treatment provider systems are
 needed. Quality improvement methods, although well established in
business and healthcare management, are underutilized in addiction
treatment. Addiction treatment systems have limited resources for
initiating, developing, implementing, and sustaining quality improvement
 practices. Most community-based provider systems have limited capacity
to capture and integrate information about (a) the nature and extent of
community needs and resources; (b) organizational and management
processes to facilitate adoption, adaptation, implementation, and
sustained use of science-based innovations; (c) implementation costs for
 new service innovations; (d) client satisfaction; and (e) quality of
care. Centralized, automated and cost-efficient technological tools for
these purposes could help provider systems improve the quality and
efficiency of their treatment services, meet accreditation requirements,
 and reduce operating costs.\nBennett Fletcher,
Ph.D.\n301-443-6504\nEmail: bfletche@nida.nih.gov \n11.\tElectronic Drug
 Abuse Treatment Referral Systems for Physicians.  Research shows that
primary care physicians often do not screen for drug abuse disorders.
While this may be related to stigma attached to illicit drug use or to a
 lack of adequate health insurance, it may also be due to the lack of an
 adequate referral system that primary care physicians can use for the
patients they identify as having a potential drug problem. The lack of a
 referral system places a greater burden on the physician to secure
treatment resources for the patient, and also places the physician at
greater risk if no appropriate treatment can be found. A practical and
usable electronic drug abuse treatment referral system needs to be
developed and tested for use by physicians in primary care settings,
including doctor\u2019s offices. To be effective and useful, the system
needs to be targeted at local needs, for example by taking into account
local private insurance coverage and the types of insurance accepted by
local treatment providers. It should also include an actively-maintained
 database of local providers, with information on insurance carrier,
geographic \u201ccatchment\u201d area of treatment providers, types of
substance disorders treated, types of co-occurring disorders (mental
disorders, etc.) treated, gender, age, other pertinent treatment factors
 needed by primary care physicians to make appropriate referrals. The
system should be designed to be reliable and efficient, allowing for
appointment scheduling or other needed arrangements to ensure a
successful referral. Feasibility and cost-efficiency should be carefully
 considered.\nRichard Denisco, M.D.\n301-443-6504\nEmail:

Scudder\n301-443-6697\nEmail: scudderq@nida.nih.gov\nSpecific projects
could include:\n1.\tDevelopment of Combination Medication for Emergency
Treatment of Opioid Overdose in the Presence of Benzodiazepines.
Suspected opioid overdose\u2014coma, apnea and pin point pupil\u2014is
treated by the administration of naloxone, which, while effective, is
short-lived. Patients often leave the Emergency Room, return immediately
 to opioid use, and suffer dire consequences as a result. There is
sufficient preclinical and clinical evidence that buprenorphine may be a
 more effective medication for treatment of opioid overdose in such
patients. However, the clinical development of this treatment strategy
has been hampered by concerns that many opioid abusers also abuse
benzodiazepine, and in such patients the administration of buprenorphine
 may be hazardous. Fumazinil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist used
to treat benzodiazepine overdose, can be co-administered with
buprenorphine and may protect such patients from the ill effects of
buprenorphine in cases of overdose involving both opioids and
benzodiazepine. The goal is to develop and test the
buprenorphine-fumazinil combination medication formulation for the
treatment of opioid overdose with suspected concurrent benzodiazepine
abuse. \n2.\tScreening and Development of Partial Agonists at the Human
CB1 Receptor for Treatment of Marijuana Dependence or Withdrawal.  NIDA
seeks applications to screen and\/or develop CB1-receptor partial
agonists for application in the pharmacotherapeutic treatment of
marijuana dependence or withdrawal. The potential benefits of
CB1-receptor partial agonists in the treatment of dependence may
parallel those of safe and effective nicotine or opiate partial-agonist
replacement therapies, where buprenorphine and varenicline have
demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing abstinence from opioid use and
cigarette smoking, respectively. As implied by the designations of
partial-agonist replacement or substitution therapy, a partial-agonist
medication has core biological effects similar to those of the abused
drug. Importantly however, there is a ceiling-effect dose with the
administration of partial agonists not present with full agonists such
that at high doses, partial agonists are less likely to precipitate
adverse behavioral or biological events and to have abuse liability
compared to full agonists. The phase I project should identify compounds
 that bind to human CB1-receptors as partial agonists and, in the phase
II, the grantee should develop and evaluate selected partial
agonists.\n3.\tImproved Device to Capture and Measure Drug Use in Oral
Fluid.  Oral fluid (OF) testing is a promising method to monitor for
drugs of abuse. The main advantages of OF is the simplicity and
noninvasiveness of sample collection. Aside of patient\u2019s\/ study
participant\u2019s comfort and preference compared to urine drug screen,
 the oral fluid sample collection can be easily observed, obviating the
need for special restroom facilities and same-sex collectors and making
adulteration of the specimen more difficult. Furthermore, infection risk
 is lower than for drawing blood. For clinical toxicology applications,
including use in clinical trials, drug treatment programs, physician
office and emergency room testing, onsite OF testing would offer rapid
availability of results for diagnostic or research purposes. At this
point, however, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration approval of OF testing has been delayed because of
questions about drug device performance, disposition of drugs in OF, and
 need for improvement of assays. The greatest current limitation for OF
testing is the small number of controlled drug administration studies
available to inform interpretation of OF tests. (Bosker, Huestis, 2009)
Applications should address current limitations and present methods to
remove obstacles for wider usage of OF testing in clinical practice and
research.\n\tReference: Bosker WM, Huestis MA. Oral Fluid Testing for
Drugs of Abuse. Clinical Chemistry.2009; 55:11 1910-1931\n4.\tImproved
Technology of Testing Devices to Remotely Capture and Measure Drug Use
in Biological Specimens.  There is an ongoing need for more accurate,
practical and convenient point-of-collection testing devices for
monitoring drugs of abuse. Current devices that test for illicit drugs
in urine, oral fluid (saliva), sweat and hair have strengths and
limitations. The goal of this solicitation is to develop new
technologies\/devices that will increase strengths (e.g. accuracy,
practicality, and convenience) and decrease limitations (e.g. minimum
frequency, contamination, and adulteration) of testing methodologies.
New technology might permit testing from remote locations (e.g.
patient\u2019s or subject\u2019s home) while ensuring real time data
collection and transfer into medical records\/study databases. Risk of
adulteration should be minimized to a level comparable with tests
provided in drug treatment centers or study sites. The phase I
application should explore all tests currently available, especially new
 technologies allowing for remote collection of the data. In phase II,
the grantee should develop and test a prototype.\n5.\t\tNew
Technologies: Integrating Data from Prescription Monitoring Program(s)
to Current Clinical Practice.  In some states the prescription
monitoring program collects prescription data for controlled substances
into a central database that can then be used by a limited number of
authorized users to assist in deterring the illegitimate use of
prescription drugs. Prescribers and dispensers in some states may query
the database to assist in determining treatment history and to rule out
the possibility that a patient is "doctor shopping" or "scamming" to
obtain controlled substances. Limited time\/resources of busy medical
offices are a barrier to obtaining and utilizing this information to
improve quality of treatment for each individual patient. This
initiative will support development and testing of the effectiveness of
new technologies that facilitate utilization of data collected by
Prescription Monitoring Program(s) in clinical practice. Applications
may include, but are not limited to, the development and testing of new
and innovative Internet-based systems that provide a) practitioners with
 current information of their patients\u2019 treatment\/medication
compliance; and b) transfers data automatically to patients chart, etc.
The goal is to minimize barriers faced by clinical staff to obtain,
record and utilize the data while maintaining strict security
requirements (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability). These
 new technologies should provide a more cost effective way of
identifying treatment non-compliance and help adjust a treatment plan
according to the needs of individual patients as well as decrease
potential diversion of controlled substances. The phase I application
will explore and describe current Prescription Monitoring Programs and
new technologies allowing development and testing of the application in
phase II.\nDivision of Pharmacotherapies &amp; Medical Consequences of
Drug Abuse \nThe NIDA Division of Pharmacotherapies &amp; Medical
Consequences of Drug Abuse (DPMCDA) supports research aimed at the
development and testing of pharmacological and behavioral treatments for
 drug abuse and addiction. This includes the identification, evaluation,
 development, approvability, and efficacy testing of new and improved
pharmacotherapeutic agents, as well as the testing of marketed
medications, and of behavioral treatments used alone or integrated with
medications. \nA.\tChemistry and Pharmaceutics Branch (CPB).
\n1.\tSynthesis (either using traditional or combinatorial techniques)
or discovery (natural products) of new chemical compounds that would
have potential as treatment agents for the medical management of
stimulant (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine, or nicotine) addiction.
Consideration should be given to the design of partial agonists or pure
antagonists that diminish the reinforcing effects of stimulants, as well
 as full agonists that could function to normalize physiological
activity following discontinuation of stimulant use. The CPB supports
research in the design (including molecular modeling and
structure-activity relationship studies) and synthesis of novel
compounds, formulation development, bioanalytical methods development,
and pharmacokinetics\/ pharmacodynamics aimed at the discovery and
development of new medications for treating drug addiction. Areas that
may be of interest to small businesses include, but are not limited to
research related to the design and development of new compounds and
improved drug products (drug delivery) for the treatment of drug
addiction.\n2.\tCompounds of interest include those that are designed to
 affect dopaminergic (i.e., D1 agonists, D3 agonists and D3 antagonists)
 activity, CRF antagonists, compounds affecting glutamate activity,
GABAergic activity, small molecule neuropeptide antagonists and
compounds acting through other mechanisms for which justification has
been supplied.\n3.\tSynthesis (either using traditional or combinatorial
 techniques) of new chemical compounds that would have potential as
treatment agents for the medical management of cannabinoid
abuse.\n4.\tDevelopment of new immunotherapeutic treatments that would
have the potential as treatment agents for stimulant or cannabinoid
abuse.\n5.\tDevelopment of heroin\/morphine-protein conjugates
(heroin\/morphine conjugate vaccines) for the treatment of
heroin\/opiate addiction.\nRichard Kline, Ph.D.\n301-443-8293\nEmail:
rk108@nih.gov \n6.\tDevelopment of new approaches for the administration
 of potential addiction treatment drugs (including small molecules,
natural products, peptides, proteins, antibodies, etc.) with poor
bioavailability.\n7.\tDevelopment of controlled release dosage forms for
 addiction treatment medications in order to maintain therapeutic drug
levels for extended periods of time to alleviate compliance problems
associated with addiction treatment.\n8.\tDevelopment of novel dosage
forms or chemical\/pharmaceutical approaches that eliminate or
significantly reduce the abuse potential of prescription drugs\/drug
products.\n9.\tDevelopment of novel technologies and strategies to
deliver potential therapeutic agents (including small molecules and
peptides) across blood brain barrier for the treatment of drug
addiction.\nMoo Park, Ph.D.\n301-443-5280\nEmail:
mp264a@nih.gov\nB.\tMedications Discovery and Toxicology Branch (MDTB).
 The MDTB supports research on the development of preclinical behavioral
 models (e.g., of craving, drug-seeking behavior, dependence, or
relapse), biochemical assays, gene expressional assays and
electrophysiological methods to identify and characterize new
medications to treat substance abuse, as well as pharmacological
screening of novel compounds to identify potential drug abuse
medications. The Branch also supports research on toxicity studies of
potential medications for the treatment of substance abuse, and
interactions of potential treatment medications with abused substances.
Areas that may be of interest to small businesses include, but are not
limited to development of new methods for discovery of medications
useful in treating drug addiction. Of special interest would be the
development of new animal models of addiction, incorporating established
 drug self-administration techniques that show increased relevance to
the clinical setting. Development of relevant biochemical or
electrophysiological screening methods is also encouraged.\nJane B.

Research Grants Branch (MRGB).\n1.\tDevelop Novel Treatments for SRDs.
The MRGB seeks to support the development of novel pharmacotherapeutic-
and immunological treatments for persons with substance-related
disorders (SRDs). The Branch also supports projects aimed at
incorporating technological advances that could be used to more
effectively treat SRDs.\n\tThis solicitation aims to support small
business development of compounds that have completed (or are nearing
completion of) successful preclinical evaluation. Treatments should aim
to help subjects reduce drug use, become drug free, prolong
abstinence\/reduce craving, or facilitate survival from drug overdose.
\n\tTherapies that small businesses might consider evaluating include,
but are not limited to:\n\u2022\tA novel (e.g., new chemical entity,
novel drug formulation) that could be used to treat SRDs \n\u2022\tA
marketed compound (e.g., SSRIs, anti-epileptic drugs) that could be used
 to treat SRDs \n\u2022\tVaccines for substances of abuse (e.g.,
cocaine, nicotine)\n\u2022\tMonoclonal antibodies for substances of
abuse (e.g., methamphetamine, PCP)\n\u2022\tNaturally-occurring
compounds (e.g., dietary supplements) that could be used to treat SRDs
\n\u2022\tOr, a rationalized poly-therapeutic combination of
pharmacotherapies designed to more comprehensively treat
SRDs\n\tTreatments that concurrently help alleviate associated
psychiatric co-morbidities (e.g., depression, schizophrenia, PTSD,
anxiety, etc.) and\/or are focused upon underserved\/vulnerable
populations (e.g., pregnant women and their fetuses, adolescents, racial
 or ethnic minorities, women\/gender issues, subjects within the
criminal justice system) are especially encouraged.\t\n2.\tDevelopment
of a Test\/Device to More Effectively Diagnose\/Manage Patients with
SRDs.  This solicitation aims to support the identification and
development of an innovative test\/device that can be used to help more
effectively diagnose and\/or manage patients with SRDs. The use of this
novel diagnostic tool might help to: (1) expedite the development of-,
and\/or (2) enhance existing treatments for patients with SRDs.
\n\tPossible diagnostic tests\/devices that a small business might
consider, but are not limited to, include: \n\u2022\t An assay\/device
(e.g., skin sensors, oral swabs) that detects a substance of abuse more
reliably than oft-used urinalysis. Optimally, the analytical
test\/device would be non-invasive and easy-to-use, such that it could
be used on an outpatient basis. \n\u2022\tDiscovery\/development of a
diagnostic test\/screen that could help physicians more effectively
manage treatments for patients with SRDs.\t\n3.\tDiscovery \/
Development of Biomarkers Related to SRD Treatment Outcomes.  Because
drug addiction is a brain disease which can change the structure and
function of the brain, there is a unique opportunity to develop
biomarkers that could reliably predict\/assess SRD treatment outcome. To
 date, evaluations of SRDs often utilize subjective measures (e.g.,
patient-reported questionnaires) to assess disease progression and
primary treatment outcomes. Biomarkers represent a more objective
measure of physiological functioning that can be used to predict,
diagnose, evaluate the progression of, and\/or more accurately assess
overall treatment safety and effectiveness.\n\tThe goal of this
initiative is to support the small business discovery\/development of
reproducible, quantitative biomarkers related to SRD treatment outcomes.
 Potential biomarkers might be derived from underlying variations in
DNA, gene expression, proteins, metabolism, and\/or neuroimages, among
others.\t\n4.\tCreation of a Data Repository\/Software Tool for
SRD-related Clinical Research Data.  Clinical data management is
currently heterogeneous. Different investigators use different
nomenclatures, definitions, timeframes, data-collection instruments,
data analysis and reporting methods. This varied (and often inadequate)
data management system severely limits the interpretation of results
from clinical trials and complicates the ability to make data-based
decisions concerning the overall effectiveness of a therapeutic
intervention. Appropriate collection and standardization of clinical
trial data should permit, for example, more statistically-valid
comparisons of treatment outcomes and data integration, meta-analysis,
and aid in the development of more effective, individualized clinical
treatments for patients with SRDs. \n\tThe purpose of this initiative is
 to support small business development of repository\/software tool that
 can be used to more efficiently capture and manage (i.e.,
facilitate\/standardize collection, storage, screen\/analyze, report)
data obtained from NIDA-funded clinical trials. Collection\/storage of
these data should follow HIPAA guidelines
(http:\/\/www.hhs.gov\/ocr\/privacy\/index.html) to guarantee the
privacy and confidentiality of all study participants.\nKristopher
Bough, Ph.D.\n301-443-9800\nEmail: boughk@mail.nih.gov\nDivision of
Clinical Neuroscience and Behavioral Research (DCNBR)\nA.\tBehavioral
and Integrative Treatment Branch.  The Behavioral and Integrative
Treatment Branch is interested in research on behavioral and integrative
 treatments for drug abuse and addiction. The term "behavioral
treatments" is used in a broad sense and includes various forms of
psychotherapy, behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, family therapy,
couples and marital therapy, group therapy, skills training, meditation,
 guided imagery, counseling, and rehabilitative therapies. The term,
\u201cIntegrative treatments\u201d refers to treatments that combine
behavioral interventions with other treatments, including other
behavioral therapies, medications, and\/or complementary\/alternative
therapies. Behavioral and integrative treatment research has been
conceptualized to consist of three stages. Stage I, or early treatment
development, involves research on the development, refinement, and pilot
 testing of behavioral and integrative interventions. Stage I may
include translational research that incorporates concepts, methods or
findings from other disciplines (e.g., neuroscience, cognitive science,
etc.) into the development of behavioral and integrative treatments.
Stage I may also include research to develop or adapt treatments to
become more \u201ccommunity-friendly.\u201d Stage II includes testing
treatments that show promise and testing the \u201cdose-response\u201d
of treatments. Stage III is research aimed at determining if and how
efficacious behavioral treatments may be transported to community
settings. Stage III may include studies that test treatments in
community settings, with community therapists. Stage III may also
include studies that develop or test methods of training treatment
providers to administer treatments. Determination of mechanism of action
 of treatment is relevant to all three stages. Specific areas of
interest include:\n1.\tTranslation from Basic Behavioral or Cognitive
Science.  \u201cStage I\u201d research on the development of behavioral
therapies or components of such therapies that are based on developments
 and findings from the basic behavioral or cognitive
sciences.\n2.\tTranslation of Cognitive, Affective and Social
Neuroscience Findings Towards Development of Behavioral Treatments.
\u201cStage I\u201d research on the development of behavioral treatments
 or components of such therapies that are based on developments and
findings from cognitive, affective, or social neuroscience. For example,
 one may wish to apply findings on the neural underpinnings of
adolescent risk-taking behaviors to target the developmental needs of
substance using youth, or apply findings on the link between early
adversity and the impairment of emotion regulatory abilities to address
the needs of substance using victims of childhood abuse.\n3.\tTreatment
of Sleep Disorders for Individuals in Drug Abuse Treatment.  Recent
research on sleep has shed new light on its importance to psychological
and physical health. Sleep deprivation has been linked with impaired
cognitive performance, negative mood, and even decreased immune
function. Drug abusers often cite insomnia as reason for relapse, and
may use drugs to modulate their sleep\/waking cycles. However, the
treatment of sleep disorders has not been a primary focus of drug abuse
treatment research. The development and testing of sleep hygiene
interventions, alone or in combination with behavioral interventions,
for use in conjunction with drug abuse treatment, as a means of
improving treatment for drug abuse is needed. Developmentally and age
appropriate, as well as gender sensitive treatment of sleep disorders
could impact on the development of more effective treatment
interventions.\nLisa Onken, Ph.D.\n301-443-2235\nEmail:
l010n@nih.gov\n4.\tModifying Efficacious Behavioral Treatments to be
Community Friendly.  Several behavioral interventions have been found to
 be efficacious for the treatment of drug addiction. However, there are
barriers to implementation of behavioral treatments in community-based
settings. Community settings that treat drug addicted individuals are
reluctant or unwilling to adopt these interventions for a variety of
reasons. Reasons that scientifically-based behavioral treatments are not
 accepted by community providers could include the excessive cost of
implementation, the length of time for administration of treatment,
inadequate training available for therapists and counselors, treatments
not shown to be generalizable for different patient populations or for
polydrug abusing populations, etc. Research aimed at modifying
efficacious behavioral treatments to make them more acceptable to
community settings is needed. Settings might include, drug abuse
treatment facilities, primary care, managed care, after-school or
classroom settings, colleges, and the criminal and juvenile justice
system. Examples of possible studies are those that are designed to
reduce the cost of treatments, reduce the time of administration of
treatments, aid in training of therapists, counselors and nurses, adapt
individual therapies for group situations, etc.\n5.\tTreatments to
Prevent Escalation from Abuse to Dependence.  Therapies for drug abusers
 who are not yet dependent on drugs to reduce risk of escalation to
dependence and therapies for drug abusers who have not considered or
claim little interest in seeking treatment for their drug problems are
needed. Treatments for participants in their natural environment, such
as treatments delivered over the Internet, cell phone, or in
neighborhood settings such as churches and recreation centers are
desired. A particular focus on treatments which incorporate engagement
strategies for hard to interest groups are requested. Educational games,
 interactive video content, fluency based learning approaches and other
methods to help maintain involvement are encouraged.\n6.\tVirtual
Reality Applications for Drug Abuse.  Development and improvement of
treatments using Virtual Reality and other new simulation technologies
is needed. New technology may help to make existing treatments more
effective, or may make novel treatments possible. Behavioral treatment
research to develop, modify, adapt, and test treatments for drug abuse
and for co-morbid psychiatric conditions (such as anxiety disorders)
using new technologies is of interest.\n\tRecently virtual reality
simulations have been used to train medical personnel in demanding
medical procedures such as microsurgery techniques. Virtual training
allows trainees to gain familiarity with both the environment in which
services are delivered as well as the intervention techniques without
the danger of mistakes impacting live patients. Virtual reality
interfaces can assess skill acquisition and provide detailed feedback
during procedures to help trainees correct mistakes or avoid making them
 altogether. In the drug abuse field, training and dissemination efforts
 have been hampered by a dearth of knowledge about ways to conduct
dissemination. Although trainees often practice on actual clients, this
approach has drawbacks including its reliance on the client or
participant\u2019s schedule and willingness to participate in training
sessions and potential danger to the client or if the intervention is
delivered incorrectly. Libraries of virtual reality simulations of drug
users in treatment or \u201cvirtual patients\u201d are needed to provide
 experiential training for treatment providers without relying on
existing patients. This will help facilitate the rapid and effective
dissemination of proven treatment strategies.\n7.\tVirtual Clinical
Trials Settings for Conducting Behavioral Treatment Trials and
Addictions Treatment Provider Education Trials in Cyberspace.  Virtual
communities such as Second Life as well as private web forums offer a
unique opportunity for behavioral therapy researchers and providers to
establish and conduct online psychotherapy and behavioral therapy
development research as well as a forum to develop provider
\u201cuniversity\u2019s\u201d at which various training techniques may
be tested for discovering the most efficacious way to deliver continuing
 education and other training in the latest methods of treating
addiction. Applications are encouraged to develop such a forum and test
either a provider training or behavioral therapy method in an online
trial. As part of this research platform, methods for obtaining consent,
 maintaining confidentiality, collecting data and where needed,
assessing provider adherence and competence are expected. \n8.\tRemote
and\/or Mobile Abstinence and Identity Verification.  Methods are needed
 for at home or mobile abstinence verification which include identity
verification. Drug abuse treatment researchers are in the process of
developing web-based and mobile phone based treatments which can extend
treatment beyond the clinic walls. Additionally, there is growing
recognition by providers that drug addiction is a chronic disease which
may require multiple bouts of treatment. However, currently there are no
 means of monitoring abstinence once patients leave formal treatment or
validating progress of patients undergoing treatment located outside a
clinic which provides onsite testing. Monitoring onsite testing poses
barriers to patient privacy but unobserved sample donation may be
subject to switching and adulterants. Products are needed which both
test for the presence of illicit substances and which accurately
identify the donor of the sample and the time of its submission so
patients can participate in monitoring outside of formal treatment
settings. Blood sampling similar in invasiveness to a skin prick for
diabetes testing or other low risk sampling of other tissues and
specimens may be acceptable. Scalability and automation of methods are
particularly desirable.\nCecelia Spitznas, Ph.D.\n301-443-0107, Fax:

Medications and Treatment for Drug Abusers with HIV\/AIDS.  The
introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has
significantly changed HIV\/AIDS clinical care. There is a need for
research related to the development and testing of new and improved
behavioral interventions(alone, and in combination with pharmacological
treatments for drug addiction), in order to facilitate better adherence
to antiviral regimens among drug abusers with HIV infection, including
HIV positive drug abusers with comorbid medical illnesses and\/or
psychiatric disorders. There is also a need to develop and test
adherence interventions administered or assisted by technological
devices such as computers, the internet, expert system models, telephone
 pagers, or hand-held computers. \n10.\tTreatment for Emerging or
Specific Populations.  Therapies designed to intervene with understudied
 populations including users of drugs such as methamphetamine, MDMA and
other club drugs, marijuana, inhalants, and prescription opioids and
psychostimulants, as well as children of substance abusers in need of
treatment, and drug abusers with comorbid psychiatric disorders and\/or
medical illnesses such as HIV\/AIDS, hepatitis, etc.\n11.\tDevelopment
of HIV Risk Reduction Interventions.  Research to develop and evaluate
behavioral strategies to reduce HIV risk behaviors in HIV-positive and
HIV-negative substance abusing treatment populations. Where appropriate,
 risk reduction interventions should be adapted to patients\u2019 age,
gender, cultural background and potential cognitive impairments, and
should address compliance with medical regimens. The product of such
research might be training, supervision, or educational materials, such
as manuals or videotapes that describe the intervention and its
implementation by treatment staff.\n12.\tWoman and Gender Differences in
 the Provision of Behavioral Treatments, and HIV\/AIDS Risk Reduction
Approaches.  Develop and evaluate specific behavioral treatment
approaches targeting drug-addicted women. This may include behavioral
therapies, skills training techniques, counseling strategies, and HIV
and other infectious disease behavioral risk reduction strategies. This
may also include development and testing of training materials that
specifically address women and gender differences in drug addiction
treatment to promote effective use of research-based treatment
approaches. Training materials may involve treatment manuals, training
videos, CD ROM or DVD technologies, Internet or computer based programs
to manage aspects of treatment administration, or other innovative
educational strategies for health professionals using new
technologies.\n13.\tBehavioral Treatments Drawing from Stress Research
or Stress-Management Interventions.  Projects are encouraged that apply
concepts from stress research (such as appraisal, coping, and social
support) to drug abuse in innovative ways, or that test the extent to
which stress-management interventions can be applied to the treatment of
 drug abuse and interventions to reduce risk of HIV and other infectious
 diseases. Examples of stress-management techniques that may have novel
application to drug abuse and HIV risk include techniques that teach
problem-solving and affect-management, restore one\u2019s sense of
purpose and meaning, prevent burnout in the face of chronic stressors,
increase self-efficacy for managing stress, inoculate against stressors,
 train relaxation and meditation, intervene during crises, enlist social
 support and system support, and others.\n14.\tBehavioral Strategies for
 Increasing Medication Adherence.  Research to develop and to evaluate
strategies to induce recovering addicts to take medication for a
prolonged time, especially opioid antagonist naltrexone; partial
opioid-agonist buprenorphine, etc. to encourage HIV infected drug users
to comply with medical treatments (HAART) in drug abuse treatment
settings; or to adapt existing behavioral strategies to increase patient
 compliance and cooperation in long-term treatment for drug abuse or for
 diseases associated with drug abuse such as tuberculosis or hepatitis.
An important consideration should be cost and practicality of use in
actual clinical practice or in an aftercare program. The product of such
 research might be a manual, which describes the behavioral strategy,
and its implementation by treatment staff or scientific data regarding
evaluation.\nShoshana Kahana, Ph.D.\n301-443-2261, Fax:
301-443-6814\nEmail: kahanas@mail.nih.gov\n15.\tIntegration of
Behavioral Treatments and Pharmacotherapies.  Development of integrated
behavioral treatments and pharmacotherapies may enhance the efficacy of
both types of therapeutic interventions. For instance, the maintenance
and detoxification of heroin addicts could perhaps be optimized by the
integration of distinctive behavioral treatments devised specifically
for opioid agonists, antagonists or partial agonists determined by the
heterogeneity of the subgroup of addicts and the pharmacological
differences of the medications. Integration of medications and
behavioral treatments could possibly enhance compliance with medication
regimens, increase retention allowing pharmacological effects to occur
and prevent relapse to drug abuse and addiction.\n16.\tBehavioral
Treatment Research for Drug Abuse and Addiction in Primary Care.  Recent
 research has shown that physicians and other clinicians often fail to
recognize drug abuse or addiction among their primary care patients. In
addition, a significant number of these clinicians reported that they
did not know how to intervene with their patients if drug abuse or
addiction was suspected. Drug abuse related illnesses and morbidity
often occur in adults and may have begun in adolescence. However, very
little research has been done to develop or test behavioral treatment
approaches or combined pharmacological and behavioral treatments for
drug abuse and addiction in primary care settings. The objectives of
this initiative are to encourage research on the development and testing
 of innovative behavioral treatment approaches e.g. screening and brief
interventions, use of web-based or mobile technologies used alone or in
combination with pharmacological treatments. Other goals of this
research initiative are to encourage additional research on the
development and validation of culturally sensitive screening and
assessment instruments for use with youth and adults in primary care;
and to encourage research on the transportability of efficacious
behavioral treatments to primary care settings, as well as research on
science-based training approaches for changing primary care clinicians'
behaviors regarding their recognition and intervention with drug abusing
 or addicted patients. While motivational enhancement approaches for
some drug abusing populations have been found to be effective, this
behavioral approach has not been widely used in primary
care.\n17.\tUsing Telemedicine to Deliver Efficacious Treatment to
Underserved Populations in Specialty Addictions Treatment and\/or
General Medical Settings.  Telemedicine programs are being used in urban
 medical centers to rapidly disseminate science-based information on new
 medical treatments. In addition, approximately one-third of the rural
hospitals are now using telemedicine to improve patient care Studies are
 needed to modify existing treatments developed by NIDA researchers for
deployment and testing as telemedicine treatments at remote locations to
 underserved populations. These may be delivered in any patient care
context including primary care or specialty addiction treatment.
Modification of the treatment content to apply to the remote patient
population and provider training materials to orient the onsite staff
who may not be experienced at delivering the new treatment may be
needed.\n18.\tYouth Smoking Cessation.  Smoking related illnesses
usually occur in adults. However, tobacco use and nicotine addiction
generally begin in childhood or adolescence. Despite health warnings,
adolescents continue to initiate smoking at alarming rates and the
majority will continue to smoke as adults. Adolescents who begin to
smoke, develop nicotine dependence very quickly and exhibit withdrawal
symptoms during quit attempts in a similar fashion to adults. Most
adolescents who smoke, express a desire to quite. To date, research on
smoking cessation for teen and young adult smokers has not been
particularly fruitful. This initiative requests research aimed at the
development and testing of smoking cessation treatments tailored to the
specific needs of adolescents and young adults. Consideration should
also be given to gender and ethnicity.\n19.\tComplementary and
Alternative Medicine Therapies (CAM) for Drug Abuse Treatment.  Research
 is encouraged on complementary and alternative interventions for drug
abuse treatment either as the sole treatment or as an adjunct to enhance
 the therapeutic potency of existing drug abuse treatments. Any of the
five CAM categories: Whole medical systems, mind-body interventions,
biologically-based therapies, Manipulative\/body-based therapies and
energy therapies would be considered for this initiative (for more
information, see http:\/\/nccam.nih.gov\/). CAM therapies are
interventions that are commonly used in \u201creal world\u201d settings,
 but whose therapeutic efficacy has not been scientifically
demonstrated. The product of this research might also be a manual or
video, which illustrates the intervention and how it is implemented by
treatment staff.\nGeetha Subramaniam, M.D.\n301-435-0974\nEmail:
geetha.subramaniam@nih.gov\n20.\tDeveloping, Evaluating, and
Transporting Culturally Sensitive Behavioral Treatments for Racial and
Ethnic Minorities.  Minority populations are disproportionately affected
 by the consequences of drug abuse. Research to develop and evaluate
behavioral treatments that are culturally sensitive and relevant for
diverse racial and ethnic minority populations is encouraged. This may
include studies of behavioral treatments, alone or in combination with
pharmacological treatment, or studies of behavioral strategies for
increasing adherence to taking medications. In the development and
evaluation of the behavioral treatment, attention needs to be directed
at examining medical, social, and cultural factors that may influence
adherence to the behavioral treatment approach and treatment outcome.
Also, little is known about the transportability of efficacious
behavioral treatments for minority populations. Research is needed on
how to transport science-based treatments to various racial\/ethnic
populations.\n21.\tIncorporating Smoking Cessation in Drug Abuse
Treatment.  Research is encouraged to develop and test behavioral and
combined behavioral and pharmacological treatments for nicotine-addicted
 individuals who also are addicted to other substances, such as heroin,
cocaine, methamphetamines and alcohol. Prevalence of cigarette smoking
is extremely high among drug dependent individuals attending drug
treatment. Many treatment providers are reluctant to address smoking
cessation with clients either because they believe that substance
abusers are not interested in quitting or because they fear smoking
treatment will have a negative impact on drug abuse treatment outcome.
However, studies have shown that many drug abuse clients are interested
in quitting smoking and that the concurrent treatment of tobacco
dependence and other drug dependencies does not threaten abstinence and
might even assist in maintaining it. Research is needed to develop and
test smoking cessation treatments that can be incorporated into
treatments for illicit drugs of abuse.\n22.\tDeveloping Treatments for
Smokers with Comorbid Disorders.  Research is encouraged that focuses on
 the development, refinement, and testing of behavioral treatments for
smokers with psychiatric comorbidity, such as depression, schizophrenia,
 or anxiety disorders. Smoking prevalence is very high in individuals
with psychiatric disorders. These populations generally respond poorly
to traditional smoking cessation treatments. Similarly, medical
comorbidities are widely prevalent and are in need of additional
research in adults and in special populations such as youth, LGBT and
homeless persons. Research is needed to develop and test innovative
behavioral and combined behavioral and pharmacological treatments that
address the unique needs of these individuals.\n23.\tTobacco Cessation
for Pregnant and Post-Partum Women.  Smoking among pregnant women
remains an ongoing public health concern. It is estimated that
approximately 20-30% of pregnant women smoke. Maternal smoking during
pregnancy has been linked to infant mortality, impaired fetal brain and
nervous system development, premature and complicated births, and low
birth-weight babies. For women who do quit during pregnancy, relapse
rates vary, but are reported as approximately 25% before delivery, 50%
within four months postpartum, and 70-90% by one year postpartum.
Children of smokers continue to be at risk for respiratory illness,
middle ear infections, impaired lung function, and Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome. Sustained tobacco cessation during pregnancy and the
postpartum period reduces health risks to both mothers and their babies.
 Research focused on the development of innovative behavioral and
combined behavioral and pharmacological interventions for
nicotine-addicted pregnant and postpartum women is encouraged.
Interventions may be tailored to sub-populations of pregnant smokers,
such as teenage girls, heavy smokers, ethnic minorities, or low SES
populations. Examples of other potential studies may include the
development of smoking cessation interventions that address co-occurring
 issues, such as depression or weight-gain, interventions that include
partners or support persons, Internet-based interventions or
interventions that can be delivered by primary care
physicians.\n24\tBehavioral Treatments for Groups.  This includes the
development of new psychotherapy approaches, the modification or testing
 of existing behavioral treatments, and the design and\/or testing of
innovative clinical training and supervision methods for dissemination
of efficacious treatments to community settings. Examples of relevant
projects are: traditional group therapies, such as 12-step and
therapeutic community approaches, and newer group therapies such as
cognitive-behavioral and acceptance-oriented approaches; groups for
various populations, such as adolescents, adults, couple and family
groups, gender-specific groups, and groups tailored for racial or ethnic
 minority populations. Of particular interest are projects that address
the recent reports suggesting possible contraindications of group
treatments for some populations (e.g., delinquent adolescents), or in
some formats (e.g., less-structured, client-led groups).\nDebra
Grossman, M.A.\n301-443-2249\nEmail: dg79a@nih.gov\n25.\tDeveloping
Behavioral Treatments for Cognitively Impaired Drug Abusers.  While
there are currently many efficacious interventions available for drug
addicted individuals in treatment, more can potentially be done to
enhance treatments by addressing cognitive impairments that may
accompany chronic drug use and HIV infection. Many commonly utilized
drug addiction and HIV-risk reduction interventions assume certain basic
 cognitive capacities and abilities that may be absent, or impaired, in
chronic drug abusers who may also be HIV-positive. For substance abusers
 to benefit from psychological treatment, they must be capable of
attending to and receiving new information, integrating it with existing
 information stores, and translating this input into more concrete
behavioral change. Substance abusers with cognitive limitations, who may
 not comprehend the interventions, are more likely to drop out of
treatment, relapse faster, and have poorer long-term outcomes in
comparison to cognitively intact substance abusers. Research is needed
to develop, modify, and test \u201ccognitive-friendly\u201d drug
dependence treatments that could lead to improved treatment response and
 outcome.\n26.\tInterventions to Improve Engagement and Retention in
Treatment.  Therapies designed specifically to engage and retain
individuals in treatment, especially those at high risk for HIV. An
example could be a therapy that is: (1) sensitive to the age and
motivational level of the client; (2) is specifically designed to
respond to the needs of the individual, whatever his or her
developmental and motivational level might be; and (3) actively works to
 increase an individual's desire to remain in
treatment.\n27.\tDevelopment of New or Improved Addiction Assessment
Measures and Procedures.  Research directed at the improvement of a
currently available measure or the design of a new psychosocial, social
or environmental measure appropriate for use in the clinical assessment
of youth and adult substance abusing populations. Special consideration
should be given to a specific screening or diagnostic tool, or to a
specific measure of treatment readiness, treatment compliance, service
utilization, therapeutic process or drug treatment outcome.
\n28.\tMarijuana Treatment.  Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit
 substance in the U.S. However, relative to other drugs of abuse, little
 research has focused on the treatment of marijuana dependence. Trends
in the literature suggest that the types of treatments effective with
other substances of abuse are likely to be effective with marijuana
dependence. Initial studies also suggest that many patients do not show a
 positive treatment response, indicating that marijuana dependence is
not easily treated. Research is needed toward developing and testing
effective interventions for marijuana dependent
individuals.\n29.\tTransporting Behavioral Treatments to Community
Practitioners.  There is a need for effective methods of transferring
behavioral treatments found to be effective in Stage I clinical trials
to clinical practice. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, operant behavioral
therapy, group therapy, and family therapy are among the therapies that
have been shown to be efficacious in a highly controlled setting and may
 be helpful treatment approaches in community treatment programs as
well. However, community practitioners may have been trained using other
 approaches and may not have been exposed to these scientifically based
approaches. Emphasis should be placed on examining mechanisms to
transfer effective research-based drug abuse treatment information and
skills-based techniques to practitioners in the community. This may
involve the development and testing of innovative training materials and
 procedures to use in the training of community practitioners to
skillfully administer these treatments, including the development of
highly innovative technology transfer and communication approaches.
Research testing the transportability of empirically supported therapies
 to the community is an important component of the Behavioral and
Integrative Treatment Development Program.\n\tThere is also a need for
the development of educational methods to train non-drug abuse health
care workers in relating to drug abusers; eliciting medical histories
regarding past or present drug abuse; recognition of the signs and
symptoms of drug abuse; identification of those at high-risk for HIV and
 other drug abuse related medical problems such as tuberculosis or
hepatitis. Development and validation of a drug abuse screening
instrument which can be administered by primary health care providers,
and training in administering such an instrument is also needed.\nWill
Aklin, Ph.D.\n301-443-3207\nEmail: aklinwm@mail.nih.gov\n30.\tTreatment
Modules for Specific Problems or Populations.  Discrete therapy
components that address specific problems common among drug addicted
individuals and that can be implemented in conjunction with other
therapeutic services. For example, an investigator may wish to develop a
 four session, highly focused, job seeking skills module that can be
easily implemented by a wide range of practitioners to effectively
increase appropriate job seeking behavior. Other examples include, but
are not limited to, modules to engage ambivalent drug dependent
individuals in treatment, modules to increase assertiveness in female
drug addicts who feel pressured by others to use drugs, modules to
improve study skills and pro-social interactions among withdrawn
substance abusing adolescents, or to incorporate effective HIV risk
reduction techniques.\n31.\tBehavioral Treatments for Pre-Adolescents
and Adolescents.  Developmentally appropriate behavioral treatments for
pre-adolescents and adolescents that incorporate HIV risk reduction
counseling as an integral component of the treatment. This includes the
development of new, or refinement of existing psychotherapies,
behavioral therapies, and counseling (group and\/or individual). This
also includes the development and testing of manuals as well as other
creative, interactive approaches for therapy delivery that may consider
different settings for delivery, such as primary care, school-based
health programs, juvenile justice settings, etc. Also the behavioral
treatments should be culturally and gender sensitive.\n32.\tBehavioral
Treatments for Couples and Families.  This includes the development of
new psychotherapy approaches, the modification or testing of existing
behavioral treatments, and the design and\/or testing of innovative
clinical training and supervision methods for dissemination of
efficacious treatments to community settings, for youth and adult
substance users. Treatments that target domestic violence or other forms
 of interpersonal abuse along with substance abuse are
encouraged.\n33.\tInnovative Technologies for Drug Abuse Treatment, HIV
Risk Reduction, and Training Clinicians.  Relevant research would be
directed at the development and evaluation of innovative technologies to
 treat substance abuse, enhance adherence to medications, and\/or reduce
 risk for HIV infection or transmission. Approaches should be capable of
 being readily incorporated at reasonable cost into various treatment
settings. Areas of interest include Internet-based treatment or training
 programs, CD-ROM technology, audio delivery devices, photo therapeutic
instruments, and hand-held computers. Also of interest are creative
approaches for disseminating science-based behavioral treatments and for
 training therapists to use scientifically based treatments for drug
abuse and addiction. Such approaches might include Internet-based
education, interactive computer programs, telemedicine, etc. Finally,
approaches which apply therapies with evidence of efficacy through new
media such as web-based platforms, over email, or through chat rooms and
 bullet boards are also desirable.\nJessica Chambers,

Neuroscience Research.  The Clinical Neuroscience Branch (CNB) supports
research on the biological etiology (determining the biological basis
for vulnerability to drug abuse and progression to addiction, including
studies on individual differences and genetics) and clinical
neurobiology of addiction (exploring alterations of the structure
and\/or function of the human central nervous system following acute or
chronic exposure of drugs of abuse), and the neurobiology of development
 (neurobiological effects of drugs of abuse and addiction during various
 stages of development and maturation, effects of drug exposure on
neurobiological processes, development of methodologies and refinement
of techniques used in pediatric neuroimaging). The Branch also supports
investigations on the cognitive neuroscience of drug abuse and
addiction, the neurobiology of treatment, neuroAIDS, and human pain and
analgesia. Areas that may be of interest to small businesses include,
but are not limited to:\n1.\tInnovative Technology and Tools for Human
Substance Abuse Research.  There is a continuing need for the
development of methods, tools, and technology that can be used as
markers of or interventions for brain, genetic or behavioral (including
cognitive and affective) alterations in humans related to the risk, or
reliance (etiology) of, effects of, or recovery from substance abuse.
NIDA has a strong interest in facilitating the identification and use of
 cross-disciplinary research tools and materials that can be applied to
human research that will advance our understanding drug abuse. NIDA also
 has a strong interest in promoting the commercial adaptation and
widespread availability of discoveries (\u201ctools\u201d) made in the
course of interdisciplinary research to better serve its mission.\n\tThe
 term research \u201ctool" is being used in its broadest sense to
embrace the full range of resources that scientists use in the
laboratory and clinicians use as therapeutics; therefore, one
investigator\u2019s tool may be another's end product. The value of
research tools is difficult to assess and varies greatly from one tool
to the next and from one situation to the next. Providers and users are
likely to differ in their assessments of the value of research tools.
Many research and clinical tools are costly to develop and have
significant competitive value to the firms that own them.\n\tOf
particular interest are methods that could be used to determine the
effects of drug abuse\/ addiction treatments on neurobiological systems
in an attempt to understand the neurobiological processes underlying
risk and recovery. Also of interest are methods and tools that can be
integrated or expend with brain imaging techniques or other
brain-related measures that can be used in human subjects.\n\tExamples
include, but are not limited to; Development of stimulus-generating
hardware and\/or software for use in substance abuse studies, including
neurocognitive tasks, presentation of drug-related images for the
induction of craving or to probe attentional or affective processes, and
 \u201cvirtual reality\u201d types of dynamic stimuli important in
studies of drug abuse and addiction; Remote and mobile based
technologies such as PDA\u2019s, \u201csmart phones\u201d, or web-based
applications for measuring cognitive and affective function in real
world environments; Development or implementation of interventions such
as trans-cranial or direct current brain stimulation, real-time
neurofeedback, or cognitive training; New infomatic tools for primary
data analysis or secondary data analysis would also be appropriate;
\n\tAnother example would be methods or technology related to
development of the human central nervous system and how drugs of abuse
perturb this process. Developmental studies of these populations
presents unique challenges when using neuroimaging technology. The
development of novel techniques, or the refinement of existing methods,
to provide direct noninvasive measures of brain structure and\/or
function that are adapted specifically for use in pediatric and
adolescent populations is strongly encouraged. Also, neurocognitive and
other neurobehavioral tasks for use in these populations, especially
where they can be designed to probe underlying neurobiological
processes, need to be developed (for developmental issues, contact

cboyce@nida.nih.gov\n2.\tHuman Brain Neurochemical and Molecular
Imaging.  Measurement of brain neurochemistry, neuropharmacology
(receptors) and gene expression in humans using non-invasive imaging has
 lagged behind advances in these areas in pre-clinical research as well
as in functional and anatomical neuroimaging in humans. There is a
continuing need for development of new ways to measure molecular targets
 in the human brain. Examples include, but are not limited to novel
radioligands for PET and SPECT imaging in human brain for molecular
targets (e.g., receptors, intracellular messengers, disease-related
proteins), as well as novel methods that use magnetic resonance imaging
or other emerging technologies such as optical imaging.. The primary
application of these methods will be in basic human research.
Ultimately, these measures may also be used as potential biological
markers and surrogate endpoints for translational and clinical research,
 drug discovery and development, and clinical trials. The scope of the
projects may encompass pilot or clinical feasibility evaluation in
pre-clinical studies, model development, or clinical studies.
Alternatively, the focus may be on research and development of new
technologies for molecular, neurochemical or neuropharmacological
development.\nSteven Grant, Ph.D.\n301-443-4877\nEmail:
sgrant@nida.nih.gov\n3.\tNeuro-Rehabilitation of Drug-Induced Cognitive
Deficiencies.  The increased awareness that the brain is capable of
substantial plasticity throughout the lifespan has opened the
possibility that intervention can be developed alter brain or cognitive
function so as to accelerate recovery of brain and cognitive
dysfunction. Such interventions encompass both direct interventions of
brain function as well as indirect interventions based on cognitive or
behavioral principles. \n\tDirect interventions include trans-cranial or
 direct current brain stimulation, real-time neurofeedback, and deep
brain stimulation.\n\tAnother complementary approach is based on game
technology for \u201cserious (health-related) rather than purely
recreational purposes. Serious games can provide a completely
controlled, noninvasive, safe and alternative methodology for a variety
of important studies of drug abuse and addiction. By involving a person
in an interactive computerized situation, designed to be both
entertaining yet directive (i.e., in the sense of covertly shaping
desired behaviors via highly flexible and programmable sets of
scenarios), altered behaviors can be introduced by pre-programming
consequences to counteract and potentially reset undesirable
neurobiological and neurobehavioral deficits associated with chronic
drug abuse.\n\t\tAreas of cognitive impairment related to substance
abuse that could be enhanced through the use of either direct brain
interventions, or \u201cserious\u201d games include diminished
decision-making ability, attention\/concentration deficits, attentional
biases, lack of cognitive flexibility and problem solving abilities,
inability to use feedback to monitor\/change behavior, memory
impairments,. \nSteven Grant, Ph.D.\n301-402-1746\nEmail:

to Substance Abuse.  There is the need for development, improvement
and\/or adaptation of precise and reliable field deployable measurement
technologies can detect and quantify an individual\u2019s exposure to
psychosocial stress and\/or one or more drugs. Ideally, the technology
could be scalable from selected samples to full population studies.
Comprehensive assessment includes measuring acute\/chronic\/cumulative
exposures to psychosocial stress and\/or addictive substances with a
high degree of temporal and spatial resolution (i.e., as a person moves
through environments), and with a high degree of accuracy and
sensitivity to detect meaningful variations in extent of and response to
 exposure across developmental periods (ranging from prenatal to
senescence) and among various population groups. Such technologies may
include use of emerging remote and mobile technologies such as
PDA\u2019s, \u201csmart phones\u201d, or web-based applications.\nHarold

during pregnancy, and investigating vulnerability and possible pathways
to drug abuse including children in primary care and child care
settings, and school-age children and adolescents. Human subject issues
addressing family environments, child abuse and domestic violence, and
secondary data sources are also of interest. These database systems
should address issues such as assent and consent, should provide
information on variation in laws and guidelines across jurisdictions,
should include the capacity for interactive communication on numerous

phenomenon of drug addiction need to be empirically driven, there are
limited funds to support original international drug abuse research
which subsequently increases the importance of secondary analyses of
existing data sources particularly in low- and middle-income countries.
The mechanism to expand the use of existing data sources that can inform
 policy is likely be multifaceted and may include: identification of

SCIENCES (NIEHS)",
        "description": "Human health and human disease result from three
 interactive elements: the environment, genetics, and age. The mission
of the NIEHS is to reduce the burden of human disease and dysfunction
from environmental causes by understanding each of these components and
how they interrelate. NIEHS achieves its mission through a
multidisciplinary biomedical research program, prevention and
intervention efforts, and a communication strategy that encompasses
training, education, and technology transfer and community outreach.
NIEHS supports research and training focused on the identification,
assessment and mechanism of action of agents in the environment and how
they contribute to disease and dysfunction. The ultimate goal of these
NIEHS activities is to then transfer this knowledge for the public
benefit. The SBIR program uses a combination of research, technology
transfer and communication strategies to aid the mission of NIEHS.\nFor
additional information about the areas of interest to NIEHS, visit our
home page at http:\/\/www.niehs.nih.gov.\nTools for Improved Exposure
Assessment\nFundamental to the NIEHS mission is the ability to quantify
an individual\u2019s exposure, as well as the unique characteristics
that account for individualized responses to the exposures. The goal for
 improved exposure assessment is to develop new technology and assays to
 generate precise measurements of human exposure to chemical and
biological agents that may lead to disease or dysfunction. The desired
application of these technologies and assays is in population-based
(epidemiological) or clinical research and practice. An emphasis is
placed on tools that provide individual exposure metrics either at the
point of contact or through measuring internal dose of environmental
agents.\nIt is anticipated that the new technologies and assays, such as
 those based on micro- and nanotechnology and molecular imaging, may
provide sensitive, high-throughput, and potentially portable systems
capable of measuring exposure to environmental agents and the impact of
the exposures on human biology. \n1.  WEARABLE TECHNOLOGIES FOR PERSONAL
 EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT AT THE POINT OF CONTACT\nThe NIEHS is interested in
 developing and validating new products\/devices, tools, assays to
improve our ability to precisely measure an individual\u2019s exposure
to environmental agents, with high temporal and spatial resolution.
Ideally, the technologies, tools and assays will be of appropriate scale
 to be field deployable and\/or wearable. These point-of-contact devices
 should be capable of measuring simultaneously and in near real time,
multiple agents within a single exposure class (e.g., multiple types of
metals, multiple size fractions of particulate matter, multiple
components of diesel exhaust) and\/or multiple agents across more than
one exposure class. Exposures of interest include ozone, particulate
matter, diesel exhaust, metals (e.g., arsenic, cadmium, or mercury),
volatile organic compounds, polybrominated diphenyls (PBDEs), polycyclic
 aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), mold\/microbial toxins, allergens and
pesticides\/herbicides. Examples include but are not limited
to:\nA.\tNovel technologies and assays to generate precise, quantitative
 measures of human exposure to environmental compounds at the point of
contact or in easily obtained biological samples (e.g., skin, breath,
saliva, or nasal mucosa). An emphasis is placed on the ability to
measure multiple analytes simultaneously. \nB.\tRemote sensing
technologies for detecting, quantifying, and monitoring household
exposures to toxicants and\/or bioaerosols. \n2.  TECHNOLOGIES FOR
GENERATING PRECISE MEASUREMENTS OF INTERNAL DOSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL
AGENTS\nThe NIEHS is interested in developing technologies and devices
to generate precise measurements of internal dose of individual
environmental agents and or their metabolites in real time and over
time. It would be especially valuable to analyze internal dose over time
 of multiple agents within a single class or multiple agents across more
 than one class. The development of a modular design allowing
measurement of specific classes of chemical exposures for application in
 epidemiological studies (e.g., pesticides, endocrine-active chemicals,
or components of indoor air pollution) is preferred. Likewise, an
emphasis is placed on measuring environmental factors with mixed routes
of exposure (i.e., inhalation, ingestion, and dermal exposure) for which
 biomonitoring is the only comprehensive exposure metric. \nExamples
include but are not limited to:\nA.\tDevelopment of sensors for
measuring the levels of toxicants in biospecimens easily attained for an
 individual such as finger prick, buccal cells, exhaled breath or
urine.\nB.\tThe development of integrated devices linking exposure at
the point of contact, internal dose, and biological response.\nHazardous
 Substances Detection and Remediation Program\nThe NIEHS Superfund
Research Program (SRP) is interested in applying biotechnology and
bioengineering approaches to develop novel strategies to characterize,
monitor, and remediate hazardous substances at contaminated sites. SRP
encourages applicants to develop green \/ sustainable detection
technologies and remediation approaches that improve energy efficiency
and reduce waste generation.\nExamples include but are not limited
to:\nA.\tDevelopment of advanced technologies that allow for real-time,
on-site monitoring such as nanotechnology\u2013based sensors and probes,
 biosensors, self-contained miniaturized toxicity-screening kits and
miniaturized analytical probes and data analysis tools.\nB.\tDevelopment
 of methods or devices to detect and measure vapor intrusion or to
detect non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) and dense non-aqueous phase
liquids (DNAPLs) in the subsurface.\nC.\tDevelopment of assays or
devices to determine the extent to which a contaminant is
bioavailable.\nD.\tDevelopment of instruments to identify subsurface
geological structures and hydro-geological configurations and to sample
for the presence of contaminants in these structures. \nE.\tDevelopment
of novel technologies for in situ remediation of contaminated sediments,
 soils, and groundwater.\nF.\tDevelopment of cost-effective devices to
detect or remediate chemical mixtures in environmental
media.\nG.\tDevelopment of nano-enabled structures, electrochemical
methods, photocatalytic processes, thermal treatments, or
filtration-based methods of remediation. \nH.\tDevelopment of
bioremediation and phytoremediation technologies including the use of
genetic engineering approaches.\nSRP recognizes the important public
health impact of detection or remediation technologies that are
applicable to non point-source air pollution and drinking water;
however, a higher priority will be placed on remediation and detection
technologies with a clear connection to sites impacted by hazardous
substances.\nImproved Test Systems for Prioritization and Safety
Evaluation\nThe NIEHS is interested in: (1) developing, standardizing,
and validating sensitive and specific innovative tests and integrated
testing strategies that can reduce, refine, or replace animal use and
that will provide improved predictivity, and potential cost and time
savings compared to current standard laboratory animal tests ( i.e.,
assays for carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity, reproductive or
developmental toxicity, dermal toxicity, and neuro or other organ system
 toxicity including acute local and systemic toxicity); and (2)
developing mid- and high-throughput screens and tests using
phylogenetically lower animal species (e.g., fish, worms) to evaluate
mechanisms of toxicity to identify mechanisms of chemically-induced
biological activity, prioritize chemicals for more extensive
toxicological evaluation, and develop more predictive models of in vivo
biological response. The proposed tests and strategies should use
computational and\/or biochemical models, cell\/ tissue cultures,
and\/or animal models that are relevant to existing safety assessment
databases and human experience, and that can be extrapolated to estimate
 risks to humans. The endpoints for these tests or assays should take
advantage of the new technologies such as genomics, transcriptomics,
proteomics, and bioinformatics and of novel endpoints (biomarkers)
including those that are non-invasive. Examples include but are not
limited to:\nA.\tBiokinetic models that include the integration of
toxicodynamic and biokinetic modeling to predict acute and chronic
systemic toxicity.\nB.\tIn vitro test methods and integrated strategies
(e.g., undifferentiated\/ differentiated human\/mammalian cell model
systems, organotypic model systems, biochemical activity (e.g., peptide
binding; and computational models) that can be used to prioritize
compounds for more extensive testing and\/or to predict acute and
chronic toxicity by taking into account, for example, metabolism, the
ability of chemicals to pass through barriers (i.e., blood brain,
kidney, lung, gastrointestinal), and organ specific effects, or which
allow the development of endpoints that can be extrapolated to in vivo
biomarkers of toxicity. An emphasis is placed on the development of
engineered 3D tissue systems that include multiple cell types and that
replicate the anatomy and function of intact tissue. Of particular
interest are systems that replicate key functions of major organs (e.g.,
 skin, kidney, lung and the gastro-intestinal track) and the ability to
incorporate immunological function in these models. \nC.\tAlternative
assays and integrated strategies to assess dermal irritation, dermal
absorption, dermal hypersensitivity phototoxicity, and ocular
toxicity.\nD.\tNon-mammalian or invertebrate models for specific
toxicities that utilize endpoint that are conserved across species so
the results can be extrapolated to human risk.\nE.\tIdentification and
validation of predictive biomarkers that can be used to obtain improved
mechanistic information and\/or serve as the basis for earlier endpoints
 in toxicological studies.\nOther Topics Within the Mission of the

 It also includes links to program announcements that highlight NIGMS
areas of special emphasis (http:\/\/www.nigms.nih.gov\/Research). In
some cases, these announcements specifically mention the SBIR and STTR
grant mechanisms, in most cases they do not. However, it is clear that
small businesses could make contributions to the research objectives
described in these announcements.\nPhase IIB Competing Renewal
Awards\nNIGMS will accept Phase IIB SBIR-only Competing Renewal grant
applications to continue the process of developing products that
ultimately require 1) clinical evaluation, 2) approval by a Federal
regulatory agency, and 3) continuing refinements to durable medical
equipment (DME) designs such as cost reduction, testing for safety,
durability, and reliability, and meeting or establishing standards. This
 renewal grant should allow small businesses to get to reach a stage
where interest and investment by third parties is more likely. Such
products include, but are not limited to biological products, devices,
drugs, medical implants, etc. related to the mission of the NIGMS. The
previously funded Phase II SBIR grant need not have been submitted in
response to a particular solicitation, as long as the research is
appropriate to the purpose of this solicitation. Budgets up to $750,000
total costs per year and time periods up to 2 years may be requested for
 this Phase IIB Competing Renewal opportunity. These awards are intended
 to support completion of research needed to obtain an IND or IDE.
Applicants must provide evidence that they have consulted formally with
the FDA concerning the research needed for the development of a drug,
biologic or medical device and that the proposed research will address
these regulatory requirements. Such evidence should include FDA
correspondence from a pre-IND meeting for an IND application or a
pre-IDE meeting for an IDE application, and the status of the project in
 a timeline related to Federal regulatory approval
processes.\nProspective applicants are strongly encouraged to contact

        "topic_name": "NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE
(NHGRI)",
        "description": "The successful completion of the HGP in 2003 set
 the stage for making use of the immense potential inherent in knowledge
 of the complete DNA sequence of the human genome to be applied for the
improvement of human health and well-being. In an effort to outline a
path forward, the Vision Document (Nature 422,835-847 (2003)) broadly
outlined three areas that need to be addressed: (1) elucidating the
structure and function of genomes; (2) translating genome-based
knowledge into health benefits; and (3) promoting the use of genomics to
 maximize benefits and minimize harms. The latter area relates closely
to NHGRI\u2019s Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) Program.
The research topics encompassed by this area have traditionally been
included in a separate program announcement. However, given the growing
interrelatedness of genomics to research in humans and to applications
in health care and other settings, it has become increasingly clear that
 the investigation of ELSI issues cannot be separated from the genomic
research that generates these issues. As a result, the ELSI research
agenda is described in this NHGRI-wide announcement, as well as in a
separate ELSI-specific Program Announcement
http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/pa-files\/PA-08-012.html).\nThe
purpose of this document is to provide information to investigators
about the breadth of NHGRI\u2019s research interests and is very similar
 the Institute\u2019s general funding opportunity announcements
(http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/ guide\/pa-files\/PA-07-458.html and
http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/pa-files\/PA-07-459.html). When
appropriate, NHGRI will publish Requests for Applications that will be
used to stimulate research in specific areas, to fill gaps in research
knowledge, or to generate community resources that will further the
mission of genomics or ELSI research.\nThe following are areas of high
interest for investigator-initiated applications; they are not listed in
 priority order.\nTechnology and Methods Development \nTechnology
development in DNA sequencing and genotyping are examples of activities
that have changed the nature of what scientific research questions are
practical to address, have enabled new approaches, and have potentiated
the development of new community resource data sets. Many areas of
critical importance to the realization of the genomics-based vision for
biomedical research require continued technological and methodological
developments before pilots and then large-scale approaches can be
attempted. Accordingly, the NHGRI will continue to support the
development of new, fundamental technologies in all areas of genomics.
Other important areas in which technology development applications would
 be responsive to this Program Announcement include (but are not limited
 to) analyses of gene expression, discovery and characterization of
genetic variation; identification of the genetic contributions to
health, disease, and drug response; statistical analytic methods for
understanding human genomic variation and its relationship to health and
 disease; and chemical genomics. There is also continued interest in
supporting technology development for the comprehensive discovery of
functional elements in the human and model organism genomes, and new DNA
 sequencing technology. Many of these assays would benefit from the
ability to work with very small amounts of starting material, to the
limit of single cells.\nThe Institute is also interested in contributing
 selectively to the development of new and needed technology in related
areas, such as proteomics and systems biology research, when NHGRI
funding can be used to further a truly unique development that will have
 a significant impact on the field.\nBioinformatics\nGenome databases
are essential resources for the biological and biomedical research
communities. The creation and maintenance of effective databases are as
important a component of research funding as data generation. The NHGRI
has been a primary source of support for several major
genetics\/genomics-oriented databases and will continue to foster
technology improvements to develop effective methods for integrating,
displaying, and providing access to genomic information. Projects
addressing new database technologies to improve the utility of genome
databases would be appropriate as applications. \nComputational
Biology\nThe NHGRI has supported the generation of many large-scale
genomic data sets such as genome sequence, haplotype maps, transcriptome
 measurements, protein interactions, and functional elements. NHGRI
encourages the development of new computational methods and tools to
analyze these and other large datasets, and to extract useful biological
 information from them. Where possible, existing community data
standards and methods for data exchange should be used in the
development of these new methods and tools. Further information on
programs related to genomic databases and computational biology is
available at this website: http:\/\/www.genome.gov\/10001735.\nThe
development of new sequencing technologies has dramatically increased
the amount of data produced for genomics. NHGRI is interested in
supporting new computational applications for the production and
analysis of data from these new sequencing platforms. These applications
 would include better computational methods for storage, compression and
 transfer of large datasets by biomedical researchers along with better
analysis methods to interpret these data and integrate with other data
types.\nSome genomic data analysis and display tools have been developed
 that already are used in the community that would benefit from
additional work to support broader dissemination, for example making
them efficient, reliable, robust, well-documented, and well-supported.
NHGRI will support projects to extend the support for these informatics
tools to make them readily adopted by any biomedical research laboratory
 that wishes to use genomic technologies to address biological
questions.\nPopulation Genomics \nThis is an emerging discipline that
applies genomic technologies, such as genome-wide association testing
and sequencing, to population studies to identify gene regions, genes,
or variants affecting common etiologically complex conditions and
predict individual risk. It also investigates the value of applying
genomic methods in clinical care for the diagnosis, treatment, and
prevention of complex diseases. The research scope of Population
Genomics at NHGRI includes: developing resources and statistical methods
 for observational studies and clinical trials incorporating advanced
genomic technologies; conducting proof-of-principle studies that apply
genomic technologies to particular conditions that can be generalized to
 a broader range of conditions (e.g., translating genomic information to
 clinical care); and developing research methods and infrastructure
needed for future epidemiologic studies of genetic and environmental
contribution to disease in the United States, including a large,
prospective cohort study of genes and environment. For additional
information about Population Genomics within NHGRI, please visit this
website: http:\/\/www.genome.gov\/19518660.\nEthical, Legal and Social
Implications\nNHGRI supports studies that examine issues and, where
appropriate, develop policy options in the following areas: 1) the
translation of genomic information to improved human health; 2) the
conduct of genomic research\u2014particularly genome-wide association
studies, medical sequencing and clinical studies; 3) intellectual
property issues surrounding access to and use of genomic information; 4)
 the use of genomic information and technologies in non-health care
settings; 5) the impact of genomics on concepts of race, ethnicity,
kinship and individual and group identity; 6) the implications, for both
 individuals and society, of uncovering genetic contributions not only
to disease but also to 'normal' human traits and behaviors; and 7) how
different individuals, cultures, and religious traditions view the
ethical boundaries for the uses of genetics and genomics. Several of
these topics are closely integrated with genomic research, which is why
they are described here.\nOther Research Topic(s) Within the Mission of
the Institute \nIndividuals interested in any of the above listed areas

 and http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/pa-files\/PA-08-056.html.
The NIMH will accept Phase IIB SBIR Competing Renewal grant applications
 in two categories: 1) to continue research and development of
technologies that ultimately require federal regulatory approval (see
below and see
http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/notice-files\/NOT-MH-09-008.html,
 and 2) to continue research and development of complex instrumentation,
 clinical research tools, or behavioral interventions and treatments
(see below and see funding opportunity announcement PA-08-056, entitled
\u201cCompeting Renewal Awards of SBIR Phase II Grants for Brain and
Behavior Tools (R44)\u201d
http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/pa-files\/PA-08-056.html.\nTechnologies
 in the former category (those that ultimately require federal
regulatory approval) include, but are not limited to: pharmacologic
agents and drugs, biological products, medical devices, vaccines, etc.,
related to the mission of the NIMH. Phase IIB SBIR Competing Renewal
grants for such technologies should allow small businesses to get
research and development to a stage where interest and investment by
third parties is more likely. Companies engaging in drug development for
 the treatment of mental health disorders may be eligible to submit
Competing Renewal applications through the specific funding opportunity
announcement PA-08-142 entitled \u201cPharmacologic Agents and Drugs for
 Mental Disorders (SBIR [R43\/R44])\u201d
http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/pa-files\/PA-08-142.html. For
this specific opportunity, budgets up to $1.0 million total costs per
year and time periods up to three years may be requested.\nCompanies
that are developing technologies that do not focus on drug development,
but that require federal regulatory approval prior to commercialization,
 may be eligible to submit a Phase IIB Competing Renewal application
through the standard SBIR funding opportunity announcement. For this
opportunity, budget limits of up to $800,000 total costs per year and
time periods up to 3 years may be requested.\nPlease contact your
Program Director or Dr. Margaret Grabb (contact information provided
below) before beginning the process of putting an application together.
In addition, prospective applicants are strongly encouraged to submit to
 the program contact a letter of intent that includes the following
information: \n\u2022\tDescriptive title of the proposed research
\n\u2022\tName, address, and telephone number of the Principal
Investigator \n\u2022\tNames of other key personnel
\n\u2022\tParticipating institutions \n\u2022\tFunding Opportunity
Announcement Number (e.g., PA-10-XXX) \nAlthough a letter of intent is
not required, is not binding, and does not enter into the review of a
subsequent application, the information that it contains allows NIH
staff to estimate the potential review workload and plan the review. It
is expected that only a portion of NIMH SBIR Phase II awards will be
eligible for a Phase IIB Competing Renewal grant.\nThe following
examples would make appropriate topics for proposed NIMH SBIR Phase IIB
Competing Renewal projects. These are meant for illustrative purposes
only and are not exclusive of other appropriate
activities:\n\u2022\tPreclinical studies, including pharmacology and
toxicology, beyond those conducted under the Phase I (R43) and initial
Phase II (R44) grants. Some in vivo or in vitro studies would be
expected to have been carried out in Phase I or the initial Phase II
grant.\n\u2022\tCompletion of studies as required by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for Investigational New Drug (IND) or Radioactive
Drug Research Committee (RDRC) application.\n\u2022\tStudies in normal
healthy volunteers to determine a drug\u2019s safety profile,
metabolism, etc.\n\u2022\tClinical studies in patient\/disease
population to assess the drug\u2019s effectiveness.\n\u2022\tAssessment
of devices with regard to performance standards related to the FDA
approval process.\n\u2022\tSafety and effectiveness studies of novel
medical devices.\n\u2022\tEvaluation of novel imaging approaches for
diagnostic purposes.\n\u2022\tClinical studies in support of Pre-Market
Approval for biomarkers\/medical devices by the FDA.\nAlthough
technologies in the latter category (complex instrumentation, clinical
research tools, or behavioral interventions\/treatments) may not require
 federal regulatory approval, extraordinary time and effort is needed
for their research and development. Therefore, NIMH supports Phase IIB
Competing Renewal awards of existing Phase II grants for such
technologies. The Phase IIB Competing Renewal award for these would
provide up to an additional three years of support at total cost funding
 levels of up to $800,000 per year. Applicants should apply through the
funding opportunity announcement PA-08-056, entitled \u201cCompeting
Renewal Awards of SBIR Phase II Grants for Brain and Behavior Tools

Basic Behavioral Science\nThrough research in neuroscience and basic
behavioral science we can gain an understanding of the fundamental
mechanisms underlying thought, emotion, and behavior and an
understanding of what goes wrong in the brain in mental illness.
Research sponsored by the Division of Neuroscience and Basic Behavioral
Science covers a broad range of neuroscience topics: from both
experimental and theoretical approaches, from molecules to whole brains
to populations of individuals, from single cell organisms to humans,
from across the entire lifespan, and from states of health and disease.
This division also supports research on the basic behavioral,
psychological, and social processes that underlie normal behavioral
functioning. The topics listed below reflect the NIMH interest in
technologies related to this broad range, but should not be considered a
 complete list. Prospective applicants are strongly encouraged to
contact Dr. Margaret Grabb (listed below) with questions about the
relevance of their interests to the mission of this
division.\nA.\tCutting-Edge Technologies for Neuroscience Research. Most
 of the research topics listed after this one are posed from the
Division's neuroscience and basic behavioral science mission-oriented
perspective, however, the technologies that might be developed to
address those mission goals might be quite fundamental. Prospective
applicants familiar with such technologies, but not familiar with the
mission-related use of these technologies, are strongly encouraged to
contact Dr. Margaret Grabb (listed below) for assistance in bridging
this gap between their technical knowledge and knowledge of the
neuroscience-related mission of NIMH. Technologies and approaches that
might be used in products relevant to this mission include, but are not
limited to:\n1.\tCaged Molecules. These chemical entities could be
activated, or could release an active agent, when specified bonds are
broken by chemical, biochemical, photic, or other means. Among other
uses, such molecules could be used to indicate biochemical or
physiological processes or to deliver pharmacologic substances to highly
 localized brain regions.\n2.\tGenetically Engineered Proteins. Such
proteins could be put to any number of uses, including to express a
fluorophore or chromophore at the occurrence of specific biochemical
processes to report the time and location of such processes in brain
tissue.\n3.\tInducible Gene Expression. Methods to turn on or off
expression of particular genes in animals on the basis of time in the
lifespan, location in the brain, or other factors. Such a capability
would significantly advance basic brain research, and would have
important implications for treatment and therapy of mental
illness.\n4.\tCombinatorial Approaches. These are high-through-put
approaches that can be used to screen and synthesize molecules that
affect brain cells.\n5.\tBiocompatible Biomaterials. Such research and
development relates to the chronic use of electrodes and other probes
used in brain research, as well as implanted drug delivery
devices.\n6.\tNanotechnologies. This emerging area of technology
presents a wide range of opportunities for brain research, from the
fabrication of probes to monitor brain physiology to novel means of
delivering drugs and other substances.\n7.\tInformatics Tools. Such
technologies allow brain scientists, clinicians and theorists to make
better sense and use of their data. These tools and approaches include
those to acquire, store, visualize, analyze, integrate, synthesize and
share data, including those for electronic
collaboration.\n8.\tSimulation Technologies. Computer-based,
biologically realistic simulations of parts of neurons, neurons, and
circuits. \n9.\tMathematical, Statistical and Computer Algorithms. Such
algorithms could be used to analyze large and\/or complex data sets.
Examples of these data sets include those derived from multiple,
single-unit recording studies and functional imaging studies. Among
other applications, these could be used to segment images (obtained from
 electron or light microscopes, or from volumetric imaging instruments
such as confocal microscopes and magnetic resonance imagers), filter
noise, visualize data or search vast data sets for specified patterns or
 data (e.g., use of pattern recognition algorithms to search time series
 data sets obtained from electrophysiological recording of neural
activity, or video data obtained from behavioral analysis of genetically
 altered animals). In addition, digital reconstruction of dendritic and
axonal arbors would be of interest.\n10.\tTelemetry. Transferring data
from one point to another is important for neuroscientists monitoring
the physiological signals from the brain. Telemetry, even over
relatively short distances (from a few millimeters to a few meters),
could, for example, provide a means to obtain data from awake, behaving
animals without interfering with the behavior of interest. Examples
include telemetry that can be easily implanted\/attached to awake
behaving animals for measuring peripheral\/autonomic responses (this
approach could be used to inform stress\/emotion research), miniaturized
 telemetry for use in smaller animals with increased numbers of
recording devices\/electrodes implanted per animal. Alternatives to
telemetry would be considered as well.\n11.\tBiosensors. Neurons
communicate with each other through thousands of different chemical
substances; internally, molecular pathways direct the function of the
neuron. Sensors of high specificity and sensitivity for such substances
would provide neuroscientists with important new ways to study the
brain.\nB.\tInstrumentation for Basic Neuroscience Research. Modern
equipment that uses the most recent technological advances is needed in
neuroscience research so that neural substrates of mental illness can be
 identified and localized. The NIMH is interested in supporting research
 and development of new or improved approaches relevant to, but not
limited to, the following:\n1.\tNeurophysiology. Microelectrodes for
stimulation and\/or recording, smart nanoscaffolds, macroelectrodes,
biocompatible coatings, interfaces to electronics, software for data
analysis, visualization, etc. Systems with better\/easier MR
compatibility would also be of interest.\n2.\tCell Sorting. Based on
cell size, type, function, morphology, abnormal features, specific
membrane proteins, etc.\n3.\tIn Vivo Electrochemical Voltammetry. More
sensitive and selective electrodes, software for data analysis,
etc.\n4.\tHigh Performance Liquid Chromatography. Improved reliability,
specificity, sensitivity, etc.\n5.\tTechnology to support Multiple Unit
Recording Electrode Arrays. Recording techniques, analysis techniques
and raw data storage.\n6.\tPhysiological and Behavioral Monitoring.
Temperature, activity, sleep duration, neuronal activity, EEG activity,
EKG, pulse rate, recording, capture and analysis of multiple single unit
 activity from microelectrodes, automated SWS analysis and coherence of
EEG rhythms, and further refinement of High density
EEGs.\n7.\tDevelopment of novel technologies for stimulating specific
cells or signaling pathways in awake behaving animals.\n8.\tDevelopment
of more sensitive fluorescent probes for simultaneous and real time
measures of multiple neurotransmitter release and intracellular
signaling pathway activities.\n9.\tAssociated Software.\nC.\tMacroscopic
 Neuroimaging. Modern technologies allow for the observation of the
structure and function of the intact brain. This capability has the
potential to greatly advance understanding of the brain in both health
and disease, and across the lifespan. NIMH is interested in advancing
this area of technology through enhancing current tools and approaches,
as well as developing entirely new ways to image the brain. All
modalities are of interest, including, but not limited to: magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) or spectroscopy, positron emission tomography
(PET), optical imaging or spectroscopy, single photon emission computed
tomography, magnetoencephalography (MEG), diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI), etc. While not an imaging technique itself, transcranial magnetic
 stimulation (TMS) is an associated, important technology. TMS can be
used in combination with fMRI as means to further assess physiology and
integrity of neural systems both in health and in mental disorders. Due
to its greatly increased use in recent years, technologies specifically
focused on improving the utility and specificity of fMRI techniques are
of particular interest.\n1.\tInnovative agents and\/or technologies to
visualize brain connectivity, activity, and neural plasticity in situ
with minimal invasion.\n2.\tImprovement in the techniques, the design
and construction of devices for non-invasive imaging for any modality,
for example, improving spatial resolution, quantitative accuracy,
signal-to-noise ratio, and electronics.\n3.\tDevelopment and enhancement
 of non-invasive imaging techniques for evaluating alterations in brain
physiology produced by drugs. These would include techniques for
monitoring changes in regional blood flow; concentrations of drug
and\/or tissue metabolites; and the distribution and activity of
receptors.\n4.\tSynthesis, or isolation from natural products, of highly
 selective receptor ligands or indicators of neurochemical processes,
which would be labeled for imaging by one or more particular
modality.\n5.\tDevelopment of selective hormone receptor ligands for
brain imaging.\n6.\tDevelopment of imaging agents to examine the
integrity of the blood brain barrier following infection and other
environmental challenges.\n7.\tNew approaches in radiochemistry that
will permit more exact identification of the chemical changes associated
 with behavioral states (e.g., sleep or arousal) or mental illness as
observed with any particular neuroimaging modality.\n8.\tSynthesis of
molecules containing stable, rarely occurring isotopes designed to be
detected by non-invasive imaging techniques (e.g., fluorine-containing
molecules, carbon-13 labeled substrates).\n9.\tMethods and associated
products for quantification of imaging data including new statistical
approaches for evaluating the data.\n10.\tMethods to integrate routines
for greater and more precise computer enhancement of the images, and for
 combining or overlaying images obtained from multiple modalities.
\n11.\tSoftware needed for the precise quantification of data obtained
from these imaging techniques with emphasis on the reliable definition
of discrete, anatomically distinct areas within the brain.\n12.\tNovel
agents or other tools to increase the ability to correlate features of
MR images with histological features (e.g., cytoarchitecture or
chemoarchitecture) both identified and those yet to be
identified.\n13.\tGeneration of physiologic measurements from images of
regional radioactivity generated during PET, especially for the study of
 brain neurotransmitter\/neuroreceptor systems.\n14.\tNovel approaches
to visualizing data obtained in neuroimaging, such as the computational
\u201cunfolding\u201d of three-dimensional images of cerebral
cortex.\n15.\tImproved methods for pediatric brain imaging. These would
include: software and database products, equipment for creating a
\u201cchild-friendly\u201d environment and for the behavioral training
of children and impaired subjects for cooperation and motion reduction
during neuroimaging procedures.\n16.\tCombining of different imaging
technologies (e.g., ERPs and fMRI; MEG and fMRI; MEG and EEG,
optogenetic methods and fMRI, etc.). The latter example, optfMRI, can be
 used as means of improving tools for further understanding of neural
bases of fMRI signals and to produce connectivity a map of neural cells
that can be defined both genetically and topographically with a
combination of these two techniques.\n17.\tNew tools and devices to
simultaneously record hemodynamic signals (BOLD, rCBF, etc.) and neural
activity (EEG, LFP, spiking, etc.) to better understand the direct
relationship between blood flow variables and neural activity within the
 brain.\n18.\tDevelopment of equipment, software and other tools for
recording and quantifying eye movements, motion, and autonomic
reactivity during scanning, applicable to all ages (including young
children) particularly in the MRI environment.\n19.\tMethods for
relating changes in brain morphology and metabolism associated with age,
 particularly infancy through adolescence, to changes in hemodynamic
responses to neural activity and fMRI signals.\n20.\tImprovements in TMS
 techniques that will allow for greater specificity in the sites of
stimulation and greater control over the effects of the stimulation. In
particular, improvements in stimulators that would allow much smaller
effective fields of stimulation with more reliable and repeatable
stimulator placement would be a significant benefit to the
field.\n21.\tReal time fMRI is becoming a research tool of interest with
 potential clinical\/therapeutic neurofeedback applications. Products
are needed that would enhance the ability of scientists to use this
technology for those neurofeedback applications in an off-the-shelf
manner.\n22.\tDevelopment of methods to improve efficiency, specificity
and controllability of viruses used in primate tract tracing
studies.\n23.\tDevelopment of more sophisticated imaging strategies in
rodents.\n24.\tDevelopment of a user-friendly interface to serial
reconstruction software capable of generating stackable, 3D images of
axonal and dendritic arborizations at the light and electron microscopic
 level.\nD.\tMicroscopic Neuroimaging. The morphology of individual
neurons and the distribution of subcellular components within them, are
key to understanding the manner in which these cells function. Advances
in the development of agents indicating neuronal structure and function
that can be visualized microscopically are important to the NIMH's
interest in brain research. This includes enhancements of current agents
 and ligands to be imaged (agents indicating specific biochemical
processes or structures, etc.); development of novel agents and ligands;
 software to assist interaction with the data; and other related
technologies and methods. Examples would include, but not be limited
to:\n1.\tSoftware and hardware for analyzing image data obtained by
microscopes, including tools to automatically or semi-automatically.
Identify particular profiles (e.g., labeled cell bodies), segment
images, reconstruct images into three dimensional representations,
perform unbiased counting and measuring, etc.\n2.\tSynthesis and testing
 of novel or improved probes for microimaging the nervous
system.\nE.\tMolecular and Cellular Neurobiology and Neurochemistry.
Manipulating and studying basic molecular, cellular and chemical
processes has led to insight to understanding brain function, and has
provided the foundation on which pharmacological interventions have been
 developed for the treatment of mental illness. NIMH is interested in
supporting a wide range of new techniques and tools related to this
area. These include, but are not limited to:\n1.\tNew low-cost
techniques for hybridoma production of monoclonal antibodies specific
for \u201cneural antigens\u201d (e.g., neurotransmitters, small
peptides, neurotransmitter receptors).\n2.\tInnovative methods for
establishing a \u201cmonoclonal bank\u201d (frozen cells) for each of
the cell lines as a permanent, widely available, reliable, and low cost
source of monoclonal antibodies for research on the nervous
system.\n3.\tLabeled antibodies or other agents that will readily
identify receptors for which there are no ligands (orphan receptors) and
 which have low densities in the brain.\n4.\tAutomated methods for
quantifying the low levels of bound ligands for quantifying receptors
that are sparsely scattered in the brain.\n5.\tNew cell lines that
express each of the known neurotransmitter receptors so that each cell
line will be homogeneous for one receptor.\n6.\tNew cell lines that
express each of the above receptors linked to some metabolic function
and\/or second messenger so that the functional consequences of receptor
 occupancy can be detected.\n7.\tHigh volume, inexpensive assay methods
for measuring both receptor occupancy and cellular response for each of
the receptor types.\n8.\tDevelop cell culture models for neurons,
including methods of purifying homogeneous populations of
non-transformed cells by, for example, developing markers to identify
neuronal cell types for use in characterizing cell-type-specific
signaling pathways which may be useful in tracking the effects of
various drugs.\n9.\tDevelop techniques for either activating or
deactivating specific ion channels, receptors and signal transduction
pathways.\n10.\tDevelop dynamic biochemical and imaging assays that
allow measurement of variables now obtained only through
electrophysiological techniques.\n11.\tDevelop tools to facilitate
proteomic analysis of CNS neurons.\n12.\tDevelop tools to facilitate in
vivo studies of protein-protein interaction, folding and aggregation.
These technologies could impact our understanding of the basic
neurotransmitter receptors chemistry and on developing of more selective
 small chemical entities with high affinities for CNS targets.\n13.\tNew
 approaches to study the multiple functions of particular
proteins.\n14.\tTools to study post-translational changes in proteins
(expression levels, post-translational modifications, etc.) in specified
 tissue compartments and subcellular domains.\n15.\tTechnologies to
study functional entities within cells (e.g., green fluorescent protein
approaches) and subcellular compartments.\n16.\tTools and approaches to
study coordinate changes in genes and their functional relationship to
phenotypes, including phenotypes associated with specific brain
disorders.\n17.\t\tNovel tools and approaches to study protein-protein
interactions, especially those with phosphoproteins. Further develop
methods and reagents for studying the structures of membrane proteins at
 atomic resolution. Membrane protein systems that are of particular
interest to NIMH include proteins involved in normal function and
pathology of cells (neurons and glia) in the central and peripheral
nervous system.\n18.\tDevelop novel techniques for isolating and
identifying the structure of brain-derived membrane proteins.\n19.\tNew
methods to identify peptide receptors for which traditional biochemical
approaches (e.g.: radiolabeling techniques) failed to produce results.
This would be relevant for the development of small molecular probes
that would target peptide systems that might be altered in mental
disorders.\n20.\tDevelopment of new and optimization of the existing
methods for non-invasive quantitative detection of hormones and hormone
action in awake behaving animals.\n21.\tDevelopment of novel
technologies to adapt human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to
identify molecular and cellular dysfunction underlying mental illness
and for high throughput screening assays for candidate
therapeutics.\n22.\tContinuing to improve optogenetic techniques
(combining optical and genetic techniques to probe neural circuits
within intact animals).\nF.\tGenetic and Transgenic Technology. Advances
 in genetic and transgenic technologies offer many opportunities to
probe fundamental questions about the brain, behavior and pathology.
NIMH is broadly interested in these areas; some examples of topics
relevant to the mission of this Institute include, but are not limited
to:\n1.\tMethods to perform site-directed mutagenesis in cell lines for
the study of membrane proteins such as ion channels and neurotransmitter
 receptors.\n2.\tDevelopment of gene \u201cknockout\u201d or
\u201cknockin\u201d animals using such approaches as homologous
recombination targeting genes important in neurotransmission,
development, and tropic interactions as well as models relevant to
psychiatric disease.\n3.\tNew methods to delete or alter targeted genes
in the preparation of transgenic animals including methods that increase
 or decrease gene expression.\n4.\tDevelopment of new techniques and
apparatus for delivery of synthetic nucleic acids to manipulate
endogenous gene expression in specific cell populations and\/or brain
regions.\n5.\tDevelop and validate standardized behavioral tests and
apparatuses to assess the gene knockouts and\/or gene
\u201cknockins\u201d affecting neurotransmission.\n6.\tNew approaches
for spatially and\/or temporally restricted gene activation and\/or
inactivation.\n7.\tDevelop novel markers for elucidating how signaling
cascades impact DNA transcription.\n8.\tNew ways to assess
quantitatively transcription of genes in real time in a manner that is
minimally injurious to cells (e.g., non-permeabilizing
approaches).\n9.\tDevelop new technologies to study gene function and
expression, including approaches to studying gene and protein expression
 at single cell resolution.\n10.\tDevelop novel approaches to study the
expression characteristics of non-coding (nc) RNA molecules as well as
developing methodologies using nc-RNAs to manipulate gene expression in
cells and tissues of the nervous system.\n11.\tDevelopment of embryonic
stem (ES) cell lines from rodent strains (rats and mice) of relevance to
 behavioral research.\n12.\tDevelopment of technologies and approaches
to facilitate the collection and distribution of ES cell lines
containing mutations of potential relevance to behavioral and neural
processes relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders.\n13.\tDevelop methods
for long-term storage of transgenic germ cell lines.\n14.\tDevelop
technologies and approaches to aid in the renewal of founder colonies of
 transgenic mice from repositories of transgenic germ cell
lines.\n15.\tDevelop databases on neurobiological transgenic animals
produced to date, including information such as the origin of the
transgenic animal, key features of the biological and behavioral mutant,
 availability and location of germ cell lines, and existence of breeding
 colonies.\n16.\tDevelop gene transfer technologies such as viral
vectors and non-viral (e.g. polymer-based) systems to produce long-term,
 stable gene expression in the brain.\n17.\tDevelop methods to analyze
and manipulate DNA structure to study epigenetic modifications and
chromatin remodeling in brain tissue and neuronal
populations.\n18.\tDevelopment of selective gene silencing strategies to
 ablate neurons in one circuitry in order to examine its specific
behavioral consequences.\n19.\tTechnology development in
epigenetics:\na) development of novel and highly accurate tools to
analyze proteomics of histones\nb) development of antibodies for
immunochemical studies of histone modifications that selectively target a
 specific DNA modification site\nc) develop and apply tools for
epigenetic research to determine how, when, and where experience affects
 gene expression.\n20.\tTechnology development in Microbiome research:
a) development of tools for high throughput genomic analysis of human
microbiome; b) development of informatics tools to study the huge amount
 data that will result from these studies; and c) development of methods
 to determine the interaction between microbial community genes and host
 genetics as a potential contributing factor for mental
disorders.\nG.\tNeuroimmunology. Research on the interplay between the
brain, neuroendocrine system, and, immune system has revealed important
links between these major homeostatic system components. Examples of
NIMH-relevant topics in this area include, but are not limited
to:\n1.\tDevelopment of new tools to explore the specific properties of
the blood-brain barrier responsible for the selective delivery or
retention of cytokines, immune cells, and drugs affecting immune
activity in the brain.\n2.\tDevelopment of assays for identifying
potential autoimmune components of psychiatric
disorders.\n3.\tIdentification of critical molecules, processes, and
pathways mediating signals from the peripheral immune system to the
brain.\n4.\tDevelopment of novel cytokine ligands and antagonists, and
neuroimaging agents.\nH.\tPharmacology. Pharmacological intervention
represents a major force in the treatment of mental illness, and NIMH is
 interested in supporting research and development in this area.
However, pharmacologic agents that primarily act on molecular targets
which replicate those of currently-marketed pharmaceuticals used in the
treatment of mental disorders would not be of interest for this program.
 Relevant pharmacology topics include, but are not limited to:\n1.\tNew
chemical entities with high, selective affinities for CNS targets.
Examples include, but are not limited to, receptors, transporters, ion
channels, enzymes, kinases, or second or third messenger
systems.\n2.\tMethods to evaluate old and new chemical entities
(including complex mixtures of crude extracts from natural products) for
 possible therapeutic usefulness using \u201cin vitro\u201d and \u201cin
 vivo\u201d assays and model systems.\n3.\tMethods for extraction,
fractionalization, and isolation of active compounds from natural
products. Water-soluble compounds are of particular interest due to the
difficulty of the procedures.\n4.\tComputer algorithms that model
receptors to evaluate theoretical permutations of known molecules to
find the molecule with the maximum probability of having the highest
affinity for a specific receptor as well as those that have the
potential for the most desirable \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d
rates.\n5.\tComputer models of the blood brain barrier and evaluate
potential and actual drug molecules for their ability to cross or
penetrate this barrier.\n6.\tStrategies for evaluating pharmacological
agents (e.g., animal behavioral testing, computer simulation) within
specific domains of cognitive function.\n7.\tBehavioral
\u201cmodels\u201d similar in animals and humans; behavioral
pharmacological effects that may serve as \u201csurrogate\u201d markers
in humans.\n8.\tDevelopment of models for evaluating drug effects within
 functional brain circuits relevant to mental
disorders.\n9.\tDevelopment of novel drug delivery systems.\n10.\tTools
for Drug Development including neuroimaging (e.g., radiolabeled
compounds) and development of animal models.\n11.\tPharmacological
profiling (in vitro and in vivo) for potential therapeutic
drugs.\n12.\tMethods for evaluation of long-term effects of psychotropic
 drug administration in animal models or human subjects. If clinical
populations are being tested, the technology would be appropriate for
either the Division of Developmental Translational Research (DDTR) or
the Division of Adult Translation Research (DATR) at NIMH.
\n13.\tImproving existing, and developing new, vectors for delivery of
genes to the brain.\n14.\tDevelopment of novel therapeutic approaches
targeting gene expression through effects on promoter activity or
epigenetic mechanisms.\n15.\tDevelopment of novel high throughput
screening (HTS) assays for drug development. Examples include, but are
not limited to, in vitro functional assays, toxicology screens,
blood-brain barrier permeability assays, and circuit based or behavioral
 assays.\n16.\tDevelopment of novel molecular targets for drug
development to treat mental illnesses.\nI.\tTract Tracing Methods and
Tools. Little is known about the details of the connectivity of the
human nervous system, because the best tract tracing techniques are
invasive and require the deposit of substances in vivo. Methods that
would be applicable to post-mortem tissue would allow significant
progress in connectional studies of human tissue, as well as non-human
tissue, particularly with regard to the development of c, quantu
onnections and the connections of structures not easily accessed in
vivo. Examples include the development of improved physical, chemical
and\/or biological markers for neuroanatomical tract-tracing (e.g. m
dots, caged molecules, viral delivery agents, etc.).\nJ.\t\tEducational
Tools. Neuroscience, basic behavioral science and human genetics are
compelling areas of science that not only touch upon a diverse array of
disciplines, but also provide insights to the essence of what it is to
be human. Products aimed at teaching the substance of these fields to
students of all ages would be useful in disseminating this information
and these insights. Examples include, but are not limited to: software
and other interactive media used to convey fundamental concepts about
the brain to children; computer simulations of neuroscience experiments;
 updateable media that presents state-of-the-art information on
particular topics for use by experts; website or other online,
interactive electronic vehicle to allow for sharing of information about
 the brain and its functions, including technologies for holding
interactive research conferences related to basic behavioral sciences,
basic neuroscience, or clinical neuroscience.\nK.\tNeuroinformatics.
Data generated by brain research are diverse, vast, and complex. The
diversity of data is due to the fact that neuroscience data are obtained
 from: theoretical, experimental and clinical approaches; from levels of
 biological organization that span molecules to populations of
individuals and from single-cell organisms to humans; and from states of
 health, disease, and models of disease. The quantity of data in brain
research is the result of tens of thousands of neuroscience laboratories
 working around the world. The complexity of data reflects the high
level of interconnectedness of the data, and their high dimensionality.
Neuroinformatics is a new area of science that draws upon neuroscience,
information science, computer science, statistics, applied mathematics,
and a variety of engineering fields to develop tools that will let
neuroscientists make better sense and use of their data. These tools
include software and hardware for digital data acquisition,
visualization, analysis, integration, and sharing (e.g., through tools
for electronic scientific collaboration). Such tools can address data of
 any type or from any area of neuroscience; examples include, but are
not limited to:\n1.\tDatabases, querying approaches, and information
retrieval tools for neuroscience and neuroscience-related data. An
example would be the development of a web-based database for sharing,
analyzing and comparing the pharmacological responses of a variety of
CNS active compounds in preclinical studies relevant to mental
health.\n2.\tTools for neuroscience data visualization (and other forms
of presentation) and manipulation (probabilistic atlases of brain
structure or function, new statistical approaches for analyzing data,
etc.).\n3.\tSoftware for integration and synthesis of neuroscience data
(computational models of neurons to integrate data about structure and
function, environments to merge data from multiple imaging modalities,
etc.).\n4.\tTools for electronic collaboration to allow neuroscientists
to interact with colleagues, data, and instruments at a distance (this
could include novel types of \u201cgroupware\u201d, etc.).\n5.\tTools
that bridge existing neuroscience and biology information tools and
resources, such as databases and informatics tools associated with
genome mapping efforts.\nFor further information on basic neuroscience

 Translational Research\nThe Division of Developmental Translational
Research directs, plans, and supports programs of research and research
training leading to the prevention and cure of childhood
psychopathology. This long-term goal will be accomplished through an
integrated program of research across behavioral\/psychological
processes, brain development, environment and genetics. The topics
listed below reflect the NIMH interest in technologies related to this
research area, but should not be considered a complete list. Prospective
 applicants are strongly encouraged to contact Dr. Margaret Grabb
(listed below) with questions about the relevance of their interests to
the mission of this division.\nA.\tTechnologies for Clinical Pediatric
Research. It is important to develop reliable methods that can correctly
 identify the normal and abnormal components of cognitive, emotional,
and psychosocial behavior, as well as normal and abnormal physiological
and biochemical functions, in human development. Computer-based methods
of accomplishing this are also needed to increase the accessibility and
reliability of information made available to the research community.
Examples include:\n1.\tMeasurements of Alterations in Pediatric
Development in Patients with Mental Health Disorders Using Physiological
 and Behavioral Measures.  Research studies indicate that some mental
health disorders, such as autism, may begin to develop as early as
infancy. Therefore non-invasive modern equipment that use the most
recent technological advances are needed to isolate specific
physiological and behavioral changes during development, to identify
potential diagnostic markers of mental health disorders. A priority for
this program is to support research and development of hardware and
software tools to measure pediatric development. Examples of
technologies needed include: \na.\tPsychophysiological measures to
evaluate infants, children or adolescents.\nb.\tMiniaturized
non-invasive instruments to record psychophysiological data (e.g., heart
 and respiration rate, galvanic skin response, and defensive motor
behavior).\nc.\tTelemetry capability for non-invasive devices so that
children can be monitored for prolonged periods without interfering with
 their behavior.\nd.\tComputer programs and inexpensive computers that
will collect, analyze and identify recurring patterns in the
psychophysiological measure(s) of interest.\n2.\tPediatric Assessment
Tool.  Diagnosis of mental health disorders in children and adolescents
is vital to providing early interventions to treat the disorder. In
addition, a better understanding of the concept of functioning in
psychopathology, and its appropriate measurement, is needed in pediatric
 populations. In the future, diagnostic tools may even help detect the
initial onset of illness in children at risk, before symptoms occur. A
priority for this program is to develop novel diagnostic tools to detect
 mental health disorders in children and adolescents. Of particular
interest to this division are methods that can be used with children and
 adolescents with limited verbal communication (i.e., very young or
developmentally disabled). Biochemical, genetic, physiological and
psychological tool development is welcomed. \na.\tTechnologies to assess
 CNS effects of psychosocial or pharmacological
interventions.\nb.\tDevelopment of reliable and stable
biomarkers\/biosignatures that can identify at-risk individuals prior to
 disease onset, biological and behavioral indicators or predictors of
treatment response, measures of disease progression, measures to
identify dose ranges prior to clinical studies, preclinical or clinical
efficacy testing, toxicity measures for drug development, defining
patients to enroll in the clinical study, identifying CNS abnormalities,
 etc.\nc.\tAssessment tools for pediatric mental health disorders that
are sensitive to developmental change, gender and cultural diversity,
variation in cognitive and behavioral functioning, hearing and\/or
speech impairment, and co-morbid disorders.\nd.\tInnovative approaches
to assessing mental disorders using new statistical and psychometric
techniques such as Item Response Theory.\ne.\tComputerized methodologies
 for assessing various mental disorders suitable for use in primary care
 settings, e.g. they would need to function rapidly and
reliably.\nf.\tBiological and behavioral measures to define and assess
specific impairment-related components of psychiatric disorders, e.g.,
cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia.\ng.\tDevelopment of valid and
reliable measures that operationalize functioning within and across
developmental periods, and that can be used in a variety of service
settings. Such measures can lead to more accurate diagnoses, a better
understanding of the impact of psychiatric disorders, and better
tracking of treatment effectiveness.\n3.\tBehavior Monitoring and
Analysis of Pediatric Mental Health Disorders.\na.\tImprove or create
new video devices to monitor human behavior and ease analysis of
behavior.\nb.\tComputer software to ease analysis of behavior monitored
by video or telemetry systems.\nc.\tAutomated methods to detect specific
 emotional states using behavioral and autonomic indicators: This
Division is specifically interested in technologies that can identify
children with heightened or dampened emotional states that could be
associated with particular mental health disorders, including children
with limited verbal skills (i.e., very young or developmentally
disabled). If the technology will primarily be used to investigate basic
 mechanisms of behavior, the Division of Neuroscience and Basic
Behavioral Science at NIMH would be the most appropriate division to
contact.\n4.\tIntervention Development for Childhood-Onset Mental
Disorders.\na.\tStrategies (e.g., animal behavioral testing, computer
simulation) for evaluating, in early developmental periods, the effects
of pharmacological agents on specific functional domains and brain
circuits associated with mental disorders.\nb.\tStrategies (e.g., animal
 behavioral testing, computer simulation) for evaluating, in early
developmental periods, the effects of cognitive or behavioral
interventions (e.g., cognitive rehabilitation, attention training) or
device-based protocols (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation or
direct current stimulation) on specific functional domains and brain
circuits associated with mental disorders.\nc.\tMethods for evaluation
of long-term effects of psychotherapeutic drug administration or brain
stimulation protocols in developmental animal
models.\n5.\tMethodological Research and Development. There is a need to
 devise new ways of data collection, analysis, management and
dissemination. Examples include:\na.\tTechnologies that use the most
recent technological advances to identify aberrations in the CNS during
development, associated with mental disorders. Once these aberrations
are identified and localized, rational therapies can be developed and
evaluated.\nb.\tInnovative, computer-based methods to monitor preventive
 and treatment intervention efforts and correlate them with outcome
measures are needed. Results should be accessible to other interested
parties without compromising the privacy of the individual.
\nc.\tDevelopment of innovative software for addressing the integration
of distributed cross-disciplinary data sources into coherent knowledge
bases. The data should focus on pediatric mental health
disorders.\nd.\tComputer-based intervention development for parents or
for school settings.\ne.\tDevelopment of databases containing detailed
genetic and behavioral information on pediatric populations and their
families, as resources for the field in investigations of gene x
environment interactions.\nf.\tMathematical, statistical and computer
algorithms that could be used to analyze large and\/or complex data
sets. Examples of these data sets include those derived from functional
imaging studies. Among other applications, these could be used to
segment images such as those obtained from magnetic resonance imagers,
filter noise, visualize data or search vast data sets for specified
patterns or data (e.g., use of pattern recognition algorithms to search
time series data sets obtained from electrophysiological recording of
neural activity, or video data obtained from behavioral analysis of
genetically altered animals). Improved techniques for path analysis when
 examining functional imaging datasets would also be of
interest.\nB.\tChild and Adolescent Treatment and Preventive
Intervention Research.  An estimated one in ten children and adolescents
 in the United States suffers from mental illness severe enough to cause
 some level of impairment. Yet, it remains unclear what treatments are
the best and safest for these developing age groups. A priority for this
 program is to support research and development of novel
psychopharmacological or psychosocial approaches for the treatment and
prevention of mental illness in childhood and adolescence, in subjects
aged 18 and below. \n\tThe goal of this research is broad and inclusive
with respect to the heterogeneity of patients, the severity and
chronicity of disorders, and the range of outcomes measured. Disorders
studied include all mental and behavioral disorders. Interventions
studied include pharmacologic approaches (individual and combination
medications), somatic approaches, behavioral and psychotherapeutic
approaches. Research is supported on individual and combined approaches.
 Research that translates findings on basic physiological or behavioral
processes into novel preventive or treatment interventions is especially
 encouraged. Effectiveness studies that focus on interventions of known
efficacy are assigned to the Division of Services and Intervention
Research.\n\tHuman subjects include child and adolescent age groups
covering the full range of mental disorders individually and in complex
patterns of comorbidity with other mental disorders and behavioral
problems (e.g., anxiety and depression) and substance abuse (e.g.,
depression and alcohol abuse).\n1.\tPharmacologic Treatment
Intervention. Clinical testing of novel mechanism therapeutics is the
principle aim of this technology development section. This includes
Phase IIa and proof of concept studies in pediatric subjects. It is
expected the pharmacologic agents selected for these studies be
IND-ready and based on novel molecular targets identified through basic
and clinical research, preclinical research and animal model research
relevant to understanding developmental aspects of mental
illness.\n2.\tCombined Intervention. Areas include all research that
combines different treatment modalities in a single combined or
comparative protocol (e.g., pharmacologic plus psychosocial
intervention). \n3.\tPsychosocial Intervention. Areas include
development and application of new psychotherapeutic, behavioral, and
psychosocial treatments, based on the latest advances in development
neuroscience.\n4.\tPreventive Intervention Program. Areas include
preventive intervention studies in which efficacy has not been
demonstrated, including those designed to reduce the risk of onset or
delay onset of mental disorders, dysfunctions and related problems
within asymptomatic and subclinical populations and those related to
treatment (e.g., prevention of relapse, recurrence) or side effects
(prevention\/ minimization of tardive dyskinesia, etc.). Prevention
studies that focus on behavioral problems, without a focus on a specific
 mental health disorder or a specific domain of function that
significantly impacts a mental health disorder (e.g. cognitive function)
 should contact NICHD. \n5. \tDevelopment and Maintenance of Clinical
Trial Networks. Areas include the development of hardware\/software to
facilitate research collaborations in conducting clinical trials,
technologies to facilitate data sharing, merging of multiple data sets,
and the development and maintenance of common protocols across research
sites working on a common pediatric preventive or treatment
intervention.\nC.\tScience Education in Mental Disorders.  There is a
critical need for improvement in science education, particularly in
areas specifically related to brain, behavior and mental illness.
Examples include:\n1.\tResearch on the best ways to present neuroscience
 and behavioral science information, in the context of mental health
disorders, to particular groups of students (e.g., kindergarten through
sixth grade).\n2.\tComputer-based systems to teach students how to
observe scientific phenomena related to the brain, behavior and mental
illness, and to report them clearly in writing.\n3.\tResearch on better
ways to communicate new knowledge and directions of scientific growth in
 the area of neuroscience and mental illness to teachers and curriculum
developers.\nFor further information on Developmental Translational

Treatment Development (DATR)\nThe DATR is responsible for planning,
directing and supporting programs of research, research training,
research dissemination and resource development aimed at understanding
the pathophysiology of mental illness and hastening the translation of
behavioral science and neuroscience advances into innovations in
clinical care. The Division supports a broad portfolio of pre-clinical
and human clinical studies that focus on the phenotypic characterization
 and risk factors for major psychiatric disorders. In addition , the
Division studies psychiatric disorders of late life. The division is
comprised of four branches. These branches are: The Adult
Psychopathology and Psychosocial Intervention Research Branch, The
Clinical Neuroscience Research Branch, the Geriatrics Research Branch
and the Experimental Therapeutics Branch. This division also includes a
program on Traumatic Stress Disorders Research. Their respective
functions are as follows:\nAdult Psychopathology and Psychosocial
Intervention Research Branch. This branch promotes the integration of
basic behavioral and neuroscience findings into translational research
on the foundations of psychopathology and functional disability. The
branch targets new science based assessment, prevention, treatment and
rehabilitation practices including research on causal risk and
protective factors for mental disorders, mechanisms that convert
vulnerability into psychiatric symptoms and disability and use of modern
 psychometric and statistical theories to advance nosology and
assessment. Other specific areas of emphasis include mood, eating
disorders, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia.\nClinical Neuroscience
Branch. The focus of this branch is on the understanding of the neural
basis of mental disorders. Human and animal studies are supported on the
 molecular, cellular and systems level of brain function designed to
elucidate the pathophysiology of mental disease and to translate these
findings to clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention. These
approaches are applied to the spectrum of mental disorders including
schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder and other
brain disorders. Areas of emphasis include: identification of valid and
unique neurophysiological markers or complexes of markers for the major
mental disorders and development of animal and or computational models
that accurately mimic complex neurophysiology or behaviors
characteristic of mental illness.\nGeriatrics Research Branch. This
branch focuses on research and resource development in the etiology,
pathophysiology and course of mental disorders of late life as well as
in the treatment and rehabilitation of persons with these disorders.
Disorders studied include mood, anxiety and personality disorders,
psychotic disorders and schizophrenia, psychiatric syndromes and
behavioral disorders in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and related dementias,
suicide, and eating disorders. Selected areas of emphasis include:
development of more reliable and valid phenotypes, assessments and
biological and behavioral markers for late-life mental disorders;
development of improved treatment and preventive intervention techniques
 for use in geriatric care settings; and identification of genetic,
brain imaging and other predictors of variability in older adults\u2019
treatment response.\nExperimental Therapeutics Branch. This branch
supports multidisciplinary research on novel pharmacological approaches
to the treatment of mental disorders, evaluation of existing treatments
of mental disorders, development and assessment of putative biomarkers
of psychiatric disease and treatment response and development and
testing of novel treatments. Studies supported include early phase
clinical studies of new medications, studies to predict treatment
response and studies to validate biomarkers or predictors of therapeutic
 response to pharmacological intervention. Side effects of therapeutic
agents are also given emphasis. \nTraumatic Stress Disorders Research
Program. This program supports integrating basic behavioral and
neuroscience findings into translational research on psychopathology
associated with trauma exposure. Areas of emphasis include developing
disorder and risk assessment tools based on individual differences, the
development of treatment and preventive interventions for posttraumatic
disorders, and identifying mechanisms of therapies and mechanisms of
disorder that are impacted by therapies. This program also supports a
broader continuum of research (basic science, clinical practice, and
health care system factors) focused on the mental health consequences of
 mass trauma and violence (e.g. war, terrorism, natural and
technological disaster), including interventions and service delivery in
 children, adolescents, and adults impacted by mass trauma.\nAll
applications relevant to the mission of the Division of Adult

Research\nThe Division of Services and Interventions Research supports
research, research demonstrations, research training, resource
development, and research dissemination in prevention and treatment
interventions, services research, clinical epidemiology, and diagnostic
and disability assessment. The division is composed of three branches:
Services Research and Clinical Epidemiology Branch, Adult Treatment and
Preventive Intervention Research Branch, and Child and Adolescent
Treatment and Preventive Intervention Research Branch. \nThe Division
supports two critical areas of research:\n\u2022\tIntervention research
to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacologic, psychosocial
(psychotherapeutic and behavioral), somatic, rehabilitative and
combination interventions on mental and behavior disorders-including
acute and longer-term therapeutic effects on functioning across domains
(such as school, family, peer functioning) for children, adolescents and
 adults.\n\u2022\tMental health services research\nThe interventions
focus is broad and inclusive with respect to the heterogeneity of
patients, the severity and chronicity of disorders, and the variety of
community and institutional settings in which treatment is provided. It
includes clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of known
efficacious interventions, as well as studies evaluating modified or
adapted forms of interventions for use with additional populations (such
 as women, ethnic and racial groups), new settings (public sector,
pediatric primary care, schools, other non-academic settings,
communities at large) and people with co-occurring disorders. Other foci
 include: identifying subgroups who may be more likely to benefit from
treatment, evaluating the combined or sequential use of interventions
(such as to extend effect among refractory subgroups), determining the
optimal length of intervention, establishing the utility of continuation
 or maintenance treatment (that is, for prevention of relapse or
recurrence), and evaluating the long-term impact of efficacious
interventions on symptoms and functioning. \nServices research covers
all mental health services research issues, across the lifespan and
disorders, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\tServices
organization, delivery (process and receipt of care), and related health
 economics at the individual, clinical, program, community and systems
levels in specialty mental health, general health, and other delivery
settings (such as the workplace).\n\u2022\tInterventions to improve the
quality and outcomes of care (including diagnostic, treatment,
preventive, and rehabilitation services.\n\u2022\tEnhanced capacity for
conducting services research\n\u2022\tThe clinical epidemiology of
mental disorders across all clinical and service settings.\nThe Division
 also provides biostatistical analysis and clinical trials operations
expertise for research studies; analyzes and evaluates national mental
health needs and community research partnership opportunities; and
supports research on health disparities.\nThe priorities for 2011 should
 focus on technologies that advance the scientific opportunities and
recommendations of \u201cThe Road Ahead: Research Partnerships to
Transform Services, A Report by the National Advisory Mental Health
Council\u2019s Workgroups on Services and Clinical Epidemiology
Research.\u201d \u201cThe Road Ahead: Research Partnerships to Transform
 Services, A Report by the National Advisory Mental Health
Council\u2019s Workgroups on Services and Clinical Epidemiology
Research,\u201d and the NIMH Strategic Plan. Examples are listed
below:\n1.\tClinical Trials Methodologies: The development, testing and
refinement of methodologies, instruments and statistical approaches to
facilitate collaborative clinical trials for the prevention, treatment
and rehabilitation of individuals with mental disorders; the development
 of innovative trials design (e.g., fixed adaptive, encouragement,
partially randomized preference) the application of modern technology to
 enhance the science, operation, and management of multi-site mental
health clinical trials; and the development of mental health clinical
trial archives. The development of portable clinical trial management
systems such as serious adverse event (SAE) oversight and monitoring
software. Adaptation of existing clinical trial methodologies to study
mental health disorders. Development of common data elements to enhance
uniformity across clinical trials with and amongst
disorders.\n2.\tScience Training and Education: SBIR applications must
focus on DSIR\u2019s research priorities. Develop, modify and test new
and existing technologies, strategies and approaches to: (1) enhance
science and research training across the educational\/ career pipeline;
(2) improve scientific literacy for clinicians and service\/
organizational providers; (3) encourage entry and retention of
individuals with non-mental health science backgrounds (engineers,
computer scientists, medical anthropologists, law, business) or
perspectives (individuals from under-represented communities) into the
mental health services and interventions field; (4) keep established
researchers and practitioners up-to-date on the findings,
implementation, and methods of services and interventions research; and
(5) facilitate participatory research with individuals, families and
communities. This can include the development of science\/ research
education materials, curriculum, methodologies and web-based programs
relevant to the mission of the division; the development of networking
and collaborative approaches to research training in mental health
interventions and services research; and the development of multi-media
approaches (combined with traditional strategies) to improve the level
of scientific and career mentoring that mental health services and
interventions researchers receive. \n3.\tPublic Health Oriented
Pharmacoeconomics: Develop and test simulation models for estimating the
 amount of total out-of-pocket expenditures (co-payments) for the most
frequently prescribed psychotropic drugs under different insurance
benefit scenarios and\/or under different pharmacy benefit management
scenarios. Models should also be developed to accommodate common
combined pharmaceutical approaches. \n4.\tDissemination: Development of
technological approaches to increase the sustainable uptake of
scientifically based treatments and services across diverse community
settings. This could include web-based interactive tools for
state\/county mental health or related (e.g., schools) agencies around
implementation of evidence-based practices. Development of innovative
ways (e.g., new technology, use of multi-media) of disseminating
information to stakeholders. Development of new approaches to the
dissemination and implementation of evidence based mental health
interventions to underserved populations (e.g., rural\/frontier, aging
individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders). Development of technology
to enhance conduct of clinical trials and the dissemination of their
results.\n5.\tImplementation: Application of new technologies,
approaches and strategies to identify and utilize active therapeutic
ingredients in complex community-based services and programs that
optimize functioning and sustain community reintegration of people with
mental disorders. Use of technologies and strategies to assist service
systems to more adequately plan for transitions (e.g., child to adult
system, prison to community) and seamlessly integrate mentally ill
individuals moving between these sectors.\n6.\tMerging Multiple Data
Sets: Merging multiple data sets (e.g., claims, trials, pharmacy etc.)
for innovative and complex analytic strategies.\n7.\tCommunity Outreach
to Diverse and Underserved Populations: Application of new technologies
and strategies to develop, test, and refine culturally appropriate
materials and approaches to: foster help-seeking and engagement of
diverse and underserved populations in research-based mental health
treatment and prevention; to foster participation in community based
research by diverse and underserved populations; and to inform diverse
provider groups about state-of-the-art mental health treatments and
services in order to facilitate their implementation of these
interventions.\n8.\tComputerized Methodologies for Mental Health
Services Research: Applications need to focus on computerized methods to
 assess mental disorders in primary care settings including screening
devices for identifying mental disorders across the life-span;
development of computer software and hardware that allow conducting
computer assisted interviews with severely mentally ill people for
research purposes to obtain information on their quality of care; design
 work to move assessment as rapidly as possible to computerized adaptive
 testing (CAT); apply audio and video technologies to assess
patient\u2019s treatment preferences.\nA.\tServices Research and
Clinical Epidemiology Branch. The branch supports research on the
organization, financing, delivery, effectiveness, and appropriateness of
 mental health care in everyday settings in order to find ways to
improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of mental health
services (including preventive services) in community and other
settings. Also supported are studies on pharmacoeconomics,
pharmaco-epidemiology, and the distribution, determinants, and course of
 mental illness in the context of various clinical settings. Mental
health services include mental health care provided in specialty mental
health and general health care settings, including primary care,
hospitals, nursing homes, and other residential care settings, as well
as in educational settings and various legal system settings, such as
jails, juvenile detention and correctional facilities, prisons, and
probation and parole programs. Other services often needed by mentally
ill persons include social services, vocational and rehabilitation
services, welfare, and housing. Relevant services include those provided
 to children and adolescents with emotional disorders, adults and
elderly adults with mental disorders, and persons with mental illness
that co-occurs with physical illness and with alcohol and\/or drug abuse
 disorder. Research methodologies include ethnographic studies, surveys,
 and analyses of secondary data, randomized controlled trials,
quasi-experimental designs, cohort, and case-control
studies.\n\tAdvances in clinical epidemiology, mental health treatment
and services research fields have made it imperative that intensive work
 continue in the areas of assessment\/screening technologies, outcome
assessment measurement and measurement packages, dissemination
technologies, data analysis techniques, and the training of clinicians
and providers. The translation of efficacious and effective treatments
into primary care, community mental health centers, and managed care
settings is both a major challenge and opportunity to develop
technologies and systems that will improve the care and rehabilitation
of patients and enable them to profit from the research advances that
have been made. Research is needed on the dissemination of empirically
supported treatments or services.\n1.\tMethodological Research Program.
Supports studies that involve development, testing, and refinement of
methodologies and instruments to facilitate research on services for
mentally ill persons, including measures of severity of illness, family
burden, social support, quality of care, effectiveness of care, direct
and indirect cost of mental disorders, and short-term and long-term
outcome measures; studies submitted by statisticians, psychometricians,
and other experts in research methodology and scientific data analysis
for work on the design, measurement, and statistical challenges inherent
 in conducting mental health services research.\n2.\tOutcomes and
Quality of Care Research. This program is concerned with strengthening
the theoretical and empirical base for mental health services research
by including approaches that derive from sociology, anthropology, and

across special population groups such as racial and ethnic groups, as
well as women and children, and persons living in rural and frontier
areas. The program addresses care delivered in a variety of settings
such as the specialty mental health sector, the general medical sector,
and community settings (such as schools). Also, it supports research
that examines innovative services interventions (such as community-based
 participatory methods, faith-based) to overcome mental health
disparities related to mental health service delivery and
use.\n5.\tSociocultural Research Program. Is concerned with
strengthening the theoretical and empirical base for mental health
services research by including approaches that derive from sociology,
anthropology, and the behavioral sciences in general. The program

coverage and mental health insurance parity on access, cost, and
quality; cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of
mental health service interventions; and economic analysis of practice
patterns of different mental health providers. The goal of the program
is to expand understanding of the role of economic factors in the
delivery and use of mental health services and assist in the development
 of improved mental health financing methods promoting high quality,
cost-effective care for people suffering from mental disorders.
\n8.\tPrimary Care Research. Includes studies on the delivery and
effectiveness of mental health services within the general health care
sector; recognition, diagnosis, management, and treatment of mental and
emotional problems by primary care providers; coordination of general

to the development of a sound knowledge base on the effective
transmission of mental health information to multiple stakeholders and
of the process by which efficacious interventions can be adopted within
clinical settings. Research on dissemination will address how
information about mental health care interventions is created, packaged,
 transmitted, and interpreted among a variety of important stakeholder
groups. Research on implementation will address the level to which
mental health interventions can fit within real-world service systems.
Related topics include multilevel decision-making perspectives about
services and interventions in community settings, with special focus on
translating behavioral science into applied research in these areas.

        "description": "The mission of the National Institute on
Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) is to promote minority
health and to lead, coordinate, support, and assess the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) effort to reduce and ultimately eliminate
health disparities. In this effort, the NIMHD conducts and supports
basic, clinical, social and behavioral research, facilitates the
development of research infrastructure and training, fosters emerging
programs, and reaches out to racial\/ethnic minority and other health
disparity communities. \nNIMHD particularly serves as the focal point
for targeted, hypothesis-driven, patient-oriented research and targeted
applied, outcomes- and problem-driven studies that meet at least two of
three criteria: (1) participating health disparity population(s) is\/are
 over sampled; (2) the participating health disparity population(s)
is\/are specifically targeted with or without within-group comparisons;
and\/or (3) the research focus is within the scope of NIMHD programmatic
 interests. NIMHD\u2019s programmatic interests include surveillance,
explanatory, and translational research in health disparity populations.
 Specific topics include health promotion and disease prevention and
intervention; pathogenic mechanisms underlying escalations in the
susceptibility to disease and illness; and health services research -
the impact of socioeconomic, cultural, and other environmental factors
on health outcomes. \nPROGRAM AREAS OF INTEREST\nSummary\nPriority
Populations:  Minorities, Low-Income, and Rural\nDiseases where
significant health disparities exist:  Infant Mortality, Obesity,
Depression, Cancer, Heart Disease, Diabetes, Sexually Transmitted
Infections, and HIV\/AIDS\nInterventions that address:  Behavioral
Change, Prevention, Social Determinants of Health, and Health
Literacy\nApplications that are:  Transformational, Trans-disciplinary,
and Translational\nNatural History of Disparities in Health
Outcomes\nDisparities in health outcomes are believed to result from the
 interaction of a plethora of interactive factors such as environmental
exposures and genetic traits, and\/or the accrual over time of stable
phenotypic traits and lifestyle behaviors that contribute to but are
insufficient individually to cause the onset of disease or illness. The
etiology of disparities in health outcomes with particular emphasis on
identifying and deconstructing the array of interactive risk
factors\u2014environmental, socioeconomic, stereotyping, bias, clinical
uncertainty, and gene-related factors\u2014that contribute to
escalations in the susceptibility to disease and illness and may
contribute to health disparities. Examples include, but are not limited
to: \n1.\tMultidisciplinary basic research approaches that lead to
biological probes and starting points for therapeutic interventions;
\n2.\tInnovative high throughput screening approaches to identify
compounds that are active in target- and phenotype assays and to use
these approaches to develop bioactive probes for application in vitro
and potentially in vivo studies;\n3.\tMethodological and technological
innovation that will integrate behavioral and social science with
biomedical research, including gene related and environmental
components.\n4.\tDifferential pharmacologic drug metabolism; and
\n5.\tImpact of dietary decision making in diverse populations and
effect on health disparity outcomes.\nHealth Promotion and Prevention
Research in the Health Disparities Communities\nHigh priority is given
to activities designed to empower health disparity communities to
achieve health equity through health education, disease prevention, and
partnering in community-based hypothesis, outcomes- and problem-driven
research. Examples of such activities include, but are not limited
to:\n6.\tEfficacy of therapies in local populations; \n7.\tMotivating
positive behavioral changes in diverse populations; \n8.\tHealth
outcomes related to health seeking, lifestyle, risk taking, protective
behaviors and\/or socioeconomic status; \n9.\tIncorporating research
into health promotion and disease prevention initiatives, applying new
knowledge in a culturally appropriate manner in intervention\/disease
prevention initiatives; and\n10.\tDistribution of health structures and
adverse health effects, and the sufficiency of healthcare frameworks in
accommodating diverse social, cultural, political and economic factors.
\nInnovations in Health Disparities Research\nStudies that promote and
advance evidence-based transformation in medical decision-making and
health policy; demonstration projects that implement evidence-based,
culturally sensitive intervention\/disease prevention therapies and
diagnostics; and activities designed to build capacity for health
disparities research are of high priority. Examples of such studies
include, but are not limited to: \n11.\tDevelopment of health disparity
group-specific methodologies and diagnostics; \n12.\tDevelopment of
technologies targeted for health disparity groups (i.e., gene chips,
other novel assay systems, animal models, specialized instruments,
etc.); and \n13.\tDemonstration projects that build capacity for health
disparities research (e.g., regional hospital-based registries for
disease areas of emphasis, etc.) or implement the
translation\/application of research results in a culturally sensitive
manner.\nFor additional information about the areas of interest to the

STROKE (NINDS)",
        "description": "The mission of NINDS is to reduce the burden of
neurological disease\u2014a burden borne by every age group, by every
segment of society, by people all over the world. To this end, the
Institute supports and conducts research on the healthy and diseased
brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Hundreds of disorders afflict
 the nervous system. Common disorders such as stroke, epilepsy,
Parkinson\u2019s disease, and autism are well-known. Many other
neurological disorders are rare and known only to the individuals and
families affected, their doctors, and scientists.\nThe NINDS SBIR\/STTR
program funds small business concerns to conduct innovative neuroscience
 research or neuroscience research and development (R\/R&amp;D) that has
 both the potential for commercialization and public benefit. NINDS is
committed to helping small business concerns commercialize their
technologies through its grant funding, technical assistance program
participation, and outreach at meetings. NINDS encourages all Phase II
applicants to apply to the NIH Commercialization Assistance Program
(CAP) to gain assistance in transferring their products to the
marketplace. The CAP program is open to all Phase II grants that were
active in the past six years. NINDS is increasingly tracking the
progress of its funded small business concerns and the products they
develop. Funding priority will be given to those small business concerns
 that show not only their ability to develop products but their growth
as a small business concern towards independence from the SBIR\/STTR
program.\nLIMITED AMOUNT OF AWARD\nFor budgetary, administrative, or
programmatic reasons, NINDS may decrease the length of an award and\/or
the budget recommended by a review committee, or not fund an
application. Generally, NINDS does not fund Phase I applications greater
 than $350,000 total cost per year for up to 2 years or Phase II
applications greater than $1,000,000 total cost per year for up to 3
years. Applicants considering a requested budget greater than these
limits are strongly encouraged to contact program staff before
submitting an application.\nPhase IIB Competing Renewal Awards\nIn
addition to the traditional Phase I and II applications, NINDS will
accept Phase IIB SBIR\/STTR Competing Renewal grant applications to
continue the process of developing products that require approval of a
federal regulatory agency. Such products include, but are not limited
to: medical implants, drugs, biologics, and new treatment or diagnostic
tools that require FDA approval.\nNINDS will accept applications for up
to three years that do not exceed $1,000,000 per year in total
costs.\nThe following examples would make appropriate topics for
proposed SBIR or STTR Phase IIB Competing Renewal projects. This list is
 not meant to be all-inclusive, and applications for other appropriate
activities will be accepted.\n1.\tStudies for preclinical discovery and
development of drugs to treat neurological disorders. Appropriate areas
of effort may include the following (but are not limited to): medicinal
chemistry structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies to develop drug
candidates, pharmacology studies aimed at evaluating the potential
therapeutic activity and side effect profile of drug candidates,
medicinal chemistry and pharmacology studies aimed at synthesizing and
evaluating compounds as potential drug leads and as preclinical drug
candidates, and studies aimed at evaluating drug metabolism and
pharmacokinetic behavior in rodents. These efforts should extend beyond
those conducted under the initial SBIR Phase I and Phase II grants. The
studies conducted under the previous grants should be sufficient to
provide a sound rationale for continued development.\n2.\tCompletion of
studies as required by the FDA for an IND application.\n3.\tSafety and
effectiveness studies of novel medical devices.\n4.\tHuman clinical
trials\/studies to determine the safety profile, metabolism, and\/or
efficacy of a drug.\nPlease contact Ms. Stephanie Fertig (contact
information provided below) before beginning the process of preparing an
 application. Prospective applicants are strongly encouraged to submit a
 letter of intent that includes the following information:
\n\u2022\tDescriptive title of the proposed research \n\u2022\tName,
address, and telephone number of the Principal Investigator
\n\u2022\tNames of other key personnel \n\u2022\tParticipating
institutions \n\u2022\tFunding Opportunity Announcement Number (e.g.,
PA-10-XXX) \nAlthough a letter of intent is not required, is not
binding, and does not enter into the review of a subsequent application,
 the information that it contains allows NIH staff to estimate the
potential review workload and plan the review. It is expected that only a
 portion of NINDS SBIR\/STTR Phase II awards will be eligible for a
Competing Renewal grant.\nAny Phase IIB Competing Renewal applications
that do not propose to develop products that require regulatory
approval, or that exceed the total cost budget cap, will be withdrawn
from consideration prior to peer review.\nFor more information on

NINDS may decline funding of a clinical trial application for
programmatic or administrative reasons. SBIR applicants are strongly
encouraged to contact Joanne Odenkirchen (contact information provided
below) within the NINDS Office of Clinical Research for advice about
potential clinical trial applications prior to submission in order to
determine the relevance of the proposed research to NINDS and its
potential for translating discoveries to clinical interventions for

Cooperative Program in Translational Research\nAlthough translational
research is supported through the general SBIR\/STTR program
announcement, the NINDS also has a Cooperative Program in Translational
research (PAR-08-235). The NINDS Cooperative Program encourages Phase II
 and Fast-Track applications that directly address the identification
and pre-clinical testing of new therapeutics for neurological disorders.
 The program will facilitate solicitation, development, and review of
therapy-directed projects to accelerate the translation of basic
research discoveries into therapeutic candidates for clinical testing.
This program is specifically directed at projects that include
therapeutic leads with demonstrated activity against the intended
disease target. The program supports pre-clinical optimization and
testing of these leads and projects must be sufficiently advanced that
an IND or IDE application to the FDA can be submitted by the end of the
project period. The program does not support early-stage therapeutic
discovery activities such as high throughput screening. The program also
 excludes clinical research, basic research, and studies of disease
mechanism. This is a milestone-driven cooperative agreement program
involving participation of NINDS staff in the development of the project
 plan and monitoring of research progress. For more information on the

manages the NIH Countermeasures Against Chemical Threats (CounterACT)
program. CounterACT supports research and development on new and
improved therapeutics or diagnostic technologies to prevent or mitigate
the toxic effects from exposure to chemical threats, defined as toxic
chemical agents that could be used in a terrorist attack against
civilians, or those that could be released at toxic levels by accident
or natural disaster. This includes the development of new (or support of
 existing) partnerships between small business and not-for-profit
laboratories engaged in this research. The scope of research supported
includes early screening for compounds with the desired biological
activity, advanced preclinical and efficacy testing, through clinical
research with promising candidate therapeutics. For more information on

(FMCSA)",
        "description": "\n    \n        The primary mission of Federal
Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) of Department of
Transportation (DOT) is to reduce crashes, injuries and\n
fatalities involving large truck and buses. One of the strategies
employed to accomplish this goal is to foster innovative research in new
 or\n        augmenting safety enhancing technologies and to facilitate
faster deployment of proven systems. In collaboration with our industry
partners and\n        stakeholders, we continuously identify new
opportunities of emphasis that can serve our agency goals and objectives
 towards improving highway safety.\n        The opportunity outlined in
this solicitation refers to a challenge that, if addressed robustly and
cost-effectively, has the high potential to further\n        improve the
 efficacies of existing safety technologies.\n    \n    \n
Background:\n    \n    \n        In North America, the powered heavy
trucks often haul a variety of towed units during their operation. As a
reference, some of the common combination\n        vehicle
configurations can be found on page 26 (Figure 7) of the TRB publication
 "Trucking 101" [1].\u00a0\n        \n        In most cases, the
combination vehicles are not "married couples", i.e., the tractor and
the trailer(s) do not stay coupled through the life span of\n        the
 vehicles. The common Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) operation involves a
 tractor to haul different trailers as often as in each trip.\n    \n
 \n        Furthermore, the typical lifecycle of a trailer is much
longer than that for a tractor. There are operational and economic
reasons leading to these\n        market dynamics, but the important
ramification of this fact is that tractors often have to haul a wide
variety of old and new trailers with\n        substantially differing
characteristics. And there is little-to-no information available to the
tractor as to what is being towed (that can be\n        automatically
detected without driver input).\n    \n    \n        This solicitation
calls for innovative solutions to automatically identify some trailer
attributes from within the tractor (powered unit). These\n
attributes of interest will be discussed in further details later on.\n
   \n    \n        Purpose:\n    \n    \n        On-board safety systems
 on newer tractors are capable of providing enhanced safety margins for
combination CMVs under a wide variety of operating\n        conditions.
Such systems include Electronic\/Roll Stability Control, Adaptive Cruise
 Control and Crash Imminent Emergency Brake Assist, among others.\n
   They operate with nominal assumptions on the trailer characteristics.
 The need for these assumptions limits developers' ability to further
optimize\n        their safety systems' performances. Hence, there is
substantial potential to improve efficacies of such on-board safety
systems if there were a\n        mechanism to automatically determine
certain trailer characteristics from within the tractor in a robust
manner without the reliance on the operator to\n        be in the loop.
Automatic detections need to be convertible into electrical signals that
 can be communicated via the vehicle database to these safety\n
systems.\n    \n    \n        Furthermore, the ability to know the
vehicle combination type and the associated attributes of the trailer(s)
 at the tractor has the potential to\n        simplify mobility
applications such as Truck Parking initiatives (where parking
reservation systems can be more optimally carried out if the\n
combination vehicle characteristics are known) and to improve
implementation efficacies of connected vehicle applications such as
Vehicle-to-Vehicle\n        (V2V) safety functions where one of the V's
in the interaction is a combination vehicle with unique
characteristics.\n    \n    \n        Objectives:\n    \n    \n
This solicitation calls for innovative solutions to identify some
trailer attributes from within the tractor. Some trailer attributes of
interest are\n        the following and the proposed solution shall
address at least a subset of the high priority attributes (as defined
within the context of this\n        solicitation) on this list:\n    \n
   \n        High priority attributes:\n    \n    \n        \n
  The number of trailer units being towed,\n        \n        \n
    \n                An\u00a0accurate\u00a0determination of whether the
 combination vehicle is a tractor-semi, tractor \u2013double trailer or
tractor-triple trailer (at\n                a minimum, differentiate
between semi and multi-trailer cases),\n            \n        \n
\n            The existence\/nonexistence of (functioning) trailer ABS
on (each of) the towed unit(s),\n        \n        \n            \n
           An\u00a0accurate\u00a0determination of whether
a\u00a0functioning ABS\u00a0system is existent on\u00a0each\u00a0of the
hauled trailer units.\n            \n        \n    \n    \n
Secondary attributes of interest are:\n    \n    \n        \n
 The\u00a0length\u00a0of the trailer unit(s) (or the aggregated trailer
train length),\n        \n        \n            The\u00a0number of
axles\u00a0and their potential locations (configurations of) on the

determining other trailer attributes for consideration as well. Such
propositions need to explain why those\n        factors would be
important to vehicle and traffic safety. Proposers shall research and be
 aware of existing mechanisms to determine certain\n
characteristics and identify the unique benefits of their propositions
while keeping current means in perspective. For instance, using mass
estimation\n        algorithms and hard coded bobtail weight
specifications of a tractor, it is possible to reliably determine if a
trailer is connected to the tractor or\n        not. That same mechanism
 also can help determine the total weight of the trailer but cannot tell
 what the weight difference is between the trailer and\n        the load
 or how many trailers may be connected at any given time.\n    \n    \n
       Requirements for the Research:\n    \n    \n        The vision
for this solicitation is that the concept system will be fully
decentralized and be resident on the tractor. It can be assumed that
such a\n        system will be installed on new tractors only (i.e. it
will not be retrofitted on older tractors in the field). Since one of
the primary objectives of\n        this study is to improve efficacies
of the listed commercially available technologies, the proposers can
assume the existence of them on the tractor.\n    \n    \n        The
summary of the constraints associated with the Phase I work are the
following.\n    \n    \n        \n            The proposed solution
shall be hosted solely on the powered unit (tractor), i.e., the proposed
 solution shall not depend on the existence or\n
non-existence of non-standard components on the Trailers and shall not
require installation of anything new (on the Trailers).\n        \n
   \n            \n                While the above requirement is
ultimately desired, practical solutions requiring very rudimentary
modifications to the trailer units may also\n                be
considered, however, they should be very easy to install and very cost
effective. Furthermore, if a modification to the trailer is proposed\n
              as part of the solution, a section should be dedicated in
the technical approach section describing why high volume costs
(component,\n                installation and maintenance costs) would
be considered cost-effective and feasible keeping the pool of existing
Trailers in the field in\n                perspective.\n            \n
      \n        \n            There should be no additional connections
required to the trailers except for the common connections such as the
7-pin electrical connector and the\n            pneumatic connections
between the powered and towed units (via the gladhands ),\n        \n
     \n            The solution shall work with all new and legacy
trailers without a priori knowledge on the trailer attributes,\n
\n        \n            The solution shall not rely on the operator's
action or inaction,\n        \n        \n            The solution shall
not rely on the existence of or communication to a road-side equipment
or require for new infrastructural changes,\n        \n        \n
     The determination accuracy shall be documented and be better than
2-sigma level (95.5%) in correctly identifying each subgroup within a
given\n            characteristics,\n        \n        \n            The
 solution could depend on a reasonable learning period where estimation
logic may need to take its course. However, the system shall provide a\n
            confidence metric and converge to a highly reliable
determination within a reasonable amount of time. An example "reasonable
 time" would be from\n            the vehicle power-up event to the
vehicle reaching 20mph speed for the first time. This is not a golden
rule but an example that can be used as\n            guidance. Proposals
 that depend on a "learning period" shall discuss the reasonableness of
the convergence requirements.\n        \n    \n    \n        Research
Plan:\n    \n    \n        The proposers should outline a sound
technical approach that can address at least a subset of the trailer
attributes classified as "high priority"\n        within the context of
this solicitation. Phase I work should result in a proof of concept for
the proposed trailer attribute determination system.\u00a0\n        \n
      During Phase II, the system will be developed to demonstrate the
capability at the desired accuracy levels on real vehicles and a risk
assessment plan\n        will be carried out to address the potential
failure modes and the corresponding ramifications for the intended uses
of this solution.\n    \n    \n        Targeted Technology Readiness
Level (TRL) for Phase I is "Basic Technology Research" (TRL 1 &amp;amp;
2) and "Research to Prove Feasibility" (TRL 2 &amp;amp;\n        3).\n
  \n    \n        Notes:\n    \n    \n        \n            Roadside
based solutions are NOT part of this solicitation. There is other
research being carried out where trailer attributes can be measured
via\n            external devices and wirelessly communicated to the
vehicle. Such proposals to this solicitation will not be considered.\n
      \n        \n            \n                Examples of such work
are TDS Model 110 [3] and TDS Model 230 [4], as well as another SBIR
11.1 FH3 (closed). [5]\n            \n        \n        \n
The accuracy desired for the determination of the number of connected
trailer units is 6-sigma level (99.9997%). However, projected accuracies
 of\n            2-sigma (95.5%) or better would be considered for Phase
 I evaluations [accuracy is implied for each subgroup
characterization].\n        \n        \n            Camera based
solutions are often not well suited for this kind of research. While
such technologies are not excluded from consideration, a proposer\n
       leveraging camera-based technologies shall address the common
shortcomings of such technology such as their impairment by inclement
weather,\n            surface reflections, lens contamination,
background interference, among others.\n        \n        \n
Since existing connectivity between the tractor and the trailer(s) take
place over the power line and the pneumatic line, the prospective
proposers\n            are encouraged to attempt to further leverage
these mechanisms in conjunction with recent advances in electronics,
computing, acoustics and\n            nano-technology among others. An
example technology that leverages power-line connectivity is power line
carrier (PLC) for trucks [2].\n        \n        \n            If the
proposed technology is susceptible to vibration, the proposal should
address how the technical approach will handle cab suspension.\n
\n        \n            The proposers are responsible to investigate and
 disclose all trademarks, licensing needs and intellectual property
rights that may be in place in\n            relation to their
proposals.\n        \n    \n\n",

 Modern passive microwave space-borne sensors and even planned sensors
have only a limited number of channels available, totaling anywhere
