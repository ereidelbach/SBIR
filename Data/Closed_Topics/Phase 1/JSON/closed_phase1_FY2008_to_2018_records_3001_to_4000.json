        "description": "Lead Center: GSFC\nParticipating Center(s):
JPL\nTerrestrial Balloons \nNASA\u2019s Scientific Balloons provide
practical and cost effective platforms for conducting discovery science,
 development and testing for future space instruments, as well as
training opportunities for future scientists and engineers. Balloons can
 reach altitudes above 36 kilometers, with suspended masses up to 3600
kilograms, and can stay afloat for several weeks. Currently, the Balloon
 Program is on the verge of introducing an advanced balloon system that
will enable 100 day missions at mid-latitudes and thus resemble the
performance of a small spacecraft at a fraction of the cost. In support
of this development, NASA is seeking innovative technologies in three
key areas:&amp;nbsp;\nPower Storage \nImproved and innovative devices to
 store electrical energy onboard balloon payloads are needed.&amp;nbsp;
Long duration balloon flights can experience 12 hours or more of
darkness, and excess electrical power generated during the day from
solar panels needs to be stored and used.&amp;nbsp; Improvements are
needed over the current state of the art in power density, energy
density, overall size, overall mass and\/or cost.&amp;nbsp; Typical
parameters for balloon are 28 VDC and 100 to 1000 watts power
consumption. Rechargeable batteries are presently used for balloon
payload applications.&amp;nbsp; Lithium Ion rechargeable batteries with
energy densities of 60 watt-hours per kilogram are the current state of
the art. Higher power storage energy densities, and power generation
capabilities of up to 2000 watts are needed for future
support.\nSatellite Communications \nImproved and innovative downlink
bitrates using satellite relay communications from balloon payloads are
needed.&amp;nbsp; Long duration balloon flights currently utilize
satellite communication systems to relay science and operations data
from the balloon to ground based control centers.&amp;nbsp; The current
maximum downlink bit rate is 150 kilobits per second operating
continuously during the balloon flight.&amp;nbsp; Future requirements
are for bit rates of 1 megabit per second or more.&amp;nbsp;
Improvements in bit rate performance, reduction in size and mass of
existing systems, or reductions in cost of high bit rate systems are
needed. TDRSS and Iridium satellite communications are currently used
for balloon payload applications.&amp;nbsp; A commercial S-band TDRSS
transceiver and mechanically steered 18 dBi gain antenna provide 150
kbps continuous downlink.&amp;nbsp; TDRSS K-band transceivers are
available but are currently cost prohibitive.&amp;nbsp; Open port
Iridium service is under development, but the operational cost is
prohibitive.&amp;nbsp;\nUV Protection Technologies \nInnovative,
economic, and applicable processes or materials to protect the balloon
flight train subsystems and the balloon components are needed. Long
duration balloon missions on the order of 100 days will expose the
balloon flight train subsystems such as the parachute, and the balloon
components such as the high strength tendons, to the harmful effects of
UV exposure. The impact may lead to shorter duration missions and\/or
severe damage to the science payloads. Innovative concepts are need for
the protection of these subsystems or components to eliminate or
minimize these adverse UV effects. The proposed innovative concepts
shall be economic and practical. It shall be easy to implement with no
major impact on balloon design, fabrication, packaging, or launch
operations.\nPlanetary Balloons \nInnovations in materials, structures,
and systems concepts have enabled the lifetime of Titan and Venus
buoyant vehicles to play an expanding role in NASA's future Solar System
 Exploration Program. Balloons are expected to carry scientific payloads
 at Titan and Venus that will perform in-situ investigations of their
atmospheres and near surface environments. Both Titan and Venus feature
extreme environments that significantly impact the design of balloons
for those two worlds and efficient use of energy is
critical.&amp;nbsp;\nProposals are sought in the following
areas:\nFloating Platforms for Venus (New)\nNASA is interested in
conducting long term monitoring of the Venus atmosphere and the
signatures of seismic and volcanic events from the planetary surface
using floating vehicles at altitudes of between 30 and 45 km for periods
 in excess of five years. Concepts that use ammonia or water as a source
 of buoyancy as well as conventional light gases hydrogen and helium
should be considered. A primary focus should be on the design of the
flotation device and the materials for achieving long duration
operation. The temperature at 45 km is roughly 110\u00b0 C; at 30 km it
is about 225\u00b0 C. It is expected that a Phase I effort will consist
of a system-level design and a proof-of-concept experiment on one or
more key components.\nAltitude and Positional Control for Titan Aerial
Vehicles (NEW)\nNASA is interested in Titan aerial vehicles that can
both change altitude and also execute controlled movements in latitude
and longitude in order to target surface locations of interest.
Innovative concepts are sought that can minimize the use of scarce power
 resources and can achieve controlled motions in latitude under all
anticipated atmosphere conditions and in longitude for parts of the
Titan year. The targeted capabilities for the system are as follows:
altitude range between the surface and 15 km, system mass of payload,
power and communications systems of 100 kg; average power usage for
horizontal and vertical mobility of less than 50 watts.&amp;nbsp; It is
expected that a Phase I effort will consist of a complete system-level
design and a proof-of-concept experiment on one or more key
components.",

 GRC, JPL, JSC, LaRC, MSFC\nFuture Spacecraft and instruments for NASA's
 Science Mission Directorate will require increasingly sophisticated
thermal control technology.&amp;nbsp; Innovative proposals for the
cross-cutting thermal control discipline are sought in the following
areas:\n\nComponents of advanced small spacecraft such as
CubeSat\/SmallSat will have very small masses (i.e., small thermal
capacitance), and their temperatures are highly sensitive to variations
in the component power output and spacecraft environmental temperature.
Advanced thermal devices capable of maintaining components within their
specified temperature ranges are needed. Some examples are:\n\nPhase
change systems with high thermal capacity and minimal structural
mass.\nHigh performance, low cost insulation systems for diverse
environments.\nHigh flux heat acquisition and transport devices; d)
thermal coatings with low absorptance, high emmittance, and good
electrical conductivity; and e) a miniature pumped fluid loop system
that is lightweight, provides radiator turndown, and consumes minimal
power (&amp;lt; 2W).\n\n\nCurrent capillary heat transfer devices
require tedious processes to insert the porous wick into the evaporator
and to seal the wick ends for liquid and vapor separation. Advanced
technology such as additive manufacturing is needed to simplify the
processes and ensure good sealing at both ends of the wick, especially
for miniature thermal systems for CubeSat\/SmallSat applications.
Additive manufacturing technology can also be used to produce integrated
 heat exchangers for pumped fluid loops in order to increase heat
transfer performance while significantly reducing mass, labor and
cost.\nScience missions are more dependent on optically sensitive
instruments and systems, and effects of thermal distortion on the
performance of the system are critical. Current
Structural-Thermal-Optical (STOP) analysis has several codes that do
some form of integrated analysis, but none that have the capability to
analyze any optical system and do a full end-to-end analysis. An
improvement of existing code is needed in order to yield software that
can integrate with all commonly used programs at NASA for mechanical,
structural, thermal and optical analysis. The software should be
user-friendly, and allow full STOP analysis for performance predictions
based on mechanical design, and structural\/thermal material
properties.\nMissions with high sink temperatures require temperature
lifting devices in order to dissipate the heat. Some advanced devices
having long life, high efficiency are sought for, including
absorption\/adsorption systems, advanced TECs, etc.&amp;nbsp; The use of
 heat lift devices can also reduce the radiator area, hence realizing
mass and volume savings.\n\n\nCurrent analysis for ablation analysis of
re-entry vehicles utilizes various computer codes for predicting the
following individual phenomena: aeroheating, ablation, thermal response
behind the bond line, thermal radiation, and structural response to
thermal and pressure environments. The interfaces between each code lead
 to potential errors, inaccuracy, and huge computer run time. What is
needed is a single code that evaluates the trajectory or input
conditions, predicts aeroheating over the surface, does an integrated
ablation-thermal analysis, and then uses that thermal and pressure
gradient to do a full structural analysis.&amp;nbsp; Even better would
be a link back to the aeroheating prediction code to revise the
aeroheating based on shape change from structural analysis and
ablation.\nNew techniques for measuring the internal pressure of arcjet
test samples are sought. &amp;nbsp;Modern ablation codes such as FEAR
and CHAR solve the Darcy flow equations to track both the internal
pyrolysis gas pressure and mass flow. However, there is currently no
data available to validate the internal pressure calculations due to a
lack of a reliable and accurate measurement system.&amp;nbsp; The
internal pressure calculation becomes even more important when analyzing
 flexible thermal protection system materials which are highly
porous.\n\nResearch should be conducted to demonstrate technical
feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II hardware
demonstration.&amp;nbsp; Phase II should deliver a demonstration unit
for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.",

        "description": "Lead Center: MSFC\nSteep dispersions in
engineered media of a wide variety have opened up a new direction of
research in optics. A positive dispersion can be used to slow the
propagation of optical pulses to extremely small velocities. Similarly, a
 negative dispersion can lead to conditions where pulses propagate
superluminally. These effects have now moved beyond the stage of
intellectual curiosity, and have ushered in studies of a set of exciting
 applications of interest to NASA, ranging from ultraprecise
superluminal gyroscopes to spectral interferometers having enhanced
resolving power.\nThis research subtopic seeks slow-light and\/or
fast-light enhanced sensors for space applications of interest to NASA
including:\nSuperluminal gyroscopes and accelerometers (both passive and
 active) \n\nEnhanced strain and displacement sensors for
non-destructive evaluation and integrated vehicle health management
applications.\nSlow-light-enhanced spectrally-resolved interferometers
for astrophysical and Earth science observations, as well as for
exploration goals.\nOther applications of slow and fast light related to
 NASA\u2019s mission areas.&amp;nbsp;\n\nSuperluminal gyroscopes \nIn
conventional ring laser gyroscopes, sensitivity increases with cavity
size. Fast light, however, can be used to increase gyro sensitivity
without having to increase size, for spacecraft navigation systems which
 are constrained by weight and volume. The increased sensitivity also
opens up new science possibilities such as detection of subsurface
geological features, tests of Lorentz invariance, improving the
bandwidth sensitivity product for gravity wave detection, and tests of
general relativity. This research subtopic seeks:\n\nPrototype fast
light gyroscopes, active or passive, that unambiguously demonstrate a
scale factor enhancement of at least 10 with the potential for 1000. The
 minimum or quantum-noise limited angular random walk (ARW) should also
decrease.\nDesigns for fast light gyros that do not require frequency
locking, are not limited to operation at specific frequencies such as
atomic or material resonances, and permit operation at any
wavelength.\nFast light gyroscope designs that are rugged, compact,
monolithic, rad-hard, and tolerant to variations in temperature and
varying G-conditions.\n\nSlow-light enhanced spectral interferometers
\nSlow light has the potential to increase the resolving power of
spectral interferometers such as Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS)
for astrophysical applications without increasing their size. Mariner,
Voyager, and Cassini all used FTS instruments for applications such as
mapping atmospheres and examining ring compositions. The niche for FTS
is usually thought to be for large wavelength (IR and beyond),
wide-field, moderate spectral resolution instruments. Slow light,
however, could help boost FTS spectral resolution making FTS instruments
 more competitive with grating-based instruments, and opening up
application areas not previously thought to be accessible to FTS
instruments, such as exoplanet detection. A slow-light FTS could also be
 hyper-spectral, providing imaging capability. FTS instruments have been
 employed for remote sensing on NASA Earth Science missions, such as the
 Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS), Cross-track Infrared
Sounder (CrIS), and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES)
experiments, and have long been considered for geostationary imaging of
atmospheric greenhouse gases. This research subtopic seeks research and
development of slow-light-enhanced spectral interferometers that are not
 restricted by material resonances and can operate at any wavelength. An
 inherent advantage of FTS systems are their wide bandwidth. It will
therefore of importance to develop slow light FTS systems that can
maintain a large operating bandwidth.",

landers, and robotic and sample return missions, require robust command
and control capabilities. Advances in technologies relevant to command
and data handling and instrument electronics are sought to support
NASA's goals and several missions and projects under development.\nThe
2016 subtopic goals are to develop platforms for the implementation of
miniaturized highly integrated avionics and instrument electronics
that:\n\nAre consistent with the performance requirements for NASA
science missions.\nMinimize required mass\/volume\/power as well as
development cost\/schedule resources.\nCan operate reliably in the

approach.\nPresent how it could be infused into a NASA

an understanding of the intended operating environment, including
temperature and radiation. It should be noted that environmental
requirements can vary significantly from mission to mission. For
example, some low earth orbit missions have a total ionizing dose (TID)
radiation requirement of less than 10 krad(Si), while some planetary

descriptions of radiation effects in electronics, the proposer may visit
 (http:\/\/radhome.gsfc.nasa.gov\/radhome\/overview.htm).\nIf a Phase II
 proposal is awarded, the combined Phase I and Phase II developments
should produce a prototype that can be characterized by NASA.\nThe
technology priorities sought are listed below:\n\nSpaceflight Multicore
Middleware - Current and emerging spaceflight processors are leveraging
multi-core architectures to satisfy the ever increasing onboard
processing demands.&amp;nbsp; These architectures can provide increased
processing bandwidth, power efficiency, and fault tolerance for onboard
processing applications.&amp;nbsp; However, these advantages come at the
 cost of increased hardware and software complexity.&amp;nbsp; As
software development is a major cost driver for missions, this increased
 complexity has the potential to significantly increase cost for future
NASA missions.&amp;nbsp; To address this risk, this subtopic solicits
Spaceflight Multicore Middleware technology providing machine management
 for multicore processing devices.&amp;nbsp; This middleware software
layer shall primarily reside between the application layer and the
operating system, with extensions into and below the OS as necessary, to
 provide intelligent resource, fault, and power management.&amp;nbsp; By
 providing these functions, application software can be largely agnostic
 to underlying hardware, thereby reducing cost and complexity.&amp;nbsp;
 It is desired that the middleware software support multiple processor
architectures. Examples include, but not limited to, ARM, Freescale,
Tilera, and LEON, and those that support a number of cores ranging from
2-32.&amp;nbsp;\nAdvanced Spaceflight Memory - As spaceflight processor
technology advances to provide increased bandwidth, power efficiency,
and flexibility, advanced spaceflight memory devices are needed to fully
 leverage these improvements.&amp;nbsp; This subtopic solicits
technologies enabling power efficient, high performance volatile
spaceflight memory incorporating high speed, fault tolerant, serial
interfaces, internal EDAC, power and fault&amp;nbsp;
management,&amp;nbsp; and 2.5\/3D manufacturing processes enabling
implementation of miniaturized, highly-reliable fault tolerant
systems.&amp;nbsp;\nPoint-of-Load Power Converters - Emerging
spaceflight processors require multiple supply voltages, and multiple
switched services for many of these voltages.&amp;nbsp; Using currently
available point-of-load power converters, an unacceptably large portion
of future spaceflight computer boards will need to be dedicated for
these devices.&amp;nbsp; To address this concern, this subtopic solicits
 technologies enabling miniaturized spaceflight point-of-load power
conversion and switching.&amp;nbsp;\nRadiation Shielding - Innovative
additive manufacturing and\/or deposition technologies starting at TRL 3
 are sought to create integral one-piece surface claddings of graded
atomic number (Z) materials for use as radiation shielding for
electronics. Shielding thicknesses must be able to achieve up to 3
g\/cm2 for initial shielding applications. At the end of Phase I,
delivery of layered slabs and\/or half sphere samples is expected with
areal densities from 1 -3 g\/cm2; samples must be able to show a strong
interface property to avoid delamination and consistent density and
thickness (areal density) uniformity.\n\nThis subtopic also solicits
technologies enabling the use of COTS micropower\/ultra-low power
computing devices in highly reliable spacecraft avionics systems.",

        "description": "Lead Center: JPL\nA need to develop technologies
 to implement Contamination Control and Planetary Protection
requirements has emerged in recent years with increased interest in
investigating bodies with the potential for life detection such as
Europa, Enceladus, Mars, etc. and the potential for sample return from
such bodies. Planetary Protection is concerned with both forward and
backward contamination. Forward contamination is the transfer of viable
organisms from Earth to another body. Backward contamination is the
transfer of material posing a biological threat back to Earth's
biosphere. NASA is seeking innovative technologies or applications of
technologies to facilitate meeting portions of forward and backward
contamination Planetary Protection requirements as well as analytical
technologies that can ensure hardware and instrumentation can meet
organic contamination requirements in an effort to preserve sample
science integrity.&amp;nbsp;\nFor contamination control efforts,
analytical technologies and techniques for quantifying submicron
particle and organic contamination for validating surface cleaning
methods are needed. In particular, capabilities for measuring Total
Organic Carbon (TOC) at &amp;lt;&amp;lt;40 ppb or &amp;lt;&amp;lt;20
ng\/cm2 on a surface and detection of particles &amp;lt;0.2 microns in
size are being sought. In addition, techniques for detection of one or
more of the following molecules and detection level are being
needed:&amp;nbsp;\n\nDNA (1 fmole).\nDipicolinic acid (1
pg).\nN-acetylglucosamine (1 pg).\nGlycine and alanine (1 pg).\nPalmitic
 acid (1 pg).\nSqalene (1 pg).\nPristane (1pg).\nChlorobenzene
(&amp;lt;1 pg).\nDichloromethane (&amp;lt;1 pg).\nNaphthalene (1
pg).&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor many missions, Planetary Protection requirements
are often implemented in part by processing hardware or potentially
entire spacecraft with one or more sterilization processes. These
processes are often incompatible with particular materials or components
 on the spacecraft and extensive effort is made to try to mitigate these
 issues. Innovative new or improved sterilization\/re-sterilization
processes are being sought for application to spacecraft hardware to
increase effectiveness of reducing bio-load on spacecraft or increase
process compatibility with hardware (e.g., toxicity to hardware,
temperature, duration, etc.). Accepted processes currently include heat
processing, gamma\/electron beam irradiation, cold plasma, and vapor
hydrogen peroxide. Options to improve materials and parts (e.g.,
sensors, seals, in particular, batteries, valves, and optical coatings)
to be compatible with currently accepted processes, in particular heat
tolerance, are needed. NASA is seeking novel technologies for preventing
 recontamination of sterilized components or spacecraft as a whole
(e.g., biobarriers). In addition, active in-situ
recontamination\/decontamination approaches (e.g., in-situ heating of
sample containers to drive off volatiles prior to sample collection) and
 in-situ sterilization approaches (e.g., UV or plasma) for surfaces are
desired.&amp;nbsp;\nMissions planning sample return from bodies such as
Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are faced with developing technologies for
sample return functions to assure containment of material from these
bodies. Thus far, concepts have been developed specifically for Mars
sample return but no end-to-end concepts have been developed that do not
 have technical challenges remaining in one or more areas. Options for
sample canisters with seal(s) (e.g., brazing, explosive welding, soft)
with sealing performed either on surface or in orbit and capability to
verify seal(s), potentially by leak detection are needed. In addition,
capability is needed for opening seals while maintaining sample
integrity upon Earth return. These technologies need to be compatible
with processes the materials may encounter over the lifecycle of the
mission (e.g., high temperature heating). Containment assurance also
requires technologies to break-the-chain of contact with the sampled
body. Any native contamination on the returned sample container and\/or
Earth return vehicle must be either be fully contained, sterilized, or
removed prior to return to Earth, therefore, technologies or concepts to
 mitigate this contamination are desired. Lightweight shielding
technologies are also needed for meteoroid protection for the Earth
entry vehicle and sample canister with capability to detect damage or
breach to meet a 10-6 probability of loss of containment. ",

GSFC\nNASA scientists and engineers are increasingly turning to
large-scale numerical simulation on supercomputers to advance
understanding of complex Earth and astrophysical systems, and to conduct
 high-fidelity aerospace engineering analyses. The goal of this subtopic
 is to increase the mission impact of NASA's investments in
supercomputing systems and associated operations and services. Specific
objectives are to: &amp;nbsp;\n\nDecrease the barriers to entry for
prospective supercomputing users.\nMinimize the supercomputer user's
total time-to-solution (e.g., time to discover, understand, predict, or
design).\nIncrease the achievable scale and complexity of computational
analysis, data ingest, and data communications.\nReduce the cost of
providing a given level of supercomputing performance on NASA
applications.\nEnhance the efficiency and effectiveness of NASA's
supercomputing operations and services. &amp;nbsp;\n\nExpected outcomes
are to improve the productivity of NASA's supercomputing users, broaden
NASA's supercomputing user base, accelerate advancement of NASA science
and engineering, and benefit the supercomputing community through
dissemination of operational best practices. &amp;nbsp;\nThe approach of
 this subtopic is to seek novel software and hardware technologies that
provide notable benefits to NASA's supercomputing users and facilities,
and to infuse these technologies into NASA supercomputing operations.
Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be
considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, NASA's high-end
computing (HEC) projects - the High End Computing Capability project at
Ames and the Scientific Computing project at Goddard. To assure maximum
relevance to NASA, funded SBIR contracts under this subtopic should
engage in direct interactions with one or both HEC projects, and with
key HEC users where appropriate. Research should be conducted to
demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and
show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration.
&amp;nbsp;\nOfferors should demonstrate awareness of the
state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage
existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where appropriate.
 Open source software and open standards are strongly preferred. Note
that the NASA supercomputing environment is characterized by:
&amp;nbsp;\n\nHEC systems operating behind a firewall to meet strict IT
security requirements.\nCommunication-intensive applications.\nMassive
computations requiring high concurrency.\nComplex computational
workflows and immense datasets.\nThe need to support hundreds of complex
 application codes - many of which are frequently updated by the
user\/developer. &amp;nbsp;\n\nAs a result, solutions that involve the
following must clearly explain how they would work in the NASA
environment: &amp;nbsp;\n\nTechnologies involving elements operating
outside of the NASA supercomputing firewall.\nEmbarrassingly parallel
computations.\nTechnologies that require significant application
re-engineering. &amp;nbsp;\n\nProjects need not benefit all NASA HEC
users or application codes, but demonstrating applicability to an
important NASA discipline, or even a key NASA application code, could
provide significant value. &amp;nbsp;\nSpecific technology areas of
interest:&amp;nbsp;\n\nEfficient Computing - In spite of the rapidly
increasing capability and efficiency of supercomputers, NASA's HEC
facilities cannot purchase, power, and cool sufficient HEC resources to
satisfy all user demands. This subtopic element seeks dramatically more
efficient and effective supercomputing approaches in terms of their
ability to supply increased HEC capability or capacity per dollar
and\/or per Watt for real NASA applications. Examples
include:&amp;nbsp;novel computational accelerators and architectures;
cloud supercomputing with high performance interconnects (e.g.,
InfiniBand); enhanced visualization technologies; improved algorithms
for key codes; power-aware "Green" computing technologies and
techniques; and approaches to effectively manage and utilize many-core
processors including algorithmic changes, compiler techniques and
runtime systems.\n\u200bUser Productivity Environments - The user
interface to a supercomputer is typically a command line in a text
window. This subtopic element seeks more intuitive, intelligent,
user-customizable, and integrated interfaces to supercomputing
resources, enabling users to more completely leverage the power of HEC
to increase their productivity. Such an interface could enhance many
essential supercomputing tasks: accessing and managing resources,
training, getting services, developing and porting codes (e.g.,
debugging and performance analysis), running computations, managing
files and data, analyzing and visualizing results, transmitting data,
collaborating, etc.\nUltra-Scale Computing - Over the next decade, the
HEC community faces great challenges in enabling its users to
effectively exploit next-generation supercomputers featuring massive
concurrency to the tune of millions of cores. To overcome these
challenges, this subtopic element seeks ultra-scale computing
technologies that enable resiliency\/fault-tolerance in extreme-scale
(unreliable) systems both at job startup and during execution. Also of
interest are system and software co-design methodologies, to achieve
performance and efficiency synergies. Finally, tools are sought that
facilitate verification and validation of ultra-scale applications and
systems. \n",

for a variety of ecological applications such as managing coastal
environments, natural resources or responding to natural disasters.
&amp;nbsp;\nCurrently, creating decision support tools (DST) that
effectively utilize remote sensing data requires significant efforts by
experts in multiple domains. This creates a barrier to the widespread
use of Earth observations by state and local governments, businesses,
and the public. This subtopic aims to democratize the creation of Earth
science driven decision support tools and to unleash a creative
explosion of DST development that significantly increases the return on
investment for Earth science missions.&amp;nbsp;\nSpecifically, this
subtopic develops core capabilities that can be integrated to build
multiple remote sensing driven DSTs customized to the requirements of
different users in varied fields. Proven development and
commercialization strategies will be used to meet these objectives.
Similar to Eclipse, this subtopic will create an open-source DST
development framework that enables components from multiple providers to
 be seamlessly integrated. This subtopic will also create software
components that plug into the framework and open source tools that help
users create new components. The components will provide functionality
ranging from basic operations, such as retrieval of data meeting
user-specified criteria from online repositories and visualization, to
sophisticated data processing and analysis algorithms, such as
atmospheric correction, data fusion, computational model interfaces, and
 machine learning based quality control. &amp;nbsp;\nTo expedite DST
development and deployment by knowledgeable users, this subtopic seeks
an open source graphical workflow tool, similar to Labview or Simulink,
which enables well informed users to quickly create a functional DST
from a catalog of software components. Ultimately, a more sophisticated
graphical workflow development tool, similar to MIT's Scratch would
enforce functionally, but not necessarily logically, "correct by
construction" rules that would enable a broad population of people to
successfully create DSTs. Open source and commercial components, as well
 as services, will be available through an online "store" similar to
iTunes or Google Play.&amp;nbsp;\nThe framework, components and
resulting DSTs should be able to run in a commercial cloud such as
Amazon EC2 or Google Compute Engine. Cloud enabled components and DSTs,
those that can intelligently take advantage of flexible computing
resources for processing, analysis, visualization, optimization, etc.
are highly desired. &amp;nbsp;\nIdeally, users should be able to create,
 configure deploy DSTs, and view outputs such as status, reports,
alerts, plots, maps, etc. via desktop computers (Windows 7 and OS X) as
well as tablet and smart phones running recent versions of Android (4.0
and later) and iOS (5.0 and later). An HTML5 web application in a
standards compliant browser, such as Chrome, can provide the required
level of interoperability and capability. Due to serious security
issues, Java and Flash based approaches will not be

Fault Management (FM) is one of the key components of system autonomy.
FM consists of the operational mitigations of spacecraft failures. It is
 implemented with spacecraft hardware, on-board autonomous software that
 controls hardware, software, information redundancy, and ground-based
software and operations procedures. &amp;nbsp;\nMany recent Science
Mission Directorate (SMD) missions have encountered major cost overruns
and schedule slips during test and verification of FM functions. These
overruns are due to a lack of understanding of FM functions early in the

attributes of transparency, verifiability, fault isolation capability,
or fault coverage. The NASA FM Handbook is under development to improve
the FM design, development, verification and validation and operations

FM.&amp;nbsp;\nSpecific objectives are to: &amp;nbsp;\n\nImprove the

and implementations.\nDecrease the labor and time required to develop

FM system and the contribution of each mechanism to protecting mission
functions and assets is critical to assessing the completeness and
appropriateness of the FM design to the mission attributes (mission
type, risk posture, operations concept, etc.). Fault trees and state
transition diagrams are examples of visualization tools that could
contribute to visualization of the full FM design.\nFM Verification and
Validation Tools - As complexity of spacecraft and systems increases,
the extensiveness of testing required to verify and validate FM
implementations can be resource intensive. Automated test case
development, false positive\/false negative test tools, model
verification and validation tools, and test coverage risk assessments
are examples of contributing technologies.\nFM Design Architectures - FM
 capabilities may be implemented through numerous system, hardware, and
software architecture solutions. The FM architecture trade space
includes options such as embedded in the flight control software or
independent onboard software; on board versus ground-based capabilities;
 centralized or distributed FM functions; sensor suite implications;
integration of multiple FM techniques; innovative software FM
architectures implemented on flight processors or on Field Programmable
Gate Arrays (FPGAs); and execution in real-time or off-line analysis
post-operations. Alternative architecture choices such as model-based
approaches could help control FM system complexity and cost and could
offer solutions to transparency, verifiability, and completeness
challenges.\nMulti-discipline FM Interoperation - FM designers, Systems
Engineering, Safety and Mission Assurance, and Operations perform
analyses and assessments of reliabilities, failure modes and effects,
sensor coverage, failure probabilities, anomaly detection and response,
contingency operations, etc. The relationships between multi-discipline
data and analyses are inconsistent and misinterpreted. Resources are
expended either in effort to resolve disconnects in data and analyses or
 worse, reduced mission success due to failure modes that were
overlooked. Solutions that address data integrity, identification of
metrics, and standardization of data products, techniques and analyses
will reduce cost and failures. \n",

        "description": "Lead Center: GSFC\nParticipating Center(s): GRC,
 LaRC\nNASA is seeking performance improvements to Power Management and
Distribution (PMAD) systems through increases to the operating voltages
and temperatures of these electrical components.&amp;nbsp;Although many
parts exist in the commercial market place that would represent
significant improvements over the state of the art space qualified
components, these parts have failed to pass critical tests related to
space qualification, most importantly in terms of their radiation
tolerance. It is believed that the development and integration of high
voltage\/high temperature components that can be space qualified will
lead to increases in system level performance as they will tend to
increase efficiency and decrease mass at the system architecture level.
Such performance improvements are necessary if NASA is to realize
several operational concepts such as very high power Solar Electric
Propulsion (SEP) that undergird their future mission
architectures.&amp;nbsp;For example, SEP is a key technology supporting
NASA\u2019s deep space asteroid retrieval mission.&amp;nbsp;This SEP
mission requires total power on the order of 50 kW with a thruster power
 processing unit that steps up voltages to 700 V or more. These
parameters are not truly negotiable and in turn dictate certain design
choices for current and voltage regulation across the system.&amp;nbsp;
Given the space qualified electronic parts available today, system
engineers are frequently required to make sub-optimal design
choices.&amp;nbsp; In a simplistic but specific realization, higher
voltage parts allow power generation at higher voltages on the arrays
themselves, this higher voltage allows for the same power to be
transferred at lower current thereby reducing cable mass at the system
level.&amp;nbsp; At a more general level within the PMAD architecture,
the use of presently available parts forces design choices that end in
lower operating efficiency and increased heat generation within the
electronic system, which in turn drive overall system
mass.&amp;nbsp;\nThe premise of this solicitation is that there have
been recent improvements to semi-conductor devices at the material
level, e.g., SiC and GaN, which have enabled higher efficiency, voltage
and temperature regimes for parts and systems working
terrestrially.&amp;nbsp;However the first generation devices have proven
 unsatisfactory for use in space applications due to radiation-induced
early failures after exposure to heavy-ion fluences of concern to most
space missions.&amp;nbsp;Further research and development effort must be
 accomplished to fully understand the failure mechanisms within devices
made of these advanced materials and iterative design cycles must then
be conducted to develop components that have the performance
characteristics required for future NASA
missions.&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;The types of components coming under this
 topic include:&amp;nbsp;\n\nSemiconductor switches, e.g., the design of
 Wide Band Gap semiconductors such as switches and diodes using GaN or
SiC, with minimum voltage and current ratings of 1200 V and 12
A.\nSwitch driver diodes.\nHigh temperature capacitors.\nInterconnection
 wires for switchgears.\nAssociated control
electronics.&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis solicitation topic seeks proposals that
address each of the following points:&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnalysis and research
 into the failure modes related to heavy-ion radiation exposure, as well
 as high temperature operation of GaN and SiC devices.\nDesign and
development of \u201cnext-generation\u201d components.&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt
is important to note that technologies of interest to NASA under this
topic must not simply provide an incremental improvement as the solution
 but must have the potential to significantly improve upon device
operating points, thermal range, heavy-ion single-event effect
tolerance, and the mass and volume characteristics.&amp;nbsp; Proposals
submitted in response to this topic must state the initial component
state of the art and justify the expected final performance
metrics.&amp;nbsp;\nTarget performance levels
include:&amp;nbsp;\n\nRadiation hardness:&amp;nbsp;\n\n300 krad(Si)
total ionizing dose tolerance, and\nFor vertical-field power
devices:&amp;nbsp; No heavy-ion induced permanent destructive effects
upon irradiation with ions having a silicon-equivalent surface-incident
linear energy transfer (LET) of 40 MeV-cm2\/mg and sufficient energy to
fully penetrate the epitaxial layer(s) prior to the ions reaching their
maximum LET (Bragg peak)\nFor all other devices:&amp;nbsp; No heavy-ion
induced permanent destructive effects upon irradiation with ions having a
 silicon-equivalent surface-incident linear energy transfer (LET) of 75
MeV-cm2\/mg and sufficient energy to fully penetrate the active volume
prior to the ions reaching their maximum LET (Bragg peak).\n\n\nThermal

Exploration",
        "description": "Lead Center: JSC\nParticipating Center(s): GRC,
GSFC, JPL, MSFC\nNASA is seeking unique solutions for mid-temperature
thermal control technologies that will facilitate a low mass highly
reliable thermal control system for an exploration vehicle. Future human
 spacecraft will require more sophisticated thermal control systems that
 can operate in severe environments ranging from full sun to deep space
and can dissipate a wide range of heat loads. Planetary systems (both
human and robotic) need to minimize mass and maximize performance to
enable more science payloads, and face complications from dust and
regolith in many locations, and from the Mars atmosphere.&amp;nbsp;The
systems must perform their function while using fewer of the limited
spacecraft mass, volume and power resources while increasing the
reliability of these components. Furthermore, as human missions require
longer extravehicular activities, the need for a closed loop, mass
efficient thermal control system is needed for the EVA Suit. NASA's
Technology Roadmaps 6 and 14 cover many of the defined key performance
parameters sought through this SBIR. The following sub-topics seek to
cover the gaps outlined through this solicitation.&amp;nbsp;\nVariable
Heat Rejection Technologies&amp;nbsp;\nAs NASA moves beyond low earth
orbit, exploration vehicles that must accommodate various mission
scenarios find a need for variable heat rejection. A vehicle may need to
 operate in severe environments ranging from full sun to deep space
while managing a wide range waste energy rejection including active and
dormant phases. Heat rejection systems and\/or radiators that can
operate at low fractions of their design heat load in the cold
environments that are required for deep space missions. Room temperature
 thermal control systems are sought that are sized for full sun yet are
able to maintain set point control and operate stably at 25% of their
design heat load in a deep space (0 K) environment. This variation in
heat rejection is often described as a turn-down ratio. NASA Technology
Roadmap Area 14 outlines a turn down goal of 6 to 1 by a thermal control
 system operating at the scale of kilowatts of waste energy removal.
Solutions for variable heat rejection may include the use of novel
thermal control fluids, advanced radiator technologies, and\/or variable
 conductance.&amp;nbsp;\nAdvanced-Closed Loop EVA Thermal
Control&amp;nbsp;\nNASA has evolved space suit technology beyond the
Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) state of the art for exploration
missions. However, the latest iteration of the portable life support
system includes the use of a Suit Water Membrane Evaporator to
facilitate the rejection of waste energy produced by the suit, which
still vents water vapor like the EMU sublimators. Longer duration extra
vehicular activities and systems that do not impact the environment of
Mars are needed, including a closed loop, non-venting EVA thermal
control system capable of working in the Martian atmosphere. The
solicitation seeks novel approaches to close the thermal control system
of the Suit so that minimal to no consumables are used for rejection of
waste energy. Approaches may include, but are not limited to, novel
radiative approaches, desiccant systems to reclaim evaporants, etc.
Examples of such technologies and goals are outlined in NASA's
Technology Roadmap Area 06.&amp;nbsp;\nHighly Efficient, Low Pour Point
Thermal Control Fluids&amp;nbsp;\nMost if not all space vehicles have
the need for a thermal control fluid that does not freeze at relatively
low temperatures. These fluids with low pour points come with decreased
thermal performance, causing an increase in system mass to the thermal
control system. This scenario was apparent with JPL\u2019s Mars Science
Laboratory as well as the Orion Vehicle. Vehicles subjected to the
environments of deep space through transit scenarios to the Moon and
Mars especially need a highly efficient thermal control fluid with low
pour point. Ideally, this new thermal control fluid would have a pour
point near -110\u00b0C with thermal physical properties near water.
Furthermore, for use in human systems, this thermal control fluid would
have low toxicity, flammability, and vapor pressures for use in a
habitable volume.&amp;nbsp;\nAdvanced Heat
Exchangers&amp;nbsp;\nAir\/liquid, liquid\/liquid, coldplates, and phase
 change material heat exchangers are at the core of any thermal control
system for a vehicle. Advances in manufacturing may yield a considerable
 mass savings over the current state of the art heat exchangers.
Furthermore, lightweight non-venting phase change heat exchangers are
sought to ameliorate the environmental transients that would be seen in
planetary (Martian or Lunar) orbit. Heat exchangers that have minimal
structural mass and good thermal performance are sought. Furthermore,
the use of phase change materials that have a transition temperature
between 8\u00b0-12\u00b0C with heat of fusions above 200 kJ\/kg are
needed. The goal is a ratio exceeding 2\/3 phase change material mass
and 1\/3 structural mass. Condensing heat exchangers (air\/liquid heat
exchangers) are deemed to be a critical component of a closed loop
environmental control life support system. The need for highly reliable
condensing heat exchangers that do not contaminate due to microbial
growth and do not impact the water processing system of an ECLSS system
due to coatings on the HX is of high need for future human systems.
Finally, advances in the aforementioned heat exchangers are expected to
utilize new materials and manufacturing techniques over conventional
brazing processes used today. NASA's Technology Roadmap Area 14 details
various points of interest for these heat exchangers. ",

activities across the solar system.&amp;nbsp;With time delays and

the daunting task of operating and maintaining numerous systems that
might unexpectedly break or may even be required to perform life-saving
surgery without support from the earth based operators.&amp;nbsp;The
augmented reality (AR) technology holds the promise to reduce crew
reliance of ground and paper procedure support in a deep-space human
spaceflight missions. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;\nWithin the ISS Program,
maintenance requires well trained crew members and is labor intensive,
expensive and inefficient. NASA use paper and electronic procedures to
direct crew through complex maintenance procedures for all on-board
systems. Developing and executing procedures are still time consuming
and tedious tasks, and substantial training is needed to understand the
technical details for troubleshooting defective components, and the
performance of critical maintenance and repairs. Augmented Reality based

JSC, MSFC, SSC\nWireless sensor networks can effectively support an
array of sensors able to measure structural properties, the heat profile
 for thermal protection, impact detection for orbital debris and other
functions requiring distributed sensors. Moreover, embeddable passive
wireless sensors can greatly increase the capabilities of the sensing
and telemetry portion of a spacecraft. This would be relevant to any of
the ascent and landing systems needed for planetary exploration as part
of the spacecraft or mission support systems. Of particular interest is
the capability of adding sensors at a low cost - enabling better
Integrated Health Management and Spacecraft Autonomy functions, which
depend upon better sensing of spacecraft state and environment. If
developed under STMD, the resulting technology has high potential for
infusion into SMD and HEOMD Programs leading to more effective ascent
vehicles, better spacecraft management, new entry, descent and landing
systems and future planetary exploration systems.&amp;nbsp;\nWhile
wireless sensors have been slowly improved, tested and deployed on
earth, their extension to aerospace has not occurred. The technology
itself does not limit such extension, but rather traditional methods
using wired interconnects have proven adequate for most vehicles and
missions. However, there are major advantages conferred by wireless
technology for aerospace avionics that make adoption
favorable.&amp;nbsp;\nWireless technology&amp;nbsp;\n\nReduces the mass
and volume of spacecraft by eliminating large heavy cable runs. This is
particularly useful for small satellites, where internal volume is often
 highly constrained particularly for subsystem cables and connectors.
This would enable smaller and lighter spacecraft.\nCan transfer data
across pressure interfaces, into remote locations where it is difficult
to run cables and onto movable structures where cables are at risk of
failure.\nProvides less intrusive measurement and health monitoring
capability by enabling sensors within fuel tanks and pipes and across
pressure interfaces without breaching the structure.\nSupports late
additions or mission enhancements by significantly limiting changes to
vehicle structure and data paths.\nFunctions despite structural failures
 that can break physical wires such as those caused
by&amp;nbsp;micrometeorite impacts or connector contamination, thereby
creating heterogeneous redundancy for critical systems that improve
reliability and safety.\nSupports dynamic reconfiguration of networks
and components, enabling robust response to faults or changes in
operating mode.&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn time, wireless interconnects and
interaction methods could largely supplant (or perhaps more importantly,
 complement) wired methods. Consider the adoption of mobile computing
devices, which rely on purely wireless interfaces for communication,
printing and even peripheral connection. Such advantages can apply to
spacecraft, distributed sensor networks and even distributed instruments
 and planetary surface exploration systems.\nSpecifically, this subtopic
 solicits the following technologies: &amp;nbsp;\n\nLow power, low mass,
 and small volume components, where sensor\/actuator modules are less
than 20 grams in mass and less than 1 cc in volume. Of particular
interest are highly scalable systems for measurement and data
acquisition where total subsystem mass would be under 1 Kg and would
operate under 3 W of power.\nComponents capable of surviving and
operating in aerospace environments requiring tolerance to extreme
temperatures, shock and vibration, and radiation effects that exist for
satellites, launch vehicles, planetary and space habitats, deep space
exploration systems and landing\/re-entry systems.\nTechniques that
decrease reliance upon batteries or eliminate the need for charging and
battery replacement, including novel approaches for electromagnetic
energy harvesting, generating and storage methods; including capacitive,
 hybrid and acoustic power harvesting technologies.\nWireless
technology, protocols, architectures and software systems that support
redundant networks that can dynamically reconfigure to reestablish
connectivity and function after temporary interruptions or component
failures, including internal fault detection
capability.&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe major NASA and commercialization thrust for
 wireless technology would be its maturation for use in aviation and

practice.DefinitionsPriority Area 2 is restricted to R\/R&amp;amp;D for
products designed to support improved outcomes for infants, toddlers, or
 students with disabilities or at risk for disabilities. For the purpose
 of The Department\u2019s R\/R&amp;amp;D programs, a student with a
disability is defined in Public Law 108-446, the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA), as a child \u2015
 "(i) with mental retardation, hearing impairments (including deafness),
 speech or language impairments, visual impairments (including
blindness), serious emotional disturbance (referred to in this title as
'emotional disturbance'), orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic
brain injury, other health impairments, or specific learning
disabilities; and (ii) who, by reason thereof, needs special education
and related services" (Part A, Sec. 602).An infant or toddler with a
disability is defined in IDEA as, \u2015 "an individual under 3 years of
 age who needs early intervention services because the individual (i) is
 experiencing developmental delays, as measured by appropriate
diagnostic instruments and procedures in 1 or more of the areas of
cognitive development, physical development, communication development,
social or emotional development, and adaptive development; or (ii) has a
 diagnosed physical or mental condition that has a high probability of
resulting in developmental delay" (Part C, Sec. 632).Product Usage
Products must be for use in schools, alternative school settings, early
intervention or early childhood special education settings, or
supplemental education services as defined in Section 1116(e) of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No
Child Left Behind Act of 2001.Products to be used with infants and
toddlers receiving early intervention services may be implemented in
other natural settings (e.g., home-based, child care settings,
family-focused interventions). Products for prekindergarten through
Grade 12 students must be implemented as school-based alone or as
school-based with a home or community component. Age and grade level
\u2022 Products for use by or with individuals with disabilities or at
risk for disabilities must be for individuals from infancy through Grade
 12.Products for use by teachers, intervention delivery providers in
early intervention or special education programs, or parents or family
members, must be for serving individuals with or at risk for
disabilities from infancy through Grade 12.Measures and Outcomes All
applicants must include measures of child or student outcomes. By child
or student outcomes, the Department means those measures of development,
 learning, and achievement that are important to parents, teachers, and
school administrators (e.g., school readiness for young children,
grades, achievement test scores, graduation).Transition outcomes for
middle or high school students include the behavioral, social,
communicative, functional, occupational, and academic skills that enable
 young adults with disabilities to obtain and hold meaningful
employment, live independently, and obtain further training and
education (e.g., postsecondary education, vocational education
programs).Other specifications Products may address the needs of
students with disabilities who are also English language learners.The
Department encourages research on high-incidence (e.g., specific
learning disability) and low-incidence disabilities (e.g., visual
impairments).Offerors proposing to study children at risk for
disabilities should present research-based evidence of an association
between risk factors in their proposed sample and the potential
identification of disabilities. The determination of at-risk status must
 be made on an individual child basis and may include, for example,
factors used for moving children to higher tiers in a Response to
Intervention model. The method to be used for determining at-risk status
 should be made explicit in proposals and should be completed as part of
 the sample selection process. Evidence consisting only of general
population characteristics (e.g., labeling children as \u201cat risk for
 disabilities\u201d because they are from low income families or are
English learners) is not sufficient for this purpose. In addition,
identify the disability or disability categories that the sampled
children are at risk of developing.For a Phase I project, the scope of
the proposed project (in terms of time needed to complete the
R\/R&amp;amp;D work and resources needed to do so) must be appropriate
for the Department\u2019s SBIR program. ED recognizes that

Device",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: video\/audio transmission,
video\/audio interoperability, security systems, surveillance cameras,
security cameras, CCTV, incident command, situational
awarenessOBJECTIVE: Develop a prototype video\/audio interoperability
device that enables authorized users to access video security systems
and rebroadcast the signals with the ease of a \u201cplug and play\u201d
 solution.DESCRIPTION: First Responders, such as law enforcement and
incident command managers, rely heavily on video and audio technology to
 increase their situational awareness while onsite at an incident,
monitoring an incident from afar, or conducting day-to-day response.
Security and emergency response operations are often provided for
special events, such as National Security Special Events (NSSE, which is
 defined as an event of national or international significance deemed by
 DHS to be a potential target for terrorism or other criminal activity)
and for various contingency operations with situational awareness often
gathered through the provision of video and audio transmissions that are
 both digital and analog. There is a need for a device that enables plug
 and play capture of video and audio from existing surveillance systems.
 Phase I will design a self-contained concept that will capture video
and audio from security systems commonly implemented by both public and
private entities. Phase II will use the research from Phase I to develop
 and build the prototype device, and conduct field testing.PHASE I: The
objective of Phase I is to design a self-contained concept that will
capture video and audio from closed-circuit and networked security
systems commonly implemented by both public and private entities.The
concept will address how to access the video and audio feed with the
approval of the owners, and rebroadcast it to first responders for
improved situational awareness and providing participant safety. The
concept will enable plug and play access, through hard-wired or wireless
 capability, to the widest array of existing public and\/or private
video security systems for use during an emergency or response
operation. To optimize the ability for authorized DHS components to
readily access on-the-scene information, the concept will consider
characteristics of typical video and audio security systems installed in
 buildings or used to monitor large outdoor areas (such as closedcircuit
 television (CCTV) cameras, networked camera systems, their types of
inputs and outputs, encryption systems, and wireless of
transmissions).Deliverables will include a detailed concept design of a
self-contained, portable interoperability device which enables the
capture and retransmission of video and audio signals. The documentation
 will identify significant types of video surveillance systems (with
estimated percentage of users and complexity of each system type), a
proposed methodology for accessing these systems, any partial or
quick-win solutions for rapid implementation, and a detailed technical
description of the proposed portable device and how it could be used. An
 additional deliverable will outline a plan to prevent unauthorized
parties to acquire and improperly use the device.PHASE II: Based on
Phase I results, construct and demonstrate the operation of a prototype
video interoperability device which enables authorized users to quickly
access public and (with appropriate permissions) private systems, for
the purpose of providing security and situational awareness.Deliverables
 will include a functioning working prototype, a test plan, conduct of a
 laboratory or field test, and user instructions for operation. In
addition, a plan to prevent unauthorized parties to acquire and
improperly use the device will address how to transition the final
prototype to a product and make it available in the marketplace to
authorized users.PHASE III: COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS: The
government application of this technology will be for emergency
management oversight at incident command centers and to provide
situation awareness support at special security events. These
applications may include security, fire, emergency medical services, and
 emergency management.REFERENCES:\u201cClosed-Circuit Television.\u201d

        "topic_name": "Applicability of Blockchain Technology to Privacy
 Respecting Identity Management ",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Identity, Privacy, and
CybersecurityOBJECTIVE: Design information security and privacy concepts
 on the blockchain to support identity management capabilities that
increase security and productivity while decreasing costs and security
risks for the Homeland Security Enterprise (HSE).DESCRIPTION: Blockchain
 technologies, if incorporated with the security and privacy
capabilities required by the HSE, potentially offer a flexible,
resilient and potentially lower cost alternative to current Homeland
Security Enterprise identity management capabilities.Current HSE
identity management deployments utilize centralized authoritative
sources to vouch for the accuracy of the information they collect and
maintain. While mechanisms for storing this information can vary
(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), databases, Active
Directory, etc.), they are ultimately a type of organizationally owned
and controlled ledger.This in turn has led to an ecosystem where
processing a transaction to validate information (e.g., birth date) it
is necessary to (1) first discover the entity that is considered
authoritative for that information, (2) establish the technical means
(protocols, data formats, etc.) to interact with that entity, and (3)
rely upon the ability and scalability of that entity to validate the
information.Potential examples of this type of interaction within the
Homeland Security Enterprise (HSE) are validation of employment status,
citizenship, eligibility to work, validation of qualifications of first
responders and any other type of interaction that requires a central
authority to provide a distributed validation capability.However, recent
 innovations around crypto-currencies point to a potential answer to
this dilemma. Of particular interest is the underlying technology of the
 \u2018bitcoin\u2019 crypto-currency, which is called the blockchain.
The blockchain is in effect a common, public ledger, which utilizes
cryptographic mechanisms to verify transactions and information in a
decentralized manner.The potential applicability of blockchain
technology goes beyond crypto-currencies (which is simply an application
 built on top of that technology) to many other uses such as smart
contracts, provenance and attribution, distributed validation of
information and more.This SBIR topic is focused on determining and
demonstrating if classic information security concepts such as
confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation and provenance
 as well as privacy concepts such as pseudonymity and selective
disclosure of information can be built on top of the blockchain to
provide a distributed, scalable approach to privacy respecting identity
management.PHASE I: Analyze the current implementation of the public
blockchain technology and develop the concepts and methods needed to
demonstrate the implementation of information security principles of
confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation and provenance
 as well as privacy concepts such as pseudonymity and selective
disclosure of information on the public blockchain.This phase will
demonstrate the various information security and privacy concepts and
methods using a multi-user information-sharing prototype and provide
detailed architecture and technical details that document and explain
the implementation. In addition, this phase will explore, analyze and
document the feasibility of applying the developed concepts and methods
to a private or consortium based blockchain.PHASE II: Apply the concepts
 and methods developed in Phase I to the domain of identity management
\u2013 in particular to the assertion and validation of identity
information (i.e., attributes).Phase II will demonstrate via a prototype
 how such a system could interoperate with existing identity assertion,
validation and attribute sharing infrastructure built on top of current
protocols such as SAML 2, OpenID Connect and OAUTH2. It will provide
detailed architectural papers, technical details and prototype code that
 explain and document the implementation. In addition, this phase will
explore, analyze and provide documentation on the incentive structures
that need to be put into place for the adoption of this technology over
the status quo.PHASE III: COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS:
Potential HSE Applications of this technology include attribute
registries used to share emergency responder qualifications, employment
eligibility or organizational affiliations as a precursor to physical
and logical access control. Commercial applications include digital
contracts, attribution of knowledge work and more.REFERENCES:Nakamoto,

and Preemptive Cyber Defense ",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Cyber Security, Cyber Attack
Modeling, Resilient Systems, Situational Awareness, Situational
UnderstandingOBJECTIVE: Develop predictive malware capability and
demonstrate a cyber defense method that uses prediction of malware
developments to support situational understanding and defensive
actionsDESCRIPTION: Situational Understanding for Cyber Security is in
its infancy. Although many tools and methods exist, breaches and
compromises are in the news almost daily, showing that the current
state-of-the-art is ineffective. Hundreds of thousands of unique malware
 samples are collected on a daily basis. With this onslaught of malware,
 new defensive techniques must be developed. Predicting malware
capabilities and malware development would greatly enhance the
situational understanding of cyber defenders. Response to attacks
typically occurs only after infiltration or infection of a system.
Therefore, the defenders are lagging behind the adversaries, granting
attackers a window of success before defensive actions are executed.
Preemptive cyber defense, in which the defender is anticipating the next
 attack rather than responding to the previous one, can shift the
advantage away from the attacker and on to the defender. As a result,
situational understanding is enhanced and cyber defense is improved
because attacks are less effective.Malware-based attacks are a
significant concern to cyber security. Currently, signature-based
detection approaches fail to capture novel malware variants, and are not
 timely, as signatures take days to months to develop. Available
detection techniques based on machine learning are limited because they
are trained on existing sets of malware. Preemptive defense can address
these shortcomings by anticipating what the adversaries will do next.
Attacks can be reduced by identifying trends in malware development and
predicting them over time. Preemptive malware defense requires an
effective capability to predict future malware developments and to
exploit these predictions for situational understanding and to improve
security.This SBIR topic seeks methods of predicting malware
developments, as well as ways of using these predictions to enhance
situational understanding and support malware defense. Predictions which
 are verifiably correct are paramount to the success of the proposed
effort. Thus, meaningful ways of evaluating the predictions should be
defined. Emphasis should also be placed on how the proposed techniques
can be used to enhance situational understand and as part of a malware
defense system.PHASE I: Design a preemptive cyber defense method capable
 of identifying trends in malware and predicting malware developments,
identify ways of validating this method, and describe how it would be
used for enhanced situational understanding and in a defense
system.PHASE II: Create a prototype by implementing the proposed method
in a malware defense system that uses prediction of malware developments
 to improve situational understanding and cyber defense. Specify at
least three appropriate metrics, then validate the prototype with these
metrics.Deliverables for Phase II include validation results of the
prototype, delivery of a prototype suitable for pilot implementation in a
 real world setting with metrics showing enhanced situational
understanding, success of predictive malware efforts, and success of a
preemptive cyber defense method. In addition, there is a requirement to
deliver a plan for Phase III.PHASE III: COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT
APPLICATIONS: This technology will have application in cyber defense
efforts of the Homeland Security Enterprise (HSE), and on the commercial
 market through licensing to software security firms, online providers
of software (i.e., application stores), and Government IT
providers.REFERENCES:Blanch, Rick, \u201cMalware Threats, Trend and

Interoperability, Emergency Preparedness, Response, Community
Resiliency, Smart Devices, WearablesOBJECTIVE: Develop a wearable
capability for autonomous indoor navigation and tracking of first
responders indoors in various types of building structures.DESCRIPTION:
The S&amp;amp;T First Responders Group (FRG) is devoted to meeting the
needs of the first responder community. FRG supports the
community\u2019s ability to protect the homeland and respond to
disasters by ensuring that they have the equipment, technology, and
information they need. This involves leveraging a wide array of
innovative thinkers and ideas through a variety of vehicles. The DHS
S&amp;amp;T Next Generation First Responder (NGFR) program is designing
new technologies and leveraging existing capabilities to solve first
responder problems and make them better protected, connected, and fully
aware. As part of NGFR, this SBIR topic is targeted at meeting a
critical need that previous research and development efforts have not
been able to achieve: accurately tracking first responders indoors.The
development of sensors and communications able to perform well across a
variety of indoor environments is one of the biggest challenges in first
 responder tracking research and development. The ability to use a
Global Positioning System (GPS) is extremely limiting for indoor
tracking capabilities due to its weak signal strength and its inability
to penetrate buildings. There are limited alternatives to GPS, such as
wave measurements, magnetic fields, sonar\/acoustics, etc. Each
alternative comes with both benefits and limitations, and offer varying
levels of tracking capability. Previous research and development
activities have highlighted the significant challenges associated with
indoor tracking. In early 2015, the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) provided rules to ensure commercial cellular carriers and
equipment vendors can come together to field more accurate indoor 911
wireless caller, (i.e., cell phone), location capabilities (see
reference #1 and #2 below) to enable First Responders to derive a
\u201cdispatch-able\u201d address based on the location of the cellular
telephone. In a similar context, FRG is seeking personalized, modular
and scalable approaches to track next generation first responders
indoors using current or emerging technologies, sensors, and techniques.
 The proposed technology must work regardless of materials used in the
building structure, (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, glass or any
combination of building materials), and of varying heights. Ideally, a
solution will be wearable, self-reporting, provide real-time x, y, z
positioning, and will be mission agnostic allowing for use with any
first responder practitioner (e.g., law enforcement, firefighter,
emergency management, etc.).PHASE I: Develop a high level concept of
operations for a next-generation indoor tracking capability that
includes: a listing of the various connected wearable sensors and tools
targeted, as well as relevant first responder use cases for their
application. The concept of operations for this tracking capability
shall include a conceptual, scalable, next-generation architecture that
supports multiple communications networks (e.g., Land Mobile Radio
(LMR), Commercial as well as Public Safety Broadband, Satellite,
Long-Term Evolution (LTE) deployable, Wi-Fi, etc.) connected to existing
 and theoretical first responder devices. It shall also embrace a
standardsbased approach (e.g., Open Geospatial Consortium, BlueTooth,
Zigby). Finally, the concept of operations shall also include a section
outlining the technical feasibility and potential first responder
operational improvement areas.Deliverables include; monthly quad chart
that shows task descriptions, percentage completed, targeted completion
date, etc.; monthly status calls to discuss the monthly technical report
 and quad chart.PHASE II: Based off of work completed in Phase I,
develop a detailed next-generation technical architecture. The
architecture must identify and propose relevant standards, and
interfaces. The offeror must also develop and deliver a minimum of four,
 or more, working prototypes and conduct trials to evaluate the
operational use of the proof of concept based on Phase I use cases. A
comprehensive security assessment must also be provided.Additional
deliverables in Phase II include; monthly quad chart that shows task
descriptions, percentage completed, targeted completion date, etc.;
monthly status calls to discuss the monthly technical report and quad
chart.Finally, there is a requirement to assist DHS S&amp;amp;T
Communications, Outreach and Responder Education (CORE) personnel in the
 development and review of communications materials.PHASE III:
COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS: Based on the results of the Phase
 II trials, there is potential for this technology to be inserted into
S&amp;amp;T\u2019s NGFR program and Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
agents needing tracking capabilities while operating indoors.This
technology could also be leveraged by the commercial sector in market
segments where people or objects need to be tracked indoors, and by
wireless carriers to support FCC Wireless E911 Location Accuracy
Requirements.REFERENCES:FCC Wireless E911 Location Accuracy

Information Sharing; Interoperable Communications; Wireless Emergency
Alerts; Alerts (WEA); Warnings and Notifications; Deployables; Internet
of Things (IoT); Sensor Web Enablement; Mesh NetworkOBJECTIVE: Develop
deployable, low-cost flood inundation sensor for alerts, warnings and
notifications to responders and citizens using IoT Wireless Emergency
AlertsDESCRIPTION: Flooding is the nation\u2019s leading natural
disaster accounting for the greatest loss of life, property damage, and
environmental degradation. Man-made discharge from hydroelectric power
supplies, while a controlled release, can result in life-threatening
situations as the stage\/discharge downstream impacts recreational,
residential and commercial properties and people. Flash flooding can
result in rapid inundation of low-lying areas, underpasses, and critical
 transportation corridors\u2014impacting emergency response, isolating
critical infrastructure, and posing life-threatening situations. The
ability to rapidly predict, detect and react to everchanging flood
conditions requires the ability to monitor flood-prone areas in
real-time across large geographies.Providing flood monitoring across
broad areas requires a scalable mesh network of affordable,
interoperable sensors. The ability to accurately predict and project the
 rise of flood waters requires the design and development of a
ruggedized, modular, deployable (attached to natural or man-made
physical structures), GPS-enabled (x, y and z), submersible, low-cost
flood sensor; it must also have a wireless, sustainable power source
that operates based upon open, webenabled sensor standards that can
leverage an open source IoT architecture design. The flood sensors, and
their associated mesh network, would first relay information through
open data exchange standards for inclusion within an organization\u2019s
 operation center for analysis. From there, information would relay to
hand-held devices through wireless emergency alerting and then to other
IoT sensors for detection and verification.The resulting IoT Flood
Inundation Sensor is expected to be designed and developed in such a way
 to facilitate its commercialization at a commodity-based level to allow
 procurement and adoption by rural, resource-constrained communities in
the United States and around the world.PHASE I: Prepare an engineering
concept report for the design of a modular, low-cost, integrated flood
inundation sensor(s) that meets all of the requirements in the
description, based upon both best available technology and best
affordable technology. The sensor design will be based on current state
of the technology as well as based on requirements derived from DHS
S&amp;amp;T stakeholder community, including the Lower Colorado River
Authority (LCRA) and the Texas Department of Public Safety
(TDPS).Deliverables include; engineering concept report that includes
initial schematic design, modular sensor engineering specifications,
functional characteristics, performance and operational parameters and
target unit cost estimations; monthly quad chart that shows task
descriptions, percentage completed, targeted completion date, etc.;
monthly status calls to discuss technical report and quad chart.PHASE
II: Develop, deploy, test, evaluate, and monitor a prototype of an IoT
low-cost flood inundation sensor(s) mesh network, consisting of a
minimum of 100 viable sensor units, based upon the engineering concept
report design criteria and user requirements from Phase I. Part of the
Phase II effort will be to engage the DHS stakeholders (e.g., LCRA and
TDPS) to determine the mesh network deployment, evaluation and
performance testing acceptance criteria. The assembled sensors, and the
associated application programming interfaces (APIs) necessary to
implement the mesh network protocols, will be provided to and integrated
 with the stakeholder operational centers to perform the operational
test and evaluation. The test and evaluation should be performed no
later than the 18th month of the contract period of performance, over a
period of not less than 4 months to align with the regions annual
flooding periods. The DHS stakeholders will provide in-kind services,
access to subject matter experts, operation center and other
architecture environments necessary to deploy, test and monitor the
sensor network deployment and operation.Phase II deliverables shall
include; kick-off meeting; monthly quad chart that shows task
descriptions, percentage completed, targeted completion date, etc.;
monthly status calls to discuss technical report and quad chart; a
minimum of 100 viable sensors, associated APIs and necessary software
for implementation, technical implementation guidance, test and
evaluation plans, and six (6) months of sensor monitoring and
diagnostics for sensor performance. Performance and evaluation criteria
will be co-developed with S&amp;amp;T and stakeholders. In addition,
there is a requirement to deliver an engineering findings report for
repeatable, scalable commercialization of the IoT Flood Inundation
Sensor network toward the end of the performance period.Finally, there
is a requirement to assist DHS S&amp;amp;T Communications, Outreach and
Responder Education (CORE) personnel in the development and review of
communications materials.PHASE III: COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT
APPLICATIONS: Several flood sensor initiatives highlight the need for
early warning for flooding, especially in developing countries. However,
 even the United States has yet to develop and commercialize a low-cost
flood alert, warning and notification sensor capability to address the
nation\u2019s most common and costly hazard. Over the last 30 years, the
 average losses from flood events have been 89 fatalities and $8.2
billion in damages per year.The DHS stakeholders involved in this
initiative (e.g. LCRA and TDPS) have indicated their interest in
deploying a comprehensive mesh network array across their jurisdictional
 areas of responsibility.In addition to this homeland security
application for flood resiliency and response, other homeland security
and commercial applications for open standards-based, modular components
 could be designed and used toward the following government missions and
 commercial services: audio and visual alerts, reverse 9-1-1, road
closure routing, onboard transceiver and service applications, and a
number of smart city and smart transportation services as an IoT
offering.REFERENCES:Autonomous Field-Deployable Wildland Fire Sensors.

Underserved EMS Agencies",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Communications, predictive
(data) analytics, information sharing, incident response and management,
 operational framework, real-time incident management.OBJECTIVE: A
low-cost, real-time data analytics solution to enable underserved
Emergency Medical Service (EMS) and first responder agencies to improve
quality and responseDESCRIPTION: While the United States has a National
emergency call system, there is no national standard on how these calls
are recorded, reported or stored when someone calls 9-1-1. Without a
standard, communities have selected from a myriad number of Computer
Aided Dispatch (CAD) vendors, each with a proprietary software solution
and an accompanying set of features and cost models. Not only are there
significant differences in the capabilities of these systems, there are
different technical architectures, workflows, and use cases. With over
3,100 counties in the United States and no standards, 9-1-1 incident
data (as recorded in the CAD databases) can vary from county to county,
municipality to municipality, provider to provider and state to state.
With such a broad and disparate set of technologies supporting CAD, EMS
and first responder agencies vary in how they provide operational
response to these call incidents.Further, this wide range of solutions
comes at various costs; this poses a substantial challenge for agencies
that have limited resources. EMS and first responders in many
communities do not have new infrastructure, which limits or eliminates
access to data. Without current and relevant data, change management
processes and continuous quality improvement, which inform and improve
response during emergencies, is limited or non-existent.On the vendor
side, a very limited number of real-time analytic solutions exist today
and they require considerable integration and maintenance. This
requirement further pushes the cost of those solutions beyond the reach
of many underserved EMS agencies. This limitation in the marketplace has
 precluded the ability of underserved EMS agencies to become high
performing EMS agencies.This topic focuses on addressing the need for a
low-cost (or no-cost) data analytics solution that can support EMS and
first responder agencies irrespective of their resource levels. The
solutions needs to be low-\/no- cost, and must operate independent of
proprietary or vendor-specific database architectures, and must enable
real-time access, analysis and reporting of CAD data.The DHS First
Responders Group envisions this early-stage work under SBIR to lay the
groundwork for a broader, innovation that gives thousands of EMS and
first responder agencies the opportunity to become high-performance
organizations. Consistent with S&amp;amp;T\u2019s Visionary Goals of
Enabling the Decision-Maker and Protecting the Responder of the Future,
this work can also seed longer-term efforts to create a national,
standards-based solution that supports realtime or predictive analytics
for timely, actionable response information and that can drive de facto
reporting standards that will enable regional, statewide and nationwide
views of operational incident data.PHASE I: Identify key performance
indicators (KPI) from high performing EMS and first responder agencies
in varied geographic and rural versus urban settings. This Phase will
establish the feasibility of producing a prototype solution that
provides a low cost real-time EMS analytics tool, leveraging the
identified KPIs. Included in the final technical report will be an
analysis of county attributes in different geographic
locations.Deliverables include; monthly quad chart that shows
accomplishments, milestones, activities and risks; monthly status call
to discuss the monthly technical report and quad chart; and quarterly
Interim Project Review (IPR) that includes power point presentation on
the status of the research, preliminary or expected findings, and any
risks associated with work in progress.PHASE II: Using a subset of KPIs
defined in Phase I, develop the data and technical architecture to
support a low cost real-time data analytics prototype. Conduct at least
two pilots or trials that confirm the operational value of the
prototype.Deliverables in Phase II include; monthly quad chart that
shows accomplishments, milestones, activities and risks; monthly status
call to discuss the monthly technical report and quad chart; quarterly
Interim Project Review (IPR) that include power point presentation on
the status of the research, preliminary or expected findings, and any
risks associated with work in progress; and completion of a one page
template, to be provided by DHS S&amp;amp;T FRG, outlining a
communications and outreach for after Phase II (i.e., list of Government
 agencies that will benefit from technology, outreach events that will
provide partnering opportunities, etc.). During Phase II there is a
requirement to assist DHS S&amp;amp;T FRG Communications, Outreach and
Responder Education (CORE) personnel with the development and review of
communications materials.PHASE III: COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT
APPLICATIONS: Based on the strength of Phase II prototypes and
pilots\u2014as well as the strength of a commercialization plan that
facilitates adoption\u2014the capabilities that result from this effort
will provide the foundation of a real-time data analytics solution which
 would be available for any US EMS agency as part of their Continuous
Quality Improvement (CQI) program.However, there is significant
potential for other state, local and commercial healthcare and emergency
 medical services segments to take interest in and\/or invest in
bringing this EMS capability to market if it demonstrates the potential
to influence efficiencies and outcomes for emergency medical care
facilities and professionals.REFERENCES:Lawrence, R. (January 1, 2015).

Disasters and Related Geophysical Studies; Advanced Data Analysis and
Visualization; and Communications &amp;amp; InteroperabilityOBJECTIVE:
Develop an application to assess a community\u2019s posture with respect
 to resilience factors (to be provided by the government) using
open-source data streams such as print and visual media, government data
 bases, and social media.DESCRIPTION: Communities across the United
States are in different states of preparedness for a natural disaster.
Assessing a community\u2019s resilience requires a dedicated, expensive,
 and timeconsuming data collection effort and produces information that
quickly becomes outdated due to ongoing changes in the community. For
example, community planners may invest in a new road construction that
would influence a community\u2019s resilience factor, but was not
captured in the initial data collection. Essentially, evaluating a
community\u2019s resilience using existing methods and technology yields
 a static \u2018snapshot\u2019, which, while useful in the near term, is
 not sufficient to inform federal, state, and local disaster planning
efforts.There is a need for a low-cost, flexible application that can
analyze a community\u2019s resilience on a near real-time basis and
present this information in visual and data formats on mobile and fixed
platforms. The application would access open-source data feeds, such as
print and visual media, social media, and community and state government
 data, and use this information to evaluate a community\u2019s
preparedness using DHS-provided resilience factors.Technical challenges
involve the identification of open-source data that are relevant to
DHSprovided resilience factors and the development of algorithms to
analyze and prioritize these data against the resilience factors. The
application must be able to incorporate new data in real time to support
 an accurate assessment of a community\u2019s resilience state. In
addition, the application must be engineered for deployment on smart
phones, tablets, and PC platforms.PHASE I: Develop a program plan that
outlines the overall system architecture and technology required to
develop the resilience assessment application. The architecture will
specifically identify the targeted open-source data to be used and how
the data will be analyzed and displayed to a user. Include milestones,
description of demonstrations, and a comprehensive technical description
 of the developed application.PHASE II: Develop an application that uses
 open-source data to assess a community\u2019s resilience and provides
results to a user. Test the application\u2019s effectiveness in
providing accurate resilience information (DHS will provide the
community and specific disaster of interest six months after the start
of Phase II) and provide results of the test.Provide a comprehensive
business plan to make the application commercially available to
community, state, commercial, and federal planners.PHASE III: COMMERCIAL
 OR GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS: This technology can strengthen disaster
preparedness and response for government entities such as the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Commerce, as
well as State and local governments, commercial insurance firms, and the
 construction, medical, and foodstuff industries. The data provided
through this application will assist community planners and support
government and private sector decision-making before, during, and after a
 disaster.REFERENCES:Fine Maron, Dina. (June 7, 2013). How Social Media

 Emergency Response Actions ",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Communications, information
sharing, technology acquisition, Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD), data
analytics, social media, crowd-sourcingOBJECTIVE: Develop a data
analytics engine (set of algorithms) to correlate social media comments
and activity with real time agency CAD incident data.DESCRIPTION: Social
 media outlets, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat, to
name a few, have become ubiquitous in the modern world of
communications. During real-world emergency events there potentially
exists a wealth of unstructured information and unverified datasets
about these events that are being shared via social media outlets as the
 events are unfolding. Organizing and correlating this information with
CAD incident data already available to the Incident Command could
greatly improve the effectiveness of response decisions and actions.
This crowd-sourced data, once validated (including an analysis of any
potential false positives) could be correlated with actual real-time
incident data, so that more timely and targeted response actions can be
identified that allow for escalation preparedness throughout the event
timeline.Public Safety, Fire and Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
agencies generally use CAD data to understand actions occurring in the
past. The data is often aggregated around specific quantitative metrics
and does not capture broader, influential external factors including
environmental, social, meteorological, political, economic, and other
factors. The impact of these factors is often only known as part of
post-event analysis as they are not a part of the reportable incident
data set available in the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system during
the event.Identifying the types of influential external
factors\u2014which are often shared via social media\u2014 and
correlating those factors with CAD information can drive an enhanced,
upgraded, or differing response that could impact community preparedness
 and resilience. The resultant actionable data will support decision
making as events unfold (instead of afterward), better; this serves the
community as a whole, reduces risk, and ensures the best use of
resources.PHASE I: Develop a target set of scenarios that would benefit
from social media correlation. Identify the broader external factors,
usually discussed in social media feeds, which can improve situational
insight to the target set of scenarios. Identify the operational
incident (CAD) data that correlates with the social media feeds for the
target set of scenarios. Describe the technical feasibility of
developing algorithms to correlate social media with incident command
data feeds for the target set of scenarios and the potential
improvements in real-time\/response operations.Deliverables include;
monthly quad chart that shows accomplishments, milestones, activities
and risks; monthly status call to discuss the monthly technical report
and quad chart; and quarterly Interim Project Review (IPR) that includes
 power point presentation on the status of the research, preliminary or
expected findings, and any risks associated with work in progress.PHASE
II: Down select to a single target scenario based on Phase I and
development of the set of algorithms to support a pilot protocol by
which a social media feed is correlated with operational incident data.
Establish the validation and trust algorithms that could support more
timely and targeted response actions and allow for escalation
preparedness.Deliverables in Phase II include; monthly quad chart that
shows accomplishments, milestones, activities and risks; monthly status
calls to discuss the monthly technical report and quad chart; quarterly
interim project briefings (IPR) that include power point presentation on
 the status of research, preliminary or expected findings, and risks

Government agencies that will benefit from technology, outreach events
that will provide partnering opportunities, etc.). During Phase II there
 is a requirement to assist DHS S&amp;amp;T FRG Communications, Outreach
 and Responder Education (CORE) personnel with the development and

APPLICATIONS: Based on the results of the Phase II technology, an
integral standardized output format would be developed, which would post
 correlated results to a web dashboard for use by local Public Safety
officials and 9-1-1 communications dispatchers. Once standardized, a

Analytics",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Identity, encryption,
authentication, cyber security, internet of things, and data
analyticsOBJECTIVE: Design a product to support the implementation of
block chain based data management, data analysis, and information
sharing.DESCRIPTION: Blockchain technologies potentially offer a very
flexible, low cost, and secure means of implementing data analytics
architectures. In the virtual currency world, blockchains are
distributed ledgers that keep track of all transactions authenticated by
 thousands of independent users\u2019 machines. This process in crypto
currency, known as mining, inherently makes the ledger extremely
difficult and expensive to hack. The use of machines to authenticate
transactions makes authentication more cost effective. Virtual
currencies like bitcoin have a governing body that manages and updates
the algorithms for transactions and rules for user
participation.Numerous entities \u2013 banks, technology companies, etc.
 \u2013 are exploring blockchain applications for the future. DHS can
benefit from solutions that offer this level of flexibility, security,
accountability and cost.PHASE I: Design and prototype an ecosystem that
supports blockchain technology applications for data analytics that
significantly improve DHS mission and operations. Proposed use cases
include, but are not limited to, crypto-certified data and\/or analytic
transactions involving users and devices for the internet-of-things
applications (IoT) such as encrypted sensor data transactions and
analytics for first responders; information sharing and analysis between
 state, local, and federal law enforcement; and third party information
sharing architectures involvement, perhaps in applications that improve
security and experiences for the traveling public, or that improve
bio-threat awareness. Offerors may define and propose relevant use cases
 and architectural concepts where there is a significant value
proposition for the homeland security enterprise.Proposed solutions can
involve open or closed environment blockchain applications. For example,
 open environments, such as cryptocurrencies, where anyone can
participate. There are also closed-permissions based environments where
community involvement may be controlled by participants. Regardless of
the architecture, privacy is an important DHS priority for use cases
that might involve any personally identifiable information (e.g.,
biographical, biometric). National computer, network and information
security policies and standards are also important considerations for a
viable solution that involves government participation. For scalability,
 solutions must also consider speed of analysis and any transaction
validation features.In Phase I, the application ecosystem will be
developed for data management that will include a data analytics
methodology and approach for applying blockchain technology to
significantly improve or enable homeland security applications and use
cases. Produce an architecture that leverages existing or creates
algorithms and computational techniques where practicable; show how
components and services function in the ecosystem; and develop an
approach for building and maintaining this ecosystem. Demonstrate
and\/or document implementation feasibility with respect to: concept of
operations, crypto-certified data transactions, governance models,
analytic framework, analytic algorithms, costs, privacy protection and
security. Identify risks to privacy, security, operational performance
and technology and develop appropriate risk mitigation strategies.PHASE
II: Prototype, or expand on the prototype, developed in Phase I for the
blockchain data management ecosystem(s), including the development of
software services and design, and implementation of any equipment
needed. Implement, expand, refine and characterize the performance of
system modules and algorithms. Demonstrate prototype(s) and algorithms
in a laboratory environment with data that reflects proposed homeland
security applications and use cases. Demonstrate the value proposition
of general core capabilities by developing and demonstrating multiple
but disparate applications from the same core product capabilities.
Refine the architecture and technical approach based on feedback from
the government and marketplace as appropriate for selected applications.
 Initiate transition\/commercialization options that leverage the
strengths of demonstrated results, market demand and homeland security
value propositions.In Phase II, the software ecosystem prototype will be
 delivered and made available to the government for assessment. This can
 happen through the delivery of preliminary software, equipment, or
cloud based platform access.PHASE III: COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT
APPLICATIONS: Blockchain technologies stand to radically transform
options for data management, sharing and analysis across government.
Because of the significant impact in areas such as governance, data
sharing agreement enforcement, and encrypted analytics interchanges,
there are a wide variety of applications in government and the
commercial marketplace that can benefit from successful product
development. Information sharing for the homeland security enterprise
can help the DHS security operations across components as well as the
state fusion centers. Additionally, such technologies can assist with
resolving matters related to disaster response, where a variety of
public and private resources are required to inform decision making at
all levels of government and for individuals.REFERENCES:Maras, Elliot.

        "topic_name": "Remote Identity Proofing Alternatives to
Knowledge Based Authentication\/Verification",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Identity, Fraud, and
CybersecurityOBJECTIVE: Design and demonstrate the feasibility of high
assurance alternatives to knowledgebased verification techniques for
population scale remote identity proofing.DESCRIPTION: The vast majority
 of organizations remotely identity proof an individual using a
Knowledge Based Verification (KBV) or Knowledge Based Authentication
(KBA) technique; i.e., by asking them \u201csecret\u201d questions that
only they can supposedly answer to prove their identity.As shown by the
recent Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data breach, KBV is broken and
rapidly becoming less effective as a verification tool as a by-product
of the availability of personal information on social media as well as
the variety of data breaches of credit bureaus and data brokers. This
availability of personal information has led to situations where answers
 to these \u201csecret\u201d questions can easily be discovered with a
minimal level of effort by a determined fraudster who can then use that
information to impersonate an individual.At a high level, identity
proofing of an individual is a three step process consisting of (1.)
identity resolution (confirmation that an identity has been resolved to a
 unique individual within a particular context, i.e., no other
individual has the same set of attributes), (2.) identity validation
(confirmation of the accuracy of the identity as established by an
authoritative source) and, (3.) identity verification (confirmation that
 the identity is claimed by the rightful individual).This SBIR topic is
focused on investigating identity verification alternatives to KBV\/KBA
that provide varying levels of assurances of identity for remote
identity proofing. Potential techniques to be explored include, but are
not limited to, biological or behavioral characteristic confirmation - a
 process that compares biological (anatomical and physiological)
characteristics in order to establish a link to an individual where
facial photo comparison, trusted referee confirmation - a process that
relies on a trusted referee to establish a link to an individual
(guarantors, notaries and certified agents are examples of trusted
referees), and physical possession confirmation - a process that
requires physical possession or presentation of evidence to establish an
 individual\u2019s identity.PHASE I: Identify and define five or more
non-KBV\/KBA approaches that exist in practice and in theory to
establish a link between a particular set of data and an individual.
Perform an analysis to determine the technical feasibility of each
approach as well as the threats and potential mitigations for each
approach.PHASE II: Analyze and rank the approaches, or combination of
approaches, identified in Phase I based on the assurances of identity
they provide.In addition, to the extent feasible, provide a mapping to
the levels of identity assurances as articulated by standards
organizations such as International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Provide
 an analysis of the various approaches that take into account identity
assurance, data privacy, and user experience. Using data from the
analysis, develop, demonstrate, and validate the most promising
approaches that provide the best combination of identity assurance,
privacy and user experience via a prototype using existing standardized
identity protocols such as Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML
2.0) or OpenID Connect \/ OAUTH2.PHASE III: COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT
APPLICATIONS: Potential Homeland Security Enterprise (HSE) Applications
of this technology include all digital services delivered by government
to its citizens, employees or partners that require remote identity
proofing.Commercial applications include all high assurance applications
 requiring proof of identity.REFERENCES:Office of Management and Budget.

Actual Radiation Detection, Identification, and Localization",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Radiation Detection; Virtual
Radionuclide Identification; Localization, Human-machine interface,
Instrumentation, Human Factors, Psychology, Display systemsOBJECTIVE:
Successful research would lead to the development and demonstration of a
 userfriendly and straightforward smartphone\/smart device toolkit for
radiation detection, identification, and localization based on the
presence of a simulated or virtual radiological source. Later phase
device will be able to interface with actual detector to provide same
functionality using data generated by detector resulting in near-perfect
 fidelity between training and operations.DESCRIPTION: DNDO is
requesting proposals that lead to the development of a simple-to-use and
 operate radiation source training and operational toolkit that contains
 the following:A display output with design developed from basic
research (survey, observation, SME input) into user needs during actual
operational use of fielded instruments. Initial phase will result in
optimum user-centered interface responding to a virtual source. Later
phase will result in identical interface responding to actual data
received from PRD, basic hand held and back pack style detectors.Display
 will have a virtual and active mode.Display may be able to either fit
over current instrument hardware or be able to be injected directly into
 hardware.Tool is able to track the location of the search personnel
compared to the placement of the virtual source for purposes of
estimating the detector response, such as through Bluetooth beacons,
Wi-Fi, or other equivalent means.Selectable ability to change the
detector readout types and sensitivity for the purposes of training on
multiple detection equipment.Output includes estimates of dose and dose
rate.Source location, isotopic signature, intensity, and occluding
background environment can be programmed for training purposes.The
application may support several modes of operation within existing
detection systems to include detection, localization, and
identification.Later phase tool able to interface with actual detectors
providing identical display with selectable menu based on detector
capability using detector generated data.PHASE I: The Offeror shall
provide the basic research into optimum human machine interface. Most
useful instrumentation\/displays for real-world operations at the State
and Local level. Most common information required for most effective
warnings. Research shall be used to design instrumentation of user
interface\/instrument display. Additional research would lead to an
innovative virtual mock-up which successfully demonstrates the ability
of a smart device application to effectively determine the distance of
the user from the virtual source, calculate dose and dose rate, and
estimate location, signature, and intensity of a source. Offerors would
also deliver a prototype user interface capable of supporting multiple
modes of operation as described above. Additionally, the Offeror shall
deliver a detailed analysis of predicted performance, establish baseline
 metrics, and include monthly progress and final technical reports as
part of the standard Phase I deliverables.PHASE II: Phase II efforts
shall focus on the validation and verification of simulated results in
various operational environments, including those with background
occlusion. Further, the Offeror shall be able to demonstrate that the
performance of this virtual model exceeds the previously established
baseline metrics set forth in Phase I. Efforts should roll into
development of digital architecture for app based display that would
allow virtual mode interface be duplicated and provide real-time data
from actual detectors. The efforts would result in demonstration of a
smart device tool that uses same instrumentation as virtual tool, but
provides actual detector data. This will lead to the development of open
 architecture standards for smart device interface with R\/N equipment
hardware. Open architecture will spawn innovation in turning standard
digital data into innovative displays and innovative information
transfer solutions that provide near-perfect fidelity between training
and operational use.The end of the second year Phase II efforts should
culminate into a robust and standalone smartphone\/device app or
toolkit, adjustable to emulate detector responses and to interface with
actual commonly used detectors (PRD, BHH, Back pack). Display would have
 selectable features compatible with detector capability standardizing
display features for family of commonly used detection equipment.PHASE
III - COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS: Efforts should focus on
developing partnerships and collaborations with R\/N OEMs, other
Government, State, and Local emergency response organizations for a
successfully transition of the resulting smartphone\/device
application(s) as a standard all-encompassing equipment solution toolkit
 to facilitate training, operations and exercises. Developer could
commercialize as optimum app based display\/ Interface solution that can
 provide both training and operational functionality. Device could be
marketed on near perfect fidelity for training and interface solution
that would negate training gaps between commonly used equipment (PRD,
Handheld, Back pack). This toolkit could be further expanded to include
testing of new and more advanced detection, identification, or
localization algorithms developed by DHS research and development
efforts. This toolkit could be further expanded to include additional
advanced human machine interfaces to support operational
constraints.REFERENCES:http:\/\/www.infoworld.com\/article\/2608498\/mobile-apps\/what-you-need-to-know-about-usingbluetooth-beacons.htmlKEY

        "topic_name": "Plastic Composite Based Scintillators for
Multi-Signature Radiation Detectors",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREAS: Radiation detection,
radionuclide identification, plastic scintillatorsOBJECTIVE: Demonstrate
 a simple-to-fabricate-and-integrate detector technology that combines
gamma and neutron sensitivity with good efficiency at a reduced cost
compare to the current COTS scintillators.DESCRIPTION: There are
considerable benefits in being able to acquire multiple signatures when
detecting and identifying radiation sources. While gamma rays can
provide highly detailed information alone, they can also be easily
masked and misconstrued amongst the many possible sources of industrial,
 medical and normally occurring sources that might be encountered. For
this reason, augmenting with neutron detection is highly valuable,
especially in determining the presence of fissionable materials (SNM).
Characterizing neutrons by energy is even more powerful, but often
requiring distinctly different detector types.Recent advances in
scintillator technology (e.g. elpasolite, stilbene-based, or advanced
plastic detectors) make possible both gamma and thermal neutron
detection with a single element. The sensor material cost is a
significant driver of the overall detector cost, therefore a
\u2018multi-mode\u2019 detector approach can shall provide significant
value for its enhanced performance. Nevertheless, these new technologies
 are relatively expensive for wide-spread deployment.DNDO seeks
plastic-crystal composite solutions that can achieve both multi-modality
 and substantial cost reductions in sensors that are compatible with
backpack and handheld instrumentation. Included in the cost calculation
is not only the cost to fabricate the scintillator crystals or plastics,
 but the cost of integrating these gamma\/neutron sensitive materials
into a detector. Proposed composite scintillators shall include, but are
 not limited to a plastic framework comprised of another radiation
sensitive material (larger than molecular scale) distributed into the
plastic contributing to multi-modality detector sensitivity. The
proposal should address the following objectives:Price goals should be
$5\/cm3 or less.Neutron-gamma discrimination should exceed 10-6 .Gamma
ray detection performance shall be better than 1\u201d x 1\u201d NaI
single scintillators (7% energy resolution FWHM at 662 keV).Successful
solutions shall leverage the cost effective approach and enhanced
detector performance of a combined plastic and radiation sensitive
material into a plastic-crystal composite. The most successful
technology will provide a compelling combination of gamma ray energy
spectroscopy (measured at 662 keV), gamma ray and neutron sensitivity,
and cost per unit volume.PHASE I: The Offeror shall propose a
plastic-crystal composite material that can demonstrate multi-mode
sensitivity to both gamma rays and neutrons (with separable signals, or
discrimination). Neutron detection should also be quantified and
compared to current commercially available hand held technologies.
Provide trade-off studies and modeling of detector sensitivity as a
foundation for Phase II development.Develop a preliminary cost model
that describes the Offeror\u2019s plan to manufacture the technology and
 highlight those factors which are most highly impacted by acquisition
scale. It is expected that in Phase II, this model will be updated as
the underlying processes mature.PHASE II: Optimize the underlying
technologies and demonstrate fully-sized examples of the working
detectors. Develop all packaging and ancillary electronics that may be
needed to fully evaluate the detectors, including the capability to
discriminate signal types (which should be fully integrated). Produce
packaged detector sizes capable of supporting gamma and neutron
detection requirements for handheld and backpack systems.Further
investigation on how this technology could be made available for
instrumentation to OEMs, including consideration of accompanying readout
 requirements.PHASE III - COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS:
Handheld and backpack multi-mode gamma\/fast neutron\/ thermal neutron
detectors will strongly benefit from this technology, which will allow
their mass deployment in homeland security applications. In addition, it
 can be used in control of nuclear material diversion and proliferation,
 for accountability of the materials in nuclear facilities, and in
safeguards applications. Large area, low cost, gamma-neutron monitoring
systems can be also realized.REFERENCES:N. D'Olympia, at al "Optimizing

replacementOBJECTIVE: Develop and commercialize a portable accelerator
for active interrogation systems and approaches. The portable
accelerator shall replace radiological gamma isotope sources currently
used for commercial non-medical applications.DESCRIPTION: In the past
few years, Congress and various Government agencies have recognized the
problem of orphaned radioactive sources worldwide. Such sources pose a
security risk in the form of potential material for a \u201cdirty
bomb\u201d or for other illicit applications. DNDO is seeking
alternatives to the radioactive gamma sources used in commercial
off-the-shelf products such as oil well logging and soil density gauges.
 The goal is to dramatically reduce the amount of radioactive material
in the commercial market in order to improve public safety and prevent
the threat of Radiation Dispersion Devices (RDD). Solutions must be able
 to directly replace commercial sealed sources used in industry and be
competitive with size and cost. They must also achieve the full
capabilities of existing systems, but not require the use of a
radioactive nuclear material. Their size, weight, and power requirements
 must not be so onerous as to prevent their use under the conditions
normally envisioned for the application. Lastly, they must be
sufficiently robust to withstand the temperatures, pressures, humidity,
vibration, and shock encountered in the typical operating environment
for the application. Furthermore, these technologies could also have
applicability in other aspects of the DNDO mission to include portable
active interrogation systems for detection of shielded Special Nuclear
Material (SNM).DNDO is seeking the development of an accelerator
specifically for human portable non-medical industrial applications with
 further applicability to portable active interrogation systems. The
proposed accelerator shall meet the following specifications:Weight:

(design, data, simulation, analytic calculation, references, etc.) must
be provided to justify expectations that program has reasonable chance
of successfully achieving its goals.PHASE I: Demonstrate the feasibility
 of the proposed technical approach with a benchtop prototype or
preliminary design. The physics of critical design elements should be
well described.PHASE II: Development will continue with fabrication and

the source for both cooking and keeping warm is a simple fire pit
surrounded by three large stones arranged to keep a cooking surface
above the flames. The World Health Organization estimates that indoor
air pollution from such cooking fires contributes to nearly two million
premature deaths annually.The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves is
coordinating a multi-national, multi-disciplinary effort to address the
need for better cookstoves in developing countries. Its approach
involves enhancing demand for clean cookstoves and fuels, strengthening
the supply of clean cookstoves and fuels, and fostering the enabling

cookstove performance in the laboratory and in the field.The need for
electrical power is increasingly being added to the needs for cooking
and providing heat in homes in developing countries. A technical
challenge is to integrate all three capabilities into a single
technology that could work in such conditions. Therefore, EPA is looking
 for the development and commercialization of:2A: Integrated cooking,

EconomiesSubtopic 8.1.1F Improving Outcomes of Marine Aquaculture via
Genomic Approaches Summary: In comparison to human medicine or land
based agriculture, the genomic basis for improving marine aquaculture
breeding outcomes is in its infancy. Most aquaculture facilities rely on
 batch spawning and trial and error. There is little chance of
identifying individual parents and the specific genetic traits that
provide eggs and larvae with superior qualities of growth, feed
conversion and disease resistance. The sequencing of the human genome
took 10 years and 3 billion dollars. The cost of genome sequencing has
declined to &amp;lt;10 days and &amp;lt; 1,000 per human genome. Perhaps
 more important non-model genomes such as abalone, yellowtail (Seriola
sp.) bluefin tuna, and rock scallop can be developed based on linkages
to data bases from better studied biomedical model organisms such as the
 zebrafish. NOAA resource managers and the aquaculture industry seeks
assistance in developing high-throughput, low cost methods to conduct
pedigree analyses, and to identify and routinely screen for functional
genes associated with favorable growth characteristics and genes
associated with disease sensitivity and resistance.Project Goals:
Genetic trait selection is an integral part of land based agriculture
and has revolutionized the production of corn, rice and soybeans.
Atlantic salmon is the only marine species to undergo extensive
selective breeding. Concerns over escapement from offshore farms, the
need to recover endangered species via hatchery rearing, as well as
consumer preference, dictates that the domestication of newer
aquaculture species such as yellowtail and the stock enhancement of
natural populations of depleted abalone must rely on a full
understanding and the retention of mostly wild genetic characters, but
it must also weed out the inferior spawning stock with each broodstock
collection and spawning event. Assistance from the private biotech
community is critical to developing rapid, cost-effective screening
procedures designed for pedigree analysis, genomic trait selection to
improve outcomes of aquaculture, and monitor the success of out-planting
 as a means of wild stock recovery. While the ultimate goal might be
commercial biotech kits that could be sold to hatchery managers (similar
 to a modern pregnancy kit), the immediate and perhaps longer term
economic model would be to provide a continuing fee-for-service business
 to support hatchery managers.Phase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables:Activities Include:Identification of a family of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to allow parent-offspring and kinship
analyses in a candidate aquaculture species among the tuna family
(Scombridae), jack family (Carangidae), the drum and croaker family
(Sciaenidae), or the abalone genus (Haliotis). This could include
Pacific bluefin tuna, yellowtail jack, white seabass, or red abalone.
Genetic screening of existing data bases for identification of
trait-associated genes in a candidate aquaculture species among the tuna
 family (Scombridae), jack family (Carangidae), the drum and croaker

Pacific bluefin tuna, yellowtail jack, white seabass or red abalone.
Deliverables include:A next-generation SNP assay or similar approach to
identify parent-offspring relationships that is not dependent on
conventional micro-satellite or sequence based approaches. A roadmap to
the development of a high-throughput, low cost automated assay of
parent-offspring relationships in a hatchery environment. A roadmap to

Developing Technologies for Offshore Aquaculture in The United States
Summary: Offshore aquaculture refers to aquaculture in the waters
between state maritime boundaries and the end of the Exclusive Economic
Zone (EEZ). Offshore aquaculture has the potential to complement wild
harvest fisheries, increase our domestic supply of safe, healthy seafood
 and contribute to resilient coastal communities and economies. There is
 huge opportunity for offshore aquaculture development in the United
States. The U.S. EEZ is the largest in the world, spanning a wide range
of ocean conditions and habitats. Less than 0.01% of the U.S. EEZ could
potentially produce up to 600,000 metric tons or more per year of an
equally wide range of farmed aquatic species. Dozens of commercial
operations around the world currently use offshore aquaculture
technologies, and U.S. companies, investors, and farmers have
participated in this global aquaculture industry by exporting
technology, equipment, seedstock, services, investment and feed. With
the development and impending implementation of the Fishery Management
Plan for Regulating Offshore Aquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico, the
United States is poised to grow its domestic offshore aquaculture
industry. With this growth will come new challenges to working in
remote, offshore environments, and a range of technologies will be
needed to address logistical and environmental issues. Proposals are
requested for research towards innovative products and services to
specifically develop offshore aquaculture capabilities for finfish,
shellfish, or seaweeds. Priority is given to research that addresses
technology bottlenecks to developing domestic offshore aquaculture
operations and in turn increase our sustainable seafood supply, protect
our ocean resources, and create economic opportunities for coastal
communities. Project Goals: New technologies, products and methods are
needed to address challenges in developing offshore aquaculture for
finfish, shellfish, and seaweeds. Projects that would support production
 improvements can include but are not limited to: technologies, methods
or products that address offshore farming technologies , preventing
risks from escapes (such as sterile stock), development of tools for
management, remote and\/or real-time monitoring, transportation,
facility maintenance, and harvest, feeds for offshore culture,
preventing disease transfer, and hatchery technology. Priority will be
given to proposals that specifically target and address issues
associated with offshore aquaculture and the unique challenges it
presents. Phase I Activities and Expected Deliverables: Activities
Include: Develop high probability solutions to key bottleneck issues.
Execute research and development of techniques and management measures
to address these bottlenecks. Explore commercialization opportunities
(preliminary business planning) Deliverables include: Proof of concept
at the lab or bench scale Refinement of products or solutions
Commercialization plan with permit requirements, preliminary enterprise
budgets and business plan Technical Report showing commercial
application of developed technology\/technique and research results.
Phase II Activities and Expected Deliverables: Activities Include:

 in Phase I. Further refinement and\/or expansion of product or
solutions Refinement of profit\/loss models, enterprise budgets and
business plan Deliverables include: Detailed report on developed

 &amp;nbsp;Subtopic 8.1.3F Orthogonal Stereo Camera System for Visual
Fish Surveys Summary: NOAA Fisheries is mandated to provide the best
scientific information available to establish conservation and
management measures for the sustainability of our Nation\u2019s living
marine resources and healthy oceans. One national priority relevant to
this mission is the need resolve data-limited fish assessments. Many of
the data-limited assessments result directly from the inability to
effectively sample rocky and reef habitats. The scientific community has
 relied on camera systems deployed along the bottom to provide counts
and measures for assessments. One research approach is the accurate
synchronization of paired stereo cameras which provide the counts and
precise length measurements of fish during camera surveys. Another
research approach is the use of multiple synchronized pair stereo
cameras where their view fields are orthogonally arranged and stitched
to provide a 360 degree horizontal view to eliminate double counting
targets while providing accurate length measures (to 0.5 cm accuracy).
Research has demonstrated that the use of paired stereo cameras with
sufficient accuracy in \u201csynchronization\u201d and \u201cstitched
view fields\u201d have significantly improved abundance estimates for
assessments; however to date, commercially available stereo camera
systems lack the accuracy in \u201csynchronization\u201d and
\u201cstitched view fields\u201d for scientific data collections. There
is consensus (and market) among fisheries scientists within the agency
and among the international scientific community regarding a need for an
 off-the-shelf (easy to use turn-key) orthogonal stereo camera system
with accurate \u201csynchronization\u201d and \u201cstitched view
field\u201d capabilities that could be widely deployed to improve visual
 fish survey operations to resolve data-limited stock assessments in
difficult to sample reef and rocky habitats. Project Goals: An
orthogonal stereo camera system needs to be designed and commercialized
to provide accurate \u201csynchronization\u201d and \u201cstitched view
fields\u201d among multiple stereo cameras to enable accurate counting
and measuring (length to within 0.5 cm) of fish during scientific
underwater visual surveys. Researchers have investigated the
applicability of using accurately synchronized stereo cameras for
measuring fish length and recommend arranging multiple pairs of
synchronized stereo cameras orthogonally and horizontally to stitch the
stereo view fields together to provide a horizontal 360 degree sampling
field will prevent double counting of fish. Although there are
underwater stereo cameras and spherical cameras that are commercially
available, there are no commercial products that provide sufficiently
accurate \u201cstereo camera synchronization\u201d and accurate
\u201cstitching between multiple synchronized stereo cameras\u201d that
can be utilized for visual fish surveys providing precise fish length
measurements to the nearest 0.5 cm. There is a need to develop and
commercialize an orthogonal stereo camera system with these features
that is easily to deploy and use, including clear protocols for its
calibration, operation, and performance metrics. Another system feature
that researchers have investigated is an optional fish detection trigger
 (through active acoustic and\/or far-field infrared detection) which
minimizes data collect for only detected targets having applicability
for prolonged deployments. Although this is not a requirement for this
SBIR, it is important to recognize this might be an optional feature
that is desired by the scientific community. There is sufficient
research published to guide the specifications of developing and
commercializing a standardized low-cost stereo camera system with these
requirements that will be widely used for visual fish surveys both
domestically and internationally. This orthogonal stereo camera system
will wide international applicability for the data-limited regions that
require stakeholder engagement, therefore its operation must be
relatively simple and reliable. The goal of commercializing this
portable underwater stereo camera system is to provide a low cost and
reliable tool that will be widely deployed in standardized visual fish
surveys to resolve data-limited stock assessments. There is a need to
commercialize an orthogonal stereo camera system for visual fish surveys
 to accurately identify, count, measure fish per unit sampling volume.
Underwater stereo cameras have recently become available as commercial
products; however none of these existing products are designed with
accurate \u201csynchronization of stereo cameras\u201d and accurate
\u201cstitching of view fields of multiple stereo camera units\u201d for
 providing accurate fish length measures (to the nearest 0.5 cm) from
scientific visual fish surveys. Therefore, the NOAA mission and the
wider scientific community would benefit from the development and
commercial availability of an orthogonal stereo camera system with
accurate \u201csynchronization\u201d and \u201cview field
stitching\u201d that can be deployed for visual fish surveys. An
orthogonal stereo camera system with accurate \u201csynchronization
between stereo cameras\u201d and accurate \u201cstitching of stereo
camera view fields\u201d to count fish and accurately measure fish
length to the nearest 0.5 cm within a 360 degree horizontal view around
the system to be deployed on the seafloor (to depths of 500 meters)
during visual fish surveys. This orthogonal stereo camera arrangement
should have the ability to capture high definition (HD) video (at least
1080p at 30 f\/s) or capture HD still images (at least 6 megapixels) to
count, identify, and accurately measure fish (accuracy within 0.5 cm) in
 the 360 degree sampling volume around the system with the intent of
reducing double counting of fish. Camera must have minimal lens
distortion to obtain accurate fish length measurements using stereo
camera imaging. The cameras must have low light sensitivity (at least
0.2 lux @ f 1.4). An optional feature that enables a fish detection
trigger is desirable to capture digital fish images. The system could
include an optional feature of synchronized lighting or strobed modules
synchronized to the stereo camera units for capturing digital fish
images at night or low light conditions. The system should be relatively
 user-friendly turn-key operation with clear operational instructions.
Software needed for calibration of stereo camera modules and lens
distortion compensation to achieve accurate and precise fish length
measurements to the nearest 0.5 cm within the sampling volume at various
 angles of fish orientation. Software interface for accurate
synchronization, operation data collection and data storage. Software is
 needed for data export with metadata and post processing (i.e.,
stitching sampling fields of the orthogonal stereo cameras, fish counts
and length measurements). The system must contain sufficient data
storage capacity for continuous HD video recording for duration of 2
hours with data downloading capability. Phase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables: Activities include:Explore the feasibility in building out
 an orthogonal stereo camera for visual fish surveys to accurately
identify, count, measure fish per unit sample volume. Provide proof of
concept in ensuring the stereo cameras (either two or more) is
synchronized. Deliverables include: Progress Reports and Detailed Final
Report as outlined in solicitation Provide design and technical report
for (and any white papers associated with) the camera Provide prototype

Affordable, lightweight, wireless-control ROV for sustained observation
of benthic ecosystems Summary: Conserving coastal places provides
economic benefits to local communities. These communities rely on
dollars spent on activities such as recreation and tourism. NOAA's
National Ocean Service works to conserve marine areas \u2014 and
preserve the economic benefits of these special places to local
communities through its coastal management and place-based conservation
programs. National Marine Sanctuaries are mandated to fulfill this
placed-based conservation and through our research we are working to
understand the natural and anthropogenic changes and interactions
occurring at Gray's Reef.Traditional neutral buoyancy ROVs (Remotely
Operated Vehicles) have more flexibility with endurance underwater by
way of the powered umbilical connecting it to the surface operating
station. Unfortunately, currents, wave action and underwater stability
inconveniently limit long term studies at many sites due to the
complexities of the vessel support station needing constant maneuvering
to keep from dragging the ROV from its subject of study. Scuba divers,
neutral buoyancy ROVs, and the vessels that support them are loud and
behave awkwardly and invasively compared to the natural environment
surrounding them. This awkward, intrusive behavior results in altered
organism behavior thus altering the study itself. A benthic ROV operated
 wirelessly from the surface can eliminate much of the altered
behaviors. The divers are no longer present. With a wireless benthic
ROV, the constant maneuvering of the neutral buoyancy ROV is removed and
 reduced to a slow crawl or no movement at all. This is very important
in the study of fishes as the loud and disruptive noise from the support
 vessel can be eliminated by providing some distance to the surface
communications of the crawler. Once the ROV is positioned onto the study
 site, it can monitor and film its subject silently and without
movement. While it is filming, payloads on the chassis such as
scientific sensors are also quietly recording data and delivering both
the video and data in real time to the surface by way of the wireless
transmissions from surface buoy to support station. Government agencies,
 universities, private organizations and citizens conduct thousands of
dives each year studying the waters beneath our global oceans, lakes,
and rivers worldwide. NOAA\u2019s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries
and the wider ocean science research and education community would
benefit from an affordable (under $15,000.00), lightweight, benthic ROV
that communicates wirelessly from its support station (vessel, shore,
etc.). To our knowledge, this technology does not exist in the wireless
capacity; however there is ample evidence it is needed to accomplish
studies over a period of time much longer than that allowed by a scuba
diver or the limited resources of the support vessel\/station in terms
of fuel and personnel. In addition, non-diving personnel should be able
to provide direct observations of a reef or its inhabitants, even tiny
macro video subjects, in real time without going to the seafloor.Project
 Goals: Currently commercially available benthic ROVs are proprietary
hardware and software and the ability of the end user to easily
customize, repair, or extend the hardware or software capabilities is
very limited, and thus NOAA personnel are at the mercy of the
manufacturer for support. NOAA personnel should be able to have the
control to modify their crawler platform to meet NOAA's changing mission
 requirements, via commercially available components, access to all
spare parts at low cost, and open source software with full access to
all source code. The ROV should be a platform which NOAA personnel have
full ability to customize, extend, reconfigure, adapt, and repair.For an
 operator aboard a nearby surface vessel to most effectively control the
 robot in real time, the communications and control link between
operator and robot should be wireless, allowing the surface vessel
freedom from constant maneuvering to precisely station-keep above the
robot as it would if it were directly tethered to it. This reduces both
manpower required to pilot the vessel while operating the rover and
reduces the cost of fuel otherwise consumed in station-keeping. A
wireless communication link also allows the operation of the robot from
shore.Most currently available benthic ROVs are designed for greater
than 1000 meter depths. While essential for doing deep ocean surveys,
this high level of performance (and the inevitable high cost to achieve
it) is unnecessary for shallow water surveys such as those typical in
the majority of the NOAA National Marine Sanctuaries such as Gray's
Reef, Thunder Bay, Channel Islands, Florida Keys, American Samoa,
Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whaler and others.A benthic ROV designed for
the littoral zone incorporating a wireless link can be much lower in
cost and complexity. This allows NOAA and the scientific community to
acquire more of these vehicles and perform more surveys per dollar while
 also obtaining the cost benefits of reduced manpower required for
operation, easier operator training, and greatly reduced vessel fuel
consumption.Even in a well-surveyed Sanctuary like Gray's Reef, many
fundamental questions have not been answered. Example: Does this species
 of fish stay in one area, or wander down the reef over 24 hours? How
far does it go? Conducting such a behavior survey involving physically
following an organism at unpredictable times over an unpredictable
distance would require close coordination of multiple teams of divers
doing as many as 24 separate dives (at 60 feet), and a massive logistic
and diver support operation. An event whose time of occurrence may be
unpredictable such as the time of night an octopus leaves its lair to
hunt and when it returns can be difficult to capture for divers with a
50 or 60 minute no-decompression dive limit (especially when divers with
 their noise, motion and bubbles would have to hover around in front of
its lair).A benthic ROV with a high-definition camera recharged from the
 surface could follow the organism across the seafloor thereby
completing such a survey efficiently and easily. Currently, to complete
that survey with any commercially available benthic robot operated via a
 tether wire directly connected to a surface vessel operator control
unit (OCU) the vessel would need to continuously run its engines to
maintain constant course corrections to keep station above the rover and
 so as not to drag it along the seafloor. An untethered radio link of
approx. one mile range is desired to allow the vessel some distance from
 the study site.System Minimum RequirementsWet Weight Environmental

western Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico are currently
experiencing a rapidly expanding and seemingly uncontrolled invasion by
Indo-Pacific lionfish. In the last 15 years, populations have grown
beyond our ability to control them by traditional response modes \u2013
diver removal, for example. Impacts to reef communities are being
observed in many locations, with predation rates that can remove up to
70% of the forage base of other reef fish. Lionfish now occupy depths
down to 1000 feet, and are in very high densities in many places, the
vast majority of which are below diving depths, and they appear to have
no currently functioning natural controls. Lionfish have been caught in
deep water in some traditional traps, principally lobster traps, and
some by hook-and-line, but in insufficient numbers to control
populations. Project Goals: Most fish traps currently in use are not
considered environmentally friendly. They can damage habitats, and most
are non-selective, capturing and containing fish throughout their
deployment period, and subjecting them to predation by other animals
that enter the trap. They also produce by-catch, which are non-targeted
animals (for example, eels, sharks and grunts in traps intended for
other reef fish). The by-catch often dies before it can be released back
 to the sea, and much that is released cannot return to the bottom
because gases that expand in the fish during ascent cause them to be too
 buoyant to swim back to the bottom on their own. These animals,
invariably under heightened stress, are often eaten by barracuda and
other predators soon after release. And when lost, traps often continue
\u201cghost fishing,\u201d attracting and killing captured animals as
long as they stay intact. Unless new ways are developed to deal with the
 lionfish invasion through biological controls (parasites, diseases,
genetic sterilization), the only practical ways to remove lionfish from
deep habitats may be by using innovative capture devices. This subtopic
addresses the challenge of developing and testing devices that remove
invasive fish from deep water rapidly, in high numbers, and without the
drawbacks of other collection techniques. Phase I Activities and
Expected Deliverables:&amp;nbsp;Activities include: Prepare conceptual
design for device that will: (1)&amp;nbsp;selectively capture lionfish
with minimal impact to the environment while operating or if lost, and
(2)&amp;nbsp;avoid impacts to non-targetedDeliverables include:Concept

usersPhase II Activities and Expected Deliverables: Activities include:
Build prototype to test operational characteristics Conduct field tests
to evaluate function and effectiveness Construct devices using materials
 intended for actual operations Demonstrate viability of any ancillary
operations intended to complement fish removal (e.g., disposal, or
distribution as part of supply chain for restaurant use) Deliverables
include: Prototype Field test results Operational device built with
final materials Disposal or distribution plan. NOTE: Even though a
prototype may be required to be delivered for the project, it is
important to note that this prototype is still the property of the

environment.&amp;nbsp;Subtopic 8.2.3D Sensor System for Measuring Oxygen
 Demands in Natural Waters Summary: Occurrences of large volumes of
hypoxic or anoxic waters, also known as \u201cdead zones\u201d, are
widespread in the United States, including the Gulf of Mexico, the Great
 Lakes, the Chesapeake Bay, the Long Island Sound, and coastal waters
off Oregon and Washington. A capability to monitor and forecast the
locations of these dead zones is highly desired from the standpoint of
ecosystem and water quality management. Satellite optical remote sensing
 is a promising tool to build such a capability because light absorption
 and scattering by oxygen-consuming organic matter is detectable from
space. Establishing direct linkages between the optical signatures of
these organic materials and their oxygen consumption is currently
hindered by the lack of adequate and user-friendly instruments for
routine and quick response measurements of oxygen consumption in natural
 water bodies. Such instrumentation would greatly facilitate NOAA\u2019s
 development of remote-sensing algorithms for monitoring, forecasting,
and managing aquatic ecosystems and water quality. Project Goals: NOAA
is requesting proposals for a field instrument system equipped with
sensors capable of simultaneously and directly (not by proxy) measuring
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in both
 freshwater and marine environments. Once developed, data-acquisition
should be achievable in both stationary and profiling modes, and the
system should be accurate, rugged, reliable, portable, low-cost,
quick-response, anti-foulant, submersible to ~100 m, and easy to deploy
from a variety of platforms (e.g., land, zodiac, small research vessel).
 Phase I Activities and Expected Deliverables: Activities include:
Research and technology development for a proof-of-concept BOD\/COD
sensor system. Deliverables include: A detailed proof-of-concept report
describing research results and technology development completed for a
BOD\/COD sensor system, and A description of where the principal
investigator expects the project to be at the end of Phase II, including
 a description of how this sensor system will be commercialized. Phase
II Activities and Expected Deliverables: Activities include: Development
 of a prototype system; Lab calibration of the prototype system; and
Demonstration field tests of the prototype system. Build prototype to
test operational characteristics Deliverables include:A prototype system
 calibrated in the lab which demonstrates the success of the research \/
 technology development; A detailed report on the results of
demonstration field deployments in both modes (stationary and profile)
of the prototype system; and A thorough plan, including a timeline,
describing the transition of this prototype system into the commercial
marketplace NOTE: Even though a prototype may be required to be
delivered for the project, it is important to note that this prototype
is still the property of the offeror. NOAA would only do field or lab
testing on that product to see its feasibility in a production (or

Multi-Platform Sensor for Marine Debris and Object Detection and Mapping
 Summary: Detecting and mapping objects and debris in our oceans,
coastal areas and marine navigation routes has been a difficult problem.
 Advancements in sensor and measurement technologies are drastically
needed. Marine debris and pollutants pose significant navigational and
environmental threats. The tsunami on March 11, 2011 making landfall in
Japan produced 5 million tons of debris in the ocean, and it is believed
 that more than 1 million tons of debris are still floating. This debris
 significantly threatens marine navigation and coastal environments. As
the downhill flow rate of the Greenland glaciers further increases
(doubled in the last decade), a larger number of icebergs are being
calved. With the warming trend in ocean temperatures, these icebergs are
 melting at a faster rate and calving to produce smaller icebergs that
are more difficult to detect. The same is occurring in the southern
ocean. Wind and ocean currents are transporting these icebergs into
shipping routes, posing significant threat to marine navigation. With
the warming trend, sea ice is also changing affecting navigational
paths. Routine monitoring of these changes is urgently needed. Melting
sea ice also plays a role in climate change. Accurate knowledge of sea
ice extent and location is needed for climate studies and forecasting.
Accidents at sea, be it marine vessels, cargo or aircraft, require an
ability to rapidly search large regions for debris in order to focus
search &amp;amp; rescue and recovery resources. Identifying the location
 of the debris allows the search &amp;amp; rescue area to be reduced
significantly and thereby improving chances of finding survivors,
minimizing cargo loss and reducing costs in these efforts. NOAA seeks
innovative sensor and measurement technology that can be deployed from
manned and unmanned ships and aircraft, as well as satellite platforms
in the future, that can provide accurate detection and mapping of marine
 debris and objects over large swath \/ coverage areas. Project Goals:
This project seeks an innovative sensor and measurement approach for
detecting and mapping debris and objects in our oceans, coastal areas
and marine navigational routes. The sensor should be deployable from
manned and unmanned marine vessels and aircraft; provide wide swath
coverage; and the measurement technique can be applied from a spaceborne
 platform in the future. Phase I Activities and Expected Deliverables
Activities include: Define measurement and operational requirements for
applications discussed above in the project summary. These should
include specific requirements that each type of platform (e.g. marine
vessel, aircraft, manned, unmanned, etc.) will place on the final sensor
 and measurement technique. Develop and define measurement concept(s),
sensor concept and system specifications.Develop preliminary system
design to meets above requirements and specifications. Determine
measurement performance in terms of final geophysical parameters,
spatial coverage and temporal coverage. Determine feasibility and cost
to build prototype and estimate operational costs of a Phase 3 system
for each type of platform (spaceborne excluded). Identify commercial
applications \/ market spaces and potential revenue from the product
(maybe sensor itself and\/or data products it produces) developed based
on the system developed through the SBIR. Deliverables include:

Subtopic 8.2.5R Autonomous direct measure of carbonate ion in saline
waters Summary: Chemical changes in seawater result from the uptake of
carbon dioxide (CO2) either as a result of rising atmospheric CO2 levels
 (i.e. ocean acidification), or as a result of enhanced respiration
particularly within coastal waters. These changes include increasing
concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), the production of
carbonic acid (e.g. acidification), an increase in the partial pressure
of seawater CO2, and shifts in the ratio of bicarbonate to carbonate ion
 availability whereby carbonate ion concentration decline with
increasing CO2 levels. How these changes affect marine life is a
prominent issue for contemporary oceanography and marine resource
management. Geological evidence reveals dramatic changes in marine life
as a consequence of past events where similar rates of CO2 increase
occurred and experimental studies indicate that a broad range of
contemporary taxa are sensitive to such changes. Documentation of the
chemical changes accompanying ocean acidification is a key element in
acquiring the environmental intelligence needed to foster a resilient
society. Carbonate ion concentration is a particularly important
variable with regards to ocean acidification as a number of important
impacts to marine calcifiers are often attributed to its decrease.
However, rather than being directly measured, carbonate ion is generally
 calculated from two of the four major CO2 system parameters: pH, pCO2,
DIC, and total alkalinity resulting in a propagation of error associated
 with the two measured parameters as well as the dissociation constants
used to solve the carbonic acid system from them. Direct measurement
using existing ion selective electrodes (ISE) significantly lack the
sensitivity or precision needed for marine science or monitoring
applications. Spectrophotometric methods are available remain laborious
and not available at this time for autonomous applications. There is an
emergent need for an accurate direct determination of carbonate ion with
 a precision of \u00b15 \u03bcM that is suitable for autonomous
applications including sustained deployments and in experimental
research applications. Project Goals: This project will provide the
field with an autonomous direct measure of carbonate ion concentration
with suitable precision and accuracy for marine monitoring and research
applications. The new Method will be useful to a wide range of users
(e.g., marine resource managers, environmental monitoring entities,
aquaculturist, fisheries, etc.) and would prove immensely valuable in
assessing the impact of ocean acidification on the health of the marine
ecosystem. Other applications would include clinical chemistry whereby
the most important buffer of plasma is the bicarbonate\/carbonic acid
pair due to the important role CO2 plays on the regulating plasma pH.
Phase I Activities and Expected Deliverables Activities

Laser-Based Analyzer for Methane, Carbon and Hydrogen Isotopic
Measurements in the Deep Sea Summary: Development of laser-based sensors
 that are capable of measuring chemical species (gases and isotopes)
will greatly enhancing the ability to understand biogeochemical
processes in a range of ocean environments from the deep sea to coastal
environments. Laser-based platforms can provide highly sensitive and
precise measurements and be designed to target isotopic species.
Laser-based platforms are particularly well suited to gas and stable
isotope measurements but currently are large in size and have power
requirements limiting the ability to deploy them in the deep sea. The
development of smaller, more compact, and less power-hungry instruments
will allow new in situ studies of biogeochemical processes in the ocean,
 including surveys of hydrate-hosting continental shelf sediments or
hydrothermal vent settings. Other advances will come from the
utilization of different lasers, different sensing schemes, new
detectors, and targeting a variety of chemical species. Atmospheric
sensors exist that utilize laser-based spectroscopy for such gases as
methane, CO2, and N2O. Many such sensors are currently being used for
surface water analysis, but very limited work has been done to push the
technology into submersible sensors. Project Goals: New laser-based
sensors that can be deployed on a variety of platforms, such as
ROV\u2019s, AUV\u2019s and seafloor observatories are needed to
understand biogeochemical processes and the carbon cycle in the deep
sea. Technology advancements to decrease sensor size, power requirements
 and sensor accuracy are needed. Other areas of technology innovation
will come from advancing gas extraction techniques, targeting a range of
 gases, utilizing new sensing schemes, and using novel lasers and
detectors. Phase I Activities and Expected Deliverables: Activities
include Identify key challenges for sensor design Execute research and
development of sensor design including identifying target gas species,
package size and power requirements Deliverables include Proof of
concept Report showing promise for commercial application of developed
technology\/techniques Phase II Activities and Expected Deliverables:
Activities include Design and build prototypeTest prototype in ocean
environment Deliverables include Detailed report on developed sensor
technology showing sensitivity, precision, and accuracy and reliability

delivered for the project, it is important to note that this prototype

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Applications Supporting the NWS
MissionSummary: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a technology
supporting an explosive rate of private sector innovation. This project
focuses on unmet need of every branch of NOAA, but particularly the NWS,
 which will then branch outward to numerous state and local government
entities (e.g. Emergency Management, Department of Transportation, US
Forestry Service, Coast Guard etc.), and to private entities supporting
the government entities. The project, in particular, focuses on UAV
utilizations that can directly save lives, as well as indirectly save
lives through improved forecasts, warnings, and public alerts. Project
Goals: A NOAA White Paper (available upon request) has been developed
with two dozen valuable applications of small UAVs for the National
Weather Service and its partners (e.g. Emergency Management, Department
of Transportation, US Forestry Service, Coast Guard, etc.). The funded
project will utilize air worthy craft, appropriate payloads, and
approved testing facilities, to demonstrate the following
applications:Acquisition of boundary layer temperature, humidity, and
wind information for high-res models in support of more accurate
forecasts of tornadoes and severe thunderstorms, flash floods, and
winter storms.Ability to survey storm damage, provide before- and
after-storm imagery, and access imagery to wildfire burn scars. Ability
to access river level information that could support more accurate river
 flood forecasts.Ability to utilize UAVs to monitor, and potentially
alert swimmers to, the presence of deadly rip currents. Ability to
utilize UAVs to alert communities of approaching deadly weather, e.g.
flash flood, tornado, etc. (i.e. a flying siren for communities that
cannot afford ground-based siren systems).Ability to assess road
conditions during and after winter storm events. Utilization of UAVs for
 meteorological research initiatives (e.g. sensing boundaries that could
 initiate thunderstorms). River flood or storm surge inundation impacts
using LIDAR payload. Utilizing UAVs for search and rescue efforts.
Utilizing UAVs for wildfire support, both gathering video of fire area
and gathering meteorological data to support better near-term forecasts
to help wildfire incident teams. These are all critical needs that
cannot be easily addressed without UAVs and the payloads they would
carry. Phase I Activities and Expected Deliverables: Activities include:
 Develop and demonstrate a cost-feasible, air-worthy craft that could
accomplish the project requirements. "Cost-feasible" refers to a means
by which smaller potential customers could afford the technology. Ensure
 ability to transmit UAV accessed information in real time to a ground
station. Ensure ability of craft to fly in variety of conditions that
could be faced, including precipitation, moderate winds, etc. Developing

facility, at least every 100 ft up to a height of at least 3,000 ft AG
(5,000-10,000ft preferable. Illustration of cost-feasible nature of the
technology, preferably under $50,000, as well as the total cost of
ownership (i.e. required maintenance costs, insurance, expected lifetime
 for daily operation, etc.). Phase II Activities and Expected
Deliverables: Activities include: Demonstrate each of the two dozen UAV
applications given in NOAA's White Paper at a variety of test facilities
 and in different atmospheric environments. Additional applications from
 NOAA's partners (e.g. emergency management, coast guard, etc.) may be
added. Deliverables include Demonstration results for each application

AUVSI national meeting &amp;nbsp;Subtopic 8.4.2W Satellite Environment
Space Weather Products Summary: Satellite systems are susceptible to the
 low-energy and high-energy particle environment in space, which can
cause surface charging, bulk charging, and single-event upsets in
electronic devices. Currently real-time data and numerical models are
available to provide information on the conditions in space and the
likelihood that the recent conditions could be responsible for anomalous
 spacecraft effects. In addition to the particle data available from the
 current NOAA Geostationary Operational Environment Satellites (GOES),
the next generation satellite series beginning with the launch of GOES-R
 in 2016 will include a broader suite of low- and high-energy charged
particle measurements. It is desired to improve the utilization of the
real-time data and models and to develop new products and services that
address specific needs of the satellite industry. Project Goals: The
goal of this project is to develop improved products to address the
impacts of space weather on the satellite industry. This activity will:
evaluate the utility to the satellite industry of specific products,
including forecasts, real-time information, and retrospective
information, both existing and potential; utilize currently available
data to develop test products for evaluation; plan for products that
will be possible with data soon to be available on the upcoming GOES-R
mission; develop products utilizing available numerical models. Products
 may be public-facing or tailored to specific users, or some combination
 of the two. Phase I Activities and Expected Deliverables: Assess the
needs of potential customers and users of satellite-environment
products. Develop test products based on customer feedback utilizing
existing data (from NOAA and\/or other sources) and evaluate the
accuracy and consistency. Develop a product plan for data that will be
available from GOES-R. Develop test products using available numerical
models of the satellite environment. Obtain feedback on the test
products and planned products from potential customers. Deliver a report
 and documentation on test and planned products, including customer
feedback. Provide prototype code for all products. Phase II Activities
and Expected Deliverables: Develop prototypes of the products for test
and evaluationEstablish links to real-time data Develop code that could
be made operational Document code for possible transition to operations
Run the test code in real-time, and retrospectively if appropriate, and
evaluate the performance. Develop products based on customer needs and
requirements NOTE: Even though a prototype may be required to be
delivered for the project, it is important to note that this prototype
is still the property of the offeror. NOAA would only do field or lab
testing on that product to see its feasibility in a production (or
development) environment &amp;nbsp;Subtopic 8.4.3W Satellite ground
station network for real-time space weather dataSummary: The
Nation\u2019s critical infrastructure and economy are increasingly
susceptible to the impacts of space weather. Leadership at the highest
levels of government, including DHS, DoD, and the White House, are
involved in efforts to prepare and respond to severe space weather
outbreaks. Some of the most critical real-time space weather data comes
from satellites both near Earth and at various locations around the
solar system. Data from geosynchronous or geostationary satellites are
fairly easy to acquire in real-time as it requires only one downlink
site on the ground. Data from LEO and MEO satellites often have 60-90
minute latency between satellite and the operational data processing
sites. This is typically due to the lack of satellite downlink sites and
 the time between when the data is acquired by the sensors on the
satellite and when the satellite can downlink the data to a site on the
ground. Similarly, satellite out in the solar wind such as ACE or DSCOVR
 at the first Lagrange point (L1) or at other points such as the fifth
Lagrange point (L5) require a number of downlink sites around the world
in order to provide continuous real-time data links. Current satellite
downlink options are being met by a number of different solutions. Some
solutions require international partnerships. Other existing solutions
for satellites constellations such as COSMIC II are not adequate for
providing real-time data with less than 15 minute latencies.Project
Goals: The goal of this activity is to assess the needs of the
operational satellite data systems for space weather and explore options
 for optimizing down-link locations and satellite dishes to provide
continuous and near-real time access to the satellite data. Phase I of
this activity would require an assessment of current and planned
satellite systems, including LEO, MEO, L1, L5, and even polar Molniya
orbits and what the real-time satellite data downlink systems might look
 like. Phase II of this effort would involve investigation into
satellite communication and dish technologies that might provide
improved downlink capabilities and flexibilities. Phase I Activities and
 Expected Deliverables: Activities includeAssess requirements and
current capabilities of the Real-time Solar Wind Network used for
tracking the ACE and DSCOVR satellites at L1 Assess requirements for
tracking satellites at L5 Assess requirements and current capabilities
for tracking constellations of LEO satellites to provide near-continuous
 real-time data flow. Assess downlink options for other orbits such as
MEO and Molniya. Deliverables include: A report on the technical
requirements for real-time satellite data downlinks for each type of
orbit described above. This report should include an assessment of
current capabilities and areas where current solutions are not providing
 optimal data access and latencies Phase II Activities and Expected
Deliverables: Activities include: Concept implementation and product
development. Identify various solutions to providing improved data
downlink for the various satellite orbits. Explore options such as
satellite-to-satellite data relays to improve latencies. Deliverables
include: Report on suggested solutions to satellite downlink options
including ground system hardware specifications &amp;nbsp;Subtopic
8.4.4D L-Band Radio Frequency Interference Filtering Summary: The Middle
 Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Section 6401 (a), (3)
directed the Secretary of Commerce to identify 15 MHz of U.S. government
 use spectrum suitable for repurposing, i.e., sharing with commercial
wireless carriers. The Secretary of Commerce identified 1695 \u2013 1710
 MHz as the band to be designated for sharing with the wireless
carriers. In order to ensure the continued successful capture of
satellite meteorological data, while providing opportunity for the
wireless carriers to also operate in the band, NOAA is seeking
innovative approaches to potentially mitigate interference signals from
wireless user equipment (UE), such as, handheld smart phones and devices
 in close proximity to NOAA\/NWS satellite ground stations. An effective
 interference mitigation approach will ensure the uninterrupted flow of
critical meteorological data from Low Earth Orbiting (LEO)\/Polar
Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) and Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite system (GOES) satellites once spectrum sharing
begins. The wireless carriers could begin commercial use of the
frequency soon. Additionally, it is likely that in the future there will
 be more spectrum auctions, which may require additional spectrum
sharing between the government and wireless telecommunications industry.
 The Radio Frequency Interference Monitoring System (RFIMS) program was
initiated to investigate mitigate the risk associated with sharing the
frequency band. A key aspect of the project will be to investigate
opportunities to filter\/separate out interference, rather than simply
monitor it and identify it. The filtering of interference as opposed to
simply monitoring for interference provides for a significantly better
solution as it proactively negates the affects the of interference;
where simply monitoring would interaction with the wireless carriers and
 reliance on the wireless carriers to take corrective action. Project
Goals: The L-Band Radio Frequency (RF) Filtering project goals are to
significantly advance the technology of the hardware and software used
in satellite communication by developing a fully adaptive and
re-configurable architecture that is agnostic to specified waveforms and
 standards; i.e., NOAA L-Band RF Filtered ground stations will be able
to cognitively choose to operate in any frequency band with any
modulation and multiple access specification depending on the
restrictions of the environmental and operating conditions capable of
identifying and separating unwanted signals; including LTE with
Orthogonal Frequency Division multiplexing (OFDM) and unintentional
broad band radio frequency interference (RFI) in the 1695 \u2013 1710
MHz band from the operational Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)
modulated satellite downlink signals. While the interference issue
primarily affects government users (e.g. National Weather Service,
Department of Defense (DoD), and the Department of Interior (DOI)),
civilian and commercial organizations that capture these down-links and
use the data for daily and critical weather forecasting in support of a
weather ready nation could also potentially benefit from this project.
The project is intended to demonstrate a reconfigurable RF front-end
filter covering a frequency range of greater than or equal to 1695
\u2013 1710 MHz up to the entire L-Band range. This front-end will
consist of fully waveform-agile channels and analog-sensing channels
designed to detect, identify and separate waveforms over the spectral
field of regard. Depending on the design, the system could
filter\/separate signals at the RF or IF (intermediate frequency) level,
 or both. In addition to maintaining critical communication links, this
project will equip each satellite receive ground station with a compact
and powerful signal sensing and analysis platform capable of
characterizing the signal environment. This project will also enable
rapid RF front-end filter platform deployment for new waveforms and
changing operational requirements. Phase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables: Activities include: Demonstrate the feasibility of a
filter to effectively identify and separate out unwanted interference
from Long-Term Evolution (LTE) wireless carriers, in real-time, without a
 priori knowledge of the interfering signals in the 1695-1710 MHz band.
Where the interference could be 10 db below the noise floor, sources are
 very mobile and transient, as is expected in LTE operations. Also the
interference may be the result of aggregation of multiple low-power
interference sources. Produce a feasibility study, documenting the proof
 of concept design of an adaptive filter capability. Document all
analysis, laboratory test environments\/equipment configurations,
modeling and simulations utilized during the study phase. Deliverables
include: A feasibility study documenting the offerors\u2019 proof of
concept, with supporting analysis using a prescriptive model. Analysis
using mathematical (deterministic) models of the impact of the developed
 algorithms, simulations and laboratory experiments. Report showing the
promise for commercial applications. Phase II Activities and Expected
Deliverables: Activities include Simulation using statistical
(stochastic) models of the techniques and products developed in phase I.
 Development and initial testing of prototype(s). Prototype trials in
either a laboratory or field environment of the techniques and products
developed in Phase I. Deliverables include A prototype or laboratory
equipment and documented configuration with detail on how either could
be turned into a production model. Detailed report on developed
technology\/technique showing the results of simulation and prototyping
and economic feasibility under commercial conditions.NOTE: Even though a
 prototype may be required to be delivered for the project, it is
important to note that this prototype is still the property of the
offeror. NOAA would only do field or lab testing on that product to see
its feasibility in a production (or development) environment",

8.5.1TT NOy Cavity Right-Down Instrument Summary: The Patent Pending
NOAA NOy-Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer is a sensitive, compact detector
that measures total reactive nitrogen (NOy), as well as NO2, NO and O3
using cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS). This product is unique in
that the optical cage system holds four optical cavities (with
associated sample cells) and a laser together, allowing a measurement of
 all four trace gases simultaneously and with a robust calibration in a
small package. The NOAA CRDS is compact and has lower power, size,
weight, and vacuum requirements than chemiluminescence-based instruments
 while approaching equivalent sensitivity, precision and time response.
Climate science and air quality monitoring provide ongoing applications
for instrumentation to accurately measure atmospheric trace gases. The
precision and accuracy of this instrument make it a versatile
alternative to standard chemiluminescence-based NOy instruments
currently on the market. The markets for scientific instruments in the
U.S. and abroad are well-established and supported by a number of known
scientific instrument manufacturers, including at least three domestic
and three international commercial manufacturers of a cavity ring down
NO2 instruments. Given the compact and efficient performance and other
unique features of this instrument for measuring ambient air across a
range of environments and measurement platforms, it is an excellent
licensing opportunity for the scientific instrument manufacturing
sector.Project Goals: The NOAA NOy CRDS was developed for the Earth
System Research Laboratory in Boulder, CO, in order to support the
lab\u2019s research activities. There is one prototype in existence,
which is in regular use by the lab. The goal of NOAA\u2019s Technology
Transfer program is to encourage the broader use of NOAA\u2019s patented

 8.5.2TT Smart Module for Communications Processing and Interface
Summary: Engineers at NOAA\u2019s National Data Buoy Center have
developed a patent-pending data collection and reporting system, the
Smart Module for Communications Processing and Interface, for use on
data buoys or similar ocean- or land-based platforms where environmental
 data are being collected. The benefit of the Smart Module design is
that it may be readily retrofitted to a data buoy, weather station, or
other similar applications, in order to add additional data acquisition
capabilities or features, without disturbing existing communications and
 data logging equipment at the location. This saves both time and money
for testing and certifying new equipment at existing data gathering
sites, some of which may be quite remote and difficult to access. By
eliminating the risk of compromising an entire system by adding new
components, the Smart Module makes adding new capabilities to existing
platforms relatively simple and extremely cost effective. Project Goals:
 The Smart Module was developed for the National Buoy Data Center (NDBC)
 in Stennis, MS, in order to support NOAA\u2019s operational buoy
systems around the world. The NDBC manufactures a small number of these
modules in house for its own use. The goal of NOAA\u2019s Technology
Transfer program is to encourage the broader use of NOAA\u2019s patented
 or patent-pending technologies in commercial markets and\/or to
encourage the development of new uses for our technologies. The project

 &amp;nbsp;Subtopic 8.5.3TT System for Monitoring, Determining, and
Reporting Directional Spectra of Ocean Surface Waves in Near Realtime
from a Moored Buoy Summary: NOAA and a number of other scientific and
academic institutions have built and maintained an extensive national
network of buoys with the purpose of providing more accurate weather and
 water forecasts to the public. As a part of this network, NOAA
engineers have developed a System for Monitoring, Determining and
Reporting Directional Spectra of Ocean Surface Waves from a Moored Buoy,
 which was awarded a US patent in 2009. While many existing weather data
 buoys adequately measure wave height, oftentimes other useful wave
data, such as direction, are not captured. This could be important, for
example, if wave direction is opposite tidal direction, causing
conditions near shore where wave heights may increase. In addition, wave
 direction may differ from wind direction, and thus a report of wind
direction may not always be indicative of wave direction. Wave direction
 in particular is useful for mariners (both commercial and recreational)
 when plotting a course to avoid broaching waves. Similarly, scientists,
 decision makers, and the general public find wave direction data useful
 in studying shore erosion, environmental impacts of waves, and for
calculating ideal surf times and locations. Furthermore, other wave data
 (e.g. - slope) may be useful to oceanographers and engineers, as well
as mariners. While NOAA has integrated this technology into its buoy
network, there is still great potential for a commercial venture to use
the technology to new networks and applications using this technology to
 serve highly personalized data to specific regions or industries (e.g.,
 energy, tourism, etc.). Project Goals: The technology was developed for
 the National Buoy Data Center (NDBC) in Stennis, MS, in order to
support NOAA\u2019s operational buoy systems around the world. The goal
of NOAA\u2019s Technology Transfer program is to encourage the broader
use of NOAA\u2019s patented or patent-pending technologies in commercial
 markets and\/or to encourage the development of new uses for our

properties",
        "description": "NOAA\u2019s goals of (1) resilient coastal
communities and economies, (2) healthy oceans, (3) a weather-ready
nation, and (4) climate adaptation and mitigation, all hinge upon the
depth of intelligence gathered about the dynamic ocean environment. Key
oceanographic information drives climate and weather models, provides
bench marks for how the ocean is changing, and is also important for
other forms of coastal intelligence such as hydrography. A time varying
and fully three dimension understanding of the subsurface ocean
temperature and salinity is fundamental to improving our understanding
of this important boundary condition, yet many measurements rely on
inefficient in situ instrumentation beyond the top few meters of the
ocean. Fine-scale ship based measurements are dependent on observations
using equipment to sample vertically through the water column at a fixed
 location, or on hull-mounted and towed-sensor equipment for
measurements along transects at a quasi-fixed depth. Such
instrumentation is expensive in terms of either the time spent for the
deployment and recovery or in terms of expendable probes that are simply
 dropped not recovered. Ship-based remote sensing to measure efficiently
 an extended region of the sub-surface oceanographic profiles would
offer a huge improvement. There are techniques that may be leveraged to
provide remotely-sensed oceanographic profiles in real time. For
example, temperature, salinity, and density effects have been shown to
cause measureable and statistically deterministic shifts in the
scattered spectrum from lidar. Using the highly directional and stable
frequency characteristics of lasers, Raman and Brillouin scattering may
be leveraged to characterize the temperature, salinity, or overall sound
 speed profile of the water column. While these phenomena have been
demonstrated for decades, no commercial instrumentation has been built
to provide reliable measurements to the shipboard oceanographic
community. \n&amp;nbsp;",

support research and development of devices, software, or technology
that will optimize data collection for NIDDK clinical
studies.\n\nBackground:  \n\nNIDDK has ongoing clinical studies (e.g.,
Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort or CRIC) and several consortium
studies planned for 2013-2018:\n\nRFA-DK-12-010
(http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/rfa-files\/RFA-DK-12-010.html):
 Novel Therapies and Approaches to Reduce Morbidity and Mortality of
Hemodialysis Patients.  This FOA will establish a multi-center
consortium to carry out pilot and feasibility studies to optimize
critical elements of the study design of a subsequent full-scale
randomized controlled clinical trial of novel therapies, including
procedural or technical changes, psychosocial interventions and
anti-inflammatory treatment(s) for end-stage renal disease patients
undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD).  The study will include data
assessing drug dosing, safety and adverse events, potential biomarkers
and surrogate endpoints, such as patient reported outcomes (PROs).
\n\nRFA-DK-12-014
(http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/rfa-files\/RFA-DK-12-014.html):
 Advancing Clinical Research in Primary Glomerular Disease.  This FOA
will establish a multi-center consortium to recruit a population who are
 diagnosed with one of four major glomerular diseases.  Because of the
slow progression of these diseases, the study will be a longitudinal
observation with collection of phenotypic, genetic, biochemical, and
tissue data.  It is anticipated that ancillary studies to this
consortium will develop and qualify biomarkers and surrogate outcomes
(e.g., PROs) that will be used in future therapeutic trials for these
diseases.\n\nRFA-DK-12-016
(http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/rfa-files\/RFA-DK-12-016.html):
 Pilot Studies of Candidate Therapies for Chronic Kidney Disease.  The
purpose of this FOA is to form a multi-center, collaborative study group
 that will carry out pilot studies that optimize critical elements of
the study design of subsequent randomized trial(s) of new treatment(s)
for CKD.  Renal and non-renal outcomes including measures of CKD
progression will be determined during this study, including alternative
endpoint markers such as biochemical biomarkers or PROs.

 Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN)
(U01). This FOA supports the development of a cooperative research
network (Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network,
or LURN) to develop and qualify symptom-based instruments (patient
reported outcome (PRO) measures) to measure early, late, transient, and
persistent symptoms both in males and females, and to better define the
phenotypes of men and women with symptoms of lower urinary tract
dysfunction (LUTD).\n\nRFA-DK-12-017
(http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/rfa-files\/RFA-DK-12-017.html):
 Expansion of Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research
Network (LURN). The aim of this FOA is to expand on the LURN to
validate\/qualify the developed Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measures,
 recruit study participants, and conduct extensive characterization
(phenotyping) of them. The phenotyping efforts will use a
multi-disciplinary, integrated approach in order to expand our
understanding of the pathophysiological causes of symptoms of LUTD; and
identify methods and collect data and\/or samples to find predictors
and\/or biomarkers of symptom initiation, flare, and progression that
may inform strategies to prevent and\/or manage disease. \n\nStudies
such as those listed above and those that will follow these initiatives
in the future have traditionally relied on research personnel to collect
 data either in a face-to-face visit or via a telephone interview.
These same research personnel or others then transcribe the raw data
into a computerized database that is often verified in quality control
checks.  The cost of these personnel and infrastructure is high, and the
 travel\/telephone time often becomes burdensome for the participants,
resulting in their early dropout from studies of duration of more that
12-24 months.  With the movement toward large cohorts in realistic
practice settings, such as the recently awarded NIH Health Care Systems
Research Collaboratory, there is a growing need to collect data without
the use of costly research personnel.  Symptoms (e.g., PROs), habits
(e.g., smoking), dietary intake, physical activity or real-life events
(e.g., syncope or myocardial infarction) as part of the participants
phenotype often must rely on participant recall well after the event.
Adherence to a particular therapy is another issue in therapeutic trials
 that is often difficult to ascertain.  Health care usage and
hospitalizations are often study outcomes, but capturing all of these
may be problematic.  Biochemical data that relies on measurement in the
blood or urine typically requires the participant to travel to a center
or health care facility for collection and transport of the specimen to a
 central laboratory.  This is an additional burden on the participant
and on study staff.\n\nClinical Research Importance:  \n\nOptimization
of data collection with new technology has the potential to improve:
real-time observations (e.g., biomarkers, diet, physical activity, vital
 signs, psychological parameters, environmental factors), reporting of
patient outcomes (PROs), recording of interventions (e.g., pill intake),
 and adherence (e.g., diet, medicine, physical activity).  These devices
 or techniques also have the potential to improve participant retention
and to decrease research costs per participant.\n\nSuccessful
Applications will have addressed all of the following:  \n\n1.
Specification of the NIDDK trial application(s) and rationale for
proposed use of technology in the trial.  The technology can take the
form of hardware (e.g., devices that measure and\/or transmit data),
software (e.g., an application for a smartphone), a sensor that measures
 study variables and can be linked to another device that transmits
data, or any other item that will enhance the collection of the desired
data.\n\n2. Detailed description of the proposed technology will include
 but not be limited to:\n\nIf an electronic device: size, power
requirements, weight \nIf software: computer language, capability to
interface with devices and other software, size of files, user interface
 \nIf a sensor or measurement: interface with human body, interface with
 recording device, electronic characteristics (e.g., voltage, milliamps,
 power requirements) \n3. Details of how the new technology will
optimize the clinical trial.  This includes but is not limited to the
following:\n\nCollection of data \nTransmission of data to database
\nQuality of data \nTimeliness of data \nParticipant retention
\nParticipant adherence to the trial procedures \nResearch staff
required for data collection and compilation \nCost vs Benefit \n4. For
applications to a urological trial:  details of how the new technology
will measure pressure within the kidney, bladder, urethra or other
points relevant to function, urine flow, rectal or urethral sphincter
activity.\n\n5. Measurements of body fluids for specific trials should
be discussed, and the proposed theoryand approach to the determination
of the biomarker(s) should be detailed and include the following, as
indicated by the study design:\n\nUrine (e.g., inflammatory, proteomic,
metabolomic studies demonstrating specific disease markers) \nStool
(e.g., individual microbiome, metabolomic studies) \nBlood (e.g., GFR
marker(s), inflammatory markers, proteomic, metabolomic studies
demonstrating specific acute and chronic disease markers) \nSweat (e.g.,
 volume status, hydration indicators) \nSaliva (e.g., salt
concentrations, glucose concentrations, drug concentrations, enzymes)
\nGoals for specificity, accuracy, detection limits of each proposed
test \nPreliminary pre-clinical data for any of the above. \n6. For all
clinical applications that interface with the body, notification of and
necessary clearance(s) by the FDA should be discussed and\/or
documented.     \n",

        "description": "Background:  \n\nStudies in animals have
demonstrated that sterile polymer materials placed intraperitoneally
will demonstrate adherent inflammatory cells in a matter of hours and
will cause alterations in the surrounding tissue within 24 hours.  The
initial steps in the reaction involve the irreversible deposition of
fibrinogen and other plasma proteins on the polymer surface, followed by
 the binding of macrophages and other inflammatory cells to epitopes of
the protein.  In rodents, the local inflammation from intraperitoneal
catheters progresses for 1-4 weeks and then gradually subsides, but
there is evidence of systemic inflammatory changes in other tissues
distant from the foreign body site.  Catheter materials placed within
blood vessels or within the bladder will likewise incite specific
reactions that may cause subsequent dysfunction locally and alterations
in distant systems of the body.   In addition to inflammatory cells,
bacteria form a biofilm on polymer surfaces that is often impenetrable
to antibiotic medications and may be the cause of subsequent
bacteremia.\n\nClinical Importance:  \n\nPolymer materials are used
acutely and chronically in millions of patients each day in healthcare
facilities across the U.S.  While medical grade silicone is typically
less immunogenic than previously used materials (e.g,, polyurethane or
polyethylene), there is still a significant foreign body reaction that
may directly impact the clinical health of the patient as well as
promote the formation of bacterial adherence,  biofilm formation, and
subsequent infectious complications.\n\nApplications should address all
of the following research and development issues:  \n\n1. Development of
 catheter biomaterial(s) and\/or biomaterial surface coatings that
decrease protein (e.g., fibrinogen and other circulating proteins that
bind biopolymers and cells) adsorption and absorption (often termed
biofouling) by 99% or more when compared to medical silicone and\/or
other materials in use today.  Testing should include the use of
radiolabeled proteins, spectroscopic techniques, electron microscopy, or
 other applicable measurements to determine the surface area covered by
the protein(s). \n\n2. Development of catheter biomaterial(s) and\/or
surface coatings that decrease inflammatory, bacterial and fungal cell
adherence by 99% or more when compared to medical silicone and\/or other
 materials in use today.  It is anticipated that standard in vitro
procedures will be followed, as described in the US Pharmacopeia, in
standards published by the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM), the British Standards Institute, and the International Standards
 Organization (ISO).  Close collaboration with the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) is expected when preparing to bring the biomaterial
 to market, and documentation verifying communication with the
appropriate divisions of FDA should be included in the application.
These experiments should include:\n\nTesting with a variety of
inflammatory cells: macrophages, T-lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear cells,
 and fibroblasts (e.g., L-929 fibroblast cell line) \nTesting with a
variety of bacteria including but not limited to: Staphylococcus
epidermidis (e.g., RP62A) and Escherichia Coli. \nTesting with a variety
 of fungal organisms including but not limited to Candida Albicans
\nQuantitative measurement of cell adherence by appropriate techniques
(e.g., electron microscopy or elution with ultrasound followed by
counting\/fluorescence detection) \n3. The following components should
be specified or determined in preparation for in vivo
assessments:\n\nMaterial(s) of manufacture \nIntended additives,
coatings, process contaminants, residues \nLeachable substances
\nDegradation products \nOther components and their interaction with the
 final product \n4. In vivo testing of acute (1-7 days) placement of
catheter biomaterial(s) in appropriate animal model(s) for local and
systemic inflammation and infection in one or all three regions of the
body:  intravenous, intraperitoneal, or intravesical.  Experimental
biomaterials should be compared to controls with medical silicone
catheters and\/or other materials in use today in accordance with
applicable FDA guidelines including the FDA Biological Response Test,
ISO 10993-1:2009, and the draft guidance on Premarket Notification
[510(k)] Submissions for Medical Devices that include Antimicrobial
Agents.  This should include the following at each time
interval:\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis of the tissue surrounding the
catheter to include but not be limited to: TNF\u03b1, IL-1, TGF\u03b2,
VEGF, FGF, \u03b1SMA.  In the bladder, this would entail the bladder
tissue and the urethra.  In a vein, this would mean the vein plus the
tissue within a minimum of 1000 microns of the vein.  In the peritoneal
cavity, this would be the following tissues: abdominal wall, liver,
small and large intestines, and omentum. \nIn situ examination with
electronmicroscopy of any cell coating\/biofilm on the catheter and
further immunocytochemical analysis of any cell coating\/biofilm (after
separation from catheter with ultrasound or another appropriate
technique) to determine the cellular makeup of the layer. \n5. In vivo
testing of chronic (&gt; 7 - 30 days) placement of catheter
biomaterial(s) in appropriate animal model(s) for local and systemic
inflammation and infection in three regions of the body:  intravenous,
intraperitoneal, and intravesical.  Biomaterials should be compared to
controls with medical silicone catheters and\/or other materials in use
today in accordance with applicable FDA guidelines including the FDA
Biological Response Test, ISO 10993-1, and the draft guidance on
Premarket Notification [510(k)] Submissions for Medical Devices that
include Antimicrobial Agents.  This should include the following at each
 time interval:\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis of the tissue
surrounding the catheter to include but not be limited to; TNF\u03b1,
IL-1, TGF\u03b2, VEGF, FGF, \u03b1SMA.  In the bladder, this would
entail the bladder tissue and the urethra.  In a vein, this would mean
the vein plus the tissue within 200 microns of the vein.  In the
peritoneal cavity, this would be the following tissues: abdominal wall,
liver, small and large intestines, and omentum. \nIn situ examination
with electron microscopy of any cell coating\/biofilm on the catheter
and further immunocytochemical analysis of any cell coating\/biofilm
(after separation from catheter with ultrasound or another appropriate
technique) to determine the cellular makeup of the layer.
\nImmunohistochemical examination and RNA-expression of inflammatory
markers in tissues that are not directly in contact with the catheter
material.  These sites might include heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and
brain.  The panel of markers should include a broad array of cytokines
and chemokines that may indicate systemic inflammation. ",

        "description": "\n\tPurpose\n\n\tThe NIH Common Fund is a
framework to enhance cooperative activities among the NIH Office of the
Director and all the NIH Institutes and Centers (for further
information, see http:\/\/commonfund.nih.gov). This Funding Opportunity
Announcement (FOA) is released in affiliation with the NIH Common Fund,
however, the participating Institutes and Centers (ICs) are
participating independently and funding decisions will be made within
each participating IC, not by the NIH Common Fund.&amp;nbsp; As a
result, relevance to the mission of the participating ICs is important
and will impact funding decisions.\n\n\tThis FOA encourages Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant applications from small
business concerns (SBCs) that focus on the development of tools or
techniques, that have commercial potential. Although applications will
not be restricted to a particular type of technology, NIH is especially
interested in applications to develop next-generation tools that
distinguish heterogeneous states among cells in situ. Applications
should define the current state of technology as a benchmark against
which the new tool(s) will be measured and should propose
proof-of-concept testing of the tool(s) in a complex biological tissue
or living organism. The new tools to be developed in the application
should provide substantially increased sensitivity, selectivity,
spatiotemporal resolution, scalability or non-destructive analysis of
multiple global or functional measures of single cells. These novel
technologies will aid in obtaining a fine-grained, integrative and
dynamic view of heterogeneous cellular states\/classes and will provide
innovative platforms to transform research into the cellular basis of
diseases.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tThis initiative is affiliated with the
Single Cell Analysis Program (SCAP) through the NIH Common Fund (See
http:\/\/commonfund.nih.gov\/singlecell\/), which supports cross-cutting
 programs that are expected to have exceptionally high
impact.\n\n\tSingle cell analysis has recently emerged as an important
field of research because technologies have improved in sensitivity and
throughput sufficiently to begin measuring and understanding
heterogeneity in complex biological systems and correlating it with
changes in biological function and disease processes. By profiling
individual cells, it is possible to resolve rare cells, transient cell
states, and understand the influence of organization and environment on
such cells and states, which cannot be described by ensemble
measurements. The long-term goal of the SCAP is to accelerate the move
towards personalizing health to the cellular level by understanding the
link between cell heterogeneity, tissue function and emergence of
disease through the discovery, development and translation of innovative
 approaches which will dramatically change the way cells are
characterized.\n\n\tThe SCAP focuses on supporting work which will
systematically measure, analyze and model cell-to-cell variation, and
identify crucial differences and rare biological states, which may have
important functional consequences. To robustly and systematically
describe cell level heterogeneity, projects are expected to take a
multiplexed approach with minimal perturbation, which can be applied
reproducibly to any complex tissue. Technologies and methods must also
be capable of capturing spatiotemporal information to understand the
organization, evolution and response of cell states as part of a
functional population. In addition, the SCAP emphasizes the application
of these technologies to in situ populations of cells from multicellular
 organisms to link cell state measurements with complex, functional
tissues which can inform our understanding of disease
processes.&amp;nbsp; Here, NIH seeks input from the small business
community to provide highly innovative tools that will assist with these
 goals.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Commercialization of these technologies will
 make them broadly available to the scientific community and accelerate
progress in this important emerging field of single call
analysis.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tObjectives\n\n\tThis FOA encourages
applications to develop next-generation, innovative technologies to
better define cell heterogeneity in situ. These techniques should
provide new analytical measures and manipulations of cellular contents,
structure and activity significantly beyond those currently available at
 the single cell level. Of particular interest are first-in-class
and\/or cross-cutting techniques. The goal of this FOA is to accelerate
development of promising concepts by focusing on overcoming technical
challenges, building prototype systems and testing performance on a
population of cells in situ (e.g., explant, whole organism), and further
 advancing the development of these technologies toward
commercialization. This FOA seeks to support innovative projects that
will result in robust tools and approaches widely adoptable and usable
by the research community through the marketplace. Toward this end,
applications that draw upon diverse expertise from both within and
outside (e.g., engineering, physics, chemistry) of biology are of
particular interest. To the extent that it is useful in combining
different types of expertise, applications with multiple principal
investigators are encouraged (See
http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/multi_PI\/).\n\n\tApplications can
propose high-risk\/high-impact technologies; examples can include, but
are not limited to:\n\n\t\n\t\tDevices to perform novel global (i.e.,
&amp;quot;-omic&amp;quot;) and\/or functional analyses of a wide variety
 of cell types in situ without destruction or prior perturbation of
cells.\n\t\n\t\tCombinations of tools for multiplex analysis and\/or
manipulation of single cells in situ to maximize data content over many
parameters (e.g., gene expression, electrochemical dynamics, signal
secretion\/reception\/transduction, cell adhesive properties,
cytoarchitectonic or migratory changes).\n\t\n\t\tTools that provide
significant advances in sensitivity, selectivity or spatiotemporal
resolution of molecules\/structures\/activities within single cells and
between ostensibly similar cells in situ.\n\t\n\t\tAutomated and
scalable assays for high-throughput analysis of single cells in situ,
including scalability of measured parameters in parallel, cell numbers
and\/or speed of processing.\n\t\n\t\tSystems-level single cell dataset
analysis or modeling, including computational approaches, in the context
 of tissues or whole organisms.\n\n\n\tResearch designs should focus on
tool development, but tools should be designed within the context of the
 types of studies to ultimately be performed in heterogeneous biological
 systems, such as:\n\n\t\n\t\tIdentification of spatiotemporal
transitions in cellular states (e.g., progenitor lineage determination,
cellular aging)\n\t\n\t\tDetection of rare cells in a population (e.g.,
stem cells, tumor-initiating or metastatic cells, drug resistant
cells)\n\t\n\t\tElucidation of the molecular signatures or functional
consequences of stochastic variation in cellular states (e.g., genomic
stability, clonal selection and evolution, asymmetric division, cell
specification)\n\t\n\t\tCharacterization of heterogeneous cell responses
 to environmental changes (e.g., homeostatic perturbation, modulation of
 niche\/microenvironment, morphogens or cell-to-cell signaling,
toxicological exposure, experience-dependent plasticity, host cell
responses to infectious, immunological or allergic
challenges).\n\n\n\tAny proposed biological assay(s) should be chosen
strictly for utility (rather than biological novelty) in
proof-of-concept testing of the innovative technique.\n\n\tAll
applications must explicitly address considerations detailed in Section
IV.2 - Application and Submission Information.\n\n\tIt is important to
emphasize that the topics listed above are only meant to be
illustrative, and not meant to be a comprehensive list of appropriate
topics, nor exclusive of other appropriate topics. Applications may
propose projects that are highly innovative or that are enhancements of
current approaches. In either case, studies must significantly advance
the current state of the art of single cell analysis and have commercial
 potential.&amp;nbsp; Submitted applications must be aligned with the
research priorities of at least one of the participating ICs. Potential
applicants are strongly encouraged to contact Scientific\/Research
Contact(s) before submitting an application.&amp;nbsp;\n",

materials that are central to both understanding basic biological
processes and for developing applications directly related to improving
human health. DCM\/ORIP-funded Resources aid these efforts by
developing, characterizing, preserving and distributing high quality
animals and biological materials that are used by researchers in all
disciplines of biomedical research. Animal Resources require many
aspects of infrastructure to serve this function. For example, optimal
husbandry, including caging and other equipment, is required to maintain
 animals as healthy stocks that can be distributed to researchers.
Animals within Resources are characterized in regard to genetic,
phenotypic and health-related characteristics. The health status of
animals can be threatened by opportunistic and emerging pathogens
associated with maintenance and reproduction of living stocks. Animals
are often preserved, either as living stocks within breeding colonies,
or as cryopreserved germ plasm. Therefore, animal models are under
continuous development and improvement to meet emerging challenges and
scientific needs. All of these functions within animal based Resources
can benefit greatly from commercial availability of key components, such
 as hardware (e.g., equipment, instruments, devices), software (e.g.,
computational models, informatics tools, data analytic methods and
resources, data repositories) and wetware (e.g., cell-free assays,
bioactive agents, imaging probes). Companies can help develop innovative
 approaches to modifying models to meet new biomedical challenges and

        "topic_name": "Technological Enhancements to Improve and Expand
Casual Carpooling Systems",
        "description": "Traditional carpooling declined in the United
States from a 20% mode share in 1980 to 13% in 1990, and then to 10% in
2004, after which it has remained stable at this low level. A variation
on the traditional carpool, casual carpooling, occurs in three U.S.
metropolitan areas (Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and Houston) and
may be an important strategy to help reverse this downward trend. While
both casual carpooling and traditional carpooling entail sharing rides,
casual carpooling enables participants to ride with different people for
 each trip with no ongoing commitments, and rideshare arrangements can
be made instantaneously. Casual carpooling matches drivers and riders
based on the three most basic variables of mobility: origin,
destination, and time of departure. Drivers and riders meet at
pre-arranged locations, such as park-and-ride lots near the entrance to
high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, create carpools on the fly based on
shared destinations, and then have no continuing obligations once the
trip has ended. Casual carpooling provides the same benefits as
traditional carpooling without a number of its most commonly cited
limitations or drawbacks, such as related to scheduling and forging
commitments.While, as noted above, casual carpooling is clearly
advantageous to its users and to transportation system efficiency
overall, its benefits are limited because in most U.S. metropolitan
areas and in most travel corridors, the conditions for successful casual
 carpooling do not exist. The necessary conditions include: HOV lanes
that offer substantial time savings and require at least three people
per vehicle (providing \u201csafety in numbers\u201d that would not
exist if only two strangers are paired in a car); sufficient parking at
the morning departure location; and back-up transit service for riders
if a casual carpooling ride does not materialize. The absence of even
one of these conditions precludes casual carpooling from getting
started.At the end of 2010, FHWA conducted a scan tour of the three
metropolitan areas with existing casual carpooling systems in the U.S.
(see:
http:\/\/www.fhwa.dot.gov\/advancedresearch\/pubs\/12053\/12053.pdf).
Follow-up focus groups were conducted in each city in mid-2012 (see:
http:\/\/www.fhwa.dot.gov\/advancedresearch\/pubs\/13053\/13053.pdf).
While a clear finding of the tour and focus groups was that casual
carpoolers give their systems high grades and are skeptical of proposed
major changes, many nevertheless expressed receptivity to targeted
system enhancements that address specific limitations of the existing
systems. Because the substantial social and practical barriers to casual
 carpooling have been overcome in the three metropolitan areas that were
 visited on the scan tour, and such barriers may not easily be overcome
in metropolitan areas where casual carpooling does not yet exist, this
topic is targeted to support research focused on any of the three U.S.
metropolitan areas that have casual carpooling, but in a corridor or at a
 specific location that have a majority\u2014but not all\u2014of the
preexisting conditions shown to enable casual carpooling (and thus where
 casual carpooling isn\u2019t working well or at all). Applicants need
to describe one or more barriers in a specific corridor or at a specific
 location in one of the three metropolitan areas that is either limiting
 the amount of casual carpooling occurring or is responsible for casual
carpooling not occurring at all in the named corridor or location, and
then describe the approach(es) that will be taken, including the
institutional support to be solicited or offered, if any, to overcome
the barrier(s).Research published summarizing lessons learned from
FHWA\u2019s scan tour
(http:\/\/www.fhwa.dot.gov\/advancedresearch\/pubs\/12053\/12053.pdf)
identified these possible system enhancements that could address
barriers to casual carpooling:Early-arriving park-and-ride passengers
may be incentivized to park further from carpool pick-up points, thereby
 freeing up closer-in parking for other riders who arrive later.Some
passengers would be willing to leave their cars at home
entirely\u2014eliminating the high emissions associated with cold-starts
 (prior to the catalytic converter warming), the need for parking, and a
 household requirement for an extra vehicle\u2014in exchange for a
close-to-home pick-up (perhaps taking transit back home or getting
picked up by a family member at a nearby park-and-ride lot in the
evening).In Houston where casual carpooling works well for the morning
commute to get into the city, but not in the reverse direction, and in
Washington, D.C., and San Francisco where getting an afternoon lift back
 to some morning pick-up points is challenging, passengers would be
willing to pay drivers for a reliable return trip, so long as the price
is low enough to seem like a bargain as compared to other options.For
locations with casual carpooling participation levels that are a bit shy
 of what is needed for a reliable return trip, an online system
enhancement could be created, where drivers and passengers can
efficiently arrange matches electronically, in or close to realtime,
using incentives to get this started.Some drivers would agree to delay
their return trips to near the time that the HOV restrictions are ending
 (and, hence, when riders are most in jeopardy of being stranded) in
exchange for incentives.At pick-up points where riders typically need to
 wait for drivers, but not vice versa, some drivers would be willing to
take more passengers than needed to meet minimum HOV requirements in
exchange for small incentives.By enhancing security, new casual
carpooling could be successfully launched to serve congested HOV-2
facilities, such as: through an app that requires drivers and passengers
 to verify their identities and records shared trips that take place;
through an alternative system where drivers and passengers undergo
background checks (or have their employers confirm where they work) and
carry proof that they underwent such checks, or; through the use of
webcams at pick-up point where video recordings of license plate numbers
 and driver and rider faces are made (but kept for only a short period
of time, such as for one week unless a safety\/security issue has been
reported).Passengers and riders would be willing to pay, or redeem
credits earned through system supporting activities, to occasionally
bypass a queue, at times when the passenger or vehicle lines are long
and the participant is particularly time pressed, and where the driver
and rider meet very nearby to (e.g., 100 yards away from), but not at,
the queue (to avoid conflicts with other casual carpoolers).This list
represents only a subset of a vast array of potential applications that
could be pursued to advance the general objective of applying effective
strategies to create new casual carpooling options and grow related
systems so that in the not-too-distant future they could cause a
meaningful impact on travel and reduce congestion.SBIR welcomes creative
 approaches to addressing the general objective noted in this topic and
specific related challenges identified in research or by the applicant.
(In the case of the latter, the applicant should specify the challenges
being addressed and offer some evidence of their significance prior to
presenting proposed solutions.)Regardless of the challenges that the
applicant chooses to address and the specific approaches selected to
address them, it should be a design goal of any new system to inculcate a
 culture whereby drivers, especially, check for incentives daily to

should explain why what they are proposing is likely to succeed,
specifically discussing the elements of successful casual carpooling
systems that inform their research. Applicants, or applicant teams, are
being sought with both high levels of technical expertise and a
demonstration of a deep appreciation for the practical and social
factors that are important to casual carpooling participants or
prospective participants. Applicants must demonstrate that, to the
extent that the development of new prototype technologies is proposed,

and Infrastructure",
        "description": "The connected vehicles program is a multimodal
U.S. DOT initiative that applies the potentially transformative
capabilities of wireless technology to make surface transportation
safer, smarter, and greener. One of the emerging technologies for
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-tovehicle (V2V)
communication is Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC). DSRC can
support communication between bicyclists and other vehicles on the road,
 as well as roadside infrastructure such as traffic signals.
Applications based on DSRC can provide safety information such as
collision avoidance warnings to motorists and bicyclists, and can
cooperate with DSRC-equipped traffic signals to provide improved bicycle
 detection as well as to convey information to bicyclists about signal
phase changes.This research is expected to develop communication from
bicyclists to other vehicles and infrastructure using DSRC
communications. The contractor shall explore the use of bicycle sensor
technologies such as, but not limited to, ANT+, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi in
order to collect data from the bicycle (such as speed and GPS
information) to share via DSRC.The first objective is to develop a
device that can be mounted to a bicycle, can collect bicycle sensor
data, and broadcast a Basic Safety Message for Bicycles (BSM-B) through
DSRC, and that can operate efficiently from a suitable power source
(battery, dynamo, etc.). The second objective is to develop an
application that can be downloaded to various types of generally used
smart phones which will interface with the device. The smart phone
should be used to alert the bicyclist on the display and with auditory
or haptic warning information. Vehicles with DSRC will be able to
receive alerts of bicyclists present on the road. This will improve the
safety of bicyclist and enable mobility improvements in urban areas as
bicycling continues to increase.Phase I funding will aim to develop the
concept of operations, a prototype to test the DSRC communication, and a
 preliminary application.Phase II funding will aim to fully develop the
DSRC device and application(s) for multiple platforms. These
applications must be user friendly and provide displays of useful
information to the bicyclist. Phase 2 should also include field testing
and evaluation of the DSRC device, and deployment on a fleet of bicycles
 in an urban environment (e.g. bike share). Application(s) are expected
to be immediately marketable upon completion of Phase
II.&amp;nbsp;Expected Phase I OutcomesOutcomes expected from the Phase I
 include a detailed concept and technical approach that demonstrate the
viability of creating a prototype that satisfies the application
described above.&amp;nbsp;Expected Phase II OutcomesPhase II efforts
include fully developing and demonstrating a working product that
provides useful BSM-B information to vehicles and infrastructure.",

        "topic_name": "Pedestrian and Cyclist Detection Devices for
Transit Buses",
        "description": "Data are limited about the full extent of
bicycle and pedestrian use, but the evidence indicates that the use of
these modes is on the rise. Data from the National Household Travel
Survey (NHTS) from 2001 and 2009, a period during which bicyclist and
pedestrian fatalities was decreasing, identified a slight increase in
walking, and almost no change in the number of people bicycling.
Although NHTS data are not available for the period in which fatalities
have increased, other sources indicate walking and biking use have been
on the rise in these years.Pedestrians represent a considerable portion
of traffic-related (cars, trucks and transit) injuries and deaths on our
 nation\u2019s highways. In 2008, 4,378 pedestrians were killed and
69,000 were injured in traffic crashes in the United States; this
represents 12% and 3%, respectively, of all the traffic fatalities and
injuries. The majority of these fatalities occurred in urban areas (72%)
 where pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicular traffic, including transit
buses, tend to co-mingle. Although, the pedestrian injuries and
fatalities are few in number relative to other collision types, bus
collisions involving pedestrians and cyclists usually carry very high
cost (injury claims), attract negative media attention, and have the
potential to create a negative public perception of transit safety.The
Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Report 125: Guidebook for
Mitigating Fixed-Route Bus-and-Pedestrian Collisions
(http:\/\/www.tcrponline.org\/PDFDocuments\/TCRP_RPT_125.pdf) indicated
that of all the collision types involving buses and pedestrians, turns
at intersections was the problem most frequently reported by transit
agencies. Of the incident reports reviewed, data show that 60% occurred
while buses were turning (left-turn collisions were more common than
right-turn collisions: 69% involved a left turn, while 31% involved a
right turn). The other two common collision types were buses pulling
into bus stops (15%) and buses pulling away from stops (10%).In recent
years, sensors have been developed to detect the presence of pedestrians
 and presence of bicycles in the path of a transit vehicle. With the
development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications,
automated pedestrian detectors are beginning to complement the existing
detectors. These applications optimize intersection operations and
improve safety by reducing the conflicts between vehicles and
pedestrians. However, there is limited understanding of the most
effective technologies for automated detection, partly because of the
great variety of technologies that are available, such as infrared,
radar, microwave, heat sensors, pressure mats, and computer-assisted
video. There are significant concerns about the reliability and
questions about the maintenance requirements, liability exposure, and
accessibility requirements of such devices. In the last five years, the
private car industry has been increasingly using the crash avoidance
technologies to prevent or mitigate crashes with pedestrians and
bicyclists. Approaches that hold promises are radar, laser and
camera-based vision systems which are designed to spot pedestrians and
bicyclists entering a vehicle's path and either warn the driver or
automatically apply the vehicle\u2019s brake if the driver fails to
react fast enough.For this SBIR solicitation, FTA is seeking exploratory
 proposals that will demonstrate innovative, economically-viable,
accurate, and durable technologies or devices to significantly improve
the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists in a transit environment. The
primary goal of this project is to design and develop detection
technologies or devices that use sensors technologies in detection of
bicycles and pedestrians by leveraging innovations and developments that
 have occurred in commercial\/passenger vehicle applications. The
proposer must clearly define the uniqueness of the stand-alone system
and the associated pedestrian\/cyclist detection technologies and how
the system would be integrated into existing transit buses for the
following collision scenarios and mitigation - 1) at the street
intersection in which the system is designed to mitigate and prevent
(left turn, right turn, etc.), 2) at the bus stop while it is pulling in
 and out of transit stops, and 3) other scenarios in which the bus might
 strike pedestrians or cyclists.The project must identify and
characterize the effectiveness of the proposed system in a bus and how
the system would:detect pedestrians and cyclists under different
collision scenariosprevent or mitigate the severity of crashes (ex.
warning to bus operator or warning to bus operator\/ automatic
braking)consider the human factor applications in terms of bus operator
workload. Project proposals must include a methodology on how the small
business will use data to quantitatively demonstrate that its innovative
 technology can truly improve transit system and its
safety.&amp;nbsp;Expected Phase I Outcomes&amp;nbsp; 1. A viable
proof-of-concept that demonstrates the potential for a technology or
device in a transit environment to improve safety of pedestrian and
cyclist. The proof-of concept must consider the following
factors:Efficient and low-cost technologyModular, interoperable,
plug-and-play and open source (if applicable) device(s)Technology
assessment with respect to industry best practices&amp;nbsp; 2.
Feasibility analysis (data proven) for success in developing a working

Neurologic Outcomes (R43\/R44)",
        "description": "Background\nImproving pregnancy outcome is a
prime mission for Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development (NICHD). Neonatal neurologic disease
contributes a significant burden to patients, their families and
society. Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) affects up to 3.3\/1000 term and
late preterm infants in the developed world. Hypoxic ischemic
encephalopathy (HIE), a subset of neonatal encephalopathy, affects
1-2\/1000 infants per year. Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the outcomes
associated with NE and HIE, and approximately 30% of term and late
preterm CP will have neonatal encephalopathy. The prevalence of CP is
2\/1000 live births and approximately two thirds are born at term or
late preterm. Premature infants, infants with metabolic disease, and
sequelae of complications in the neonatal period can lead to significant
 neurologic morbidity. Technologies to assess pregnancies at risk for
infants with deleterious neurologic outcomes as well as tools to treat
such infants are needed to affect outcome. A workshop held in May 2013
at NICHD highlighted the need for continued support.\nResearch
Objectives and Scope\nThe goal of this initiative is to develop tools
and technology for diagnosis, intervention and improvement of outcomes
for pregnancies and infants with known neurologic disease or infants at
high risk for neurologic complications. There is a need to foster
collaboration between clinical and bioengineering research investigators
 in the field of tools and technologies for assessment of pregnancies
and infants with or at risk of neurologic complications. This FOA
invites SBCs to propose innovative research that can lead to development
 of non-invasive, or minimally invasive, instruments, devices, tools,
and technologies to assess, monitor, and treat women during pregnancy as
 well as neonates and infants with or at high risk for neurologic
problems.\nProjects involving biomarker identification, and development
of tools to screen, prognosticate, and diagnose high risk and at risk
pregnancies and infants, novel neuroprotective agents and strategies, as
 well as interventions for neurologic disorders would be deemed
responsive to this initiative.\nSpecific areas of interest could
include, but are not limited to:\n\nAssessment of fetal neural
integrity\nIntrapartum neurologic assessment and
monitoring\nNeuroprotective resuscitation tools\nNovel methods of
monitoring and delivering hypothermic neural rescue, particularly during
 high risk transport\nNovel strategies to improve neurologic function in
 infants affected with neurologic conditions, particularly those infants
 at highest risk for cerebral palsy\nNon-invasive or minimally invasive
tools of assessment of neurologic function including blood flow, oxygen
delivery and utilization, seizure detection and management, and methods
to monitor other systemic organ functions in high-risk infants affected
by neurological illnesses; simple tools to assess status of sleep and
wakefulness; and physiologic function\nThe tools and methods to screen
special sensory systems (visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory); and
tools to assess and grade pain perception\nTools and methods to assess
the integrity of the autonomic nervous system, including studies related
 to the study of gut motility and function\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe proposed
studies should establish the accuracy and safety of the tool being
developed under varied clinical conditions. Studies may range from
concept to developmental phases, with the goal of developing
technologies that can be marketed, and used in regular clinical settings
 for pregnant women and newborn infants.&amp;nbsp;",

decisions; support inferences based on individual or population health
data, multiple sources of potentially conflicting information, while
complying with applicable policies and preferences; enable the secondary
 use of health data to support the assisted and automated discovery of
reliable knowledge from aggregated population health records and the

        "topic_name": "Electronic Hardware, Robotics and Wireless
Technologies (EW)",
        "description": "Sensors (SE) Recent technological advancements
in materials science and bioengineered systems have made inexpensive,
powerful, and ubiquitous sensing a reality. Examples range from truly
smart airframes and self-evaluating buildings and infrastructure for
natural hazard mitigation to large-scale weather forecasting,
self-organizing energy systems, and smart devices that self-assemble
into networks leading to the first electronic nervous system that
connects the Internet back to the physical world. New detection
technologies that overcome barriers of time, scale, materials, and
environment, and emphasize self-calibration, selectivity, and
sensitivity are solicited. With the convergence of MEMS, wireless,
wearables, and the Internet of Things, the sales of sensors in the U.S.
alone are expected to climb to nearly $15 billion in 2016.Wireless
Technologies (WT) Wireless has become the platform for many applications
 with direct impact on virtually every aspect of life, evolving well
beyond mobile phones and PDAs to other devices, services, channels, and
content. Microwave circuits afford wider frequency spectrum and very
short antennae. With GaAs and SiGe, entire microwave transceivers can be
 inexpensively placed on a single chip. Modulation methods like
spread-spectrum and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing bring
greater spectral efficiency and more bits\/Hz of bandwidth, and lead to
less susceptibility to noise, interference, and multi-path distortion.
On-chip DSPs allow new signal-processing functions. RFID chips are
providing improvements in warehousing, materials handling, and shipping
operations, replacing bar-code labels in many areas.WT1. Systems and
DevicesProposals that involve next generation wireless communication
technologies requiring systems with high data rates, low cost, and that
support a wide variety of applications and services, while maintaining
full mobility, minimum latency, and long battery life are sought.
Innovations that improve spectral efficiency on an instantaneous basis,
such as mitigation of unwanted emissions, improvements in filter
technology, interference cancellation, etc., and improvements on a
system-wide basis, such as dynamic spectrum access, frequency re-use,
and innovative millimeter wave and THz frequency devices and systems.
Reconfigurable wireless platforms, such as cognitive radio,
software-defined radio, novel hardware\/software co-design, adaptive
antennas, etc., to dynamically implement incentive mechanisms and
spectrum policy, facilitate the coexistence of multiple dynamic spectrum
 access networks, and optimize network performance. Innovative solutions
 for systems may include medical devices, surveillance, and remote
sensing. New technology that can result in improvements in spectrum
efficiency and access will require new test and measurement solutions
and standards and regulatory validation. In addition, measurements and
metrics to establish existing and future levels of spectrum occupancy
and efficiency will be required. New and novel measurement-based
spectrum management techniques, including agent-based systems,
policy-based spectrum management, and local and scalable spectrum
management are welcome. Novel network radio architecture facilitating
the interplay between network layers and enabling more network
functionalities, e.g., network topology awareness, network coding,
cross-layer optimization, and multiple-input-multipleoutput (MIMO) are
also welcome.WT2. Spectrum UsageAppropriate for this subtopic are
spectral accounting techniques enabling equitable sharing; the
development and enhancement of RFI detection and suppression techniques
for use in RFI cancellation and filtering, matched filtering, and
polarization-based algorithms and multiple antenna algorithms so that
more spectrum can be shared with active services. Proposal involving
advanced spectrum sensing techniques to quickly and accurately identify
transmission opportunities over a very wide spectrum pool that may host a
 large number of different wireless services are sought. Security and
privacy solutions in the context of spectrum sharing are also
appropriate, in addition to mechanisms that can enforce the proper
operation of dynamic spectrum access and are robust against malicious
attacks. Coexistence with legacy systems, such as backwards and forward
interoperability and compatibility will be important. A major challenge
of moving to a new and more efficient spectrum-use model will be a
lengthy and complex transition period that will allow for the
co-existence of novel systems and regulations with the multitude of
existing legacy systems and regulations. Special-purpose wireless
systems may be difficult to accommodate within bold new spectrum-use
models because of fundamental limitations on frequency agility due to
basic operational requirements, extreme sensitivity to interference, or
potentially drastic consequences due to failure of a radio frequency
(RF) link. Energy-efficient and robust spectrum sensing and allocation
mechanisms and protocol support will be needed.&amp;nbsp;Energy and
Power Management (EP) In the power electronics realm, as CMOS chips go
to finer lithography with each new generation, their multiplying
transistors require lower voltages and higher currents. These trends
have driven up power demands on printed circuit boards and placed
constant pressure on power-supply and power-system developers to
increase the efficiency and power or current density. At the same time,
the trends toward lower voltages and higher currents have encouraged
migration from centralized to distributed and portable power
architectures.EP1. Electronic Devices, Boards and InterfacesNewer chips
with lower supply-voltage requirements has greatly complicated
power-system and powersupply design. Innovations in the areas of
low-power device design and manufacturing as well as printed circuit and
 other boards that will operate at lower power and longer lifetimes are
welcome.EP2. Sustainable Energy Harvesting, Storage and Management -
Device and System LevelProposals are solicited in the areas of
electronic systems for portable energy sources for mobile technologies
and off-grid type applications, including new energy sources. Proposals
in the areas of power management systems for energy
scavenging\/harvesting and compact energy conversion systems, conversion
 from renewable resources, interface devices between batteries and
super-capacitors as well as smart power demand-response management
systems are welcome. Proposals with ideas on nature-inspired processes
for sustainable energy solutions and carbon storage, reducing the carbon
 and resource intensity of hydrocarbon extraction, energy conversion,
and its uses are sought. Innovative projects may include new critical
devices, components, and systems for energy harvesting and conversion
from renewable resources (excluding solar technologies). Refer to PH
topic for solar technologies.EP3. Smart Grids and
InfrastructureProposals that address innovations in new technologies
that support smart infrastructures (such as materials, sensors, devices,
 and control systems) to ensure efficient and sustainable energy
transmission, distribution, monitoring, and management are sought.EP4.
Power ManagementInnovations in the areas of (but not limited to) novel
voltage conversion, micro-inverters and DC-DC voltage converters, and
compact hi-voltage, hi-power systems, and wireless transmission of
electricity are welcome. Proposals covering new energy sources for
portable and mobile devices, smart power demand-response management
systems (e.g. smart grids, buildings, and circuits), inverters, motors,
compact nuclear fusion reactors, and generators for higher efficiency,
smaller size and power factor corrections are
encouraged.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Robotics and Human Assistive Technologies
 (RH) Considerable progress will be made if robots possessed the high
intelligence needed to cope with uncertainty, learn from experience, and
 work as a team. Robot designers are borrowing features from insect
nervous systems, and engineers and computer scientists collaborate with

in the study of the brain and behavior. Some robots will help people do
what they can't or would rather not do. Other robots will tackle complex
 projects by working as teams. Robots will help protect critical
infrastructure and monitor the environment as mobile, intelligent
sensors. High-performance processors, hardware to provide situational
awareness, and improved artificial intelligence (AI) are enabling
researchers to create lifelike robots with an entire gamut of facial
expressions.RH1. Learning, Intelligence and MotionProposals addressing

        "description": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly
evolving field that involves the interconnection and interaction of
smart objects (objects or devices with embedded sensors, onboard data
processing capability, and a means of communication) to provide
automated services that would otherwise not be possible. IoT is not a
single technology, but rather involves the convergence of sensor,
information, communication, and actuation technologies.Today, most of
what we consider as IoT is a variety of largely stand-alone devices and
isolated systems, such as wearable fitness monitors, home thermostats
and lighting, remote video streaming, smartphones, and smart watches.
Emerging IoT implementations will use smaller and more energy- efficient
 embedded sensor technologies, enhanced communications, advanced data
analytics, and more sophisticated actuators to collect and aggregate
information and enable intelligent systems that understand context,
track and manage complex interactions, and anticipate requirements.IoT
is expected to become ubiquitous, with implementations in the smart home
 - management of energy use, control of appliances, monitoring of food
and other consumables; consumer applications - health and fitness
monitoring, condition diagnosis; manufacturing and industrial settings -
 supply chain management, robotic manufacturing, quality control, health
 and safety compliance; utility grids and other critical infrastructure -
 grid optimization, automated fault diagnosis, automated cyber security
monitoring and response; and automotive\/transportation - optimization
for driving conditions, assessing driver alertness, collision\/accident
avoidance, managing vehicle health.Proposals are encouraged that address
 key challenges across the full range of IoT applications.IoT1. IoT
Sensors and ActuatorsIoT is on track to connect 50 billion "smart"
things by 2020, and one trillion sensors soon after. This subtopic
includes (but is not limited to) innovations in device and materials
technology to enable new sensor functionality, further sensor
miniaturization, improved sensor performance or more efficient energy
use; actuator technologies to enable new IoT functionalities; and device
 packaging innovations that enable further sensor or actuator
miniaturization and embedding in a greater range of smart objects and
devices.IoT2. IoT Energy and Power SystemsMany of the components that
enable IoT will have to operate in severely power constrained network
edge environments, requiring improvements in energy efficiency in
simple, low-cost systems. In many cases, the devices will not have a
consistent power supply, and local energy harvesting will therefore be
required. This subtopic includes (but is not limited to) novel power
management integrated circuits aimed at miniaturizing devices and
increasing energy efficiency; power management systems for energy
harvesting to enable mobile or remote IoT devices and systems; and smart
 power protocols for IoT devices. This subtopic can also include broader
 categories of energy-efficient technologies to enable mobile IoT
applications, such as displays, power efficient IC's, and innovative
mobile battery solutions.IoT3. IoT CommunicationsEnabling ubiquitous
connectivity and the aggregation of IoT data presents key data
processing and communications challenges as the industry tries to
simplify and define how "smart" things interact. A wide variety of
communication solutions, both wired and wireless, will likely emerge.
This subtopic includes (but is not limited to) innovations that will
substantially improve the underlying technical performance, or extend
the functionality, of IoT communication systems. Particular emphasis is
placed on low-power and dataefficient communications schemes, as these
are required to enable IoT in resource-constrained environments.
Examples of relevant technical fields include (but are not limited to):
short range and long distance transmission technologies - optical, RF,
microwave or ultrasonic; communication signal sources and detectors -
optical (lasers, LEDs, photodetectors), RF, microwave or ultrasonic; and
 electronic or optoelectronic signal processing technologies to
facilitate efficient low-power data transmission or reception.IoT4. IoT
Integrated SystemsMany of the benefits of IoT require the full
integration of complex systems to enable developers to build innovative
service delivery platforms. This subtopic includes (but is not limited
to) new design and development platforms that facilitate widespread
adoption of IoT; IoT systems with the flexibility to allow rapid
development and deployment of new use cases and functionalities; and
shared platforms designed for lean, power-constrained environments that
enable the easy integration of sensors and actuators, communication
technologies, and data processing to create new business models for
IoT.IoT IT. Cloud, Big Data and Security and Privacy (see IT portfolio
topics)Data is rapidly emerging as the most important currency driving
IoT. Offloading computation to the cloud, providing overall system
security, and guaranteeing the privacy of users remain key challenges in
 IoT. Companies developing innovations in these spaces should refer to
the IT topics of this SBIR\/STTR solicitation.&amp;nbsp;Agency

        "description": "Information Technologies (IT)Information
technology is increasingly impacting almost every aspect of our lives,
from communicating with friends and family to manufacturing of the
products we use, the efficient supply of food, the provision of
healthcare services, and the performance of financial markets and our
nation's economy.&amp;nbsp;The past decade has seen explosive growth in
the generation of data and the creation of usable information from that
data. This growth is expected to accelerate into the foreseeable future,
 fueled in part by the increasing interconnectedness of the products and
 services that we use.&amp;nbsp;This topic encourages the submission of
proposals that present ground-breaking innovations in the generation,
analysis, use, transmission or protection of information, where such
innovations offer the potential for substantial commercial returns and a
 positive impact on society and the world in which we live. The
subtopics below provide specific examples of technologies and
applications, although given the enormous range and diversity in the
field of IT these examples are inevitably incomplete. Proposals are
encouraged under any of the specific subtopics IT1 to IT13. Proposals
that do not fit these subtopics can be submitted under the subtopic
"IT14: Other"&amp;nbsp;IT1. Artificial Intelligence; Machine Learning;
Natural Language ProcessingThis subtopic focuses on information
technology innovations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI),
which refers to intelligence exhibited by machines or software. AI is
usually limited or targeted in nature, with general machine-based
intelligence remaining an elusive long-term goal.Included in this
subtopic are the technical sub-specialties of machine learning and
natural language processing (NLP), both of which are disciplines within
the broader field of artificial intelligence. Machine learning refers to
 processes in which an automated system can learn from data, rather than
 following a pre- specified set of rules, and in many cases can predict
outcomes relating to the learned process. The aim of NLP is to extract
information or derive meaning from human language (written or spoken) or
 to generate human language.&amp;nbsp;There are many technical
approaches to AI, and an even greater diversity of potential
applications. Examples of relevant technical fields include (but are not
 limited to): deep learning; artificial neural networks of various
types; supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised machine learning;
machine learning algorithms; pattern recognition; image recognition;
machine vision; fuzzy logic; uncertain reasoning using probabilistic
methods; named entity recognition; sentiment analysis; natural language
understanding; natural language generation; automatic summarization;
language translation; analysis of structured or unstructured text;
speech recognition; speech analysis; speech
processing.&amp;nbsp;Applications of AI include (but are not limited
to): robotics, including in automated manufacturing; industrial
controllers; self-driving cars; analysis of online commentary; stock
market analysis; optimization of finance operations and stock
investments; analysis of medical records; clinical decision support
systems for medical diagnosis; automated interpretation of medical test
data (e.g. ultrasound scan data); cybersecurity; intrusion detection
\u2013 in software systems, communications networks and sensor systems;
fraud detection; cyber-physical control systems; improvements in
human-computer interaction; automated document classification, indexing
and retrieval; customer recommendation systems; personalization of
customer services; intelligent virtual assistants; search engines,
including image-based search; translation services (including
speech-to-speech translation).&amp;nbsp;IT2. Image and VideoThis
subtopic focuses on information technology innovations that enhance the
acquisition, processing, interpretation and use of images or video. This
 includes both innovations in human perception and use of images or
video, and innovations in machine vision. The terms "image" and "video"
should be interpreted in their broadest sense \u2013 image or video
simply refers to static or time-varying data (respectively) that are
representative of certain properties of the subject and that may be
acquired optically or via ultrasound, X- ray, MRI, PET, or any other
measurement technique. Applications are many and varied, ranging from
cell- phone based 3D modeling to medical image processing for improved
diagnostic accuracy and enhancements for robotic manufacturing systems.
Deployment platforms may range from mobile devices (cell phones and
tablets) to industrial settings (manufacturing
plants).&amp;nbsp;Examples of relevant technical fields include (but are
 not limited to): automated image\/video indexing and retrieval; object
recognition; pattern recognition; facial recognition; recognition of
human actions and behavior (e.g., in video surveillance applications);
automated video categorization; video summarization; generation and
manipulation of 3D models; image\/video enhancement; image\/video
feature extraction and identification.&amp;nbsp;Many innovations in
image and video processing rely on underlying methods developed more
broadly in the field of artificial intelligence. Innovations employing
artificial intelligence technologies should be submitted to this
subtopic if they are primarily aimed at image or video based
applications.&amp;nbsp;IT3. Quantum Information TechnologiesThis
subtopic focuses on innovations in information and communications
technologies that rely fundamentally on quantum mechanical properties
and interactions. Typically such technologies generate, detect or
manipulate quantum states in order to provide faster, more efficient or
more secure information processing and communications.&amp;nbsp;Included
 in this subtopic are innovations at the component, sub-system and
system level that result in substantial and usable improvements in the
generation, transmission, detection, storage or processing of
information, or the security and privacy of
information.&amp;nbsp;Proposed innovations must offer the potential for
robustness, reliability and scalability, with operation at or near room
temperature being a feasible objective. Components and sub-systems
should aim for compactness and energy efficiency, consistent with the
requirements of the intended application.Innovations that involve
quantum communications over significant distances should preferably be
deployable in current fiber-optic infrastructure or using current
optical fiber technology.&amp;nbsp;Examples of relevant technical fields
 include (but are not limited to): single photon sources and detectors;
generation, transmission and detection of qubits; entangled photon
sources; generation, manipulation and detection of entangled qubits;
quantum repeaters; quantum memories; quantum frequency conversion (e.g.
to telecoms wavelengths); superdense coding; quantum error correction;
quantum information processing; quantum algorithms. This subtopic covers
 a wide range of technical sub-specialties, and these examples are
intended only to be indicative.&amp;nbsp;Examples of relevant areas of
application include (but are not limited to): quantum key distribution;
quantum cryptography; quantum communications links and networks;
network-based authentication; quantum computing.&amp;nbsp;Proposals
submitted to this subtopic must be aimed ultimately at
commercialization, and should address the likely timeline to develop a
minimum viable product or service. Proposals should address practical
problems\u2013 such as, for example, the efficient and reliable coupling
 of single photon sources to optical fibers \u2013 that will need to be
overcome in order for the proposed innovation to be commercially
feasible.&amp;nbsp;IT4. Cybersecurity; Authentication; PrivacyThis
subtopic is intended to cover the major aspects of security related to
the internet (except for Internet of Things cybersecurity, which is
covered under subtopic IT5).&amp;nbsp;Cybersecurity refers to security
applied both to the internet (including servers and connected devices)
and to data stored in or transmitted over the internet. Generally this
refers to security against malicious attacks rather than security
against (for example) inadvertent data leakage. Cybersecurity is growing
 in importance due to a confluence of factors, including (i) increased
use of the internet to monitor and control critical infrastructure, (ii)
 increased incidence of cyber-attacks against government and major
institutions, (iii) the growing reliance by the general public on
internet-based services.Authentication refers to the reliable
authentication of persons using the internet and devices connected to
the internet, while privacy refers to the protection against compromise
of personal information and user data.&amp;nbsp;Examples of relevant
technical fields include (but are not limited to): detection of cyber
vulnerabilities \u2013 for example, related to critical infrastructure
or financial networks; detection and prevention of cyber-attacks; human
factors analytics \u2013 to assess people risk; mobile device security;
device-cloud security infrastructure; cloud computing security;
security\/privacy policy compliance; security for BYOD (bring-your-own
device) and BYOC (bring-your-own-cloud); big data security; data loss
prevention; information assurance; data integrity; encryption; key
generation, key management and key distribution; access authorization;
identity management; personal authentication \u2013 biometrics,
multi-factor authentication.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;IT5. Cybersecurity for
the Internet of ThingsThe Internet of Things (IoT) is widely touted as
the next wave of internet expansion, connecting embedded sensing and
control electronics in everyday products ranging from cars to
refrigerators, televisions, wearable electronics and other smart
objects, as well as enabling new system visibility and control in
industrial applications such as utility grids (the so-called "smart
grid") and improved healthcare through smart health applications (e.g.,
heart monitoring implants and implanted continuous glucose monitoring
sensors). ABI Research estimates that the number of active connected
devices will exceed 40 billion by 2020, more than double the estimated
number in 2014, with roughly 75% of the growth coming from sensor nodes
and other network-edge devices \u2013 i.e., IoT devices. Each IoT device
 provides an access point to the internet and therefore also offers an
opportunity for cyber-attack. Currently most IoT devices incorporate
little or no security, which combined with their increasing ubiquity
presents an alarming scenario for future internet security, particularly
 because IoT devices are expected to influence or even control many
aspects of our lives.&amp;nbsp;Most IoT devices operate in resource
constrained environments. Usually they are subject to severe energy
usage limits, with low bandwidth (and sometimes sporadic) communications
 to the internet, limited computing power and little on-board data
storage. These characteristics present unique operational challenges and
 also unique challenges in providing an effective defense against
cyber-attacks.&amp;nbsp;This subtopic calls for new and innovative
approaches to providing cybersecurity for IoT systems. Proposed
solutions should not be limited to conventional cybersecurity techniques
 \u2013 the unique characteristics of IoT systems are likely to require
new and unconventional cybersecurity methods. Proposing companies are
encouraged to think outside the box.Note: This subtopic is focused on
cybersecurity innovations pertaining to IoT. Hardware innovations
related to IoT should be submitted to the Internet of Things (I)
topic.&amp;nbsp;IT6. Networking TechnologyThis subtopic focuses on

software defined networking and software defined storage;
software-defined data centers; analytics to optimize network
performance; network visualization; network protocols; technologies to

data storage and retrieval technologies; anywhere\/anytime access to
data and services; agile networking; machine-to-machine networking;
peer-to- peer device networking; networking technologies for
resource-constrained sensor-dense environments such as in IoT
applications.Note: This subtopic includes IT-based innovations
pertaining to IoT networking technology. Hardware innovations related to
 IoT should be submitted to the Internet of Things (I)
topic.&amp;nbsp;IT7. Mobile Computing; Internet of ThingsThis subtopic
focuses on information technology innovations that will improve the
performance or functionality of mobile devices and devices that operate
in resource-constrained environments \u2013 such as in Internet of
Things (IoT) applications. While there is some overlap with other
subtopics, proposals submitted to this subtopic should be focused on
innovations specifically intended for these platforms.Examples of
relevant technical fields include (but are not limited to): location
technology; image recognition and processing; video processing; speech
recognition and generation; translation services; improved human to
mobile device interfaces; gesture and expression recognition and
processing; bio-signal processing; crowdsourced storage; crowdsourced
processing; device-cloud architecture; context-relevant analytics and
services \u2013 i.e., involving situational and environmental
information; data analytics and data processing to facilitate the
Internet of Things; vehicle-based computing platforms.Note: This
subtopic includes IT-based innovations pertaining to IoT devices.
Hardware innovations related to IoT should be submitted to the Internet
of Things (I) topic.&amp;nbsp;IT8. Cloud Computing; High-Performance
ComputingCloud computing is characterized by the allocation of
internet-based distributed computing resources on an as-needed basis
across a shared platform. Multiple computing cores may be dedicated in
parallel to achieve the required computing performance levels for a
specific task. Similarly, high performance computing usually relies on
the use of a large number of co-located or distributed cores running in
parallel. To achieve the highest levels of performance, massively
parallel supercomputers may employ many thousands of
cores.&amp;nbsp;This subtopic focuses on innovations that result in
substantial improvements to cloud computing or high performance
computing platforms. These improvements may be in terms of computing
power, computing efficiency, energy management, network storage
requirements, the use of hybrid clouds, latency, data integrity and
availability, cost, or any other factor of importance in such platforms,
 and may result from software- or hardware-based innovations. Included
in this subtopic are innovations that will enable continued improvement
in the performance of HPC platforms in the so-called post- Moore\u2019s
Law era.Examples of applications that typically require the levels of
computing power available through cloud computing or high performance
computing include (but are not limited to): stock market analysis and
prediction; cryptanalysis; weather forecasting; fluid dynamic modelling,
 acoustic modelling and other computationally intensive engineering
modelling; advanced audio and video signal processing.&amp;nbsp;IT9.

the provision of new or improved cloud-based IT services to address
issues of commercial and societal importance. Such services may be
directed primarily to businesses or consumers. Examples include (but are
 not limited to): processing of medical data such as X- ray, ultrasound,
 MRI or CT scans; business data analytics; sentiment analysis; analysis

Virtual Reality; Augmented RealityThese three closely related fields
encompass technologies that facilitate interactions among humans,
computers and the external world and thereby enable many societally
beneficial uses of information technology.&amp;nbsp;The field of
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is focused on improving the efficiency
and effectiveness of human-computer interfaces through the development
of novel software and hardware designs to recognize and interpret human
characteristics and behavior. Improvements in HCI technology can lead to
 enhanced virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) experiences by
 providing more natural and efficient ways for a user to interact with a
 real or virtual environment.&amp;nbsp;Technical sub-specialties within
HCI are broad and varied, including (but not limited to): machine
learning to anticipate and meet a user's needs; speech recognition;

biosignal detection and processing. These technologies may be
implemented on wearable devices such as smart watches, smart glasses and
 health trackers.&amp;nbsp;Virtual Reality involves providing sensory
input to a user that replicates being present in a real or imagined
environment. Most commonly the sensory input is limited to sight and
sound, but it can also include other senses such as touch. Augmented
Reality, on the other hand, involves a live direct or indirect
experience of an environment, overlaid with computer-generated sensory
input usually in the form of graphics, video and\/or
sound.&amp;nbsp;Applications of VR and AR include (but are not limited
to): education \u2013 enhanced learning experiences; medical and
healthcare \u2013 treatments for PTSD, phantom pain, anxieties and
phobias, autism in children; support for complex tasks such as surgery,
equipment assembly, or maintenance and repair by adding relevant
information to the field of view of the user; training for medical
personnel, law enforcement, military, and emergency responders;

 on crowdsourced information; collaborative healthcare; the sharing
economy; professional networks; B2B networking; image and video centric
networks; micro video; social networking tools; visual content
optimization (image and video) for social media; video
sharing.&amp;nbsp;IT13. SoftwareThis subtopic focuses on information
technology innovations that are embodied in software and provide
important new or enhanced capabilities that will usually be generalized,
 rather than directed to a specific use case. Examples of such
capabilities include (but are not limited to): enhanced computational
speed or efficiency; new or improved functionality; improved or extended
 performance; increased ease of use and accessibility.&amp;nbsp;The
range of possible innovations under this subtopic is too broad to
attempt to describe here. Past examples of significant software
innovations cover a wide range of technical approaches and resulting new
 capabilities, and include (but are obviously not limited to):
Object-Oriented Programming; the GUI; HTTP; HTML; TCP\/IP; SQL; internet
 search engine(s); the spreadsheet; word processing; MapReduce;

allocation of internet-based distributed computing resources on an
as-needed basis across a shared platform. Multiple computing cores may
be dedicated in parallel to achieve the required computing performance
levels for a specific task. Similarly, high performance computing
usually relies on the use of a large number of co-located or distributed
 cores running in parallel. To achieve the highest levels of
performance, massively parallel supercomputers may employ many thousands
 of cores.This subtopic focuses on innovations that result in
substantial improvements to cloud computing or high performance
computing platforms. These improvements may be in terms of computing
power, computing efficiency, energy management, network storage
requirements, the use of hybrid clouds, latency, data integrity and
availability, cost, or any other factor of importance in such platforms,
 and may result from software- or hardware-based innovations. Included
in this subtopic are innovations that will enable continued improvement
in the performance of HPC platforms in the so-called post- Moore\u2019s

Develop New or Improved Closed Loop Automated Technologies for Diabetes
Therapy and Monitoring (R43\/R44)",
        "description": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the
autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreatic
islets of Langerhans and affects more than one million Americans,
usually with onset in childhood or young adulthood. The disease markedly
 impairs quality of life and shortens lifespan primarily through
premature mortality.&amp;nbsp; T1D is associated with numerous
complications including blindness, renal failure, painful nerve
disorders, and amputation.&amp;nbsp; In addition to its devastating toll
 in human suffering, T1D and its complications result in significant
health care expenditures for families and constitute a major societal
economic burden.\nClinical Trials have demonstrated significant
reductions in complications of T1D through intensive control of blood
glucose levels.&amp;nbsp; However, despite the availability of
increasingly effective treatment modalities, including insulin
analogues, continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and continuous
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) devices, a substantial proportion
of patients with T1D cannot achieve optimal glycemic control despite
enormous efforts.&amp;nbsp; Compounding this difficulty is the trade-off
 between improved glycemic control and an increased risk for potentially
 life-threatening hypoglycemia.\nA viable option for the treatment of
diabetes is a system (artificial pancreas or closed-loop) that can mimic
 normal pancreatic beta cell function thereby restoring normal metabolic
 homeostasis without causing hypoglycemia.&amp;nbsp; However, there are
important technological obstacles such as glucose-sensing inaccuracies,
imperfect algorithms for calculating the appropriate dose of
insulin\/glucagon taking into consideration diet and physical activity,
insulin pumps\u2019 mechanical problems, time delay from subcutaneous
insulin infusion to pharmacologic effect, biocompatibility issues and
data transmission, inter-device communication deficiencies that need to
be resolved through the development of new technologies that may lead to
 integrated\/automated devices.&amp;nbsp; The ultimate research goal
would be the development of mechanical or bio-artificial systems that
may improve metabolic control and decrease glycemic excursions robustly
preventing hypoglycemic episodes.\nThis FOA is intended to support
cutting edge research conducted by small business leading to the
development of innovative technologies that may advance progress toward
an integrated, long term, automated, wearable, glucose regulated
insulin\/pancreatic hormone delivery closed loop system.&amp;nbsp; This
announcement has two main purposes: a) promote technical innovation and
b) pre-clinical or clinical testing of single or combined components of a
 closed loop system.&amp;nbsp; Examples of projects that this
announcement intends to attract include but are not limited to:\n1.
Glucose sensors and pancreatic hormones delivery systems:\n\nDevelopment
 of novel and more accurate non-enzymatic based glucose detection
technologies.\nDevelopment of new miniaturized, implantable or minimally
 invasive continuous glucose sensors with long functional life (at least
 4 weeks), real time measurement, with no or minimal need of
recalibration, easily implanted and replaced, unobtrusive to the user
and accurate at low glycemic levels.\nDevelopment of redundant
continuous glucose monitoring technologies that may provide sufficient
data to allow automated hormone delivery to target euglycemia with
minimal risk for overdose\nApplication of nanotechnology advances to the
 design of new glucose sensing and insulin delivery
devices.\n&amp;nbsp;Development of miniaturized multisensor platforms
able to detect glucose and other metabolically relevant analytes. For
instance, integration of insulin sensors to a closed loop
platform.\nDevelopment of novel biocompatible smart biomaterials to be
used for the manufacturing of implantable devices.\nDevelopment of
implantable biohybrids matrices\/membranes that may release bioactive
agents which either promote vascularization and\/or inhibit the
inflammatory\/fibrotic response allowing higher biocompatibility and
longer durability of devices.\nDevelopment of injectable\/implantable
glucose regulated insulin\/glucagon delivery systems\/depots able to
function in a homeostatic fashion lasting days\/weeks.\nDevelopment of
highly concentrated and stable insulin formulations that are more
rapidly absorbed for closed loop insulin delivery.\nNovel and more
stable glucagon formulations that could be used in a closed loop
system.\nNew, more advanced insulin\/glucagon delivery devices\/pumps,
external or implantable able to be integrated in a closed loop
system.&amp;nbsp; For instance:&amp;nbsp; Dual chamber pumps for multi
hormonal therapy.\nSmarter pump technologies - pumps that directly or
indirectly monitor and track insulin delivered for use with
Algorithms.\n\n2. Algorithms and Integrated Systems:\n\nDevelopment of
reliable and integrated algorithms that translate accurate glucose
measurements into changes in the delivery of pancreatic hormones in

and portable controllers.\nTechnologies that improve or facilitate
information visualization and integration of data for analysis and more

RNAs in the Nervous System (R43\/R44)",
        "description": "Background\nChemical modifications play a
crucial role in the regulation of biological processes.&amp;nbsp; For
example, the function of a protein is often modulated by its stable
tagging with phosphates, sugars, or lipids, while epigenomic marks on
DNA or histones can help dial gene expression up or down.&amp;nbsp; One
area that lags behind is the systematic characterization of all the
chemical modifications that can befall RNA molecules (both coding and
non-coding), sometimes referred to as the
\u201cepitranscriptome.\u201d&amp;nbsp; A few covalent RNA
modifications, such as 5\u2019mRNA capping, alternative splicing,
editing, and polyadenylation, have been studied extensively, and recent
evidence suggests that some RNA modifications have interesting
biological and disease functions in mammals.&amp;nbsp; However, the
functional roles of many other covalent RNA modifications remain poorly
characterized or unknown, although they are likely to influence RNA
properties and functions such as RNA stability, trafficking,
localization, activity, and patterns of interactions with other
molecules.&amp;nbsp;\nThe RNA Modification Database indicates that there
 are 66 known RNA modifications that occur in eukaryotic
cells.&amp;nbsp; Many of these modifications occur in mammalian
cells.&amp;nbsp; Transfer and ribosomal RNA have been shown to be
heavily modified and some of these same modifications also occur in
messenger RNA, and non-coding RNAs (including microRNAs).&amp;nbsp; With
 respect to brain phenotypes, some of these RNA modifications have been
shown to play a role in intellectual disability, microcephaly, myoclonus
 epilepsy, excitotoxic cell death, depression, schizophrenia, and
addiction-relevant behaviors.&amp;nbsp; For example, NSun2, an enzyme
that deposits m5C on RNA, has been associated with human autosomal
recessive intellectual disability and also with two additional syndromes
 with intellectual disability phenotypes.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, recent
studies have identified N6-methyladenosine (m6A) sites in thousands of
human mRNAs and suggest that this modification may play a role in
regulation of alternative splicing and gene expression.&amp;nbsp;
Interestingly Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO), enzymatically demethylates m6A
 in RNA, an activity that appears to affect dopamine function in mouse
midbrain and striatum.\nThe major obstacles hampering our efforts to
better understand RNA modifications are fundamentally technical in
nature.&amp;nbsp; Presently, we lack appropriate tools and technologies
for investigating the epitranscriptome broadly and at single nucleotide
resolution.&amp;nbsp; This problem is compounded by the fact that the
most effective and powerful assays we have today to study the
transcriptome begin with a reverse transcription step that either erases
 the native modifications that exist on the original RNA molecule or is
prematurely aborted when the reverse transcriptase encounters certain
modifications.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;\nResearch Objectives\nDespite the
growing interest in and importance of RNA modifications, the available
tools that scientists have to monitor and manipulate modified RNAs are
extremely limited.&amp;nbsp; The purpose of this initiative is to
incentivize small businesses to generate tools, technologies, and
products for monitoring and manipulating covalently modified eukaryotic
RNA, including messenger RNA and regulatory RNA.&amp;nbsp; In the long
term, it is hoped that these tools and products will serve as the
foundation for NIDA-relevant research into the potential roles of RNA
modifications in both HIV\/AIDS infection and progression as well as
into the molecular mechanisms of substance abuse disorders and
co-occurring psychiatric disorders.&amp;nbsp;\nTwo companion FOAs have
been released in this scientific area:&amp;nbsp; RFA-DA-16-006 describes
 the STTR R41\/R42 mechanism, while this FOA (RFA-DA-16-005) describes
the SBIR R43\/R44 mechanism.&amp;nbsp; If the innovative tool to be
commercialized will be developed via a partnership of ideas between a
small business and an academic\/non-profit research institution, the
program director\/principal investigator should consider applying using
the STTR mechanism (R41\/R42).&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, small businesses
interested in the development of relevant innovative technologies are
encouraged to apply via the SBIR mechanism (R43\/R44) with this
initiative.&amp;nbsp; Applicants are encouraged to contact NIH
Scientific\/Research staff for more detailed
guidance.&amp;nbsp;\nExamples of Potential Tools, Technologies, or
Products.&amp;nbsp; This initiative will support small business
development of research-enabling tools, technologies, or products such
as (but not limited to):\n\nWell-validated antibodies, affinity
reagents, or affinity-based assay kits for detection, quantitation, or
immunoprecipitation of modified RNAs, or enzymes that write, erase, or
bind to these modifications.\nSystems or kits that enable
high-throughput mapping of specific RNA modifications to residues in
individual RNA species using genome-wide sequencing
approaches.&amp;nbsp; For example, this could include RNA chemical
modification or targeting approaches analogous to the bisulfite
sequencing assays used for detecting methylcytosine or
hydroxymethylcytosine in DNA.&amp;nbsp;\nApproaches that enable
researchers to sequence RNA without a cDNA intermediate or that
otherwise preserve or amplify the RNA modification
information.&amp;nbsp; This could include the development or adaptation
of nanoscale sequencing devices or other equipment for direct
identification and quantitation of sequence-specific RNA
modifications.\nAssay systems or reagents that facilitate the discovery,
 detection or quantitation of modified RNAs, circular RNAs, edited RNAs,
 or RNA modification readers, writers, or erasers.&amp;nbsp;\nApproaches
 that exploit the ability of certain RNA modifications to disrupt
reverse transcription.\nProducts or systems that enable simultaneous
detection of many types of RNA modifications at high sensitivity.\nAssay
 systems or reagents that enable researchers to monitor the effect of an
 RNA modification on the structure or function of an individual
RNA.\nProducts that would enable the in vitro or in vivo imaging of
modified RNA molecules.\nThe development of analytical software tools to
 facilitate the identification of modified, circular, or edited RNA from
 high-throughput sequencing datasets.&amp;nbsp; This could include
algorithms that improve our ability to identify which base on a given
RNA is modified.&amp;nbsp;\nThe identification of small molecules that
act on RNA modification readers, writers, and erasers to facilitate
functional investigations.&amp;nbsp;\nThe development of constructs,
kits, or genetic resources that enable researchers to manipulate
modified RNAs to enable investigation into their biological or disease
functions.&amp;nbsp;\n\nSpecial Considerations\nHIV\/AIDS Counseling and
 Testing Policy for the National Institute on Drug Abuse:&amp;nbsp; In
light of recent significant advances in rapid testing for HIV and in
effective treatments for HIV, NIDA has revised its 2001 policy on HIV
counseling and testing.&amp;nbsp; NIDA-funded researchers are strongly
encouraged to provide and\/or refer research subjects to HIV risk
reduction education and education about the benefits of HIV treatment,
counseling and testing, referral to treatment, and other appropriate
interventions to prevent acquisition and transmission of HIV.&amp;nbsp;
This policy applies to all NIDA funded research conducted domestically
or internationally.&amp;nbsp; For more information see

 Advisory Council on Drug Abuse Recommended Guidelines for the
Administration of Drugs to Human Subjects:&amp;nbsp; The National
Advisory Council on Drug Abuse (NACDA) recognizes the importance of
research involving the administration of drugs with abuse potential, and
 dependence or addiction liability, to human
subjects.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Potential applicants are encouraged to
obtain and review these recommendations of Council before submitting an

National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse (NACDA) encourages NIDA and its
grantees to consider the points it has set forth with regard to existing
 or prospective sponsored research agreements with tobacco companies or
their related entities and the impact of acceptance of tobacco industry
funding on NIDA's credibility and reputation within the scientific

Early Diagnosis and Prognosis of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) (R43\/R44) ",
        "description": "Early identification of T1D risk and the onset
of autoimmunity provide the basis for a variety of major ongoing studies
 seeking to prevent or delay the disease.&amp;nbsp; Already, research on
 the natural history of the development of T1D in at-risk neonates has
shown that early identification of those at risk can foster early
diagnosis of T1D and avoid life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis
(DKA).&amp;nbsp; Also, clinical trials are currently in progress to
identify ways to prevent or reverse the autoimmunity of T1D.&amp;nbsp;
Investigators have used a combination of islet autoantibody positivity,
autoantibody seroconversion, biomarkers of genetic susceptibility, and
beta cell functional assays as criteria to select individuals at high
risk of developing T1D.&amp;nbsp; However, current technology for
identification of at-risk individuals is costly, requires participation
of research laboratories, and may not be suitable for public health
screening that would ensue should effective preventative interventions
be established.&amp;nbsp; Methods for more efficient identification of
individuals at risk of T1D who may be eligible for preventative
intervention would include low-cost, high-throughput, accurate and
predictive assays\/devices that could be used at the point of care
level.&amp;nbsp; Application of such technologies could facilitate and
expedite testing when effective ways to prevent or delay T1D become
available and would be essential for identifying individuals who can
benefit from such treatments.&amp;nbsp; Population-based screening of
individuals would be required, as the majority of people with newly
diagnosed T1D (~70-80%) have no affected relatives.&amp;nbsp; Thus, it
is necessary to promote and support novel developments in this field as
new biomarkers\/assays\/devices are needed to improve the identification
 of individuals at risk of developing T1D, determine prognosis, monitor
progression, and assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The
development of these technologies would facilitate recruitment for
clinical research focused on identifying environmental triggers of T1D,
T1D natural history, and interventions to prevent T1D.&amp;nbsp; It will
 also facilitate clinical implementation of measures subsequently proven
 effective in delaying or preventing T1D in those at risk.&amp;nbsp; Use
 of such assays in organ donors could also facilitate provision of
autoimmune pancreas to researchers.\nExamples of topics relevant to this
 announcement include but are not limited to:\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDevelopment
 of techniques or products useful for predicting, preventing or delaying
 progression of diabetes, including tests for identifying patients at
risk, and methods of monitoring disease progression.\nDevelopment of
high-throughput assays (reliable, accurate, cost-effective, highly
sensitive\/specific, standardized, having rapid turnaround time) for
autoantibody detection and other autoimmune\/inflammatory\/metabolic
markers for diagnosis and follow up.\nDevelopment of point-of-care
low-cost\/portable devices for subjects at risk for diabetes and for
diagnosis of diabetes.\nDevelopment of methods to measure changes in the
 immune status that may be used as markers to follow the
immune-modulatory activity and beneficial effect of agents tested in
clinical trials for the prevention and\/or treatment of
T1D.\nDevelopment of non-invasive imaging as well as other

Announcement (FOA) is to solicit Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) applications to undertake the development of biomarker panels for
 point-of-care assessment.&amp;nbsp; For the purpose of this FOA,
biomarkers include measureable biochemical characteristics associated
with the severity of acute sleep deprivation, chronic sleep deficiency,
or sleep disorders. The goal of biomarker panel development in this FOA
is the assessment of sleep-related risks to health (pathophysiology) or
safety. Development strategies that leverage existing data on the
chemistry of sleep and circadian biology would be highly desirable. For
instance, insufficient sleep or irregular sleep may be reflected in
existing data from immunological, metabolic, and hormonal markers of
pathophysiology.&amp;nbsp; Systematic modeling of the physiological
pathways regulated by sleep and circadian biology may lead to the
discovery of novel biomarker candidates. Recent advances in circadian
biology suggest that measurable characteristics of the daily rhythm in
genomic chemistry may lead to the identification of biomarker candidates
 in downstream physiological functions such as the regulation of
glucose.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tApplications should include a strategy to
evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of candidate biomarkers and
panels for selected applications such as aiding in the stratification of
 risks to safety or disease, estimating the impact of sleep problems on
quality of life, or evaluating efficacy of sleep disorder interventions.
 &amp;nbsp;Biomarker-based indices developed under this FOA must be
designed to outperform widely-used single variable assessments such as
self-reported sleep duration and psychomotor vigilance performance.
&amp;nbsp;Combinations of biomarkers selected from a larger pool of
candidates need to be validated with respect to accuracy and reliability
 of estimating the severity of the sleep problem and its prognostic
value for assessment of associated risks to health or safety. Examples
of biosamples considered practical for population-based studies and
point-of-care testing include, but are not limited to, easily accessible
 body fluids and tissues such as saliva, buccal mucosa, urine, and
blood. &amp;nbsp;Proposed biomarkers may include, but are not limited
to, molecules (protein\/lipid state, genes, gene products, metabolites
of external substances, etc.), cells, and measures of biological
function\/state that correlate with normative or pathophysiological
sleep health and symptoms of excessive &amp;ldquo;sleepiness.&amp;rdquo;
 &amp;nbsp;Biomarkers derived from monitoring brain electrical activity
may be employed as part of the development strategy leading to biomarker
 panels based on easily accessible body fluids and tissues.

 this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms
Regulation (ITAR), which controls the export and import of
defense-related material and services. Offerors must disclose any
proposed use of foreign nationals, their country of origin, and what
tasks each would accomplish in the statement of work in accordance with
section 5.4.c.(8) of the solicitation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: The
 objective of this topic is to develop fast charging rate and high
energy power systems for gunfired projectiles to survive high shock
survivability of launch acceleration to 70,000 g's, to have a military
shelf-life of 20 years, and survive flight vibrations to 10,000 cycles,
and storage temperatures from -55 degrees C to 125 degrees
C.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: This effort seeks proposals that
apply multidisciplinary approaches including integration of innovative
manufacturing methods, architectures and materials that demonstrates one
 or more Lithium-ion cells of size greater or equal to 0.5 Ah, scalable
to support a 24 volt or larger applications, that is abuse tolerant to
mechanical shock and vibration, operates in a wide range of thermal
conditions with excellent cyclic performance, provides high rate
performance compatibility, and low inherent materials and systems safety
 risks. Proposed power supply solutions for munition applications that
require High Power and Long Duration performance. One example, at a
voltage of 5 volts and a current of 0.13 amps, a power supply must last
at least 10 hours in a cylindrical volume of 1.3 inch by 1.3 inch. A
second application requires a power supply to provide current at a rate
of 2 amps for 10 hours while maintaining a voltage of no less than 4
volts as a worst case, the physical size of the phase II prototype must
be confined to the space occupied by 3 COTTS AA batteries.&amp;nbsp;In
all application cases conformability of the power source is an added
benefit to the applications, low cost and manufacturability are also of
great importance. Meeting military shelf-life with minimum degradation
as a function of the 20 year shelf-life is of great importance. Lithium
ion batteries are known to supply high power and high energy capability
and excellent storage capability on a weight to volume basis versus many
 available alternatives, offering promise for addressing power and
energy shortfalls and requirements of US Army ARDEC. Nonetheless,
criteria for ARDEC go beyond energy density where solutions are sought
for not only for weight and volume reduction, but also extended
operation time, high rate performance, and compatibility while operating
 in a wide range of ambient temperatures. Solutions also should be
compatible with rugged operating environments, support criteria for low
cost, high safety and reliability\/maintainability, and provide other
environmental compatibility. Moving lithium ion technology from the lab
into the field has proven that such batteries may lack the extended
cyclic performance, cycle life, and high rate compatibility when applied
 in demanding environments for armament and munitions systems.
Additionally, Lithium-ion solutions may involve undesirable failure
modes and risks that are not tolerant to military shock or operating
conditions. Even in non-military environments, for example, there have
been publicized risks of fires and explosions, recalling of laptop
computers and issues for deployed aviation systems. ARDEC requirements
for batteries can involve more demanding operating environments, need
for greater cyclic performance, higher rate performance compatibility,
and safety control in high mechanical shock environments including for
dismounted and other munitions systems. ARDEC systems also must satisfy
discharge and recharge in cold temperature environments and potentially
high rate performance such as for rapid recharging or discharging beyond
 civilian requirements. No single solution has come forward to date for
meeting these rigorous requirements, and it is anticipated that a
combination of multi-disciplinary approaches including new materials,
new architectures and new manufacturing methods would be needed are
needed to fulfill military requirements.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Conduct a
systematic study and subsequent design of a fast charging rate and high
energy power system that meet the desired high shock survivability,
military shelf life, and operational flight requirements and storage
temperatures. A multi-disciplinary approach including novel design,
engineering, materials selection and architecture qualification and the
production of qualification data and test plans to support Phase II.
These Phase I efforts will include all key required materials and design
 developments needed to produce one or more full Lithiumion cells of
size greater than 0.5 Ah in Phase II. Accordingly, Phase I will include a
 development\/selection of anode, cathode, electrolyte and physical
testing and qualification and selection for subsequent application in
Phase II that will be compatible with future scaling to a 24 volt or
larger application, capable of supporting a threshold of 5,000 cycles
and objective of 10,000 cycles based upon subsequent accelerated time
testing in Phase II, support and lead toward demonstration of discharge
cycling in Phase II of no less than 80% of initial capacity after 500
cycles, and compatible with demonstration of high rate operation and
recharging performance of at least 3C in Phase II.Most portable
batteries are rated at 1C, meaning that a 1,000mAh battery that is
discharged at 1C rate should under ideal conditions provide a current of
 1,000mA for one hour. The same battery discharging at 0.5C would
provide 500mA for two hours, and at 2C, the 1,000mAh battery would
deliver 2,000mA for 30 minutes. 1C is also known as a one-hour
discharge; a 0.5C is a two-hour, and a 2C is a half-hour discharge.The
qualification, selection and design also should be compatible with
enabling cold temperature cycling at -30F with favorable retention of
capacity in Phase II. This Phase I effort also will address
compatibility for abuse tolerance and deliver a final report that
includes a test plan for use in Phase II including performance testing,
high rate testing, and safety testing.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Will provide
four milestone deliverables (1) The delivery of one of more full Li-ion
cells of size greater than .5 Ah that are comprised of at least anode,
cathode, electrolyte and physical design, materials and architecture
selected in Phase I. (2) A concept design also will be provided to
assess the scaling to a 24 volt or larger application and the elements
of design for manufacturability. (3) A demonstration of high rate
operation with a recharging rate of at least 3C, consistent with test
plans developed in phase I. (4) The guidance and further documentation
and test plan developed in Phase I to assist the Army in testing with a
minimum of accelerated time testing that is indicative of supporting a
threshold goal of 5,000 cycles and objective of 10,000 cycles. Initial
qualification testing also may be undertaken to assess for retaining 80%
 of initial capacity after 500 cycles. A test framework also will be
included for testing for cold temperature cycling at or approaching -30F
 with favorable retention of capacity. In addition, abuse tolerance
testing may be undertaken for shock, nail testing and other methods to
test for fire and explosion risks.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III: This technology
would apply to weapon based platform applications. The commercial use
could apply to the electric vehicle industry and also for energy
recapture in industrial settings where renewable energy sources from
machinery could provide huge cost savings.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS:

Systems&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Develop a callable library of CFD numerical
operations that exploit the performance of CFD solvers on new \u201cmany
 integrated core\u201d processors such as the Intel\u00ae Xeon
PhiTM.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: Computer chip makers like Intel have
recently introduced the advanced Many-Integrated-Core (MIC) architecture
 [1] with the goal of enhancing performance for numerically intensive
calculations like satellite imaging and computer gaming. These new
processors offer an enormous increase in speed for these types of
calculations over the more traditional chips that support standard PC
applications. Recently, the DoD has began to upgrade their parallel High
 Performance Computer (HPC) systems to use these MIC processors because
they greatly enhance the degree of parallelism available for numerical
operations. Computational Fluid Dynaimic (CFD) codes used in Army
rotorcraft analysis [2] could greatly benefit from these performance
enhancements. Typical CFD runs today that require a week of compute time
 could be reduced to a day, making routine design iterations possible.
Exploiting this enhanced degree of parallelism requires new programming
strategies to exploit the vector processing units (VPUs) of the MIC
architecture. Traditional MPI-based programming strategies used in the
CFD codes today will not be effective [3]. CFD Codes are being developed
 in house and will be provided.This proposal solicits a library of
numerical operations performed by our CFD codes that achieve optimal
performance on the MIC architectures. The Army's CFD codes are
memory-bound, and the many-way parallelism offered by the MIC
architecture will not increase the degree of memory available on
today\u2019s processors. Hence, the proposed library should additionally
 include an analysis of the amount of memory used by the application.
Specific requirements for the library include:&amp;nbsp;\u2022 Numerical
 operations that achieve optimal performance on MIC architectures\u2022
Runtime memory analysis to determine when the problem size is too
large\u2022 Ability to be compiled with Army CFD codes under different

 run on MIC processors.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Expand the library to include
 the wider set of numerical operations encompassing the entire CFD code.

Demonstrate memory reporting and clean shutdown when memory limits are
exceeded. Demonstrate application of the library and performance gains
for to real-world rotorcraft CFD calculations.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL

computational structural dynamics (CSD), comprehensive analysis, and
other scientific computing applications of interest to the
Army.&amp;nbsp;COMMERCIALIZATION: The proposed library can be readily

Platform&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Develop coupling methodology for
computational structural dynamics (CSD) and computational fluid dynamics
 (CFD) models of flexible rotorcraft fuselage and empennage structures
to predict interactional buffet airloads, structural loads, and
vibration.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: One of the most important, challenging,
 and chronic problems occurring during development of new or upgraded
rotorcraft arises from the interactional aerodynamics of the complex,
unsteady flowfield of the rotor, hub, and fuselage that generate
significant adverse structural response of the flexible fuselage,
horizontal and vertical tails, and the tail rotor of conventional
helicopters. Similar problems arise for tilrotor and compound
rotorcraft. Historically this problem has been nearly intractable with
conventional aerodynamics and dynamics methodology, commonly leading to
unexpected problems only revealed during prototype flight testing. As a
consequence, expensive design changes, cut and try modifications, and
program delays often occur. Current highfidelity CFD\/CSD rotorcraft
modeling that aeroelastically couple rotor system CFD aerodynamics to
flexible blade CSD structural models is presently limited to 1-D elastic
 beam rotor blade and rigid fuselage models. Furthermore, existing
rotorcraft CSD\/CFD coupling interfaces do not encompass distributed CFD
 airloads coupling with flexible fuselage and empennage surfaces or
structural dynamics models of fuselage and empennage structures.
Therefore, a new general approach for a CFD\/CSD aeroelastic analysis to
 couple an elastic fuselage\/empennage with current CFD aerodynamics and
 flowfields is needed to improve overall fuselage\/empennage loads and
vibration predictions. Coupling should be applicable to full FEM
fuselage models as well as reduced-order modeling. In most cases CFD and
 CSD geometries and meshes are incompatible, and this must be
considered. Needed approaches must provide solutions that satisfy the
following requirements: 1) Must be rigorous, consistent and energy
conserving, 2) General and easily applied for arbitrary rotorcraft
configurations, 3) Message passing between CFD and CSD parallel
processing programs (file based I\/O may be used in Phase I), 4) Must be
 demonstrated on a practical real-world problem.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I:
Demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed fuselage CFD\/CSD coupling
approach by prototyping an elastic fuselage and developing initial

Materials\/Processes&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate an
additive manufacturing process for advanced aerospace gears meeting or
exceeding the mechanical properties of SAE AMS
6308.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: The lead time for manufacturing gears for
testing in Science and Technology (S&amp;amp;T) prototype demonstrators
can be several months and requires costly special tooling. Additive
manufacturing is a manufacturing technique that can be used to reduce
the lead time and cost for prototype hardware. Additive Manufacturing
(AM) refers to a process by which digital 3D design data is used to
build up a component in layers by depositing material. The goal for this
 topic is to develop a new or improved AM process for aerospace quality
gears in order for them to be used in prototype demonstrator
applications. Potential AM processes that could be improved upon
includes (but is not limited to) Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) and
 Electron Beam Melting (EBM). The AM process must be developed to
overcome existing challenges that limit the use of AM for gear
manufacturing. Some of the common challenges\/limitations
are:&amp;nbsp;Residual stresses can be high in AM parts, which limit the
 loading of parts. Stress mitigation and optimization strategies must be
 developed as part of the effort.Density of the material throughout AM
parts can be inconsistent. Density can be influenced by un-melted
entrapped powders. Overcoming this challenge needs to be addressed as
part of the effort.The rapid cooling rates associated with AM processes
can affect the microstructure of the base material resulting in
variations in desired strength, ductility, toughness, and modulus. The
new AM processes must mitigate the effects to material properties.Final
components manufactured using the developed process must meet or exceed
the mechanical properties of SAE AMS 6308 (Pyrowear 53). Pyrowear 53 may
 be considered as an Aerospace Grade 3 material, as defined in AGMA
926-C99. Any additional processing steps (such as hardening or surface
finishing) must be defined, and should be minimized if possible. A
method to vary the properties between the case and core regions of a
gear must also be addressed. Specific metrics for the final manufactured
 gears are:Minimum surface contact stress allowable = 250ksiMinimum
bending stress allowable = 40ksiMinimum core hardness = 34 HRCMinimum
case hardness = 60 HRCMinimum core yield strength = 140ksiMinimum core
ultimate tensile strength = 170ksiMaximum surface finish =

improved AM process for use in additive manufacturing. Efforts should
show that the formed parts can meet the properties equivalent to SAE AMS
 6308 steel by utilizing simple geometric shape test specimens that have
 been produced using additive manufacturing.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II:
Contractors are encouraged to collaborate with an Army rotorcraft OEM
during Phase II. The contractor shall further optimize the AM process
based on the Phase I results. This optimization shall include developing
 methods to reduce additional gear manufacturing processes (such as
carburization, peening, surface finishing) by altering the AM process.
Coupon level testing shall be performed to demonstrate mechanical
properties such as yield and ultimate tensile strength. Several sets of 4
 inch diameter spur gears (representative of aerospace quality gears)
shall be manufactured using the developed process. Testing and analysis
of these final gears shall be performed to demonstrate that each of the
topic metrics has been met. Additionally, the microstructure of the
final gears shall be analyzed and compared to Pyrowear
53.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Transition the new process

Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), which controls the export and import
of defense-related material and services. Offerors must disclose any
proposed use of foreign nationals, their country of origin, and what
tasks each would accomplish in the statement of work in accordance with

general-purpose matrix approach using domestic, commercially available
components, to provide matrix solutions for rocket motor structures
fabricated using filament winding, resin infusion\/transfer, and
pultrusion-winding operations.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: Next-generation
tactical propulsion systems require significantly more performance at
the material level to support extended duration and multi-mission
flexibility. In addition, the performance enhancements to current
systems are accompanied by the need for lower cost material and
processing technologies. Fiber reinforced polymer composites are
extremely advantageous for many weight-critical structural applications,
 such as solid rocket motor cases and missile airframes, due to their
high specific tensile strength and stiffness. In addition to weight
savings over metals, composite rocket motor cases also offer higher
operating pressures and improved Insensitive Munitions (IM)
performance.The many material-related benefits and advancements in
composite fabrication technologies have facilitated the integration of
composites into Army structures; however, many traditional matrix
systems that are currently in use were originally derived for strategic
and space-launch applications. These matrix systems, while well-suited
for larger structures produced at lower volumes, have seen widespread
use in the tactical propulsion community despite the fact that
production quantities and rates are higher and operational and
environmental requirements are more extreme. Furthermore, the focus on
low-cost solutions for higher volume tactical propulsion applications
has resulted in the move toward bonded end-fittings and other innovative
 joining techniques which impart interlaminar stresses within the
composite. When confronted with multiple stressors and the increasingly
severe demands of nextgeneration systems, traditional matrix systems
have struggled to meet the challenge in a cost-effective
manner.&amp;nbsp;Modern technology offers the opportunity to develop
matrix formulations that achieve a better balance between processing,
mechanical properties, and elevated temperature performance. Matrix
solutions to mitigate stress-related delamination failure in tactical
composite rocket motor cases and missile airframes are critical for the
development of low-cost, high performance structures that meet the
demands of next-generation systems.Matrix solutions with glass
transition temperatures above 400\u00b0F (and cure temperatures at or
below 370\u00b0F) are desired. Due to cost constraints for tactical
rocket motor case applications, solutions for this effort are limited to
 epoxy-based (single and multi-functionality) systems derived from
domestic, commercially available components. Resin unit costs for the
solution should not exceed that of commercially available 350\u00b0F
glass transition temperature filament winding epoxy resin systems, and a
 cost analysis of a material and process developments should be
included.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Offerors shall identify and investigate
material and processing solutions that provide good processing,
delivered fiber-direction tensile strength, and glass transition
performance along with enhanced shear and flat-wise tensile laminate
properties over state-of-the-art matrix systems. The material solution
should also exhibit enhancements to Mode I and Mode II fracture
toughness behavior. Material solutions should be processable using
traditional wet filament winding processes at resin bath temperatures of
 &amp;lt;110\u00b0F. Material solutions should be capable of producing
composite parts with fiber volume fractions of 60-65% and void contents
less than 1.5%. Capability for high throughput in typical production
environments must be considered (e.g., extended cure holds in excess of 6
 hours should be eliminated). Offerors shall conduct formulation
activities with strong consideration of potential material obsolescence
issues. Resin rheological analysis and laminate mechanical property
investigations shall be performed in order to substantiate the validity
of the proposed formulations for the application. Offerors should
develop methods to gain insight into fiber-matrix interaction with
commercial high-strength, intermediatemodulus carbon fibers produced
domestically within the United States. Offerors should include a cost
analysis of the material and process development.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II:
Offerors shall fabricate representative tactical rocket motorcase
structures utilizing down-selected formulation(s) from Phase 1 and
develop material allowables and supporting analysis for the intended
application. Offerors shall explore tailoring of the proposed baseline
matrix system for fabrication processes and applications and develop
property-performance relationships. Modifiers\/fillers to improve
mechanical properties such as compressive strength, adhesion, modulus
and glass transition will be investigated.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: Demonstrate the matrix system\u2019s performance in a
relevant environment. As this technology is pervasive, a Phase III
application for integration into Army missile systems would include
replacement of legacy matrix systems which are currently being used in
composite missile structures across the Capability Areas. Programs that
would benefit from this innovation are not limited to Army systems, but
extend throughout the Department of Defense and to the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. In addition to composite missile
structure applications, this technology could be utilized in commercial
applications in the private sector of the aerospace
industry.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: Fiber reinforced polymer composites, solid

methodology for producing low-cost, high-performance thermoplastic
composite structures that contain highly detailed features for missile
and aviation applications.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: Fiber reinforced
thermoplastic matrix composites (TPMCs) provide improved damage
tolerance, faster processing and assembly, reduced joint weight,
virtually unlimited shelf life with minimal storage requirements, and
recycling options which thermoset composites typically cannot offer.
Through automated processing, TPMCs allows the potential for mass
production of high stiffness\/strength thermoplastic composites at lower
 costs. Despite the above advantages, the true benefits of TPMC missile
structures have been limited by the constraints of available fabrication
 methods. For example, autoclave and compression molding techniques can
process continuous fiber preforms that offer high strength and stiffness
 but are generally more suited to producing fairly simple geometric
structures (e.g., plates, cones, box-structures). Injection molding
methods, on the other hand, offer the ability to produce highly complex
geometries, but even the most advanced molding compounds do not offer
the structural performance of continuous preforms.An ideal TPMC
structure would combine compression molded and injection molded
components into a single structure to retain cost and performance
benefits. This ideal TPMC fabrication process should have a minimum cost
 reduction of 20% from traditional autoclave and compression molding
manufacturing techniques. Joining techniques for TPMC components is an
area of active research but this is a secondary process that decreases
through-put and often requires access to the bond line for processing.
For structures that could benefit from attaching multiple injection
molded components to compression molded components, a direct method of
attachment is desired.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Develop a design and
fabrication strategy that combines multiple TPMC processing techniques
for producing a low-cost, high performance TPMC structure. Structural
properties should be a minimum of 50 Ksi tensile strength, 50 Ksi
compression strength and 7 Msi tensile and compression modulus. The
strategy should be able to accommodate producing structures as large as
1m x 1m, but contains detailed features, such as internal ribbing and
other traditional stiffening elements. Demonstrate the feasibility at
the coupon level to join TPMC components that have been produced by
multiple fabrication methods.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Refine the design and
fabrication strategy for producing more representative structures.
Perform comprehensive studies and analyses of the structure to determine
 optimal fabrication method for the individual subcomponents to balance
cost and performance. Perform mechanical tests to demonstrate
performance.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Upon successful
completion of the research and development in Phase I and Phase II,
produce prototype structures that can be demonstrated in field tests.
Scale-up the design and fabrication strategy to be compatible for low
rate and full production rate quantities. Demonstrate the TPMC structure
 can provide cost, weight, and performance benefits to applications
outside the military.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: thermoplastic matrix

 this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms
Regulation (ITAR), which controls the export and import of
defense-related material and services. Offerors must disclose any
proposed use of foreign nationals, their country of origin, and what
tasks each would accomplish in the statement of work in accordance with
section 5.4.c.(8) of the solicitation.&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Identify and
produce a low-cost material that matches or exceeds the performance of
depleted uranium (DU) in kinetic energy (KE) penetrator
applications.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: Beginning in the 1970s, depleted
uranium was selected as a replacement for tungsten alloys used in a
variety of armor-piercing projectiles. DU matches the density of
tungsten with the added benefit of \u201cselfsharpening\u201d through
adiabatic shear banding. DU penetrators also exhibit pyrophoric effects
as they impact a target and partially aerosolize, enhancing lethality
and improving anti-materiel efficacy. In addition to enhanced
performance, the manufacturability, low material cost, and abundant
supply of DU have made it a practical choice for KE penetrators.Limited
opposition to the use of DU exists in some circles based on the idea
that, as a heavy metal, depleted uranium deposited on the battlefield
might represent a serious persistent health or environmental hazard.
Because of this opposition, the Army has been exploring alternative
materials for KE penetrator applications.This SBIR topic requests a
fully dense KE penetrator material that matches or exceeds the ballistic
 performance of depleted uranium.The cost of the proposed material
should not exceed 200 percent of the cost of military grade tungsten
heavy alloy purchased in production quantities. The Army may consider
materials and processes that exceed this cost ceiling if they provide
exceptional KE penetrator performance or if they offset the material
cost through reductions in other life-cycle costs.The material proposed
should be less toxic than conventional tungsten nickel cobalt heavy
alloys.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: The offeror should use a multiscale materials
modeling approach, such as Integrated Computational Materials
Engineering (ICME), to develop material options to replace depleted
uranium in the kinetic energy penetrator application.The materials
developed shall meet or exceed the terminal ballistic performance of
current depleted uranium alloys. The result of the modeling effort shall
 be the complete description of the materials, including, but not
limited to, composition, crystal structure, phase identification,
preferred microstructural features, and expected mechanical and physical
 properties.The offeror shall demonstrate the synthesis and fabrication
of the most promising candidate material composition. The offeror will
deliver 12 identical samples of the material in kinetic energy
penetrator form (5.6 mm diameter and 16.7 mm in length).Create a
scale-up strategy for material production, and perform a cost analysis
describing the anticipated cost of fullscale production.&amp;nbsp;PHASE
II: The offeror shall build on the insight provided by the Phase I
materials modeling effort and the results of the Phase I ballistic
characterization to optimize the candidate composition. The offeror
shall scale up the synthesis and processing of the down-selected
material sufficiently to produce a single batch of material to fabricate
 25 identical penetrator rods (65g mass, 15:1 length to diameter ratio,
right circular cylinder, dimensional tolerances shall be provided).The
offeror shall perform ballistic characterization with these penetrators
against standard 3" rolled homogenous armor (RHA) at zero degrees
obliquity or similar tests, comparing these results against conventional
 tungsten penetrators.The offeror shall also fabricate from a single
batch of material an additional 25 identical copies of these penetrators
 for delivery to the Army for independent characterization. Tests should
 be structured to enable comparison with past DU test data.Further
optimize the composition and material properties based on Phase II
ballistic test results to meet launch survivability and terminal
ballistics requirements.Deliver 25 prototypes (half-inch diameter,
eight-inch length) to the Army for testing.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE

Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), which controls the export and import
of defense-related material and services. Offerors must disclose any
proposed use of foreign nationals, their country of origin, and what
tasks each would accomplish in the statement of work in accordance with
section 5.4.c.(8) of the solicitation.&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Design and
develop novel and innovative sensor technologies for stand-off detection
 and discrimination of surface and buried explosive
hazards.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: Sensor investments in counter explosive
threat technologies during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation
Iraqi Freedom have resulted in the solution of many niche problems but
provided few long-term solutions for sustaining operational tempo,
assured mobility and survivability. In order to address emerging and
evolving threats, novel and innovative technologies are required.
Capabilities from these technologies could lead to improved buried
in-road and surface side attack threat clearance as well as standoff
threat identification. This SBIR will seek development of novel and
innovative sensor technologies to detect and discriminate surface
and\/or buried explosive hazard targets. A successful proposal will
explain the phenomenology the sensor seeks to exploit and how that
phenomenology relates to either buried or surface explosive hazard
targets, such as discrimination between natural and man-made objects.
Proposals that provide sensor solutions relevant to either buried or
surface targets will be accepted, but sensors that are applicable to
both problem sets are preferred. Technology solutions, other than ground
 penetrating radar, are preferred. The proposed development activity
only needs to focus on a single phenomenology to be exploited, however
technologies that can show applicability to multiple Army problem sets
or multiple phenomenologies are preferred, such as disturbed earth,
threat and common clutter detection.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: The Phase I goal
is to demonstrate the proposed sensor technology, the phenomenology
being exploited and the utility of that phenomenology in detecting and
discriminating the targets of interest. The Phase I work can be
accomplished using modeling and simulation, but a data-driven experiment
 using actual hardware (bench-top or early prototype) is preferred. A
Phase I report is required.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: The Phase II goal is to
develop a prototype demonstration sensor. The prototype sensor should be
 capable of collecting data in a controlled setting. During Phase II,
the prototype sensor will be used to demonstrate the utility of the
sensor and phenomenology being exploited. The Phase II final report must
 include a description of the developed sensor, a study validating the
sensor and the phenomenology being exploited, problems discovered with
the sensor\/phenomenology, and recommendations for future sensor
improvements.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Mature the
sensor such that it can be fielded by the military or sold commercially
for homeland security applications. This includes improvements described
 in the Phase II report. Develop Aided Target Recognition (AiTR)
algorithms to detect and discriminate targets of interest. The resulting
 sensor could then be fielded for use in detecting buried or roadside
hazards during military operations or for detecting buried or roadside
hazards or other concealed structures of interest by city planners and
utility\/highway inspectors.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: counter explosive

Explosive Hazard Detection",

technology within this topic is restricted under the International
Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), which controls the export and import
of defense-related material and services. Offerors must disclose any
proposed use of foreign nationals, their country of origin, and what
tasks each would accomplish in the statement of work in accordance with
section 5.4.c.(8) of the solicitation.&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Design and
develop a multi-static Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) system that is
capable of detecting buried explosive hazards from a standoff
distance.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: Current standoff GPR systems operate in a
 mode that is essentially equivalent to monostatic. The transmit and
receive antennas are located close to each other so the phenomenology of
 target and clutter responses are as if the same antenna was used for
transmit and receive. This modality has shown to have some capability to
 detect buried explosive hazards at standoff, but the detection
performance has not reached that of close-in systems. There is a desire
to detect targets from a distance, and investigations are underway using
 additional modalities to improve performance. One possible way to do
this is to try and increase the signal level received from targets. In
most standoff GPR systems, the antennas are positioned with a relatively
 low grazing angle relative to the target, limiting the energy that can
penetrate into the ground. Having antennas at different positions
and\/or orientations may help improve the signal level received from the
 target versus what is received from clutter. Another advantage that
close-in, downward looking GPR systems have relative to standoff systems
 is that they have good 3-Dimensional resolution that allows them to
separate the response from the surface from objects buried beneath it.
Standoff systems typically only have resolution in 2 dimensions which
causes the responses of targets and the ground to be combined. Novel
multi-static orientations may allow for better resolution in 3
dimensions. The objective of this effort is to investigate and design a
fully bi-static or multi-static GPR system to better learn about the
phenomenology of the responses from targets and clutter and to find ways
 to better discriminate between the two. The desired system could
consist of a ground vehicle, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), or a
combination of the two. A ground vehicle would need to operate at ranges
 of at least 15 meters from targets. Ground penetration of at least 15
cm and sufficient resolution are required. The system should be capable
of detecting 80% of buried targets with a False Alarm Rate of 10 per
linear km of road. The system may utilize any active transmitters
inherent to itself, transmitters present in the ambient environment, or
some combination of the two. Other sensing modalities could be used to
extract higher resolution range information to enhance further
processing&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: The goal of Phase I is to create
multi-static radar design and supporting quantitative analysis with the
objective of detecting buried explosive threats in cluttered
environments. The offeror should model spatial antenna configurations
for optimized signal to clutter performance. Simple lab experiments may
be used to support the model as related to electromagnetic response
strength of targets, soil, and clutter. The deliverable of Phase I will
be a report that includes the results of the phenomenology study and a
preliminary-design for proof-of-concept equipment.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II:
The design created in Phase I will be expanded and used to produce a
field setup (TRL 5). The equipment will be used to verify parameters of
the model that affect detection performance. The phenomenology of the
targets and clutter will be validated to support the proposed detection
configuration. The deliverable will include an expanded model comparing
detection performance for multiple configurations. Also deliverable are
field equipment, data, and data analysis supporting the principle
assumptions of the model and illustrating detection improvements over
monostatic configurations.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The
 hardware design will be further refined and a technology demonstrator
will be constructed for field use. The system developed under this
effort will have high potential for other commercial applications for
underground surveying and humanitarian demining, and other homeland
security agencies.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: Ground Penetrating Radar, Unmanned

Client Support for Tactical Systems",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Information SystemsThe
technology within this topic is restricted under the International
Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), which controls the export and import
of defense-related material and services. Offerors must disclose any
proposed use of foreign nationals, their country of origin, and what
tasks each would accomplish in the statement of work in accordance with
section 5.4.c.(8) of the solicitation.&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Develop a
patch management system capable of providing automated and continuous
Information Assurance (IA) patches for fielded, tactical systems, while
providing a remote capability for auditing and assessing system
vulnerability.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: In accordance with the Army Cyber
Command Operations Order (OPORD) 2011-051, vulnerabilities are
exploitable weakness in software that provide an adversary with an
opportunity to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and\/or
availability of an Information System (IS). These vulnerabilities are
being actively exploited in DoD networks and pose a high risk to Army
IS. Consequently, units are being required to expedite efforts to
mitigate risks posed by vulnerabilities.The current operational tempo is
 such that, IAVAs are network accessible via AKO, on a monthly basis for
 connected systems. IAVAs are replicated and distributed via CD\/DVD on a
 quarterly basis for systems without network connectivity. In an effort
to meet army demands for increased timeliness of IAVA releases, the Army
 will be required to release IAVAs at an accelerated rate for each
system\u2019s state of connectivity.Historically frequent updates
typically require additional resources in terms of engineering
(test-fix-test) cycle. This would also effectively increase utilization
of additional resources such as replication, installation and
distribution services and therefore lifecycle cost. Continuous updates
will also increase impacted Field Support Engineers (FSEs), requiring
them to install software on a frequent basis for the units in the
field.Current sustainment efforts include an initial scan of the system
for identification of IA vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are
collected over a period of time, mitigated and finally tested. If items
do not successfully pass, they must be documented in the Plan of Action
&amp;amp; Milestones (POA&amp;amp;M) and mitigated at a later date. Once
 the system has successfully passed all testing (or POA&amp;amp;M is
updated accordingly) all IAVA fixes are packaged into a software release
 and fielded. While the system is in the field, there is potential that
new threats will be identified that leave the system in a vulnerable
state. As a result, a patch must again be applied, tested and delivered,
 no later than 72 hours after notification.When a physical release of
IAVA updates occur, especially on a monthly basis for instance, software
 sustainment costs increase drastically. Systems must be validated and
verified; POAM are required to be updated; test reports must be
prepared, software must be shipped more frequently and Field Service
Engineering support increases. When occurring at an accelerated rate and
 deviating from the standard quarterly IAVA release, the demand on
available resources also increases.The below are metrics which estimates
 cost of monthly IAVMs for a single baseline over a 12 month
period:Gather IA threats and collect at least monthly; scan, mitigate,
test, and deliver an IAVM update monthly; update&amp;nbsp;POAM monthly:
$600KDevelop, test and deliver an emergency IAVM update as required with
 delivery no longer than 72 hours after&amp;nbsp;notification (two per
month): $750KConduct validation and verification scans of the monthly
update; prepare and deliver \u201cResults\u201d report: $300KVendor CM,
QA, delivery, printing, material, shipping $300KSEC CM and Release:
$30KRDIT distribution of Monthly Releases to FSRs; electronic
distribution of Emergency Releases to units: $30KField Service Engineer
install and validate installation $3500KTotal Cost: $5510KDevelopment of
 a technical solution which ensures that IAVAs are released on a
continuous basis is required, with the capability to identify potential
threats and conduct vulnerability assessments in near real-time. The
solution should also be capable of providing a complete view of
vulnerability and exploit risks, based on threat insights. Frequent IAVA
 updates to software will be required to mitigate issues and protect
Army tactical systems while reducing software sustainment cost.Supported
 software resides on multiple domains ranging from unclassified through
TS\/SCI. There is a need to keep IAVA mitigation at the lowest
classification possible to allow for ease of access by system
administrators (FSEs &amp;amp; 35Ts) and replication if required.
Currently monthly IAVAs are posted to AKO-S, which presents a challenge
for disconnected systems which reside on other domains or systems on
closed networks that need the updates prior to the distribution on
CD\/DVD.A network-only solution will require an instantiation on every
possible domain and there will still be a need to remediate systems that
 require reloading or have been disconnected from a network for a period
 of time. The connection must create secure electronic software
distribution for issue mitigation. The network solution will also be
required to possess a secure software tool which allows for remote
access across each domain. The intent of the tool is to assist units
with quickly resolving technical issues which may arise while updating
software. This will assist with reducing FSE manpower while enhancing
the user experience for the Warfighter.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Develop a
concept which documents a process for developing a patch management
system capable of providing automated and continuous Information
Assurance (IA) patches for fielded, tactical systems, while providing a
remote capability for auditing and assessing system
vulnerability.Provide a detailed design of a solution that provide the
capability to identify potential threats and conduct vulnerability
assessments in near real-time and mitigate IAVA issues. The solution
also shall provide remote IAVA updates to software to Army tactical
systems while reducing software sustainment cost. Complete a system
design concept and demonstrate through modeling, analysis, or prototype
that it meets the requirements. A requirements analysis report and a
design study document shall be part of the final report. The final
report shall also include estimated cost for development of the
capability.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Develop a working prototype augmented
reality capability of IAVA Management system for use with Tactical
System that is based on the selected Phase I design.Interface the
capability to the Army\u2019s network through the use of a tactical
system. Perform evaluation tests of the capability using simulated
mission scenarios and validates that the approach identify, mitigate
issues and remotely update IAVA patches to Tactical Systems. In addition
 to delivering the prototype augmented reality capability, a report
shall be submitted detailing testing and demonstration results. This
report shall identify key performance parameters related to how the
augmented reality to mitigate issues and protect Army tactical systems
while reducing software sustainment cost.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: Implement solution as part of a tactical system and deploy
 the system for test and evaluation using commercially available
technologies. The implementation should ensure that the system is
interoperable with existing system of systems. Perform steps required to
 commercialize the system. In conjunction with Army, optimize the
prototype created in Phase II. The technology developed should result in
 a capability that can be used by the Warfighter.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS:

and Neutron from Nuclear Blast",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Nuclear
Technology&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Develop a real-time detector capable of
accurately measuring the dose from prompt gamma and prompt neutron from a
 nuclear blast.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: The Defense community has a need
for detecting and measuring the prompt gamma and prompt neutron from a
nuclear blast. When a nuclear weapon detonates, it creates both prompt
(also called initial) and residual radiation. Prompt neutrons result
almost exclusively from the energy producing fission and fusion
reactions, while prompt gamma radiation includes that arising from these
 reactions as well as that resulting from the decay of short-lived
fission products (Ref. 1, FM 8-9). For small tactical nuclear weapons
(under 50 kT), the prompt radiation is one the most predominate causes
of casualties, more than the blast wave and thermal (Ref. 1, FM 8-9
table 3-I).The prompt radiation occurs in a very short pulse, lasting
only a few microseconds. Thus it is exceedingly hard to accurately
measure real-time. Currently, the warfighters have both passive
dosimeters and real-time dosimeters. Passive dosimeters such as as film
badges, Thermo luminescent Dosimeters (TLDs), or Optically Stimulated
Luminescence (OSL) detectors accurately measure the prompt radiation.
The Army\u2019s PDR-75A uses OSL technology and can accurately measure
the prompt radiation. However, it is not a real-time system. The
warfighter must stop what they are doing and read the dosimeter in a
reader to determine their dose. The current real-time dosimeters such as
 the UDR-13 can provide real-time measurements, but are extremely
inaccurate (sensitivity around 30 cGy). The warfighters currently do not
 have capability to accurately measure prompt radiation accurately in
real-time.There are several technologies that have been developed or
advanced in the last few years that make real-time measurement of prompt
 doses possible, feasible, and affordable. Recent advances in OSL
devices along with advances in optic sources and measurement devices may
 allow the development of a device that can accurately measure prompt
gamma and neutron in real-time or near real-time. There have also been
advances in MOSFET and Pin-diodes that may allow the use of those
technologies for the needed measurements. The goal of this research
would be the development of such an innovative detector for eventual use
 on radiation detectors for vehicles and personal.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I:
Demonstrate the proposed technology can accurately measure the prompt
gamma and prompt neutron doses in real-time (or near real-time) via
breadboard validation in laboratory environment (TRL 4). The initial
step is to design and fabricate a breadboard prototype using the
proposed technology. The next step is to test the breadboard prototype
against prompt gamma and prompt neutron environment (i.e. the pulse
reactor at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR)) to assess the capability of
 proposed technologies to meet the need. The final step is to review and
 analyze the data to determine the feasibility of the proposed
technology to fulfill the Army\u2019s need to accurately measure the
prompt gamma and prompt neutron doses in real-time.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II:
In Phase II, demonstrate the proposed technology can accurately measure
the prompt gamma and prompt neutron doses in real-time (or near
real-time) through high-fidelity breadboard validation in a relevant
environment (TRL 5 or greater). Design and fabricate a high-fidelity
breadboard prototype apparatus with the proposed technology integrated
with reasonably realistic supporting elements. Test the breadboard
prototype apparatus in a relevant environment to include prompt gamma
and prompt neutron as well as other relevant challenges such as
temperature, EMP, and vibration. The purpose of testing is to ensure the
 ability of the technology demonstrates the needed capability to
accurately measure the dose from prompt gamma and prompt neutron in
real-time, but also to determine if any potential limitations of the
technology prevent the eventual fielding of the technology. The final
step is to review and analyze the data to determine if the technology
will fulfill the Army\u2019s need to accurately measure prompt gamma and
 prompt neutron doses in real-time in a relevant
environment.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: If Phase II is
successful, Phase III will further refine a final deployable design,
incorporating design modifications based on results from tests conducted
 during Phase II, and improving engineering\/form-factors, equipment
hardening, and manufacturability designs to meet U.S. Army CONOPS and
end-user requirements.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: nuclear radiation detection,

Applications",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Chemical\/Biological
Defense&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Leverage phage-based technologies to develop
 fieldable assays and demonstrate the long-term stability of these
assays.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: Technologies that enable biological
detection and presumptive identification with low operational burden are
 needed as future Warfighter capabilities. Lateral flow immunoassays
(LFIs) have remained the go-to technology for approximately 20 years
despite a plethora of lab-based techniques that vastly outstrip LFIs in
critical qualities such as sensitivity and specificity. This persistence
 of LFIs demonstrates the overwhelming importance of ease of use and low
 operational burden to technology adoption. While huge investments in
pushing lab-based techniques towards ruggedization and simple operation
are resulting in advances, platform technologies that start from a
position of low operational burden and expand capabilities beyond LFIs
are attractive. Meanwhile, interest in phage for a range of applications
 has significantly increased in recent years. Department of Defense
(DoD)-relevant applications include bacterial detection, identification,
 decontamination, and treatment, especially of antimicrobial resistant
strains. Phage offers high host specificity, built-in replication,
abundance in nature, and ease of production, amongst other properties.
Indeed, modified phages have been demonstrated in the lab as a highly
sensitive and specific method to detect biological warfare agents such
as Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis. Research into the stability
of phage after lyophilization spanning several decades has shown mixed
results for different phage and for different preparation methods; yet,
significant success suggests that phage could present an excellent
approach to fielded biological detection. This topic seeks innovative
development of phage-based detection and identification technologies
that are highly fieldable. More specifically, ideal assays would be
simple to operate, inexpensive, disposable, and require little or no
equipment to analyze results; however, they must also continue to
enhance the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Determining the
technical merit of using phage as the main component of fieldable
assays, by determining a method for stabilization, would help drive
forward the current metrics for detection and identification. While an
LFI format is not specifically requested, proposed approaches should use
 the success of this format as a template; especially the ability to
demonstrate operability in austere environments is highly
encouraged.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Proof-of-concept will require the
production of at least one specific assay that incorporates the use of a
 stable phage as a main component of the final design. This assay should
 address the ability to operate in austere environments, while
continuing to be simple to operate, inexpensive (ie. less than
$100\/test, with a clear path towards cost reduction), disposable, and
require little or no equipment to analyze results. For demonstration
purposes in Phase I, detection limits are not as essential as stability
of the assay components.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: The offeror will develop
functioning assays with improved limits of detection for more than one
target of specific interest to the DoD. Detection of actual threat
agents is encouraged but not necessarily required. However,
demonstration of enhanced stability capabilities above what was
demonstrated in Phase I, such as resistance to environmental
fluctuations (ie. storage temperatures up to 30\u00baC, with up to
50\u00baC being optimal, and operational temperatures robust up to a
5\u00baC variation from ideal conditions set by the offeror) regardless
of the target is also expected. At the conclusion of Phase II, the
assays developed should be able to be tested for both reproducibility
and accuracy of results at several storage and operational temperatures.
 Furthermore, suitable testing partners should be identified for threat
agent testing, as work with many specific agents is highly
restricted.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Efforts in both
Phase II and Phase III should be clearly directed towards transition to
field use. Potential limitations in sample preparation requirements,
sensitivity, robustness, etc. should be clearly indicated. Avenues to
overcome these limitations in potential Phase III work should be
outlined. Potential products using the same technology that are not
specific to DoD needs may involve different limitations (e.g. robustness
 to austere operations), and these separate limitations should also be
outlined. Inexpensive, disposable, ruggedized detection of biological
threat materials or other targets have several uses outside the DoD.
Most obviously, detection of a much wider range of threats would useful
in hospital or remote clinic settings. Other applications include
detection of biological targets for industrial or personal use (e.g.,
food safety, pathogen detection, etc.)&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: synthetic

to end system to exploit current and future commercial satellite imaging
 systems by utilizing novel techniques and algorithms to fuse the
different data packages together to detect changes and provide
warning\/cueing to other systems.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: The commercial
industry is paving the way for new end to end low earth orbit satellite
systems capable of providing near-continuous (revisit times of minutes
to hours) imaging of the Earth. Some exemplars of these developments are
 Google\u2019s SkyBox, PlanetLabs, BlackSky, Spire and Satellogic.
Within the next few years, these companies are expected to field their
own proprietary constellations, each with their own set of capabilities
and products, which will be made available to the average consumer,
commercial resellers, corporate and government users. These
constellations hold a significant interest for the USAF as they are
capable of high revisit rates at pertinent resolutions, between 1-5m.
The USAF would like to capitalize on these future systems by building an
 infrastructure capable of exploiting the products and capabilities of
these systems by integrating them into strategic analysis for areas of
interest on a global scale. Many of these companies will host their
images on their databases anywhere from hours to days after the photos
are taken. In addition some systems will allow for consumers to
\u2018task\u2019 satellites to take pictures of certain areas for a
minimal cost.As many of the companies will be collecting images with
differing resolutions and wavebands, from different angles, times of day
 and over slightly different regions, the data will have to be collected
 and fused in order to correlate changes in a given area. An important
element of this fusion is the registration of images, and in some cases
ortho-rectification and geo-registration across these data sets. Next,
the USAF needs to determine, autonomously, when significant changes
occur in any given region. This poses significant challenges, as angles,
 shadows, and potentially a lack of geolocation may inhibit systems from
 properly alerting personnel of new areas of interest or changes in
specific regions being monitored. The criteria for a useful tip\/cue
includes the time from data collection to receipt of the imagery,
geolocation accuracy, probability of false alarm, and characterization
of the activity or target of interest (i.e. troop buildup, missile
launch preparations, etc). The system needs to provide proper warnings
and indicators to the Air Force if an area becomes significant enough to
 require more persistent monitoring. The ability of the USAF to task
these constellations must also be considered if it can provide
additional value, in which case the processes for allocating these
resources and efficiently tasking the constellations must be developed.
This effort will receive no more than $1.5M for this
award.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Proposal must show:Demonstrated understanding

Please direct questions to the AF SBIR\/STTR Contracting Officer, Ms.
Gail Nyikon, gail.nyikon@us.af.mil.&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Build and
demonstrate a handheld navigation system that is less than 5 lbs,
capable of constraining position error growth, and reports estimated
position accuracy in GPS-challenged environments.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION:
Accuracy, reliability, persistence, and integrity of Position Navigation
 and Timing (PNT) information from GPS and other Global Navigation
Satellite Systems (GNSS) is under constant threat from asymmetrical
jamming and spoofing attacks, rendering operations in
anti-access\/area-denial (A2AD) or \u201ccontested\u201d environments
increasingly difficult. A surge of R&amp;amp;D initiatives has given
scientists and engineers a variety of tools and techniques that can be
used to increase the resiliency of our navigation systems. These
include, but are not limited to: GPS anti-Jam\/anti-Spoof mechanisms;
augmentations with GNSS, exploitation of signals of opportunity (SoOP)
such as telecommunication towers or eLoran; vision aided navigation;
advancements in MEMS-based navigation sensors; and many more. Navigation
 system concepts which are designed for GPS-\u201cchallenged\u201d
environments often have to compromise between performance, robustness,
and SWaP-C (Size, Weight, Power and Cost). This topic seeks to leverage
the aforementioned innovations as well as other novel ideas to design,
build, and field a man-portable navigation system to be used by
ground-based forces to navigate to a target in a GPS-contested
environment.The following vignette depicts the robustness and
performance required. A tactical vehicle navigates to a drop-off point.
Military forces dismount and approach a target of interest on foot,
traversing several kilometers over many (up to 12) hours on batteries.
The operation occurs in day or darkness, in inclement weather, and in
environments with little or no infrastructure such as remote deserts and
 forests. When GPS and other GNSS are available they can be used. When
GPS is degraded or denied, other RF SoOP and landmark-based navigation
updates (e.g. vision, magnetic, etc.) should be used to constrain
position error growth. Initialization will be at a known location or
with GPS.Throughout the mission, it is desired that the accuracy
performance of the navigation solution should be as good as possible
with the objective of constraining position errors to less than 100 m.
Currently, this level of performance is unfeasible with unaided
MEMS-based inertial navigation systems, and while it is anticipated the
accuracy will vary throughout the mission depending on the aiding source
 used, it is critical that valid position accuracy estimates are
provided throughout the mission.Use of aiding to constrain the
navigation system error growth is anticipated, and this aiding can
include, but is not limited to: vision, radar, RF SoOPs,
magnetometer-based landmarks, ranging radios, etc. As the forces will be
 traveling in a group, a collaborative, a multi-user networked
architecture could be considered.The navigation system can integrate
with existing radios and battlespace awareness applications currently
used by US military forces. It must be a handheld unit similar in size
to a smartphone or tablet with any extra hardware, such as antennas or
complimentary sensors, being as few and miniaturized\/non-cumbersome as
possible. The total weight (including batteries) must not exceed 5 lbs,
and ideally is 1 lb or less. The troops must have location, location
accuracy, and navigation information constantly updated on their
handheld devices (or provided to existing display devices in the
appropriate format) after they have dismounted from the vehicle.This
effort will receive no more than $1.5M for this
award.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Contractor will have developed a
navigation system design, software architecture, and provided test
reports showing system performance using real data (with simulated GPS
outages\/jamming), and a plan for miniaturizing the system to a handheld
 form factor\/providing a real-time navigation
solution.&amp;nbsp;FEASIBILITY DOCUMENTATION: Offerors interested in

 DP2 proposal where it determines that the offeror has failed to

navigation system that operates for 8 hrs on batteries, weighs less than
 5 lbs, outputs standard NMEA, and displays position and position
accuracy when used by dismounted military forces operating in a
GPS-challenged environment. Accuracy of the system will be dependent on
environment, the estimate of the accuracy must be provided to the user.
The system must include additional methods to constrain position error
growth when GPS is not available.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE

gail.nyikon@us.af.mil.&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate a
capability to manufacture and qualify non-flight critical aircraft
parts&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: Additive manufacturing and new rapid
manufacturing methods may have the capability to reduce the cost and the
 lead time required to produce and maintain many kinds of parts for the
aerospace industry. One hurdle in implementing these new manufacturing
methods for replacement parts is the stringent, time consuming and
costly qualification processes that must be followed because of the
change in manufacturing process, especially for flight-critical parts.
There are likely legacy parts within the Air Force supply chain that are
 excellent candidates for production by these new manufacturing methods,
 and that also have less stringent qualification requirements because
they are non-flight critical.Lead time sometimes restricts the supply
chain for servicing Air Force aircraft. Oftentimes, parts that need to
be manufactured have long-lead times for procurement or the supplier is
no longer in the business of making the parts. The ability to
organically produce non-critical parts has the potential to transform
Air Force sustainment practices. This effort is primarily geared towards
 replacing non-critical parts with additive manufacturing methods. These
 parts include but are not limited to such items as brackets, ducting,
housings, shrouds (such as the KC-135 refueling shroud), covers, and
hoses. This list is not designed to be all inclusive, but provides some
of the known opportunities for parts replacement. In general, metallic
parts that have any fatigue requirements are too high risk to pursue for
 this effort, but other high value parts may be good options if the part
 requirements and capability of the manufacturing process are well
understood.The capability to certify the process for non-critical parts
and certifying the process for a family\/class of parts is needed more
than point certification for parts. Successful proposals must identify
potential parts and demonstrate an understanding of how to identify all
part requirements (i.e., to reverse engineer the requirements) to ensure
 success of replacement efforts. All business cases for developing new
manufacturing methods must consider qualification as an important step
of replacing the part. Cost and lead time of the part families must be
considered from the outset in order to build an appropriate business
case for future parts.Because this effort is geared towards parts
replacement, successful proposals will be expected to demonstrate a
capability to not only manufacture parts, but also the ability to
develop the data and engineering analysis required for qualification of
the part. Sign-off from the appropriate engineering authority will be
required before new manufacturing methods can be implemented onto actual
 parts. Projects are more likely to be successful if OEM engineering
authorities are brought into advisement. Because of the wide scope of
Air Force parts, successful proposals will identify parts to pilot the
new manufacturing methods on. Partnering with OEM\u2019s or other
suppliers to propose efforts with already identified potential parts
will likely be more successful than relying on the Air Force to identify
 a prioritized list of parts to manufacture.Proposals are limited to
$900K.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Contractor will have developed and demonstrated

of non-flight critical aircraft parts. Developed plans and techniques

deliver a capability that includes necessary materials, machines, and
processes to produce masking and tooling for thermal spray, shot
peening, and other coating processes to support sustainment of aircraft
turbine engines.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: Additive manufacturing and new
rapid manufacturing methods may have the capability to transform the
cost and the lead time required to produce and maintain many kinds of
parts for the aerospace industry. Tooling, fixtures, shop aids, and
prototypes are low-risk applications for additive manufacturing to
assist the depot maintenance of aircraft. Other DoD facilities such as
the NAVAIR\u2019s Fleet Readiness Centers have utilized additive
manufacturing to assist in the repair of aircraft to decrease cost and
time associated with non-flying parts. Plasma spray, shot peening, flame
 spray, and other similar processes are typically used in the
sustainment of aircraft engines by the 76th Propulsion Maintenance Group
 (PMXG) at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center. Masking is required
to protect some surfaces of parts during these processes, requiring
manually intensive mask taping or expensive, long lead custom masks made
 from RTV or similar materials that have a limited shelf life. Additive
manufacturing has the potential to transform the cost and lead time to
mask these parts, transforming the process that is required in preparing
 parts for the deposition or peening processes.The desired outcome of
this program is a delivered machine, material system, and process that
can be used to cost and time effectively produce reusable masks for
thermal spray. The materials used for the mask need to withstand the
thermal environment that is expected during thermal spray processes. The
 masks must sufficiently protect the unsprayed area to result in a
quality coating. The end state is to lower the time required to produce a
 mask, so a rough comparative analysis must be undertaken to compare
traditional masking techniques to the proposed technique.Potential
solutions could be the direct manufacture of masks via a 3D printer or
the use of a 3D printer to produce a mold for these masks. Close
interaction with AFRL and PMXG is expected to ensure technical
requirements are met. Commercialization potential for this process
exists for all thermal spray masking applications. PMXG currently is
acquiring a production scale FDM machine that is capable of producing
parts over 1ft x 1ft x 1ft. It would be advantageous if the technical
solution was compatible with the already existing equipment, however, it
 is not a requirement of this program. Other types of machines can be
considered for use in the end technical solution.Material requirements
for produced masks include ability to conform to the part being sprayed
(roots of blades, cases, knife edge seals, stators, etc.) within
tolerance to create a clean masking line. Temperatures of the material
are expected to see temperatures in excess of 400 degrees F and must be
able to handle or resist the heat of the sprayed particles and flame. UV
 degradation of the materials must also be considered due to the UV
emissions of the plasma spray.Proposed projects should include research
and development of processes to produce masks and demonstrations to
assist in the sustainment of Air Force parts.Proposals are limited to
$900K.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Contractor will have piloted a capability to
produce plasma spray masking directly via additive manufacturing.

Systems&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Design an open, modular framework for a
missile defense planner such that a training system can be embedded in
it, allowing for underlying components to be rapidly inserted (e.g.
mapping engines and visualization tools).&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: The goal
 of this topic is to investigate and demonstrate the feasibility and
utility of building an integrated command and control (C2) planning and
training system. While this effort is intended to focus on missile
defense (C2), the system must be designed and developed with the intent
of expanding to address integrated air and missile defense.Typically,
battle management planners and training systems are separate products;
however, both have sub-systems that perform nearly identical functions,
to include modeling of current threats and blue force capabilities,
visualization and mapping, scenario generation, and scenario execution
with record-and-playback capabilities. The unique capabilities for a
missile defense battle management planner include defense-design
creation and effectiveness analysis while distinctive training system
capabilities include truth and instructor displays, red cell controls
(during scenario execution), and white cell controls (e.g. script or
change blue force failures, degraded performance, and shot doctrine).
However, even these unique planner and trainer capabilities would add
value to each other in an integrated system.The desire is for an open,
modular, flexible, and adaptable missile defense planner which abstracts
 the component functionality (including the visualization and mapping
engine processes) to facilitate rapid insertion of higher fidelity or
quality services. This framework should include a training path which
allows for the current planner (at any release) to be used for training
and must be consistent with the underlying integrated missile defense
planner. It should accommodate new plug-ins for blue force lay downs and
 red force threats. The framework should also safely separate training
from real-time access.This effort should incorporate innovative methods
of product architectural design in order to facilitate the latest data
sharing methodologies. This topic is not soliciting visualization.
Mapping engines\/products already exist and are not a part of this
effort.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Develop and demonstrate a missile defense
planner architectural framework that allows dynamic instantiation of
system components and or capabilities, as well as providing simple
low-bandwidth methods of data sharing between processes. Demonstrate how
 this architecture could be used to simplify the evolution of missile
defense product development life cycles while not restricting future
enhancements.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Refine and update concept(s) based on

evaluation in realistic scenarios. Transition technologies developed

of defense-related material and services. Offerors must disclose any
proposed use of foreign nationals, their country of origin, and what
tasks each would accomplish in the statement of work in accordance with
section 5.4.c.(8) of the solicitation.&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Develop
approaches and technologies that enable irrefutable and unalterable
logging and maintaining of tamper events of commercial off-the-shelf
(COTS)-based critical technology solutions without utilization of
write-once memory.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: The proposed research and
development project will provide a way to increase confidence levels to
determine whether the detected event, in fact, was an infiltration. The
application is for systems that do not have write-once memory and its
processing capabilities. This irrefutable evidence should not compromise
 the systems functionality. This topic is not seeking solutions that use
 tamper-evident labels or security seals. Though the particular solution
 may be tailored for individual applications, the concept and
methodology of the solution should be applicable to various COTS and
military hardware. Preferred solutions should work without introducing
additional performance risks or costs to the weapon platform and its
mission. Additionally, focus on minimal impact to system availability
and maintainability.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Research and develop
methodologies for proof-of-concept on a representative system that has
multiple protections other than this irrefutable evidence of event
detection technology. The purpose should be to demonstrate the
feasibility, uniqueness, and robustness of the protection that the
proposed technology will offer. Estimate the performance
impact.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Based on the Phase I research; develop,
demonstrate and validate a prototype of the developed methodologies or
techniques on a representative weapon platform. Conduct an analysis to
evaluate the ability of the technology\u2019s functional effectiveness
in a real-world situation. The contractor should also identify any
anticipated commercial benefit or application opportunities of the
innovation.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Integrate the
developed technology into a system application, for a system level
test-bed. This phase will demonstrate the application to one or more
military systems, subsystems, or components \u2014 as well as the
product\u2019s utility against industrial espionage. Conduct an analysis
 to evaluate the performance of the technology\/technique in a
real-world situation. For transition, consider a partnership with a
current or potential supplier of missile defense systems, subsystems, or
 components.&amp;nbsp;COMMERCIALIZATION: The proposals should show how
the innovation can benefit commercial business or that the innovation
has benefits to both commercial and defense applications. The projected

        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Information
Systems&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Develop and implement an innovative hardware
 and\/or software solution that, in response to user or system command,
can detect and identify electronic network (wired and\/or wireless)
infrastructure components, employ state of the art methods and
technologies to automatically or under human-in-the-loop control
configure the network components, and test\/monitor the viability of the
 components to satisfy a predefined network architecture
definition.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: The missile defense modeling and
simulation mission and test infrastructure may benefit from the
development of a self-establishing network capability. Such a capability
 will enable the autonomous establishment and maintenance of network
connections by a primary network control node between remote components
of a simulation or test according to a pre-defined network
architecture.The capability developed under this topic should
incorporate innovative networking technologies to create a new
autonomous networking capability. While other networking capabilities
such as the Self-Organizing Networks (SONs) used in modern ad-hoc mobile
 and sensor networks utilize some autonomous connectivity and
configuration capabilities, which may be leveraged in the development of
 this research, this topic differs in that the networking capability
designed will create networks which will be established from a single
control node with architectures that are defined by the user at the time
 of build, may be unique from build to build, may be re-defined and
re-built according to user specifications, and which conform to DoD
Cyber Security protocols. These requirements necessitate an entirely new
 capability which will require new research to develop and implement.The
 research performed under this topic will identify the external network
nodes that can be exploited to expand the network to meet the
architecture topology. The network control node initiates control
commands to configure the external nodes to meet the specified
architecture parameter definitions. The control node also autonomously
monitors the network and rebuilds or reconfigures the network when
sub-components no longer meet the architecture parameter definitions or
when desired changes to existing network architectures are specified by
the user, and provides reports on the health and status of the network.
Additionally, it provides for user oversight, management, intervention,
and override of autonomous networking operations at all stages to ensure
 user control of autonomous networking and security activities. Upon
completion of the network expansion and configuration, the control node
then provides results of the network build and compliance with the
architecture definitions.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Develop a design product
which will present a notional architecture to be pursued in creating a
hardware and\/or software solution providing a self-establishing network
 capability which conforms to the user-specified network architecture
and security constraint. The design will capture the key areas where new
 development is needed, suggest appropriate methods and technologies to
realize the design based on the research performed, and incorporate new
technologies researched during design development. Develop a plan for
verification and validation (V&amp;amp;V) of the design once built.The
results of this phase will provide recommendations for what is needed to
 fully meet the architectural definition described above and identify
where gaps exist. The proposed network design will also comply with DoD
Cyber Security protocols, ensuring that network connections are only
formed between authorized nodes at the same level of information
security, that those connections pass data securely, and that tools are
in place for the autonomous detection and mitigation of security
breaches.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Using the design developed in Phase I,
produce a small-scale prototype self-establishing network capability
which can be used for test &amp;amp; evaluation of the basic networking
and cyber security components of the design and identify areas where new
 development is needed. Develop new hardware and\/or software
technologies to support the prototype design proposed in Phase I.
Perform V&amp;amp;V of the prototype according to the plan developed in
Phase I to ensure that the priority objectives are adequately met. This
prototype work will be used to inform the development and implementation
 of a mature, full-scale capability in Phase III.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III
DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Scale-up the self-establishing network capability
 from the prototype utilizing the new hardware and\/or software
technologies developed in Phase II into a mature, fieldable capability.
Develop an interface to provide the user with reports of the
completeness of network builds and compliance with the user-defined
network architecture and cyber security protocols, and facilitate user
oversight, management, intervention, and override of the system when
necessary. Deploy the fully tested, verified, and validated capability.
The contractor will commercialize the Phase III hardware and\/or
software, enabling an autonomous establishment or re-configuration of a
wired and\/or wireless network in accordance with a user-defined network
 architecture and adhering to user-defined network and cyber security
preferences and\/or protocols (desired security options may be
selectable by the commercial user). Such autonomously configured
networks will adhere to and provide for user oversight, management,
intervention, and override of autonomous networking operations at all
stages of operation.This innovative technology will support increased
speed and ease of secure network building and management in the private
sector as well as secure business system
integration.&amp;nbsp;COMMERCIALIZATION: This innovation technology for
the autonomous establishment of secure networks has clear application
beyond the scope of DoD systems. This technology can be applied to
modems, routers, switches, hubs, protocol standards, ISO standards, IEEE
 standards, etc.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: Self-Establishing Network, Systems

        "topic_name": "Inline Threat Generation for Modeling and
Simulation",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Information SystemsThe
technology within this topic is restricted under the International
Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), which controls the export and import
of defense-related material and services. Offerors must disclose any
proposed use of foreign nationals, their country of origin, and what
tasks each would accomplish in the statement of work in accordance with
section 5.4.c.(8) of the solicitation.&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Elicit new
and innovative approaches to perform inline threat generation (ITG) in a
 constructive digital simulation, without having to pre-generate the
threat data, in order to stimulate modeling and simulation (M&amp;amp;S)
 used for missile defense performance assessment.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION:
High-fidelity, constructive digital simulations are used to assess the
performance of missile defense at the element and system level.
Pre-scripted input files consisting of high-fidelity data that
effectively portray the kinematics, signatures and lethality-related
traits of red force missiles in a \u201ctruth\u201d sense, stimulate
various models so that the truth inputs are appropriately
\u201cperceived\u201d by the missile defense element models and
simulations during simulation runtime. There are currently no processes,
 tools, or software that can generate the necessary detailed high
resolution truth data \u201cinline\u201d during runtime of a
constructive digital simulation.New innovative technologies are needed
that will enable ITG in these high-fidelity constructive simulations.
This innovative capability would enhance the credibility of simulations
in the M&amp;amp;S Enterprise, shorten integration time (enabling
efficiency gains and reducing event schedules), produce greater
quantities of quality, credible decision quality data, and expand the
envelope of behaviors assessed via M&amp;amp;S by allowing red forces to
 react and change "inline" based on what is occurring on the simulation
\u201cgameboard\u201d during runtime. If successful, the approaches
developed under this effort could be applied to the problem of producing
 similar truth data for blue force interceptor flyouts.Input data
considerations: The ITG capability should be able to take as inputs the
minimal set of parameters and inputs that are currently used for
offline, pre-scripted threat generation tools, as well as any parameters
 that may be required for simulated responsive behavior of the threat
object that could not have been predicted priori. This input data would
include both \u201cscenario independent\u201d missile and signature
characterization\/data from the Intel community and other threat
authorities, as well as \u201cscenario specific\u201d parameters about
any and all particular missile flyouts in any given scenario.Runtime
considerations: The slower a simulations runs, the less the assessment
data that is available. The inline threat approach being investigated
here would presumably shift the time investment of threat data
production from "pre-execution" to "in-execution". The end-state desire
would be that, when rolled up, this shift in where and when threat data
is generated would be a net positive in terms of impacts to simulation
employment timelines, as compared to the legacy, pre-scripted approach.
In other words, we do not want inline threat generation to so \u201cbog
down\u201d the runtime performance of the overall simulation that, in
the end, the simulation employment timeline would have been better off
to have stayed with pre-scripted threats. To that end, also note that
the use of the word "inline" does not mean that leveraging of already
pre-existing threat data, at least as a point of departure during
runtime, for example, is necessarily prohibited.V&amp;amp;V
considerations: \u201cOffline\u201d threat tools and their outputs are
rigorously validated and verified as \u201cstandalone\u201d modeling
software and are used to create pre-scripted threat data. Information
provided by the appropriate authorities in the Intel and threat
communities validate these missile models and corresponding signatures.
An inline threat capability needs to adopt and apply the same rigor and
processes that the credibility of threat data created by ITG is
similarly unimpeachable. It may seem obvious or a truism to say that
software tools should be verified and validated; however, it is
highlighted here as a special concern and emphasis area for the use of
M&amp;amp;S for performance assessment.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Develop a
proof-of concept prototype\/demonstration of the ITG approach, including
 a simulation conceptual model and top-level architecture of how a
high-resolution ITG capability would be integrated into a
system-of-systems simulation comparable or traceable to a simulation.
Demonstrate approaches to verification and validation of the ITG.
Proof-of-concept for this phase may be related to unclassified surrogate
 red force and blue force models or other systems, or options for a
stand-in for the overarching simulation could be provided GFE. The Phase
 I effort could be appropriately scoped to an initial subset of inline
threat data production demonstration versus the entire threat data
package. Provide an initial CONOPS for V&amp;amp;V of the inline threat
tool. Demonstrate initial capability for truth interaction of threat
data creation, i.e. modification or creation of threat data during
runtime in reaction to truth data that emerges on the runtime
"gameboard", in a way that could not have been pre-scripted and was not
explicitly part of the user input parameters.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Using
the conceptual model and insights gained from the Phase I prototype,
develop a working ITG, encompassing a capability to generate inline all
types and amounts of threat data currently developed today for
performance assessment simulation. Major emphasis of Phase II would then
 be on a rigorous V&amp;amp;V demonstration and benchmarking against an
analogous legacy set of threat generation capabilities.&amp;nbsp;PHASE
III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Deploy working ITG capability within missile
defense applications. Develop operational interfaces with existing
simulation tool sets. Update the ITG to keep pace with adversary data
and threat models needed for current-day simulation efforts. Support all
 activities for endorsement\/accreditation of the ITG capability leading
 to accreditation by the appropriate authorities. Ensure that design
encompasses modularity (i.e. upgradeability) and usability, such that
keeping pace with operational threat changes does not entail massive ITG
 development efforts and code changes, but rather input parameter
changes, with documentation via conceptual model, specifications and
user instruction, per M&amp;amp;S development best practices.
Investigate expansion of ITG capability to also encompass blue force
interceptor truth data generation.&amp;nbsp;COMMERCIALIZATION: The
technology developed here could tie into commercial opportunities
related to high-speed computing as related to simulation of complex
systems-of-systems.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: Simulation, Missile Modeling,

Systems&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Provide the government with a set of
capabilities that significantly reduces the time and effort associated
with integrating complex system simulations.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: As
missile defense simulations become more complex, integration efforts
also become increasingly more complex, resulting in significantly
increased software integration times. Further increased software
complexities are present within a distributed simulation enterprise.
Missile defense simulations would benefit from new and innovative
advances in technology and processes in order to shorten
system-level-simulation integration time.The capabilities developed
under this topic should incorporate innovative software development
technologies to create a robust set of enterprise-level tools and
techniques to overcome system-level integration challenges. While
traditional software and hardware development technologies focus on

innovative, bi-directional fiber laser\/amplifier output tap couplers
for use in high power fiber laser weapon systems, extending the
efficiency, reliability and power handling beyond 1kW per
channel.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: High energy lasers are required for a
number of military applications including long range sensing, target
designation and illumination and missile defense. Electric lasers are
considered the laser of choice in the long-term since the energy supply
is rechargeable and clean. The preferred type of electric laser is the
semiconductor diode-pumped fiber laser or amplifier, which integrates
well with other sensors and electro-optic elements in an aerospace
environment. This topic seeks proposals for demonstration of concepts
and hardware which would enable high-brightness, high-power scaling of
fiber lasers\/amplifiers.&amp;nbsp;High power fiber optic tap couplers
are needed to monitor and control optical amplifier output power, phase,
 pathlength and polarization of double clad gain fibers in all-fiber
optical amplifier configurations. For non-polarization maintaining gain
fiber operated in a linearly polarized output architecture, it is
necessary to pick-off a small amount of amplified output signal for
feedback to a control loop that can adjust the input polarization state
to yield a linearly polarized output state. High power capable fiber
optic tap couplers are required for the development and maturation of
co-directional and counter-directional pumped all-fiber architectures to
 increase ruggedness and reliability for combined power scaling. The
ideal tap coupler minimizes loss for the throughput signal for
efficiency and power handling capability while picking-off a small
amount of signal for closed loop control of polarization, phase and path
 length matching for coherent beam combining.Spectrally combined fiber
amplifier systems do not require phase and path length matching but do
require linearly polarized output for efficient beam combining. High
power capable fiber tap couplers compatible with large mode area double
clad fibers, polarization maintaining, and non- polarization maintaining
 fibers are needed. Additionally, tap couplers for photonic crystal
fibers and photonic band gap are needed. Fiber tap coupler designs are
targeted for lasing of Ytterbium ~1064nm and Thulium ~2000nm. Optical
efficiency of the tap coupler, power handling and bidirectionality will
be used as metrics for all phases.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Deliver a design
for a kilowatt capable fiber optic tap coupler and packaging for large
mode area Ytterbium and Thulium doped double clad fiber. Criteria for
the design includes, bi-directional power handling capability,
polarization, phase and path length pick-off with robust packaging.
Designs compatible with photonic crystal and photonic band gap gain
fibers are also sought.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Based on Phase I designs and
models; build, test, and demonstrate multi-kW capable bi-directional
prototype fiber optic tap couplers and conduct in-depth characterization
 of hardware to show a maturity of technology toward potential
commercial and military applications. Deliver packaged devices to
solicitor designated government labs for high power
evaluation.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Demonstrate
multi-kW capable bi-directional prototype fiber optic tap couplers
packaged for insertion into militarily relevant fiber laser weapons
systems. Team with missile defense integrators to demonstrate maturity
and technical readiness in military
environments.&amp;nbsp;COMMERCIALIZATION: High power handling optical
fiber tap couplers enable fabrication of compact and reliable fiber
laser technologies for immediate insertion into military systems.
Industrial commercial applications include materials marking, cutting
and welding for a wide array of automated manufacturing. In a rapidly
emerging medical application, tattoo removal is also an area where
all-fiber optical power monitoring and control is
needed.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: High Power Fiber Tap Coupler, High Power All

scaling law capabilities needed to obtain high fidelity solutions and
model laser systems that contain multiple\/obscured
apertures.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: High energy laser (HEL) systems with
spatially distributed architectures offer the potential for
substantially reduced volume while mitigating thermal management
requirements at the laser source (i.e., offers the potential for
distributed thermal management). This beam combining method uses
multiple lasers spatially distributed across the beam director\u2019s
entrance pupil. The approach also uses inexpensive high bandwidth
electrooptic modulators and positioners to control the piston, tip, and
tilt of each optical beamlet train, allowing for the overall system to
apply a wavefront correction (without the use of combining elements or
deformable mirrors) so that the beamlets coherently combine at the
target. Current commercially available scaling law modeling and
simulation packages, such as SHARE or HELEEOS, do not have the
capabilities needed to obtain high-fidelity solutions and model HEL
systems that contain multiple\/obscured apertures. Scaling law modeling
and simulations with these capabilities are sought to enable trade space
 analyses to be performed to determine the technical viability of the
spatially distributed aperture HEL system approach as an alternative to
current technical approaches for missile defense
applications.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Develop a scaling law model for HEL
systems that are composed of either multiple apertures that are
spatially distributed and\/or a single aperture that is obscured.

engineering design constraints (e.g., diffraction, jitter, aero-optic
disturbances, atmospheric propagation, beam control, radiometry, etc.)
for the selected approach(es).&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Using the model
developed in Phase I, develop packaged modules that are user friendly
with proper documentation and have the potential to be implemented in
current commercially available scaling law packages such as SHARE or
HELEEOS. When needed, validation experiments should be used to reduce
risk of model uncertainty.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Use
 the modules developed in Phase II to perform solicitor selected trade
studies. Develop a more convenient way of defining different HEL system
configurations and advance methods for bookkeeping the power lost to
different HEL system configurations.&amp;nbsp;COMMERCIALIZATION: The new
 scaling law packages will provide military and commercial HEL system
developers the ability to compare different systems (e.g., end-to-end
systems with beam directors that are off-axis unobscured, centrally
obscured, spatially distributed with multiple subapertures, and\/or
conformal phased arrays) and to tradespace analysis necessary for
effective planning and decision making.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: High Energy

innovative infrared (IR) readout integrated circuit (ROIC) technology,
including digital and three dimensional (3-D) ROICs that will enable
large format, high sensitivity, high resolution, large dynamic range,
large field of view (FOV), and fast data rate dual-band IR focal plane
arrays (FPAs) for missile defense applications.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION:
The long read time and limited data-rate and dynamic-range capabilities
of analog ROICs limit sensor performance. Analog ROIC output signal is
susceptible to noise requiring added shielding and additional
electronics for subsequent signal processing. Digital readout integrated
 circuits (DROICs) using in-pixel processing and an all-digital readout
can provide low noise, wide dynamic range, wide FOV, high resolution,
and fast readout rate for overcoming limits imposed by readout circuits
on sensors. With the emergence of through-silicon via 3-D packaging and
3-D stacked fabrication technology a future ROIC is capable of more
processing on the imager chip creating the potential for smaller, low
power systems. Innovative technical solutions are solicited for a ROIC
architecture\/design that meets the following goals: format 512 x 512 or
 larger; pixel pitch from 10 micrometers to 30 micrometers; operating
temperature 60 - 90 Kelvin; bias range 0 - 1 Volt; detector bias
resolution less than 5 millivolts; equivalent well capacity up to 50
million electrons; read noise less than 200 electrons; dynamic range 14-
 22 bits; full frame rate up to 200 Hz; power consumption less than 300
mW; and matching detector quantum efficiency 45 - 70%. The proposed
solutions should also include a design that mitigates the effect of
harsh manmade and natural radiation environments, including high energy
particles and photons to prevent catastrophic system
failure.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Develop a preliminary design for
the proposed algorithms and electronics architectures. Modeling,
simulation, and analysis of the design must be presented to demonstrate
clearly how near-term goals will be met. Proof-of-concept hardware
development and test is highly desirable. Proof-of-concept demonstration
 may be subscale or specific risk reduction activities associated with
critical components or technologies. Preliminary experimental results
can be used in conjunction with modeling and simulation to verify
scaling laws and feasibility.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Finalize the design of a
 prototype ROIC including all supporting modeling, simulation, and
analysis. Validate the feasibility of the proposed technology developed
in Phase I by development of the prototype and demonstration of a
ROIC-enabled FPA for characterization testing at a dual-band level.

Sensors&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Seek innovative solutions to improve
performance of the next generation reserve batteries. Improvements
should allow for geometric flexibility of batteries, increased energy
density, longer shelf life, and manufacturability.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION:
 Currently, a variety of reserve batteries power missile defense
applications. These power systems have specific requirements that
include a long shelf life (up to 20 years), high voltage levels
(&amp;gt;100V in some cases), high power density, high energy density,
safety, and reliability. Examples include thermal batteries and lithium
oxyhalide. Current thermal batteries can achieve peak specific powers
greater than 10kW\/kg and specific energies greater than 125Whr\/kg at
the battery level. Similarly, lithium oxyhalide batteries can achieve
peak specific powers greater than 2kW\/kg and specific energies greater
than 250Whr\/kg at the battery level.Future missile defense applications
 are projected to require more power and longer runtimes in smaller
spaces, which will necessitate greater power density and energy density.
 Technologies that increase operating time or reduce size and weight are
 desired. In addition, current reserve batteries are geometrically
constrained. Missile defense applications seek battery technologies that
 could enable a more conformal shape in order to achieve a higher
volumetric energy density. The proposer could achieve improvements
through enhanced packaging efficiency, materials, or electrolytes.Focus
areas for manufacturability enhancements include improved processes for
materials, assembly, inspection, quality control, and modeling. Seek
manufacturing processes that allow scalability with minimal design
changes of the new battery technology. Designs should allow for
electrical verification testing of the battery and periodic health
monitoring throughout the battery shelf life.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Complete
 an initial design for the battery technology to demonstrate the proof
of concept. Include laboratory experimentation and\/or modeling to
verify the proposed concept. Deliver an initial design for the prototype
 along with performance estimates.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Complete a
detailed prototype design and construct a prototype for testing in a
simulated environment. Testing should verify design assumptions and
performance estimates. Include a detailed design and detailed
performance analysis from the prototype testing.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL
 USE APPLICATIONS: Work with missile defense integrator to refine
requirements and demonstrate the technology in a relevant environment. A
 successful Phase III would transition the technology into a missile
defense application.&amp;nbsp;COMMERCIALIZATION: Pursue
commercialization in both DoD and non-DoD applications. Reserve
batteries have uses in other military and commercial applications
including guided munitions, launch systems, and single use emergency
systems.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: Reserve Batteries, Packaging Efficiency,

of defense-related material and services. Offerors must disclose any
proposed use of foreign nationals, their country of origin, and what
tasks each would accomplish in the statement of work in accordance with
section 5.4.c.(8) of the solicitation.&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Develop
accelerometers, gyros, and inertial measurement units (IMUs), based on
micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies capable of
performing under missile defense application shock and vibration
environments.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: Gyroscopes and accelerometers
employed in missile defense IMU applications encounter severe shock and
vibration during storage, transport, launch, staging, deployment, and
engagement. In addition, IMUs in flight systems (interceptors, airborne
platforms, and space assets) are constrained by limits on size, weight,
power and cost (SWaP-C) while requiring high performance. Current
state-of-the-art tactical IMUs utilize optical technology (ring laser
gyros and fiber optic gyros) which can be sensitive to temperature,
shock and vibration. MEMS technology promise to offer smaller, lighter,
and less expensive to produce IMUs than optical systems since integrated
 circuit manufacturing production techniques are utilized in MEMS
fabrication. However, MEMS based IMUs have been known to experience
performance degradation while operating through stressing shock and
vibration environments. Proposed MEMS solutions should focus on
producing reliable, durable, and accurate components that operate
without performance degradation under all shock and vibration
environments encountered by flight systems. Current industry standard
tactical IMUs (e.g. LN-200 FOG and HG1700 IMUs) provide baseline SWaP
and performance standards for any proposed effort.Also, applicable
portions of Department of Defense document MIL-STD-810, Environmental
Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests, and the Air Force Space
 Command and Space and Missile Systems Center document SMC-S-016, Test
Requirements for Launch, Upper-Stage and Space Vehicles, may serve as
useful guides for the testing.In addition to typical accelerometer and
gyro performance values used to quantify performance, two performance
ranges should be considered. The first is the shock response spectrum
amplitude (g) versus frequency (Hz) range and, the second, for
vibration, is the power spectral densities (g^2\/Hz) versus frequency
(Hz) range.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Conduct experimental and\/or modeling
efforts to demonstrate proof-of-principle of the proposed technology to
operate in high shock and vibration environments. Demonstrate the

technology would be significant. Hence, the anticipated Phase III

Locations",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREA(S):
Materials\/Processes&amp;nbsp;ACQUISITION PROGRAM: PM Combat Support
Systems (CSS), PdM Expeditionary Power Systems (EPS)&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE:
 Develop innovative approaches to enable a Marine unit to harvest energy
 in locations that are covered with low direct-light levels and low wind
 levels.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: Logistics resupply of power, both fuel
and batteries, is a major burden on a Marine Company and can limit their
 desired operations. The USMC Expeditionary Energy Strategy and
Implementation Plan (Ref. 1) states an ultimate goal of eliminating
liquid fuel needs except for mobility platforms by 2025. Several
renewable energy efforts are underway to get the Marine Corps closer to
this goal (Ref. 2); however, most of these efforts are focused on
technologies that are most efficient in open sunny locations. With the
Marine Corps push to the Pacific and locations where terrain will
consist of denser foliage areas, the more standard solar and wind
technologies will not be as effective. There is a need for technology
that can harvest energy in covered locations which would reduce the
Marines total logistical burden of fuel and batteries. Currently all
fielded renewable energy systems require open uncovered locations for
deployment. Systems such as wind and solar do not perform well near or
under covered locations such as in forests or jungles. Known harvesting
technology that can be used in covered locations such as waste-to-energy
 technology is currently too bulky, time consuming to initiate and
unreliable for small units of Marines. Other efforts have been looked at
 such as micro-hydro turbines, hand crank generators, and biomass energy
 converters. All of these systems have had deficiencies in ether size,
weight, operational area limitation, or ease of deployment, making them
currently unsuitable for wide use. The Marine Corps deploys in a variety
 of environments and needs advanced technology that will allow for
harvesting of available energy in locations that are covered (Ref.
3).The Marine Corps is interested in innovative approaches in the
development of renewable expeditionary energy systems. Proposed concepts
 must be able to operate in temperature ranges of -20\u00b0F to
125\u00b0F in rain, dust, salt conditions and survive transit over rough
 terrain (Ref. 4). Proposed concept systems must be light and compact
allowing a small number of Marines to carry and deploy the system. The
objective for an individual component is no more than a 2 person lift
(88lbs). To limit deployment area and overall weight, the proposed
concepts should be scalable and have energy densities greater than
25W\/ft^2 and 5W\/lbs. Proposed concepts should have minimal start up
time (&amp;lt; 10 minutes for 2 people) allowing the Marines to rapidly
set-up and start powering their equipment. It is anticipated that
successfully developed energy harvesting concepts would be used in
conjunction with the USMC renewable energy and hybrid systems.
Therefore, proposed concepts will be required to have either a nominal
24V output which is fairly stable (MIL-STD-1275F) or a 120V AC output
(MIL-STD-1332B) (Ref. 5,6).&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Develop concepts for
harvesting energy in covered locations that meet the requirements
described above. The small business will demonstrate the feasibility of
the concepts in meeting Marine Corps needs and will establish that the
concepts can be developed into a useful product for the Marine Corps.
Analytical modeling and simulation may be used to demonstrate
feasibility. The small business will also articulate a plan for Phase II
 development that identifies performance goals, key technical
milestones, and, as appropriate, any technical risk reduction
strategy(ies).&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and
the Phase II development plan, develop and deliver a prototype system
for government evaluation. The prototype will be evaluated to determine
its capability in meeting the performance goals defined in the Phase II
SOW and the Marine Corps requirements for renewable energy systems.
System performance will be demonstrated through prototype evaluation and
 over the required range of parameters as discussed in the Description
above. Evaluation results will be used to refine the prototype into a
final design. The company will prepare a Phase III development plan to
transition the technology for Marine Corps use.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL

expected to support the Marine Corps in transitioning the technology for
 Marine Corps use. The small business will develop a plan to determine
the effectiveness of the renewable energy system in an operationally
relevant environment. The small business will support the Marine Corps
for test and validation to certify and qualify the system for Marine
Corps use. As applicable, the small business will prepare manufacturing
plans and develop manufacturing capabilities to produce the product for
military and commercial markets.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: Renewable energy;

 Optics and Non-Lethal Systems (ONS), MCPC 240111\nThe technology within
 this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms
Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and
import of defense-related material and services, including export of
sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR),

disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies)
 of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement
 of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in
accordance with section 5.4.c.(8) of the solicitation. Offerors are
advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be
restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control
Laws.\n&amp;nbsp;\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a system for locating the source
of hostile small arms fire without the requirement for direct line of
sight to the point of origin. The system shall consist of head, body,
and\/or hand-held components to provide real-time location data to a
dismounted Marine during tactical movement. This topic addresses energy
efficiency and operational costs by reducing the power and expense
associated with fixed-site and vehicle mounted anti-sniper and
counter-fire sensor systems.\n&amp;nbsp;\nDESCRIPTION: Acoustic gunshot
detection systems utilizing microphone arrays are capable of
establishing the approximate point of origin and trajectory of small
arms fire, but are easily confused in multi-path reflection
environments, including mountainous regions and urban canyons. The same
mountainous and urban environments can constrain the use of line of
sight based gunfire location techniques, such as muzzle flash detection,
 and \u201cpre-shot\u201d capabilities that actively search for optical
augmentation retro-reflections from potential threats, providing little
utility to other friendly forces not equipped with their own gunfire or
pre-shot sensors. Active illumination pre-shot systems also have the
potential to reveal friendly force locations to hostile forces equipped
with imaging devices operating within the same wavelengths. Reference 1
provides additional details of these capabilities and their limitations.
 Dismounted Marines are currently equipped with various direct-view
visible light and indirect-view image intensification and thermal
imaging systems operating in infrared imaging bands. Under ideal viewing
 angle (parallel, but not perpendicular, to line of sight) and
environmental conditions, some devices are capable of briefly perceiving
 small arms projectiles in flight, either directly or indirectly via
their wake, but without sufficient detail to reliably track to the point
 of origin.\nPrior research (see Ref 2) indicates that small arms
projectiles in flight are strong emitters in infrared bands,
particularly Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR). Dismounted Marines typically
utilize uncooled Long-wave Infrared (LWIR) imagers, such as the
AN\/PAS-28 Medium Range Thermal Imager and AN\/PAS-30 Mini Thermal
Imager (see Ref 3 and 4), due to their low cost (less than $10,000), low
 power (less than three Watts), and near-instant start-up time, but
these systems have only demonstrated reliable imaging of relatively
large or slow projectiles, such as grenades. Handheld MWIR imagers are
available in the USMC inventory, but their high cost (greater than
$20,000) and cooling needs (up to eight Watts and greater as ambient
temperature increases, cool-down times measured in minutes) are accepted
 for only the longest range (over 2,500 meter) imaging applications. The
 currently fielded AN\/PAS-22 Long Range Thermal Imager (see Ref 5) is
an MWIR device, but has a restricted field of view, low resolution, and
insufficient imaging frame rate to resolve small, high speed projectiles
 perpendicular to observer.\nThis topic seeks to explore innovative
approaches in the development of a man-portable, battery powered,
small-arms fire location system that is handheld, head mounted, and\/or
body worn for use by an individual dismounted Marine observing from
positions of protective cover during tactical movement and, ideally,
while also on-the-move. Proposed concepts shall utilize thermal imaging
technology to acquire, display, and extrapolate a partial small arms
projectile (Russian caliber 5.45mm, US caliber 5.56mm and greater)
track, passing at any angle within tactically relevant range (hundreds
of meters) of the observer, to the point of origin. Accuracy of points
of origin shall (threshold specification) have an average azimuth error
of less than five degrees from the observer\u2019s point of view, and an
 average range estimation error of less than 20%, during conditions of
no-obstructing terrain between the source and observer. Accuracy should
(objective specification) be less than two degrees average azimuth
error, and less than 10% average range error. Thresholds are
specifications that meet requirements; while objectives are
specifications that exceed minimal requirements and are of a particular
interest. Observed tracks shall be graphically distinguishable from
extrapolated paths, and overlaid on actual, real-time, terrain scenery
to assist observer orientation. Proposed concepts shall have a
probability of detection of no less than 70%, day or night and
commensurate with the threat weapon capabilities (ex., 500 meters for
5.45mm and 5.56mm caliber rifles; 2,000 meters for 12.7mm caliber heavy
machine gun weapon systems). Proposed concepts should not utilize
pre-mission terrain maps or other external mapping platforms. Concepts
may, but are not required to, include additional electro-optical,
acoustic, or other sensors to achieve accuracy requirements or cue other
 sensors with higher fidelity, but shall remain passive (no deliberate
emissions) while in operation. The ability to refine accuracy through
networked, open architecture, multi-user observations is desirable;
however the system must meet requirements with a, passive, stand-alone
capability. Concepts shall be capable of acquiring and temporarily
storing (for at least fifteen minutes) the tracks of multiple weapons
firing near-simultaneously, including those operating at a high rate of
fire (up to 2,000 rounds per minute). For the purposes of Phase II
demonstration, proposed sensor components (including sensor level analog
 to digital conversion and onboard calibration and image enhancement
functions, but not including output capture and projectile track
processing hardware) should consume a total of no more than eight Watts
of power over an ambient operating temperature range of -40C to +49C.
Collected imagery and track analysis should be presented within one
minute of firing events (a burst of machine gun fire counts as one
event). The goal for Phase III is for collected imagery and track
analysis to be presented to the user within 5 seconds or less after
firing events. The Phase III system and power supply capacity shall be
sufficient for eight hours of continuous surveillance, including no less
 than 250 distinct firing events detected and correlated to point of
origin. The weight of Phase III head-mounted, hand-held, and\/or
body-worn components (including batteries), shall not exceed 500 grams,
two kilograms, and seven kilograms, respectively.\n&amp;nbsp;\nPHASE I:
Develop concepts for an improved approach for locating the source of
hostile, small-arms fire without the requirement for direct line of
sight to the point of origin that is capable of meeting the requirements
 stated in the Description above. The company will demonstrate the
feasibility of the concepts in meeting Marine Corps needs and will
establish that the concepts can be developed into a useful product for
the Marine Corps. As applicable, the company will conduct detailed
analysis of relevant target sets, concepts of employment, and sensing
schemes necessary to achieve the desired capability. Where feasible, and
 within the scope and resources of the Phase I effort, key technical
concepts shall be demonstrated. The small business will also articulate a
 plan for Phase II development that identifies performance goals, key
technical milestones, and, as appropriate, any technical risk reduction
strategy(ies). The company shall also provide a draft Phase II test and
evaluation plan identifying any required resources necessary to acquire
data for Phase II prototype design refinement. The plan should include
the gathering of live-fire data collection utilizing non-Government
resources, should sufficient research literature not be available during
 Phase I.\n&amp;nbsp;\nPHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and the
 Phase II SOW, the small business will gather additional data, via
live-fire observations, to refine the design and develop a prototype for
 evaluation. Access to Government furnished weapons, ammunition, and
range facilities may be requested; however, the company shall provide a
plan to conduct live-fire data collection utilizing non-Government
resources (as part of the company\u2019s Phase II prototype testing and
evaluation). At the completion of the Phase II contract, the prototype
developed shall have a minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5,
component and\/or breadboard validation in a relevant environment, and
demonstrate the ability to meet required capabilities, utilizing
critical technology components, such as sensors, representative of Phase
 III concepts. In Phase II testing and evaluations, low risk
technologies (such as image processing electronics) that can be
optimally scaled physically and for power consumption with available and
 proven techniques, may be represented by commercial components (e.g. a
tethered general purpose computer with high performance graphics
processing units that can be replaced with an embedded field
programmable gate array solution in Phase III). Test and evaluation
results will be used to refine the prototype into an initial design that
 will meet Marine Corps requirements for a dismounted Marine platform
solution. The company will prepare a Phase III development plan to
transition the technology to Marine Corps use.\n&amp;nbsp;\nPHASE III
DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: If Phase II is successful, the company will be
expected to support the Marine Corps in transitioning the technology for
 Marine Corps use. The company will develop a self-contained and
ruggedized solution and any respective components optimized for
evaluation to determine its overall system effectiveness against
realistic threats. The company will support the Marine Corps for test
and validation to certify and qualify the system for Marine Corps use.
As applicable, the company will prepare manufacturing plans and develop
manufacturing capabilities to produce the product for military and
commercial markets.\n&amp;nbsp;\nKEYWORDS: Hostile Fire Indication;

provide high-voltage protection to reduce the risk of electrical shocks
from low overhead wires for dismounted radio operators while providing
equivalent or better radiation pattern and gain in existing hand-held
and man-pack radio antennas.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: Marine Corps Systems
Command (MARCORSYSCOM) provides radio and antenna material solutions to
the Marine Corps. In an operational environment, dismounted Marines can
encounter low-hanging wires such as unregulated power distribution lines
 which present the potential for an electric shock hazard. These lines
can be unpredictable in height and voltage. Dismounted Marines operate
hand-held or man-pack radios with long collapsible whip (8 to 10 ft.) or
 blade antennas (3 to 4ft) (Ref 1 and 2). The configurations allow for
the possibility of an electrical shock hazard should direct contact be
made with a power line. While whip antennas exhibit good size and weight
 characteristics for the performance they provide, they pose a shock
hazard in these types of environments due to their length and all metal
construction. Intermediate length blade antennas are more manageable,
but are also not designed for the electrical safety of the operator. The
 development of technology solutions for this type of environment
creates several challenges. Electrical antennas (monopoles) need to be
in upright position to perform well and display the appropriate
omni-directional pattern. However, doing this increases visual cueing to
 the enemy. An operator in \u201cprone\u201d position (under fire) could
 also experience substantial degradation in antenna performance due to
reflections off of the ground plane. While higher amplification could
facilitate the use of a shorter antenna height, this could in turn
negatively impact the available portable battery power carried by each
warfighter as higher amplification would require more available power.
Wearable antenna solutions (e.g. solution that wraps around the
individual) are available; however, they could potentially pose Hazards
of Electromagnetic Radiation to Personnel (HERP) concerns. These
solutions also are limited by the use of one frequency band and
typically have insufficient power for communications. Loop antennas
provide a means to reduce the height significantly, but with a
cross-looped design (such as an eggbeater), it becomes impractical for
an individual to use. Presently, a temporary solution has been deployed
but this solution is a simple antenna sheathing that is considered a
temporary work around and not integrated with the antenna. At this time,
 there are no robust, viable technology solutions for this ongoing need
in the application cited.MARCORSYSCOM is looking for non-invasive,
innovative approaches that can be installed in the field for our fielded
 antennas described previously, to reduce the risk to the operator by
providing high-voltage protection to 20KV RMS (35KV RMS objective) while
 also providing equivalent or better radiation pattern omnidirectional
gain as well as a solution that is difficult for the enemy to visually
detect. The antennas\/solutions of most interest are for use with
hand-held and man-pack tactical radios in the High Frequency (HF), lower
 Very High Frequency (VHF) bands (2 to 88 MHz), and 33-88mhz Single
Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS). The following
hand-held and man-pack tactical radios use those above mentioned bands:
AN\/PRC-150, AN\/PRC-117F, AN\/PRC-117G and AN\/PRC-152 (Ref 3 and 4).
The radios use N Type and threaded Neill\u2013Concelman (TNC) antenna
connectors. Concepts proposed must not negatively impact or damage the
high voltage wires encountered and must pass a high voltage performance
test. Proposers should be prepared to discuss the level of protection
their technology solution(s) provides, the technology used to achieve a
proposed level of protection, and any applicable antenna\/solution
performance information. Proposers should employ open architecture
designs principles as much as is practicable. Preference will be given
to solutions that do not cause permanent modifications to the current
Marine Corps systems. For maximum range and reliability, the dismounted
Marine requires the antenna to be light and flexible (Ref 3 and 4). A
collapsible design is not required but, if applicable to the proposed
concept, would be helpful for storage and transportation.&amp;nbsp;PHASE
 I: The company will develop concepts for reducing the risk of electric
shock in the event that a hand-held or man-pack radio antenna makes
contact with a live power source pursuant to the requirements described
above. The company will demonstrate the feasibility of the concepts in
meeting Marine Corps needs and will establish the concepts can be
developed into a useful product for the Marine Corps. Feasibility will
be established by material testing and analytical modeling, as
appropriate. The company will provide a Phase II development plan with
performance goals and key technical milestones, and that will address
technical risk reduction.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Based on the results of
Phase I and the Phase II development plan, the small business will
develop a scaled prototype(s) for evaluation. The prototype(s) will be
evaluated to determine the capability in meeting the performance goals
defined in the Phase II SOW and the Marine Corps requirements as stated
in the Description section. System performance will be demonstrated
through prototype evaluation and over the required range of parameters
as discussed in the Description above. Evaluation results will be used
to refine the prototype(s) into a final design. The company will prepare
 a Phase III development plan to transition the technology for Marine
Corps use.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: If Phase II is
successful, the company will be expected to support the Marine Corps in
transitioning their technology for Marine Corps use. The company will
finalize the design for evaluation to determine effectiveness in an
operationally relevant environment. The company will support the Marine
Corps for test and validation to certify and qualify the system for
Marine Corps use. As applicable, the company will prepare manufacturing
plans and develop manufacturing capabilities to produce the product for
military and commercial markets.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: antenna; tactical

Materials\/Processes&amp;nbsp;ACQUISITION PROGRAM: PM Combat Support
Systems (CSS), Family of Water Purification Systems&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE:
Development of a Squad level (13 Marines) water purification system (8
gallons\/hour) capable of purifying water sourced from any location with
 a low to zero energy consumption while maintaining the purification
standards in TB MED577 (Ref. 1).&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: Purification of
locally sourced water is critical to reducing the logistical supply
lines of forward deployed Marines. Large, Battalion sized (Ref. 2),
water purification systems exist within the Marine Corps which are
capable of purifying water from any source. However, purification of
water at smaller force structures can be difficult as space allocations,
 weight restrictions and available energy sources are limited. The
present method of supplying water at the Squad or Platoon level (43
Marines) is to air-drop bottled water or by trucking water purified or
produced at a Forward Expeditionary Base (FOB). The process of
desalinization is viewed as being one of the highest power demand
processes in water purification systems. Desalination of water obtained
from any source to support Squad or Platoon operations remains a
significant technical challenge. Commercially available water
purification systems operate on a much smaller scale and are only able
to handle low-salinity (brackish) sourced water. These systems are not
scalable and would require an external generator to provide the power
necessary to facilitate the desalination process. Innovative research
has been performed in nanophotonic effects allowing for high efficiency
direct solar membrane distillation, which could allow desalination of
water at resource limited locations (Ref. 3). This process holds the
potential to greatly increase typical desalinization permeates yields,
while decreasing desalinization energy expenditures. This is one example
 of basic research that could be applied to water purification to
increase efficiency of the systems. Successful development of this
concept would allow the Squad to facilitate a greater level of
selfsufficiency increasing the Commander\u2019s flexibility to deploy
this size force. Being able to purify water locally reduces the total
cost of supplying water compared to constant resupply of bottled water.
In addition, the reduced fuel consumption will reduce the life cycle
cost of the water purification system.The Marine Corps is interested in
innovative approaches in the development of a water purification system
for Squad sized forces. The Squad sized system should be able to purify
6-10 gallons\/hour, weigh no more than 10 lbs, and have a volume of less
 than 1.5 cubic feet. Of particular interest are approaches which can be
 scaled to handle Platoon level purification of 12-30 gallons\/hour (up
to 90 gallons\/day) from salt water sources, weigh no more than 84 lbs.
and have a volume of less than 15.5 cubic feet. The Marine Corps is
required to fight in any location and be highly expeditionary and
proposed concepts must be very mobile, surviving transport over rugged
terrains (Ref. 2, 4). They must also be usable in any climate the
Marines operate in, including desert, jungle and temperate climates as
spelled out in MIL-STD-810G (Ref. 4). Concepts proposed must include an
automatic water quality test capability and method for providing visual
indication (a simple go\/no-go indication) as evidence that the water
source has been purified to an acceptable level (Ref 1). Concepts should
 also be operable by a single individual who does not have water quality
 certification or training. In addition to being able to purify a wide
variety of contaminated water sources, proposed concepts must be energy
efficient to help reduce the logistical fuel burden on the expeditionary
 forces while minimizing the need for energy from batteries or other
fuel sources (less than 100W during contaminated water purification) and
 must not require excessive operator mechanical energy for
operation.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: The small business will develop concepts
for an improved water purification system that meets the requirements of
 the Description section above. The small business will demonstrate the
feasibility of the concepts in meeting Marine Corps needs and will
establish that the concepts can be developed into a useful product for
the Marine Corps. Analytical modeling and simulation may be used to
demonstrate feasibility. The small business will also articulate a plan
for Phase II development that identifies performance goals, key
technical milestones, and, as appropriate, any technical risk reduction
strategy(ies).&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and
the Phase II contract Statement of Work (SOW), the small business will
develop and deliver a prototype water purification system to the USMC
for evaluation. The prototype will be evaluated to determine its
capability in meeting the performance goals defined in the Phase II SOW
and the Marine Corps requirements for water purification as discussed in
 the Description above. System performance will be demonstrated through
prototype evaluation over the required range of parameters as discussed
in the Description above. Evaluation results will be used to refine the
prototype into a final design. The company will prepare a Phase III
development plan to transition the technology to Marine Corps
use.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: If Phase II is
successful, the small business will be expected to support the Marine
Corps in transitioning the water purification system technology for
Marine Corps use. The small business will develop a plan to determine
the effectiveness of the new water purification system in an
operationally relevant environment. The small business will support the
Marine Corps for test and validation to certify and qualify the system
for Marine Corps use. As applicable, the small business will prepare

Optics and Non-Lethal Systems (ONS), MCPC 240111The technology within
this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms
Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and

sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR),

advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be
restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control
Laws.&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: The objective is to develop, demonstrate and
manufacture low size, weight, and power (SWaP) display and optical
technologies for presentation of enhanced vision system imagery for
dismounted Marine mobility (i.e., movement in darkness and degraded
visibility environments) and target acquisition, and electronic display
symbology for command, control, and navigation applications, while
retaining the ability to see the outside world in a manner that does not
 reveal the operator\u2019s location via stray light emissions. This
topic addresses energy efficiency and operational costs by combining the
 functionality of multiple display devices.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION:
Marines utilize low light imaging sensors in the form of night vision
goggles (NVGs) to conduct movement, target acquisition, and manual tasks
 in conditions of low ambient light. The most commonly utilized NVG is
the AN\/PVS-14 Monocular Night Vision Device (see Ref 1). The majority
of NVGs occlude the eye when in use, and must be rotated over the head
or detached when entering environments of high ambient light to allow
the Marine to have an unrestricted field of view (FOV). The transition
from bright and dark environments and corresponding stowing and
re-engagement of NVGs creates periods of vulnerability as the
Marine\u2019s attention is temporarily diverted to make the adjustment.
Similarly, hand held command, control, and navigation devices, such as
Global Positioning System receivers, typically require supplemental
illumination to view, such as a backlit display or flashlight. However,
this could potentially reveal location at night and inhibit local
situational awareness and use of individual weapons when hands and
attention are occupied. The predominant example of see-through displays
applied to NVGs is the AN\/PVS-21 Low Profile Night Vision Goggle
(LPNVG) (see Ref 2). The LPNVG optically folds the output of standard
night vision image intensifiers, which are offset to the side of the
head, to partially transparent display surfaces in front of the
operator\u2019s eyes overlaying the images onto the outside world.
Visible light emissions are not readily apparent through the display
surfaces when observed from in front of the operator. However, the
relatively low transparency of LPNVG display surfaces limit the ability
to acquire targets when ambient conditions are too bright for night
vision sensors and too dark to clearly see through the display.
Monochrome head mounted displays (HMDs) developed for pilotage
applications are increasingly available, and may be extremely bright
(1,500 candelas per square meter or greater) for daytime viewing, but
color HMDs utilize broadband light sources with partial reflectance
optical surfaces that allow light to pass out the front. Light emission
limitations are not critical for pilotage applications due to the
extreme distance of any potential observer; however, light security is
essential to dismounted operations to prevent hostile forces from
detecting Marines by the illumination from their night vision or other
electronic display devices reflecting off their eyes and skin.The U.S.
Marine Corps in interested in innovative approaches in the development
of light secure, see-through display technology (ies) amenable to
monocular and binocular configurations while providing the ability to
view high resolution (described below), full color (red\/green\/blue -
no less than 256 greyscale levels per color) video imagery, while
transmitting no less than 50 percent of incoming ambient light (average
across visible spectrum) to the operator without noticeable haze,
distortion, or optical seam line artifacts. Light security shall be from
 the perspective of an observer with unaided, dark-adapted eyes standing
 ten meters in front of the operator and attempting to detect
illumination on surfaces (skin, eyes) directly occluded by the
transparent display when operating at nighttime brightness settings and
clear starlight (0.0007-0.002 lux ambient illuminance). For all proposed
 concepts the display optics, light engine (light emitting array or
illumination source and modulation system), and associated minimal
structural framework to maintain alignment and spacing between elements
shall be no greater than 250 grams per eye.For the purposes of Phase II
demonstration, the weight specification does not include articulating
structures for head mounting and optimal positioning of the display in
front of the eye(s), or associated application platform electronics,
protective enclosures, heat dissipation, cabling, and power sources.
Proposed light engine and associated alignment\/spacing structures
concepts shall not occlude viewing below or to the sides of the display
optic. Transparent or wireframe structures concepts that do not
significantly occlude vision are acceptable, but shall count toward the
total weight. The display shall require no more than 1 Watt of power per
 eye for the light engine (assumes the use of a Low Voltage Differential
 Signaling or similar interface for pre-processed video inputs) when
operating at moonlit night (0.27-1 lux ambient illuminance) viewing
brightness and presenting full resolution imagery (all pixels active at
an average of 50 percent peak night viewing brightness) at no less than
60 frames per second. The display should (objective specification)
require no more than 1 Watt of power per eye when presenting symbology,
such as GPS waypoints, compass headings, and\/or target locations,
comprising no less than 0.2 percent of active pixels viewable under
indoor lighting operating brightness (320-500 lux ambient) conditions.
Thresholds are specifications that meet requirements; while objectives
are specifications that exceed minimal requirements and are of a
particular interest.The display should have a maximum brightness
sufficient for viewing symbology outdoors under full daylight
(10,000-25,000 lux) conditions. The display active area shall have a
horizontal FOV no less than 48 degrees, a vertical FOV no less than 40
degrees, and a resolution of 38 to 50 pixels per degree. Eye relief and
viewing offset\/angle (eyebox) shall be sufficient to accommodate an
operator wearing corrective vision or ballistic eyeglasses while running
 with the display attached to a ballistic helmet with a three- or
four-point suspension system. The combined head-mounted weight of the
Phase III demonstrator including optics, display, imaging sensor,
display driver electronics, enclosure, and adjustable helmet mounting
hardware should not exceed 1 kilogram in either monocular or binocular
configurations. Computing elements for symbology generation and sensor
image post-processing for display inputs, and battery power supply may
be body-worn, and should not exceed 7 kilograms weight.Potential light
engine technologies amenable to power efficient low brightness, high
pixel count imagery and high brightness, low pixel count symbology
include, but are not limited to, organic light emitting diode arrays and
 microelectromechanical raster scanning laser systems (see Ref 3 and 4).
 Examples of lightweight display optics include, but are not limited to,
 multi-layer holographic waveguides, free-form prisms, and ellipsoidal
mirrors (see Ref 5 and 6). Of particular interest are concepts that
minimize forward protuberance, maximize airflow to prevent fogging, and
prevent pooling of rain or other liquids within the active viewing area
while standing or prone. Proposers should be mindful that any proposed
display optic materials shall be ballistic polymers or shall incorporate
 structures that reduce hazardous flying debris when shattered and
resistant to abrasion by blowing and hand-wiped sand and
dust.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: The small business will explore the application
of innovative concepts for the development of light secure, see-through
display technology (ies) amenable to monocular and binocular
configurations that meet(s) the requirements as detailed in the
Description above. The small business will demonstrate the feasibility
of the concepts in meeting Marine Corps needs and will establish that
the concepts can be developed into a useful product for the Marine
Corps. As applicable, the company will conduct size, weight, and power
analyses, optical modeling and will provide a preliminary design as a
means of demonstrating the ability to meet or exceed the stated
capabilities. Where feasible, and within the scope and resources of the
Phase I effort, key technical concepts shall be demonstrated. The small
business will also articulate a plan for Phase II development that
identifies performance goals, key technical milestones, and, as
appropriate, any technical risk reduction strategy (ies). The small
business shall also provide a draft Phase II test and evaluation plan
identifying any resources necessary to acquire required data for Phase
II prototype design refinement.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Based on the results
of Phase I and the Phase II SOW, the small business will refine their
designs and develop scaled prototypes with a minimum Technology
Readiness Level (TRL) of 5, component and\/or breadboard validation for
evaluation in a relevant environment. The prototypes shall demonstrate
the ability to meet required capabilities while utilizing optical
elements with manufacturing and integration schemes representative of
Phase III concepts. Simulated sensor imagery and command and control
symbology may be in the form of pre-recorded inputs to the displays. The
 display mounting scheme shall be amenable to direct viewing of imagery
and external scenery by an observer under the specified ambient lighting
 conditions. Low risk technologies (such as video graphics driver
electronics) not part of the developmental effort that can be optimally
scaled physically and for power consumption with available and proven
techniques, may be represented by commercial components (e.g., a
tethered general purpose computer and a high performance video graphics
driver card that can be replaced with an embedded field programmable
gate array solution in Phase III). As applicable, the small business
will prepare a Phase III development plan to transition the technology
to Marine Corps use.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: If Phase
II is successful the small business will be expected to support the
Marine Corps in transitioning the technology for Marine Corps use. The
company will fabricate ruggedized systems with a minimum Technology
Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 (defined as system\/subsystem model or
prototype) for demonstration in an operationally relevant environment.
Adjustable position helmet mounts will be required for evaluation to
determine effectiveness without the demonstrator tethered to a fixed
location. In addition to an integrated command and control symbology
generator, an imaging sensor capable of demonstrating full resolution
and frame rate scene presentation shall be utilized to simulate night
vision capability in real-time. This can include low cost (less than
$10,000) commercial silicon cameras with near-infrared cut-filters
removed to permit non-visible flood illumination operation, and should
be of unity magnification and aligned parallel to the display viewing
angle. The company will support the Marine Corps for test and validation
 to certify and qualify the display and optical components for
integration into future Marine Corps night vision goggle systems. As
applicable, the company will prepare manufacturing plans and develop
manufacturing capabilities to produce the product for military and
commercial markets.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: Head Mounted Display; See Through

Materials\/Processes&amp;nbsp;ACQUISITION PROGRAM: PM Combat Support
Systems (CSS), PdM Expeditionary Power Systems (EPS)&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE:
 Develop a renewable energy hybrid system in the 1kW power range that
will reduce the weight and volume by 50% compared to the currently
deployed 1kW systems.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: During Operation Enduring
Freedom, fuel and water accounted for seventy percent of the logistics
required to sustain Marine Corps and Army expeditionary forces ashore. A
 Marine infantry company today uses more fuel than an entire infantry
battalion did merely a decade ago. This increase in the demand for
\u201cliquid logistics\u201d places a significant risk and strain on the
 distribution pipeline and increases the overall weight of the Marine
Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF). A 2010 study found Marine and Army units
in Afghanistan average one casualty for every 50 fuel and water convoys.
 The demand for fuel, batteries, and bottled water places more Marines
on the road and has become the soft underbelly of our forces. To counter
 this logistical problem the USMC started several initiatives in
renewable hybrid systems to reduce fuel consumption on the battle field
with an ultimate goal of eliminating liquid fuel needs, except for
mobility platforms, by 2025 (USMC Expeditionary Energy Strategy and
Implementation Plan). One of these initiatives was the establishment of
the Ground Renewable Expeditionary Energy Network System (GREENS) II
Program to incorporate current renewable technologies that will provide
only limited weight and volume savings for the current deployed systems.
 More significant weight and volume reductions are needed to increase
the deployment options for these systems. Rethinking the construct of
renewable hybrid systems may be necessary to achieve this goal.For these
 reasons, the Marine Corps seeks the development of technology that can
reduce the weight and volume of current deployed renewable hybrid
systems. For renewable energy systems to be effective in tactical
environments they must be able to reliably provide power no matter the
environmental or transportation conditions (MIL-STD- 810G, (Ref 1).
Because of this many of the available renewable systems are required to
be hybridized type systems that use energy storage, power management and
 backup power generation from generators and vehicles. Current state of
the art in Marine Corps tactical renewable energy systems in the 1kW
sustained power range is GREENS. This system has a total weight of
around 700lbs and volume around 44ft^3 once all the components are
considered (renewable energy, power electronics, inverter, energy
storage, cabling and power manager). Unfortunately, force structures in
the 1kW power range are small tactical units, platoons (43 Marines) and
squads (13 Marines) with only human lift capabilities (MIL-STD-1472G,
(Ref 2)) making the current systems useful in limited scenarios. If
these systems can see a reduction in weight and volume by at least 50%,
then the adoption of these types of systems can be increased greatly.
These reductions can potentially be found in the renewable energy
technology, electronics technology, packaging technology, and energy
storage technology or by completely rethinking the construct of what a
hybrid energy harvesting system consist of. To support USMC applications
 a nominal 24V output (MIL-STD-1275D, Ref 3) or a 120V AC output
(MIL-STD-1332B, Ref 4) is required. Proposed system concepts must also
be able to provide power both night and day.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: The small
 business will develop concepts for an improved ultra-light weight and
compact hybrid system that meets the requirements described in the
Description above. The small business will demonstrate the feasibility
of the concepts in meeting Marine Corps needs and will establish that
the concepts can be developed into a useful product for the Marine
Corps. Feasibility will be established by material testing and
analytical modeling, as appropriate. The small business will also
provide a Phase II development plan with performance goals, key
technical milestones, and a technical risk reduction
strategy.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and the
Phase II SOW, the small business will develop and deliver to a renewable
 energy hybrid system prototype for government evaluation. The prototype
 will be evaluated to determine its capability in meeting the
performance goals defined in the Phase II SOW and the Marine Corps
requirements for hybrid systems. System performance will be demonstrated
 through prototype evaluation and over the required range of parameters
as discussed in the Description above. Evaluation results will be used
to refine the prototype into a final design. The company will prepare a
Phase III development plan to transition the technology for Marine Corps
 use.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: If Phase II is

(3D) interconnect technology between heterogeneous wafers in an effort
to significantly reduce the Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWAP-C) of
current and future systems.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: As 2.5D\/3D technology
 starts to reach mainstream production in the electronics industry,
opportunities exist to develop this technology for use in many defense
applications. Dense levels of integration at the wafer interconnect
level and potentially the device level would significantly reduce the
SWaP (Size, Weight and Power) of current and future systems. Oftentimes,
 in both military and commercial systems, requirements exist for a
non-standard reticle size or interconnect technology to meet custom
application needs. This solicitation will explore the ability of the
current industry wafer fabrication base to create custom wafer stacks
with a large number of interconnects in the vertical (via) and
horizontal (trace) dimensions across an entire wafer and wafer stack.It
is desired to fabricate, at the end of Phase II, a five layer wafer
stack that consists of wafers at least 150mm in diameter, with each
wafer containing a minimum of 500,000 interconnects to the wafer above
and\/or below it. The topmost and bottommost wafers are excluded from
this requirement and need only demonstrate interconnects to the wafer
above or below. The interconnect density should be evenly spread across,
 to the extent possible, the entire 150mm wafer stack. Current IC
technology has high interconnect density in the chip itself but
interconnect technology to the circuitry above or below, for example in a
 wafer stack, is typically much less.A methodology to test every
connection from a DC perspective is required to obtain yield data. The
wafer stack must contain at least one Silicon wafer, and may contain
more than one, but it is ultimately desired for the wafer stack to
contain other substrate materials. Sapphire, Gallium Arsenide, Silicon
Dioxide, Gallium Nitride (GaN), and Indium Phosphide are potential
candidates, and may be integrated with other materials, for example GaN
on diamond. Other material or combinations thereof may be submitted for
consideration. The bonding and interconnect methodology is not defined
and up to the performer to determine. The performer must show that any
bonding techniques do not cause detrimental effects, for example too
high of a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch causing
structural damage, to any potential active devices contained within any
of the candidate substrates. The desired interconnect metal is copper to
 maintain maximum compatibility with current industry fabrication
techniques, however other interconnect metallurgy will be considered if
appropriate. If required, a handle wafer may be counted as one of the
mandatory wafers.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Phase I is a technology feasibility
phase and will determine the best fabrication processes and
methodologies to design, fabricate, and test a wafer stack meeting
previously discussed requirements. A report detailing the outcome of
Phase I is required. The report should describe the approach to be used
to demonstrate 3D interconnect between wafers if awarded the Phase II
effort.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Phase II will require the successful bonding
of at least three wafers, one of which must be Silicon and one of which
must be another dissimilar material, having at least one million
measurable connections between the wafers, with greater than 99%
yield.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: If Phase II is
successful, the small business will provide support in transitioning the
 technology for Navy use, with a focus on scaling manufacturing
capabilities and commercialization plans.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS:

Characteristics in Harsh Environments",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Ground\/Sea Vehicles,
Sensors&amp;nbsp;ACQUISITION PROGRAM: Strategic Systems Programs (SSP),
ACAT I&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Develop and validate a portable, non-invasive
 sensor suite and post-processing capability that will accurately
measure spatially resolved, time-dependent pressure, temperature,
void-fraction, and velocity data within a multi-species, highly
turbulent, supersonic flow through a short, thick-wall, curved steel
pipe, without any element of the sensor suite permanently altering or
physically crossing the pipe boundary.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: A novel
approach to collecting flow performance data (i.e., pressure,
temperature, density, voidfraction, and velocity) is needed to support
routine performance assessments of Navy hardware systems and needs to be
 demonstrated in a test environment. To minimize the high cost and
safety impacts associated with hardware modifications and test conduct, a
 portable, non-invasive sensor suite is needed. The non-invasive sensors
 must collect data by instrumenting the outer surface of a pipe.
Permanent modifications to the pipe structure are prohibited due to
safety, cost, and logistical concerns. Legacy data do not provide the
level of understanding desired to assess system performance and to
support validation and eventual use of newly developed computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) based modeling and simulation (M&amp;amp;S) tools
because no solution currently exists to capture this data. New spatially
 resolved, time-dependent flow data will provide an improved
understanding of the underlying physics within the flow phenomena, and
also support flow performance assessments and predictions with the CFD
M&amp;amp;S tools.The current hardware under test consists of an
upstream high pressure inlet mixing with a reservoir connected to a
short, curved, thick steel pipe that flows the mixture of steam, water
(from the reservoir), gas and pressure inlet by products into a larger
chamber. The pipe is the area of measurement interest and is
approximately 19-inches in diameter, has a 2-inch thick steel wall
structure, contains one bend of less than 90 degrees and has an
available straight pipe length of less than 5-inches. The environment to
 be measured during hardware tests is a high-pressure, high temperature
mixture containing at least water\/gas\/steam created by igniting a
double-based grain solid propellant (inlet pressure) into a water-filled
 reservoir. As the solid propellant expends itself, the mixture combines
 with propellant particulates. The noise generated by the solid
propellant combusting has a broadband acoustic signature that is in the
order of hundreds of decibels. The high-level, broadband acoustic noise
environment may corrupt acquired data, particularly if the sensing
method is ultrasonic in nature. The total duration, from ignition to
propellant expended, lasts approximately 1 second.The flow through the
curved pipe can be characterized as multi-phase (i.e., water, steam, and
 propellant gases), compressible, nonhomogeneous, turbulent, and highly
transient with the potential presence of shock waves within the pipe.
During the ~1 s duration test event, the pressure in the pipe is
expected to rise to ~600 psia; the temperature is expected to rise to
~400 \u00b0F; and flow is expected to have a mean motion velocity of
~800 ft\/sec may exist.Through industry searches, it has been determined
 that current commercially available technologies' response times and
sampling rates are insufficient to non-invasively collect sufficient
data. Additionally, any invasive sensor suite would be exposed to the
harsh environments and would need to withstand the high temperatures,
high velocities and high pressures. Historically, there have been
difficulties with sensor survivability, which can result in loss of
valuable data.An innovative, non-invasive, prototype sensor is needed to
 obtain some, if not all, of the following short duration (~5 ms)
time-average, spatial and temporal resolved
data:PressureTemperatureDensityMulti-phase void fraction (i.e., ratio of
 liquid to gas\/steam\/propellant mixture)Velocity&amp;nbsp;PHASE I:
Determine technical feasibility and develop a non-invasive, portable
sensing system that can discern the presence of water, gas, and\/or
steam flowing within a 19-in. diameter, short (&amp;lt; 5-in. of
straight length), curved, 2-in. thick steel pipe at flow speeds of up to
 800 ft\/s. Perform analysis, modeling and simulation, and\/or
laboratory investigations\/demonstrations to provide initial assessment
of approach. The size of the sensor suite is of less concern during the
Phase I effort, as long as it is shown that the physical foot print of
the sensor suite can be reduced in later phases.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II:
Based on Phase I effort, further develop and demonstrate a non-invasive
and portable sensing system that can measure and accurately quantify (to
 within 10%) the flow characteristics (i.e., pressure, temperature,
density, void-fraction, and\/or velocity) of a multi-phase fluid that is
 multi-species, compressible, and highly turbulent. This sensing system
should be capable of being sized appropriately to fit within an
approximately 3\u2019x3\u2019x3\u2019 volume. Performance of a
demonstration to prove capabilities of the new system will be required.
It can be expected that the government will provide the hardware under
test in order to simulate the environment that needs to be
measured.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The mature sensing
system will transition into the program of record and will be used to
assess system performance and to support validation and use of newly
developed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based modeling and
simulation (M&amp;amp;S) tools. This technology and the data obtained
from its use will be used on possible future programs as
well.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: Non-intrusive; sensor; multi-phase; supersonic;

II (ACAT IC)The technology within this topic is restricted under the
International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130,

accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 5.4.c.(8) of the
solicitation. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform
 on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US
Export Control Laws.&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimum design
concept for a high energy, high flux detector for use with the High
Energy Computed Tomography (HECT) that meets our mission goals of both
inspection capability and system supportability. Trident II rocket
motors are currently inspected using a HECT system to inspect for
critical defects that affect motor safety and reliability. Objective is
to develop the design concept into a usable x-ray detector for the use
with the Varian-supplied K15 Linatron source. Access to a K15 will be
made available at the Naval Air Warfare Center China Lake. This will
include the x-ray detector, as well as all support electronics and
necessary hardware to integrate it into the existing system. The
intention is to develop a replacement for the detector, which is a
subsystem of the HECT, which must work with the radiation source (The
Varian K15).&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: The current HECT system, used to
inspect the D5 Trident II rocket motors, is an old design using outdated
 technology. As such, it has become expensive to maintain and support.
The intention of this effort is to develop a new x-ray detector that is
improved for performance (based on bit depth and resolution) and
supportability (based on ability to procure and maintain hardware),
using modern electronics, components, and interfaces. This is a
difficult problem as the radiation environment is both high energy and
high flux. Radiation hardening impacts detector performance. This
program will develop a new detector with modern components and materials
 that has equal or improved performance and is more supportable for the
inspection of these rocket motors.One of the (non-Navy owned) HECT
systems currently in use was updated in the early 1990s and resulted in
large improvements in system performance and supportability. This
demonstrates that system performance can be greatly improved in all
aspects. However, the materials, technology, and design from that
upgrade have been made obsolete by improvements in detector technology
and electronics, which made huge leaps in capability in the 2000s. A
research and development (R&amp;amp;D) effort is necessary to ensure
that new detector technology can be modified and\/or redesigned to be
able to operate in our specific environment (specifically, radiation
hardening).&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Determine technical feasibility to develop
 a new High Energy High Flux X-ray Detector as discussed in the
Description section. Develop conceptual design and select 2-3 of the
most optimum detector design concepts. These concepts will be
implemented in a detector that allows performance evaluation (in
particular regarding resolution, bit depth, and detector life), with an
understanding of the tradeoffs of performance specifications,
reliability, and supportability. A technical report will be generated
detailing results and tradeoffs between the designs.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II:
Develop and deliver a prototype detector, usable with the K15 on D5
Defect Standards, along with a report containing a full evaluation of
its actual performance and capability as used with the K15.
Demonstration of improved resolution, bit depth, and detector life will
prove out the design and allow progression to Phase III.&amp;nbsp;PHASE
III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Based upon Phase I and II effort, fabricate
full scale High Energy High Flux X-ray Detector Array and transition to
Navy for use in inspecting D5 Trident II rocket motors in the HECT
inspection system. Engage in broader commercialization efforts to field
this x-ray detector suitable for use in the high energy environment.
Possible customers include Army, Navy, Air Force, NASA, large solid
rocket motor industry suppliers, Department of Homeland Security, and
other countries that use K15 Linatron x-ray sources to inspect rockets
for their space program.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: x-ray; high energy; high

        "topic_name": "Re-Entrant Jet Measurement During Large-Scale Gas
 Bubble Collapse",
        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Ground\/Sea Vehicles,
Sensors&amp;nbsp;ACQUISITION PROGRAM: Strategic Systems Programs (SSP),
ACAT I&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Develop and validate a new instrumentation
sensor suite and associated processing techniques to capture the size,
shape, composition, and velocity of a re-entrant jet formed during
large-scale bubble collapse near a moving boundary. The sensor system
must collect spatially resolved, time-dependent void-fraction, density
and velocity data.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: When a pressurized volume is
suddenly opened, such as when a payload exits a launch tube, there is a
sudden \u201cuncorking\u201d of pressurized gas that expands out of the
volume. If a moving surface (boundary) is what is initially in place to
maintain the pressure in the volume, the gas expands out of the volume
and directly behind the moving surface. This \u201cuncorking\u201d event
 forms a large bubble that expands to a maximum size before collapsing
(due to local hydrostatic pressure) and forming a re-entrant jet which
then contacts the moving surface. This re-entrant jet presents a threat
of damage due to high-speed impact with the moving surface. Re-entrant
jet behavior is observed in various other disciplines, including
cavitation research and underwater explosions [UNDEX]. In each of these
problems, the jet is formed when the bubble is placed near and allowed
to collapse into a solid boundary. In spite of the widespread interest
in this problem, the dynamics of large-scale bubble collapse are not
well understood. This is due in part to the difficulty of performing
direct measurements of the bubble collapse phenomena.To-date,
measurements of the uncorking and re-entrant jet phenomena for a moving
plate have been limited to qualitative, underwater video of the bubble
and limited pressure and load measurements on the moving surface. Visual
 methods have provided limited information on the jet due to opacity of
the bubble interface. The objective is to develop a sensor suite to
quantitatively measure the size, shape, and velocity of this re-entrant
jet throughout its formation and as it impacts\/interfaces with the
moving surface. In a notional test environment, the bubble is planned to
 uncork with an overpressure of approximately 20 pounds per square inch
differential (psid) (relative to the local hydrostatic pressure), and
then expands out to a diameter of approximately 10 feet. The bubble
travels upward due to buoyancy and the influence of the moving surface,
which is traveling in the same direction. Bubble collapse occurs after
10-15 feet of upward travel. The bubble then continues to oscillate,
resulting in multiple re-entrant jet formations during the time that the
 moving surface moves to the free surface of the water. At the time when
 the moving surface broaches the water surface, the jet forms one last
time, impacting the moving surface with significant force. Another
factor making measurements more difficult to collect is the addition of
vented gas from the moving surface, which increases the opacity of the
environment that a measurement device would need to be able to resolve.
The venting results in a steady stream of small bubbles that surround
and join the base bubble that is generated, creating a highly opaque and
 turbulent region.Market and historical searches have confirmed that
instrumentation suites have not been able to view or collect data on
this water jet within this region of vented gas.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I:
Define and develop a new instrumentation sensor suite that can provide
accurate measurement of the reentrant jet. Perform analysis, including
modeling and simulation and breadboard testing, to ensure concepts can
be utilized with major features of the full-scale environment as
discussed in the Description section. This environment would include
both underwater and surface capture of the phenomena at the described
geometries and pressures for this high speed event.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II:
Based on the Phase I effort, develop a large-scale version prototype of
the new instrumentation sensor suite for demonstration and validation.
The prototype should be delivered at the end of Phase II to be utilized
on subscale testing. The large scale version prototype would need to be
able to view an approximately 20 ft wide underwater area by 50 feet
tall. It would also need to view a 20 ft wide area above
water.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: If Phase II is
successful, the small business will provide support in transitioning the
 technology for Navy use. The small business will develop a plan to
determine the effectiveness of the sensing system in an operationally
relevant environment. The small business will support the Navy with
certifying and qualifying the system for Navy use. As appropriate, the
small business will focus on scaling up manufacturing capabilities and
commercialization plans. Completed system(s) will be delivered to the
Navy for use.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: Sensor; instrumentation; multi-phase;

Gail Nyikon, gail.nyikon@us.af.mil.&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Develop
innovative methods, tools and techniques to recover the implemented
software architecture of a cyber-physical system in the absence of
source code or other program information.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: The
understanding of the architectural design of a system (such as a nuclear
 reactor safety system or vehicle operations system) is crucial in
assessing the system\u2019s security posture and robustness. Even if the
 original design of a software architecture is known, the implemented
architecture may vary due to implementation choices related to
performance, efficiency, language constructs, patching, etc. While
reverse engineering and binary analysis tools for desktop applications
have been developed for some time, tools for embedded applications
(e.g., supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems,
industrial control systems (ICS), embedded systems, etc.) are either
immature or non-existent. In addition, vulnerability analysis at a
software design and source code level cannot uncover all
susceptibilities because additional software (e.g., library routines,
firmware, etc.) are integrated into the architecture and are potential
malware sources.In order to truly understand weaknesses, a mechanism is
needed that can extract the \u201cas-built\u201d architecture from the
machine code and achieve a high level of confidence that the recovered
architecture representation is accurate. This mechanism should: (1)
Identify critical security points in the architecture, (2) discover the
functionality of individual system components and (3) enable cyber
security engineers to scrutinize critical access points and potential
susceptibilities in the system. This technology could be used by systems
 engineers either to analyze \u201cblack box\u201d architectures where
the design is unknown, or to verify that a software system has been
implemented and performs as designed which, in turn, would make it
possible to discover when a system has been compromised and does not
function as intended.A focus on real-time embedded systems and real-time
 operating systems is highly desirable. A solution that runs on Linux or
 Windows in a desktop environment and can accept binaries from a variety
 of operating systems (Linux, Windows, VxWorks, Integrity, LynxOS, etc.)
 and architectures (ARM, x86, PowerPC, etc.) is more relevant than a
solution that is OS and\/or architecture specific.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I:
Describe &amp;amp; design creative methods\/techniques\/tools for
recovering and reconstructing architecture of an implemented software
system, accurately modeling and displaying the architecture, and
assessing its security posture. The result should use common modeling
standards (SysML, UML, etc.) where possible.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Develop,
 implement and validate a prototype tool that utilizes the
methods\/techniques from Phase I. The prototype(s) should be
sufficiently functional to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach on
 a representative realworld software system. Models produced by the tool
 should highlight potential cyber access points and weaknesses or
susceptibilities in the system. Initial compatibility with a variety of
processing architectures is desirable, but the solution may initially
focus on one.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The ability to
accurately model and validate an implemented system architecture for
verification and assessment will be an invaluable tool for ensuring the
safety and security of DoD systems with additional uses in security and
safety sensitive industries such as commercial and civil
aviation.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: system, architecture, recovery, analysis,

develop technology to provide a cyber deception capability that could be
 employed by commanders to provide false information, confuse, delay, or
 otherwise impede cyber attackers to the benefit of friendly
forces.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: Deception is defined as a "deliberate act
perpetrated by a sender to engender in a receiver\u2019s beliefs
contrary to what the sender believes is true to put the receiver at a
disadvantage.\u201d (1) Military deception is defined as \u201cthose
actions executed to deliberately mislead adversary decision makers as to
 friendly military capabilities, intentions, and operations, thereby
causing the adversary to take specific actions (or inactions) that will
contribute to the accomplishment of the friendly mission.\u201d (2)
Military forces have used techniques such as camouflage, feints, chaff,
jammers, fake equipment, false messages or traffic, etc. for thousands
of years to alter an enemy\u2019s perception of reality.This effort will
 examine the typical attack steps of; reconnaissance (where the enemy
researches, identifies and selects the target), scanning (where detailed
 information about the target is obtained allowing a specific attack to
be crafted), gaining access (where the attack is carried out), and
maintaining access (where the attack evidence is deleted and information
 is exfiltrated or altered\/destroyed) to identify where and how
deception technologies can be brought to bear to thwart the objectives
of an attack.It is believed that deception techniques, working in
conjunction with normal cyber defense methods, can alter the underlying
attack process, making it more difficult, time consuming and cost
prohibitive. Some work has already been done in cyber deception
technologies; i.e., honeypots are computers designed to attract
attackers by impersonating another machine that may be worthy of being
attacked, honeynets take that further by simulating a number of
computers or a network, and products such as the Deception Toolkit
conveys an impression of the defenses of a computer system that are
different from what they really are by creating phony vulnerabilities.
Modern day military planners need a capability that goes beyond the
current state-of-the-art in cyber deception to provide a system or
systems that can be employed by a commander when needed to enable
additional deception to be inserted into cyber
operations.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: 1. Design and develop techniques and
technologies that could be employed in a representative scenario based
on the criticality of the cyber situation and\/or INFOCON status, 2.
Conduct a complete comparative analysis and, 3. Conduct a
proof-of-feasibility demonstration of key enabling
concepts.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: 1. Develop and demonstrate a prototype that
 implements the Phase I methodology, 2. Identify appropriate performance
 metrics for evaluation, 3. Generate a cost estimate and implementation
guidance for both a modest pilot project and fielding at the Air Force,
regional Network Operations and Security Center or other suitable

 secure commercial mobile devices for information sharing for multiple

disrupt the attacker\u2019s processes at any of these stages by
introducing MTD techniques, we may defeat or at least delay the attack
by increasing the attackers work factor and making them become more
\u201cvisible\u201d and subject to detection and eradication via other
techniques. The methods developed should be compatible with existing
protocols and standards so that they can be applied to most networks.The
 increasing focus on network centric warfare means that the ability to
protect networks will become essential to ensuring the safety of
military operations. Similarly, in the civilian domain the increased use
 of electronic commerce and cyber-physical systems, such as
industrial\/home control networks, is creating a situation where the
ability to resist or delay attacks will become more and more critical
over time.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Describe &amp;amp; develop creative
methods, techniques &amp;amp; tools for causing the perceived\/actual
picture of the network from an attackers perspective to change.
Methodologies should in particular address issues of how to cause
disruption &amp;amp; doubt from an attacker\u2019s perspective but not
add any significant error, confusion\/processing to the protected
network.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Develop, implement and validate a prototype
system that utilizes the tools and methods from Phase I. The prototypes
should be sufficiently detailed to evaluate scalability, usability, and
resistance to malicious attack. Efficiency is also an issue that should
be explored, although it is less critical than overall
scalability.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Demonstrate

Systems&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: To define threat models; develop and
prototype novel, resilient architectures, tools, and techniques to
mitigate threats to cyber-physical system. To develop modeling and
simulation tools that consider the safety and correctness constraints of
 the physical systems and the interaction with the digital
components.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: Cyber-physical systems integrate
computational, networking, and physical resources. Popular examples
include industrial control systems, medical safety systems, software
defined radios, and avionics systems. The computational and networking
resources provide many benefits to the control of physical systems. The
computational resources allow for re-programmability, meaning that bugs
in the design can be addressed on deployed systems, without the need for
 costly hardware replacements. Networking these devices further
increases the ease of reprogrammability, since the operators are no
longer required to physically visit every node that needs re-programmed.
 However, with the increased benefits come many additional challenges
and increased threats.While the benefits of re-programmability and
networked nodes are hard to argue, the increased attack surface from
these additional benefits must be carefully considered, especially for
safety-critical systems. The ability for an adversary to remotely
connect to, and re-program, a control device for a safety system poses a
 significant risk. What is needed are tools, techniques, and systems
that are resilient to these remote adversaries, as well as other types
of failures.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Perform a study to describe the tools,
techniques, and\/or architectures in need of development for
cyberphysical systems in order to limit an adversary\u2019s, or
component failure\u2019s, impact, and allow the cyber-physical system to
 continue to operate in a degraded mode, while still maintaining the
safety properties of the system. The study should include plans for a
Phase II prototype hardware or software module that demonstrates the
enhanced resilience of the CPS.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Develop, implement,
and validate a prototype system that utilizes the architecture, tools,
and methods from Phase I. The prototypes should be sufficiently detailed
 to evaluate scalability, usability, and resilience to attack, or
failure. Efficiency of the architecture is important, especially, in
safety critical applications. Develop novel techniques and tools for
modelling CPS, allowing for modeling\/simulation of the system to ensure
 safety and correctness of the controls.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: Safety-critical control systems span a wide range of
industrial and military applications. Any enhancements to the security
of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) control systems hardware and software
 will have benefits to both military and commercial markets. Transition
of this technology would benefit DoD programs such as SPYDER, MNVR and
Rifleman Radios, as well as the TACDIS Cross Domain Solution and the
Hardware Convergence R&amp;amp;D initiative.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS:

 Modulation",
        "description": "* PROPOSALS ACCEPTED: Phase I and DP2 (Direct to
 Phase II). Please see the 15.3 DoD Program Solicitation and the DARPA
15.3 Phase I Instructions for Phase I requirements and proposal
instructions.*&amp;nbsp;TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Biomedical,
Sensors&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate clinically-viable
bio-interface technologies that have mechanical properties similar to
tissue, yet can interface with conventional benchtop and\/or implantable
 electronics to form complete systems for biological sensing and
modulation. Areas of interest include implantable interface technologies
 for neural and other biological tissue, as well as wearable biosensors
and interfaces.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: There is a critical need for DoD
capabilities that would provide breakthrough medical treatments for
wounded warriors with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety,
immune system dysfunction and other DoD-relevant health issues.
Regulation of neural and other biological functions via interface
technologies has become increasingly enticing as a means of clinical
treatment. For instance, over the past several decades we have seen the
emergence of neural recording and stimulation to restore sensorimotor
capability and vagal nerve stimulation technologies for the treatment of
 epilepsy and depression. While these treatments have achieved moderate
success, existing clinically approved technologies offer limited
stability and precision, which significantly hinders their clinical
translation. Despite recent noteworthy advancements in pre-clinical
electrode technologies, existing devices suffer from reliability
problems, often associated with tissue damage and\/or mechanical failure
 of the device.Even state-of-the-art interface technologies exert high
mechanical strain on surrounding tissues, leading to scarring,
persistent bleeding and neuronal damage. Tissue in the peripheral
nervous system (PNS) has Young\u2019s Modulus of approximately 600 kPa.
Traditional electrodes are manufactured using either fine metal wires,
such as platinum (168 GPa), or microfabricated from silicon (180 GPa).
This six order of magnitude difference in stiffness leads to a number of
 issues\u2014including tissue damage, surgical attachment and relative
motion\u2014which reduce the clinical viability of these technologies.
By developing bio-interfaces with kPa-scale stiffness, it would be
possible to attach neuromodulation devices to the PNS without incurring
these problems. Proposed implantable neural interface devices should be
able to penetrate the tough epineurium of a specified nerve (e.g. vagus,
 ulnar), enter multiple fascicles and accommodate the range of motion
that the nerve typically encounters. Wearable technologies should
similarly match the mechanical properties of skin and tissue to provide
robust, biocompatible solutions for biological interfacing.This topic
seeks to advance the clinical readiness of bio-interface technologies by
 decreasing the biomechanical mismatch between manufactured devices and
biological tissue. The most established approaches in this space use
polymeric substrates with embedded conductors. There have been recent
advances in materials that may push the Young\u2019s Modulus down even
further, such as shape memory polymers that soften when inserted into
tissue. While these advances are important, all still use substrate
materials that have a modulus greater than 10 MPa. Some early
demonstrations of biologic materials such as collagen have yielded crude
 but functional devices with kPascale stiffness properties. Dissolvable
carrier substrates have also shown promising results, but depend heavily
 upon the dissolution rate of the sacrificial material and leave behind
tiny but stiff electrodes.Despite these advances in materials science
and device fabrication, there has been little progress towards
demonstration of functional devices, much less mechanical testing with
ex vivo nerve tissue or in vivo electrophysiological validation. Without
 this validation, promising new technologies will not be adopted by the
neural interface community or medical device
manufacturers.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Proposals to this topic should aim to
develop and\/or demonstrate mechanically compliant yet reliable
biological interface devices that are wearable or implantable, enabling
direct monitoring or modulation of biological signals in peripheral
nerves and organs. Implantable PNS-specific devices should demonstrate
an ability to penetrate the epineurium and perineurium of a nerve to
insert kPa-scale electrodes into individual fascicles, and to do so at a
 scale and precision relevant to neuromodulation therapies. These
devices should include interconnects to mate with standard benchtop or
implantable electrophysiology equipment. Wearable devices should provide
 reliable measurement of biological signals that are relevant to
quantifying health physiology.Phase I deliverables include: Proof of
concept demonstrating the feasibility of manufacturing and implementing
novel soft bio-interface devices. Feasibility may be demonstrated
through a variety of models, including tissue phantoms, in vitro, ex
vivo, or in vivo studies. The final report must include a quantitative
analysis of interface properties and mechanical characteristics. The
final report should also contain detailed plans for Phase
II.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Work in this SBIR topic should focus upon
creating fully functioning interface devices suitable for chronic
implantation in vivo. Performers should develop manufacturing and
testing procedures to produce and verify the flexible bio-interface
assembly. Devices should comprise a set of interconnects, flexible
tethering leads and a compliant substrate containing a multitude of
interface sites for stimulating and\/or sensing neural activity (at
fascicular resolution or better) or measuring biomolecules in vivo. The
interface assemblies must be safe, effective and chronically stable for
long-term use in animals or humans.Phase II deliverables include:
Demonstrate the reliability and scalability of the manufacturing
approach. Proposals should include plans to develop and demonstrate
individual compliant devices using batch manufacturing process flows
capable of producing hundreds of identical devices. Studies should
characterize the morphological and physiological properties of relevant
tissue to develop advanced finite element models and validate these
against ex vivo experiments with the soft interface technology. Phase II
 efforts must also demonstrate the lifetime of the devices through
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), including mechanical, soak and
 electrical testing. Finally, the devices must be tested chronically in
animal models to validate sensing and modulation capability, as well as
cross-talk, impedance and other relevant properties. Tissue samples must
 undergo histological examination to demonstrate the extent of damage
incurred during application or surgical insertion as well as after
chronic use.&amp;nbsp;DIRECT TO PHASE II: Existing technologies that
target peripheral nerves and have demonstrated capabilities are eligible
 for Direct to Phase II applications.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE

and mental health through biocompatible neuromodulation

Defense, ElectronicsThe technology within this topic is restricted under
 the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), which controls the
 export and import of defense-related material and services. Offerors
must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals, their country of
origin, and what tasks each would accomplish in the statement of work in
 accordance with section 5.4.c.(8) of the
solicitation.&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Design, build, and demonstrate a
high-speed (5 GHz), high-sensitivity (NEP &amp;lt; 1pW\/Hz^1\/2)
photodetector with octave spanning responsivity in the mid-wave infrared
 (MWIR) and\/or long-wave infrared (LWIR) spectral
regions.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: There is a critical need for DoD
capabilities that would provide improved detection sensitivity of threat
 explosives and chemical warfare species. The MWIR and LWIR spectral
regions are technologically important for numerous applications
including communications, environmental and industrial monitoring,
thermal imaging, and chemical sensing for defense and homeland security
[1]. Despite the pressing physical motivations for extending such
applications to the MWIR and LWIR, the lack of suitable radiation
sources and detectors in these spectral regions has resulted in
applications being developed in the less favorable, near-infrared (NIR)
spectral region where the telecom industry has driven the development of
 laser and detector technologies. The maturation of quantum cascade
laser technology and the recent development of microresonator-based
optical frequency comb technology [2] have changed the current and
future MWIR\/LWIR landscape. To fully exploit the application potential
[3] of chip-scale optical frequency comb sources now under development,
new high-speed, broad spectral coverage, and highly sensitive detectors
are needed to replace the often bulky, cryo-cooled systems that are
currently in use.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Design a photodetector with
&amp;lt;1 pW\/Hz^1\/2 noise equivalent power (NEP) for operation in the
MWIR (3- 6 microns) and\/or LWIR (6-15 microns) spectral regions. The
photodetector should exhibit the specified NEP without cryo-cooling and
with 5 GHz electronic bandwidth when illuminated by femtosecond to
picosecond pulse trains. Room temperature operation is desirable;
however, cooling and\/or temperature stabilization consistent with
thermoelectric cooling is acceptable. Phase I deliverables include a
design review detailing expected device performance and a report
presenting Phase II plans for device fabrication and characterization.
The design review should specify device responsivity versus wavelength
in the targeted spectral region, spanning at least one spectral octave.
In addition to the NEP and electronic bandwidth, the detector active
area should be defined to establish the device D*. Detector output power
 and saturation properties should be addressed. The final report should
describe device operational principles and limits, materials platforms
and fabrication techniques, and any required supporting electronics.
Experimental data demonstrating feasibility of the proposed design is
favorable.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Fabricate and test a prototype device
demonstrating the performance outlined in Phase I. Multiple devices
demonstrating detector uniformity (including the potential for arrayed
operation) are desirable. If not demonstrated in the prototype
fabrication, a clear path toward scalable fabrication should be
identified. The Technology Readiness Level to be reached is 5: Component
 and\/or bread-board validation in relevant environment. &amp;nbsp;At
the completion of Phase II, the prototype device(s) will be delivered to
 a laboratory of DARPA\u2019s specification for characterization and
integration with optical frequency comb sources. The final device should
 be adequately packaged and integrated with all relevant supporting
electronics for delivery to and operation by the test verification
facility. Guidance for device operation should be provided for test
facility personnel.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:
The same physical motivations underlying defense and security
application of spectroscopic detection in the MWIR and LWIR spectral
regions are true for numerous commercial applications of the same
technology including environmental monitoring, toxic industrial chemical
 detection, and first responder safety and assessment. A key
specification for many commercial applications is the device SWaP
enabled by the elimination of cryo-cooling.Spectroscopic detection in
the MWIR and LWIR spectral regions, where fundamental molecular
vibration transitions occur, combined with key atmospheric transmission
windows, is critical for improved detection sensitivity of threat
explosives and chemical warfare species. Active standoff detection
schemes based on optical frequency comb technology, when paired with the
 detectors developed in this SBIR, hold great potential to exploit these
 fundamental physical aspects of molecular and atmospheric chemistry for
 improved detection limits while simultaneously achieving improved
chemical selectivity.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: Photodetector, MWIR, LWIR,

Systems&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Define new cyber techniques and develop
technologies for automatically generating and injecting realistic
vulnerabilities into large code bases for the purpose of testing and
evaluating cyber security tools and capabilities, and to enable novel
pedagogical tools such as customized capture- the-flag
competitions.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: There is a critical DoD need for
improved cyber defensive capabilities. The evaluation of cyber defensive
 security mechanisms is difficult and ad hoc. To compare the efficacy of
 different techniques, tools and technologies, analysts typically rely
on synthetic benchmarks that either present a sample of existing
vulnerabilities or a potpourri of synthetic test cases. Given the
limited availability of such benchmarks, cyber security mechanisms tune
their techniques to ensure success (high precision and recall). Ideally,
 evaluation should rely on automated mechanisms that can systematically
inject realistic vulnerabilities into arbitrary software programs with
enough understanding of the underlying computation to guide the
evaluation of a wide range of security mechanisms (e.g., dynamic verses
static analysis techniques). To achieve such program understanding, a
combination of techniques may be necessary. For example, targeted
symbolic execution may be used to discover program paths that could be
used to generate vulnerabilities (e.g., integer overflows). The programs
 paths (i.e., symbolic constraints) could then be modified using
information from formal methods (e.g., using SMT solvers) to generate
and inject new code, at the source-level or binary-level, that is
provably vulnerable (e.g., the system can prove that the generated
conditions along a specific program path can lead to an integer
overflow). The code may then be obfuscated, using previously learned bug
 patterns, to appear similar to native vulnerable code. Goal-directed
branch enforcement may be used to select only the relevant conditions
required to reach a specific program path.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Conduct a
feasibility study to determine innovative cyber techniques and
mechanisms that are capable of automatically generating and injecting
realistic vulnerabilities to real-world applications written in C or
C++. Design, prototype, and evaluate a concept system for automatic
generation and insertion of vulnerability test cases using a single
vulnerability class (e.g., integer overflows) and support a small set of
 vulnerability hiding techniques (e.g., masquerade as incomplete integer
 overflow). The Phase I final report shall include a test methodology
and success criteria for the technology.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Further
develop the initial Phase I results to expand the scale of code that can
 be ingested, increase the number of vulnerability classes supported,
and develop additional hiding techniques. The prototype will support
multiple techniques for testing the efficacy of vulnerability detection
techniques (e.g., add non-fix point loops for static analysis tools,
crypto for symbolic execution engines, input checks against fuzzing).
Support of at least one additional language (e.g., Java) will be
explored, with initial proof-of-concept capability developed.
Demonstrate the resulting prototype in accordance with the success
criteria developed in Phase I. The Phase I final report shall include
test results and a software prototype.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: The commercial sector has concerns with the effectiveness
of their cyber defensive capabilities and understands the requirement
for security mechanisms that can automatically be tuned and aid in the
evaluation of their cyber defensive technologies, tools, and systems to
provide an effective defense against their cyber enemies. Commercial
benefits include increased cyber warfare protection of critical
infrastructure environments (e.g., nuclear, electrical, transportation,
etc.). As part of Phase III, the developed system should be transitioned
 into an enterprise level tool that can be used to evaluate third-party
vulnerability detection mechanisms. The DoD and the commercial world
have similar challenges with respect to maintaining the integrity of
their cyber computing and communications infrastructure. Thus, the
resulting cyber security techniques and technologies are directly
transitionable to the DoD for use by the services within the laboratory
environment (e.g., Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SSC)
Pacific's Combined Test Bed) or a simulated operational
environment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: Cyber defensive security

antennas. By the end of Phase II of the program, the ADCs should have a

 radio frequency (RF) signals to the digital domain where the underlying
 information can be processed using digital signal processing is a
critical aspect of many DoD electronics systems. A specific example are
phased array antenna systems, where high speed analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) enable the RF frequency band selection and RF beam
steering to be performed using flexible and adaptive digital signal
processing.Recently, great advances have been made in high sample rate
(&amp;gt;10 GS\/s), yet energy efficient ADCs [1-3], dramatically
improving the well-known Walden figure-of-merit (FOM). Yet, improvements
 in dynamic range, analog bandwidth and especially power consumption are
 needed for these converters.&amp;nbsp;To meet the needs of the DoD,
this solicitation seeks high-sample rate ADCs that can meet the
specifications of an ENOB greater than 6 bits, conversion rate faster
than 40 GS\/s, analog bandwidth greater than 20 GHz and power
consumption less than 500 mW by the end of Phase II of the program.
Designs may use digitally-assisted or other methods to improve
performance. Especially of interest are ADC implementations that have
beneficial physics based scaling in advanced CMOS technology nodes of 32

government to characterize the chip, use the chip in an application or
incorporate the data converter design and layout into a larger
integrated circuit.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: In the
emerging 5G standard for wireless handsets, phased arrays are expected
to supply the spatial filtering needed to massively increase the number
of handsets supported by a single base station. Digital phased arrays
would further add to the flexibility and number of simultaneous users
(handsets) but further increases in ADC sample rate and bandwidth are
required for digital phased arrays to emerge at 5G.Much like the Phase
III commercial communications application, high-sample rate ADCs for
DoD\/Military applications are of great importance. Multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) radio frequency systems are an effective method
for in-theatre communications. These ADCs are a crucial component to
breaking through the limitations of current MIMO systems to create MIMO
systems supporting a greatly increased number of carriers and thus
communications bandwidth.In order to reach the goals of future
communications systems, Phase III ADC metrics are as follows:Power

Sensors&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate a conformal, thin, broadband and
 rapid optical beam steering device without
gimbals.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: There is a critical DoD need for a new
class of broadband, random access electro-optic sensors on lightweight,
airborne platforms. A conformal, thin, broadband and rapid steering beam
 steering device would overcome the usual, disadvantages of traditional
optical systems and electro-optical devices beam steering devices, which
 use heavy and power-hungry gimbals and optical components making large
mechanical motions. Non mechanical optical beam steering devices have
been demonstrated. Most use electrically- controlled optical diffraction
 to steer the optical beam. These devices operate over a narrow
wavelength band, since the diffraction induced steering angle depends
sensitively on the wavelength of light. These narrowband devices are not
 suitable for broadband optical applications.Most passive electro-optic
(EO) systems are broadband. Also there are laser systems, such as
femto-second pulsed lasers and supercontinium lasers that are broadband
and will allow broadband light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems.
Providing broadband beam steering for lidar and passive EO systems could
 enable new LIDAR capabilities using these super continuum lasers, and
new passive EO systems capability.As a baseline this effort will require
 operation in either the near IR wavelength region or the mid IR
wavelength region. The proposed effort should discuss extending this
capability to the visible and to either the NIR region or MWIR region,
which ever band is not covered by the baseline approach.Threshold
performance objectives are a 10 cm diameter aperture, a 60 degree field
of steering in both angular dimensions, &amp;gt; 75% optical
transmission efficiency , broadband operation over at least 10 percent
bandwidth, beam quality no worse than 3 times diffraction limit, and
&amp;lt; 1 msec beam steering time. It is desire able to exceed these
goals if possible. It is desirable to keep physical size small, with the
 beam steerer no deeper than the diameter of the clear aperture beam
steering device. A key aspect of the approach is that the beam steering
concept must be compatible with conformal windows on aircraft (i.e.
windows that conform to the airframe surface). Beam steering approaches
should be capable of operating bi-directionally, that is, as optical
transmitters and receivers.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Determine feasibility of
possible EO beam steering approaches and evaluate their performance. The
 Phase I effort should result in (1) detailed physical optics simulation
 of light propagation through the component(s), (2) assessment of the
beam steering dynamic behavior and electrical properties, and (3)
preliminary evaluation of the expected size, weight, and power
consumption of a prototype implementation.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II:
Demonstrate the Phase I concept via laboratory brassboard experiments,
and develop a preliminary design of a device for field experiments. In
Phase II, a Phase I concept will be reduced to practice and performance
validated in a laboratory setting. The experiments conducted should
result in empirical and\/or analytic knowledge that will be used in the
preliminary prototype design effort. The laboratory brassboard may not
directly meet the desired threshold objectives, but should at a minimum
provide characterization data and demonstrate by analysis that the
performance objectives can be met. The preliminary design should focus
on a demonstration system which could be utilized in a field experiment
and would directly meet the performance objectives. Phase II
deliverables include: (1) laboratory brassboard design, (2) report of
brassboard experiment results, (3) preliminary design package for field
test device.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: A Phase III
system could be applied to a number of commercial applications,
including: 1) LIDAR measurements of wind velocities, aerosol
characterization, and terrain mapping, 2) compact surveillance systems
in security applications. A commercially focused Phase III effort would
choose a viable commercial use and build a prototype system optimized
for that application.The DoD currently uses a large number of broadband
EO systems, and active EO systems (e.g. LIDAR) are increasingly of
interest as well. The use of optical systems such as these is limited by
 the need for a turret to house the beam director. This protrusion
causes aerodynamic drag that limits range and speed of the platform.
Additionally, the wake turbulence can limit the useful speed and
field-of-regard regime of the sensor systems. A Phase III effort would
focus on increasing the TRL level of the technology to a point that is
compatible with an airborne demonstration on a relevant military air
platform. The effort would include any necessary component technology
development, but primarily be a detailed design, integration and test
phase. Phase III would include a final test and evaluation of the beam
steerer with both an active EO system and a broadband passive EO
sensor.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: beam steering, electro-optics, remote

        "description": "TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Electronics, SensorsThe
technology within this topic is restricted under the International
Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), which controls the export and import
of defense-related material and services. Offerors must disclose any
proposed use of foreign nationals, their country of origin, and what
tasks each would accomplish in the statement of work in accordance with
section 5.4.c.(8) of the solicitation.&amp;nbsp;OBJECTIVE: Develop
conformal antennas for a medium-caliber projectile. Develop capability
to survive gun launch environment. Improve target angle rate error.
Improve performance of aperture-limited antennas. Demonstrate
breadboard-level seeker functionality.&amp;nbsp;DESCRIPTION: The DARPA
MAD-FIRES program seeks to use a medium-caliber guided projectile to
engage maneuvering threats. Current projectile technologies have been
demonstrated in flight maneuver, but only recently have advances in
electronics and gun survivability opened the possibility of
projectile-based seekers. One possible seeker type is RF seekers.
Current RF systems require apertures larger than projectile diameter for
 target tracking in terminal engagement.A novel approach is needed for
achieving sufficient gain at small diameter to enable medium-caliber RF
seekers. The alternative solution of command-guidance from ground radar
places significant accuracy requirements on that radar, which becomes
prohibitive for very long-range acquisitions. Optical sensors offer high
 accuracy, but are limited in range and require hot targets or daylight
illumination. RF seekers are the primary candidate for maturation.DARPA
seeks a novel antenna and seeker approach that will allow successful
antenna integration on a mediumcaliber projectile. The antennas must
reside within the outer mold line of a medium-caliber projectile and
survive gun launch and ballistic fly out. The antenna should provide
sufficient gain in the forward direction to track targets during fly out
 and terminal engagement. The antennas must support accurate measurement
 of line of sight to target for terminal phase guidance.This RF seeker
shall provide a higher Pk than existing approaches, which will benefit
the DoD and the warfighter by fewer shots required per target, lower
cost per intercept, and greater survivability of the defended
asset.&amp;nbsp;PHASE I: Develop and design antennas for the MAD-FIRES
projectile, simulate performance for configuration selection, and trade
size and shape against performance to allow antenna selection trades for
 projectile integration. Analysis should reveal the antenna performance
characteristics in a relevant environment across frequency and angle of
approach to target. The proposer shall further the proof of concept
study by evaluating component survivability during launch up to
performing shock testing to simulate various representative launch
loads. A final proposed design with a discussion of trades and details
of expected performance is expected at the completion of Phase
I.&amp;nbsp;PHASE II: Complete a detailed antenna design for the
MAD-FIRES projectile culminating in a critical design review of the
concept. Upon successful review, fabricate prototype antennas for
potential live-fire testing. Measure performance of seeker in hardware
demonstration and use results to update error model and refine
algorithm, as necessary. Phase II deliverables will include: 1)
fabricated prototype seeker and platform mock-up, 2) quantified results
of performance measurements taken during hardware demo, and 3)
updated\/validated seeker error model, suitable for use in 6DOF
simulations. The Phase II final report should describe the seeker
design, the measured performance and the final seeker error
model.&amp;nbsp;PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Small, survivable,
lightweight antennas and receiver hardware will enable unique commercial
 applications for systems requiring highly directional and robust
receiver solutions such as commercial satellites, relocatable
communications nodes, and vehicle ranging sensors for autonomous
vehicles. Inclusion on small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) would
create selectable, directional datalinks improving link margin for mesh
networking and reducing power requirements for downlinks. This
technology provides design flexibility to all size constrained systems
such as UAVs and satellites. The ability to position antennas
longitudinally (lengthwise) while achieving the same performance as a
traditional front facing antenna provides many more options for antenna
placement and orientation to optimize overall miniaturization and
compact system design.Military applications will focus on the DARPA
MAD-FIRES platform, supporting the government system analysis that will
inform the MAD-FIRES contractor concepts. Additional applications will
include C-RAM and strategic defense missions, including adaptations for
projectile and missile host platforms.&amp;nbsp;KEYWORDS: Medium caliber

        "description": "\n\tThe objective of this Funding Opportunity
Announcement (FOA) is to support the development of a point of care
(POC) device for the diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD) including
HbSS, HbSC, HbS\/&amp;szlig;thal0 in infants and young children in
low-income and low-resource settings.\n\n\tThe genetic disorders of
hemoglobin are the most common monogenic diseases. Approximately 5% of
the world&amp;rsquo;s population carries trait genes for hemoglobin
disorders, primarily sickle cell disease and the thalassemias. Although
these disorders occur mainly in tropical regions, population migration
has spread these diseases to most countries. The health burden of
hemoglobin disorders can be effectively reduced through management and
prevention programs.\n\n\tThe World Health Organization (WHO) has
declared SCD a public health priority. The greatest burden of SCD is in
sub-Saharan Africa, where 75% of the 300,000 annual global births of
affected children live, and estimates suggest that 50-80% of these
patients will die before reaching adulthood. The WHO estimates that 70%
of SCD deaths in Africa are preventable with simple, cost-effective
interventions such as early identification of SCD patients by newborn
screening (NBS) and the subsequent provision of comprehensive
care.\n\n\tSCD can be diagnosed in newborns and infants as well as older
 persons by methods such as zone electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing
electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or DNA
analysis. However, these methods all require expensive equipment and are
 performed by highly trained laboratory technologists. On the other
hand, solubility testing methods such as Sickledex and concentrated
phosphate buffer are simple and inexpensive, but are not appropriate for
 screening purposes due to interfering factors. Currently there are no
simple and inexpensive screening tests for SCD that are free of
interferences or can differentiate patients with sickle cell trait
(HbAS) from sickle cell disease conditions (HbSS, HbSC and HbS
&amp;szlig;-thalassemias).\n\n\tDue to advances in the diagnosis and
management of SCD, there has been a reduction of morbidity and mortality
 in developed countries. There is evidence that neonatal screening for
SCD based on timely diagnostic testing including parental education and
comprehensive care, markedly reduces morbidity and mortality from the
disease in infancy and early childhood.&amp;nbsp; In rural parts of
Africa, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa where SCD is most prevalent,
many women do not give birth in medical facilities. Consequently, a SCD
diagnosis is rarely made before the age of 2-3 years and many
undiagnosed children die in early infancy due to potentially treatable
diseases such as meningitis, pneumonia or acute anemia. Barriers to
screening for SCD include the need for sophisticated and expensive
equipment and the training of qualified laboratory technologists both of
 which are not practical due to limited health care fiscal resources in
those regions.\n\n\tTraditional neonatal screening for SCD would not be
an effective diagnostic intervention in these low resource settings due
to the high number of out of hospital births. A more pragmatic use of
limited health care dollars in low income countries would involve the
widespread integration of highly sensitive and specific POC testing
during the infant&amp;rsquo;s\/child&amp;rsquo;s first acute care visit
at a local medical clinic. The implementation of a low-cost and accurate
 POC diagnostic device would overcome the current barriers. To
accomplish this, the initial approach will be to test children for SCD
at the time of acute illness, and if the child is found to have the
disease, s\/he will be given appropriate acute therapy and integrated
into the local\/national SCD healthcare system for longer term care to
reduce the risk of some future complications. Once the test is developed
 and evaluated at the medical clinic level, POC testing could be
expanded to local geographies to provide early diagnosis to a much
larger group of children. In either the acute medical or local community
 setting, our current understanding of the disease would allow for
molecular or biochemical technologies to be explored to distinguish
normal, carrier and disease states.\n\n\tA POC device should
efficiently, inexpensively and rapidly diagnose a patient with
SCD.&amp;nbsp; POC testing is currently defined as testing performed
close to the patient, at the time care is required.&amp;nbsp; The result
 should enable a clinical decision to be made, leading to clinical
action (e.g., treatment) if required.&amp;nbsp; For POC testing to be
effective, it should allow for timely intervention that leads to an
improved health outcome.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tAccepted technologies in this
program will provide (1) high specificity to detect HbS, (2) high
sensitivity by identifying HbS in the presence of elevated fetal
hemoglobin (HbF), and (3) capacity to distinguish patients with sickle
trait (heterozygous HbAS) from those with SCD (homozygous HbSS,
heterozygous HbSC and HbS &amp;szlig;-thalassemias). Development of a
POC device based on such technologies will allow basic health care
workers to perform the assay in the field and to quickly and
appropriately manage those patients with SCD.\n\n\tSpecifications:
Specific requirements for an appropriate POC device
are:\n\n\t\n\t\tLow-cost, including materials and
reagents.\n\t\n\t\tCompact, low-weight, portable size that can fit in a
back pack or handbag (no large electricity-dependent instruments needed
to perform the test).\n\t\n\t\tSensitive (very low false-negative rates)
 and specific (very low false-positive rates), and accurate when there
are co-existing conditions such as nutritional anemia (e.g., iron
deficiency), and parasitemia due to malaria.\n\t\n\t\tUser friendly
design and instructions for use (simple to perform by persons with
little training).\n\t\n\t\tMinimal and either non-invasive (e.g., buccal
 swab) or minimally invasive (e.g., finger or heel stick to obtain 2-4
drops of blood sample) specimen procurement.\n\t\n\t\tRapid analysis at
the first visit.\n\t\n\t\tRobust use without the need for special
storage, e.g., provide results within minutes to hours as opposed to
days; and able to perform multiple tests in a
day.\n\t\n\t\tBattery-driven or solar-powered devices are especially
desirable.\n\t\n\t\tDevice should be operable in extreme temperatures
and humidity.\n\t\n\t\tMust provide significant improvement over the
currently used solubility test.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe current
solubility method has sensitivity of 45% and a positive predictive value
 of 33.3% (Okwi et al., 2010 (Clinics in Mother and Child Health,
7(1):1205-1210, 2010). Acceptable devices should provide values
exceeding at least 60% for each of these two parameters. The overall
diagnostic accuracy should exceed 90%.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe current
solubility test fails to detect HbS in persons with severe anemia
(Package Insert from the Sickledex&amp;reg; solubility test). The POC
device should overcome this limitation.\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tResearch
examples include, but are not limited to:\n\n\t\n\t\tLow-cost,
high-resolution, portable MRI that can be held adjacent to nail beds or
sclera to assess blood rheology.\n\t\n\t\tLow-cost, easy-to-use,
portable lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) POC blood test cassettes that
provide results at the time of testing and use highly specific
monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to sickle hemoglobin (HbS), normal adult
hemoglobin (HbA), and potentially HbF and
HbC.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tNucleic acid
amplification testing (NAAT) of saliva or blood combined with a simple,
compact, low-weight means of detection device.\n\t\n\t\tBlood Card
Technology that facilitates collection of specimens and reading on site
or at a &amp;ldquo;central&amp;rdquo; laboratory.\n\t\n\t\tDeveloping
hand-held self contained POC device to perform flow through
immunoassay.\n\t\n\t\tDigital microfluidics.\n\t\n\t\tLow-cost,
low-power, portable, hand-held connective PCR for analysis of
blood.\n\t\n\t\tDensity-based cell separation technique for blood
samples.\n\t\n\t\tLab-on-a-film: combines PCR and microarray
hybridization for analysis of blood or saliva samples.\n\t\n\t\tHandheld
 pipette (Millipore&amp;reg; Scepter) to analyze RBC morphology or a
selected biomarker.\n\t\n\t\tUse of cell phone or satellite phone
technology to analyze specimens and transmit data.\n\n\n\tPhase I
Activities:\n\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of the essential components of the
proposed technology.\n\t\n\t\tDemonstration of the feasibility of the
technology.\n\t\n\t\tCharacterization of the performance characteristics
 of the device including cross-reactivity, precision, specimen
collection and handling conditions, assay cut-off point(s) and accuracy
of the method.\n\t\n\t\tTest the device using a set of standards
acceptable to the US regulatory authorities under Premarket Notification
 (510k) or Premarket Approval (PMA).\n\t\n\t\tTest the device using
samples with known sickling disorders to demonstrate: (1) high
specificity to HbS and HbA; (2) high sensitivity by identifying HbS when
 there are co-existing conditions such as elevated HbF, severe anemia,
etc.\n\n\n\tPhase II Applications:\n\n\tPhase II applications are
required to include a steering committee consisting of appropriate
experts to provide oversight and critical evaluation of the clinical
development plan and its components.\n\n\tPhase II
Activities:\n\n\t\n\t\tTest the device in low resource settings using a
targeted subject population.\n\n\n\tPhase II and Fast-Track applicants
interested in pursuing clinical trials in low resource regions are
encouraged to contact the NHLBI program staff.\n",

Methods and Software",
        "description": "In the short term, this topic aims to 1) develop
 bioinformatic methods to integrate metabolite data across various
laboratory platforms and analytical technologies, including
liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), gas chromatography-mass
 spectrometry (GC-MS), and NMR; and 2) develop scalable software tool(s)
 to automate these methods for use by the cancer and overall public
health research communities. Valid and reliable data harmonization of
metabolomics data also builds a critical foundation for the longer term
goal of integration of metabolomics data with other \u2018omics data
(e.g., genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, etc.). The
development of methods to integrate a wide range of -omics data will
position the research community to better leverage existing data for the
 discovery of novel cancer biomarkers of etiology, diagnosis, and
prognosis.\nResponses to this topic are expected to address the
development of efficient bioinformatic methods to:\n1. Demonstrate
bioinformatic methods for the integration of metabolite data across
different laboratory platforms and analytical technologies with high
accuracy;\n2. Store metabolite data from the different data sources in
databases that can be easily used for data integration and quality
control protocols;\n3. Implement valid quality control (QC) checks;
and\n4. Appropriately secure data at each stage of transfer and
storage.\nAn essential task for each proposal is the development of
bioinformatic tools in the form of scalable software that can be used by
 the research community at-large to automate complex data integration
tasks for metabolomics data sources.\nPhase I activities should provide
evidence that metabolite data integration bioinformatic methods, using
identified metabolite data, have been effectively developed, can be
implemented across data inputs from diverse laboratory platforms and at
least two analytical technologies, and demonstrate readiness to proceed
to Phase II. Additionally, Phase I will be used to demonstrate the
framework for scalable software tool(s) that apply the bioinformatic
methods to automate the integration of metabolite data.\nPhase I
Activities and Deliverables\n\u2022 Establish a project team including
proven expertise in metabolomics analytical technologies, epidemiology,
biostatistics\/bioinformatics, and computer technology. Additionally, a
team including expertise in biochemistry\/clinical chemistry is
preferred.\n\u2022 Develop bioinformatic methods for metabolite data
integration for identified metabolites across data inputs from diverse
laboratory platforms and at least two analytical technologies
(preferably liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and\/or NMR).\n\u2022
Participate in the development of a collaboration agreement between the
offeror, NCI, and NCI-identified third party sources to access relevant
input data types for the proposed project. NCI staff will work with
established cohort studies and consortia to provide metabolomics data
(identified metabolite data) to successful offerors.\n\u2022 Develop
database formats that support the import and export of individual
datasets and \u201ccombined\u201d datasets, store structured data from
different sources of metabolite data, and are readily used for data
integration and QC protocols.\no Finalize database formats and
structure, data collection, transport and importation methods for
targeted Phase I data inputs.\n\u2022 Provide wireframes and user
workflows for the proposed Graphical User Interface (GUI) and software
functions that:\no Support the import and export of individual datasets
and \u201ccombined\u201d datasets;\no Implement, script or automate all
features and functions of the data integration tool(s);\no Conduct QC of
 \u201ccombined\u201d datasets.\n\u2022 Provide a report including a
detailed description and\/or technical documentation of the
following:\nPage 63\no Specific approach to metabolite data
integration;\no Specific approach to QC;\no Data standards for transfer
and importation of individual metabolite data and storage of individual
and \u201ccombined\u201d metabolite data;\no Data visualization,
feedback, and reporting systems for individual and \u201ccombined\u201d
metabolite data;\no Technology compatibility matrix for Phase I and
Phase II metabolomics data sources by laboratory platform, analytical
technology, and identified metabolites (Phase I) \/ unidentified
metabolite peaks (Phase II).\no Software tool(s);\no Transparent,
documented, and non-proprietary bioinformatic methods; and\no
Description of additional software and hardware required for use of the
tool.\no Finalized database formats and structure, data collection,
transport, and importation methods for targeted data inputs; and\no
Funds in budget to present Phase I findings and demonstrate the
wireframes and user workflows for the GUI and software functions to an
NCI evaluation panel.\n\u2022 Develop functional prototype software that
 integrates data from planned Phase I technology compatibility matrix
data sources using automated algorithms and methods.\n\u2022 Include
funds in the Phase I budget to present project deliverable and the
prototype software tools to an NCI panel for evaluation.\nPhase II
Activities and Deliverables\n\u2022 Expand the bioinformatic methods to
include unidentified metabolite peaks, in addition to identified
metabolite data, and demonstrate metabolite data integration across data
 inputs from diverse laboratory platforms and at least two analytical
technologies (preferably liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry
(LC-MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and\/or
NMR).\n\u2022 Participate in the development of a collaboration
agreement between the offeror, NCI, and NCI-identified third party
sources to access relevant input data types for the proposed project.
NCI staff will work with established cohort studies and consortia to
provide metabolomics data (identified metabolites and unidentified peak
data) to successful offerors that would serve to: 1) train and validate
the expanded bioinformatic methods; and 2) demonstrate the application
of these methods through scalable software to automate complex data
integration tasks for metabolomics data sources.\n\u2022 Demonstrate
usability of scalable software through the following:\no Beta-test and
finalize automated file transfer, database importation protocols,
metabolite data integration applications and reporting tools developed
in Phase I\no Develop beta-test, finalize, and demonstrate the GUI\no

Phase II technology compatibility matrix data sources using automated
algorithms and analytic methods\n\u2022 Conduct usability testing of the
 GUI elements of the metabolite data integration tool(s).\n\u2022
Develop systems documentation where applicable to support the software
and bioinformatic methods.\n\u2022 In the first year of the contract,
provide the program and contract officers with a letter(s) of commercial
 interest.\n\u2022 In the second year of the contract, provide the
program and contract officers with a letter(s) of commercial
commitment.",

        "topic_name": "Validation of Mobile Technologies for Clinical
Assessment, Monitoring &amp;amp; Intervention",
        "description": "Mobile health technologies have grown
exponentially in the past few years. The ubiquity of mobile phone use
provides a platform for health assessment, monitoring and interventions
previously unavailable to health research and clinical practice. The
penetration of mobile phone use, even in remote areas, provides a
vehicle for health care delivery to individuals with limited access to
care. Wireless sensor technologies have also rapidly expanded in
availability and function in the past few years. When paired with mobile
 devices, these sensor technologies provide real-time data on a variety
of image-based, physiological, behavioral, or environmental
variables.\nThe range of health research and clinical practice affected
by this technology revolution is quite broad. Preventive health
assessment and intervention applications for cancer associated
behavioral risk factors have increased dramatically. Mobile technologies
 have been developed for medical screening and diagnostic purposes,
providing low cost and portable diagnostic tools for use in rural and
underserved settings. Mobile technologies have also been used to support
 cancer survivorship care and improve chronic disease management for
cancer risk factors such as obesity and diabetes, allowing healthcare
providers to more intensively monitor patient status and intervene as
needed while providing patients a resource to more effectively
self-manage their disease.\nThe NCI Division of Cancer Control and
Population Sciences aims to reduce risk, incidence, and deaths from
cancer, as well as enhance the quality of life for cancer survivors.
Emerging mobile technologies provide an opportunity to support
innovation and progress towards NCI\u2019s mission of cancer prevention
&amp;amp; control by 1) improving quality or access &amp;amp; reducing
cost or burden of screening, diagnostic, treatment and follow-up care
for cancer and associated chronic diseases; and 2) improving lifestyle
intervention efficacy and scalability for cancer related behavioral risk
 factors. The number of mobile and wireless health tools grows each
year, but the majority of these tools have been inadequately validated
in clinical research and practice. Adoption of these technologies in
support of cancer treatment and survivorship requires more evaluation in
 clinical and behavioral settings. This topic is not intended to support
 new technology development, but instead to clinically validate
promising but insufficiently tested tools for cancer prevention
&amp;amp; control.\nProject Goals\nThe purpose of this topic is to
support validation of mobile technologies for clinical assessment,
screening, diagnostics, monitoring or intervention delivery focused on
cancer prevention, and control objectives. Examples of technologies may
include monitoring or diagnostic sensors &amp;amp; paired smartphone
applications, cancer treatment or survivor care planning &amp;amp;
remote monitoring systems, behavioral analytics and decision support
systems, or intervention delivery systems. In the short term, the topic
aims to develop research evidence to support adoption of innovative
mobile technologies which support cancer prevention, treatment, disease
management, or survivorship. Longer term goals are the integration of
these technologies in clinical assessment, care &amp;amp; intervention
delivery within health systems, accountable care organizations (ACO),
and health research.\nWithin the context of this topic, "mobile" health
technologies are defined broadly to include anyhealth technologies that
wirelessly transmit data and that are intended for portable use. The
early focus of these technologies has primarily been devices worn on or
carried by the individual throughout the day. However, devices that
provide a level of portability not previously available (e.g. smaller
and more portable version of a diagnostic scanner that transmits data
wirelessly to the healthcare provider) is consistent with the scope of
this initiative.\nAs noted previously, this topic in not intended to
support the development of new technologies. Some additional programming
 may be required to customize or integrate the technology into the
target clinical, health system, or related software environments, but
these efforts should be sufficiently limited to retain a focus on
validation and expanded evidence of commercial potential and value for
health assessment or outcomes.\nResponses to this topic are expected to
address one or more of the following areas of mobile\/wireless health
research;\n1) Evaluation of the reliability of mobile screening,
diagnostic, assessment or monitoring technologies &amp;amp; methods\n2)
Evaluation of the validity of mobile screening, diagnostic, assessment
or monitoring technologies &amp;amp; methods\n3) Evaluation of the
efficacy and effectiveness of mobile technology and systems for
behavioral analytics, clinical decision support, or intervention
delivery.\nAlthough extension of existing usability, acceptability, and
feasibility of the mobile\/wireless health tool may be considered as
secondary research questions, they should not be the primary objectives
of applications in response to this topic.\nThis topic will prioritize
research that will rapidly validate existing mobile technologies in
clinical care &amp;amp; monitoring, clinical decision support or
intervention applications. It is anticipated that the clinical
screening, diagnostic, assessment, and monitoring technologies will
provide the "gold standard" comparator for the new mobile or wireless
tool being evaluated, but additional clinical measures may be needed to
validate the new tool. However, in some instances, novel measures may
not directly translate to existing clinical \u201cgold standard\u201d
measures\/technologies, and alternative validation approaches may be
required. Validation analyses could include but are not limited to
agreement rates, sensitivity\/specificity, and receiver operating curves
 (ROC). Research evaluating the reliability of the technology is
consistent with this topic. For outcome monitoring purposes, assessment
of sensitivity to change are also consistent with this topic.\n\u25cb
Validation of mobile technologies and systems for intervention delivery
or decision support are particularly encouraged. Dependent on the
research question and technology under evaluation, research designs may
include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), series of single case
designs, optimization designs (e.g. factorial, sequential) or
quasi-experimental approaches such as interrupted time series and
stepped-wedge designs. Projects that integrate and automate ongoing
validation and\/or outcomes evaluation (e.g. automated RCTs) in the
commercial product are particularly encouraged. For additional
information on evaluation of mHealth technologies please see
(http:\/\/www.ajpmonline.org\/article\/S0749-3797(13)00277-8\/abstract).
 Primary clinical or behavioral outcomes may be supplemented with
cost-effectiveness analyses where appropriate.\nMilestones for
Direct-to-Phase II Technologies\nAll proposals submitted under this
topic must provide evidence that specific mobile technology or systems
development milestones have been achieved to demonstrate readiness for a
 Direct-to-Phase II contract. These milestones will be evaluated in
addition to standard review criteria for all submissions.\n1. Provide
evidence that a working prototype, including all major functional
components of the technology, is ready for formal validation in Phase II

commercial products that do not have adequate validity or efficacy
support are also encouraged.\n2. Provide documentation that the product

        "topic_name": "An Electronic Platform for Cognitive Assessment
in Cancer Patients",
        "description": "Persistent cognitive deficits are a frequent
complaint of the increasing population of cancer survivors, particularly
 those who have undergone chemotherapy. Cancer patients experience both
acute and chronic cognitive effects during both the treatment and
survivorship phases of the cancer control continuum. One significant
barrier to assessing cognitive symptoms in cancer populations is the
inability to administer a brief, scientifically valid cognitive battery,
 either remotely or within a clinical visit.\nThe current gold standard
in the field is standardized neuropsychological tests. These tests were
devised for the purpose of diagnosing severe and focal cognitive
impairments, such as stroke, and present consistent research challenges.
 First, they lack sensitivity to less severe, but still debilitating
cognitive impairments such as those observed in chemotherapy patients.
Second, they lack specificity; it is difficult to tell which cognitive
function is responsible for poor performance. Third, they lack
repeatability; tests were designed for a single diagnostic
administration, and thus it is difficult or impossible to administer the
 same test multiple times over the course of a treatment protocol.
Fourth, most such tests were originally devised decades ago and thus
make no contact with the considerable advances in cognitive and
neuro-scientific theory over the last thirty years. Fifth, a trained
neuropsychologist must be on site to administer the test, pushing up the
 costs of research and limiting use in the clinical oncology setting.
Therefore, there is a substantial unmet need for a suite of computerized
 cognitive tests, based on contemporary cognitive psychology and
neuroscience research, designed for repeated testing, that could be
easily administered remotely.\nProject Goals\nThe goal of this project
is to develop a scalable, secure, and privacy-compliant software system,
 and tools to support computerized administration of brief cognitive
assessments specifically focused on measuring the subtle cognitive
changes associated with cancer and cancer treatment.\nThe software
system must support assessments of basic cognitive processes that are
repeatable and can be remotely administered across diverse settings
(i.e., clinic or home) using multiple technology platforms (i.e., PC,
tablet, smartphone). In addition, the system must support
provider\/researcher portal functionality for patient management
functions including (but not limited to) adding patients, ordering and
scheduling assessments, automated scoring, visualization and triage of
results, and standards based data reporting to third party systems.
Where appropriate and relevant for project goals, the software system
should integrate measures available via third party systems such as
PROMIS, NIH Toolbox, and NeuroQOL rather than validate duplicative
resources.\nIn Phase I, offerors will establish a multidisciplinary team
 for validation\/evaluation of the proposed platform, provide
documentation that appropriate software-based assessments have been
developed, as well scoring protocols in the minimum specified cognitive
domains. A report providing a detailed description, visual design, and
technical documentation will be required, as well as a functional
prototype. Phase I will also include client side user testing. Lastly,
documentation detailing output reporting systems feasibility will be
included in the demonstration of the final prototype to an NCI
evaluation panel via webinar. In Phase II, offerors will evaluate
specific IT customization requirements, test and finalize client,
server, and data systems, including technical documentation for the
software\nsystems application programming interface. Usability testing
and support documentation will be provided, and submission of a research
 plan and presentation to NCI will be delivered via webinars.\nThe short
 term goal of this topic is to\n1) Develop innovative software systems
which support brief, remotely administered patient assessments and
scoring of cognitive processes affected by cancer and cancer
treatment\n2) Develop paired provider portal tools for remote
administration and management of patient assessments and results\n3)
Conduct user testing of the client side assessment tools and modes of
administration\n4) Conduct clinical validation of the cancer cognitive
assessment instruments delivered via the software system\nLonger term
goals include the integration of these software tools in clinical
assessment and monitoring in both oncology research and care settings,
with the eventual goal of embedding assessment results into electronic
medical records used in health systems and accountable care
organizations (ACO).\nThis topic aims to support customized development
and\/or integration of information technology into the cognitive
assessment process. The primary focus will be brief administration and
scoring of assessments of cognitive processes affected by cancer and
cancer treatments. Minimum cognitive domains to be assessed include:
Attention, executive function, working memory, verbal abilities,
visuospatial ability, motor function, and processing speed.\nIn addition
 to technical development, this topic is intended to support validation
(e.g., efficacy and\/or effectiveness) of the assessment battery,
specifically with respect to reliably detecting cognitive changes in
cancer populations.\nPhase I Activities and Deliverables\n\u2022
Establish a project team including personnel with training and research
experience in cognitive psychology, neuroscience and\/or
neuropsychology, clinical oncology, implementation, and statistical
methods for validation\/evaluation as appropriate for the proposed
technology platform.\n\u2022 In addition, technical personnel should
have experience in Health IT software standards (i.e., privacy,
security, health data exchange protocols, etc.), electronic health
records, cross platform client side software development, scalable sever
 side software development, data visualization, and systems architecture
 that will effectively address all objectives of the current
topic.\n\u2022 Provide documentation that software-based assessments

 and evidence.\n\u2022 Provide a report including detailed description
of proposed assessments (including relevant modification for electronic
administration) and scoring protocols planned for Phase I and Phase II

        "topic_name": "Technologies for Differential Isolation of
Exosomes and Oncosomes",
        "description": "Both normal and cancer tissues shed exosomes and
 other vesicles into body fluids. Tissue-shed exosomes are found in
several body fluids including amniotic fluid, breast milk,
bronchoalveolar fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, malignant ascites, plasma,
saliva and urine. Exosomes collected from the blood and other body
fluids of patients diagnosed with various cancers were shown to contain
tumor suppressors, phosphoproteins, proteases, growth factors, bioactive
 lipids, mutant oncoproteins, oncogenic transcripts, microRNA and
genomic DNA fragments. Exosomal trafficking and reciprocal exchange of
molecular information among different organs and cell types were
reported to contribute to cell-to-cell communication, horizontal
cellular transformation, cellular reprogramming, functional alterations,
 regulation of immune response, and metastasis. In functional studies,
exosomes shed by tumors, referred to as oncosomes, were reported to
activate normal epithelial cells to form tumors, while exosomes from
healthy individuals appear to have anti-tumor characteristics.
Comparative molecular profiling of normal tissue-derived exosomes and
tumor-derived oncosomes in blood and other body fluids may therefore
offer a non-invasive or minimally invasive way to assess carcinogenesis;
 cancer risk; tumor initiation, promotion, development and progression,
metastasis in tissues; survival and treatment response, and the
knowledge gained may lead to better cancer prevention\/care\/control.The
 major bottleneck for using oncosomes in cancer research or clinical
care is in obtaining enriched preparations of oncosomes from body
fluids. Existing technologies are based on centrifugation,
precipitation\/centrifugation or affinity purification, which are labor
intensive, time consuming, or biased because they are based on known
exosomal markers. Furthermore, existing approaches impose significant
stresses on these vesicles and potentially compromise their biological
integrity and viability for various downstream uses.&amp;nbsp;
Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to accelerate the development of
 technologies for differential isolation and enrichment of
tissue-derived exosomes and tumor-derived oncosomes which will be useful
 for comparative molecular profiling or therapeutic purposes. Given the
potential of exosomes and oncosomes for basic research and clinical
applications, proposed technology platforms should be capable of
processing a large number of samples each with significant volumes and
be useful for profiling multiple body fluids from multiple cancer types.
 Of further interest are technology proposals amenable to low-cost
production, appropriate for handling large number of samples, and useful
 for profiling multiple body fluids from multiple cancer types to
conduct molecular analysis studies in population
science.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe biospecimen sources for exosomes or oncosomes
isolation and enrichment can be blood, plasma, serum, urine, saliva,
amniotic fluid, breast milk, bronchoalveolar lavage, cerebrospinal
fluid, peritoneal fluid, malignant ascites or other types of body fluids
 or effusions. In Phase I, the technology development should focus on
isolation and enrichment and obtaining distinct preparations of exosomes
 and oncosomes. In Phase II, the focus should be adopting the technology
 developed in phase I to isolating and enriching exosomes and oncosomes
from multiple body fluids in multiple cancer types.\n&amp;nbsp;\nProject
 Goals\nThe goal of this contract proposal is 1) to support the
development of large scale (capable of handling a large volume of a body
 fluid) or high-throughput (capable of isolating and exosomes or
oncosomes from large number of samples in a finite time) technologies
for differential isolation of tissue-specific exosomes and tumor-derived
 oncosomes from any body fluid(s), and 2) to obtain enriched, distinct
preparations useful for downstream comparative molecular profiling or
therapeutic use. Applicants must propose to develop an efficient and
cost effective platform for complete isolation and segregation of
extracellular vesicle populations, with particular emphasis on yielding
pure exosome or oncosome populations that are morphologically and
functionally intact. The technology should preferably establish
automated workflows and reduce human intervention to obtain enriched
distinct preparations of exosomes and oncosomes.\n&amp;nbsp;\nTo apply
for this topic, offerors should have a proof-of-concept prototype
platform with demonstrated capability for isolating exosomes from
complex solutions. Preference will be given for proposals with
demonstrated capability for further isolating oncosomes from the general
 exosome population. They should demonstrate sufficient expertise and
necessary resources for robustly characterizing captured oncosomes, and
verifying persistence of their biological
integrity.\n&amp;nbsp;\nApplicants are required to obtain distinct
preparations of exosomes and oncosomes, which originated in a specific
tissue\/tumor, from routinely collected fresh or archived body fluids.
They should demonstrate integrity, quantity and reproducibility of
isolation and separation using physicochemical and functional studies.
This solicitation is not intended for developing technologies for
molecular profiling exosomal or oncosomal cargo.\n&amp;nbsp;\nPhase I
Activities and
Deliverables\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Develop a technology for differential isolation of exosomes with highly
 selective isolation of oncosomes from the exosome population, which
originated in a specific tissue, from body fluid(s) collected from
cancer patients (e.g., breast, prostate, colon, lung or brain).
High-throughput capacity or large scale abilities must be sufficient for
 adoption in clinical workflows (therefore demonstrate capability for
processing at least 50 sample in 8 h or 10 mL of clinical fluid specimen
 in &amp;lt;1
hour)\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Demonstrate that the technology can obtain distinct preparations of
exosomes and oncosomes from the routinely collected fresh\/archived body
 fluids, and yields sufficient quantity for downstream analysis.
Specifically, demonstrate sufficient yield of nucleic acids for
NGS\/qPCR and proteins for
LC-MS\/MS\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

minimal training for new
users\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Demonstrate that the reproducibility is &amp;gt;90% and yield is
&amp;gt;70%\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

physicochemical methods (Transmission electron microscopy, AFM, dynamic
light scattering,
immunostaining\/immunofluorescence)\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Benchmark the developed technology against at least 2 current
techniques (e.g. centrifugation, density gradient, immunocapture,
size-based filtration, etc.) and demonstrate comparable purity and yield
 from clinically appropriate sample sizes for the specific bodily
fluid.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Deliver to NCI the SOPs for exosome\/oncosome isolation and the data
from physicochemical characterization that demonstrates the quality of
the isolated exosomes\/oncosomes.\nPhase II Activities and
Deliverables\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Adapt the technology to multiple body fluids (i.e., stored or freeze
thawed) with varying
complexity\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Demonstrate that the isolated exosomes\/oncosomes are morphologically
intact by physicochemical methods (Transmission electron microscopy,
AFM, dynamic light scattering, immunostaining\/immunofluorescence), and
functionally active in in vitro systems (transmission of information
from exosomes\/oncosomes to cells in culture and\/or
co-culture).&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

        "topic_name": "Predictive Biomarkers of Adverse Reactions to
Radiation Treatment",
        "description": "Radiotherapy is an important definitive and
palliative treatment modality for millions of patients with cancer and
is used alone or in combination with drug therapy. However, a variety of
 patient, tumor, and treatment-related factors will influence its
outcome. Significant advances in delivery and distribution of dose for
radiotherapy have been made over the years. Currently, treatment
decisions in radiotherapy\/radiochemotherapy are primarily defined by
disease stage, tumor location, treatment volume, and patient
co-morbidities, together with general guidelines concerning normal
tissue tolerance for surrounding organs. However, treatment planning
does not take into account an individual patient\u2019s, or a cohort of
patients\u2019 sensitivities to this important modality of treatment.
This is an important limitation in personalized care, as there are known
 variations in individual patient normal tissue sensitivities to
radiation, but treatments are based on population normal tissue
complication probabilities. As molecularly targeted therapy is being
integrated into radiotherapy and chemotherapy, selecting the \u201cright
 type of treatment\u201d is critical to improve outcomes.\nA substantial
 number of patients treated with radiotherapy suffer from severe to
life-threatening adverse acute effects as well as debilitating late
reactions. Acute side effects (e.g. skin reactions, mucositis, etc.) are
 often dose limiting, but may be reversible in contrast to the late
effects such as fibrosis in the lung, telangiectasia, and atrophy, which
 are irreversible and progressive. A biomarker-based test that can
predict the risk of developing severe radiotherapy-related complications
 will allow delivery of suitable alternative treatments. Such
stratification may also allow dose escalation to the tumor in less
sensitive patients. However, discovery, development, and validation of
predictive biomarkers of radiation hypersensitivity are challenging,
particularly due to a low incidence of normal tissue complications in
the clinic, the need for long-term studies for predicting late effects,
and the combination of chemotherapy with radiation as standard of care
for most tumors.\nProject Goals\nThe goal of this contract topic is to
identify, develop, and validate a simple, cost-effective biomarker(s) to
 rapidly assess inter-individual differences in radiation sensitivity
and predict early and late complications among patients with cancer
prior to radiation therapy.\nA predictive biomarker of individual
radiation sensitivity can measure any biological changes in response to
absorbed ionizing radiation, which is able to predict imminent normal
tissue injury prior to radiotherapy and help determine radiotherapy
suitability and outcomes. Radiation biomarkers are an emerging and
rapidly developing area of research, with potential applications in
predicting individual radiosensitivity, predicting severity of normal
tissue injury among patients, assessing and monitoring of tumor response
 to radiation therapy as well as in estimating dose to accidentally
radiation-exposed individuals. The purpose of this contract topic is to
develop a radiation biomarker(s) to specifically identify and exclude
likely \u201cover responders\u201d prior to radiotherapy in order to
avoid severe complications and to refer them for alternative treatment
modalities.\nA variety of radiation biomarkers have already been
explored or are currently under development at different technology
readiness levels (TRLs) at different government agencies and programs.
This contract topic intends to leverage on these advances. These assays
include but are not limited to (i) fibroblast clonogenic assay, (ii)
measurement of DNA damage foci, (iii) damaged base metabolites, (iv)
various types of chromosome aberrations studied in different phases of
cell cycles, serum biomarkers, gene expression changes, (v) protein and
microRNA expression changes, (vi) and genetic tests.\nTo be of practical
 value in the clinic, where radiation exposures are well-defined in
terms of dose, distribution and timing, and thus quite different from
radiation accidents, a predictive radiation biomarker of individual
radiation sensitivity should be (i) able to predict heterogeneity of
radiation responses among patients in clinic, (ii) specific to
radiation, (iii) sensitive, (iv) able to show signal persistence as
applicable to radiation therapy or have known time-course kinetics of
signal, (v) amenable for non-invasive or minimally-invasive sampling,
(vi) amenable to automation to improve quality control and assurance,
(vii) have a quick turn-around time between sampling and results (though
 speed is not as critical as in the countermeasures scenarios), (viii)
and be cost effective.\nThis contract topic aims to encourage the
development and validation of predictive radiation biomarkers for
clinical applications as described above. Both the FDA and the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) through Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendment (CLIA) regulate diagnostic tests. A reasonable
predictive radiation biomarker development process for identifying
likely \u201cover-responders\u201d to radiation treatment may involve
biomarker discovery, assay design and validation, determination of assay
 feasibility, assay optimization and harmonization, assessing the assay
performance characteristics (reproducibility, sensitivity, specificity
etc.), determining the effect of confounders, if any, determination of
suitable assay platforms and platform migration as may often be needed,
and clinical validation with a locked-down assay before regulatory
submission and commercialization. Early pre-IDE interaction with FDA is
therefore critical. The following activities and deliverables are
applicable to both biomarkers for acute early effects and surrogate
endpoints for late effects.\nPhase I Activities and Deliverables\nPhase I
 contract proposals must describe (i) a quantitative estimate of the
patient population that will benefit from the availability of such
predictive radiation biomarkers for the applicable cancer type\/organ
site, (ii) a plan for generating evidence that the proposed biomarker or
 biomarkers are relevant in the prediction of radiation
hyper-sensitivity among patients with cancer and logical approach in the
 developmental pathway to clinic from discovery, (iii) a description of
assay characteristics including sensitivity and specificity and the
effects of known confounders, if any, (iv) level of technological
maturity, describing critical technology elements allowing technology
readiness assessment by the reviewers, (v) and a description of the
proposed regulatory pathway for approval and pre-IDE consultation with
FDA. In such meetings with FDA it is expected that the applicant will
invite NCI\u2019s participation, where

        "topic_name": "Molecularly Targeted Radiation Therapy for Cancer
 Treatment",
        "description": "Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) enables
personalized cancer treatment by combining the therapeutic effect of
radiation therapy with the targeting capability of molecular
therapies.&amp;nbsp; In TRT, a cytotoxic dose of a radioactive isotope
is attached to monoclonal antibodies, receptor ligands, or synthetic
molecules that target malignant tumor cells selectively. The ability of
these molecules to bind specifically to a tumor-associated structure
ensures that the tumor gets a lethal dose of radiation, while normal
tissue gets only a minimal dose. This minimizes toxicity to normal
tissues and can increase therapeutic efficacy (therapeutic index)
leading to a reduction of overall treatment costs.\nCurrently available
TRT compounds such as Zevalin and Bexxar have been developed and
approved in the United States for use in the treatment of non Hodgkins
Lymphoma (NHL).&amp;nbsp; Although these drugs have shown a response
rate of approximately 80%, they have failed to show a survival advantage
 in patients. Large multicenter trials to study long- term survival are
currently underway.&amp;nbsp; Because these drugs have had modest
commercial success to date, private investment in molecularly-targeted
radiation pharmaceuticals remains at low levels.&amp;nbsp; As this class
 of treatments shows tremendous clinical potential, there is a need to
encourage the development of next-generation technologies (see below)
for cancers other than NHL, including solid tumors, where the clinical
need is most acute.\nProject Goals\nThis contract solicitation seeks to
stimulate research, development, and commercialization of innovative TRT
 techniques that could potentially shorten treatment cycles and reduce
toxicity to normal tissues. Proposals addressing the following
technology areas are encouraged: new treatment strategies; design,
synthesis and evaluation of innovative ligands and radiotracers for TRT;
 novel radioisotope generators and radioisotope production techniques;
dosimetry techniques; and new conjugation chemistries that can link the
radioisotopes to targeting agents other than antibodies (e.g. existing
small molecule chemotherapeutic drugs) are also encouraged.\nThe
short-term goal of the project is to perform feasibility studies for
development and use of possible radioimmunotherapeutics for the
treatment of cancer.&amp;nbsp; The long-term goal of the project is to
enable a small business to bring a fully developed TRT compound to the
clinic and eventually to the market.\nPhase I Activities and
Deliverables\nPhase I activities should support the technical
feasibility of the innovative approach. Specific activities and
deliverables during Phase I should
include:\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Proof-of-concept of the conjugation or attachment of the radioisotope
to the antibody or other targeting
moiety.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Radiation dosimetry studies in an appropriate small animal
model\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Proof-of-concept small animal studies demonstrating an improved
therapeutic efficacy and improved therapeutic index, assessment of
toxicity to normal tissues, and pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic studies
 utilizing an appropriate animal model.\nPhase II Activities and
Deliverables\nWhere cooperation of other vendors or collaborators is
critical for implementation of proposed technology, the offeror should
provide evidence of such cooperation (through written partnering
agreements, or letters of intent to enter into such agreements) as part
of the Phase II proposal.\nSpecific activities and deliverables during
Phase II should
include:\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Demonstration of the TRT manufacturing and scale-up
scheme\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

sensitivity of the technology when compared to other
technologies.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

        "topic_name": "Signal Amplification to Enable Attomolar
Quantitation in Slide-Based or ELISA Biomarker Immunoassays",
        "description": "Accurate detection of specific markers is
crucial for the diagnosis of malignant disease, monitoring drug therapy
and patient screening. The development of sensitive and reliable
strategies for the detection of biomarkers at ultra-low concentration is
 of particular importance to cancer medicine.&amp;nbsp; Efforts have
been made to develop techniques for the amplification of signals, but
there is still a paucity of novel approaches used specifically to
improve the simplicity, selectivity and sensitivity of cancer biomarker
assays, especially for the interrogation of tumor tissue.\nThe current
work focus of this SBIR topic is for incorporation of an existing or
novel signal amplification system&amp;nbsp; into&amp;nbsp; high value
cancer biomarker antibody based&amp;nbsp; assays&amp;nbsp; (ELISA type
or slide-based&amp;nbsp; IFA\/IHC) to enable an increase in accuracy and
 sensitivity (at least 100-fold) for&amp;nbsp; detection of the specific
 analyte at the lowest possible&amp;nbsp; concentration level. Detection
 at attomolar\/sub-femtomolar concentrations is desired. These assays
must be optimized for performance on tumor tissues and tissue extracts,
which requires a fundamentally different approach than those commonly
used for high-sensitivity serum assays already in use in the field.\nIn
vitro immunoassays are probably the most common, simple and relatively
inexpensive methods used in clinical laboratories for the diagnosis and
management of disease. Despite continued efforts to improve the
performance of immunoassays, there is an urgent need for assays with
increased sensitivity (i.e., attomolar sensitivity) and accuracy for
detection of low-level disease markers specifically in tumor
tissue.\nThere are many amplification systems that have been published
in the past 10-15 year but most have limited effect,&amp;nbsp;
demonstrating improved sensitivity &amp;lt; 10 fold,&amp;nbsp; and have
not been widely adopted in the clinical lab.&amp;nbsp; One issue is low
signal-to-noise ratio; noise often increases with signal
amplification.&amp;nbsp; There is a big technological gap as we learn
more and more about signaling molecules in cancer; many are tightly
regulated with low levels of protein expression. Simply put, the
existing assays are not of sufficient sensitivity to detect low
abundance biomarkers.&amp;nbsp; Finally, the most commonly requested
utility for these existing assays is on serum or cell line lysates, not
solid tumor tissues. There is a great need for the development of highly
 sensitive\/specific antibody based assays that can detect analytes in
tumor lysates (ELISA) and in tumor tissue sections (IFA\/IHC).\nThe
current techniques used in molecular tag detection assays use
radiolabels, electrical, light scattering, fluorescent, and
chemiluminescent molecules\u2014see table below. Most of the
commercially available labels have inherent limitations in signal
strength. These assay limitations lead to numerous drawbacks in our
ability to measure low abundant biomarkers to improve the clinical care
of the patient \u2013 to include:\n\nThe assay is limited (i.e., the
sensitivity of an assay is not sufficient to detect biomarkers in
majority of clinical specimens) to the measurements of biomolecules in
clinical situations where they are present in high abundance (e.g.,
protein overexpression or high gene copy number)\nThe assays can only be
 applied to biological samples where biomolecules are more abundant such
 as tumor tissue, but not to more easily obtained non-invasive
specimens, such as blood, where the biomolecules are often present but
in extremely low- abundance.\nThe current lower sensitivity of antibody
based assays limits detection of many signaling molecules, and where
they can be detected, often it will not be possible to detect a
drug-mediated decrease in the signal (e.g., for pharmacodynamics [PD]
applications).\nIf the biomarker is of low abundance, then the reliable
measurement via an ELISA assay requires the consumption of large amounts
 of biological samples (e.g., tumor needle biopsies)&amp;nbsp; to bring
up the protein level&amp;nbsp; high enough to quantitate biomarkers at
the&amp;nbsp; limits of detection (i.e., in the process,&amp;nbsp; large
 amount of precious tumor biopsy is lost to further molecular analyses)

Mirkin.&amp;nbsp; Nature 462, 461-464, 2009 \nRecently, a few new
technologies have been described in the literature that is reported to
achieve 102-106 fold improvement in signal strength.&amp;nbsp; Many of
the technologies bring together large aggregates of immune complexes to
produce amplified detection signals several magnitudes greater than
reagents in which unitary labels are coupled directly to the secondary
antigen or antibody without using multi-label
scaffolds.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A short description of some of the more
promising technologies is listed below with greater details found in
Appendix A. These technologies described below are representative, but
not exclusive; offerors are welcome to propose solution technologies not
 listed below, provided they address the aims of this
solicitation.\nPlasmonic absorbers, especially in the infrared (IR)
range, have potential applications for biochemical sensing, imaging,
energy conversion, and other medical diagnostics. One technology
referred to as \u201cNanobar shaped disk-coupled dots-onpillar
antenna-array\u201d (Bar-D2PA) claims up to 1 million fold improvement
of immune sensitivity. \u2013 see DocLINK. The D2PA is composed of an
array of dense three-dimensional nanoantennas that can be layered with
immunological reagents to create a specific assay. The benefits of the
bar-D2PA technology are:\n(a) low manufacturing costs;\n(b) multiple
identifying resonance peaks;\n(c) tunable transmission with high
absorption;&amp;nbsp; and\n(d) high-field regional cross-section for
analyte detection.&amp;nbsp; The bar-D2PA structure shows unique mid-IR
light response with polarization-dependent plasmonic
resonances.\n&amp;nbsp;\nNanoparticle-based bio-bar codes for the
ultrasensitive detection of proteins have attomolar sensitivity. This
ultrasensitive method for detecting protein analytes is referred to as
the bio-barcode method and has been shown to amplify the signal from
extremely low levels of protein or oligonucleotide in solution as
published by Mirkin and colleagues (Nam et al., 2003). The principle is
to get low-abundant proteins to bind to particles containing a target
specific antibody \u2013 this particle is also tagged with thousands of
identical single strands of DNA to the target analyte gene which is used
 to amplify the signal. A magnetic particle tagged with another analyte
specific antibody (different epitope) pulls the analyte-particle complex
 out of solution, and the DNA is separated from the captured particle
and quantified.\nAnother approach of amplification technology is
3DNA\u00ae developed by Genisphere which is a 3-dimensional structure
made entirely out of DNA. For many applications, a four-layer
arrangement is used, which has an average of 280 +\/- 20 arms per
molecule. The arms are modified with labels and targeting
moieties.&amp;nbsp; As examples, the labels can be fluorescent,
enzymatic (HRP, AP), nanogold, or a hapten (biotin, FITC, DIG); and the
targeting moiety may be an antibody, peptide, specified RNA\/DNA
sequence, aptamer, PNA, or a hapten (biotin, FITC, DIG). Mixing and
matching a variety of labels and targets on the same 3DNA core creates a
 highly customized reagent. Genisphere\u2019s 3DNA technology has been
used to improve the limit of detection by up to 100-fold in a variety of
 assay platforms, including microarray, ELISA, bead-based flow
cytometry, and lateral flow.\nAnother novel signal amplification
strategy in lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) utilizes three amplification
 steps: (a) biotin-streptavidin amplification; (b) polylysine
amplification; and (c) fluorescence dye signal amplification.&amp;nbsp;
The resulting conjugates achieved a detection limit 100-fold lower than
that of the magnetic beads-based ELISA and gold-based LFIA.\nThe
Enzyme-cascade-amplification strategy (ECAS-CIA) allows detection of
low-abundance proteins by coupling with enzyme cascade amplification
strategy (DocLINK).&amp;nbsp; In the presence of target analyte, the
labeled alkaline phosphatase on secondary antibody catalyzes the
formation of palladium nanostructures, which catalyze
3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine-H2O2 system to produce the
colored products, thus resulting in the signal cascade
amplification.\nIt is believe that these technologies and other new
technologies could have broad applicability to improving the sensitivity
 of ELISA and slide-based immunoassays for target proteins as well as
for nucleic acid detection assay platforms. However, most of these
reagents and associated instrumentations are not commercially available
to laboratory researcher or adapted to clinical quality
assays.\nReferences:\nDavid A. Giljohann &amp;amp; Chad A. MirkinNature

advances in biomedical research and the growing biotechnology industry,
development of highly sensitive and economical assays will meet an unmet
 need and serve to promote the use of biomarkers in the personalized
care of patients.&amp;nbsp; These enhanced detection technologies can
also be directed towards designing fully automated, highly sensitive
assays to identify multiple disease markers in a single clinical
specimen using multiple assay platforms and to improve the amount of
molecular information that a clinician obtains for more precise care of
the cancer patients.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe increasing demand for screening
assays at the early stage of disease development and from
minimally-sized specimens calls for ultrasensitive detection of
biologically relevant biomarkers at an extremely low level of
expression. To keep pace with expectations in clinical assays, there is
still the quest for more flexible, yet highly sensitive, quantitative,
and easy-to-use methods.&amp;nbsp; This SBIR topic is to support assay
development that pushes the level of analyte detection to the absolute
maximum.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe goal of this SBIR topic is to incorporate
recent advances in signal amplification methods into the development of
quantitative ELISA and\/or slide-based antibody assays (IFA\/IHC) to low
 abundance but high value cancer biomarkers. The amplification system
could be chemical, bio-chemical, nano-particle, or any other component
based.&amp;nbsp; The desired aim is to improve the sensitivity of an
assay by at least 100-fold and preferably thousand-fold.&amp;nbsp;
Demonstrating the diagnostic potential of existing or novel
amplification systems (i.e., platform, tagging, enrichment)&amp;nbsp; in
 antibody based assays to protein analytes will provide the foundation
for their use in other molecular assays (FISH, RNA in situ, etc) \u2013
i.e. this SBIR will support a significant technological advance in
molecular test development in general by promoting the integration of
emerging technology into the diagnostic paradigm.\nThere are two
objectives:\nObjective 1. Select an appropriate signal enhancing system
to improve the signal strength \/sensitivity of an ELISA or slide-based
antibody assays (IFA\/IHC)&amp;nbsp; using tumor tissue by 102-106 fold
(preferably at attomolar levels) for two high value cancer biomarkers,

 NCI may provide reagents to selected PD biomarkers and\/or the

maintain the integrity of ELISA and\/or slide-based antibody assay
designs and be easily adaptable to widely used formats\/platforms in
clinical laboratories (i.e.,&amp;nbsp; 96 well microtiter plate assay,
detection instrumentation, bead based detection, automated slide
strainers, flurosecent microscopes, etc.).\nPhase I Activities and
Deliverables\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The amplification technology must provide a significant improvement in
assay sensitivity (102-106 fold) to high value low abundant cancer
biomarkers using tumor tissue. Two assays are to be developed with the
new amplification
system.&amp;nbsp;\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The amplification technology must be consistently manufacturable, and
if new instrumentation is required, size and cost of prototype
instrumentation should be within reach of a clinical
lab.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Any alteration in the assay design or assay protocol as an attempt to
increase the sensitivity of the assay constitutes a critical issue and
introduces bias resulting from the changes made. The assay design must
be adjusted to optimize the analytic performance of the assay for
clinical utility while ensuring analytic validity using proper controls
to minimize false results. Suggested activities to test for optimal
assay performance are:\no&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Optimize the assay to
increase signal over background noise and maintain the optimal kinetics
of the assay (in fact faster assays with improved kinetics should be
possible with a strong amplification system). Appropriate controls and
calibrators are to be used.\no&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Evaluate the
specificity of the higher sensitivity assay to make sure that it is
unchanged by challenging the system with interfering substance es and
related proteins.\no&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The reproducibility and
precision of the enhanced antibody based assay are to be evaluated by
calculating the intra- and inter-batch variation coefficients (CVs of
the assays using the same batch of signal enhancing reagent should be
&amp;lt;20%).\no&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The batch-to-batch reproducibility
using at least 2 different batches of the signal enhancing reagent,
performed on different days with different operators should have CV
&amp;lt;20%.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Assay performance must be tested in the appropriate non-clinical models
 for the chosen immunoassay analytes.&amp;nbsp; NCI will recommend at
least two models and expects that at least 6 separate specimen
preparations from the models will be tested for statistical
determinations.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The assay, associated methodology, and if applicable, instrumentation
will be independently verified by an external laboratory (NCI may be
available for this activity).&amp;nbsp;\nPhase II Activities and
Deliverables\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Expand and \u2018optimize\u2019 enhanced detection for the selected
ELISA or slide-based antibody assays (at least 100 fold to bring
analysis in attomolar range) to at least 4 high value oncology
biomarkers, preferably from NCI\u2019s list of desired
analytes.&amp;nbsp; Test in appropriate models using target specific
calibrators and controls. The assays\/associated equipment must be
affordable and easily adaptable to standard clinical
laboratories.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Reproducibly manufacture signal amplification reagents for the 4 high
value oncology biomarkers (3 lots) and do at least 6 months stability

        "topic_name": "Identification and Capture of Enriched Tumor
Zones with Preservation of Labile Biomarkers from Ultra-Cold Biopses",
        "description": "Personalized medicine approaches allow the
treatment of patient tumors with drugs tailored to their tumors, which
increase the probability of a beneficial response.&amp;nbsp; In the last
 decade, a number of pharmacodynamic (PD) markers have been identified
that help the physician know that the drug is hitting the target or
target pathway in the patient\u2019s tumor.&amp;nbsp; Recently approved
cancer treatments target either the cell surface receptors at the head
of these signaling pathways or the intermediate phosphoproteins and
kinases in the pathway signaling cascades. Understanding the
phosphoprotein activation state of key signaling molecules in tumor
cells can yield critical information on the type, stage and status of
those cells, aiding in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of an
individual\u2019s disease.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, target analyte
lability, especially with phosphoproteins, requires adoption of rapid
and highly controlled tissue collection and handling before widespread
clinical use of the assays in predicting drug response.&amp;nbsp; Also,
in some cases, the magnitude of drug modulation of biomarker may be
small but still significant in correlating to overall tumor response,
which mandates the use of quantitative assays in enriched samples of
tumor.&amp;nbsp; NCI\/DCTD has developed analytic multiplexed ELISA type
 immunoassays to cancer drug targets\/pathways that quantitate actual
analyte levels in tumor lysates.\nHowever, there is an inherent problem
in the use of tissue lysates in that a tissue is comprised not only of
tumor cells but also of normal parenchyma, stromal cells, inflammatory
cells, vessels, and often significant necrosis, so when a specimen
sample is homogenized the macromolecules extracted is a sum of&amp;nbsp;
 all cellular\/matrix components, proportional to each representative
element. Thus, the presence of non-target cells and necrosis can
significantly affect the quantification of protein levels in
\u2018viable\u2019 tumor cells.&amp;nbsp; Even the most sophisticated
testing methods are of limited value when the input DNA, RNA, or protein
 is contaminated or diluted by non-target cells and necrotic\/acellular
matrix. The requirement for relatively pure cell populations has led to
various technical solutions, most notable Laser Capture Microdissection
(LCM). Microdissection techniques permit analysis of various molecular
signatures within a specific cell population of a tissue and reduce the
interference from non-target cell populations and acellular matrix such
as fibrosis\/necrosis. Although there are numerous reports of genetic
and gene expression analyses of microdissected tumor populations, and of
 proteomic assessment using Western blot, 2D-PAGE, mass spectrometry,
and peptide sequencing, studies using ELISA\/immunoassay quantitation of
 key drug targets are limited. Tumor enrichment techniques that allow
the rapid capture of tumor rich zones from core needle biopsies (not
sections) have the potential to provide sufficient tumor amounts for
analyte quantitation in tumor cells residing within a tissue with the
sensitivity and specificity of ELISA. This technology will have
significant clinical value.&amp;nbsp;\nThe purpose\/goal of this SBIR
topic is the development and commercialization of a
visualization\/microdissection system that is capable of identifying and
 capture of \u2018viable\u2019 tumor rich zones in frozen solid tumor
biopsies under conditions that preserve labile pharmacodynamics (PD)
biomarkers for antibody mediated
quantitation.&amp;nbsp;\nMicrodissection technologies are powerful tools
 for the isolating enriched populations of tumor cells from cellular
heterogeneous tissues. It has been shown that the harvested cells can be
 used for many molecular investigations including DNA, RNA, protein,
microRNA, and protein analyses (See Figure 1 below). The goal of this
SBIR topic is to adapt \/ improve existing visualization strategies for
frozen solid tumor needle biopsies allowing microdissection of large
tumor rich zones with 50% tumor region enrichment while preserving
labile biomarkers. The desire is to include quantitative
ELISA\/immunoassay in the list of molecular analyses (see chart below)
that can be performed reliably on microdissected cell populations by
developing a system for the rapid identification and dissection of
enriched tumor cell zones from frozen biopsies. These tumor rich zones
should provide sufficient material for multiplex ELISA quantitation of
biomarkers. This system will be much more time-effective and productive
than the labor intensive microdissection of multiple tissue sections
from a biopsy. The ability to quantify biomarkers via immunoassay of
isolated biopsy zones enriched for \u2018viable\u2019 tumor cells is
especially important when a biomarker is only modulated to a small
extent requiring very sensitive and specific analytic assays. Of note,
the development of this technology has the potential to improve the
\u2018specificity\u2019 of any molecular test that involves
homogenization of the tissue and macromolecular
isolation.\n&amp;nbsp;\nApplied Immunohistochemistry &amp;amp; Molecular

Barry L. Karger\u2021**\nProject Goals\nELISA\/Immunoassays have the
capacity to quantify the levels of a specific analytes in a
specimen.&amp;nbsp; There are two important considerations in the
reliability of immunoassays to accurately measure the levels of PD
biomarkers and the use of the information in clinical
care:\n1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Many of the
drug biomarkers are very labile and require immediate processing after
collection which usually involves rapid freezing or lysis in buffers
with specific inhibitors (e.g., phosphatase
inhibitors).\n2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Tumors are not of a homogeneous cell type and often contain significant
amounts of necrotic and normal cell zones which will impinge on the
accurate measurement of an analyte in the tumor population if the entire
 tissue sample is homogenized.&amp;nbsp;\nIt is believed that the
development of microdissection techniques for identification and
collection of viable tumor zones with at least 50% tumor enrichment from
 frozen solid tumor biopsies under conditions that preserve the
stability of labile biomarkers can lead to detailed quantitative
assessment of key protein targets modulated by drugs in tumor cells in
their natural microenvironment and increase the PD utility of selected
biomarkers.\nThe use of an appropriate visualization technologies and
microdissection method such laser capture microdissection (LCM) is
proposed.&amp;nbsp; The LCM process has the advantage of working with
tissue in various physical states, particular frozen (a state that would
 preserve labile phosphoprotein biomarkers), and does not alter the
morphology or biochemistry of the sample collected. LCM has demonstrated
 success in collecting selected cells for molecular analyses, particular
 when frozen sections are used. Limitations of LCM include difficulties
of microdissection due to decreased optical resolution of tissue
sections.&amp;nbsp; Possible options to improve cell resolution include
the use of specialized optics to identify tumor zones via
architectural\/morphometric\/light refraction\/density parameters or the
 use of special stains or immunohistochemistry\/immunofluorescence. This
 topic goal is to develop \u2018identification\u2019 or visualization
and capture methods for frozen solid tumor needle biopsies or thick
sections.&amp;nbsp; These techniques must not impinge on the stability
of the labile biomarkers (i.e., frozen conditions must be
maintained).&amp;nbsp;\nThe goalof this SBIR topic is to develop a
reliable visualization approach to identify and capture zones of
\u2018viable\u2019 tumor cells from frozen solid tumor biopsies that
lead to at least 50% enrichment of tumor zones. &amp;nbsp;The technology
 should focus on distinguishing tumor regions from non-tumor zones and
acellular matrix, such as necrosis, upon scanning frozen solid tumor
biopsies or thick sections. This technology will result in the
collection of relatively large areas of biopsy material that is enriched
 in tumor cells with preserved labile biomarkers and of sufficient
amounts to be amenable to quantitation by
ELISA\/Immunoassay.&amp;nbsp;\nThe first objective should be to develop
reliable methods to distinguish enriched \u2018viable\u2019 tumor zones
from necrotic zones or viable tumor zones from normal cell types in
frozen solid tumor biopsies or thick sections. Malignant transformation
is associated with structural, genotypic\/phenotypic cellular
modifications, and biochemical changes, which as a consequence, alter
the spectroscopic, metabolic and microscopic properties. These and other
 alterations may be exploited to develop a means to scan frozen solid
tumor biopsies \/thick sections and identify zones that correlate to
cellular\/acellular areas in the biopsy. The optimal scanning system
should be able to extract information about the morphological\/
architecture\/ spectroscopic properties in the frozen biopsy that may be
 used to distinguish normal and malignant areas; such as, the
measurement of color, overall density or light reflectance which may
correlate to cellular density and\/or vascularity which in turn may
reflect tumor zones.\nThe second objective is to microdissect and
capture the enriched tumor zones from frozen solid tumor biopsies\/thick
 sections in a manner that preserves the label PD biomarkers, while
maintaining the tumor zone as frozen throughout the process. Such a
product will enable the reliable identification and capture of
relatively large amounts of pure populations of tumor cells from frozen
solid tumor biopsies which are amenable for quantification of label
biomarkers via immunoassays, thus increasing the sensitivity and
specificity of the assays for the target in tumor cells and their PD
utility.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \nPhase I Activities and
Deliverables\nThe essential characteristics of a tumor enrichment
microdissection system of frozen solid tumor biopsies should include all
 or some of the following
features:\n&amp;nbsp;\n1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; a
biopsy\/thick section scanning\/microdissection method that is adaptable
 for use with most common microscopic\/microdissection systems with the
capability to maintain the specimens under freezing temperatures;
\n2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; able to generate an easily
interpretable signal indicative of parameters that can distinguish
between necrotic and viable tumor, and if possible, also between tumor
and non-tumor tissue; \n3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; be
capable of microdissection of enriched tumor zones without inducing
significant cellular damage or change in labile PD biomarkers (i.e.
maintain frozen state); and \n4)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 able to perform as designed and intended in fit-for-purpose studies in
relevant clinical veterinary models (i.e. the method&amp;nbsp; has to
produce tumor tissue of sufficient quantity and quality for ELISA
based&amp;nbsp; immunoassay).\nTo accomplish the goal of this SBIR topic
 to develop microdissection techniques that reliably identifies and
captures tumor-rich \u2018viable\u2019 zones in frozen, unfixed tumor
biopsy cores or thick sections in a manner that preserves labile drug
target\/pathway PD biomarkers for quantitative ELISA\/Immunoassay
analyses, the Phase I deliverables
are:\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Develop a microscopic visualization\/microdissection method to identify
 and capture \u2018viable\/cellular\u2019 tumor zones from frozen tumor
biopsies\/thick sections from at least two solid tumor types while
maintaining the frozen state of the specimen.&amp;nbsp; The use of the
entire needle tumor biopsy is preferred. Any gauge needle biopsy can be
used for Phase I development, but 18 gauge is desired for Phase II. The
readout from the visualization\/scan of the frozen biopsy should be
easily interpretable (e.g. cellular rich or acellular rich) and is
associated with the level of necrosis and \u2018viable\u2019 cell-rich
tumor zones, and if possible, between tumor and non-tumor
\u2018normal\u2019 zones.&amp;nbsp; Xenograft tumors may be used for
developing this technology.&amp;nbsp; NCI can recommend specific
xenografts that have sufficient levels of specific labile PD biomarkers
and are known for developing necrosis. (See Table 1
below).\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The purity and cellularity of the captured zones can be assessed by
H&amp;amp;E staining and imaging.&amp;nbsp; Initially the histology of
the entire biopsy will need to be analyzed to associate the
visualization measurement with the histology (i.e. the cellular quantity
 and cellular types present throughout the biopsy).&amp;nbsp; One option
 is that during the development phase, the biopsy can be cut
longitudinally into 2 halves with one side being subjected to frozen
sectioning and H&amp;amp;E staining for histological evaluation and the
2nd half to being scanned via the visualization method. This will allow
the visualization measures to be related to the histology of the biopsy.
 As to the quantitative needs, it will depend on the assay; for example,
 for the DCTD apoptosis multiplex immunoassay, 20 ug of protein is
required per panel, preferably with 50% tumor cell
content.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Demonstrate that the visualization\/capture technology preserves in the
 enriched tumor cells at least one of labile protein biomarkers of
interest to NCI (see Table 1 below).&amp;nbsp; Maintaining the biopsy
specimen under freezing conditions is mandatory and it is preferred that
 the enriched tumor zones be kept frozen. If specimen loss after capture
 is an issue, then the use of special lysis buffer may be approved by
NCI. NCI may provide assistance in the analysis of the biomarker levels
in isolated tumor
zones.&amp;nbsp;\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The device and methodology need to be independently tested&amp;nbsp; at
 a different laboratory.&amp;nbsp; NCI may be willing to perform the
independent validation\/field testing of the breadboard prototype device
 and associated methodology.\nTable 1: Suggested Phospho-protein PD

recommended to be 18 gauge for Phase II activities.&amp;nbsp; The
activities\/deliverables
are:\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Processes\/instrumentation should be optimized to reproducibly identify
 and allow microdissection of \u2018viable\u2019 cell rich tumor zones
from frozen tumor biopsies\/thick sections of at least 4 different tumor
 types, evaluating a minimum of 6 specimens from each type (e.g.,
xenograft models).&amp;nbsp; Reproducibility should be demonstrated by 2
 users on 3 different days. Images of H&amp;amp;E stained slides of the
isolated tumor zones should be provided to demonstrate reliability of
the
technique.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Demonstrate preservation of 2 labile PD biomarkers via
ELISA\/immunoassay. NCI may provide assistance in this
task.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

independent validation\/field testing at a separate laboratory. NCI may
be willing to do
this.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

        "topic_name": "Proximity Slide-Based Sandwich Immunoassay to
Visualize Intramolecular Epitopes of Analytes in Tissue Sections",
        "description": "The cancer community has developed a series of
single-plex and multiplex immunofluorescent assays (IFA) to evaluate
oncology biomarkers in tumor sections on slides.&amp;nbsp; Many of the
assay targets are key DNA damage response and signaling molecules
(\u03b3H2AX, Nbs1, ERCC1, RAD51, RAD50, pATR, pchk2, cdk\/PY15, pKAP,
MET \u2013 total-pY1234\/pY1235-pY1236, AKT- pT308pS473,
ERK1-pY202pT204, and ERK2-pY185pT187).&amp;nbsp; Our understanding of
DNA damage response and signaling in tumors is critically dependent on
our ability to visualize and quantify specific signaling molecules with
high spatial resolution in the cellular context.&amp;nbsp; However,
these slide-based assays are at most semi-quantitative.
ELISA\/Immunoassays have the capacity to precisely quantify the levels
of a specific analytes in a specimen. ELISA analysis of whole tissue
homogenates would be more informative if the analysis could be done on a
 pure population of tumor cells; however, tumors are not of a
homogeneous cell type and often contain significant amounts of necrotic
and normal cell zones which will impinge on the accurate measurement of
an analyte in the tumor population if the entire tissue sample is
homogenized. So, there is an un-met need to improve the specificity and
sensitivity of slide-based immunoassays that visualize analytes on
single cell types to approach or exceed that of quantitative ELISAs. It
is clear that the current proximity technology has the potential to
provide a robust foundation for significant improvements in the design
and construction of cell type specific quantitative slide-based, cancer
biomarker, IFA for the interrogation of tumor sections.&amp;nbsp;\nThe
applications of proximity technology such as Fluorescence Resonance
Energy Transfer (FRET) or Radio Frequency have expanded tremendously in
the last 25 years. Proximity technology has enabled the quantitative
analysis of molecular dynamics in biophysics and in molecular biology,
such as monitoring of protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA
interactions, and protein conformational changes.
\n&amp;nbsp;\nProximity technology shows great promise for further
development in the utility and scope of biological applications due to
dramatic improvements in instrumentation, particularly with respect to
time-resolved techniques. Advances in signaling tag such as fluorescent
probe development have produced smaller and more stable molecules with
new mechanisms of attachment to biological targets. For example,
fluorophores have also been developed with a wide range of intrinsic
excited state lifetimes, and a significant effort is being placed on
development of a greater diversity in genetic variations of fluorescent
proteins. Entirely new classes of tag materials, many of which are
smaller than previous fluorophores, allow for the evaluation of
molecular interactions at lower separation distances, promise to improve
 the versatility of labeling and lead to new applications of the
proximity techniques.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThis topic is focused on developing
slide-based proximity technologies using two specific antibodies at
different epitopes of the target to enable more accurate quantitation of
 cancer biomarkers in tumor cells in tissue
sections.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Initial focus should be on epitopes within
 the same target molecule. This new technological approach has the
potential to improve slide-based IFA sensitivity and specificity to
approach or exceed that of sandwich ELISA testing of tissue homogenates
and have the advantage of visualization of the cell types that express
the biomarker and enable the quantitation of the state biomarker (e.g.,
activation) in specific cell types.\n&amp;nbsp;\nIt is believed that the
 development of the proximity reagents for dual antibody staining of
tissue sections to high value cancer biomarkers will have great research
 value and have a significant clinical impact; i.e., direct
visualization and quantitation of informative biomarkers in the tumor
population that the drug
targets.\n&amp;nbsp;\nReferences:\n1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Goals\nOver the past decade, biosensors based on fluorescent proteins,
FRET, and recently radio-frequency tags have emerged as major classes of
 probes that are capable of tracking a variety of cellular signaling
events, such as second messenger dynamics and enzyme
activation\/activity, in time and space. For example, a donor
chromo\/fluorophore, initially in its electronic excited state, may
transfer energy to an acceptor chromo\/flurophore through nonradiative
dipole\u2013dipole coupling.&amp;nbsp; The efficiency of this energy
transfer is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance
between donor and acceptor, making FRET extremely sensitive to small
changes in distance.&amp;nbsp; Depending on the types of detection
probes used, the distance \/proximity between donor and acceptor can be
between 1 nm and 10 nm to generate a signal.\nThere is increased use of
proximity biosensors, particularly tagged-antibodies in combination with
 signaling factors (electric, optical, etc.) to provide a specific
signal directly related to the concentration of an analyte. These
proximity reagents have the potential to allow rapid detection of the
target with the sensitivity and specificity of a sandwich assay.\nThe
goal of this topic is to develop reagents\/methods for use of dual
primary antibodies to different epitopes of the same analyte or to
different subunits of a target that, upon binding of the molecule(s) in
cells within a tissue section, will generate a proximity signal due to
close spatial association of the antibody reagents containing
donor\/acceptor tags, respectively (e.g., flurochromes).&amp;nbsp; This
signal can be captured and visualized to cell types as well as
quantitated via conventional microscopy.&amp;nbsp;\nThe benefit is that
antibody based proximity assays to high value cancer biomarkers will
represent a significant advancement in detection capabilities for
slide-based immunoassays of tumor sections.&amp;nbsp; These assays will
provide specific, sensitive and reliable detection of targets in a cell
specific manner and approach or exceed ELISA level quantitation which
has significant clinical applications.\nPhase I Activities and
Deliverables\nThe goal is to replicate or exceed the sensitivity and
specificity of an ELISA in slide-based immunoassays of tumor specimens.
The objective is to develop and test the applicability of double
antibody labeling using proximity technology for the detection of two
epitopes on TWO high value oncology biomarkers, preferably choosing NCI
designated biomarkers.&amp;nbsp; This may involve the development of new
 proximity tags adapted for use in dual antibody labeling of
histological sections.&amp;nbsp; The readout will be the successful
localization of protein based analytes in the appropriate cell type when
 expressed at varying levels (i.e., specificity\/sensitivity) and
quantitation of the cell specific signal that agrees with known protein
levels measured by other biochemical methods \u2013 initially using
non-clinical models to evaluate.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\nBiomarkers
important to NCI are oncology-relevant proteins that have two epitopes
of interest; for example, one could select epitope specific antibodies
to allow for cell specific visualization and quantitation of the amount
of a receptor in a cell that is also phosphorylated at a specific
epitope.\nThe NCI biomarkers and possible epitopes of interest for

        "topic_name": "Highly Innovative Tools for Quantifying Redox
Effector Dynamics in Cancer",
        "description": "The generation and dynamic interplay of redox
effector molecules (e.g., oxygen, free radicals, peroxides, nitrogen
oxides, and hydrogen sulfide) are fundamental features underlying the
genomic, structural, metabolic and functional alterations observed in
cancers.&amp;nbsp; Alterations in redox balance impact all phases of
disease including carcinogenesis, disease progression, response to
treatment and prevention.&amp;nbsp; For example, the DNA damaging
effects of free radicals can mutagenize key oncogenic sites.&amp;nbsp;
Redox imbalances occur by abnormalities commonly associated with cancers
 including mutations in p53, myc and ras pathways.&amp;nbsp; Redox
effectors operate to modify protein function at the post-translational
level, which plays a significant mechanistic role in the phenotypic
plasticity cancer cells demonstrate in the face of oxidative and
reductive (hypoxia) stresses.&amp;nbsp; Redox tone is a key regulator of
 the self-renewal properties of stem-like cancer cells, which has been
shown to contribute to tumor resistance to current
therapies.\n&amp;nbsp;\nProgress in the cancer biology and pre-clinical
space has been limited by the lack of tools that can accurately measure
redox parameters in animal models with sufficient spatio-temporal
resolution and minimal perturbation of the system.&amp;nbsp; NCI seeks
input from the small business community to develop and optimize a new
generation of quantitative and specific technologies that will enable
and accelerate basic research aimed at understanding basic redox
effector mechanisms and the roles they play in the cellular adaptations
and complex biology of tumors.\n&amp;nbsp;\nSupporting the development
of these technologies will allow researchers to validate and benchmark
data obtained across different 3D cell culture platforms and
pre-clinical animal model systems with the goal of accurately mimicking
tumor environments experienced by patients with cancer.&amp;nbsp;
Moreover, an enhanced ability to screen, manipulate, or analyze redox
dynamics is an invaluable index in the evaluation of cancer cell-tumor
responses to therapeutic interventions in the critical pre-clinical
testing phase.&amp;nbsp; These redox data have potential to
significantly improve our understanding of tumor biology and ability to
better predict treatment responses and long-term efficacy when
translated into patients.\nProject Goals\nThere is an unmet need in
basic cancer research for probes or technologies that can better
measure, characterize, profile, or resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics
of redox effectors at the subcellular to cellular levels.&amp;nbsp;
Genomic profiles, for instance, cannot capture post-translational redox
regulation that occurs with changes in the tumor
microenvironment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Redox probes have been
traditionally reliant on organic dyes that experience spectral shifts
with redox.&amp;nbsp; The current state of the art is genetically
encoded redox indicators that couple redox responsive enzyme motifs with
 indicator proteins.&amp;nbsp; These genetically engineered redox probes
 have improved response kinetics, but may have limited optical
qualities.&amp;nbsp; Given the critical role played by redox effectors,
developing a range of new tools will help us better understand how redox
 effectors regulate cell phenotypes in functional tumor
populations.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe goal of this FOA is to develop
quantitative tools to measure redox dynamics in biological
systems.&amp;nbsp; Ideally, probes or biosensor tools should be
minimally invasive as to not significantly perturb the system.&amp;nbsp;
 The technical approach should: (1) allow for in vivo measurements of
redox effector spatiotemporal dynamics; and\/or (2) be useable in high
throughput systems, for example to allow the screening of cellular
response to experimental perturbations, such as exposure to cytotoxic
agents.&amp;nbsp; The long term goal is that the technologies developed
through this contract can help validate whether data gathered in model
experimental systems faithfully represents the redox dynamics of human
tumors.\n&amp;nbsp;\nTo successfully meet this goal, offerors shall
develop a technology for the minimally to non-invasive measurement of
one or more redox effectors, including but not limited to oxygen, free
radicals, reactive oxygen species, peroxides, nitrogen oxides, and
hydrogen sulfide.&amp;nbsp; Phase I studies should focus on developing
the technology and demonstrating proof of concept in an in vitro system.
 Phase II studies further refine the technology and demonstrate the use
of the technology to measure redox effectors.&amp;nbsp; Offerors shall
justify their choice of approach with respect to the scientific utility
and commercial potential, and specify quantitative milestones that can
be used to evaluate the success of the technology being
developed.\n&amp;nbsp;\nIt is anticipated that offerors shall develop a
probe or similar agent that facilitates the measurement of redox
effectors by one or more imaging modalities; however, offerors are not
restricted to any particular technical approach and label or probe free
approaches that can meet the requirements of this contract are
welcome.\n&amp;nbsp;\nOfferors are not restricted to any particular
technical approach and can propose resource and tool development that
incorporates high-risk\/high-impact technologies.&amp;nbsp; Examples can
 include, but are not limited
to:\n&amp;nbsp;\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Redox probes that provide significant advances in sensitivity,
selectivity, ratiometric capability, or resolution in reporting the
spatial concentration gradients and temporal dynamics of redox effectors
 at the subcellular, cellular and\/or tissue compartment
levels.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Genetically encoded redox biosensors that are expressed in a cell or
tissue selective manner in small animal models of cancer for
interrogation by non-invasive to minimally invasive imaging
modalities.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Biology-inspired redox sensors (e.g., based on bacterial chemosensors)
that through synthetic biology techniques are genetically encoded for
expression in a cell or tissue selective
manner.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

functional parallel profile analyses of a combination of redox effectors
 (i.e., oxygen, nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, superoxide) and\/or
related species (e.g., proton, glutathione, ascorbate) across both time
and space at the subcellular, cellular and\/or tissue compartment
levels.\n&amp;nbsp;\nTechnologies that have the potential for in vivo
use, especially those with potential clinical applications in the long
term will be of particular interest, but methods that will be restricted
 to pre-clinical research applications are also of
interest.\n&amp;nbsp;\nPhase I Activities and

        "topic_name": "Modulating the Microbiome to Improve Efficacy of
Cancer Therapeutics",
        "description": "Metagenomic studies in humans and animal models
have established that there are alterations of the GI microbiota
community during development of neoplastic and pre-neoplastic disease,
and in tumor-bearing vs. healthy individuals. Understanding the impact
of human host\/microbiota interactions on the initiation, progression
and treatment of cancer, and the molecular mechanisms that govern the
outcomes of these interactions, will provide new therapeutic strategies
and new targets for the treatment of many human tumors.\nOne promising
approach emerging from recent research is alteration of microbiome
function designed to enhance the efficacy of cancer therapies.&amp;nbsp;
 Recent work demonstrated that individual variability in patient drug
response to chemo (and other) therapies can be attributed to actions of
the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota, either through direct metabolic
activity on the agent itself, or by effects on host barrier function and
 immunomodulation that affect drug bioavailability. For example,
microbial \u03b2-glucuronidase activity results in re-activation of
toxic metabolites that affect the dose-limiting range of CPT-11, a
prodrug form of the topoisomerase inhibitor Irinotecan that is widely
used to treat a variety of solid tumors. Antibiotic co-therapy and
specific inhibition of bacterial \u03b2-glucuronidase activity reduced
chemotherapy-induced GI toxicity in several animal models. Other studies
 have shown that depletion of NOX-inducing Lactobacillus species by
antibiotics, results in reduced tumoricidal activity of platinum based
drugs, which rely on induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to
mediate tumor cell killing. Similarly, the antitumor effects of
radiotherapy and several cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs such as
cyclophosomide (CTX), oxaliplatin, and CpG-ODN, are achieved in part by
an immune-mediated bystander effect that requires the recruitment and
activation of an intense inflammatory infiltrate to regress
tumors.&amp;nbsp;\nAs we learn more about how the microbiome affects
disease progression and response to treatments, the opportunity to
exploit the microbiome for therapeutic benefit is an exciting new
approach that should be explored.&amp;nbsp;\nProject Goals\nThe purpose
of this SBIR contract solicitation is to develop innovative technologies
 and methods designed to modulate the GI microbiota in order to enhance
the therapeutic efficacy of existing or novel cancer therapies, or
ameliorate side effects of these therapies. The goal is to develop
effective adjuvant strategies that specifically target critical
microbial activities or populations that affect drug efficacy and\/or
tolerability. Ultimately, this activity will accelerate the development
of novel strategies based on the rational targeting and manipulation of
human GI microbiome functions for the treatment of human tumors.\nTo
successfully meet this goal, applicants will need to demonstrate that
their approach accomplishes the specific perturbation or modulation of
the microbiome that is desired, and that these approaches have
demonstrable benefits in addressing a significant unmet medical need
relevant to cancer (e.g. reduction of off-target toxicity). Phase I
studies should focus on developing and refining the approach that will
be used to modulate GI microbiota or functions performed by the
microbiota (such as metabolic activity). Applicants should establish
appropriate criteria to benchmark or evaluate the success of their
approach, and these should be related to the expected level of
perturbation or modulation that is required to have therapeutic
benefits. Phase II studies should focus on demonstrating that the
approaches developed in Phase I studies are effective in an appropriate
in vivo model system. Lead candidates should be developed and tested for
 efficacy in appropriate animal models, and Phase II studies should also
 measure drug delivery (e.g., probiotics,&amp;nbsp; engineered phage,
lipids, nano-particles) and pharmacokinetic&amp;nbsp; targeting (e.g.,
reduction\/increase of specific microbial enzyme activity, signaling
ligand, or host interaction) in addition to measured endpoints of tumor
regression and\/or ablation in vivo.\nApplicants are not limited to
specific cancer types, but are required to identify and justify a cancer
 type and unmet medical need that can be addressed by their approach.
They should also provide a scientifically justified rationale for
exploring particular approach(es) for perturbing or modulating the
microbiome, and justify the choice of model system to evaluate their
approach(es).\nIt is anticipated that applicants will test perturbations
 of the GI microbiome, such as antibiotic treatments, bacteriophage
therapies, probiotic supplements, dietary metabolites, drug metabolizing
 enzymes, modulators of bacterial metabolism, and immunomodulators.
However, applicants are free to employ any approach.\nThe focus of this
contract topic is not to search for new mechanisms or effects by which
the microbiome affects cancer therapy or progression, but rather to
explore microbiome directed intervention strategies that have a rational
 basis. The contract topic is not intended to develop screening
approaches, though applicants may propose to refine or optimize lead
compounds or other agents designed to modulate or perturb GI
microbiota.\nPhase I Activities and
Deliverables\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

the desired perturbation or modulation of the microbiome to a level that
 can reasonably be expected to be have an impact on the efficacy of the
therapeutic interventions and demonstrate proof of concept for the
efficacy of their approach\no&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Offeror should

Health Disparity Research",
        "description": "Cancer health disparities (CHDs) are defined as
differences in the incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and mortality that
contribute to an unequal burden of cancer and represent a major public
health concern both nationally and globally. In the United States,
several racial\/ethnic populations demonstrate increased incidence
and\/or more aggressive disease for numerous cancer types. The causes of
 these CHDs are multifactorial, including differences in access to
health care, diet and lifestyle, cultural barriers, environmental
exposures, and ancestry-related factors. Recent data suggest that
biological factors may contribute to CHDs. The NCI specifically
encourages and funds investigations of such biological factors to better
 understand mechanisms that contribute to CHDs. One limitation in
conducting basic, translational, and clinical&amp;nbsp; research
investigating the causes of CHDs is a substantial lack of relevant in
vitro and in vivo-based models. The development and validation of
appropriate models to study underrepresented population groups would
greatly advance this field of research.\nProgram Goals\nThe primary goal
 of this topic is to develop new, commercially available models relevant
 to diverse racial\/ethnic populations.&amp;nbsp; These models may be
used to enhance research capabilities of basic scientists and\/or
provide novel tools to pharmaceutical companies for preclinical oncology
 studies. Establishing these novel models may influence CHD research in
multiple ways including 1) attracting additional researchers to this
largely underexplored area of research, 2) improving the quality and
acceptance of CHD research data, and 3) improving validation and
commercialization of cancer therapeutics relevant to diverse patient
populations. Lastly, achieving these goals will contribute to the
overarching goal of facilitating the reduction of CHDs.&amp;nbsp;
\nSmall businesses are invited to submit proposals to develop a panel of
 cell lines, primary cells, or patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse
models established from racially\/ethnically diverse patient
populations. Additionally, competitive applications may propose novel
genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models to investigate cancers or
co-morbid conditions that are more frequent and aggressive amongst
diverse racial\/ethnic populations.

Cancer cell lines and primary cancer cells: The scientific integrity of
cancer cell lines and primary cells is critical for maintaining high
standards in research.&amp;nbsp; Any cells established via this
solicitation must be fully confirmed through a rigorous and validated
authentication and be contamination-free. Furthermore, offerors must
have access to fully annotated tumor tissues from diverse racial\/ethnic
 populations with appropriate approval(s) in place (i.e., IRB).

 Mouse Models: PDX models have recently gained huge recognition in
clinical and preclinical oncology research. Molecular profiling studies
have shown the similarity between patient tumor and PDX models is
greater than between patient tumor and traditional cell lines.
Therefore, new initiatives have been proposed to use PDX models in a
number of clinically relevant research areas including characterization
of tumor heterogeneity, in vivo therapeutic target validation studies,
clinically relevant mechanism of action studies, and sensitivity and
resistance to therapy studies.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, PDX models have
even been suggested to be a useful tool to mimic human clinical trials
using animals. Similarly, offerors must have access to fully annotated
tumor tissues from diverse racial\/ethnic populations with appropriate
approval(s) in place (i.e., IRB).
\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; GEM
 Models: Numerous cancer types are more prevalent in specific
racial\/ethnic populations.&amp;nbsp; An example of one such disease is
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Although diagnosed less often,
breast cancer in African American women display different
characteristics compared to breast cancer in Caucasian women, including
earlier onset, less favorable clinical outcome, and an aggressive tumor
phenotype. The reason for this aggressive phenotype is currently widely
studied however progress is hampered by the lack of suitable TNBC model
systems. Development of GEMs (including knock-in mice, knock-out mice,
and mice with chemically induced mutations) to study cancers
disproportionately effecting racial\/ethnic populations would advance
the field.&amp;nbsp; Offerors must provide data or cite literature
justifying the GEMs proposed and have relevant technical expertise.

        "topic_name": "Cell-Free Nucleic Acid-Based Assay Development
for Cancer Diagnosis",
        "description": "The evidence that cell-free circulating DNA is
present in cancer patient\u2019s blood was first reported over half
century ago.&amp;nbsp; Since then studies that addressed the clinical
significance of the cell free DNA quantification in plasma\/serum for
cancer diagnosis have grown steadily.&amp;nbsp; Research findings
indicated that most patients with solid tumors in lung, breast,
prostate, colon, cervix, ovary, testes, and bladder have increased DNA
levels that allow for discriminating patients with malignancies from
those with non-malignant disease.&amp;nbsp; The first application of
cell free circulating nucleic acids (cfNA) in the diagnosis and
prognosis of cancer was demonstrated in 1977 when higher level of
circulating DNA was detected in the serum of cancer patients; these
levels decreased in response to radiation therapy.&amp;nbsp;
\n&amp;nbsp;\nIn recent years, it has been recognized that circulating
DNA may be altered in fragmentation pattern, microsatellite stability,
and DNA methylation. In addition, the cfNA sequences may be mutated and
tumor-specific allowing for increased sensitivity and specificity in
evaluation and detection of cancer compared to mere quantification of
cfNA levels.&amp;nbsp; Besides circulating cell free DNA, evidence has
indicated that tumor-derived RNA, (especially the quantification of the
tumor-derived microRNA in plasma\/serum) may be an excellent biomarkers
for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore,
alterations of cfNA are also found in other sources of body fluids or
effusions such as urine or sputum.&amp;nbsp; Clearly, cfNA as a
biomarker, which is easily accessible, reliable, and reproducible, can
offer many advantages in their implementation into clinical
use.\n&amp;nbsp;\nTo date, however, there are no currently effective
cfNA-based assays that are approved for clinical use in the diagnosis or
 prognosis of cancer. The low abundance of cfNA from all body fluids and
 effusions remains a major challenge in the assay development.&amp;nbsp;
 Many early developments need to be further verified and validated
before they can be translated to clinical use. With the latest
technology advancement in sample collection, processing, and analysis
for nucleic acids, the likelihood of clinical utilization of cfNA
becomes more reachable.&amp;nbsp; \n&amp;nbsp;\nThe purpose of this
initiative is to provide much needed support for the development of a
cfNA-based assay for cancer diagnosis and\/or prognosis.&amp;nbsp; The
selected applicants will develop an assay for detection of cancer or its
 subtype, so that cancer or subtypes can be identified
specifically.&amp;nbsp; Since a single alteration in cfNA may not be
sufficient to detect a specific cancer, offerors are encouraged to use a
 panel of cfNA alterations that could be more robust for their assay
development.&amp;nbsp; The cfNA alterations may include, but not limited
 to, cfNA concentration, fragmentation pattern, microsatellite
stability, and DNA methylation, tumor-specific sequences, DNA mutations
or tumor-derived RNA.&amp;nbsp; The sources for cfNAs can be from
plasma, serum, urine, sputum or other types of body fluids or
effusions.&amp;nbsp; In Phase I, the development of molecular diagnostic
 assay should focus on proof of concept.&amp;nbsp; In Phase II, the
assay developed in Phase I will be validated in the clinic setting under
 a plan developed with the NCI project officer.\nProgram Goals\nThe goal
 of the project is to develop a cfNA-based assay for clinical use in the
 evaluation of cancer diagnostics, prognostics, and response to therapy.
 The levels of sensitivity and specificity required will depend on the
clinical question and unmet need the assay is attempting to
answer.&amp;nbsp; The assay may also be used to provide a better
mechanistic understanding of tumor development and progress with the
idea that this knowledge may lead to better therapeutic targets and
improve patient outcome.&amp;nbsp; Preference will be given to the
assays that are platform driven, meaning that the technology platform
should be portable and easily used for diagnosis of multiple cancer
types.\n&amp;nbsp;\nTo apply for this topic, offerors need to outline
and indicate the clinical question and unmet clinical need that their
assay will address. Offerors are also required to use validated cfNA
markers.&amp;nbsp; This solicitation is not intended for biomarker
discovery.&amp;nbsp; \n&amp;nbsp;\nPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Select one or a set of validated cfNA markers with samples of a choice
(e.g., plasma, serum or\/and urine) for detection of a cancer or subtype
 (e.g., breast cancer or triple negative breast cancer).&amp;nbsp; If
novel or proprietary markers are used, offerors must show that the
markers have been
validated.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Develop an assay to identify these markers effectively to distinguish
the cancer samples from healthy samples.&amp;nbsp; The offerors should
also demonstrate that the assay is able to differentiate the cancer from
 other cancer types.\n\nDemonstrate high reproducibility and accuracy
with the assay.\nDemonstrate high specificity and sensitivity of the
assay.&amp;nbsp; Specificity and sensitivity will depend on the
application (e.g., high specificity will be required if the assay is
used to provide specific molecular information for the lesion that was
detected by CT imaging).\nDeliver to NCI the SOPs of the cfNA-based
assay for cancer
diagnosis.\n\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Demonstration of a plan that is necessary to file a regulatory
application.\n&amp;nbsp;\nPhase II Activities and Expected
Deliverables\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDemonstrate the assay that enables a test to
 be finished within one day.\nValidate the assay in the clinical
setting.\nSubmit a regulatory application to obtain approval for
clinical application.\n",

        "topic_name": "Companion Diagnostics for Cancer
Immunotherapies",
        "description": "The field of cancer immunotherapy has expanded
rapidly over the last few years with the development of several new
immunomodulatory agents that have shown promising clinical
results.&amp;nbsp; As one example, in 2011, the FDA approved a
therapeutic antibody for the treatment of melanoma, ipilimumab
(YERVOY\u00ae), which blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), a
 receptor found on T-cells that downregulates the immune
system.&amp;nbsp; In 2014, the FDA approved another agent for the
treatment of melanoma, pembrolizumab (KEYTRYDA\u00ae), which is the
first approved therapeutic antibody targeting the programmed cell death
protein 1 (PD-1), another T-cell receptor that plays a role in immune
inhibition.&amp;nbsp; These two therapeutic antibodies are
representative of a major class of cancer immunotherapies known as
immune checkpoint inhibitors, and several other therapeutic agents are
currently in development targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, and other immune
checkpoint proteins.&amp;nbsp; Other major classes of cancer
immunotherapies currently being developed include therapeutic cancer
vaccines, as well as therapeutic approaches that involve ex vivo
manipulation and engineering of immune cells, including chimeric antigen
 receptor (CAR) therapy.\nCancer immunotherapies offer several
advantages over current standard-of-care cancer treatments, including
the potential to eradicate cancer cells not visible to the surgeon, as
well as disseminated metastases that remain undetectable using current
imaging modalities.&amp;nbsp; Immunotherapy approaches may also prove
effective at targeting slowly dividing or quiescent tumor cells that do
not respond well to chemotherapy and\/or radiation, and certain
immunotherapy approaches are expected to suppress re-emergence of the
cancer (following initial treatment) by exploiting the immune
system\u2019s memory.&amp;nbsp; In fact, early results have shown
positive and dramatic clinical outcomes for some of the more recent
cancer immunotherapies, even in patients with advanced disease; however,
 it is often the case that only a subset of patients respond to such
therapies for reasons that are often poorly understood.&amp;nbsp;\nAs
the field of cancer immunotherapy continues to evolve, and as more
cancer immunotherapies advance through clinical development, there will
be an increasing need for companion diagnostic assays capable of
predicting responders (and non-responders) to cancer
immunotherapies.&amp;nbsp; Moreover, such assays will become critically
important as these therapies are eventually utilized as part of routine
clinical practice.\nProgram Goals\nThe goal of this contract topic is to
 develop companion diagnostic assays and technologies capable of
identifying individual patients for whom a particular cancer
immunotherapy regimen will be safe and effective.&amp;nbsp; This
includes cancer immunotherapies that have already received marketing
approval from the FDA, as well as cancer immunotherapies currently in
clinical development.&amp;nbsp; This topic is specifically intended to
address cancer immunotherapies that depend upon eliciting an immune
response.&amp;nbsp; Projects that do not meet this requirement will not
be considered responsive.&amp;nbsp; For example, a monoclonal
therapeutic antibody that exerts a direct antitumoral effect either by
neutralizing the antigen or by activating signaling pathways within the
target tumor cell, but does not elicit an immune response for its
clinical activity, is not considered an immunotherapy and would not be
considered responsive.\nThe goal of this contract topic is NOT to
solicit any particular technology or approach, i.e., this contract topic
 is technology agnostic.&amp;nbsp; Technologies employed may include,
but are not limited to, genetic analysis, other molecular diagnostic
approaches, cell culture and cell expansion technologies, imaging
modalities, radio-labeling approaches, and data
science\/analytics.&amp;nbsp; This contract topic is specifically
intended to support the development of assays that provide predictive
and\/or prognostic information for a specific cancer
immunotherapy.&amp;nbsp; Projects that do not meet this requirement will
 not be considered responsive.&amp;nbsp; For example, development of an
assay for the sole purpose of measuring whether an agent modulates its
intended molecular target (e.g., pharmacodynamic assay) would not be
considered responsive.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, development of an assay for
providing information that is useful in cancer diagnostics or
prognostics but not in determining the safe and effective use of a
therapeutic product\/regimen would also not be considered
responsive.&amp;nbsp; Noninvasive and minimally invasive sampling
methods (e.g., body fluids and mouth swab) are preferred.&amp;nbsp;
Other sampling methods are acceptable if they provide significantly
improved predictive value, accuracy, and clinical applicability.\nPhase I
 Activities and Expected Deliverables\n\nDevelop a working companion
diagnostic test for a specific cancer immunotherapy regimen, which meets
 the criteria described above\nCharacterize the variation,
reproducibility, and accuracy of the test, and implement a QA\/QC
plan\nDemonstrate suitability of the test for use in the clinic, and
conduct benchmarking studies against current tests (if available);
algorithms must be tested with datasets other than those used for their
development\nIn cases where a companion diagnostic test is proposed for a
 specific immunotherapeutic that is not yet commercially available
(i.e., approved for marketing), the applicant must provide proof of
collaboration or partnership with the entity that is developing the
therapeutic agent or with an established diagnostic company\nAll
offerors must establish a collaboration or partnership with a diagnostic
 and\/or pharmaceutical company and\/or clinical\/research institution
that can provide relevant clinical trial specimens; offerors must
provide a letter of support from the partnering organization in the
Phase II application\nDeliver the SOP of the working test to NCI for
evaluation\n\nPhase II Activities and Expected
Deliverables\n\nIncorporate the assay into a standard kit for clinical
testing and eventual distribution and sale\nDemonstrate clinical utility
 and value by testing sufficient numbers of patients from multiple sites
 to unequivocally demonstrate statistical significance with regard to
patient selection for the therapy\nIf the primary conclusions reached
during the Phase I studies were based on animal experiments or ex vivo
modeling, then a correlation study between these models and treatment in
 human subjects is expected\nEstablish marketing partnership or alliance
 with the company developing the therapy, unless the therapy is already
approved for marketing\nIt is preferred that the test be performed in at
 least one independent CLIA-certified laboratory\nDeliver the final SOP

\u201ctoxicity\u201d \u2013 caused by pharmaceutical or environmental
compounds are a major cause of drug development failure and public
health concern. Methods to evaluate the potential of chemical compounds
to induce toxicity are based largely on animal testing, are
low-throughput and expensive while giving little insight into mechanisms
 of compound toxicity, and have not changed appreciably in the last 50
years despite enormous advances in science. Multiple efforts, including
Tox21 program in the U.S., REACH Program in the E.U., and multiple
industrial collaborations, are attempting to develop in vitro methods
using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cells to assess
chemical toxicity. Stem cells or iPSC-derived cell types have great
potential to provide more physiological relevance than
immortalized\/transformed cell lines and to provide larger quantities
and higher assay reproducibility than primary cells. These programs must
 assess toxicity potential in every organ system and identify pathways
and\/or targets affected.\nGiven the protean nature of these effects, it
 is likely that hundreds of in vitro assays will need to be developed
and evaluated for their ability to profile chemical effects on
particular cell types and pathways. Progress in the field is currently
limited by the relatively small number of pathways and cell types that
have been developed into high- throughput screening (HTS)-ready assays,
and the artificial nature of many of the assays that have been developed
 (e.g., immortalized\/transformed cell lines, heterologous expression
with lack of physiologically accurate regulation).\nThe development of
HTS-ready assays using stem cells or iPSC-derived cells, which can
report on particular pathways and cellular phenotypes across the full
spectrum of pathway space and toxicological outcomes, is needed. Such
assays would need to meet strict performance criteria of robustness,
reproducibility, and physiological relevance. The assays developed would

        "topic_name": "Development of Smart Plate Technology",
        "description": "Microtitre plates are nearly ubiquitous in many
life sciences laboratory settings, used as a standard tool to act as the
 vessel in which a wide variety of experiment types are
performed.&amp;nbsp; There are a variety of key parameters that dictate
the application a particular plate type will be used for, such as the
number of wells present on a plate, the color of the plate depending
upon the detection method to be used, the material the plate is made
from to ideally be as chemically inert as possible, the surface
treatment or coating of the wells within a plate geared towards a
specific experiment type and other parameters for more specialty plate
types.\nOne nearly universal parameter regardless of plate type is that
these plates are typically assumed to be a consumable product, used once
 and then discarded, making them in effect a disposable item.&amp;nbsp;
Depending on the laboratory in question, it is not uncommon for
thousands if not tens of thousands of these plates to be consumed and
discarded within a single year.&amp;nbsp; Given the disposable nature of
 these parts, they have been manufactured with the idea that each plate
will be a consumable product, and are typically made out of a variety of
 polymers using injection molding techniques, most commonly polystyrene
and polypropylene.&amp;nbsp; Given the consumable nature of the product
and the materials used to manufacturer them on a large scale at low
cost, the typical features that distinguish one plate from another
typically come down to the physical properties of the materials the
plates are made of and any additional additives to them, potentially
limiting the plate from being anything more than a vessel for an
experiment.\nOver the last ten years, High-Throughput Experimental
Sciences (High-Throughput Screening) have evolved at a very rapid pace-
mostly enabled by ever more sensitive assay constructs, and the
evolution of detection and miniaturization schemes. Ten years ago a
typical high-throughput assay would have 2-3 reagent constituents and a
single absorbance or fluorescence-based readout. Today, modern screening
 facilities are commonly running very high-content, very data rich
assays with optical microscopy- based readouts.&amp;nbsp; These assays
produce terabytes of data leading to information that is uncovering
cellular behavior characteristics never before measured. These
progressive steps have far out-paced the evolution of the
microplate\u2014as a \u201cdumb\u201d article made of plastic. The
microplate component of the \u201csystem\u201d needs to be significantly
 updated in its\u2019 ability to harvest data, monitor environmental and
 atmospheric conditions, and report in real time any micro-climate
variances-which are critical systemic contributors to cell
performance.\nMain Requirements:\nThe purpose of this project is to
treat a microtitre plate not as a disposable product meant to act as a
vessel for one experiment, but instead to potentially be a resource that
 can be used multiple times against a variety of different
experiments.&amp;nbsp; Instead of limiting these plates to only being a
variety of plastics with a lifespan of one use, if different materials
and manufacturing techniques were utilized it could greatly impact what a
 plate could be used for.&amp;nbsp; Imagining the plate as being used
for a variety of monitor and control applications be built directly into
 the plate, such as temperature, relative humidity, CO2 and O2 levels
etc., instead of relying on external pieces of instrumentation to
perform these measurements.\nThe title of this solicitation is 'Smart
Plate' in reference to idea of the Smart Phone; once a platform was
built to create a phone that could perform a variety of functions as
opposed to simply one a huge amount of innovative ideas sprang
forth.&amp;nbsp; The goal of this SBIR solicitation is to do the same,
to fundamentally transform the idea of a microtitre plate from being a
single use vessel for an experiment to nearly becoming an instrument
itself which could provide more data about the samples under test to
actually providing measurements in the plate itself.&amp;nbsp; A key
goal tied to this is to break the idea of a plate being completely
disposable and instead treating each plate as a resource that can be
used many times.\nOne important point of this solicitation is that we
are NOT looking for the creation of a plate that only works with a
specific piece of instrumentation; the goal is a feature rich plate that
 can be used in a variety of existing instrumentation.\nPhase I

 The plate should provide the ability to work with different well types,
 shapes and materials.\n\u00a7&amp;nbsp; The wells do not necessarily
have to store sample; they could in fact be components that perform
various functions within a
plate.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Incorporates automated sensing of variables such as temperature,
relative humidity, volume, CO2, O2, pH and others of the samples within a
 well.&amp;nbsp; Not all variables are represented and the prototype is
not required to monitor all of these, these are just given as
examples.\n\u00a7&amp;nbsp; The values should ideally be accessible in
real time; so in the best case scenario the \u2018Smart Plate\u2019
would have some sort of integrated messaging capabilities over common
network protocols such as SMS, MMS, RFID or TCP\/IP.\n\u00a7&amp;nbsp;
If messaging is not an option in real time, the ability to store these
values to memory for retrieval at a later time is
required.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The device will ideally have some capacity to allow flow between wells
through microfluidic channels.&amp;nbsp; The pumps or devices used to
generate the flow are not required as part of the plate itself but
access ports should be
available.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

use of blood and all aspects of the management and safety of blood
resources. The NHLBI SBIR\/STTR program fosters basic, applied, and
clinical research on all product and service development related to the

 Phase IIB Programs\nThe NHLBI would like to provide notice of two SBIR
Phase IIB funding opportunities. This notice is for informational
purposes only and is not a call for Phase IIB proposals. This
informational notice does not commit the government to making such
awards to contract awardees.\nThe NHLBI offers Phase IIB opportunities
through the NHLBI Bridge Award and the NHLBI Small Market Award using
separate funding opportunity announcements (Bridge Award: RFA-HL-16-009;
 Small Market Award: RFA-HL-14-012). The purpose of the NHLBI Bridge and
 Small Market Awards is to accelerate the transition of SBIR Phase II
projects to the commercialization stage by promoting partnerships
between SBIR or STTR Phase II awardees and third-party investors and\/or
 strategic partners. The Small Market Award is designed to support
technologies addressing rare diseases or pediatric populations. The
Bridge and Small Market Awards encourage business relationships between
applicant small business concerns and third-party investors\/strategic
partners who can provide substantial financing to help accelerate the
commercialization of promising new products and technologies that were
initiated with SBIR\/STTR funding. In particular, applicants are
expected to leverage their previous SBIR\/STTR support, as well as the
opportunity to compete for additional funding through the NHLBI Bridge
Award or Small Market Award programs, to attract and negotiate
third-party financing needed to advance a product or technology toward
commercialization.\nBudgets up to $1 million in total costs per year and
 project periods up to three years (a total of $3 million over three
years) may be requested. Development efforts may include preclinical
R&amp;amp;D, which is needed for regulatory filings (e.g., IND or IDE)
and\/or clinical trials.\nAn SBIR Phase IIB Bridge or Small Market Award
 application must represent a continuation of the research and
development efforts performed under a previously funded SBIR or STTR
Phase II award. The NHLBI welcomes applicants previously funded by any
NIH Institute or Center or any other Federal agency, as long as the
proposed work applies to the NHLBI mission. Applications may be
predicated on a previously funded SBIR or STTR Phase II grant or
contract award. Applicants with Phase II contracts or awards from
another Federal agency must contact the NHLBI to ensure their
application can be received.\nApplicants are strongly encouraged to
contact Jennifer Shieh, Ph.D. at 301-443-8785 or jennifer.shieh@nih.gov
for additional information.\nLimited Amount of Award\nFor budgetary,
administrative, or programmatic reasons, the NHLBI may not fund a
proposal and does not intend to fund proposals for more than the budget
listed for each topic.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThis solicitation invites proposals

        "description": "Extra-anatomic bypass or vascular shunts divert
blood flow.&amp;nbsp; In congenital heart disease, these surgical
procedures are critical for management.&amp;nbsp; Children born with one
 functional ventricle or cardiac pumping chamber require two to three
major cardiac surgery procedures for palliation.&amp;nbsp; The
management goal is to divert systemic venous return (deoxygenated blood)
 from the heart directly to pulmonary artery circulation such that the
single ventricle can pump oxygenated blood returning to the heart from
the lungs to the body.&amp;nbsp; These multiple surgical procedures
carry significant morbidity and mortality, as well as incur substantial
hospital costs secondary to lengthy hospital stays.&amp;nbsp; A
minimally invasive transcatheter approach would revolutionize the
management of these children with congenital heart disease.&amp;nbsp; No
 commercial alternatives exist for off-label medical use.&amp;nbsp;
Children born with \u201csingle ventricle physiology\u201d represent
7.7% of congenital heart disease diagnosed in childhood and have a birth
 incidence of approximately 4\u20138 per 10,000.&amp;nbsp; In the United
 States, this represents approximately 2,000 children born each
year.&amp;nbsp; The commercial market is small enough to discourage the
early development costs of a transcatheter cavopulmonary bypass
endograft.&amp;nbsp; There is a considerable unmet need for a
purpose-built cavopulmonary anastomosis device.\n&amp;nbsp;\nProject
Goals\nThe goals of this project are to develop and test a transcatheter
 cavopulmonary bypass endograft prototype in vivo in Phase I, and to
develop a clinical device and obtain an FDA Investigational Device
Exemption (IDE) for first-in-human testing in the United States in Phase
 II.\n&amp;nbsp;\nPhase I Activities and Expected Deliverables\nExpected
 deliverables are transcatheter endografts to be delivered using
conventional interventional cardiovascular techniques including guiding
catheters or sheaths, trans-lesional guidewires, and balloon-expandable
or self-expanding delivery systems. Conventional and novel approaches
are welcomed.\n&amp;nbsp;\nSpecific requirements of the endografts
include:\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Delivery systems (10-12 French or
smaller);\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Sufficient radial force to resist elastic recoil (with specific focus
at anastomosis
site);\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Nominal calibers suitable for the most common
lesions;\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Freedom from \u201cpull-through\u201d of the anastomosis once deployed;
 and\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Accommodation for growing children (ultimately dilatable to adult size
vessels).\n&amp;nbsp;\nProposed endograft nominal geometry should be
diameter 10-14mm, length range 25-50mm, and delivery system 10-12 French
 or smaller. The radial hoop strength of the deployed device should
approach that of commercial endovascular stent grafts such as Gore
Viabahn or Atrium iCast. Percutaneous vascular access routes would be
trans-venous.&amp;nbsp; The implant and the delivery system should be
conspicuous under the intended image-guidance modality; MRI
compatibility is considered important.&amp;nbsp; Offerings should
specifically provide the high radial force required to overcome
immediate recoil of the intended applications, and should allow
\u201cdirect stent\u201d treatment technique.\n&amp;nbsp;\nConsiderable
detail should be supplied about the intended mechanical and biological
performance of the graft-pulmonary anastomosis, including resistance to
inadvertent separation and pull-through, hemorrhage, thrombosis,
neointimal overgrowth, angulation, distortion or failure by patient and
cardiovascular motion, and anticipated flow
characteristics.\n&amp;nbsp;\nPhase I should focus on mechanical and
biological performance of the proposed endograft, taking into account
the mechanical strength required for the application; geometry of the
access vessels and geometry and morphology of target vessels;
\u201cgrowth\u201d accommodation to achieve larger size and delivery,
implantation, and visualization strategies.\n&amp;nbsp;\nAt the
conclusion of Phase I, a candidate device design should be selected for
clinical development based on in vivo performance of a mature prototype
resembling a final design. Consideration for transition to Phase II
funding will include progress toward regulatory clearance. Consideration
 may include the status of the contractor\u2019s interactions with
the&amp;nbsp;Food and Drug Administration (FDA);&amp;nbsp;therefore,
contractors are encouraged to provide a detailed report of pre-IDE
interactions with the FDA identifying requirements for IDE development
under Phase II, including the summary of mutual understanding, if
available.&amp;nbsp;NHLBI encourages contractors to consider requesting
designation to the FDA\u2019s Expedited Access for PMA Devices (EAP)
program
(http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/downloads\/MedicalDevices\/DeviceRegulationandGuidance\/GuidanceDocuments\/UCM393978.pdf)
 during the Phase I award period.&amp;nbsp;\nThe sponsoring NHLBI
laboratory is willing to perform a limited number in vivo
proof-of-principal experiments in swine (by mutual agreement) to confirm
 mechanical performance.\n&amp;nbsp;\nPhase II Activities and Expected
Deliverables\nThe activities in Phase II should align with the required
testing and development milestones agreed upon with the FDA in Phase I.
The device should fit the specifications as described in the Phase I
Activities and Expected Deliverables. The offeror should provide clear
project milestones.\n&amp;nbsp;\nAt the conclusion of Phase II, the
offeror should submit an IDE for a US-based first-in-human research
protocol, involving at least 10 subjects.\n&amp;nbsp;\nIf the IDE is not
 granted during Phase II, the offeror must provide an FDA response that
indicates that the specific deficiencies are limited to Current Good
Manufacturing Design Verification and Validation, and that the
offeror-proposed plan to address these deficiencies would be considered
acceptable.\n&amp;nbsp;\nOfferors are encouraged to consider the NHLBI

significant challenge to many existing therapies and as a potential
barrier to the development of new therapies.&amp;nbsp; For example,
despite improved survival from cancer, chemotherapy-induced
cardiotoxicity has emerged as a significant problem.&amp;nbsp;
Cardiovascular complication, particularly heart failure, is an important
 cause of morbidity and mortality among cancer survivors.&amp;nbsp; In
small studies, cardioprotective strategies against cancer
therapy-induced cardiac dysfunction are effective if implemented early
at the subclinical phase.&amp;nbsp; However, detection of the frequency
of subclinical disease and subsequent ability to protect against further
 functional decline are limited by inadequacy of current technologies to
 accurately assess and monitor changes in cardiac structure and
function.&amp;nbsp; Novel non-invasive strategies that detect early
subclinical changes in cardiac structure, function, and\/or tissue are
needed to improve detection and monitoring of cardiac injury in order to
 improve cardioprotection and effectiveness of cancer therapeutics or
other toxic exposure.&amp;nbsp; Studies that demonstrate increased
sensitivity and precision of existing or enhanced imaging technologies
with respect to normal and altered cardiac structure, function,
energetics, and metabolism are sought.&amp;nbsp; Pre-clinical or patient

Use Disorder",
        "description": "Background\nEfforts to develop medications for
the treatment of alcohol use disorder have expanded rapidly in recent
years. Developing novel compounds for alcohol treatment is high priority
 for NIAAA Medications Development Program. Three agents directed at the
 addictive behavior in the use of alcohol \u2014disulfiram, naltrexone,
and acamprosate\u2014are now approved for use in the United States and
many other countries. Still, these medications do not work for everyone.
 Because of this, further research is needed to develop additional
medications to treat Alcohol Use Disorder and organ damage caused by
alcohol consumption.\nDuring the past decade, many new targets in the
brain and liver have evolved that alter alcohol-seeking and drinking
behavior. Brain effects and behavior may be influenced by agents
directed at CRF, adrenergic, opioid kappa, vasopressin V1b, NK1, orexin,
 NPY, NOP, glutamate mGluR2\/3, mGluR5, GABAa \u03b1-1 and \u03b1-5
receptors. Several intracellular targets in additional (peripheral)
organs have also been identified that alter outcomes of chronic alcohol
use, including ALDH-2; PKC; PPARg; epigenetic modulators, (HDAC
inhibitors, methylases, demethylases, and microRNAs); rapamycin complex
1; and GDNF. Tissue damage induced by the influence of alcohol or
acetaldehyde on any of the above have serious negative consequences
including development of steatohepatitis, cirrhosis or hepatocellular
carcinoma.&amp;nbsp; Agents affecting these, and any other validated
targets, may be synthetically derived or developed from plant
materials.\nSummary\nThis solicitation seeks to support the preliminary
work required for the development of novel compounds to interact with
recently identified targets to alter alcohol-seeking, drinking behavior
and\/or organ tissue damage caused by excessive alcohol
consumption.&amp;nbsp;\nProject Goals\nThe goal of this solicitation is
to provide support for the development of novel therapeutic agents to
treat alcohol use disorder and tissue damage caused by excessive alcohol
 consumption.&amp;nbsp;\nPhase 1 Activities\nIf compounds have not yet
been identified, activities include conducting high-throughput screening
 of libraries for novel compounds for further development. For
identified candidate compounds, conducting preclinical animal studies to
 demonstrate proof of concept and safety; drug formulation and
pharmacokinetic testing; drug optimizations and GMP manufacturing;
IND-directed animal toxicology.\nPhase 1 Expected

Deliverables\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Complete IND-enabling experiments and assessments according to the plan
 developed in Phase I (e.g., demonstration of desired function and
favorable biochemical and biophysical properties, PK\/PD studies, safety
 assessment, preclinical efficacy, GMP manufacturing, and commercial
assessment). The plan should be re-evaluated and refined as
appropriate.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Develop and execute an appropriate regulatory strategy. If warranted,
provide sufficient data to file an IND or an exploratory IND for the
candidate therapeutic agents (i.e., oncologic indications for
CSCs).\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

 is now optimized to control HIV-1 replication long-term, but the virus
remains integrated into the host genome in a latent form and poses a
threat for re-emergence. In search for more potent therapeutic agents
geared towards HIV cure, newly developed chimeric nucleases, which allow
 the precise modification of viral and human genomes, have recently been
 explored for HIV reservoir elimination. These designer enzymes have the
 ability to disrupt the integrated HIV genome by double-stranded DNA
break, so integrated proviruses become permanently defective, and to
modify host genes essential for HIV replication, so cells become
resistant to HIV infection.&amp;nbsp; The gene-editing enzymes currently
 available to the scientific community are zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs),
 transcription activator like-effector nucleases (TALENs), homing
endonucleases, and clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic
repeats (CRISPR)\/Cas9.&amp;nbsp; Each of these restriction enzymes is
associated with unique strengths, but also with off-target
effects.\nProject Goals\nThe primary goal is to design improved
nucleases for disruption of integrated HIV provirus and\/or modification
 of host genes, so HIV replication is no longer supported.&amp;nbsp;
There is also a need for alternative delivery strategies for these
nucleases to substitute for lentiviral gene delivery or plasmid
transfections. An additional goal is to evaluate off-target effects and
immune responses induced by the delivered nucleases and their
vectors.&amp;nbsp;\nPhase 1 activities may

to overcome in evaluating strategies to cure HIV infection is the lack
of a simple method for quantifying changes in the size of the latent
reservoir of replication-competent HIV in resting CD4+ memory T cells in
 individuals on highly effective antiretroviral therapy. Most of the HIV
 DNA in these cells represents defective virus; less than 0.01% of
highly purified resting CD4 cells harbor replication-competent
provirus.&amp;nbsp; As a result, PCR-based methods tend to over-estimate
 the size of the reservoir and do not correlate with the number of cells
 producing functional virus in a viral outgrowth assay. However, viral
outgrowth assays are labor-intensive and require large volumes of
blood.\nProject Goal\nThe goal of this project is to design a
high-throughput assay platform that can be used to reproducibly quantify
 changes in the size of the replication-competent latent HIV reservoir
in resting CD4+ memory T cells isolated from individuals on highly

 mortality and morbidity in HIV-infected individuals. With successful
therapy HIV RNA becomes undetectable, but drug resistance may
occur.&amp;nbsp; Specific HIV mutations are associated with resistance
and these mutations can be detected through standard genotypic
resistance tests, which have the ability to detect mutations only when
they are present in approximately 20% of the virus population within an
individual. Importantly, it is now known that the presence of certain
resistance mutations, even at very low concentrations within a
patient\u2019s virus population (1% or more), can contribute to
virological failure.&amp;nbsp; These drug resistant minor variants can
reflect the early emergence of acquired resistance during therapy, and
can also be transmitted to newly infected individuals. These minor
variants are not detected by standard drug resistance assays and methods
 to detect minor variants that contribute to HIV virological failure are
 needed.&amp;nbsp; These assays would need to detect mutations causing
resistance to each of the antiretroviral drug classes (NRTI, NNRTI, PI

least 95% and specificity at least 98%, but the method must also yield
quantitative results, showing the percentage of each resistant variant

 mutations and methods that collect full sequences are both acceptable.
For methods that detect point mutations, a set of relevant mutations
should be proposed in the application, but will be finalized in
cooperation with DAIDS program staff.&amp;nbsp; The method must be

cases have been occurring in many high endemic countries that have
limited resources to identify and diagnose patients. Standard diagnostic

diagnosis and clinical management of infectious diseases require the
direct assessment of a patient\u2019s symptoms, vital signs, and often
the collection and analysis of clinical specimens by health care
practitioners, usually in a health care setting.&amp;nbsp; Recent
scientific advances in mobile and remote monitoring technologies have
enabled home-based telemonitoring of multiple physical parameters in
patients with chronic medical conditions including cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. Additionally, advances in
rapid diagnostic platforms to detect pathogens have also been recently
realized.&amp;nbsp; There is now a unique opportunity to leverage and
integrate the advances made in these two areas of research and their
associated technologies and to apply them to the development of portable
 and continuous monitoring systems to revolutionize the early detection,
 progression, and\/or effects of treatment of patients with infectious
diseases.\nThe emerging development of portable monitoring devices and
technologies have yet to be applied to infectious diseases and may have a
 significant impact on clinical management. Systems that are able to
remotely monitor and report physiological status with minimally-invasive
 specimen collection would be useful ways to inform and support the
clinical management of disease, e.g., in premature infants at risk for
(or already diagnosed with) RSV, in elderly individuals with chronic
illness.&amp;nbsp; Remote monitoring of patients for the occurrence or
worsening of an infectious disease may result in early clinical
intervention and optimize the use of available therapies.&amp;nbsp; Such
 \u201creal-time\u201d monitoring of symptoms and\/or disease
progression would also add value by avoiding unnecessary trips to the
ER\/physician, and reducing healthcare costs.&amp;nbsp; While this type
of monitoring system is envisioned to be broadly applicable, some
patient populations (infants, elderly adults, and immunocompromised
individuals) may have greater benefit as they may not show symptoms on
examination, yet they may have an increased chance of developing
infections due to recent medical procedures or to rapid worsening of a
previously diagnosed infectious disease.\nProject goal\nThe overall goal
 of this solicitation is to develop a device that can, in a non-clinical
 setting, monitor and report data that reflects the emergence and\/or
progression of an infectious disease.&amp;nbsp; The complexity of such a
 device, and its operation, should allow for its use in patient
environments such as a home or a nursing facility and be capable of
communicating \u201cactionable\u201d data to professional healthcare
workers.&amp;nbsp; Ideally, such a device would have an integrated
architecture consisting of a physiological monitoring component, and\/or
 a specimen collection apparatus with equipment to analyze the sample,
and a communications functionality for data transmission; however, the
capability for specimen collection is not required for applications that
 involve physiological measurements only (i.e. that do not require
evaluation of analytes).&amp;nbsp; A highly desirable feature for a
device that requires sample collection might be a visual menu that
provides simple instructions for outpatient specimen collection when
needed, so that family members or care providers could support the
analytical device with minimal training.&amp;nbsp; The types of
information to be collected may include, but are not limited to:
physiological measurements (vital signs), analytes (biomarkers) that are

        "topic_name": "Innovative Oral Formulations for Anti-Infective
Drugs",
        "description": "Background\nThere is a persistent need to
develop alternative, simple to administer formulations of FDA approved
anti-infective agents for use by children and by adults who have
difficulty taking traditional tableted drugs.&amp;nbsp; These
formulations will simplify administration for caretakers and patients
and ensure compliance. \nThere are few child-friendly formulations of
pediatric anti-infective medications available to practitioners in the
U.S. and especially globally. It is standard practice to cut or crush
un-scored adult tablets and administer them to children in juice or
other palatable substances, such as food. This practice has significant
potential to deliver incorrect and highly variable doses to children,
contributing to ineffective treatment. For some adult patients,
especially those with difficulty swallowing or those with dementia or
other mental impairments, taking standard pills or syrups may be
problematic and also affect compliance.\nFor infectious diseases,
completion of drug therapy is critical to assure cure and reduce
development of resistance. Resistance often develops when therapy is
terminated early or drugs taken intermittently, rather than the
prescribed daily doses. Furthermore, for infectious diseases that
require long term dosing such as tuberculosis or HIV\/AIDS, there is
evidence of decrease of patient compliance as time goes on, particularly
 if drugs are not very palatable. Customized oral formulations are
needed that facilitate long term compliance and are of sufficient
stability to be suitable for use in resource limited
countries.\nExamples of the types of oral formulations that may address
these issues include, but are not limited
to:\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Oral
thin-films\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Porous, chewable matrix systems (scorable \u201cTaffy\u201d based on
patient
weight)\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Candy-like formulations,&amp;nbsp; including gummies and jellybeans\nIt
 is recognized that these formulations may only be suitable for highly
active anti-infective drugs.\nWhile consideration of pediatric
applications is a recent regulatory requirement for novel drugs in
general, this requirement does not apply to a majority of anti-infective
 drugs that are already off patent and therefore, development of new
formulations should be an attractive commercial goal for small
businesses. In addition, offering these easier to take formulations to
adults who have difficulty taking oral tablets would further expand the
utility of these innovative dosing forms, as well as facilitate overall
compliance with taking medicines.\nProject Goal\nThe goal of this
project is to develop innovative oral formulations for FDA approved
anti-infective agents (antibacterials, antifungals, antiparasitics, and
antivirals, including anti-retrovirals for HIV\/AIDS) other than
nanoparticles or pills to facilitate administration to patients who are
either too young or have difficulty taking oral medications.&amp;nbsp;
The final product should be simple to manufacture, stable under ambient
conditions and ready for testing in Phase I bioequivalence and PK
studies.\nPhase I activities include but are not limited
to\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

        "topic_name": "Development of Primer and Reference Tool to
Assess Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome ",
        "description": "Objective\nThis topic addresses the demand to
promote awareness and knowledge of the best practice in management of
Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). The need is caused by clinical rigor
 and raised concerns among neonatal and pediatric practitioners
regarding a constellation of various withdrawal symptoms and treatment
approaches. The ultimate goal of this solicitation is to develop a
skill-building Primer and Reference Tool to assist clinicians in
identifying, interpretation, scoring and responding to NAS symptoms
toward improving neonatal outcomes.\nBackground\nNAS is a group of
withdrawal problems that occur in a newborn who was exposed to addictive
 drugs while in the mother\u2019s&amp;nbsp;womb. NAS characterized by
gastrointestinal, respiratory, autonomic, and central nervous system
disturbances from drug withdrawal that affect critical regulatory areas
for postnatal life adaptation.&amp;nbsp; Withdrawal signs may develop in
 37% to 94% of neonates exposed by various addictive substances
including illegal drugs or prescribed analgesics and antidepressants.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\nIn the past decade, the use of
prescription opioids and the incidence of opioid addiction among women
of childbearing age increased substantially. According the American
Academy of Pediatrics, the number of opioid-dependent NAS diagnoses
increased threefold reaching more than 13,000 babies across the United
States annually. Currently, the consistent use of pain relievers with
other drugs become more common that causes the NAS symptoms to be more
severe and poorly manageable. At the consequence, newborns with NAS
present new challenges for the neonatal hospitals and may require
prolonged hospitalization in order to alleviate the symptoms. The
national health cost to care for such infants jumped from $190 million
in 2000 to $720 million per year in 2009. In addition, there is the
growing concern, that hospitals may discharge some newborns before the
symptoms appearance, if newborns were exposed by long-acting opioids
with five or more days to show signs of withdrawal.&amp;nbsp; These
newborns present the significant challenge for diagnostics at hospital
emergency rooms or out-patient pediatric units outside of the
nation\u2019s epicenters of drug abuse.\n&amp;nbsp;\nTo date, there is
neither a standard diagnostic tool, preventive treatment strategy, nor a
 comprehensive educational program to manage NAS. Among educational
resources, few existing online applications (Neonatal Drug Withdrawal
Protocol App, Kaiser Permanente; Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome CE581,
Nurse.com) are limited in the context and provide general text-based
information with no interactivity rather than helping practitioners to
adapt the clinical symptoms to the established diagnostic and treatment
guidelines. \n&amp;nbsp;\nResponding to the demand for NAS awareness and
 medical care standardization, the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA) supports development of a medical Primer and Reference Tool to
specifically address the information gap in this critical pediatric
health problem. With the long-term goal of improving neonatal health
care, NIDA is soliciting proposals for a SBIR contract to develop and
evaluate a bedside assisting App for NAS
management.&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\nCurrently, the modified Neonatal
Abstinence Scoring System (or Modified Finnegan Scoring system) is the
predominant scoring tool used in the United States. Despite of its
complexity and bulkiness as the 21-item related observation checklist,
the Modified Finnegan Scoring remains more comprehensive
system.&amp;nbsp; The value of NAS severity, calculated by this tool, is
 a critical feature for any NAS assessment which serves as the basis for
 treatment selection and start. Recently, the Modified Finnegan Scoring
was incorporated into the electronic medical record (EMR) platforms in
the national centers of pediatric care excellence and the nation\u2019s
epicenters of drug abuse. However, outside the recognized medical
centers, most nurses and pediatricians have little experience in NAS
evaluation and Finnegan Scoring. These hospital codes are unfamiliar
with the criteria of NAS and may give the neonatal an alternative
diagnosis that shares signs with NAS such as infection, hypoglycemia,
hypocalcemia, hyperthyroidism, intracranial hemorrhage, hypoxic-ischemic
 encephalopathy, and hyperviscosity. At presentation, signs of NAS vary
and usually include excessive cry, irritability, short sleep, tremors,
stiffened muscles, gastro-intestinal and respiratory problems. NAS
unawareness or different practice standards cases the number of
challenges in diagnostics and therapeutic
strategies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\nThus, the lack of the
standard management and bed-side references causes bias and subjectivity
 in NAS scoring and assessment. To address this problem, the new
electronic tool should adapt and unify the existing knowledge regarding
NAS risks, symptoms, Finnegan Scoring, diagnostic and therapeutic
approaches. &amp;nbsp;New tool is sought to better explain the
withdrawal symptoms in newborns and provide bed-side instructions how to
 assess the Modified Finnegan Score.&amp;nbsp; The primary target
audience for the proposed tool includes neonatal practitioners,
pediatricians, and nurses. However, the material are sought to be useful
 for a wide range of health care professionals&amp;nbsp; from family or
GYN physicians, pain prescription provides to medical and nurse students
 who wish to continue their medical carrier to pediatrics.\nPhase I
Activities and Expected Deliverables:\nTechnical
Requirements\n1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Assemble a consultant team and determine availability of data,

established practice or experience to contact consultative and CME
educational services, neonatal centers, hospitals, professional
associations and medical practitioners including but not limited to
neonatal providers, nurses, pediatricians, and pain prescription

 (e.g. Nebulizer, Vaporizer or Inhaler) ",
        "description": "Objective\nTo develop a pulmonary delivery
device that can administer therapeutic doses of the non-psychoactive
cannabinoid CBD. The ultimate goal is to generate a sufficiently
characterized clinical tool such that the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) would allow it to be used to evaluate the efficacy of inhaled CBD
as a therapeutic agent in clinical trials.\nThis opportunity is open to
all Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award-eligible
organizations. However, it is anticipated that a Small Business Concern
(SBC) best equipped to produce such a characterized device and data
package within the time and budget constraints might currently be
marketing a similar or related inhalation product.\nAspects of a Market
analysis\nThe NIDA foresees a niche for the SBC with a pulmonary CBD
delivery device that has previously successfully undergone Federal IND
review. This product would be marketed to clinical researchers wishing
to conduct clinical studies into potential therapeutic effects of CBD.
The SBC would supply the researchers with devices and allow them to
cross-reference the original IND in their own FDA application(s). All
proprietary information would be kept between the SBC and the
FDA.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Diversified Income Stream- Clinical researchers in the US (and beyond)
represent limited \/ no-competition market niche, protected by the costs
 involved in characterizing the device and obtaining an
IND.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 In a market where designs are rapidly evolving this representsa
situation where a stable device design is prized and minimal future
R&amp;amp;D investment will be
required.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Informing Product Development- Characterizing your existing product
will aid future design efforts and perhaps \u201cfuture-proof\u201d
against a scenario where greater regulatory oversight might require
characterization.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 \u201cFree\u201d Clinical Data Studies The product would be described
as a generic NIH device, butthe SBC would be welcome to reveal their
involvement in NIH clinical studies in their marketing
materials.\nBackground\nCBD is a compound found in marijuana that has no
 euphoric properties but appears to have other pharmacological
activities. Current understanding of CBD pharmacology is limited; a
number of laboratory studies have been conducted and a few have
progressed into early clinical phase investigations, the most successful
 demonstrating CBD as an anxiolytic agent. Potential applications for
the anxiolytic properties of CBD include reduction of craving and
relapse in Substance Use Disorders, and reduction of anxiety in
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. In addition, CBD is currently under
clinical investigation for the treatment of childhood intractable
epilepsies, where it is added to the existing medication regimen
(usually, to 2-3 other drugs).&amp;nbsp; However, CBD is well known as
an inactivator of drug metabolizing enzymes and so can significantly
disturb the patient\u2019s exposure to their current medications and
potentially contribute to serious drug interactions. If CBD is to be
administered via a pulmonary (inhaled) mechanism rather than via oral
route, the liver exposure would be much lower, resulting in less enzyme
inactivation and drug-drug interactions. Furthermore, inhaled CBD
provides 2-3x greater bioavailability and shows substantially lower
inter-dose and inter-subject variability than with oral administration.
when used in a clinical trial a pulmonary delivery device would result
in more reproducible CBD dosing, less risk of drug interactions and
ultimately less variable and more reproducible clinical data.\nProject
Overview\n\nThe solicitation is open to all small businesses.&amp;nbsp;
SBCs with similar \/ related existing technologies are especially
encouraged to apply.\nProducts based on herbaceous material will not be
acceptable, all formulations will need to be liquids or solids
manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practices
(cGMP).\nThe delivery device could be in the form of a vaporizer,
nebulizer, dry-powder inhaler or any other FDA-approvable pulmonary
delivery device.\nPhase 1 of the project characterizes the quantity and
reproducibility of CBD delivered in a single 5-second puff, as well as
the identities and the amounts of all other agents in the
vapor\/aerosol.\nAll components of the device and liquid are to be
manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) or when
such standards do not exist manufacturing should be performed according
to the \u201cspirit of GMP\u201d.&amp;nbsp;\nAnalytical Studies are to
generate Certificates of Analyses demonstrating an appropriate and
reproducible CBD output as well as quantities of all other emissions.
Studies are to be conducted by an ISO 17025 laboratory.&amp;nbsp;\nThe
Phase I deliverables also include the minutes of an FDA pre-IND
submission meeting outlining FDA expectations for any additional studies
 \/ data that would be required for a successful IND application.\nIf
selected to progress into phase II, the SBC is to conduct the studies
required by the FDA to achieve a successful IND to examine the
pharmacokinetics of CBD delivery by the device in normal healthy
adults.&amp;nbsp; In addition, in Phase II, a 10 person study would be
conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of single dose\/session
administration of CBD using the device. It is recognized that a
pharmacokinetic study may not always require an IND, but a protocol is
required for the FDA to consider the suitability of the data package for
 issuance of IND. Once the data package has been allowed for one study,
that IND can then be cross-referenced in future studies.\nIt is expected
 that the data from the pharmacokinetic study would be published in a
peer reviewed
journal).&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Phase II projects will also require elucidation of the strategy that
will be used to move the proposed research tool to a marketable product.
 Evidence of a track record of commercialization and \/ or commitment of
 additional investment from private sector or other non-SBIR funding
sources will be expected.\n\nPhase II would consist of studies aimed to
satisfy FDA requirements for issuing an IND and the conduct of a 10
person study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of single dose\/session
administration of CBD using the device. It is recognized that a
pharmacokinetic study may not always require an IND, but a protocol is
required for the FDA to consider the suitability of the data package for
 issuance of
IND.\n\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The SBC would agree to market this device as characterized (without
further change) to all clinical researchers who have been granted NIH
funds to conduct the relevant
studies.\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The device would be available for a sufficient period after the
completion of the project to allow clinical studies to be conducted
(i.e. 5-10
y).\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
The SBC would retain the proprietary data held within the Drug Master
File but would allow NIH researchers (and other customers) to cross
reference the original Investigational New Drug Application (IND) using
that data in order when seeking FDA approval for their study.\n\nThe
battery used in the device must be rechargeable using a USB port and not
 meet the definition of hazardous waste as described in 40 CFR 261,
subpart C.\nThe device should deliver at least 40 mg CBD to the vapor \/
 aerosol over 10 minutes of use&amp;nbsp;\nAvailability of other
formulations such as a placebo formulation would be desirable, but not
essential. If several formulations are proposed, the budget may
potentially be modified accordingly during the negotiation phase (if the
 government determines negotiations are necessary). A formulation that
contains a defined low amount of THC in combination with the required
CBD delivery would also be viable as an additional formulation, although
 NIDA would need to be the source of the THC during the course of the
contract.&amp;nbsp;\nPhase II would consist of studies aimed to satisfy
FDA requirements for issuing an IND and the conduct of a 10 person study
 to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of single dose\/session administration
 of CBD using the device. It is recognized that a pharmacokinetic study
may not always require an IND, but a protocol is required for the FDA to
 consider the suitability of the data package for issuance of
IND.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe Phase I contract proposal must

 description of the device appearance and characteristics, including
(but not limited to)\n\nThe liquid reservoir volume\nThe device
dimensions and weight\nAn image of the device\n\nInformation regarding
protections to prevent a user\u2019s exposure to the CBD containing
liquid.\nEstimation of the number of puffs per cartridge, tank fill or
disposable device (as appropriate) using a defined puffing topography
(see Phase I Activities and Expected Deliverables).\nEstimation of the
number of 5 sec puffs on a single battery charge (where applicable). The
 number of times a battery can be discharged to less than 20% of full

        "topic_name": "\u201cThe Pain Mobile\u201d: Remote Pain
Management System",
        "description": "Objective\nProvide in-home access to coordinated
 comprehensive pain treatment through a mobile treatment
platform.&amp;nbsp; This platform may range from a fully equipped mobile
 clinic, to a mobile extension of a traditional pain clinic, or a
virtual network of mobile treatment services.&amp;nbsp; Note that
opioids may be part of this comprehensive treatment plan and may be
prescribed, if warranted, but will not be delivered through the pain
mobile platform.\nBackground\nPain is a major health crisis in America,
where chronic pain afflicts nearly a third of our population.&amp;nbsp;
Opioids can be a powerful tool in fighting pain; however they are too
often used as substitute for a comprehensive interprofessional pain
treatment program.&amp;nbsp; Patients are merely sent home with a bottle
 of pills.&amp;nbsp; The result is pain is often inadequately treated
and opioids are over used.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\nIn an effort
to improve pain treatment and reduce dependence on opioids, NIDA is
soliciting applications to create a mobile pain management
system.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Core to this solicitation is the delivery of
 a comprehensive pain treatment system to a pain patient\u2019s home, as
 it is difficult for many pain patients to make numerous needed visits
to clinical settings. Opioids may be prescribed as part of this
comprehensive treatment plan, but will not be dispensed.&amp;nbsp; The
patients will have to get opioids from pharmacies (either in person or
via a delivery system).&amp;nbsp;\nThis \u201cpain mobile\u201d can be
an actual portable clinic that is equipped and staffed to treat pain.
Alternatively, it can be more of a virtual remote pain treatment system,
 where health care providers get to patients homes using various means
other than a devoted vehicle. It can also be a hybrid of these
approaches.&amp;nbsp; However, it is crucial that visits and treatments
are coordinated in a way that delivers comprehensive and appropriate
pain treatment.&amp;nbsp; This coordination can be done from the actual
pain mobile or via a remote site.\nThe health care providers that visit
the pain patients need to have appropriate training (e.g. nurse
practitioner); but they do not have to be
clinicians.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; However, it is essential that clinicians
 are involved in many aspects of the patients care, including
assessment, diagnosis, and management, planning, and prescribing of
drugs.&amp;nbsp; This clinician input can take many forms, and can
include occasional office visits by the patients and having the
clinician remotely see the patients using various telemedicine
technologies (e.g., Skype).\nIn many cases, as part of a complete pain
treatment program, we expect that various other health care providers
would visit the pain patients in a coordinated fashion.&amp;nbsp; These
may include acupuncturists, physical therapists, massage therapists,
cognitive\/behavioral psychologists and others depending on patient
needs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Again, these visits need to be coordinated,
and progress needs to be monitored.&amp;nbsp; Further, this treatment
systems needs to be flexible and change with the needs of the
patients.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\nGiven that the \u201cpain mobile\u201d
approach involves going to the patients\u2019 homes, it offers some
unique opportunities not available with visits to clinics.&amp;nbsp;
With home visits, it is possible to assess the home environment and also
 to educate patient and those living with the patient. As part of the
\u201cpain mobile\u201d program, we expect that at least one of the
health care providers that go to the patient\u2019s residence be trained
 to evaluate the living conditions of the patient and when appropriate,
suggest improvements that will allow the patient to function better in
their home environment despite their condition.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If
the patient is using opioid pain medications, how these drugs are stored
 and secured will be examined.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The health care
provider will also be expected to educate the pain patient and
co-inhabitants of the home about the safe use of
opioids.&amp;nbsp;\nWhile this is a small scale project, we would like
the chosen model to be economically viable and potentially
expanded.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; To make this more likely, the offeror must
 describe a plan of how they will make this project not only
self-sustaining, but also expandable.&amp;nbsp; Agreements with existing
 health care providers, health insurance companies, health services
providers or the like is required.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If the pilot
project funded under this contract is shown to be economically viable on
 a small scale, we envision that this will encourage provider partners
to expand this system within their existing networks, and thus expand
the impact of this effort.\nPhase I Activities and Expected

comprehensive pain

consultations and testing, the coordination plan of treatment delivery
(who goes where and when), the development of hardware and software

include measures of pain, depression, mood, function, level of use of
opioids, activity levels and other indicators of successful pain

        "topic_name": "Diagnostic Tools to Support the Elimination and
Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases ",
        "description": "Background\nNeglected tropical diseases (NTDs)
are bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections that disproportionately
affect poor and underserved populations around the world, and are
primarily associated with high levels of morbidity due to the chronic
nature of the infections. Adults affected by NTDs often have decreased
productivity. School aged children are also affected by NTDs, resulting
in decreased physical and scholastic performance.&amp;nbsp; A subset of
NTDs, including lymphatic filariasis (1 billion people at risk in 73
countries), onchocerciasis (120 M people at risk in 37 countries),
schistosomiasis (700 M at risk in 74 countries), trachoma (540 M at risk
 in 55 countries) and soil transmitted helminth (STH) infections (4
billion at risk, 1 billion infected, worldwide), can be targeted
effectively through mass drug administration (MDA). In recent years,
there have been significant increases in the number of countries
implementing public health programs to combat NTDs, and in the number of
 persons being treated for NTDs. This progress is the direct result of
generous donations of drugs from pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as
 funding support from the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID) and the UK Department for International Development (DFID),
among others. Reducing the morbidity caused by NTDs is an objective of
the U.S. Government Global Health Initiative (GHI) with specific targets
 for the global elimination of lymphatic filariasis and
trachoma.\nCurrently available laboratory and epidemiological tools to
achieve the new elimination goals set for several NTDs require
improvement. For example, there is significant geographic overlap in the
 distribution of most NTDs, but programs continue to use
disease-specific and labor intensive clinical or parasitologic exams for
 mapping and surveillance.&amp;nbsp; This approach does not maximize the
 limited resources available to these programs.&amp;nbsp; Treatment
drugs for some NTDs can cause serious adverse events if other infections
 are also present. For example, serious neurologic adverse events can
result when MDA takes place with the use of ivermectin in regions where
onchocerciasis and Loa loa overlap (i.e., Central and West
Africa).&amp;nbsp; An integrated diagnostic platform for NTDs could
produce significant cost-savings for mapping and surveillance and
improved safety for MDA programs.\n&amp;nbsp;Project
Goal&amp;nbsp;\nField-compatible antibody and antigen (as appropriate
for the particular disease, as delineated in the table below) tests can
be used to define treatment areas, guide MDA program implementation and
to conduct post-treatment surveillance. Development of multiplexed strip
 tests would facilitate integrated, cost-effective surveillance and
mapping

programs\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 the need&amp;nbsp; for rapid&amp;nbsp; determination of infection
prevalence in support of micro
mapping;\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 the detection of co-infections that hamper MDA activities (for example
lymphatic filariasis endemicity in areas where ivermectin has been
previously used for onchocerciasis MDA,&amp;nbsp; Loa loa infections in
areas endemic for
onchocerciasis);\n\u00b7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 epidemiological surveillance, evaluation of program impact through
serological monitoring, and surveillance for infection or exposure
following apparent interruption of transmission.\nThe proposed assays
should be developed towards use of a standard platform, therefore
opening opportunities for integrated surveillance for NTDs.\nPhase I
Activities and Expected
Deliverables&amp;nbsp;\n1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Prototype device or methodology for point of care application (field
compatible) for simultaneous or consecutive detection of one or more
NTDs. A rapid diagnostic, field compatible serological assay is highly
desirable.&amp;nbsp; Such a device will help identify infected persons
in specific areas, therefore facilitating fast mapping could be the
basis of program monitoring and evaluation activities. A desirable
prototype should include either two or more of the NTDs listed above,
including but not limited to:\n\u00a7&amp;nbsp; Schistosomiasis and
lymphatic filariasis\n\u00a7&amp;nbsp; Loa loa and
onchocerciasis\n\u00a7&amp;nbsp; Loa loa and LF\n\u00a7&amp;nbsp;
Schistosomiasis and intestinal helminth infections (e.g. Strongyloides
stercoralis)\n2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Determination
of basic assay performance characteristics: preliminary sensitivity and
specificity desired but not
required.\n3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Field
compatibility characteristics: performance outside a fully equipped
laboratory and the stability, shelf life, and storage requirements of
the tests.\nProjected Phase II activities\nPhase II activities for a
successful Phase I prototype will include expanded testing for
sensitivity and specificity, and small-scale production of beta
prototypes for field testing. Following this, modifications of the beta
prototypes towards a final field-compatible test will be done. Finally,
data will be generated to further characterize the test performance
characteristics and assay compatibility with NTD program needs for
mapping and program monitoring and evaluation, including post-treatment
surveillance.\nImpact\nDevelopment of improved diagnostic tools supports
 CDC\u2019s efforts to address lymphatic filariasis in the Americas and
the NTD GHI targets. These tools would also encourage the commitment of
donors and policy makers to NTD control and elimination programs by
allowing program integration across diseases and enhanced efficiency.
New devices or assays may provide more reliable detection of infection
rates, which would lead to increased confidence towards meeting public
health goals. Significant savings in human and financial resources could
 be obtained through the development of improved diagnostic
tools.\nCommercialization Potential\nNTDs are by definition neglected
and diagnostic tests for NTDS are not necessarily compatible with
standard commercialization strategies.&amp;nbsp; However, there is a
need for new diagnostic methods. Small businesses are the frontrunners
on developing novel technologies and approaches for addressing unmet
needs. Market opportunities arise from the presence of donors and policy
 makers already committed in NTD elimination and control efforts, who
could encourage manufacturers to promote production and commercial
availability of these devices.\nNational Center for Emerging Zoonotic
and Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)\nThe mission of the National Center for
 Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases aims to prevent disease,
disability, and death caused by a wide range of infectious diseases.
NCEZID focuses on diseases that have been around for many years,
emerging diseases (those that are new or just recently identified), and
zoonotic diseases (those spread from animals to people). NCEZID\u2019s
work is guided in part by a holistic \u201cOne Health\u201d strategy,
which recognizes the vital interconnectedness of microbes and the
environment. Through a comprehensive approach involving many scientific
disciplines, NCEZID can attain better health for humans and animals and
improve our environment.\nNCEZID\u2019s Web site:&amp;nbsp;

        "topic_name": "De novo assembly of arthropod genomes of public
health importance",
        "description": "Background\nLong range de novo genome assembly
from short sequence reads is still one of the greatest challenges in
genomics despite vast and rapid improvements in obtaining those short
reads.&amp;nbsp; Numerous viral, bacterial, and parasitic agents causing
 human and veterinary diseases are carried and transmitted by arthropods
 including but not limited to ticks, mosquitos, triatomids, sandflies,
mites, lice, and fleas. The prevalence, diversity, and range of these
arthropod disease vectors render them an important subject of study for
improving our understanding of their roles in human disease
transmission, and consequently for the prevention of those diseases. The
 impact of assembly of the human genome sequence on medicine has been
tremendous.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, high-quality genome assemblies of
arthropod vectors are a critical precondition to new approaches to
studying vector-pathogen interactions and for controlling vector
populations. Such genome assemblies will be used to underpin
demographic, phylogenetic, host\/parasite, and population genetic
analyses. Unfortunately, very few reference or even draft-quality
assemblies exist for arthropod vectors of public health importance, with
 the exception of species with small genomes like mosquitoes.&amp;nbsp;
This is true despite the huge economic and public health impacts of many
 other vector species. Assemblies of larger, more complex arthropod
genomes, such as ticks, were first proposed in 2006 (Lyme disease
vector) but they are still very poor despite their importance to public
health. A consequence of the lack of cost-effective assembly
technologies to complete even single sequences is that large-scale
comparative assembly efforts are virtually nonexistent. This is partly a
 consequence of the costs required to generate high-quality assemblies
for this massively diverse phylum, even as the cost per read has
declined.&amp;nbsp; However, the read length of efficient sequencers
with contemporary libraries is too short for effective construction of
chromosome length assemblies.&amp;nbsp; Higher order assembly requires
very expensive and cumbersome approaches that are still being applied to
 correction of the human genome sequence.&amp;nbsp; New
approaches&amp;nbsp; may substantially reduce the time and effort
required for higher order genome assemblies and thus make fuller and
more cost effective use of the short read sequence libraries which are
the norm for NextGeneration Sequencers but quite inadequate for
achieving the goal of accurate full genome assemblies. Currently genomes
 are often released as assemblies containing tens of thousands of
contigs (e. g., Rhodnius prolixus, the triatomine vector of Chagas
Disease, even at 8 X coverage has 58,559 contigs and 27,872
supercontigs).\nTwo recent Institute of Medicine of the National
Academies Workshops by expert panels have focused on the costs and
public health threats associated with vector-borne disease.&amp;nbsp;
The more general 2008 workshop was entitled \u201cVector-Borne Diseases,
 Understanding the Environmental, Human Health, and Ecological
Connections, Workshop Summary (Forum on Microbial Threats).\u201d And
published by the National Academy Press.&amp;nbsp; This was followed by
another more focused National Academy Press publication in 2011 o f a
workshop proceeding which was entitled \u201cCritical Needs and Gaps in
Understanding Prevention, Amelioration, and Resolution of Lyme and Other
 Tick-Borne Diseases: The Short-Term and Long-Term Outcomes - Workshop
Report.\u201d&amp;nbsp; These lengthy documents fully explore the public
 health problem, costs, and research directions needing effort in order
to reduce the health burden posed by vector-borne diseases.&amp;nbsp;
Suffice it to say, greater genetic understanding of the target species,
the focus of this solicitation, was fully addressed as a pressing need
in these publications.&amp;nbsp; Those same considerations apply to a
wide range of arthropods of veterinary and agricultural
importance.\nProject Goals\nThe goals of the proposed research are to
rapidly and cost-effectively assemble high-quality arthropod genomes de
novo. The innovation should ultimately enable large numbers of genomes
to be assembled in multi-megabase scaffolds rapidly and
affordably.&amp;nbsp; A scalable, parallelizable approach will enable
much broader surveys and targeted studies of arthropod genomes to better
 understand their role in disease transmission and myriad costs to
society. Technologies designed to meet these needs will need to employ
computational and assay-based innovations. Projects must start with
input DNA and yield assembled genomes, not just data from which assembly
 may be done eventually.&amp;nbsp; This will be the first such effort
attempted with large arthropod genomes for higher order and more
complete assemblies.&amp;nbsp; Technologies previously found to be
effective for human and alligator genome assemblies (e.g.,
Chromosome-scale shotgun assembly using an in vitro method for
long-range linkage ArXiv: 1502.05331v1 [q-bio.GN] 18 Feb 2015) using
emerging sequencing and bioinformatic technologies may be used to
achieve this goal.\nPhase I Activities and Expected Deliverables:\nPhase
 I must demonstrate the feasibility of an advanced methodology pipeline
for rapid and high-quality de novo genome assembly of several arthropod
genomes. Specifically, at least three tick vector genomes of public
health importance (e. g., Ixodes scapularis, Dermacentor variabilis,
Amblyomma americanum) with different genomic characteristics (total
estimated genome sizes of &amp;gt;1 Gbp and different amounts of
repetitive DNA families) must be assembled to reasonable contiguity (N50
 &amp;gt; 200 Kbp) and quality by the responder to the solicitation. For
 Phase I, only the final data demonstrating successful de novo assembly
of these targets will need be provided. Additional high quality
conventional annotation and chromosome mapping confirmation that these
assemblies are indeed correct will be required in Phase II for each of
these three targets as well as the additional genomes to be analyzed in
Phase II.\nProjected Phase II activities\nPhase II projects must
demonstrate the scalability and cost-effectiveness of the technology
approach demonstrated in Phase I, as well as quality annotations for the
 assemblies. For each respective year of the phase II project period, a
total of 8 (including the three Phase I targets) (Phase II-yr1) and 10
(Phase II-yr2) additional arthropod vector genome assemblies and
annotations, including other arthropod species of public health interest
 in at least four arthropod orders (e. g., fleas, ticks, lice, mites,
triatomines) with genomes &amp;gt; 500 Mbp, must be produced that meet
the same annotation quality, N50 and contiguity criteria established for
 the three Phase I assemblies. Furthermore, each assembly in the second
phase must be completed, or a credible roadmap demonstrated to reach, a
total reagent cost reduced to less than $10,000 per assembly for those
performed in the last year of Phase II. Generated assemblies must be
released to the public domain, and applicant must perform and
demonstrate gene annotation and synteny comparisons of qualities
comparable to the state of the art generally achieved for well-assembled
 reference vertebrate genomes.\nImpact\nHigher-quality arthropod genome
assemblies will support public health research and interventions on a
number of fronts. Better assemblies and broader sampling are highly
conducive to comparative analyses for understanding phylogenetic
relationships between closely and distantly related disease vectors.
Population genetic analyses will become more powerful by allowing for
more accurate characterization of population growth or decline, changes
in geographic distribution through time, and evolutionary forces such as
 selection and drift. Higher-quality assemblies also allow better genome
 annotation via both syntenic and computational analyses, which in turn
offer insight into host\/symbiont relationships and the genetic basis of
 disease transmission. All of these benefits positively impact the
ability to understand arthropod-borne disease transmission and,
consequently, capabilities for effective prevention and
intervention.&amp;nbsp; Arthropods are increasingly resistant to
pesticides used in their control.&amp;nbsp; A fundamental understanding
of the genetics of vectors is essential to developing new strategies for
 reducing the huge economic and public health burdens they
cause.&amp;nbsp; The first step in this process is to obtain high
quality reference genome sequences which can provide the basis for
development of other novel methodologies applicable to related species
and diverging populations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The methods demonstrated
should be applicable to a much wider selection of species of interest,
both vertebrate and for other invertebrate groups, and provide a
commercially viable future for a successful responder to this
solicitation.\nCommercialization Potential\n&amp;nbsp;\nMore than 5000
arthropod genomes have been proposed for sequencing (i5K project) and
numerous pests of agricultural importance as well medically important
vectors are on this list.&amp;nbsp; Insects alone comprise the largest
number of species of any life form except bacteria and arthropods are
the most successful animals on the planet. Given the importance of
arthropods in disease transmission, the vast diversity of the phylum,
and the importance of high quality genome assemblies for effective
scientific investigations, the proposed technologies embody substantial
market potential. Whereas the i5K project is estimated to take 5 or 10
years to complete, our goal is to use advanced technologies to obtain
results sooner than this and of better quality. The ultimate service or
product provided will find extensive use with all eukaryotic subjects of
 genomics research. Thorough characterization of the many important
arthropod genomes will be a long term effort by the scientific community
 providing an ongoing need for the proposed product from the
solicitation responder for many years to come.",

        "topic_name": "Detecting Lower Intestinal Microbiome Disruption
and Multidrug Resistant Organisms",
        "description": "Background\nAntibiotic resistance causes over 2
million infections and 23,000 deaths annually in the United States alone
 and is a global public health challenge that has reached critical
levels in healthcare settings, and the evolution of multidrug-resistant
organisms (MDROs) threaten to move the care of hospitalized patients
into a pre-antibiotic era. These MDROs include organisms such as
vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), extended-spectrum beta-lactam resistant
Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLs), and Clostridium difficile, all of which
primarily colonize patients in the lower intestine where they undergo
clonal expansion and often dominate the microbiome.&amp;nbsp;
Prerequisite for colonization by these intestinal MDROs are disruption
and shift in diversity of the lower intestinal microbiome that usually
result from exposure to antibiotics, but may be contributed to by other
medications, dietary changes, and diarrhea from viral and non-infectious
 causes.&amp;nbsp; Following colonization, dominance of the lower
intestinal microbiome by a particular MDRO (as defined by constituting
&amp;gt;30% of the microbiome) is a risk factor for infection. Moreover,
 intestinal MDRO dominance, over and above low-level colonization, is
associated with increased skin and environmental contamination, and risk
 of transmission.\nInvestigations are underway to identify critical
taxonomic and functional components of the intestinal microbiome that,
when absent, confer risk for colonization or infection with MDROs.
Meanwhile, current infection control and public health recommendations
often include active surveillance testing to detect and contain
transmission from patients who are asymptomatically colonized with the
aforementioned MDROs.\nProject Goals\nDevelop a proof of concept assay
that could be used as the basis of a diagnostic method for stool that
quantitatively detects not only the presence and relative amount of one
or more of the previously described MDROs (i.e., CRE, VRE, ESBL, and\/or
 C. difficile), but also the taxonomic components and diversity of the
gut microbiome.&amp;nbsp; The approach to both MDRO detection and
microbiome description may utilize a number of different existing
technologic platforms and combinations thereof including, but not
limited to, single or multiplex PCR platforms, 16S ribosomal
RNA-encoding DNA amplification and sequencing, deep DNA sequencing, or
other advanced metagenomic or metabolomic methods.\nThe overall
objectives are to: 1) detect colonization&amp;nbsp; by one or more
MDRO(s) using a molecular approach expected to yield a clinically
meaningful sensitivity and specificity; 2) determine the abundance of
the MDRO(s) relative to important taxonomic components of the lower
intestinal microbiome (e.g., degree of dominance); 3) determine relative
 abundance and diversity of the important taxa of the lower intestinal
microbiome to describe disruptions that may portend future near-term
risk of MDRO colonization or, if already colonized, the future risk for
transmission and infection and; 4) generate results with a clinically
useful turnaround time.\nPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables\n1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Determine a workable strategy to achieve the above outlined
goals.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Develop pertinent wet-lab protocols to identify and modify, if
necessary, any existing software or bioinformatics tools necessary for
interpretation,
and&amp;nbsp;\n3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Demonstrate, using spiked human stool or waste clinical specimens from
which MDRO have been cultured, the detection of MDROs and, using stool
from antibiotic-na\u00efve and antibiotic-experienced patients, the
ability to discern major microbiome disruptions.\nProjected Phase II
Activities\n1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Build-out of modular components for commercialization of a clinical
assay including adaptation of assay and results interpretation for use
with rectal swabs\n2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Perform a clinical demonstration study divided into two
phases:\na.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Testing
at-risk patients periodically throughout their hospitalization,
correlating results of the combined microbiome and MDRO assay performed
on a rectal swab with antibiotic and other drug exposures as well as
microbiologic evidence (i.e., perform sampling) of patient skin, patient
 care area environment (i.e., high-touch surfaces), and healthcare
worker hand contamination caused by the target MDRO. Select patient
population (based on underlying clinical risk) and power the sample size
 to examine the capability of assay to predict ongoing risk for
colonization (in the previously non-colonized) and transmission or
infection events among those already colonized. No clinical or infection
 control intervention will be based upon assay results, observational
only. The goal will be to demonstrate the predictive capability of the
combined assay results of microbiome disruption and MDRO detection (and
the degree of MDRO dominance in the microbiome), over and above
qualitative MDRO detection alone, for the likelihood of colonization or,
 if already colonized, the likelihood to serve as a source for
transmission.\nb.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A
proof of concept infection control intervention focused on enhanced
environmental cleaning and glove use triggered by assay results,
examining its impact on transmission and compared to either a historic
(i.e., quasi-experimental) or concurrent ward, unit, or facility
control.\n3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Engage
either developers of an advanced probiotic or academic investigators
studying fecal microbiota transplantation (under an FDA IND) to design
study for future implementation in which one of these interventions is
offered to patients on the basis of assay results as a means to reduce
their risk for colonization and infection as well as transmission to
other patients.\nImpact\nHaving a means to monitor the level of
microbiome disruption in a patient, while simultaneously detecting
colonization with selected MDROs, will allow proactive identification of
 the infection control risk of patients, both in terms of their
vulnerability to colonization with an MDRO (i.e., if they are disrupted)
 and their risk of transmission if they are already MDRO-colonized or
(especially) if they are MDRO-dominated. Moreover, because MDROs are
pathobionts, it is likely the identification of MDRO domination will
become regarded as an important independent risk factor (along with
others) for infection in many, if not all, patient populations.
Meanwhile, microbiome restorative therapies are currently under clinical
 development. The data generated from assays such as this, once
integrated into clinical care, will provide not only direction to
antibiotic stewardship and infection control but also form the basis for
 an entirely new frontier of patient management. It is not an over
statement that the development and use of \u2018microbiome disruption
indexes\u2019 in patient management will revolutionize current infection
 control and MDRO prevention in all of healthcare.\nCommercialization
Potential\nWith the appropriate level of intellectual and fiscal capital
 invested into a relatively easy to use, straightforward platform with
good bioinformatics support, the commercialization potential is
tremendous. At least in the case of C. difficile there are already
national third-party payer incentives for hospitals to reduce publically
 reported rates, such that it is plausible that hospitals will utilize
available advanced diagnostics that stratify patient risks for
colonization, transmission, and infection. In addition, it is likely
that advanced probiotics and other microbiome restorative therapies will
 become available in the next 5-10 years and, coupled with the
appropriate risk-stratifying diagnostics, these may become administered
routinely to patients with microbiome disruption following antibiotic or
 other drug therapies.\nNational Center For HIV\/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis,

        "topic_name": "Serologic measurement of hepatitis B virus
cccDNA",
        "description": "Background\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is
 a global public health concern. Worldwide more than 350 million people
are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus. HBV infection causes
acute and chronic hepatitis leading to liver cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma. After HBV infection, viral DNA is transferred
to nuclei of the infected hepatocytes and the double-stranded, open
circular DNA is converted to covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA).
Persistence of cccDNA remains an obstacle to clearing HBV in chronically
 infected people, who remain at risk of developing advanced liver
disease. This is because cccDNA acts as a template for continued virion
production in the hepatocyte nucleoplasm. As long as the infected
hepatocyte survives, cccDNA remains in the nucleus, maintaining a viral
\u2032pool\u2032. Further, in patients undergoing antiviral therapy who
discontinue treatment, HBV can reactivate from cccDNA.&amp;nbsp; To
monitor the persistence of cccDNA in the liver, repeated liver biopsies
are required, which are hazardous and uncomfortable to the patient, and
costly.\nPrevious studies have shown the presence of cccDNA in serum of
chronically infected patients. Serum cccDNA levels correlate well with
intrahepatic cccDNA content. Serum cccDNA may thus be used for
sequential monitoring of intrahepatic cccDNA levels without the
requirement for repeated liver biopsies. Further, the appearance of
cccDNA in the serum can be a marker of liver damage.\nQuantitative
detection of cccDNA in serum thus has potential to evaluate the severity
 of liver damage and the efficacy of antiviral therapy. Methodologies
for the detection of HBV cccDNA in serum have been reported but assays
for its detection and quantification are not commercially available.
Development of a facile quantitative assay is required for quantitative
detection of cccDNA in peripheral blood, whose manufacture can be scaled
 up and marketed to diagnostic laboratories.\nProject Goal\nThe purpose
of this project is to identify a panel of sera from treated and
untreated HBV-infected patients, validate and develop an assay for
quantitative detection of cccDNA in serum or plasma, establish the
performance characteristics of assay, and establish and validate the
cccDNA detection kit.\nPhase I Activities and
Deliverables\n1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Design assay for quantitative detection of HBV cccDNA in serum or plasma
 from HBV-infected
patients.\n2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Validate
 assay and determine sensitivity and specificity using seroconversion
panels.\nProjected Phase II
Activities:\n1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Validation of the assay using specimens from HBV-infected patients and
controls; optimize and validate the assay using clinical samples from
patients and controls and establish and improve performance
characteristics of
assay.\n2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Validation
of the assay using specimen from HBV infected patients and Report
Writing; produce prototype HBV cccDNA assay and explore feasibility of
transferring technology to commercial and state and public health
laboratories.\nImpact\nAfter infection or antiviral therapy, HBV remains
 dormant in the infected person by adopting the cccDNA form in the
liver. As cccDNA can also be found in the blood, especially after liver
damage, its detection in serum or plasma allows the efficacy of
antiviral therapy and the extent of liver damage to be evaluated without
 resorting to liver biopsies. Worldwide more than 350 million people are
 chronically infected with HBV. Improved antivirals are in the pipeline
that potentially cure instead of suppress HBV. In the next 5-10 years, a
 substantial proportion of HBV infected persons who undergo antiviral
therapy will benefit from access to a facile diagnostic method for the
detection of cccDNA.\nCommercialization Potential\n&amp;nbsp;\nAssays
for detection and quantification of cccDNA in serum are not available. A
 simple, cost-effective and sensitive test kit, whose manufacture is
then scaled up, should become marketable for use in diagnostic
laboratories.&amp;nbsp;",

        "topic_name": "Serologic detection and quantification of
hepatitis B core antigen ",
        "description": "Background\nHepatitis B is a major public health
 problem in United States, where 1.4 million persons are estimated to be
 infected with the virus. HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) is the mainstay
serological marker used for identifying HBV infection and evaluating the
 efficacy of antiviral therapy. However, it is not a reliable marker of
HBV found in blood, as it is shed from the liver in much greater
abundance than HBV virions. Further, HBsAg can be shed from HBV even
when it is residing in the liver in the latent (non-replicating)
state.\nHBV core antigen (HBcAg) is a constituent of the HBV
nucleocapsid, which after encapsidation is released into the
circulation.&amp;nbsp; HBcAg in serum or plasma is a better indicator
than HBsAg of the extent of shedding of HBV virions from the liver to
peripheral blood, i.e., \u2018productive\u2019 HBV infection.&amp;nbsp;
Critically, as transcription and translation of HBcAg production are not
 inhibited by nucleotide analogues currently used for antiviral therapy,
 patients treated with these drugs continue to produce HBcAg for
considerable periods of time. Immunoassays to detect HBcAg can therefore
 help in identifying HBV infections without resorting to HBsAg or HBV
DNA testing.\n&amp;nbsp;\nPrevious studies have shown that HBc
antigenimia correlates positively with HBcAg production in the
liver.&amp;nbsp; Several methodologies for the detection of HBcAg core
antigen in serum have been published but assays for its detection and
quantification are not commercially available for use in diagnostic
procedures. Development of a reliable immunoassay that can also be an
alternative to HBsAg and HBV DNA testing, is needed.\nProject

Design and develop a simple immunoassay for detection and quantification
 of HBcAg in human serum or plasma from persons with acute and chronic
HBV infection\nActivity: Identify a panel of antibodies with the
potential to be capture agents for HBcAg in serum or plasma.\nProjected

Establish sensitivity and specificity of the assay, continue to refine
the assay and improve performance characteristics of the

core antigen is increasingly being used to identify persistent HCV
infection and evaluating the efficacy of anti-HCV therapy. Similarly,
testing for HBcAg has potential for use to identify productive HBV
infection and evaluating the efficacy of anti-HBV therapy. Worldwide
more than 350 million people are chronically infected with HBV. Improved
 antivirals are in the pipeline that potentially cure instead of
suppress HBV. In the next 5-10 years, a substantial proportion of
HBV-infected persons can then benefit from access to testing for HBVcAg.
 This start- up initiative, when funded and successfully developed,
should lead to a marketable product for use in commercial and publically

        "topic_name": "Transcutaneous immunization against rotavirus
using a dissolvable microneedle patch ",
        "description": "Background\nCurrently licensed live oral
rotavirus vaccines, RotaTeq and Rotarix, are effective in preventing
severe diarrhea among children in developed and middle income countries,
 but are significantly less effective in the developing world. While the
 causal mechanisms for this lower efficacy have not been clearly
defined, we hypothesize that multiple factors, such as high titers of
pre-existing maternal antibody, breast feeding and interference by other
 flora and viruses in the gut, might play a role in reduced vaccine
efficiency among children.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, rotavirus remains a
major killer among children in low-income countries of Africa and Asia.
In addition, both vaccines are associated with a low risk of diarrhea
and intussusception (i.e., blockage of the small intestine) among
infants who receive the first dose of vaccine. To improve the safety and
 efficacy of oral rotavirus vaccines, CDC scientists have developed a
proprietary inactivated rotavirus vaccine (IRV) technology (new human
strains and a novel method for rotavirus inactivation) and demonstrated
the immunogenicity and protective efficacy in piglets of this IRV by
intramuscular (IM) injection and transcutaneous administration using
microneedles. With the establishment of proof of concept for parenteral
(i.e., non-oral) immunization, CDC has licensed this technology to a
number of vaccine manufacturers for further R&amp;amp;D and clinical
development of an IM IRV.\nWe now propose a SBIR topic for the
formulation and fabrication of a dissolving microneedle patch to deliver
 an IRV for transcutaneous immunization against rotavirus in
collaboration with a contract manufacturing organization. We have
recently demonstrated enhanced immunogenicity of our IRV using an
innovative metal microneedle patch technology, achieving comparable
antibody titers with a 1\/10th of the antigen dose compared to those
induced by a full IM dose of vaccine. Microneedles provide a simple and
painless method to administer vaccines without using hypodermic needles.
 They are inexpensive to manufacture and may not need the cold chain
with large volume of cold storage and high cost, a major advantage for
immunization campaigns in the developing world.\nTranscutaneous
immunization using a dissolvable microneedle patch is a novel and
innovative approach to the prevention against infectious diseases, but
no such vaccines have been licensed for use in humans yet. Currently
this technology to deliver influenza vaccine is being tested and
evaluated in phase I clinical trials. Similar clinical trials for
inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) using a dissolvable microneedle patch
are being planned for the next few years. However, no development and
proof of concept work have been done for IRV.\nProject Goal\nThe goal of
 this project is to conduct formulation and process development and a
feasibility study to manufacture a dissolving microneedle patch for skin
 immunization against rotavirus. This program area will provide small
business companies with opportunities to apply for necessary funds and
work with CDC scientists to further optimize the fabrication process and
 prepare a dissolving microneedle patch for clinical trials of a patch
IRV.\nPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables&amp;nbsp;\n1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

 a phase I clinical trial to assess the safety, immunogenicity,
reactogenicity, and acceptability of IRV vaccination using a microneedle
 patch.\nImpact\nThe findings from this SBIR research may allow us to
enhance public health through the development of a low cost vaccine with
 an improved safety and efficacy profile and thus help advance
CDC\u2019s Global Immunization Winnable Battle that includes increasing
Global Health Impact of rotavirus vaccination.\nCommercialization
Potential\n&amp;nbsp;\nDemonstration of the feasibility for the
manufacture of a dissolving microneedle patch for IRV will bode well for
 a serious investment and more expeditious and effective development of
this new and innovative IRV for commercialization. This IRV would be
more efficacious in resource-poor settings because of its parenteral
administration. As the world is transitioning to IPV from oral polio
vaccine (OPV), a combined IPV and IRV in the expanded program on
immunization (EPI) would ultimately increase global health impact
through large immunization campaigns and help save more lives.",

        "topic_name": "Thermostable Dry Powder Live Attenuated Influenza
 Vaccine for Nasal Delivery",
        "description": "Background\nOngoing disease and death associated
 with seasonal influenza and the threat of an influenza pandemic are two
 of the highest priority issues for global public health. Vaccination is
 a powerful tool for preventing influenza, however, current vaccines
have several limitations. Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) given by
needle injection require skilled health care workers and can lead to
needle-associated injuries and infections. Liquid nasal live attenuated
influenza vaccine (LAIV) is needle-free but has limitations which can
result in restricted distribution of vaccine.&amp;nbsp; The limitations
of IIV and LAIV are critical because unlike many other vaccines, almost
everyone needs flu vaccine every year. Also, efficient rapid
distribution is essential especially in a pandemic situation. An ideally
 distributable vaccine could be shipped without restriction, by mail for
 example, and self-administered.&amp;nbsp; Every step away from this
ideal decreases the accessibility of the vaccine. Both IIV and liquid
LAIV require strict adherence to cold chain requirements (shipping and
storage at 2-8\u2070C) which restricts distribution to facilities with
monitored refrigeration.&amp;nbsp; This is expensive in the developed
world and can significantly restrict distribution in the developed
world, where cold chain capacity is stretched by routine EPI vaccination
 requirements and has little or no surge capacity for influenza vaccines
 or pandemic situations.\nWhile the needle-free nasal administration
LAIV is an advantage over vaccination by injection the liquid delivery
format has several limitations. The FluMist\u2122 LAIV available in the
US is shipped and delivered in a prefilled liquid in a glass syringe
which imposes shipping requirements and increases shipping costs. More
importantly vaccine by liquid nasal spray results in suboptimal vaccine
deposition. The large droplets administered by liquid nasal spray
devices accumulate in the nares and much the dose is wasted by dripping
out of the nose does not reach the target nasopharyngeal
tissues.&amp;nbsp; Also, liquid nasal sprays require an experienced
vaccinator as differences in the force and speed of plunger depression
results in variable droplet size and the placement of the spray tip can
significantly affect vaccine deposition.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
LAIV based on the Leningrad donor virus is also delivered as a liquid
nasal spray. This vaccine is shipped as a lyophilized cake and requires
reconstitution with a separate liquid diluent, which adds another layer
of complexity to vaccine delivery. These two limitations in the
distributability of liquid LAIV, cold chain requirements and inefficient
 liquid delivery are the gaps this project seeks to address.\nRecent
studies in anatomic models of nasal airways have shown dry powder nasal
delivery provides markedly improved distribution and retention compared
to liquid nasal spray delivery. Dry powder nasal delivery was also less
sensitive to vaccinator variability and can potentially be
self-administered. (CDC unpublished data) A nasal thermostable dry
powder LAIV would retain the advantages of needle-free nasal delivery
and improve upon them by removing cold chain restrictions and improving
the consistency and efficiency of delivery and reducing the skill level
needed to deliver nasal LAIV.&amp;nbsp;\nProject Goal\nThe goal of the
proposed research is to develop a thermostable dry powder LAIV for nasal
 delivery as a platform technology and assess immunogenicity following
nasal powder vaccination in a ferret model. It is expected that this
platform technology of thermostable dry powder nasal vaccine will be
expanded to use for other vaccines.\nPhase I Activities and Expected

 with homologous influenza virus and measure viral
load\n&amp;nbsp;\nImpact\nThe increased distributability of thermostable
 dry powder nasal LAIV could significantly improve coverage in the
developed and developing world. In addition to the reduction in
influenza morbidity and mortality, it is intended that this platform
technology be expanded to other vaccines, increasing their accessibility
 and decreasing the morbidity and mortality of the respective
diseases.&amp;nbsp; New thermostable vaccines could be stored and
delivered at ambient temperatures, without refrigeration, deceasing
energy usage and equipment costs for refrigeration and lightening loads
for vaccine transport and delivery. This would be especially helpful in
the developing world where hauling icepacks and coolers can make an
already rough journey to a village more difficult. Thermostable vaccines
 can also eliminate the potentially catastrophic loss of vaccine potency
 that results when cold-chain methods fail, and facilitate distribution
in pandemic responses, mass-vaccination campaigns, and agricultural
applications. The disadvantages of liquid vaccine delivery format-
increased shipping requirements and costs, suboptimal vaccine
deposition, need for experienced vaccinators and onsite reconstitution
are described above. A thermostable powder vaccine could be potentially
be shipped by mail or hand carried by anyone and self-administered or
administered by people with minimal skill level.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
This is the ideal in making vaccines accessible to everyone who needs
them.\nCommercialization Potential\nThe Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends every person over age 6 months
receive annual flu vaccination, with few exceptions, which would require
 over 300 million doses a year. In recent seasons over 130 million doses
 of flu vaccine were distributed annually in the US, almost equaling the
 total of all other vaccines combined. Over the recent years, the global
 influenza vaccine market has witnessed double digit growth rate due to
fear of an impending pandemic and is expected to cross USD 4 billion in
2015.&amp;nbsp; The high volume demand for influenza vaccine fosters
competition which is leading to increased innovation in vaccine
delivery. Vaccine manufacturers are willing to invest in improved
delivery systems to increase market share by making their vaccines more
acceptable and accessible to the population.&amp;nbsp; Recent licensed
innovations influenza vaccine include needle-free nasal spray LAIV
(MedImmune FluMist\u2122 AccuSpray syringe), intradermal delivery using
minineedles (Sanofi Fluzone ID\u2122 with Soluvia\u2122 minineedles),
and vaccination by jet injection (bio CSL\u2019s Afluria\u2122 with
PharmaJet Stratis\u2122 jet injector.&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe most
likely business model for the small business developer of a formulation
and process for thermostable dry powder LAIV would be to license the
technology to vaccine manufacturers for fees and or royalties.",

        "description": "\n\tPurpose\/Research Objectives\n\n\tThe
purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to support
research using advanced technologies (e.g., bio-chips, microfluidics,
and mobile technologies) to develop novel point-of-care (POC) devices
and implement existing technologies in clinical settings with a goal to
guide diagnostic and therapeutic efforts for the heart, lung, blood and
sleep disorders.&amp;nbsp; Applicants are encouraged to form a
multidisciplinary team\/network (i.e., from technical to clinical
expertise) to develop devices that will significantly empower patients,
physicians, and clinical researchers to better manage or treat HLB and
sleep disorders. &amp;nbsp;\n\n\tApplicants should describe technical
approaches, methodologies, and plan to develop and implement their POC
devices that will significantly improve disease management and\/or
treatment.&amp;nbsp; Applications should have all relevant details
including quality control and assurance, standards for samples,
handling, and testing.&amp;nbsp; Related previous experience and
qualifications of the team members should be well described.&amp;nbsp;
Once the POC tool\/technology\/test has been developed and validated,
applicants will be expected to test the feasibility of the product in
ongoing (or otherwise) heart, lung, blood and sleep clinical
studies.&amp;nbsp; Applications may also need to describe how to
interpret the testing results as well as relevant bioinformatics and\/or
 wireless technological component to link the POC test data with other
relevant patient data (e.g., data in Electronic Health Records). This
will enable the rapid sharing and synchronization of data for treatment
at the POC.&amp;nbsp; It is expected that commercial products or tools
will be developed for use in the clinical setting at the POC as a result
 of this program.&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\tPOC technologies are becoming
increasingly valuable tools in improving or enhancing the diagnosis of
several conditions including congestive heart failure, acute coronary
syndrome, coagulopathy and asthma.&amp;nbsp; Major benefits such as
faster time to intervention have been demonstrated when the results of
POC testing are utilized in conjunction with Electronic Health Records
or mobile technology, and when combined with goal directed
therapy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Utilization of POC technology allows
for:\n\n\t\n\t\tGreater accessibility to novel technologies for disease
diagnosis.\n\t\n\t\tReal-time detection of clinical laboratory
measures\/biomarkers.\n\t\n\t\tStandardization of phenotype
measurements.\n\t\n\t\tRapid, standardized, and cost-effective
diagnosis.\n\t\n\t\tImproved assay\/test throughput, decreased assay
turn-around times.\n\t\n\t\tDecreased delays in initiation of
therapy.\n\t\n\t\tEnhanced communication of test results with multiple
parties.\n\n\n\tBased on the benefits listed above, these technologies
have the potential to play a pivotal role in personalizing medicine,
improving healthcare delivery, and, ultimately, reducing healthcare
costs.&amp;nbsp; While many of these tools are being developed for
clinical application, it is also possible that some of the existing
technology could enhance the research enterprise by being used
&amp;ldquo;onsite&amp;rdquo; for clinical research and trials.
Additional benefits of POC-related tools and technologies in clinical
research include: easier recruitment, baseline, and follow-up
measurements, expedited patient ascertainment and analysis, more rapid
dispensation of interventions, better quality control and monitoring of
study compliance.&amp;nbsp; Utilization of POC technology could also
allow for research participants to be enrolled in less sophisticated
research environments and remote, low-resource
locations.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tSpecific Areas of Research
Interest:\n\n\tProjects that address a specific and well-characterized
clinical need will be considered of high potential impact.&amp;nbsp; The
 technologies developed with funding through this FOA are expected to be
 integrated systems or, if they are novel components, be easily
integrated into existing systems.&amp;nbsp; Proposed tools or
technologies should interoperate and communicate with existing health
information technology systems as appropriate.&amp;nbsp; Some other
technical features that are expected are the following: reliability,
robustness, safety, simplicity, reliance on the appropriate baseline
information, contextual awareness, inclusion of software to support
decision-making, and consideration of power consumption.&amp;nbsp;
Ideally, systems will integrate information from multiple sensors,
appropriate clinical information, and ambient data such as temperature
or global position.&amp;nbsp; Proposed tools and technologies should
incorporate existing standards and consider regulatory requirements
where appropriate.&amp;nbsp; In addition, global health concerns,
improved access to underserved areas, and cost-effectiveness should be
highlighted.\n\n\tResearch examples include, but are not limited
to:\n\n\t\n\t\tA nano-sensor or bio-chip device to determine nutritional
 indices from blood and urine samples at the POC.\n\t\n\t\tPOC device to
 monitor complicated and vulnerable patients after heart or lung
transplant.\n\t\n\t\tA portable bio-chip device for DNA extraction and
high-throughput genomic analyses, for genotype-guided clinical heart,
lung or blood treatment studies.\n\t\n\t\tPOC ultrasound device to
detect aortic aneurysms.\n\t\n\t\tImproved microfluidics assays and POC
EKGs to detect myocardial infarction.\n\t\n\t\tImplementation of simple,
 robust, and cost effective methods to measure and transmit blood
pressure and\/or cardiovascular function information from remote
locations, e.g., test reliability\/clinical utility of an existing blood
 pressure measuring smart phone application.\n\t\n\t\tPOC instruments to
 detect stage of bleeding in trauma patients; determine responsiveness
to antiplatelet therapies; assess need for platelet or plasma
transfusion.\n\t\n\t\tEvaluation of sensor devices capable of detecting
hemoglobin levels to inform therapeutic decisions in clinical trials
evaluating populations suffering acute blood loss or hemolysis (trauma,
postpartum hemorrhage, anemias of any type).\n\t\n\t\tPOC devices to
measure and transmit information about the quality of
patients&amp;rsquo; environment, e.g., air
quality\/pollution.\n\t\n\t\tMobile apps to alert and monitor asthma
treatment that can be used by both patients and
doctors.\n\t\n\t\tPortable and cost-effective POC device(s) to
alert\/monitor sleepiness of drivers while driving and\/or the sleep
quality during night; assess samples for biomarkers that will facilitate
 the characterization of an individual&amp;rsquo;s chronotype,
variations in chronotype, and the effect of medical interventions on
circadian rhythm.\n\t\n\t\tAffordable in home monitoring devices to
assess trans-dermal oxygen saturation via mobile apps that could also
capture heart rate, respiratory rate, and
temperature.\n\t\n\t\tInexpensive implantable (injectable) nanochips for
 POC or in home monitoring of drug levels e.g. antibiotics, TB drugs,
anti-retroviral drugs, Coumadin, corticosteroids.\n\t\n\t\tPortable,
manually powered nebulizer device that is cost effective and easy to use
 by patients.\n\t\n\t\tBreath Test device to monitor or diagnose heart,
lung, or blood disorders.\n\t\n\t\tNovel sputum test device to monitor
or diagnose lung diseases.\n\n\n\tApplicants are encouraged to
collaborate with federally funded programs such as the NCATS Clinical
and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs), the NIBIB Point-of-Care
Technologies Network (POCTRN), the NICHD Medical Rehabilitation Research
 Infrastructure Network, the NIH Basic and Behavioral &amp;amp; Social

        "description": "\n\tPurpose\n\n\tThe purpose of this funding
opportunity is to reduce health disparities through the development and
translation of appropriate medical technologies. The NIH defines health
disparities as differences in the incidence, prevalence, morbidity,
mortality, and burden of diseases and other adverse health outcomes that
 exist among specific population groups. These population groups include
 racial and ethnic minorities (African Americans, American Indians,
Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians,
and other U.S. Pacific Islanders, subpopulations of all of these
racial\/ethnic groups), socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, and
 medically underserved populations including individuals residing in
rural and urban areas. Appropriate medical technologies must have the
following basic characteristics: effective, affordable, culturally
acceptable, and easily accessible to those who need them. Responsive
grant applications must involve a formal collaboration with a healthcare
 provider or other healthcare organization serving one or more health
disparity populations during Phase I and Phase II. This announcement
supports applications to develop medical devices, imaging systems, and
other technologies that adequately address the healthcare needs of
health disparity populations. It is expected that responsive grant
applications will result in advances in medical technologies that will
be invaluable in reducing health disparities within and across the
priority areas of cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes,
HIV\/AIDS, infant mortality, mental health, and obesity, as well as
lung, liver, and kidney diseases, psoriasis, scleroderma, and other
diseases, illnesses, and conditions of public health
importance.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tMedical and scientific advances have
introduced new opportunities for the continued improvement of health for
 all Americans. However, in spite of notable improvements gained as a
result of the technological advancement, there continues to be an
alarming disproportionate burden of illness among minority and other
health disparity populations. Overcoming persistent disparities in
healthcare access and health outcomes remains a foremost challenge. To
meet this challenge, the NIH is committed to supporting a wide range of
research, aimed at the development of innovative diagnostics,
treatments, and preventative strategies to reduce, and eventually
eliminate, health disparities.\n\n\tResearch Objectives and
Scope\n\n\tThe primary objective of this funding opportunity is to
support the translation of medical technologies, new or existing, that
can have a significant impact on healthcare access and health outcomes
for health disparity populations. Small business concerns (SBCs) are
invited to submit grant applications proposing to develop and deliver
appropriate technologies to health disparity populations. Responsive
grant applications must involve a formal collaboration with a healthcare
 provider or other healthcare organization serving one or more health
disparity populations during Phase I and Phase II. A requisite element
of the research plan is a description of the healthcare requirements and
 needs of the population and the existing barriers to adequate
healthcare delivery. Several of these barriers have been identified and
are described below. Applications submitted to this funding opportunity
must address one or more of these barriers in developing technologies
that will impact health disparities:\n\n\t\n\t\tPhysical
Barriers&amp;mdash;factors such as proximity to healthcare facilities
and transportation may limit access to healthcare\n\n\n\t\n\t\tKnowledge
 Barriers&amp;mdash;health literacy and language barriers can inhibit
healthcare delivery, as well as a lack of patient information for the
healthcare provider\n\n\n\t\n\t\tInfrastructure Barriers&amp;mdash;rural
 hospitals and community health centers may not have the same resources
and expertise of large hospitals, and may not be able to afford advanced
 medical technologies\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEconomic Barriers&amp;mdash;lack of
insurance coverage or financial resources may also contribute to
disparities in healthcare access\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCultural
Barriers&amp;mdash;religious beliefs and social customs often deter
certain populations from seeking healthcare\n\n\n\tAppropriate
technologies may be new and innovative, or they may be existing
technologies that have been redesigned based on the needs of a specific
health disparity population. Appropriate technologies have been defined
as effective, affordable, culturally acceptable, and deliverable to
those who need them. To be effective, a technology must provide an
improvement over the current quality of care for a health disparity
population by overcoming one or more of the barriers. The technology
must also be low-cost, so as to be affordable to the local hospital,
community health center, primary care physician, or individual patient
in need. For a medical technology to be adopted by a health disparity
population, the technology development must be amenable to the
population&amp;rsquo;s cultural beliefs and social customs. Acceptance
of the technology by the population is critical to the successful
delivery of quality healthcare. To be physically delivered to those in
need, a technology must be developed within the specifications of the
operating environment of the end-user. The technology must be able to
function given the existing resources and expertise within health
disparity populations. Keeping in mind the barriers that contribute to
health disparities, a non-inclusive list of appropriate medical
technologies that might achieve the objectives of this initiative may be
 found below:\n\n\t\n\t\tTelehealth technologies for remote diagnosis
and monitoring\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSensors for point-of-care
diagnosis\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDevices for in-home
monitoring\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMobile, portable diagnostic and therapeutic
systems\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDevices which integrate diagnosis and
treatment\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDiagnostics or treatments that do not require
special training\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDevices that can operate in low-resource
environments\n\n\n\t\n\t\tNon-invasive technologies for diagnosis and
treatment\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIntegrated, automated system to assess or monitor
 a specific condition\n\n\n\tSome examples include, but are not limited
to:\n\n\t\n\t\tInexpensive diabetic test strip and\/or blood sugar
monitoring.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tUse of currently available basic technology
(e.g. phone lines, televisions with remote controls, cellphones, weight
scales, diabetic glucometers, thermometers) within underserved settings
to promote self-management and patient education, increase
patient-clinician communication and surveillance of chronic disease
conditions.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTelemedicine to improve access to specialty
care which would normally not be accessible because of high cost and
transportation.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tImproved early detection (via saliva
testing, breath testing, blood testing) of diseases where there are
significant health disparities.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLow-cost portable imaging

Systems (GENSETS)",
        "description": "PLEASE NOTE: A prior Letter of Intent is not
required for this specific FOA from DOE-ARPA-E.\nSUMMARY\nThe GENSETS
Program \u2013 GENerators for Small Electrical and Thermal Systems
\u2013 seeks to fund the development of potentially disruptive generator
 technologies that will enable widespread deployment of residential
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems. Here, CHP is defined as the
distributed generation of electricity from piped-in natural gas fuel at a
 residence or a commercial site complemented by use of exhaust heat for
local heating and cooling. If adopted widely by U.S. residential and
commercial sectors, GENSETS CHP systems could lead to annual primary
energy savings of more than 5 quadrillion BTU (quads). GENSETS systems
could also provide annual CO2 emissions reductions of more than 200
million metric tons, which is roughly 10% of the CO2 produced annually
from U.S. electricity generation and 4% of total U.S. annual CO2
emissions.\nThe GENSETS Program seeks transformative generators\/engines
 with 1 kW of electrical output (kWe) that have high efficiency (40%
fuel to electricity), long life (10 years), low cost ($3,000 per
system), and low emissions. Heat engines and generators capable of
achieving these targets may include internal and external combustion
engines, turbines, and solid state devices such as thermophotovoltaics,
thermionic emitters, and thermoelectrics. It is anticipated that the
same technologies developed for 1-kWe engines in GENSETS could be
adapted to build larger engines with even higher efficiencies for
various commercial sectors of the U.S.\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\nPROGRAM
OBJECTIVES\nAll the current state-of-the-art engines for CHP suffer from
 low efficiency and high cost. The ARPA-E GENSETS program is seeking
fundamentally disruptive technologies that can markedly improve the fuel
 to electricity efficiency to 40% while delivering 1 kWe electrical
power at low cost. The total system cost should not exceed $3,000 at
high volume (e.g., 1 million unit scale) (excluding $1,400 installation
and balance of plant costs). These technologies must meet the emissions
requirements documented in detail in Section I.F of the FOA. The key
program objectives are outlined below in detail:\nAchieve 40%
fuel-to-electrical power generation efficiency\n- The goal of the ARPA-E
 GENSETS program is to leverage existing technologies and encourage
disruptive concepts that can realize the 40% electrical efficiency
target and deliver low cost 1 kWe systems for residential CHP
applications.\nComply with emissions standards\n- Widespread deployment
of CHP systems would result in significant reduction in CO2 emissions as
 compared to central-station power plants. However, significant
challenges exist in reducing CO, NOx and VOCs in natural gas powered CHP
 systems at the 1 kWe size. Through the GENSETS FOA, ARPA-E is expecting
 generator concepts with high combustion efficiencies that produce
emissions that comply with both the 2007 CARB emissions regulations on
NOx, CO and VOCs and the EPA NSPS limit on PM. A system-out GHG limit is
 set at 1100 CO2eq lb\/MW-hr to ensure compliance with prevailing
state-level environmental standards.\nAchieve long
lifetime\/durability\n- The target for the total system life is 10 years
 with a capacity factor of 99.9%, i.e., the system should have the
capability of running continuously between services (e.g., oil change or
 cathode replacement) which should not be more than once a year,
corresponding to about 8,000 running hours between service intervals.
Based upon reported performance, this is a realistic goal to achieve for
 ICEs and Stirling engines. For example, for a 1 kWe CHP system, a
manufacturer reports 6,000 running hours or 3 years between service,
which is close to the target set by this FOA. Also, a Stirling engine
manufacturer has demonstrated maintenance-free operation for 100,000
hours (11 years) and eight other engines have more than 8,000 hours and
are still running. The system lifetime target will be a challenge for
new device types that are still rapidly-evolving in design such as solid
 state devices and micro-turbines. Accelerated testing should be used by
 GENSETS performers to project actual field lifetimes from shorter
duration test data.\nReduce system cost to enable widespread penetration
 of residential CHP\n- The total CAPEX here includes the system cost but
 excludes the installation and balance of plant costs. The CAPEX target
for the 1 kWe system is no more than $3,000.\n&amp;nbsp;\nTECHNICAL
CATEGORIES OF INTEREST\nThe ARPA-E GENSETS program will fund
transformational technologies that can create a paradigm shift in the
residential heat and power generation process. ARPA-E expects GENSETS to
 open pathways for high-efficiency, low-emissions, long-life,
cost-effective, 1-kWe generators that can enable significant energy
savings and CO2 emissions reduction.\nApplicants must present a
well-justified, realistic proposal for the design, construction, and
demonstration of a complete engine\/generator system that meets all the
technical performance targets. Specifically, the systems should accept
natural gas at standard residential delivery pressures as their only
fuel input and produce 60 Hz ac electrical output at 110 V.\nExample
technologies of interest, either as standalone solutions or in
combinations, include, but are not limited to:\n- Internal combustion
engines\n- External combustion engines such as Stirling engines and
steam engines\n- Any other novel engines (e.g. detonation engines,
thermoacoustic engines, free-piston engines, rotary engines etc.)\n-
Combustion turbines such as micro-turbines\n- Micro Rankine cycles\n-
Novel concepts that incorporate exhaust and coolant waste-heat recovery,
 reduced mechanical friction and reduced heat transfer\n- Novel concepts
 to improve combustion efficiency and emissions reduction such as
exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) or flue gas recirculation (FGR),
homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), spark-assisted HCCI
(SA-HCCI), corona ignition, and laser ignition\n- Thermophotovoltaics\n-
 Thermionic emitters\n- Thermoelectric generators\n- Pyroelectrics\n-
Ion expansion electrochemical devices for electricity generation\n-
Innovative integration of topping cycles and\/or bottoming cycles\n-
Combinations of the above devices and
concepts\n&amp;nbsp;\nSupplementary Explanations of Targets\n1.1 The
system concept should target 1-kWe generation. However, if the
efficiency target is demonstrated in a device which has &amp;lt; 1-kWe
power producing capacity, then a detailed scaling analysis should be
presented to project efficiency at 1-kWe. Systems larger than 1-kWe are
not of interest.\n1.2 Natural gas fuel to ac electricity conversion
efficiency is based on lower heating value (LHV) of pipeline natural gas
 with 983 Btu per cubic foot. Individual component efficiencies of 40%
are not sufficient. A device delivering 40% electrical efficiency
relative to its input heat energy is not acceptable. Solid-state devices
 should be treated as external combustion engines and electrical
efficiency should be described as in Eq. 1 (\u03b7e=
\u03b7comb\u2219\u03b7ind\u2219\u03b7m\u2219\u03b7alt).\n1.3 Residential
 hot-water and space heating output provided by CHP system should be
&amp;gt; 1 kW\/kWe at &amp;gt; 80 \u00b0C.\n1.4 The system is expected
to run continuously between the scheduled regular maintenance and
restart easily.&amp;nbsp;\n1.5 The engine\/generator system, including
emissions mitigation and dissipation of exhaust heat (when not fully
used), must plausibly cost less than $3,000 per kWe in large production
volumes (e.g., one million units). The $3,000 cost of the generator
system itself includes all components needed to take pipeline natural
gas and produce electricity (ac, 60 Hz) and exhaust heat as outputs; the
 costs of installation (labor) and balance of plants (smart meters and
heat exchangers for integration with other systems) of ~$1,400 are not
included. An alternator efficiency (\u03b7alt) of 0.8 to 0.96 can be
assumed for the purpose of FOA application if the alternator is not
integral to the generator under development. The alternator cost needs
to be included in the system CAPEX. The cost of commercially available
alternators varies essentially linearly as the efficiency increases from
 0.8 to 0.96 according to: Alternator cost [$] = 3250*\u03b7alt \u2013
2520. Systems that do not need an alternator can exclude this
cost.\n1.7-1.9 Emissions for NOx, CO and VOCs should comply with CARB
2007 emissions limits for distributed power generation. Full
applications must provide a complete discussion relative to the
state-of-the-art numbers in a specific category of technology (e.g. ICE)
 and how improvements are made with respect to the baseline performance
in the literature. Mitigation technologies are allowable as long as the
cost is included in the system CAPEX.\n1.10 For GHG emissions, only CO2
and CH4 are considered by the GENSETS Program. CO2eq value for CH4 must
be evaluated using its 100 year GWP value of 28, i.e., 1 g of CH4
corresponds to 28 g of CO2eq. The total system-out CO2eq must be less
than 1100 lb\/MW-hr.\n1.13 The system must be able to operate at methane
 numbers as low as 70. Methane number is defined using the following
equations:\nMotor octane number (MON) = -406.14 + 508.04*(H\/C) \u2013
173.55*(H\/C) 2 + 20.17*(H\/C) 3\nMethane number (MN) = 1.624*MON \u2013
 119.1. H\/C is the fuel hydrogen to carbon ratio.\nA Wobbe index of
1328 \u00b18% is allowed to accommodate different natural gas
compositions.\n&amp;nbsp;\nAPPLICATIONS SPECIFICALLY NOT OF
INTEREST\nThe following types of applications will be deemed
nonresponsive and will not be reviewed or considered (see Section
III.F.2 of the FOA):\n- Applications submitted by entities or
organizations other than Small Business Concerns.\n- For the STTR
program, applications submitted without one Research Institution as a
member of the project team.\n- Applications that fall outside the

        "description": "\n\tBackground\n\n\tNatural products are
essential sources of medicines. The World Health Organization estimates
that ~80% of the world&amp;rsquo;s population relies on traditional
medicines made from natural products. The modern pharmaceutical industry
 is also dependent on plant-based medicines, with as much as 50% of all
drugs based on natural products or derived from a natural product
origin. Clearly, plants and other natural products offer excellent
sources of health-promoting medicines. Thus it is extremely important
that we enhance our capacity to further examine these traditional
modalities and achieve a solid scientific understanding of their
potential health benefits.\n\n\tNonetheless, substantial problems exist
in identifying and understanding natural products and their bioactivity.
 While the potential for natural products in health and wellbeing is
clear, the challenges that hamper the full utilization of these
resources are many, with the greatest hurdle simply being the enormous
amount of time and effort required for structure identification and
characterization of the mechanisms by which natural products exert their
 pharmacological activity. Improvements in collection, bioassay,
isolation, purification, de-replication, yield, and supply of natural
products are possible. While advances have been made to help overcome
these hurdles, there exist many new untapped technological resources
that may improve natural products research methodologies.\n\n\tResearch
Objectives\n\n\tThe purpose of NCCIH&amp;rsquo;s Small Business
Innovative Research (SBIR) Grant program is to stimulate technological
innovation in the private sector, strengthen the role of small business
in meeting Federal research or research and development needs, and
improve the return on investment from Federally-funded research for
economic and social benefits to the Nation.\n\n\tNatural products offer a
 diverse reservoir of biologically active components. The single
chemical entities, as well as their mixtures in natural product
extracts, have a long history of use as drugs, drug precursors, and\/or
complementary health adjuvants. However, methodologies for the
identification of bioactive natural products and their mechanism(s) of
pharmacological action are often inadequate or too time consuming to be
compatible with modern screening platforms. We believe that many
existing biotechnologies could be adapted to improve natural products
research. Innovative methods might utilize genomics, bio-products
engineering, bioinformatics, synthetic and molecular biology, or
nanotechnology. The purpose of this initiative is to improve upon the
currently available natural products methodologies thereby increasing
the efficiency of research in this field.\n\n\tWith this SBIR
initiative, NCCIH is proposing to focus on five areas that could
significantly improve the progress in natural products
research:\n\n\t\n\t\tTechnologies aimed at improving field applications
for characterizing natural product sources\/species and their diverse
bioactive constituents, (examples &amp;ndash; DNA barcoding, gene chips,
 activity based profiling, biosensors, spectrometric equipment and
techniques, etc.)\n\t\n\t\tTechnologies aimed at the rapid removal of
nuisance compounds in the crude extracts of natural products, (examples
&amp;ndash; innovative chromatographic technologies, resins, catch and
release-type systems, etc.)\n\t\n\t\tTechnologies aimed at the
development of highly sensitive phenotypic\/high content bioassays
including capacity to identify potential synergistic mechanisms,
(examples - image-based cellular assays, multiple-endpoint analysis
based on phenotypic changes, bioengineering chemically sensitive
strains, etc.)\n\t\n\t\tTechnologies aimed at the creation and
exploitation of model systems for the expression of natural product
constituents in high product yielding hosts, (broad spectrum
heterologous or homologous expression hosts, stimulation of biosynthetic
 pathways, mutation, etc.) and\n\t\n\t\tTechnologies aimed at predicting
 and\/or quantifying risks of natural product&amp;ndash;drug
interactions (examples &amp;ndash; designed in vitro interaction assays
or kits, in silico technologies, etc.)\n\n\n\tThis FOA is intended to
help move useful technologies from non-commercial laboratories into the
commercial marketplace by inviting SBIR grant applications from
successful small businesses for further development of such technologies
 that are relevant to the missions of the sponsoring NIH institutes and
centers. The supported research and development will likely include
making the tools more robust and easy to use, and will likely require
close collaboration between the original developers of these
technologies and SBCs. These partnerships may be accomplished in any of a
 number of ways, including the use of multiple Program
Directors\/Principal Investigators. NCCIH encourages new investigators
as well as those investigators who are previous recipients and have
shown significant progress in moving useful technologies from
non-commercial laboratories into the commercial marketplace.\n\n\tTopics
 that are not responsive to this FOA include:\n\n\t\n\t\tApproaches
applicable to only one organism, biosynthetic pathway, and\/or natural
product or are of limited scope\n\t\n\t\tApproaches focused primarily on
 the production of analogs of natural products\n\t\n\t\tOptimization of
large-scale production of natural products\n\t\n\t\tChemical synthesis
of natural products\n\t\n\t\tCharacterization of biosynthetic enzymes of
 established or easily predictable function\n\t\n\t\tApproaches focused
on spectral libraries of natural products\n\t\n\t\tApproaches based on
collection or storage of natural products for screening\n\n",

        "topic_name": "Tools and Services for Designing Methodologically
 Rigorous Animal Studies (R43\/R44)",
        "description": "Animal studies play a vital role in science. In
scientific research, laboratory animals are used to develop and test
putative medications, to elucidate normal biological processes, and to
study genes\/mutations found in both animals and humans, among others.
National Institutes of Health (NIH) is diligent in following the
guidelines for ethical conduct in the care and use of animal in
research. Finding the appropriate balance between the goals of
minimizing the use of animals in research and utilizing the sufficient
number of animals in the adequately powered experiments is the task
requiring stellar knowledge of the experimental study design and
statistics. Unfortunately, the current reality is that in the US many
graduate students (and others who are receiving training in the life
sciences) receive little formal instruction in experimental design and
variable training in statistics. Although some statistical packages
(SPSS, SAS, Epi-6) are commercially available, their use without
practical understanding of animal study design and methodological rigor
is often inappropriate and misguided. While life scientists are advised
to seek assistance of professional statisticians at their home
institutions, this professional help is often not available or easily
accessible.\nThe purpose of this FOA is to encourage Small Business
Concerns (SBCs) to submit applications to create and develop the tools
and services that will guide and assist scientists to properly design
animal studies. It is understood that the tools\/services produced as
the result of this FOA are not intended to fully replace critical
thinking and years of scientific training. It is likely that to address
the goals of this FOA, the proposed solutions, tools and\/or services
will be multi-modular in nature. To be responsive to this FOA, the
applications must be focused on concurrently addressing the three
following technical parameters in the applications: 1) The proposed
tools\/services must allow for personalized (e.g., face-to-face, on-line
 chat) access to the professional statisticians and experimental design
professionals, preferably, in real time; 2) The proposed tools\/services
 must be, at least, based on the core set of research
parameters\/reporting standards as described in&amp;nbsp; Nature,
490,187\u2013191, 11 October 2012 see:
http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v490\/n7419\/full\/nature11556.html;
 3) The proposed tools\/services must &amp;nbsp;be designed to inform
the sustainable implementation from the start.\nThe availability,
assistance and participation of highly trained statistical staff in
experimental designs is universally accepted as imperative; however,
this type of support in not commonly available or accessible. Thus, the
personal technical assistance element of the proposals submitted in
response to this FOA is required. The SBC-applicants will be responsible
 for the designing the knowledge-based experimental design element of
the overall tool\/service. Overall, the thorough curation of the
relevant literature by the applicant is expected.\nResearch projects
responsive to the goals of this FOA include, but are not limited to, the
 research and development of the bundled service, including a
subscription to on-line software for animal study design with
user-friendly and readily accessible web interface (e.g., Module 1:
Experimental Design Module), and \u201creal time\u201d access to
additional technical\/professional support (e.g., Module 2: Personal
Assistance Module). The sustainability of such SBIR project could be
assured and exemplified by providing access to this bundled service
utilizing Software as a Service (SaaS) model. SaaS allows organizations
to access business functionality with the pricing based on a monthly
fee. Because the software is hosted remotely, users don't need to invest
 in additional hardware. For example, upon implementation by successful
SBC, the customer (a life science researcher from academia or industry)
would purchase SBC\u2019s bundled service to generate a proper in vivo
study design and to obtain a certificate of service assurance. Models
different from SaaS models can be proposed as long as it assures
sustainable implementation. The support for tool\/service design for
sustainable implementation from the start emphasis reflects NIDA's
desire to contribute its funding to projects resulting in
commercialization. To ensure that the developed product or service
reaches the market and is successfully disseminated into the scientific
community, the applicants are encouraged to complete necessary due
diligence, identify the best business development model for
commercialization and perform all relevant work to develop a strong
value proposition.&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\nSpecial
Considerations\nHIV\/AIDS Counseling and Testing Policy for the National
 Institute on Drug Abuse:&amp;nbsp; In light of recent significant
advances in rapid testing for HIV and in effective treatments for HIV,
NIDA has revised its 2001 policy on HIV counseling and
testing.&amp;nbsp; NIDA-funded researchers are strongly encouraged to
provide and\/or refer research subjects to HIV risk reduction education
and education about the benefits of HIV treatment, counseling and
testing, referral to treatment, and other appropriate interventions to
prevent acquisition and transmission of HIV.&amp;nbsp; This policy
applies to all NIDA funded research conducted domestically or
internationally.&amp;nbsp; For more information see

Population Health and Eliminating Health Disparities (R43\/R44)",
        "description": "Purpose\nThe purpose of this funding opportunity
 is to engage small business concerns (SBC) in developing technologies
and products that engage, empower, and motivate individuals and
communities, including providers and healthcare institutions, in
sustainable health promoting activities and interventions that lead to
improved health, healthcare delivery, and the elimination of health
disparities. Healthy People 2020 defines a health disparity as a
particular type of health difference in the incidence, prevalence,
morbidity, and burden of diseases and other adverse health outcomes that
 is closely linked with social, economic, and\/or environmental
disadvantage. NIH-defined health disparity population groups include
racial\/ethnic minorities (African Americans, American Indians, Alaska
Natives, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and
other U.S. Pacific Islanders), socioeconomically disadvantaged
individuals, and individuals residing in rural areas.&amp;nbsp;
Appropriate technologies should be effective, affordable, culturally
acceptable, and easily accessible to those who need them.&amp;nbsp; This
 announcement is expected to reduce health disparities within and across
 the priority areas of cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes,
 HIV\/AIDS, infant mortality, mental health, and obesity, as well as
lung, liver, and kidney diseases, psoriasis, scleroderma, and other
diseases, illnesses, and conditions of public health
importance.\nBackground\nOver the years, there has been continued
improvement of health for all Americans with the introduction of medical
 and scientific advances. Despite notable improvements gained as a
result of the technological advancement, there continues to be an
alarming disproportionate burden of illness among minority and other
health disparity populations. Overcoming persistent disparities in
healthcare access and health outcomes remains a foremost challenge. To
meet this challenge, the NIMHD is committed to supporting a wide range
of research, aimed at the development of innovative diagnostics,
treatments, and preventative strategies to reduce, and eventually
eliminate health disparities.\nResearch Objectives\nNIMHD is committed
to supporting a wide range of research aimed at the development of
innovative diagnostics, treatments, and preventative strategies and
making these products available and accessible to those individuals and
communities bearing disproportionate burdens of illness. Technologies to
 address the unique challenges encountered in rural areas are of
particular interest, including technologies to support healthy eating
and active living, access and utilization of important government
services and new scientific information and technologies that can help
improve their quality of life; decrease food insecurity and decrease
childhood obesity rates. Technologies to be developed may be new and
innovative or they may arise from existing technologies that by redesign
 create increased and more attractive opportunities for health disparity
 populations to experience better health, improve their current health,
prevent and treat disease, and maintain a long and healthy lifestyle.
Nutrition related technologies should not duplicate existing information
 and should use science-based nutrition content from the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans, 2015 or from sources of federal nutrition
communications for the public, such as
http:\/\/www.choosemyplate.gov\nor
http:\/\/www.fns.usda.gov\/tn\/team-nutrition. Empowering technologies
are appealing, attractive, accessible, easy to use, adoptable,
affordable and sustainable. To be effective, a technology should provide
 users improvements in access, affordability, health status and
well-being relative to their current health status and well-being. The
technology should be reliable, robust, and have reproducible outcomes.
Ideally, the proposed technology should improve health through increased
 opportunities for enhanced access to:&amp;nbsp;\n\nHealthcare
institutions and providers, including those in geographically remote or
physically difficult to access locations;\nNew or increased patient
populations especially, those located in geographically remote or
physically difficult to access locations;\nMedical and health knowledge
through increased opportunities for individuals with limited English
proficiency or low health, food or media literacy;\nDiverse medical and
non-medical providers and organizations, including medical specialists,
appropriately resourced small or large centers with access to advanced
medical technologies,&amp;nbsp; and organizations dedicated to health
promotion through access to nutritious food, such as farmers markets,
etc.;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\nPublicly available resources including free
and\/or affordable and sustainable insurance coverage, enrollment in
social safety net programs, such as the women, infants, and children
special supplemental nutrition program (WIC), Medicaid, social security,
 school meals, etc.;\nHealthcare delivered in culturally acceptable and
respectful manners and in safe environments; and\nQuality healthcare

Counterfeit Electronic Material",
        "description": "Counterfeit and subversively modified electronic
 components represent a substantial threat to Department of Defense
(DoD) systems. Testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC)
concluded that \u201cthe scope and impact of counterfeits is not known
\u2026 counterfeit electronic parts can compromise performance and
reliability, risk national security, and endanger the safety of military
 personnel \u2026 [and] weaknesses in the testing for electronic parts
create vulnerabilities that are exploited by counterfeiters\u201d [1].
The need for advanced tools with widespread applicability towards
electronics employed by the DoD is evident. The latest, most
sophisticated forms of counterfeiting includes cloned integrated
circuits (ICs), overproduced ICs, and tampered ICs created by
state-sponsored counterfeiters, with the goal of embedding a back door
and\/or the capability to remotely disrupt\/disable\/destroy the system
the IC is installed in. Cloned ICs are created when a component is
reverse engineered, then produced without the permission of the Original
 Component Manufacturer (OCM). Currently, extensive electrical testing
is required to detect advanced counterfeit components such as cloned
ICs. Such testing requires expensive equipment, is time consuming,
requires extensive data and cooperation from the OCM, and results vary
wildly, depending on interpretation by subject matter experts (SMEs)
[2]. Although automated inspection equipment may help identify tampered
or cloned components, extensive work has been done to camouflage IC
layouts and standard cell functionality, which is capable of defeating
automated inspection [3]. A tool is required which can rapidly detect
and compare the characteristic EM emissions and reflections of a device,
 in real time. Such a tool would be able to detect cloned and tampered
ICs unless they were made with the exact same material, via the same
processes, by the same production equipment. By capturing and comparing
the unique signature or \u201cfingerprint\u201d of each component, the
most sophisticated counterfeit components would be detected before
installation. Electronic components exhibit characteristic
electromagnetic responses when powered. These responses are currently
being used for quality control, electronic health monitoring, and
counterfeit detection.DMEA is seeking a novel tool which
electromagnetically scans an electronic device without need for a test
fixture and when the device is in both a powered-on and powered-off
state. The tool should be able to simultaneously illuminate the device
via EM radiation and collect its characteristic responses to
illumination to non-destructively determine part authenticity and
identify any subversive modifications made to the part. This
re-radiation of the incident EM energy is analogous to X-ray
fluorescence, in that the resulting radiation is unique to the inspected
 component. Only devices made of the exact same material, via the same
processes, will exhibit identical signatures. Assessment of electronic
components must be made in real-time (no post-processing required) and
able to be performed by an operator with minimal training. The tool
needs to be applicable to a wide range of device types and sizes and be
able to detect multiple types of typical and sophisticated counterfeit
modalities. The developed tool must be capable of achieving a Pd of
&amp;gt;95% with a FAR of &amp;lt;5% to avoid adverse effects on trusted
 materiel in the DoD supply chain. PHASE I: The goal of Phase I is to
establish a design for a proof-of-concept tool capable of remotely
scanning an electronic component with free field EM energy to assess its
 authenticity and proper functionality. Proof-of-concept should be
established through laboratory experimentation on representative
material. The technique must be environmentally safe and not exceed
MIL-STD-461 emissions requirements. Utilization of actual counterfeit,
defective, and\/or subversively modified components in establishing
feasibility is desirable. The hardware and software architecture needed
for an integrated tool will be designed. At the conclusion of this phase
 a feasibility study report will be produced. PHASE II: Phase II will
build and test a prototype version of the assessment tool whose
architecture was designed under Phase I. Prototype demonstration will
include tests performed on relevant electronic devices to determine
performance statistics (Pd, FAR). In conjunction with the demonstration,
 a detailed plan for achieving Manufacturing Readiness Level &amp;gt;6
and for transitioning the tool for insertion within the DoD supply chain
 will be prepared. PHASE III: Phase III will transition the developed
tool for active use by the DoD, academic and private sectors.
Commercialization of the concept will occur as SMEs from each sector
have identified a critical need for such capabilities. Integration and
testing will be coordinated with a DoD organization that handles
electronic parts within the supply chain. Additional government and
commercial insertion points for the screening tool will be identified.",

        "topic_name": "Analysis of Integrated Circuits Using Limited
X-rays",
        "description": "The DARPA TRUST program established the
potential usefulness of using an X-Ray microscope to analyze ICs at a
synchrotron. We would like to further that development using a lab based
 X-Ray source. When utilizing a lab X-ray source, acquisition times for
X-ray images increase significantly compared to using a synchrotron
X-ray source. This is due to the decreased number of X-ray photons
(i.e., X-ray flux) produced by a lab source. This reduced X-ray flux
combined with a relatively large imaging area makes image acquisition
prohibitively slow at the resolution required for the analysis of modern
 ICs. It therefore becomes necessary to develop an approach to X-ray
imaging that can minimize the imaging time, while still being able to
reconstruct the internals of a multilayer laminar IC. This problem is
very similar to the one faced in medical imaging to reduce the total
radiation dosage to a patient. However, unlike in medical imaging, the
internal structure of ICs is very regular and defined by design rules.
These design rules limit the geometries and materials used in an IC.
This a priori information can be combined with recent advances in low
dose X-ray imaging to create software with innovative algorithms
optimized for IC inspection. The X-ray microscope, for which the imaging
 approach will be applicable, will conform to the following: 1) Sample
will be mounted on a stage with at least four degrees of freedom (i.e.,
x, y, z, and rotation around an axis). 2) Stage positional uncertainty
(i.e., error in reported position) will be smaller than the minimum
feature size. 3) A scintillator and camera will be used to acquire an
X-ray image of a specific region of the sample at a time. This region
will be much smaller than the area of interest; therefore, many images
will need to be taken and stitched together to image the entire area of
interest. 4) Image data can be sent to a computer for real-time analysis
 and there will be an interface for a computer to control the stage and
image acquisition equipment. This communication can be used to
dynamically optimize the scanning and reconstruction algorithms. The
software is required to do the following: 1) Direct the X-ray microscope
 to acquire X-ray images. a. Interface to microscope will allow the
following to be controlled: i. x, y, and z position. ii. Angle iii.
X-ray exposure time b. Software will need to decide the best way to
position the sample and at which angles to acquire images to minimize
the total time it takes to image the IC. 2) Analyze the resulting X-ray
images in such a way that the conductors in the entire IC are modeled a.
 A 3D model is anticipated as the output format. b. The data must be
segmented based on X-ray absorption contrast.\n\nPHASE I: Conduct
research on algorithms for X-ray image analysis and evaluate their
application to imaging ICs as described in the paragraphs above.
Conceive of a system in which an IC is placed in an X-ray microscope and
 software is run that utilizes the microscope to create a 3D map of the
conductors in the IC while minimizing the X-ray imaging time. Propose a
design for that software and determine its technical capabilities. The
end product of Phase I is a feasibility study report, in which the
following must be specified:\n1. The hardware required to execute the
software program (e.g., Desktop computer, HPC, GPUs, Intel Phi, etc.).
We expect the software to take advantage of parallel processing and to
scale with the processing resources available.\n2. A list of assumptions
 or requirements of the X-ray microscope beyond what is listed in this
document.\n3. A list of assumptions or requirements of the IC being
imaged.\n4. A clear description of the X-ray acquisition algorithm and
why it is advantageous.\n5. A clear description of the reconstruction
algorithm and why it is advantageous.\n6. A clear description of the
analysis algorithms and why they are advantageous.\n7. An estimate of
imaging time for a 5mm x 5mm, 9 layer, 90nm technology node IC given an
X-ray microscope that takes \u201ct0\u201d time to acquire a single
20\u03bcm x 20\u03bcm area image when oriented perpendicular to the
X-ray source. Include details of how this estimate is calculated. We
expect the imaging time to be less than the time it would take to scan
the whole chip at 30 angles.\na. Note that \u201ct0\u201d is expected to
 be at least 10 seconds for a lab based X-ray microscope.\n8. An
estimate of any additional processing time required after imaging is
complete. This estimate should scale with available processing
capability.\n9. An estimate of false positives, false negatives, and the
 trade space with respect to imaging speed.\n10. A clear description of
the proposed data output format and how it models the 3D structure of
the conductors of the IC and the coordinate system used.\n11. A clear
description of any inputs or operator interaction the system will
require.\n\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype of the Phase I concept and
demonstrate its operation. Validate the performance using an X-ray
microscope over multiple dissimilar, modern ICs (e.g., FPGA or
microprocessor of 90nm technology node or better) and develop a test
plan to fully characterize the prototype. The software being developed
must have a royalty-free license for the Government, including its
support service contractors, to use, modify, reproduce, release,
perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software
generated for any United States government purpose. The software under
development will operate on an X-ray microscope specified and made
available by DMEA.\nPHASE III: There may be opportunities for further
development of this software for use in a specific military or
commercial application. During a Phase III program, the contractor may
refine the performance of the design and produce pre-production
quantities for evaluation by the Government.\n\n",

launchable unmanned systems place a premium on the volume and weight
available to both primary and payload systems. For precision weapons,
the current state of the art in guidance systems was developed for
larger diameter systems (81mm and above) and are simply too large and
consume too much power to meet the needs of future precision weapon
roadmaps (targeting 60mm and below). An innovative solution that
combines all of the required processing, memory, inertial sensing, and
multi-interface capabilities into a single microchip device will enable
precision weapons as small as 30 to 40mm in diameter to be realized. For
 unmanned systems this will help to fully maximize the available payload
 volume. For both manned and unmanned systems it will decrease power
system requirements. The guidance system will reduce cost and supply
chain issues through part count reduction and commonality across
procurements. Reductions in size, weight, and power of the guidance
system will also benefit larger caliber systems. The risk lies in the
combining of electronic with different substrates and manufacturing
processes. The new guidance system will need to be a printed circuit
board (PCB) mountable, self-contained device, no larger than 13mm (L) x
13mm (W). Internal packaging can be single or multiple die, as long as
the whole device when properly secured to the PCB can be hardened to

        "topic_name": "Linear Inflow Model Synthesis for Advanced
Rotorcraft Configurations",
        "description": "Current linear rotorcraft flight dynamics models
 are dependent on finite-state inflow theory based on potential flow
modeling at the rotor plane [1]. These inflow models have few parameters
 and are readily available in linear state-space form, making them easy
to implement in flight dynamic models for stability assessment and
control system design studies. These types of models have been developed
 for [2] and extensively used in [3] modeling single main rotor
helicopters. The future Army rotorcraft fleet will include
configurations beyond the traditional single main rotor\/trail rotor
helicopters (e.g., tiltrotors and compounds) and advances in simulation
modeling are required. Physics-based inflow models (e.g. free-vortex
wake models, CFD, VPM, etc.) provide a more accurate and wholly generic
representation of the rotor wake and can capture interference effects
between the rotor and other rotors [4], other lifting surfaces, the
fuselage, and the ground [5]. Rotor interference effects become critical
 when the wake of one rotor system is immersed in another, such as in
coaxial helicopters. The physics-based models are nonlinear and so are
limited in their use in flight dynamics and control studies. State-space
 inflow models of coaxial configurations have begun to be developed, but
 validation data is limited and needs to be improved in forward and
maneuvering flight [6, 7]. A method to numerically determine a real-time
 linear state-space model directly from physics-based models that
captures the key interference effects would provide a pathway for
accurate model development and improved stability analysis and control
law design of advanced configurations. The goal of the effort will be to
 develop and validate a methodology to determine linear time-invariant
(LTI) parametric inflow models from physics-based models for any
rotorcraft configuration. The parametric model should include
interference effects of other aircraft components. The inflow model
should be easily included in existing rotorcraft simulation tools. The
methodology should be applicable to not only single main rotor
helicopters, for which linear inflow models exist, but be generic and
easily extendible to coaxial, compound, or other rotorcraft
configurations. The validation should consist of wake and full aircraft
dynamics comparisons (e.g. time histories, frequency responses, trim
analysis, etc.) with higher-order models, the non-linear simulation from
 which the model was derived, and experimental\/flight data, if
available. The methodology developed would reduce the iterative nature
of control law design and lead to cost savings and increased efficiency
in the development process of aircraft flight control systems. The
feasibility for determining accurate linear inflow models for advanced
rotorcraft configurations and an initial model structure will be
established in Phase I. If the ability is confirmed, Phase II will fully
 develop the capability. The primary interests of this study are (1)
linearization capability, (2) accuracy, and (3) scalability of parameter
 representations. There are broad dual-use applications for a linear
representation of advanced rotorcraft inflow dynamics. Major military
rotorcraft manufactures all have multi-rotor aircraft and other advanced
 configurations in use or development. The inflow modeling of these
configurations has proven to be problematic and a key barrier to proper
predictive capability of the aircraft flight dynamics
characteristics.\nPHASE I: Determine the feasibility to extract a
real-time parametric linear inflow model for advanced rotorcraft
configurations from a physics-based model that includes interference
effects of other aircraft components. Propose an initial model structure
 and compare to other inflow model types and document the advantages and
 disadvantages of each method. Describe the methodology that will be
used to obtain the model and all simplifications or assumptions needed
to produce the linear model. Describe the process that will be used to
obtain time history and frequency response data for validation.\n\nPHASE
 II: Develop and validate a software tool that implements a numerical
method to generate parameterized LTI state-space inflow models for use
in rotorcraft flight dynamics analysis. The tool should require generic
inputs, including aircraft states and control inputs, and be able to
correctly predict the inflow at the rotor(s) in both hover and forward
flight. The model should be applicable to a range of physics-based
models. Demonstrate the derived model in a flight dynamics simulation of
 a representative test aircraft. Compare results of this model with
prior work using finite-state and higher-order models, including
predictions of transient response with flight test data. Model
predictive capability will be evaluated by comparing time histories and
frequency responses of the high-order and linear models. Time histories
should provide an error of 25% or less, and the frequency responses
should have costs of less than 100 [8]. Provide documentation for
incorporation of this model with existing flight dynamics modeling
tools.\n\nPHASE III: Transition the tool for commercial use with
military and industry customers. Since the developed tool is generic, it
 will be compatible with each customer\u2019s existing physics-based
inflow models. The government will use the tool to develop accurate
flight dynamics models to support handling qualities (through piloted
simulation) and control law development for advanced rotorcraft
configurations. Industry customers could use the tool for similar
purposes.",

Protection",

optical inserts for wearers requiring optical correction. Use of optical
 correction inserts limit optical compatibility with night vision
goggles and weapon systems due to the added eye relief. One reason
individual high index lenses are not used is because they cost seven
times more than vision correction inserts. Additionally, polycarbonate
lenses have distortions for diopters above positive 6 and below negative
 6. Logistics associated with optical inserts are costly due to the need
 for stocking inserts because inserts may require yearly exchange based
on annual vision exams. Similarly, stocking custom lenses to accommodate
 every soldier is not logistically possible or cost effective.
Technology is needed that can provide on-the-fly adjustable focus lenses
 to accommodate all wearers. The vision correction could be adjusted as a
 wearer\u2019s vision changes. Ideally, these lenses could be built into
 the respiratory protection system and would reduce overall eye relief.
There are many technology concepts for adjustable focus eyeglasses.
However, none have been demonstrated to work in a respiratory protective

correction needed by the military (-9 to 9 diopters). The current effort
 would develop novel adjustable focus lenses to allow wearers to focus
on both near and distance objects with one lens. The adjustable focus

Biomanufacturing",
        "description": "There is a critical need for capabilities that
will enable DoD to leverage the unique and powerful attributes of
biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials,
 novel capabilities, fuels, and medicines. This topic is focused on
improving the utility of cell-free systems as a platform technology to
address key technical hurdles associated with current practices in
engineering biology.\nA successful platform should address several or
all of the bottlenecks associated with the state-of-the-art in cell-free
 systems, including production of cell-free reagents with improved
consistency and scalability, improved methods for characterizing and
validating cell-free reagent preparations, new cell-free systems to
expand the number of organisms capable of being modeled, and improved
reproducibility of results over scaled volumes. In addition, these
cell-free platforms should be distributable in a format that can be
readily transitioned to academic, government, and commercial
researchers, all of whom rely on the ability to rapidly assay engineered
 biological systems.\nBiological production platforms have great
potential to provide new materials, capabilities, and manufacturing
paradigms for the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Nation. However,
the complete realization of this potential has been limited by current
approaches to engineering biology that rely on ad hoc, laborious, and
time-consuming processes, as well as the large amount of trial and error
 required to generate designs of even moderate complexity.\nOne
technology that could address many of these bottlenecks is the use of
cell-free systems for the rapid prototyping and testing of biological
systems. Conventional approaches to engineering genetic systems rely on
molecular cloning into DNA vectors, transformation or transfection of
cells, antibiotic resistance-based selection, growth in appropriate
media, and assaying cells for the desired function. While significant
progress has been made toward improving these processes, engineering
living cells is inherently costly, slow, and complex.\nBy short
circuiting many of the steps required for in vivo gene expression,
cell-free systems offer several advantages that could potentially
transform the state-of-the-art, including reduced cost, increased
throughput, decreased system complexity, and the ability to be utilized
in a distributed setting. In addition, cell-free systems enable the
production and testing of cytotoxic compounds, the prototyping of
pathways with toxic metabolic intermediates, and for the production of
molecules, such as proteins containing non-standard amino acids, that
are difficult to engineer into living systems. Although the use of
cell-free assays has significant potential to rapidly engineer and test
biological systems, several technical hurdles remain that have prevented
 widespread adoption of the technology.\nMethods for preparing reagents
used in cell-free experiments are often inconsistent, which can lead to
irreproducible results. In addition, current methods do not produce
batches of a sufficient volume of high quality reagent to enable
widespread use. Furthermore, existing internal controls are insufficient
 for the complete characterization and validation of reagents, which
makes instituting process controls difficult. The cell-free platform
itself also requires improvement, as only relatively simple biological
processes have been demonstrated and in only a handful of organismal
environments.\nPHASE I: Develop an initial design and determine the
technical feasibility of a technology platform for the consistent and
large-scale production of cell-free reagents from multiple organisms,
including methodologies for characterization and validation. Develop
detailed analysis of the cell-free platform\u2019s predicted performance
 characteristics including, but not limited to, total volume of reagent
to be produced, batch volume and variability, organisms to be utilized,
cost per unit, and distribution format. Include analysis of predicted
performance relative to current standard practices. Define key component
 technological milestones and metrics and establish the minimum
performance goals necessary to achieve successful execution of the
cell-free platform. Phase I deliverables will include: a detailed
analysis of the proposed platform, a technical report detailing
experiments and results supporting the feasibility of the approach, and
defined milestones and metrics as appropriate for the program goals.
Also included with the Phase I deliverables is a Phase II plan for
transitioning initial designs and proof-of-concept experiments into
protocols that are sufficiently robust and reproducible to be viable as
commercial technologies.\nPHASE II: Finalize the design from Phase I and
 initiate the development and production of the cell-free platform.
Establish appropriate performance parameters through experimentation to
determine the efficaciousness, robustness, and fidelity of the approach
being pursued. Develop, demonstrate, and validate the reagents and
protocols necessary to meet the key metrics as defined for the program,
and provide an experimentally validated comparison of the new methods
relative to competing state-of-the-art processes. Phase II deliverables
include a prototype set of cell-free reagents, including for new
organismal systems, and valid test data, appropriate for a commercial
production path.\nPHASE III: The widespread availability and use of
cell-free systems will further enable the rapid engineering and
optimization of biologically-based manufacturing platforms for the
production of previously inaccessible technologies and products, and
will facilitate the rapid prototyping of multi-pathway metabolic designs
 necessary for the engineering of complex biological systems. This will
enable DoD to leverage the unique and powerful attributes of biology to
solve challenges associated with production of new materials, novel
capabilities, fuels, and medicines, while providing novel solutions and
enhancements to military needs and capabilities. The successful
development of reliable and distributable cell-free platforms for
rapidly prototyping biological systems will have widespread applications
 across the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries including rapid,
 optimized production of high value chemicals, industrial enzymes,
diagnostics, and therapeutics. These cell-free platforms will be
impactful for industrial biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms, as well
 as government and academic research-scale operations.\n",

        "topic_name": "Smart Split Neck Seals for Respiratory
Protection",
        "description": "Current respiratory protection neck seal systems
 do not incorporate smart sensing technologies. Current neck seal
systems are simply basic circular rubber cut-outs and are required to be
 constructed of one continuous piece of material. Many wearers find
traditional neck seals to be uncomfortable. Respiratory protection
systems utilized for fixed wing aircraft pilots (e.g. JSAM-FW, AR-5, and
 AERP), as well as escape purposes (e.g. JSCESM and NIOSH CBRN escape
hoods) utilize neck seals as a primary protective barrier. These one
piece neck seals may only be donned by pulling the system over the head
and down onto the neck. This donning methodology limitation greatly
impacts the overall system design, its ability to be worn concurrent
with other forms of head-borne PPE, and wearer acceptance. Innovative
technology is needed that can allow for a smart split neck seal design
that allows for donning versatility, improved comfort, and the provision
 of user feedback regarding seal performance. Application of smart
technology to a neck seal will provide an additional option for wearers
with facial hair and\/or spectacles (optical correction), would assist
in avoiding seal collisions with concurrently worn headgear (e.g. helmet
 chin straps), and would allow for optional overlapping neck seal wrap
designs as opposed to the current continuous neck seal that must be
donned over the head. Sensor technology that would continually assess
the integrity of the seal but does not require the presence of a
specific threat challenge is desired. This sensor would help balance
comfort with protection in ensuring that a hermetic neck seal is
maintained around the entire circumference of the neck while
concurrently ensuring the pressures at the neck are not excessive
leading to discomfort. Many types of flexible electronics and
pressure-sensitive devices have been constructed from thin films,
micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and nanowires. However, none
have been demonstrated to work in a respiratory protective mask seal
system. The current effort would develop not only a novel split neck
seal design but also an innovative sensor technology to enhance the
sealing of the respiratory protective mask. The sensor would ensure the
mask seal maintains proper pressure with the neck skin surface to
prevent breakage of the mask seal. In addition, the sensors would be
utilized to ensure that both sections of the two piece seal design
adequately adhere to one another to form a continuous hermetic sealing
surface. The resultant system must be hygienic, durable, and easy to
clean. The sensor should be able to be integrated with the seal of the
mask, should be lightweight, and should not impact the flexibility or
extensibility of the sealing surface. The system must be able to
withstand a large range of temperature and environmental extremes and
must be resistant to chemical, biological, and non-traditional threat
agents. Lastly, the split neck seal system with the seal sensor should
not add more than thirty dollars to the cost of the system in which it
is intended to be integrated.\n\nPHASE I: Investigate material sealing
methodologies (e.g. ferrofluids, advanced closure systems, etc.) that
would allow for the development of a split neck seal design with a
hermetic closure. Identify seal performance and wearer comfort metrics
for the neck while wearing a full facepiece respirator that seals to the
 neck. Identify appropriate sensor technology for the proposed split
seal design. Demonstrate that selected material sealing technology
provides a hermetic seal to the geometry of the neck (e.g., on a
headform) and to itself (as a neck closure). A negative pressure between
 10 to 15 cmH2O shall be applied to the neck seal and maintained for 30
sec with less than a 2.5 cmH2O drop in pressure.\n\nPHASE II: Refine
seal performance and develop sensor. Develop sensor technology
identified in Phase I. Provide a functioning prototype sensor. The
developed sensors should detect a seal performance change of less than
or equal to 2% within a time period of 0.2 seconds (e.g. for a pressure
sensor, detect a pressure change of less than or equal to 2% of the
identified pressures). Apply the developed sensors to actual neck seal
geometries to demonstrate performance. Concepts for a split seal design,
 seal performance indicator, and for electronic user adjustable and
automatic fit control shall be demonstrated. Demonstrate the technology
can quickly identify repeated seal breaks occurring in the same region.
Develop ability to store baseline pressures acquired during a successful
 fit test. Develop and demonstrate indicator technology to warn user of
seal breaks and\/or differences in fit from the baseline. Provide a
capability for visualization of the potential leak location. Provide
pre-production prototype of both face and neck seal respirators with
embedded Smart Seal technology. Provide a means for self-calibration of
the sensor and seal technology. Demonstrate the flexibility of the
existing sealing surface does not change by more than 2% due to the
sensor technology. Total weight of the sensors, housing, and electronics
 including power source should not exceed 50 g. Demonstrate that the
system can be electronically adjusted by the wearer to improve fit and
that an automatic fit control option is provided and these controls are
capable for achieving suitable fit and fit adjustment during simulated
workplace protection factor testing.\n\nPHASE III: Complete system
refinement. Optimize fabrication process to demonstrate large-scale
production capabilities. Demonstrate ability of the technology to be
incorporated into a full facepiece respirator prototype. Demonstrate the
 technology is durable and suitable for military combat
applications.\n\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Potential alternative
applications include industrial, international, and commercial
respiratory protection systems as well as protective clothing seals and
closures.\n\n",

        "topic_name": "Development of Mycotoxin Medical
Countermeasures",
        "description": "Mycotoxins are toxins produced by several
species of fungi. Exposure to these toxins can result in incapacitation
or even death of the exposed subject. From a biological warfare
perspective, mycotoxins are relatively easy to produce in large
quantities and many of them have nearly effortless accessibility. For
these reasons, mycotoxins present a real threat to the warfighter.
Trichothecene (T-2), a type of mycotoxin, can be delivered via food or
water sources, droplets, aerosols, or smoke from various dispersal
systems and exploding munitions. T-2 toxin has allegedly been used as a
biological weapon in the past. For example, due to its high thermal
stability, T-2 toxin has been baked into bread, yet maintains activity.
T-2 toxin is also extremely resistant to ultraviolet light inactivation.
 As with virtually all toxins, T-2 toxin is far more toxic when inhaled
rather than through oral, dermal, or injection exposure. Aflatoxin is a
fungal toxin that commonly contaminates maize and other types of crops
during production, harvest, storage or processing. Exposure to aflatoxin
 is known to cause both chronic and acute hepatocellular injury. In
Kenya, acute aflatoxin poisoning results in liver failure and death in
up to 40% of cases. Similar to the case for T-2 toxin, aflatoxins have
high thermal and ultraviolet radiation resistance to inactivation,
making them prime candidates for weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or
weapons of mass casualties (WMC). The development of mycotoxin medical
countermeasures, specifically against aflatoxins and T-2 toxin,
addresses current technology requirements as defined by the Joint
Requirements Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JRO-CBD) and
the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense
(JPEO-CBD). Currently there are no FDA approved medical countermeasures
available for either aflatoxin or T-2 mycotoxin exposure. These toxins
are debilitating and sometimes lethal on their own. Reports in the open
literature suggest that concurrent exposure of mycotoxins in combination
 with other toxins (or pathogens), results in the increased
susceptibility to toxin induced organ damage\/failure and to increased
mortality than what is observed when either toxin is given
alone.\n\nPHASE I: Offerors must propose proof of concept experiments to
 demonstrate neutralization or attenuation of mycotoxins (of particular
interest is aflatoxin or T-2 toxin in a lethal in vitro model).
Demonstration of efficacy in some form of an in vivo model is also
acceptable, but not required for Phase I. Technologies of interest
include, but are not limited to, antibodies (human antibodies are
strongly preferred), small molecules, aptamers, and other novel
approaches. Repurposing of FDA approved drugs or drugs with successful
completion of FDA Phase I clinical trials are also to be considered.
Exit criteria for successful completion of Phase I research would be the
 demonstration of efficacy at low molar concentration in in vitro
studies or a 50% increase in survival in any animal model (assuming the
animal model has already been developed and an animal use protocol
approved). Information garnered from Phase I experiments may be more
qualitative than quantitative.\n\nPHASE II: With successful completion
of Phase I experiments, Phase II would further evaluate the medical
countermeasure (MCM) in a small mammal study. In these studies the MCM
would be administered to animals with mycotoxin only exposure and to
mycotoxin plus another toxin such as Staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA)
or Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). The animal model should be of
sufficient size and scope to demonstrate a statistically significant
increase in long-term survival in animals receiving the MCM. The SBIR
Phase II studies shall design experiments in a manner that facilitates
the collection of non-clinical GLP pharmacokinetic (PK) and
pharmacodynamic (PD) data. The PK and PD information will be of
paramount importance to inform subsequent Phase III studies.\n\nPHASE
III: Phase III studies would further refine the animal model and the
compound\/drug dosing regimen. The goal would be to work towards FDA
approval of a MCM for one or more mycotoxins to include aflatoxin(s)
and\/or T-2 toxin(s). FDA licensure\/approval is not necessary for the
project to be deemed successful. However, an objective demonstration of
MCM efficacy in at least an animal model relevant to the human
condition, and\/or successful completion of an FDA approved clinical
trial, with accompanying efficacy demonstrated in an animal model is
required for success to be declared. One means for the offeror to
document progress in the right direction is through a Technology
Readiness Assessment (TRA) of the technology using the harmonized
Quantitative Technology Readiness Level (Q-TRL) guidance document as
described by the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures
Enterprise (PHEMCE). A second means for demonstrating success is the
establishment of funding and partnering with commercial companies (if
necessary) to bring the product to market.\nPHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: Successful MCM products directed towards mycotoxins
clearly have broad dual use applicability. Acute mycotoxin intoxication
is a common occurrence throughout much of the world, usually due to the
growth of mycotoxin producing fungi on grains stored under conditions
conducive to fungal contamination.\n",

        "topic_name": "Exploiting Microbiome and Synthetic Biology to
Discover and Produce Naturally Occurring Antibiotics",
        "description": "The explosion in the \u201comics\u201d field has
 allowed for unprecedented genetic identification of some of the
billions of bacteria that comprise the world of the microbiome. A
potential wealth of information is available through the study of
species that have developed sophisticated defense mechanisms to protect
themselves from the onslaught of foreign invaders. Recent examples
include the microbiome of the new world vulture and in humans. The
potential for identification of natural product antibiotics is now
within technical reach, and could represent a large family of hitherto
unknown naturally occurring antibacterial agents. Furthermore, current
data suggest that these natural products are produced from a cluster of
genes, and likely represent a variety of agents that have singular and
synergistic effects against invading bacteria. Isolation of the natural
products, as well as elucidation of the genes involved in their
biosynthesis, might provide a number of convergent paths towards the
development of new and improved antibacterial therapeutic agents.
Another advantage of these types of investigations is the
well-established regulatory pathway to FDA approval. The ever-increasing
 discovery of drug resistant strains, such as methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), coupled with the dwindling antibiotic
research efforts in pharmaceutical companies, is one reason that
Executive Order 13676 was issued in September 2014 to expedite the
discovery and development of new antibacterial agents. The Department of
 Defense (DoD) is increasingly concerned with both multi-drug resistant
strains of bacteria, as well as those bacterial threats that could
potentially be used as biowarfare agents. In an effort to address these
gaps, the DoD is soliciting researchers who will take advantage of
recent advances in technology to identify and develop new families of
antibiotics derived from the microbiome. PHASE I: Perform
proof-of-concept studies to define the source of the microbiome, the
identity of a gene cluster relating to the biosynthesis of antibacterial
 agents, and in vitro data showing antibacterial effect. It is not
expected at this stage that any natural products will be isolated and
identified, rather that crude mixtures would be tested to show in vitro
activity. The bacterium does not, at this stage, need to be a priority
for the DoD, and could be Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia,
Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, etc. If selected for a
Phase II contract, the Phase I Option period should be used to test the
crude mixtures of natural products against bacteria of interest to the
DoD (Bacillus anthracis, Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei,
 Francisella tularensis, and Yersinia pestis). The government currently
offers a Core testing capability to perform in vitro and\/or in vivo
screening of compounds (lead, advanced, or licensed) alone or in
combination against an extensive panel of biodefense pathogens, as well
as a panel of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens, to generate minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) data at no cost, and with no intellectual
 property implications to the providing party. Offerors selected for
Phase I award will be provided additional information regarding these
opportunities. PHASE II: During Phase II, it is expected the crude
mixtures used in Phase I will be purified to homogeneity. Novel chemical
 entities will be fully defined and characterized. These materials will
be further tested for efficacy in in vitro assays. Depending on the
complexity of the structure, it may be advantageous to develop a
medicinal chemistry program around any novel chemotype discovered.
Mechanism of action studies should be commenced to understand the
target(s) of these natural products in order to further exploit the
compounds as potential therapeutics. It is further anticipated that the
cluster of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of these small
molecule compounds will be fully identified, and methods for their
expression in suitable vectors will be developed. Synthetic biology
approaches to constructing bio-factories for the large scale production
of these materials could be explored for feasibility. Structure-function
 and\/or structure-activity relationships should be established during
this Phase, and the further development of these novel compounds as
novel antibacterial agents defined. These studies would encompass a
large spectrum of bacterial targets, and identification of
broad-spectrum agents should be a priority. By studying and
understanding the mechanism of action of these compounds, it may be
advantageous to define a multi-pronged therapeutic regime similar to
what could be found in nature. The primary deliverable from this Phase
of the project will be to demonstrate in vivo efficacy (target
&amp;gt;50% survival in a lethal challenge model when initially dosed
greater than or equal to 12h post-exposure) of one or more of these
compounds against multiple bacteria, including but not limited to agents
 of interest to the DoD (B. anthracis, B. mallei, B. pseudomallei, F.
tularensis, and Y. pestis). Ideally, these compounds will show
characteristics amenable to advancement into pre-clinical and clinical
studies. PHASE III: Phase III activities will focus on advancing the
most promising candidate(s) towards the clinic and FDA approval. This
would include pre-clinical studies such as further animal efficacy
studies, pharmacology, toxicology, formulation, and dose ranging studies
 to determine likely human dosing, routes of administration, as well as
manufacturing and all requisite studies to file an Investigational New
Drug (IND) application with the FDA. PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:
Although the DoD has specific requirements for therapeutics and\/or
prophylaxis against bacterial agents that can be used as biowarfare
agents, it is fully expected that any product derived from this work
will have significant and broad commercial applications to the health
and safety of the general public.&amp;nbsp;",

infectious disease in vitro diagnostic (IVD) capabilities that are
operationally suitable for use in far forward military environments and
operationally effective versus a wide range of threats. Current single
use disposable Lateral Flow Immunoassay-based diagnostic tests have many
 desirable operational suitability characteristics (low cost, minimal
training, lightweight, results in 15 minutes, eye readable results, and
long shelf life at room temperature) but lack sufficient sensitivity to
be clinically useful for most infectious diseases. Current nucleic acid
amplification-based diagnostic tests provide adequate sensitivity for
some diseases but are slow (&gt;30 minutes), more complex, are not
compatible with many host response biomarker-based diagnostic approaches
 and have a high cost per test. The High Sensitivity, Low Complexity,
Multiplexed Diagnostic Devices topic seeks to develop novel approaches
that will fundamentally improve sensitivity while maintaining desirable
operational suitability characteristics. Furthermore, novel approaches
will be needed to incorporate multiple analytical approaches into a
single platform technology to provide clinical utility across a broad
range of etiological agents (i.e., intracellular organisms, parasites,
etc.), diseases and clinical sample types and to provide information to
support force health protection decision making.\n\nPHASE I: Describe
the specific technical approaches that would be pursued for achieving
better than state of the art clinical sensitivity (\u226590%) for acute
infections (testing occurs within the first 168 hours after symptom
on-set or pre-symptomatically) in an operationally suitable platform for

diseases of operational concern to the U.S. military that would be
pursued if selected for Phase III transition. One or more of the
representative diseases would be selected as the basis for prototype
development in Phase II depending on the specific approach proposed.
Within Phase I these five representative diseases serve as the basis for
 offerors to illustrate the innovative elements of their proposed
technical approach when applied to a specific real-world problem. For
disease specific tests, the description of the technical approach
entails a detailed description of assay designs (bio-recognition
elements), signal amplification and transduction techniques, selected
sample types (least invasive clinical sampling), and sample preparation
techniques (if any) for a specific diagnostic intended use that
illustrates the contractor\u2019s understanding of the disease, the
diagnostic problem, and improvements over the current state of the art
for the same market. The description should provide details how
sufficient inclusivity and specificity will be obtained to inform
treatment decisions. Syndromic approaches (through multiplexing) add
significantly to clinical utility. Provide an analysis of the envisioned
 technical approach with respect to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Act (CLIA) guidelines for CLIA-waived status.\n\nPHASE II: For one or
more of the test types investigated in Phase I, develop and deliver
prototype IVD device and pilot lot assays (if applicable to the system
design) to the Government for independent evaluation. Complete
pre-submission meetings with the FDA to inform inclusivity, specificity
and syndromic approaches and intended use for the test and CLIA-waived
clinical trial design. The degree of innovation will be measured by the
offeror\u2019s ability to achieve a high clinical sensitivity for a
broad range of disease and sample types while retaining operationally
desirable characteristics (cost &lt; $40 per sample analyzed, training
time less than 4 hours, system weight with consumables for 40 tests less
 than 25 lbs., single sample time to result less than 30 minutes, eye
readable results, and consumable shelf life greater than 1 year at 25C).
 By the end of Phase II, the offeror will have produced a pre-production
 prototype of the diagnostic device, optimized the assay design for
performance in the relevant clinical sample types, temperature and shelf
 life stability, and manufacturability and will be ready to begin
pre-clinical trials shortly after Phase III award.\n\nPHASE III:
Complete the maturation of all hardware, software and reagent elements
of the diagnostic device. Conduct pre-clinical and clinical trials and
510(k) package preparation and submission (as the sponsor) to the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the initial IVD product developed
 under Phase II. Conduct follow-on developments and FDA clearances of
IVD tests for additional known and emerging diseases of operational
interest to the U.S. Military. Manufacture IVD devices and assays (as
applicable to the technical approach) under Current Good Manufacturing
Practices (cGMP) and other quality systems and deliver to the Government
 for operational use by Warfighters. The Government will provide
Government Furnished Information (GFI) and Materials (GFM), when not
publically available, to support assay design and testing. The

        "description": "Asymmetric threats including chemical and
biological agents, improvised dissemination devices, and vehicle- and
personnel-born improvised explosive devices represent a persistent
hindrance to U.S. military operations. Various sensor and surveillance
systems develop a capacity to warn of the presence of such threats on a
point-by-point basis; however the consumption of these data in the
construction of a common operational picture for unit commanders remains
 an intractable challenge. Even if all of the systems were integrated
onto a common networking and communications framework so that early
warning data from any individual sensor were available in real time, the
 capacity to process and analyze such data in order to synthesize
situational understanding for leaders is extremely limited. The current
state of the art in the chemical and biological sensing paradigm is
limited to the correlation of alarm information from networked sensor
systems vis-\u00e0-vis the actual multimodal fusion of quantized native
sensor signals. Enabling technology in information theory and signal
processing continues to advance and emerge as a reasonably mature
approach toward the consumption of sensor data leading to the
development of improved situational understanding based on disparate and
 unrelated data sources. While the integration and correlation of
information has advanced in recent times due in part to improved
accessibility of networking and communications architectures, few
examples of multimodal data fusion using data from more than one sensor
have been reduced to practice. Network bandwidth continues to constrain
the content available for such systems to function; however, distributed
 processing architectures allow for the fusion of quantized native
sensor signals at outlying nodes, mitigating to some extent the size of
the data stream that must be fused at the central signal processing
node. This effort would be expected to demonstrate the unique and
invaluable power of a multimodal signal processing tier of raw sensor
data as a first tier of a layered sensing architecture that provides an
unprecedented depth of information and detection confidence that exceeds
 the baseline simple correlation approach. The system should demonstrate
 the management of uncertainty and error (e.g., position, navigation,
and timing errors and spurious alarm response signals) at various levels
 in the architecture, and incorporate the fault analysis and multimodal
fusion product along with a representation of the overall confidence
level of the final product in a fashion that is intuitive to
non-technical operational decision-makers. Such a demonstration would
serve as a validation case for arguments on the implementation of
disparate sensing architectures for threat detection and awareness. To
date, there remains a significant level of skepticism surrounding the
argument that data fusion architectures provide operational
benefit.\n\nPHASE I: Execute a comprehensive system study and define
best practices models and theory for the correlation and fusion of
weighted signal outputs from multiple sensor modalities (including but
not limited to: electro-optical\/infrared imagery, acoustic, seismic,
magnetic, passive infrared motion sensors, chemical and biological agent
 detectors, radiological detectors, explosives sensors, ground
surveillance radar, airborne imagers and LIDAR systems, unmanned aerial
vehicle imagery, aerostat imagery) in the presence of bias and other
errors, including position and time errors, and faulty sensor operation.
 Assess the value of follow-on tasking of reconnaissance and
surveillance assets. Accommodate real-time threat environment
intelligence and meteorological data and apply decision logic that
accounts for realistic operational conditions. Provide a system level
capability that manages false alarms while maintaining sufficient
network-wide sensitivity to the threat condition.\nPHASE II: Fabricate,
integrate, test, and optimize the performance of a signal processing
system that was defined as an outcome of the Phase I Feasibility
Study.\n\nPHASE III: A Phase III follow-on effort would effect a system
demonstration that could be integrated into a wargame environment or
table-top exercise to enable capability and doctrine developers to
assess the value of an autonomous layered sensing architecture on
battlefield situational understanding. The demonstration would have
immediate value for the definition of future warfighter capability
requirements while simultaneously maturing the technology readiness
level of the multimodal data fusion environment.\n\nPHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: An integrated multimodal data fusion environment would
realize significant market potential in industrial process control and
chemical transfer line integrity in engineering plants and medical
diagnostics. Environmental, law enforcement, security, and
incident\/disaster response applications would also lend themselves to
the exploitation of multimodal data fusion integration systems and

appropriate munition sub-system. The solution must be of such small size
 as to fit within the very limited volume claim (ideally within a 1
cubic inch volume) of the airframe and utilize existing power supply
(ideally less than one watt). Life expectancy of the technology shall be
 at least 20 years.\nPHASE I: Identify all gun launch environmental
effects and factors the projectile experiences. From these factors the
contractor shall formulate and laboratory verify the technologies that
are capable of accurately measuring the motion of the projectile during
and after gun launch. The contractor will perform and document design
analyses to demonstrate compliance with requirements listed above. The
results of Phase I will include an engineering analysis of alternatives
noting the design capabilities and limitations and recommendations for
the Phase II effort, as well as recommendations for the physical
prototypes to be built in the laboratory and subjected to laboratory
functional testing.\nPHASE II: Based on success in Phase I, the
contractor shall refine the selected design(s) to meet functional and
environmental requirements. The contractor will design and build a
minimum of 10 prototypes and provide to the government. At the
Government\u2019s discretion these prototypes may undergo air and\/or
rail gun testing culminating in a ballistic test (live fire).
Deliverables include the 10 prototypes, an engineering report on the
design selected in the contractor\u2019s format. PHASE III: The topic
author envisions that the LOS\/BLOS Division within ARDEC\u2019s
Munitions Engineering and Technology Center will incorporate and test
the developed technology in a time-fuzed munition. A need may exist to
provide analysis, instructions, process control documents, and design
that can be used by Army engineering to integrate the Phase II
technology into a selected munition for further performance evaluations.
 To this end, the contractor may be requested, if funds are available,
to design and build a minimum of 10 prototype sensor packages to be
integrated into an Army selected munition. This munition may undergo air
 and\/or rail gun testing culminating in a live-fire ballistics test.",

Evaluation Tool \/ System for Improved Power Systems",
        "description": "In order to develop new high-performance
batteries, fuel cells, and sensors, the electrochemical behavior of
materials and devices need to be quantitatively assessed. This
assessment (models and systems characterization) will help identify the
performance of electrochemical systems leading to the development of
significantly improved power sources. New electrochemical analysis tools
 will enable better characterization of electrodes, electrolytes, and
devices. Often only a few data points from a voltammogram or working
curves for each experimental condition are used to determine, the formal
 potential and peak current. These analyses can be imprecise due to
background currents, multiple redox processes, etc. Pulse voltammetry
not only reduces charging currents but can also be mathematically
described and modeled. To date a limited set of fundamental models have
been developed to describe the pulsed voltammetric response for complex
mechanisms and electrode geometries using the data contained in the
complete voltammogram. Additional models need to be developed and these
techniques made accessible to the research community using a generalized
 approach that can easily determine relevant electrochemical parameters
from datasets obtained by modern instrumentation. In particular, it is
not possible to determine the reversible half-wave potential, the charge
 transfer coefficient, the heterogeneous charge transfer rate, or the
diffusion coefficient from the entire voltammogram. A tool is needed
that is able to quantify electrochemical parameters using a variety of
pulse profiles and would enable enhanced understanding of the behavior
of redox couples and resultant devices such as batteries, fuel cells,
and electrochemical sensors. Furthermore, the algorithms must be able
translate between different types of instrumentation and new pulse based
 voltammetry techniques. These tools would be integrated into commercial
 electrochemistry data generation and analysis packages. PHASE I:
Develop models and measurement \/ characteristic tools that can
determine reversible half-wave potential, the charge transfer
coefficient, the heterogeneous charge transfer rate, and the diffusion
coefficient for single square wave voltammograms. The resultant tool
should allow the parameters to be calculated entirely from the
voltammograms (with user provided initial values) or allow individual
variables to be set by the user and the other variables calculated based
 on the voltammogram. In addition, the package should determine the
confidence\/uncertainty for the calculated electrochemical
parameters.\nPHASE II: Incorporate additional models to allow
utilization of data from a variety of pulse voltammetry techniques
including: normal pulse, reverse pulse, and differential pulse
voltammetry, as well as coupled electrochemical and chemical mechanisms
such as preceding chemical reaction, following chemical reaction,
catalytic chemical reaction, etc. The algorithm should also be capable
of determining the electrochemical parameters from a "bundled" series of
 voltammograms with for example varying square wave frequency. Verify
with statistical confidence intervals the accuracy of the data obtained.
 Integrate the models and evaluation tools into commercial
electrochemistry data generation and analysis package that will assist
in determining prospective solutions performance. PHASE III: This
product would be used in a broad range of military and civilian research

environments where obstacles, particularly wires or power lines exist,
and pilot vision is degraded by obscurants such as dust, smoke, fog,
rain and snow. This SBIR would focus on a radar solution to detecting
wires and power cables when landing in a visually degraded environment.
Existing data for wires and power lines with millimeter wave radars
produce either curtains or periodic bright spots through the bragg
effect when used in traditional real beam imaging. However, if the
sensor is capable of penetrating an obscurant and has an automated
technique to recognize a power line or wire, the sensor can simply send
data to an independent imager to nominally represent a wire without the
need to image it. The development of a technique or algorithm to
recognize wires at a variety of approach angles will improve the
Army\u2019s capability of operation in degraded visual
environments.\nPHASE I: Phase I will investigate an approach to
recognizing wires, including wires from 3\/8\u201d up to bundled high
power transmission lines, from angles of incidence of 0 degrees (head on
 from the sensor) to 45 degrees angle of incidence from the sensor. The
techniques proposed will utilize previously collected fully calibrated
government furnished sensor data in the millimeter wave radar regime (W
band).\nPHASE II: Phase II will further develop and refine techniques or
 algorithms \/software to demonstrate the ability to detect and identify
 wires using the approaches laid out in Phase I. The laboratory
demonstration will include formatted and calibrated W government
supplied data with approaches to wires from a range of angles of
incidence. The Phase II effort shall be capable of detecting bundled
high power transmission lines (threshold) down to 3\/8\u201d smaller
wires (objective), from angles of incidence of 0-20 degrees (threshold)
and up to 45 degrees (objective) from detection ranges of 150 meters
(threshold) out to 2 kilometers (objective). PHASE III: Phase III will
build on the laboratory demonstration from Phase II to include
integration with a W band radar sensor and a synthetic vision system to
provide a full detection and visualization system for pilot situational
awareness on rotary wing aircraft. The proposers will also consider
other military applications including applications to fixed wing and UAV
 operations to enhance capabilities in degraded visual environments.
Commercially, this capability enhancement can transition to the
commercial aircraft industry for passenger airlines as well as the
shipping industry. The end state system will also increase aircraft
survivability for both private industry first responders and emergency
medivac helicopter transports, as well as military pararescue aircraft
in urban areas where wires may impact helicopter survivability. The end
state system is directly applicable to sensor fusion efforts in the
RDECOM Degraded Visual Environment Mitigation Program and can transition
 to PM Aviation. The technology, as it matures, can also transition to
meeting the needs of Future Vertical Lift expected capabilities

        "topic_name": "Cortical Modem Systems Integration and
Packaging",
        "description": "The DoD has a critical need for breakthrough
medical therapies to treat wounded warriors with multiple comorbidities
of sensory organs. This topic seeks to integrate state-of-the-art
electronics, packaging, and passivation technologies with the latest
low-power data and power delivery semiconductor components in a single
package. In other words, DARPA seeks to wirelessly bridge cortical
neural activity sensing components within the skull to external
computing and network systems, designing an effective \u201cCortical
Modem\u201d that connects human brains to computer equipment and
networks in a direct analogy to early telephonic modems, which connected
 computers to the ARPANET.\nDARPA is open to a multiplicity of system
architectures that, first and foremost, demonstrate significant
improvements in the scale of neural channel bandwidth from the current
100-signal demonstrations, but secondly, may span a wide spectrum of
implementation strategies from high-bandwidth transmission systems with
limited implantable computation capability, to implantable integrated
analysis and compression systems coupled to a limited bandwidth
telemetry systems.\nSignificant advances in the miniaturization and ever
 lower-power performance of electronic and photonic technologies have
enabled critical developments in miniaturized communications products
like cellular phones. However, the time lag between such advances and
their adoption in the fields of neuroscience and neuro-engineering has,
in many cases, grown to more than twenty years. With such large
interface component feature sizes characteristic of the older
technologies in common experimental use, the supporting interface
electronics have now become one of the most significant and fundamental
limits to their integration within human and animal bodies. For example,
 the Utah array features a 400 micrometer electrode pitch, a limitation
compounded by the wet etch microfabrication technology available to the
manufacturer. Note that this 400 micron feature size is representative
of 1980s CMOS technologies, and is too coarse for interfacing with, for
example, the visual cortex where neural pitch ranges from ten to thirty
microns. As the mobile computing industry continues to push
miniaturization, functionality, and power-consumption requirements to
their limits, so too is the field of neuroscience pushing ever closer to
 full-duplex single-neuron scale interfaces. With focused technology
development and integration to build a Cortical Modem, the necessary
critical electronics and packaging could be leveraged across the entire
academic and corporate neuroscience ecosystem to result in dramatically
accelerated advances in science and commercialization of neuroscience
technologies.\nThe goal of this topic is to develop cortical modem
components that substantially improve the scale of signal transduction
from the current 10x10 electronic probe arrays, as well as the scale of
telemetry delivery of those signals., For reference purposes, one mm^3
volume of cortical tissue encloses approximately 100,000 neurons
indicating an eventual need to both transduce and deliver wireless
telemetry for as many as 10^7 independent neural channels. Proposals
should target the design and implementation of a COTS-based full duplex
cortical interface component. Essential elements of this component
include flexible direct electronic interfaces to neural activity,
sensors and low power pre-processing circuitry to convert and encode
neural sensor signals into formats that can be transmitted wirelessly
across the skull, wireless telemetry suitable for safe use in humans,
and power delivery electronics. Packaging must leverage state-of-the-art
 miniaturized single system-on-a-chip ceramic packaging that
incorporates on-board wireless power reception and conditioning
circuitry.\nCritical to the design of the system is a careful power and
link budget analysis to account for relevant FDA and FCC regulations. In
 addition, proposals should detail the intended components (i.e. make,
model, and part numbers), their interface design, and the technical and
mechanical specifications that will ultimately yield the lowest power,
smallest form-factor, highest signal-to-noise ratio and bandwidth system
 possible using COTS components. Critical systems integration challenges
 must be addressed explicitly in the proposal. Technical challenges and
considerations include system power, transmission bandwidth, frequency
and data rates, transmission protocols, optical wavelengths, etc.
Offerors are to first uncover and understand the critical integration
challenges that may limit the translation and commercial-viability of
full-duplex cortical interfaces, and second to push the standards of
integration by producing a first generation of truly miniaturized and
implantable interface componentry, thereby accelerating innovation
across the entire field of neuro-engineering.\nIndustrial and military
collaborators should then produce products and reach their first
commercialization milestones on a similarly accelerated timeline.
Technical challenges may include:\n\u2022 The development of a standard
interface between a multiplicity of different neural sensing components
and the data collection and transmission system.\n\u2022 Maximizing the
scalability and bandwidth-power product of both the internal neural
sensing and external wireless data and power interfaces, but doing so
within safe heat dissipation limits of the outer cortex and
skull.\n\u2022 The potential need for data translation and encoding
components to minimize power requirements for transcranial data and
power delivery.\n\u2022 Establishing optimal trade-offs between
physical, electronic, and data transmission specifications required to
minimize the componentry bill of materials (BoM) and hence the size of
the device that needs to be implanted.\n\u2022 Sourcing state-of-the-art
 packaging and system-on-a-chip prototyping support\n\u2022 Determining
optimal bio-material passivation strategies and packaging materials
limitations.\n\u2022 Determining optimal power-bandwidth tradeoffs and
scalability to support increasing sensory density, resolution, and
sensitivity limitations.\nPHASE I: Explore and determine the fundamental
 systems integration and packaging limitations (that are common across
the entire neural interface field) in implementing a full-duplex
read\/write neural interface system that bridges data and power delivery
 across the human skull.\nPhase I deliverables: 1) Final Report that
identifies the neural read\/write signals modalities (not necessarily
required to be the same); details the technical challenges relevant to
the read and write signals within the deployment environment; quantifies
 the information limits to the system relative to the information
input\/output of the cortical area of interest; details component-level
metrics for coping with the data and power requirements; describes
integration process, system-level challenges; and a thorough business
plan describing the NRE costs, minimum rate of production, units per
year required to achieve sustainable production of a cortical modem, and
 market analysis; 2) Develop a fully-operational proof-of-concept
demonstration of the key components and functional systems in a
bench-top \/ PC-board scaled prototype along with all the design
documents and complete specifications, along with documentation of
committed sources and service providers for the fabrication of the
ultimate integrated system-on-a-chip Cortical Modem device to be
produced in Phase II; full specifications and a complete BoM are
required, itemizing each component and system that comprises the final
prototype system. These demonstrations should be performed in relevant
in vitro environments analogous to the final deployment environment in
the human skull and cortex.\nPHASE II: Development, demonstration, and
delivery of a working fully-integrated cortical modem at a 1:1 physical
scale with the underlying neurons. The Phase II demonstration should
operate within a physical simulacrum that mimics as closely as possible
the electrical and mechanical properties of human cortex, skull, and
scalp. The integrated system should leverage COTS silicon and
electro-optical devices wherever possible, and form a data and power
bridge between the internal cortex and external machines. On the cortex
side, a modular neural interface architecture should support
bi-directional communications through a multiplicity of neural probe
modalities, including, but not limited to, optical, electronic, and
bio-molecular sensing interfaces. The external interface should be
comprised of a wireless interconnection through intervening brain and
skull tissue to external computing systems.\nProposers are encouraged to
 adapt modular componentry strategies that are generalizable to a wide
range of neural interfaces. The Cortical Modem system should be able to
collect and transmit neural signals through the skull in a complete,
implantable package. It will have a form-factor and packaging that can
be implanted in the cortex with core system functionality provided by
COTS semiconductor components in a single ceramic system-on-a-chip
package, rather than a fully-customized chipset.\nThe Phase II final
report shall include (1) full system design and specifications detailing
 the electronics and proof-of-concept neural interfaces to be
integrated; (2) expected performance specifications of the proposed
components in vivo; and (3) calculations of energy and link budget
scalability to larger cortical regions.\nPHASE III: Breakthrough medical
 treatments for wounded warriors with multiple comorbidities of the
sensory organs. Effective restoration sight, sound, smell, and
vestibular sensation after massive head trauma. Breakthrough medical
treatments for upper spinal cord injuries, enabling restoration of motor
 and sensory capability. Breakthrough medical treatments for diseases of
 sensory organs, providing sight and sound to treat indications not
possible through use of current retinal prostheses and cochlear
implants.",

that hunt or feed on other animals. They are characterized by keen
vision that allows them to detect prey during flight. Since vision is
the most important sense for birds, and good eyesight is essential for
safe flight, this group has a number of adaptations which give visual
acuity superior to that of other vertebrate groups. The objective of
this SBIR is to develop an innovative solution which will allow the
operator to achieve the same sort of superior imaging and improved
situational awareness available to avian predators. The effective focal
length (EFL) of the imaging system itself should be able to change;
simple digital magnification of an image does not provide the kind of
image clarity discussed here. While variable focal length lenses have
been demonstrated (see references), shortcomings have been identified
both in the range of the EFL shift and in the resolution capabilities of
 the system. The intent of this effort is to push the boundaries of this
 technology and achieve extreme shift and resolution. This EFL shift
should be maximized, with a minimum EFL of no more than 40mm, and a
dynamic shift of 10x (threshold), 100x (objective). Time for EFL shift
will be considered; while there is no rigid time requirement, the lens
must be able to shift across it''s full dynamic range quickly (80% at
1000m. False alarms are to be minimized as much as possible. Image
processing must be conducted on a man-portable computer system (laptop
or smaller). Once detected, range to the target must be determined.
Range is to be accurate to +\/- 1m within 1000m. While passive range
finding via computer vision (see reference) is preferred, active range
finding (to include laser range finding) is permitted, however the
ranging must be done automatically (i.e., the operator isn''t tasked
with aiming a laser, the system instead aims and range-finds for the
operator). PHASE I: Investigate innovative optical solutions for imaging
 systems. Develop and document the overall optic component design and
accompanying algorithms for operation\/alteration of the lensing system.
 Develop support documentation for the lensing medium. Demonstrate a
proof of principle of the design by producing a preliminary architecture
 concept (for example, lens size, sensor size\/density) where image
acquisition information can be displayed and analyzed with a computer
system. Phase I deliverables will include: Monthly status reports, Final
 phase report, and demonstration hardware.\nPHASE II: Develop and
demonstrate a prototype capability for insertion into a realistic,
Government-supplied imaging system. The component must be capable of
demonstrating key operational parameters (in particular alteration of
EFL) in a laboratory environment. Include analytical studies and
laboratory studies to physically validate the analytical predictions of
separate elements of the technology. Identify representative components
that are not yet integrated. Demonstrate ability to automatically locate
 and track a target within the imager\u2019s field of view. Demonstrate
the ability to accurately determine range to that target. Phase II
deliverables will include: Monthly status reports, Final phase report,
and prototype system (TRL 5\/6) demonstrating functionality of lens,
target detection, and rangefinding.\nPHASE III: Protoype system
validation in a realistic (outdoor, controlled range) environment.
Components are integrated into a meaningful form factor, and in a
package which is robust enough for Soldier use. System size, weight, and
 power will be optimized for functionality and reliability.
Manufacturability assessment will be conducted. Intent for this
technology is to transition to the Fire Control family of systems,
particularly the Fire Control-Squad and Fire Control-Precision Programs
of Record (POR\u2019s). Commercial opportunities (to be defined by

        "topic_name": "Broadband Self-calibrated Rydberg-based RF
Electric Field and Power Sensor",
        "description": "There is a critical need for capabilities that
will enable the DoD to have self-calibrated electric field and power
sensors in the RF, microwave, and millimeter-wavelength regimes. This
topic seeks the demonstration of a portable broadband (1 GHz \u2013 1
THz) electric field, power sensor, or key components towards a device.
The sensor should be capable of operating in greater than 1 kV\/m
electric fields as to be usable for high-energy DoD applications. The
electric field and power measurements must be SI traceable to remove the
 need for the recalibration process. Furthermore, the electric
field-sensing device should be capable of sub-wavelength imaging of RF
electric fields with spatial resolutions exceeding 10 \u03bcm. Many DoD
and commercial applications critically rely on using calibrated electric
 field and power sensors in the RF, microwave, and millimeter-wavelength
 regimes. Currently no self-calibrated sensor exists in the 100 GHz
\u2013 1 THz frequency band. Typical detectors in the sub-THz frequency
range are antennas which inherently perturb the field they are trying to
 sense, resulting in greater than 5% measurement errors.\nAntennas have
the further limitation that they are narrow-band detectors. A
SI-traceable sensor in the 1 GHz \u2013 1 THz range would remove the
need for costly recalibration of older devices and would replace many
narrow-band antennas with a single low-SWaP device in a handheld
package. Quantum sensors based upon Rydberg atoms offer the potential of
 traceable calibration, high sensitivity, wide spectral coverage, and
high power capability.\nIn addition to DoD applications, a Rydberg field
 and power sensor would have numerous commercial applications: circuit
design [1, 2], biological sensing [3], aeronautics applications [4], and
 mobile communication [5]. This technology would not only verify circuit
 design but inform it by employing sub-wavelength RF field imaging of
the complicated electronic fields from various dense circuits and
metamaterials [1, 2]. Current technology employing electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT) in Rydberg atoms in an atomic vapor cell is a
 promising route but requires further development in order to achieve
DoD functionality. These devices function by converting an electric
field amplitude into a measurable frequency splitting [6] that is
SI-traceable [7]. The electric field magnitude E is given by
|E|=\u210f\u0394f\/P, where \u210f is Planck\u2019s constant divided by
2\u03c0, \u0394f is the measured frequency splitting, and P is the
transition dipole moment. Current work has demonstrated sensitivities of
 3 \u03bcV\/sqrt(Hz) measuring electric fields as low as 7.3 \u03bcV\/cm
 [8] and up to 40 V\/m [9] in a 1-130 GHz frequency range. These results
 are the first calibrated field measurements in the 100 GHz \u2013 1 THz
 frequency band to date. Employing this technique to image RF electric
fields resulted in sub-100 \u03bcm spatial resolutions [1] for electric
fields with frequencies up to 104 GHz [2, 10].\nThe fabrication of
micrometer-sized vapor cells is one of the more challenging
technological developments necessary for these sensors. The size of
these vapor cells must be reduced to at least one quarter of the length
of the minimum wavelength of interest in order to prevent variations in
the measured RF fields produced by standing waves. These cells must be
all dielectric, made of quartz or Pyrex for example, and must be filled
with alkali atoms such as Rb and Cs or a mixture of atomic species. The
fabrication of micrometer-sized vapor cells suffers from atomic
adsorption to the cell walls. These vapor cells must employ a mitigation
 technique for the reduced vapor pressure such as novel coatings or
materials, bonded infrared absorption glass to the outside of the cell
for IR heating or optical coupling mirrors bonded to the cell to form
optical resonators for enhanced atom-light interaction. Such vapor cell
production would not only benefit electric field sensing but atomic
vapor-based magnetometry. Atomic vapor magnetometry currently provides
the most sensitive magnetic field measurements [11] but it does not have
 high spatial resolution because it is limited to integration over the
vapor cell length. Commercially available micrometer-sized atomic vapor
cells would allow for the extension of atom-based magnetometry into a
different spatial resolution regime [12, 13].\nPHASE I: Demonstrate the
operation of key components towards the electric field or power sensor
in a laboratory setting such as: broadband measurements (100-250 GHz),
electric field sensitivities better than 100 \u03bcV\/cm, circuitry
imaging with better than 50 \u03bcm spatial resolution, or fabrication
of an alkali vapor cell with sub-mm length scales, and the development
of a technique to mitigate reduced vapor pressures. Phase I deliverables

 and design concepts to extend the measurement space to 1 GHz - 1 THz,
improve the spatial resolution, and detail an experimental method to use
 the device in a high electric field environment (greater than 1
kV\/m).\nPHASE II: Construct and demonstrate a breadboard system with a
path towards a portable device. If the performer is developing
components, fabricate the miniaturized alkali vapor cell to less than a
100 \u03bcm length.\nPhase II deliverables: 1) a demonstration in a
simulated or relevant environment achieving broadband measurement (1 GHz
 \u2013 1 THz), detection of less than 1 \u03bcV\/cm electric fields,
and sub-wavelength imaging with better than 10 \u03bcm spatial
resolution. 2) a final report that documents the results of the
demonstration and specifications of the fabricated alkali vapor cell 3)
Completed designs for a portable prototype. This phase is expected to
reach TRL 5.\nPHASE III: If successful this technology could transition
to multiple DoD offices and could eventually replace current 1 GHz
\u2013 1 THz based electric field and power sensors, removing the need
for recalibration against standards. This device could also be
commercially viable to examine densely packed microwave circuit designs
imaging the electric fields with sub-100 \u03bcm resolution to strongly
inform and guide circuit design. Development of the micrometer-sized
alkali-based vapor cells would be commercially usable for atomic
vapor-based magnetometry opening new realms of spatial resolution for
the highest magnetic field sensitive magnetometers. Such vapor cells
could also have potential use in the timing community.",

Programming Frameworks",
        "description": "Today there is a DoD need for graph analytics
capabilities, which are critical for a large range of application
domains with a vital impact on both national security and the national
economy, including, among others: counter-terrorism; fraud detection;
drug discovery; cyber-security; social media; logistics and supply
chains; e-commerce, etc. Widely used graph development frameworks have
enabled online (but not real-time) graph analytics for broad classes of
problems at a modest data scales and support only offline analytics for
very large data scales. The Facebook graph today has over 1 Trillion
edges. A single iteration of a graph traversal takes up to 3 minutes
using Apache Giraph on 200 commodity CPU servers. A full breadth first
traversal of the graph could take nearly 20 minutes, and algorithms that
 relax to a solution can require 50-100 iterations, implying that it
could take several hours to compute the Page Rank of the Facebook
graph.\nBringing analytics within these graph programming frameworks
into real-time on large graphs requires that they be able to leverage
the computing advances in multi-core platforms. However, scalable,
data-parallel graph analytics on many-core hardware is a fundamentally
hard problem that goes well beyond the current state of the art. Graph
data models and algorithms are used for network structured data, when
the data are poorly structured, or when complex relationships must be
drawn from multiple data sets and analyzed together. Graph operations
are inherently non-local and, for many real-world data sets, that
non-locality is aggravated by extreme data skew.\nGraph analytics are
data intensive rather than compute intensive which means that memory and
 network bandwidth are the bottlenecks for graph processing. Overall,
current solutions applied to scaling graph frameworks such as Tinkerpop
and Graphlab do not have all of the desired attributes integrated,
specifically 1) Solutions based on map\/reduce or requiring checkpoints
to disk are 1000s of times too slow to extract the value latent in
graphs for time-sensitive analytics. (2) Solutions based on
non-updatable data representations are limited in their application to
complex analytics. 3) Solutions that provide robust scaling and high
performance require specialized programming techniques that are not
easily accessible to the existing graph development community.
Approaches leveraging multi-core technology have significant promise. At
 the purely hardware level, GPU memory bandwidth is set to jump by 4x by
 Q1 2016 (Pascal). This should provide a 4x speedup. Thus going from 10x
 - 100x speedups over CPUs to 40x - 400x over CPUs.\nPHASE I: Develop
innovative approaches to apply many-core GPU and\/or hybrid CPU
technologies to existing graph development APIs. The focus should be on
framework fidelity, computational scalability, and easing the burden of
integration. In addition, develop detailed analysis of predicted
performance of the proposed approach and plans for developing the
approach into a comprehensive platform to accelerate a graph framework
in Phase II. The Phase I deliverable is a final report documenting the
effort and results.\nPHASE II: Develop a comprehensive implementation of
 an existing graph framework accelerated for commodity high performance
many-core (GPUs) and multi-core CPUs technologies using the approaches
identified in Phase I. Develop a prototype and establish a preliminary
benchmark using various standard problems, and apply the tool to a DoD
relevant problem. Phase II deliverables will include software, a final
report documenting the effort, a document describing the architecture
and a user\u2019s manual.\nPHASE III: Real time data ingest and
reasoning analytics for military situational awareness platforms.
Commercial uses of the accelerated graph framework include a 1000-10000X
 acceleration of existing graph analytics such as Facebook\u2019s
current graph traversal.",

impact injury prevention technologies address the challenge to provide
warfighter survivability, allowing them to complete their mission, by
preventing impact related injuries such as skull fractures and neck
injuries, otherwise incurred during underbody blast, crash and rollover
events. The solution accounts for the full range of occupants to include
 the 5th female, 50th male, and 95th male occupant sizes. Additionally
it takes into account the occupant may be wearing the ACH helmet and
additional gear worn on the body of the occupant. The occupant shall be
considered restrained during the blast event. Injury data from theater
shows mounted warfighter head, neck and upper spine injuries due to
occupant impacts with the vehicle interior during blast, crash and
rollover events, frequently occur (Head Injury Analysis for DOT &amp; E
Study, JTAPIC RFI 2013-N0114, 10APR2013 and 2012-N0161 Blast Injury
Prevalence Rate BIPSR, 10JAN2013). Injuries to the head include
traumatic brain injuries (TBI) primarily concussions, skull fractures,
face fractures and neck\/upper spine fractures. The focus of this topic
is to reduce injuries related to skull and neck fractures. Traumatic
brain injuries are out of scope of this topic. Although it can be
assumed that if impact energy is mitigated to reduced fractures,
TBI\u2019s related to occupant impacts is also likely to be reduced.

velocity of 15 miles per hour (24 kilometers per hour). The energy
attenuation criterion for head impact protection, will achieve less than
 700 HICd (Head Injury Criterion) using the test evaluation method and
equipment per FMVSS 201U. HICd is calculated in accordance with the
following formula taken from JSSG-2010-7 Crew Systems Crash Protection

Acceleration magnitude in g units at the dummy head cg. t1 and t2 are
any two points in time during the impact event which are separated by
not more than a 15 millisecond time (FMVSS 49 CFR 571 208: Occupant
Crash Protection, 2013.10.01). Neck impact injury protection shall be
designed according to SAE J885, Feb 2011-02, section related to Direct
Impact to the Neck and Neck injury due to head inertia loading. Neck
impact injury protection shall provide a maximum peak flexion bending
moment about the occipital condyle shall not exceed 190 Nm. The maximum
peak extension bending moment about the occipital condyle shall not
exceed 57 Nm. The maximum peak axial tension shall not exceed 3300N. The
 maximum peak axial compression shall not exceed 4000 Newtons. The
maximum peak fore and aft shear shall not exceed 3100 Newtons. The neck
moments are calculated form the following formula: MOCY =MY \u2013
FX(0.01778m), where: MOCY = moment y about occipital condyle MY =
measured moment from load cell FX = measured force from load cell
Durability criterion is to not degrade in performance when exposed to
temperatures of MIL-STD-810 Basic Hot and Basic Cold Storage
temperatures, humidity and tracked vehicle vibration schedules. The
technology concept shall be developed with the intent to not incur holes
 from abrasion, tear or puncture after being tested to ASTM D2582, ASTM
D751, ASTM D2261, ASTM D3384, ASTM 966 or ASTM D1242 or similar
standard, based upon the exposed surface sheet material composition, at
1,000 cycles. The technology concept shall be developed with an exposed
surface designed to prevent an overhead dripping and melting injuring
the occupant, and shall not generate significant heat index, rapid
flashing (ignition greater than 15 seconds) or flame spread, smoke or

timing shall be included in the study.\nPHASE II: Phase II of this
effort shall focus upon the validation and correlation of the analytical
 concepts and pulses developed from Phase I, along with technology
prototype fabrication and validation laboratory testing and evaluation.
Military vehicle application(s) and integration concepts will be further
 refined for one or more military vehicle, such as the the HMMWV (High
Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle, AMPV (Armored Multiple Purpose
Vehicle), Abrams, Bradley Fighting Vehicle, Stryker, 20 T Truck and HTV

purposes of laboratory verification and vehicle interface evaluation.
The energy attenuation performance of the technology solution(s) for
head-neck impact injury protection shall be in accordance with the
criterion in Phase I, and shall be verified during Phase II. Laboratory

Systems",
        "description": "There is a critical DoD need for capabilities
that focus on temperature stabilization of MEMS inertial sensors to
improve bias and scale factor stability. Military operations rely on
satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) for precision
Positioning, Navigation &amp; Timing (PNT) information. However, GPS is
an extremely small signal, which may be degraded due to signal
interference or obstructed by environmental factors such as clouds,
urban canyons or other impeding structures [1]. In GPS-degraded
environments critical PNT information must be gathered from alternate
sources, such as navigation by the technique of dead reckoning based on
acceleration and rotation inputs from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
 [2]. IMUs based on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) are low
Cost, Size, Weight, and Power (CSWaP), but typically exhibit high
calibration environmental sensitivity, particularly to external
temperature variation [3,4]. MEMS sensors are early in their
development; they have made their way into consumer market but
underlying limits to sensitivity and stability are not well understood.
This is analogous to the development of crystal oscillators (XO)
developed early in the 20th century.\nOver the past century, temperature
 sensitivity of crystal oscillators has been improved by applying
temperature compensation algorithms based on the externally sensed
ambient temperature (TCXO) [5]. However, the best performing crystal
oscillators rely on ovenization of the resonant device to provide the
highest stability (OCXO)[6]. The evolution of MEMS-based inertial
sensors is likely to follow a similar trajectory due to the similarity
of vibrating MEMS devices to quartz oscillators. At present,
uncompensated MEMS inertial sensors are widely available for commercial
applications and digital temperature compensation (TC-MEMS) devices are
emerging [7]. Temperature stabilization has been demonstrated to improve
 long-term stability and reproducibility of MEMS inertial sensors in an
academic setting but has yet to be transitioned into marketable
MEMS-based inertial sensors [8]. This SBIR seeks to develop Ovenized
Inertial MEMS (OI-MEMS) with a viable path to commercialization.\nPHASE
I: Design a concept for achieving tactical grade inertial sensor
performance, as listed below. The sensor should operate on 500mW in a
0.5cc package. Phase I deliverables will include: a fabrication flow

Accelerometer: .5 ft\/s\/rt(hr)\nPHASE II: Develop, demonstrate, and
validate Phase 1 model predictions; refine fabrication procedures to
fine tune thermal expansion and coefficient second-order effects;
conduct life cycle and environmental testing to verify performance;
manufacture and deliver gyroscope or accelerometer prototypes for
government evaluation. Required Phase II deliverables include 5 packaged
 sensors with necessary electronics to operate the Ovenized Inertial
MEMS device.\nPHASE III: The military need for PNT information in the
absence of GPS is in very high demand. Current DARPA programs are
pursuing self-contained navigation for applications such as missile
guidance, mounted and dismounted soldier navigation in GPS denied
environments. Much progress has been made in existing microPNT programs.
 This SBIR will complement those efforts, by addressing the key driver
of long-term instability with a fast track to commercialization. Due to
the high performance of the OI-MEMS, there is limited commercial
application. However, there is a market for high performance, small
CSWaP inertial sensors for oil drilling and agricultural applications.",

metal matrix composites. All of these are expensive and hard to process.
 This effort focuses on developing a composite system which is low cost
and can be processed at low temperatures while still having a high-use
temperature. The processing temperature must be low enough so as to not
cause coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch issues with steel
substrates. PHASE I: Develop a composite material system that
demonstrates low cost, low processing temperature and high-use
temperature. Demonstrate its capabilities by producing mechanical test
results across the entire temperature range of interest. ASTM D3039

Hyperspectral Imaging System",
        "description": "There is a compelling DoD need to create a low
cost, compact and reconfigurable infrared imaging spectrometer that can
operate in real time, and in a variety of backgrounds and ambient
conditions. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems have been fielded for
the detection of hazardous chemical and explosives threat materials, tag
 detection, friend vs. foe detection (IFF) and other defense critical
sensing missions. Such systems currently exist in airborne and ground
sensing configurations in short-wave, mid-wave and long-wave infrared
(IR) spectral regions. They are based on HSI sensor hardware
architectures combined with multivariate analysis algorithms [1,2].
While these imaging systems can provide sensitive and specific
detections of targets and identification of materials in complex
backgrounds, they are typically large, costly to field, operate, and
support, and generally do not operate in real-time. Those systems that
operate in real time typically compromise some degree of freedom, such
as the number of spectral bands, image definition, or number of targets
being detected. Reconfiguring the system to an alternative set of
targets or backgrounds requires significant effort, which makes
adjusting to dynamic mission conditions impractical. Nonetheless,
intelligence based on HSI systems has proven very useful, resulting in
an increasing demand for it; but due to the high cost of procuring and
maintaining an HSI system, they are only available to privileged
users.\nSpecifically, what is needed is an IR hyperspectral imaging and
sensing capability with the following characteristics: (1) rapidly
field-configurable operation to adapt to different targets or operating
conditions; (2) real-time, target on-the-move operation, ideally at the
frame rate of the focal plane array camera; (3) real-time automated
target signature detection, performed within the system to dramatically
reduce data bandwidth, downlink transmission bandwidth requirements, and
 post-processing; (4) significantly reduced cost, size, and weight; and
(5) imaging operation with minimal support infrastructure. The resulting
 system should be able to support one or more of the following missions:
 counter IED detection, IFF, bio\/chemical WMD detection and tag, track
and locate (TTL) missions.\nThe performance goals of such a system
are:\n\u2022 Frame rate 10 frame per second (fps) or greater\n\u2022
Free spectral range covering at least one band of 850-1700 nm for SWIR,
3-5\u03bcm for MWIR, 8-11+\u03bcm for LWIR\n\u2022 Form factor, suitable
 for operation as a handheld, wearable or UAV-mounted
configuration\n\u2022 Weight less than 5 lbs.\n\u2022 Run time greater
than 4 hours, with power source included in weight metric\n\u2022 Cost
of less than $50,000 in volume of 1000 or more\n\u2022 High Definition
Chemical Image - Megapixel (1Kx1K) or greater\n\u2022 Low latency of
less than or equal to 100ms\n\u2022 Interface compatible with XML
schema\n\u2022 Autonomously link to existing military architecture or
infrastructure (e.g., cell phone).\nIn summary, a Compact,
Mission-Configurable, on-Demand, Real-Time, Infrared Hyperspectral
Imaging Sensor is envisioned. It is acknowledged that all spectral
ranges may not be accommodated in a single sensor, and that the
objective vision may not be fully realizable during the course of a
Phase II SBIR. However, concrete and compelling hardware\/software
progress towards this vision is expected to be demonstrated.\nPHASE I:
Design a concept for an infrared hyperspectral imaging system capable of
 real-time, and multi-mission configurable-on-demand operation with
specific performance objectives as described. Develop an analysis of
predicted performance, and define key component technological
milestones. Establish performance goals in terms of parameters such as
time of operation; probability of detection and false alarm; detection
time; spectral range; image quality; field of view; day, night and
obscured condition visualization; image frame rate; and size, weight and
 power (SWaP). In addition, provide a contrast with existing
hyperspectral imaging systems. Produce an initial mockup, possibly using
 3D printed parts and\/or solid models, showing the system form factor
at the preliminary design level.\nPhase I deliverables would
include:\n\u2022 A description of the system design and functions mapped
 to real-time imaging system requirements,\n\u2022 A performance
assessment against existing approaches,\n\u2022 An evaluation of key
tradeoffs, and\n\u2022 A risk reduction and demonstration plan.\n\u2022
Final report\/phase II proposal\nPHASE II: Develop and demonstrate a
prototype real-time mission-configurable infrared hyperspectral imaging
sensor system with the specified features, including on board detection,
 and operation at 10 fps or higher sampling rate. Construct and
demonstrate the operation of a laboratory prototype, which would have
the core features needed to achieve mission configurability
capabilities. Exercise relevant software functions and exposure to
different mission conditions, including demonstration of ability to
change system detection configurations against multiple different target
 sets through rapid field configuration. Perform additional analyses as
needed to project eventual performance capabilities.\nPhase II
deliverables would include:\n\u2022 A final design with all drawings,
simulations and modeling results;\n\u2022 One prototype of the real-time
 chemical imaging system; \u2022 Software applications as
needed;\n\u2022 Performance data compared with performance and
environmental goals; and\n\u2022 Schedule with financial data for
program execution.\n\u2022 Preliminary and critical design
reviews\n\u2022 Monthly reports\nPHASE III: As described above, the
military utility of the data and intelligence that is generated by the
current large and costly systems has been demonstrated. Driving the SWaP
 and cost down such that the system can be used by a dismount or on a
small UAV will enable proliferation of the capability in the same way
that night vision goggles or cell phones have become an integral part of
 the soldier\u2019s arsenal. Requiring the system to be compatible with
existing systems and data formats will help ensure more rapid acceptance
 and use. Commercial application of hyperspectral imaging has been
increasing in parallel to military applications. These include
agriculture, mining, medical imaging and diagnoses, environmental
management, disaster management and hazard assessment. Like military
applications, the cost and size of these systems limits their
availability to all but the most privileged users. Driving the system
cost and SWaP down would enable proliferation of these devices to a
potentially large user base, including municipalities (police, fire,
etc.), agriculture (farmers, land managers, etc.), and healthcare
(health screening and microbiology).",

Flux Channel Antennas",
        "description": "Significant advances have been made recently in
the development of magnetic antennas. These antennas are magnetic duals
of electric antennas, which allow them to be mounted directly on an
aircraft surface. No frequency-dependent backing-cavities are required,
which allows true frequency-independent operations. Flux channels in the
 form of magnetic rings have been shown to replace vertical elements and
 crossed-linear dipoles. In both cases, no hull penetrations are
required save for the feed points, and the external presentation is
minimized. However, application to the curved surfaces of aircraft has
yet to be addressed. Issues involved are related to the tape-winding
process that has been used to manufacture the channels. This process
resists conforming to curved surfaces. Designs are required that can be
applied to singly and doubly curved surfaces such as those found on
aircraft. There is also opportunity here to arrange the geometries to
adjust antenna pattern characteristics. The solutions will need to
operate over a decade of frequency in the 3 \u2013 600 MHz (MegaHertz)
band with frequency-independent characteristics in both impedance and
radiation pattern. The antenna should attain a gain greater than 0 dBi
and a Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) equal to or better than 2.5:1
over at least the upper two octaves of the band. The design should be
extendable to other and wider frequency bands for both line-of-sight and
 satellite communications applications. The primary objective of this
solicitation is to extend the capabilities of magnetic-current radiators
 by constructing frequency-independent geometries. A secondary objective
 is to consider electrically small antennas and high-power antennas.
Using the science and current development state are described by
Sebastian in the references [1, 2].\n\nPHASE I: Determine technical
feasibility and develop an approach for frequency-independent geometries
 for magnetic flux-channel antennas that are conformal to aircraft
surfaces and designed to meet the performance requirements in the
description section. Prove feasibility through analysis and
simulation.\n\nPHASE II: Further develop design from Phase I through
additional analysis and simulation. Design, manufacture, integrate, and
demonstrate the operation of a prototype on a simulated aircraft body to
 establish practical performance parameters. Based on these results,
propose any refinements to the antenna design and fabrication approach
and determine the trade-off between cost, weight, and gain-bandwidth
performance. Address fabrication cost and volume challenges that are
relevant to the general application to aircraft.\n\nPHASE III: Finalize
the design from Phase II, perform relevant testing and transition the
technology to appropriate Navy and commercial platforms. The small
business will support the Navy with certifying and qualifying the
antenna for Naval use. As appropriate, the small business will focus on
scaling up manufacturing capabilities and commercialization plans.",

emerging commercial entrepreneurial and defense technologies enabling
lightweight, high-specific-energy liquid-rocket technology. Many

developing new rocket stage technologies that promise to reduce the cost
 of access to space. The goal of this topic is to leverage these
investments to enable low-cost launch vehicles that minimize gross and
dry weight while maximizing the propellant load, engine specific impulse
 and\/or payload. Technological trends facilitating such lightweight
stages include an ongoing computer\/software revolution enabling
affordable design, sophisticated software in lieu of mechanical
complexity, integration, and test; micro-miniaturization of electronics
and mechanical actuators; high strength-to-weight composites and
nano-engineered materials; lightweight structural concepts and thermal
protection; advanced manufacturing methods, high thrust\/weight rocket
engines and turbo-machinery; and novel high-density-impulse liquid
propellants that are safe, cheap and easy to handle.\nThe offeror must
demonstrate a clear understanding of the system applications of the
launch vehicle and the supporting technologies. A system application of
interest to the government is modifying the launch vehicle as a low-cost
 upper stage for DARPA\u2019s Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program.
Key design goals include balancing low gross mass with adequate velocity
 change, payload and manufacturing cost. Additionally, reusable launch
concepts such as XS-1 may carry stages through either normal or
longitudinally-oriented hardpoints\/racks.\nStages with efficient
structural arrangements to cope with such load paths while remaining low
 in mass and cost are of interest. Other potential system applications
include a wide range of commercial launch vehicles, tactical missiles,
satellite integral propulsion and future boost-glide tactical or air
transport systems. Similarly, a clear understanding of the technology
applications to XS-1 as well as other proposed military and commercial
systems is also essential.\nCritical technologies could include
lightweight structures and propulsion, high-density-impulse propellants,
 miniaturized avionics, modular components, altitude compensation and
complementary aerodynamic\/propulsion integration, and stability,
guidance and control subsystems all integrated into the stage while
keeping the system simple and affordable. Offerors may seek to design
and fabricate an entire stage or only critical subsystems.\nPHASE I:
Develop the design, manufacturing and test approach for fabricating
extremely low-cost, high propellant mass fraction launch vehicles and
upper stages for space access. Critical component or analytical risk
reduction is encouraged. Identify potential system level and technology
applications of the proposed innovation. Although multiple applications
are encouraged, to help assess the military utility the proposed stage
should be useful as an upper stage on the XS-1 experimental spaceplane.

        "topic_name": "Design and Produce Millimeter Wave Dipole Chaff
with High Radar Cross Section",
        "description": "Current aircraft radio frequency (RF) chaff is
made from aluminum coated glass filaments produced in a continuous
strand and then cut to lengths that achieve the desired resonance at
frequencies in the 2-18 GHz band. The filaments require a slip coating
to prevent end welding of fibers when cut, and to minimize clumping when
 ejected. The typical chaff cartridge can contain millions of these
coated glass filaments and has multiple sections of different lengths to
 create a reflective response across many frequencies at the same time
[Ref. 2,3,4]. The millimeter wave band of 30 to 40 GHz is not addressed
in the fielded chaff cartridge. The current chaff material is not well
suited to be cut and packaged to lengths required for efficacy in the
millimeter wave region. Also, calculations show the amounts needed to
produce the required response in that region cannot be achieved in the
volume of the current chaff cartridge. Recent advances in nano-fibers,
nanotubes, meta-materials, conductive polymers, graphite fibers,
graphene fibers, metal nanowire technologies, and coating techniques
using copper, silver, aluminum, zinc, etc., provide some promise that
new higher performing chaff can be produced on a large scale. [Ref. 1,].
 The new chaff may be able to double, triple, or even quadruple the
number of dipoles in the available volume. A novel dipole chaff material
 is needed that can be utilized for millimeter wave frequencies, is low
cost, and can be produced easily in sufficient quantities, by industry,
to satisfy the needs of the military community. This new chaff must have
 high scattering RCS in the 33 to 38 GHz frequency band. Target
cartridge volume is 1.4 inch diameter X 5.8 inch long cylinder. It is
desired that the material RCS exceed 500 square meters at 35 GHz per
cartridge. NAVY - 10 PHASE I: Design, develop and prove feasibility of
new innovative chaff in accordance with the parameters in the
Description. Provide a detailed analysis conducted by modeling and
simulation, calculation or measurement of individual dipole RCS
performance and then scale up the RCS performance for a volumetric chaff
 cloud result. If objective is met for the proposed frequency band of 33
 to 38 GHz, then investigate the scalability of the material for the 2
to 18 GHz frequency band to show increase\/decrease of effectiveness.
Agglomeration or bird-nesting of dipole payload must not exceed 20
percent of sample to facilitate dispersion of the chaff payload upon
dispense. The target materials have been in existence for some time now
and the basic process of combining and coating have been the subject of
experimentation on a small scale. Production of a small quantity
consisting of a few ounces of the material to prove the ease of
manufacture and demonstrate the simplified process is desired. PHASE II:
 Develop a pilot scale manufacturing process for the chaff material.
Test material in a controlled environment and demonstrate that modeling
and simulation results confirm actual performance findings. Develop
plans to integrate the chaff with a dissemination device such as Navy
RR-129 cartridge form factor. Using Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)
 cartridges, produce and provide 30 flight test ready samples for
Government-furnished testing on an air platform in order to fully
characterize the effects of this chaff on a Navy test range. Work
produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective
contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence
as defined by DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program
Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have

imagery of fixed structures on land. Objects moving in the scene were
unfocused and generally not of value. For large vessels at sea in
relatively calm conditions, some advanced focusing algorithms are able
to provide high quality imagery but are not useful for small vessels
with very dynamic movements. For maritime environments, the community
has relied on low altitude (&amp;lt;1000\u2019) non-coherent techniques
that leverage lower clutter returns present in at these low grazing
angles. Coherent techniques based on SAR processing are far less
sensitive to grazing angle, allowing the platform to operate at higher
altitudes and steeper grazing angles (perhaps 10\u2019s of degrees). In
addition, they offer improved performance due to a richer set of
potential discriminants. Increased standoff ranges are attained using
the coherent techniques as well as allowing the use of lower cost, lower
 peak powered radars. The suggested approach differs from traditional
SAR in that the objective is not to \u201cfocus\u201d the target but
rather to leverage the nature of the target signature and the coherence
of the background to improve detection, tracking and discrimination.

 algorithms capable of dynamic route re-planning have been developed.
The application of such algorithms to Unmanned Air System (UAS) missions
 has remained limited. This limited application results from multiple
factors; however, the greatest obstacle is airworthiness certification.
The development of certification methods for these algorithms remains
challenging because of the difficulty in defining test cases and
expected results that suitably enumerate the broad range of conditions
and non-deterministic responses that may be generated in response to
complex environments. The current certification approach relies on
brute-force methods to exhaustively test the algorithms making
certification efforts prohibitive due to cost and schedule impacts.
Therefore, the Navy\u2019s current UAS inventory is limited to fixed,
pre-planned mission plans that prohibit fully integrated operations with
 the fleet. Test and certification techniques for navigation and
guidance algorithms specific to Naval missions are needed to integrate
higher levels of autonomy into Naval Aviation operations. A wide range
of classes of algorithms have seen application in recent UAS autonomous
path planning research, such as: potential field methods [1],
optimization methods [2], and heuristic search methods [3]. The present
inventory of these algorithms is quite large, and the application of
each class of algorithm can be quite nuanced. Although some
test\/demonstration cases have been proposed [4], new, robust analysis,
test, and demonstration techniques must be developed to enable the Navy
acquisition community to certify systems with autonomous path planning

faster-than-real-time) software-in-the-loop capabilities that provides a

rise integrated \u201csystem on chip\u201d (SOC) architecture, and the
continuing need to handle more data more quickly, traditional electronic
 interconnects are reaching their practical limits. Optical data
transfer has already replaced electronic data transfer in long distance
applications (km) and shorter distance high bandwidth applications
(m-cm) due the combination of high bandwidth and low loss. Optical
interconnects can also be very robust in extreme temperature and
radiation environments making them well suited for satellite and
unmanned vehicle applications. Optical data transfer over shorter
(cm-mm) distances faces several significant technical and integration
challenges. Some of these challenges are directly related to scaling:
diffraction limitations, coupling efficiencies and cross talk, and
fabricating efficient scaled emitters and detectors. Other challenges
are related to material and wavelength challenges. Silicon, the
semiconductor of choice for the electronic industry, has an indirect
optical band gap making it an inefficient emitter or lasing material.
Silicon, while a common detector material for visible wavelength, cannot
 be used as a detector for the common telecommunication wavelengths
(1550 nm and 1330 nm). All silicon\/silicon oxide optical interconnects
would be ideal for integrating with conventional CMOS fabrication,
however it is likely that techniques utilizing alternate semiconductors
will be required at least in the near term. Current solutions include
epitaxial germanium and wafer bonded III-V semiconductors for detectors
and emitters. Hardening the optoelectronic components of optical
interconnects to radiation effects (total ionizing dose, displacement
damage, single events, color center formation, and optical loss) is
necessary before they are incorporated in satellites or unmanned
vehicles (unmanned aerial vehicles or robots) that are expected to
operate in high radiation environments. Electronics and optoelectronics
in these systems are typically expected to be able retain functionality
during gamma, neutron, and high energy ion exposures with lifetime total
 ionizing doses between 100kRad and 1MRad (silicon). Optical
interconnects may also offer significant advantages in hardening systems
 against electromagnetic pulses and electromagnetic weapons by
eliminating the antenna effects caused by cabling or long electrical
interconnects.\nPHASE I: Demonstration and preliminary radiation effects

active optical interconnect component (e.g. emitter, modulator,
detector). Development of a plan for scaled (or near scaled) complete
optical interconnect prototype.\nPHASE II: Development, fabrication, and
 preliminary radiation effects testing (to a WMD relevant dose) of a
scaled or near scaled optical interconnect prototype with at least two
active components and a coupled waveguide. Development of an approach

lasers, gas guns, etc.), an exciting opportunity exists for directly
probing material deformation mechanisms under extreme loading

significant hurdle to providing a complete mapping of the temporal

methods that enhance x-ray diffraction and\/or x-ray imaging
measurements are desired, including both direct and indirect detection
methods. Indirect detection uses phosphors or scintillators to convert
x-rays to visible photons; whereas, direct detection schemes directly
convert an x-ray photon to an electrical signal for readout. Certain
detection schemes are currently more attractive to different
experimental conditions and regimes of interest. PHASE I: Any new or

particle distribution and fluid flow that result in formation of the
final plume. The instrumentation developed must be stand-off or
ruggedized to survive the high temperature, high pressure and
corrosive\/reactive atmosphere created by weapon engagement with a
chemical\/biological target, and demonstrate repeatable performance
under such field conditions. Smaller, agile instruments that can be
easily transported from one site to another, requiring minimal utilities
 (power, water, etc.) and infrastructure at field site, is optimum. In
addition, instruments should collect data in a highly dynamic
environment where chemical reactions of chemical agents and physical
changes such as fluid flow and particle-size redistribution may be
occurring at microsecond to millisecond time scales. Specifically we are
 interested in measuring the following: \u2022 Temperature as a function
 of space and time, \u2022 Chemical specie and concentration as a
function of space and time and \u2022 Droplet\/particle velocity and
size distribution as a function of space and time. Spatially resolved
measurements, where a single instrument could collect data from multiple
 positions within or just outside the fireball, are desired. The
measurements from these instruments and data obtained from testing will
provide the basis for modeling and simulation of the first few seconds
of the expanding fireball. Temperature measurements of laboratory scale
clean (no agent\/simulant\/by products or other debris) fireballs have
progressed using pyrometry and emission spectroscopy. Species have been
measured with mass spectroscopy and other optical techniques and
particle size distribution by particle image velocimetry. However these
techniques have not scaled up to larger scale up to field scale because
of at least two reasons. First the fireball is dirty containing not only
 detonation products but agent\/simulant and byproducts and other debris
 and second the environment is extremely harsh making instrument
survival difficult. PHASE I: Provide proof of concept for
next-generation instrumentation for quantitative and qualitative
characterization of the physical and chemical process in fireballs.
Demonstrate feasibility that new technologies will survive and collect
useful data in the harsh environment of explosive fireballs. A proof of
concept demonstration shall consist of measuring at least one of the
following; temperature as a function of space and time, chemical specie
and concentration as a function of space and time and droplet\/particle
velocity and size distribution as a function of space and time in an
explosively generated fireball consisting of explosive detonation
products and Triethyl phosphate (TEP), a commonly used simulant. It is
anticipated that this would be a laboratory scale test. Technologies of
interest include but are not limited to PHASE II: Expand the technology
to other relevant agents\/simulants. Scale-up, ruggedize and deliver
prototypes of instrumentation to demonstrate in relevant testing. Plan
and conduct small-scale testing within project scope, and participate in
 government-provided mid- to large-scale explosives testing. Demonstrate
 cost-effective data analysis and fast turn-around for repeated testing.
 PHASE III: Support testing at DTRA Test Division (J9CXT); DTRA Weapons
Division (J9CXW) the Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and
Development Center (ERDC); Air Force Research Lab (AFRL); Naval Surface
Warfare Centers (NSWC); Naval Air Warfare Centers (NAWC); Energetic

        "topic_name": "Joint Learning of Text-based Categories",
        "description": "J9CXQ has the challenge of identifying and
extracting evidential information from a complex and ambiguous text. An
automated extraction system is being developed that will detect and
characterize categories of entities, relations, events, and topics. The
extracted information will be stored in a knowledge base that will
enable automatically finding patterns and searching for critical
information. These detection and extraction algorithms depend on
well-formed definitions of the elements (entities, relations, events).
They are further disambiguated using context such as the topics found in
 the documents. These definitions typically expressed as a probability
distribution. Since these elements are not known beforehand the
algorithms must not only characterize them, but also discover them in
the first place. The task of creating these characterizations are too
large to do manually, and even when known beforehand, the task of
annotating is prohibitive, hence it is necessary to automate the process
 both to discover the categories and then represent them
probabilistically. Traditionally this is done using an unsupervised
learning algorithm such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Currently,
 despite the fact that each of the elements is highly interrelated (i.e.
 topic, entity, relations and events), each of these are learned
independently. What is needed is to learn all of these elements in an
interrelated manner. This is because a better characterization of one
will improve characterizations of the other. For example, topics are
identified in an unsupervised way using entity classes are found by
clustering in vector spaces in an unsupervised way, or named entity
recognition (e.g. using conditional random fields) in a supervised way.
Not only will a joint learning approach improve accuracy, but it will
also enable tighter, more specific classes which should make the overall
 analysis of text much more powerful. J9CXQ is seeking research in the
area of knowledge representation and reasoning systems that can support
the following combination of requirements:\n(1) The method should infer
classes of entities, relationships, and contextual topics in a joint
manner to account for interdependencies.\n(2) The method should not
require extensive annotation, and should be unsupervised or require a
minimal amount of human input.\n(3) None of the classes are predefined,
but they are discovered through learning.\n(4) Readily adapts or
transfers to new domains,\n(5) The ability for an analyst to set the
topic or distribution of entities or relations and see the effect on the
 remaining variables.\n(6) Ideally, the method will include context
information and should not be solely based on a bag-of-words language
model.\n(7) Flexible output that facilitates data analysis and
visualization.\n(8) Given the novelty of the method, it should be well
documented both within the source code and auxiliary supportive
documentation.\nPHASE I: From basic research develop and demonstrate
proof-of-concept. Research and develop methodologies that should infer
classes of entities, relationships, and contextual topics in a joint
manner to account for interdependencies. At the conclusion of Phase I,
produce a conceptual architecture design identifying necessary hardware
and software to create a system and identify technology gaps that must
be resolved prior to building a system. Develop a proof-of-concept
demonstration to support the architecture design.\nPHASE II: Build a
prototype system that will support testing and evaluation. Develop,
demonstrate, and validate a prototype system based on the preliminary
design from Phase I. All appropriate engineering testing will be
performed, and a critical design review will be performed to finalize
the design. The Phase II deliverable will include a working prototype of
 the software, specification for its development, and demonstration of
the eight specified requirements.\nPHASE III: Integrate into the J9CXQ
CWMD Analyst Reasoning Environment to provide a new inference capability
 over extracted events, entities and relationships. Optimize the
prototype system and demonstrate it at the full scale level. This
technology will have broad application in military, government, and
commercial settings. Within the military and government, there is an
increasing emphasis on technologies that aid decision-makers while
managing big data. Developing tools that can rapidly integrate
information and provide a process for analyzing data to compliment a
user\u2019s decision making process will be a powerful addition to
strategic, operational, and tactical decision making.",

        "topic_name": "Island-mode Enhancement Strategies and
Methodologies for Defense Critical Infrastructure",
        "description": "The defense critical infrastructure (DCI) is the
 composite of DoD and non-DoD assets essential to project, support, and
sustain military forces and operations worldwide. The DCI includes, but
is not limited to, elements such as military bases, ballistic missile
defense installations, radar sites, etc. An electromagnetic (EM) attack
(nuclear electromagnetic pulse [EMP] or non-nuclear EMP [e.g.,
high-power microwave, HPM]) has the potential to degrade or shut down
portions of the electric power grid important to the DoD. While a power
grid may employ intentional islanding techniques to protect sections of
the grid and prevent a cascading collapse of the power grid, the broad
reach of potential EM attacks with the potential of simultaneous levels
of disruption might prevent traditional islanding protection methods
from being sufficient for continued operations of the DCI. Restoring the
 commercial grid from the still functioning regions may not be possible
or could take weeks or months. Significant elements of the DCI require
uninterrupted power for prolonged periods to perform time-critical
missions (e.g., sites hardened to MIL-STD-188-125-1). To ensure these
continued operations, DCI sites must be able to function as a microgrid
that can operate in both grid-connected and intentional island-mode
(grid-isolated). Such a microgrid is defined as a group of
interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within clearly
defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity
with respect to the power grid. The purpose of this topic is, through
systematic study of a typical DCI site, to develop enhanced
methodologies and technologies for providing intentional island-mode
capability at DCI sites in the event of grid loss. Methodologies should
account for the need of immediate and continuous operations at sites and
 the seamless transition to and from commercial power (grid-connected
and grid isolated states). The emphasis of this project should be on
determining how to best prepare an existing DoD site for intentional
island-mode operation and identifying major risks and hurdles. This work
 will require refinement of existing technologies and development of new
 technologies and is directed specifically toward applying the new
knowledge to meet the survivability of DoD sites to EM attacks affecting
 large geographical areas. The goal of this project is to develop a set
of methodologies and strategies that can be applied, along with existing
 methods, to enhance the resilience of DCI assets such as military
bases. Such methods should aide in the development of islanding at DoD
sites to ensure survivability to geographically large EM threats. These
methods may also be applied to the commercial sector and other areas of
the government: hospitals, civilian infrastructure, businesses, etc.
PHASE I: The successful Phase I project should develop innovative
strategies and methodologies for DCI island-mode operations in the event
 of power grid disruption or failure due to an EM threat. Sufficient
detail should be developed to show technical competency and\/or proof of
 concept. Phase I strategies as well as establishing performance goals.
Additionally, a draft roadmap should be developed indicating Phase II
and Phase III plans, timelines, and addressing key decision points and
milestones. PHASE II: Phase II will focus on intentional island-mode
methodologies and strategies at a specific DCI site (TBD). Limited
initial testing may occur at a proto-type site, via modeling, or prior
to full scale testing at a DCI site. Identify and address key
island-mode hurdles, limitations, and obstacles and provide
recommendations on addressing these areas. Methodologies and strategies
should be improved and expanded based on testing, assessments, and
available date. Clear documentation on strategies\/methodologies and
improvements is a priority. Identification of dual use commercial
applications is an important aspect of this phase. PHASE III: The Phase
III project would focus execution of the Phase II test plan and on
expanding these methodologies and strategies to include
systems\/infrastructure outside the DCI. This could include other
DoD\/government agency sites, hospitals, civilian infrastructure, or
other commercial sites. Methodologies developed for the site specific
work in Phase II could be expanded for a different site or generalized
to create overarching guidelines.",

        "topic_name": "Multi-mode Handheld Radioisotope Identification
Instrument",
        "description": "DTRA is seeking development of handheld
radioisotope identification instrumentation with extended capabilities
for identifying and categorizing isotopic sources. Passive measurements
of gamma-ray signatures can be adversely compromised by shielding around
 the source. Neutrons are an additional signature that may either
substantiate a finding or, more importantly, elucidate an anomaly that
may arise from purposeful shielding. Currently offered instruments tend
to optionally include neutron detectors of limited sensitivity that can
be added to otherwise, gamma-ray centered designs. Of particular
interest is to significantly increase thermal neutron sensitivity to a
minimum of 15 cps\/nv. Furthermore, instrumentation may also find a role
 in verification and inspections, and determining the presence of
particular Pu isotopes (or their enrichment) through fast neutron
spectroscopy would be beneficial. Note here that such a goal
specifically requires sensitivity to energetic neutrons (to several
MeV). It is preferable that the instrument is capable of accomplishing
all detection functions without need for optional sensors that may
increase the unit size, weight, or power consumption. The preferred
form-factor is that of a compact instrument than can be personally worn
or carried in a holster, allowing for hands-free operation. Examples of
operation and form would be the identiFinder \u00ae R400 and HDS-101GN.
The instrument should meet or exceed the requirements of the relevant
ANSI N42.34[1] standard for handheld instruments for the detection and
identification of radionuclides, and include the capability to
distinguish neutrons by energy (thermal versus fast). Solutions must
employ low-power electronics and need to be battery operated with useful
 lifetime targets of 8+ hours between recharge or replacement. There is a
 high desire for solutions that are physically robust and insensitive to
 adverse environmental conditions. The systems should be capable of
identifying radioisotopic sources in mixed radiation (gamma plus
neutron) environments. Instruments may be entirely self-contained or may
 utilize a short range wireless connection (e.g. Bluetooth) to commonly
available tablet, laptop or smartphone devices for user interaction.
Overall practicality of the operating conditions and ergonomics should
be a factor in selecting packaging designs. For gamma-rays, it is
desirable to utilize detectors that can achieve an energy resolution of
&amp;lt; 5% FWHM at 662 keV. Additionally, the sensitivity should be
greater than 1000 cps\/\u03bcSv\/hr for Cs-137. Commercial radioisotope
identification software can be used. Ultimately, it is preferable that
the instrument be capable of running GADRAS software[2] for radioisotope
 identification. Minimally, it should provide file formats compatible
with the ANSI N42.42 standard[3]. PHASE I: Identify key operational
components and develop the initial design of the handheld radioisotope
identification instrument. Extensive modelling studies must be performed
 to demonstrate detector sensitivity, and capability for gamma, fast and
 thermal neutron detection and radioisotope identification. Demonstrate
pathways to meeting performance goals in Phase II. PHASE II: Develop a
prototype instrument that accomplishes the goals of gamma-ray, thermal
and fast neutron measurements. The instrument shall not be dependent on
post-acquisition analysis of data. Incorporate GADRAS or other
radioisotope identification software. Demonstrate radioisotopic
identification consistent with N42.34, identifying areas where the
prototype diverges from the standard. Demonstrate the application of
neutron detection to identification of radioisotopes with specific
examples of SNM. PHASE III: DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Develop a commercial
instrument, with suitable partners as needed, for military applications
of interest to DTRA as well as domestic applications to support first
responders and regulatory inspections, border and port security, power
plant maintenance and environmental clean-up.",

to assist the Warfighter in learning and becoming operationally
proficient with the system. This topic seeks to take this a step further
 by leveraging gaming technologies to determine critical areas of
performance and to also design a wrapper to encourage the users to
"play" the system, exercising those critical components to refine
performance. Modeling and simulation using white cell participants is a
common method of training. However, no methods using this approach give
instant feedback in a competitive gaming environment. The goal of this
topic is to analyze current gaming techniques and determine if any of
them could be applied to missile defense battle management training. The
 effort should address and investigate methodologies for improving
learning, participation, and motivation through the application of
gaming technologies. Feedback should include some type of reward,
possibly points, where the users can compete for skill levels. In
planning a missile defense design, the blue force asset lay-down
(consisting of sensors, shooters, and command and control (C2) elements)
 will vary in number. Collaboration between shooters via their elements
also varies based on both proximity (communications restrictions) and
capability. The threat (red force asset lay-down) will also vary in
number and capability. Particularly in Phase I, the researcher can
assume simple kinematic impact of nominal missile defense threat
trajectories in order to create threat scenarios for scoring analysis.
The researcher can also assume simple sensor characteristics when
determining intercept timelines. Shooters may consist of single or
multiple missile configurations with basic ballistic missile
trajectories. The goal is not to replicate current missile defense
planning system analysis capabilities, or to develop placement
optimization routines, but to focus on innovative ways to assess threat
(red force) versus asset (blue force) missile defense design scenarios
and to score the results in order to provide dynamic feedback to the
operator. This feedback capability will optimize operator training with
respect to determining planning methodologies and inherently improve
retention and overall knowledge of battlespace management. A key focus
of the innovation is identifying the set of variables, parameters and
skills over which performance levels should be tested.\nPHASE I: Develop
 and demonstrate a gaming concept utilizing a missile defense design
scoring algorithm that accommodates multiple threats of varying types

elements also with varying capabilities. Provide feedback to the game
participant in a quantitatively measurable format. Provide the

defense assets during raid scenarios in stressing environments.
Demonstrate how the gaming concepts improve the operator\u2019s ability

 at no cost if the developer wishes to utilize the facility for high
fidelity testing.\nPHASE III: Demonstrate the new technologies via
operation as part of a complete system or operation in a system-level

drill planning, automated processing, accident trauma response planning,

Arrays",
        "description": "This topic focuses on enabling next generation
sensors and improving FPA performance beyond the current
state-of-the-art to support future missile defense applications. This
topic seeks low noise, high sensitivity FPA technologies that detect
very low signal levels. Current FPA technologies for imaging in
low-light conditions at SWIR wavelengths are limited by poor quantum
efficiency and\/or poor noise characteristics. Silicon-based
technologies offer low noise devices; however, the quantum efficiencies
of these devices is typically a few percent at SWIR wavelengths.
Technologies based on other substrates (HgCdTe, InGaAs, etc.) have
fairly high quantum efficiencies (greater than 50%) at SWIR wavelengths,
 but the noise characteristics of these devices are typically too large
for very low light sensing conditions. Technologies based on avalanche
photodiodes (APDs) are capable of imaging in low-light conditions;
however, APD technologies have limitations: in the case of Geiger mode
APDs, their response to input photon flux is non-linear and in the case
of linear-mode APDs, their array sizes are small. This topic does not
focus on particular substrate\/readout integrated circuit combinations
but solicits technical solutions for imaging objects under low light
conditions at SWIR wavelengths. Goals for the topic are: 1) quantum
efficiencies for silicon-based substrates that are greater than 60% (at
900nm), 35% (at 1000nm), and 20% (at 1100 nm) or quantum efficiencies
for non-silicon-based substrates that are greater than 30% across the
900-1200 nm region 2) dark currents that are less than 100
electrons\/pixel\/second at 77K 3) readout noises less than 5 electrons
4) formats that are greater than 512 X 512 with extensibility to 1k X 1k
 5) frame rates of 30Hz with integration times up to 30 milliseconds 6)
programmable with capability of 2 X 2 binning of pixels 7) excess noise
factor that is less than 2 for technologies that use gain 8) linear
response to incident flux The proposed technologies should also include
designs that mitigate the effects of harsh radiation environments to
prevent catastrophic system failure.\nPHASE I: Conduct modeling,
simulations, and analysis (MS&amp;A), and proof-of-principle experiments
 of the critical elements for the proposed FPA technology. This phase
should validate the feasibility of the proposed technology. Phase I will
 conclude with a proof-of-concept design review of the detector
technology to include a clear, concise technology development plan and
schedule, predicted FPA performance metrics, a transition risk
assessment, and associated requirements documentation. The contractor is
 strongly encouraged to collaborate and cultivate relationships with
other system and\/or sensor payload contractors to ensure the
applicability of the FPA technology and to initiate work towards
technology transition. No specific contact information will be provided
by the topic authors.\nPHASE II: Using the resulting processes, designs,
 techniques, and architectures, developed in Phase I, fabricate a
prototype or engineering demonstration unit of the FPA technology.
Perform characterization testing of the FPA within the program
constraints of cost and schedule. The characterization tests should show
 the performance achieved from the FPA technology. Environmental
testing: vibration, thermal, and radiation testing (if applicable) is
encouraged. Differences between the MS&amp;A and the FPA performance
data should be noted. During this phase, the contractor should continue
to collaborate and cultivate relationships with other system and\/or
sensor payload contractors while considering the overall objective of
commercialization of the detector technology in Phase III.\nPHASE III:
The offeror will implement and verify in full scale, either solely, or
in partnership with a suitable production foundry, that the Phase II
demonstration technology is economically viable. Assist in transitioning
 the detector technology for missile defense applications to an
appropriate contractor for engineering integration and testing.
Commercialization: The contractor will pursue commercialization of the
various technologies developed in Phase II for potential commercial uses
 in other government applications. In addition, there are potential
applications for detector technologies in a wide range of diverse fields
 that include astronomy, commercial satellite imagery, optical and
free-space communications, law enforcement, maritime and aviation

state power amplifier (SSPA) technologies that meet or exceed the output
 power (greater than 1 kW), duty factor, operating frequency
(K-band:20-22 GHz), reliability, sustainability, and supportability
achievable with existing traveling-wave tube amplifiers as a potential
replacement for klystron tubes in future communication systems. Klystron
 tube technology has reliability and supportability issues resulting
from manufacturing processes and component (tungsten wire) availability.
 The proposed SSPA architecture should consist of a modular design which
 provides an additive power approach based on multiple radio frequency
(RF) modules linked together to achieve desired power while providing
for gradual degradation when a single RF module fails so components can
be replaced without having to remove input power. Currently, input power
 must be cut when replacing a failed klystron. SSPA technologies that
leverage built-in-tests and diagnostics to provide fault detection and
isolation at a line replaceable unit level should be emphasized. This
level of fault determination should allow for efficient replacement of
failed hardware components and demonstrate enhanced safety for system
operators and maintainers. Another goal of this topic is to demonstrate
fast SSPA warm-up times (less than a 1 second \u201cwarm-up\u201d time
prior transmission). Finally, the proposed SSPA technology should
demonstrate enhanced availability and reliability to meet operational
readiness at minimal cost. PHASE I: The contractor should develop a
generic solid state HPA design that provides for future growth potential
 to support emerging interceptor communications requirements. The design
 should document expected reliability, availability, sustainability and
supportability performance at power levels and duty factors that are
sufficient for communications. PHASE II: The contractor should
transition the generic solid state high power amplifier design completed
 in Phase I into a system specific end item prototype suitable for
testing via insertion into an existing missile defense application. The
prototype and design documentation should be provided to the government.
 PHASE III: The contractor should integrate the Phase II prototype into
an existing government hardware string and then conduct subsystem and
system level testing to ensure compatibility with legacy communication
hardware components. The contractor will be expected to refine the
design as needed to address any needed changes identified during testing
 to satisfy communication design\/performance requirements.
Commercialization: This innovative technology would have benefits for
all commercial and\/or defense systems applications operating in the X,
Ka, K, &amp;amp; Ku bands requiring reliable, sustainable high power
amplification of RF energy (e.g. commercial and military satellite
communications) but the benefits are also applicable to bands above and
below those specific bands. The contractor proposal should clearly

simultaneously requiring reductions in space, weight and power (SWaP).
The replacement of the coaxial cable used in various onboard RF\/analog
applications with RF\/analog fiber optic links will provide increased
immunity to electromagnetic interference, reduction in size and weight,
and an increase in bandwidth. However it requires the development of
high performance, high linearity optoelectronic components that can meet
 extended temperature range requirements (-40 to 100 degrees Celsius
(C)). Additionally, avionic platforms pose stringent requirements on the
 SWaP consumption of components such as optical transmitters for avionic

optical component technology will need to be developed. Current analog
optical transmitter technology typically consists of discrete lasers and
 modulators operating at 1550 nanometers (nm), with a requirement for
active cooling for operation in avionic environments. To meet avionic
requirements, the transmitter should integrate laser and modulator into a
 compact uncooled package that can maintain performance over full
avionic temperature range. It is envisioned that a Gallium Arsenide

Modules",
        "description": "Surface aviation and amphibious assault ships
launch and recover aircraft whose pilots typically use Night Vision
Devices (NVDs) for night operations. As a result, the NVD flight deck
lighting solution requires control and dimming of various individual
lighting fixtures and circuits aboard these ships. Digitally addressable
 control of these lighting fixtures is required in order to dim and\/or
turn these lights on and off depending on what the flight operations and
 atmospheric conditions require. The US Navy desires a new solution for
aviation lighting aboard air capable ships utilizing LED technology
through a standardized smart module that will be able to recognize the
lighting package configuration and what type of fixture it is
controlling through embedded firmware\/software; this would allow lights
 of different functions and power requirements to be daisy chained,
significantly reducing cable runs and installation costs. As lights are
added to the system, they should self-configure and appear on the
operator control panel in the correct lighting group. The smart module
would eliminate the need for multiple configurations, set-up issues and
complex troubleshooting while providing a simplified configuration that
allows it to be easily replaced when a light is not able to be turned
on\/off, dimmed, or flashed from the operator control panel. Failures of
 any light should not affect the operation of any other light. The
existing lighting control system includes an expensive (estimated
$60,000) electronics box, FLEXDRIVER, which drives up to forty-eight
light fixtures on a ship in each enclosure; this reduces system
reliability and creates single point failures. A large ship may need in
excess of twelve FLEXDRIVER\u2019s, each of which must be individually
configured for the compliment of lights the flight deck has. Each
configuration is a unique mix of multiple driver cards for the specific
light fixtures it drives and each light has a direct connection to a
FLEXDRIVER, increasing system cabling. An innovative approach is needed
to identify the most cost effective methods to achieve successful
installation of the smart module. Objectives to consider include the
ability to reduce the system cable plant, minimize system
interconnections, provide redundancy for fault tolerance, provide for
on\/off, flashing and dimming control of various lighting groups,
configurations that can be incorporated into existing lighting fixtures
or interconnection junction boxes while minimizing total system cost of
ownership. The consolidated control of the total system would be over
the shipboard Local Area Network (LAN). The proposed system should meet
strict Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) requirements of Mil-STD-461
and navy shipboard environmental requirements. Of note, there are twelve
 different LED lighting fixtures of varying quantities that make up the
Advanced Flight Deck Lighting (AFDL) system. More will be developed in
the future. Current lighting fixtures range from a single LED fixture to
 fixtures containing multiple LED strings (1-6) with different voltage
(3-28VDC) and current (68-3150ma) requirements.\n\nPHASE I: Design and
demonstrate the feasibility of a universal smart LED Light Fixture
Control module, as discussed in the Description section, with respective
 embedded firmware\/software capable of having universal applications on
 all US Navy flight decks while identifying methods to keep overall
system costs to a minimum.\n\nPHASE II: Based on the Phase I effort
develop a production-representative prototype of an LED Light Fixture
Control smart module and demonstrate its functionality in a lighting
control system on a shipboard representative lighting layout with either
 real or simulated loads, provided by NAVAIR (e.g., either a test bench
or real fixtures at NAVAIR Lakehurst or a location to be determined
(TBD)). Design concepts should be updated to detailed design
documentation. Analysis of shipboard environmental sustainability should
 be provided at a minimum, with environmental testing of the PRM
conducted ideally. The ability to provide a failure analysis is desired,
 as is an estimate of service life.\n\nPHASE III: Finalize development
of an optimized LED Light Fixture Control smart module design for
robustness and full environmental qualification, including shock
testing. Test prototype in conjunction with a shipboard representative
flight deck lighting system (TBD by NAVAIR). Produce units for delivery

Communicate and Operate in a Multi- level Security Environment",
        "description": "The Electronic Kneeboard (EKB) is currently
being developed to enable access to digital publications, tactical
imagery, and other dynamic data in all USN and USMC aircraft. This
capability will greatly enhance aircrew situational awareness, reduce
cockpit clutter, improve precision fire, and enable in-flight mission
re-planning. The warfighter would greatly benefit from a mobile platform
 capable of communicating on multi-level security domains, leveraging
any and all available transport media. The utility of EKB is dependent
on a tablet device ability to operate at both unclassified and
classified levels, within a loosely-defined and inconsistent
connectivity model. Unclassified operation will be required for various
administrative functions (Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures
Standardization (NATOPS)\/Naval Aviation Technical Information Product
(NATIP)\/Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), study, access to email,
and routine mission planning); while the classified environment will be
essential for tactical mission execution that includes but is not
limited to ingestion of live data feeds, chat, tactical imagery, etc.
The objective of this project is to design and develop a software-based
solution to achieve unclassified and classified (definition for
classified is Secret) personas on a single tablet. The development
effort will have to address a major challenge, which will require a
highly innovative approach to devise a software tool that is
sufficiently "secure" to meet National Security Agency (NSA)
requirements for highly classified communications. Proposers should
consider the requirements of NSA\u2019s Commercial Solutions for
Classified (CSfC) program (see reference below). Further, the
software-based solution should utilize a variety of transport media to
send\/receive data from\/to the device when a network connection is
present. The solution should address the need for predictable, timely
execution of system commands. The software tool should utilize a smart
algorithm\/load balancer to analyze available connections and make the
most efficient use of the bandwidth provided over each security level,
based on network performance metrics, application priority, and others.
For example, a shipboard environment may have a Satellite Communications
 (SATCOM) presence\/Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services
 (CANES) Wi-Fi, a Forward Operating Base may have SATCOM\/cellular, and a
 training squadron may have cell\/Wi-Fi\/Navy Marine Corps Intranet
(NMCI) hardwire. This approach would enable devices to receive, process,
 and display a variety of data types from existing networks, aircraft
systems, and sensors. Data types to include standard Office documents,
imagery files, e-mail, text, and voice traffic. A smart processing
construct is critical to the success of this effort. Current solutions
in this problem space fail to effectively leverage both internal system
resources and external system interfaces. Internal resources (i.e.
system memory, Central Processing Unit (CPU) cycles) are simply divided
based on a predetermined split across various virtual machines. This
structured methodology does not account for the dynamic reallocation of
critical resources based on mission need. Further, current tablet
technologies do not gracefully assess system interfaces and the
bandwidth available across each of them. Standard bandwidth monitoring
techniques are obtrusive, utilizing methods which further exacerbate the
 limited bandwidth problem.\n\nPHASE I: Design and develop a
software-based concept to achieve high assurance data
isolation\/compartmentalization via dynamic data
identification.\n\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype software tool with a
path towards multi-level secure processing capability and certification.
 Preliminary testing of the prototype will be conducted with the
inputs\/artifacts provided by the government sponsor to support flight
certification process. Demonstration of load\/resource balancing across
security levels is key. Work produced in Phase II may become classified.

assure interoperability with existing EKB applications (list to be

coated copper materials which occurs when the silver coating does not
adequately cover the underlying copper and is exposed to water by either
 direct contact or condensation. Red Plague causes degradation of the
anodic copper while leaving the cathodic silver plating intact. More
details for causes and current mitigation provided in in SAE-ARP-6400,

\u201cCorrosion of Silver-Plated Copper Conductor.\u201d Therefore, the
silver \u201cstraw\u201d can carry current during a normal incoming
inspection conductivity test and most system level high-frequency
checks, but without the copper's strength and ductility, silver cannot
carry the shock and vibration load in flight environments. Silver plated
 copper wire provides many advantages over other conductor systems such
as excellent solderability, crimpability, and flexibility. The intent of
 this topic is ultimately to create a system which can be used to
perform non-destructive testing on XL-ETFE insulated silver plated
copper wire and determine acceptability prior to implementation within
hardware. One proposed method for creating this system is by utilizing
the skin effect. As frequency of a signal increases, a given conductor
will carry more and more of the signal on the "skin" of the conductor.
This is often referred to as "skin effect." Conversely, as the frequency
 decreases a more uniform distribution of current within the conductor
is obtained. Therefore, within a given length of XL-ETFE insulated
silver plated copper conductor (with 40 microinch mean plating
thickness), a method could be developed such that by applying signals at
 various frequencies, and measuring the AC impedance at frequency of the
 wire length it may be possible to determine relative extent of copper
conductor degradation from varying degrees and numbers of sites of Red
Plague corrosion. The levels of the variable frequency currents applied
may also impact current density at corrosion sites and be used to
determine effects to the characteristics of the wire from this
corrosion.\nPHASE I: Develop a non-destructive test method to detect the
 presence of Red Plague. Conduct experimental and\/or analytical efforts
 to demonstrate that Red Plague can be created consistently within a lab
 environment for use in the analysis of the non-destructive testing
(NDT) method. It is critical that the performing company can
consistently create a known amount of damage due to Red Plague within an
 XL-ETFE wire for verification of the non-destructive test
method.\nPHASE II: Conduct experimental and\/or analytical efforts to
demonstrate proof-of-principle of proposed technology. Investigations
shall consider the viability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of
solutions to locate and quantify extent of Red Plague within XL-ETFE
insulated silver plated copper conductor. Demonstrate the technology by
developing a prototype in a representative environment. Demonstrate
feasibility and engineering scale up of proposed technology as well as
identify and address technological hurdles. Demonstrate the
system\u2019s viability and superiority under a wide variety of
conditions typical of both normal and extreme operating
conditions.\nPHASE III: Successfully demonstrate direct applicability or
 near-term application of technology in one or more missile defense
applications. Demonstration should be in a real system or operational in
 a system level test-bed. This demonstration should also verify the
potential for enhancement of quality, reliability, performance, and
reduction of total ownership cost of the proposed subject.
Commercialization pathways should be identified for both military and
civilian applications. Commercialization: Equally important to military
utility is the transferability of proposed technologies to Red Plague
detection in aerospace, automotive, and industrial uses. The proposed
technology should benefit commercial and defense systems through cost
reduction as well as improved reliability and sustainment. As enabling
technologies, it is anticipated that commercial and industrial

premature deterioration or failure at damage sites in metal structures
thereby necessitating monitoring, maintenance, repair or replacement.
PIM emissions are a known problem for ships and land-based cellular
systems where metal structures simultaneously receive RF radiation on
two or more different signal frequencies. The received RF signal
frequencies may then cause RF currents to flow in metal structures that
can be non-linearly mixed together in metal-to-metal contacts in the
structures affected by galvanic corrosion. These RF currents may then
generate additional new intermodulation RF emissions from the structures
 due to sum and difference harmonic mixing of the two or more original
frequencies. PIM may occur in a variety of areas from coaxial connectors
 to cables, rusty bolts, or any metallic structure joint where
dissimilar metals or similar metals in an electrolyte occur. Corrosion
sites could include poor, loose, or contaminated connectors, junctions
between dissimilar metals, and mechanical connections that have become
oxidized, or contaminated with typical corrosion chemicals found in
missile defense systems. Demonstrate that PIM RF emissions have the
capability to accurately detect and characterize degradation arising
from galvanic corrosion processes in metal structures. Areas of emphasis
 include determining if various conditions of corrosion severity found
at points on a metal structure can be accurately and repeatedly
identified to determine where and when a particular corrosion site is an
 issue for concern. Furthermore, the information gained by the preceding
 effort should be evaluated for its capability to support corrosion
degradation monitoring, corrosion modeling and determining applicable
acceleration factors for galvanic and other combinational corrosion
processes. Also desired from this effort is to determine whether the RF
currents that circulate due to RF radiation impinging on the metal
structures increase the PIM emissions. Resolve how RF radiation affects
or accelerates existing galvanic corrosion processes in the structures.
\nPHASE I: Demonstrate a proof-of-concept for detecting PIM RF emissions
 from metal structures and provide analysis of how effectively the
measurements are employed to detect and locate the corrosion points at
sites on metal structures. Identify prototype equipment items, develop a
 preliminary equipment design and document developed techniques.\nPHASE
II: Perform testing of a PIM detection prototype to obtain information
on PIM emission \u201csignatures\u201d of corrosion sites with known
differing metallurgical characteristics. Demonstrate that the results
are accurate and repeatable enough to provide a basis for degradation
monitoring, corrosion modeling and determination of corrosion model
acceleration factors. Develop a library of repeatable signatures of
corrosion to include metallurgical characteristics at corrosion sites
such as joint contact pressure, surface topology, current density and
area of the contact point.\nPHASE III: Develop a final equipment design
and hardware and transition to the government. This phase is to obtain
improved capability for identifying the presence and progression of
underlying galvanic corrosion in metal-to-metal contacts. This effort
offers significant cost avoidance for missile defense applications.
Positive results from this project have great potential to improve
system reliability, and to reduce the costs of metal structure corrosion
 from material and systems functional loss within the DoD, and on a
national commercial level. Commercialization: In the U.S., total direct
cost of corrosion is estimated at about 300 billion dollars per year;
which is about 3.2% of domestic product. Corrosion also interferes with
human safety, disrupts industrial operations and presents dangers to the
 environment. Positive results from this project have great potential to
 improve system reliability and to reduce the costs of metal structure
corrosion within the DoD and on a national commercial level.",

        "topic_name": "High Peak Power 1.9 um Thulium-Doped Solid-State
Lasers for Next-Generation Compact and Robust High Peak-Power Blue
Lasers",
        "description": "A need exists for high pulse energy high
repetition-rate lasers for LIDAR transmitters. LIDAR systems have been
shown to be a powerful tool to remotely probe various oceanographic and
atmospheric processes. Each system generally requires specialized
transmitters at often hard to achieve wavelengths. Often the lasers
available to hit these wavelengths are not suited for high peak-power
operation. A Thulium and Holmium 2 um system, together, is ideally
suited to cover this requirement. It has a large tuning range, and in
combination with one or two frequency conversion steps, it can cover a
large part of the electro-magnetic spectrum. Furthermore, the long-lived
 upper states required for energy storage can facilitate high pulse
energy operation. There is even more compelling motivation for the Navy
that is driving the development of this high peak-power 1.9 -um solid
state laser. There has been a requirement for a high peak-power blue
laser system solution to be operated in pulsed mode with high repetition
 rate for standoff oceanographic sensing applications. A combination of
the intrinsic wide tuning range of Thulium and a two stage
second-harmonic generation (SHG) can be utilized to generate light
optimized for different ocean scenarios. The current state-of-the-art
blue laser solutions with high peak-power capability usually incorporate
 complex, inefficient, and relatively bulky and heavy multiple-stage
non-linear processes that require second or third harmonic generations
and\/or optical parametric oscillation approaches. These approaches
often do not meet the stringent space, weight, power (SWaP) and
performance and reliability requirements set forth by the Navy.
Therefore, it is anticipated that frequency quadrupling of a compact
high peak-power 1.9 um laser would potentially result in a blue laser
with high peak-power with 50% reduction in size and weight, thereby
circumventing many of the drawbacks of the more conventional approaches.
 NASA Langley Research Center has been actively pursuing coherent
Doppler wind LIDAR development for 3-D winds measurement for the last
fifteen years. The intensive research efforts have led to significant
advancement of a 2 -um laser transmitter, and the NASA team has recently
 demonstrated a Holmium- (Ho) and Thulium- (Tm) doped solid state laser
and amplifier at ~2um emission wavelength with 250 millijoules (mJ) per
pulse at a pulse repetition rate of 10 Hz [1] and a Ho:YLF slab
amplifier with 125 mJ at 350 Hz [2]. These are Holmium-based systems at
wavelengths slightly longer than 2 um. For some Navy applications such
as the aforementioned application in the blue spectral range, it is
desirable to use wavelengths shorter than 1.9 um. To cover this desired
wavelength range, further development of Tm-based solid-state lasers
with high peak-power and repetition rate is needed. It is therefore the
goal of this program to seek the development of a compact, ruggedized,
high energy, high repetition rate, 1.9 um, Thulium laser that will meet

Area Network Node Packaging",
        "description": "The Navy is interested in advancing built-in
test (BIT) capable digital avionics single-mode wavelength division
multiplexing (WDM) local area network (LAN) node technology. Combining
integrated active and passive WDM components with planar light-wave
circuits (PLCs), and integrated optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR)
 technology will create low cost, space, weight and power (SWAP) WDM
packaging technology for Department of Defense (DoD) aviation platforms.
 Application of BIT capable WDM technology on DoD aviation platforms
will enable a drastic increase in the aggregate transmission bandwidth
and network node connectivity, reliability and maintainability relative
to today\u2019s copper and single-wavelength fiber optic point-to-point
link designs. Current fiber optic systems utilizing single wavelength
point-to-point links limit the ability of the avionics designer to
maximize network redundancy, reliability, and maintainability, while
minimizing the number of onboard interconnects. This fundamental
limitation of point-to-point fiber optic links for high speed digital
data transmission points directly towards WDM technology as a viable
solution. The inherent speed and latency advantages of optical
communication in future designs trend toward ultra-high speed fiber
optic WDM local area networking. The recent development of precision
fiber optic component connection and OTDR application specific
integrated circuit technologies and advancements in integration of
ruggedized digital WDM active components and avionics WDM LAN topologies
 point toward an innovative research program to integrate the various
components into functional packages for board level integration. It is
expected that WDM LAN technology will be incorporated in future
generation avionics architectures. In order to meet the needs of
military avionics, the Navy is seeking innovative approaches for
creating WDM LAN nodes based on hybrid-integrated BIT capable
optoelectronic packages containing OTDR application-specific integrated
circuit (ASIC), tunable laser, wavelength converter, fixed and tunable
multiplexer\/de-multiplexer, planar lightwave circuit (PLC), and
advanced connection technology. Placing WDM LAN node components on a
printed circuit board enables easy insertion within avionics weapons
replaceable assemblies. This will advance technology readiness and thus
eliminate apprehension on the part of avionics integrators to adopt WDM
LAN technology in next generation designs. Successful development could
also result in significantly reduced WDM LAN component packaging cost.
Final packaged solutions including all electronic interface circuitry
shall meet the following SWAP requirements. Size: Package height shall
be less than 8 mm Threshold \/ 5 mm Objective. Package footprint shall
be less than 100 cm2 Threshold \/ 50 cm2 Objective. Mass: Package mass
shall be less than 1000 grams Threshold \/ 500 grams Objective. Power:
Package shall require less than 12 W of electrical power (including
cooling if needed) to meet Phase II routing objectives.\n\nPHASE I:
Develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a hybrid-integrated WDM LAN
node package. Simulate the in-package optical routing for ring, bus,
star and mesh topologies, including the performance over expected
optoelectronic package assembly tolerances. Include plan to meet SWAP
requirements.\n\nPHASE II: Develop a manufacturable prototype of the WDM
 LAN node package designed in Phase I. Demonstrate four optical
input\/outputs each supporting a minimum of 4 C-band 100 GHz spaced
wavelengths per input and output port at a minimum of 10 gigabits per
second per wavelength with a bit error rate no greater than 10E-12. Test
 both device components and the package over a -40 to +100 Celsius
temperature range. Phase II has the potential to be classified, the
contractor will need to be prepared for personnel and facility
certification.\n\nPHASE III: Increase manufacturing readiness and

Subsurface Residual Stresses in Turbo-machinery Components",
        "description": "Compressive surface treatments are frequently
used in turbo-machine components to add a factor of safety to their
component life. The residual stress (RS) profile that is imparted to
metallic components can vary by application, service use, time, and
environment. The US Navy is interested in non-destructively measuring
the subsurface residual stress field in metallic engine components,
specifically in titanium and Inconel\u00ae alloys. The current industry
standard for measuring RS is x-ray diffraction (XRD) which is limited to
 measuring surface stresses. In order to measure subsurface stresses
with XRD, the component must be destructively evaluated. Because of
this, a subsurface stress for a production component is unable to be
confirmed except for the few candidates used for quality assurance. Even
 when these candidates are analyzed, XRD-measured RS does not correlate
well with the design model showing the difficulty in modeling subsurface
 stress. Extensive measurements of surface RS have been performed during
 recent years confirming that surface RS relaxes at critical locations
of engine components with operational usage. These components are
designed to initially have compressive RS at key locations; however, as
the RS relaxes with usage, it may approach a tensile condition and the
component no longer benefits from the intended factor of safety. An NDI
system that provides quantitative, subsurface measurements of RS at
critical locations of turbo-machinery components of the propulsion
system is sought. Such technology will provide the ability to implement
subsurface stresses to a design model, confirm that the design intent
was met, as well as offer the ability to actively monitor the life
remaining for a component due to operational stress relaxation. Critical
 components of concern include fans, disks, and blisks\/integrally
bladed rotors (IBR). Critical locations tend to be inside surfaces of
bolt-holes, bores, slots and fillet radii.\n\nIn order to be a valuable
design tool, the new NDI device must be capable of the
following:\n\n\u2022 Resolving stress within 10% of actual stress value
(emphasis will be placed on method of validation);\n\u2022 Resolving
stress location within 10% of modeled local mesh size;\n\u2022
Discerning stress values in each element of the model used to life the
component;\n\u2022 Results for stress magnitude and location should be
repeatable to less than 10%, using ASTM F1469 as a guideline;\n\u2022
Through component measurement for typical gas turbine engine components
is desired. The ability to measure residual stress at depths customary
to advanced surface treatments (~0.150 inches) is necessary. Components
can be moved or manipulated to achieve this requirement;\n\u2022
Measuring Titanium- or Inconel\u00ae-based alloys common to cold section
 components with ability to expand to other materials;\n\u2022 Producing
 a favorable return on investment;\n\u2022 And be safe for the
user.\n\nAttributes such as time per measurement, measurement
environment and system size should be addressed. Time per measurement
and system size should be minimized as much as possible while the
measurement environment should be practical (e.g., humidity, component
cleanliness, etc.) The ability to quantify the percentage of each grain
orientation (e.g., 100, 111 planes) for cubic and hexagonal structures
in a specific volume and discern the stress of a specific orientation is
 not required but would be encouraged. The desire for this solicitation
is to develop a technology with the ability to measure subsurface
stresses for use in component design, and the ability to be developed
into a manufacturing quality control tool as well as a portable, field
inspection device. Establishing a working relationship with relevant
original engine manufacturer(s) (OEM), while not required, will greatly
enhance probability of success.\n\nPHASE I: Demonstrate feasibility and
proof-of-concept of proposed NDI system capable of quantitatively,
nondestructively and reliably measuring and tracking surface and
subsurface RS at critical locations of turbo-machinery components.
Provide preliminary design for a system.\n\nPHASE II: Develop, produce,
validate and implement a robust and rugged NDI RS measurement prototype
system based on the results of Phase I. The prototype should be capable
of obtaining the necessary subsurface RS data nondestructively and
tracking it for comparative analyses during the life cycle of each
individual component. Integrate the system to develop life management
methodology and validate life management algorithms for application to
be used on engine components. Provide detailed design for a system.
Perform a demonstration of the developed NDI system.\n\nPHASE III:
Mature the system for field use by making the system robust, rugged and
ensuring ease of use for the operator in both Navy and commercial
applications. Perform any final testing and commercialize and transition
 the technology for field and Original Equipment Manufacturer usage.",

capability gaps exist in inspections of component preforms thicker than
approximately 3". Uncertainty remains around the probability of
detection, minimum detectable flaw size, and resolution of
non-destructive inspections (NDI) on typical flaws found in additive
manufacturing (AM) materials. Improved standards are needed to down
select and optimize specific NDI techniques (X-ray, computed tomography

        "topic_name": "Innovative, High-Energy, High Power, Light-Weight
 Battery Storage Systems Based on Li-air, Li-sulfur (Li-S) Chemistries",
        "description": "As the Navy modernizes its Fleet, the energy
needs of naval aircraft are increasing significantly. Meeting the energy
 demands of these aircraft is a formidable challenge which requires
looking beyond current Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. The
state-of-the-art Li-ion cells have a theoretical specific energy of 387
Wh\/kg (watt hour\/kilogram) and energy density of about 1015 Wh\/L
(volumetric energy density), respectively. The specific energy of the
Li-ion cells are attractive because, in comparison to nickel-cadmium and
 lead-acid batteries, Li-ion batteries offer significant advantages
\u2013 decreased weight (~1\/3) and increased capacity (~3X). The
decrease in weight would result in cost savings due to lower fuel
consumption during flight or the ability to increase payload, which
increases mission capability. Li-air and Li-S are two emerging
chemistries that can meet such energy demands. There are two types of
rechargeable Li-air batteries undergoing research, namely, non-aqueous
and aqueous systems. The theoretical specific energy for the non-aqueous
 system (organic electrolyte based) is 3505 Wh\/kg and the theoretical
energy density is about 3436 Wh\/L, which are about ten times greater
than the Li-ion cells. The corresponding parameters for the aqueous
systems are 3582 Wh\/kg and 2234 Wh\/L, respectively, which are also
approximately ten times greater than the Li-ion cells [1]. The Li-sulfur
 cells have a theoretical specific energy of 2567 Wh\/kg with a
theoretical energy density of 2200 Wh\/L. Each component of the
non-aqueous Li-air battery faces unique technical challenges. For
example, dendrite formation on the Li metal anode raises safety concerns
 that impact the capacity retention of the cell and contribute to
voltage gap during cycling process. One of the challenges for the
aqueous type Li-air is the requirement of a Li-ion conducting membrane
to protect the Li metal. The polysulphide solubility is a concern for
the Li-S batteries [1-3]. These challenges lead to low specific energy
and poor cycling efficiency for the current Li-air and Li-sulfur
systems. Combinations of material innovations and advancement in
obtaining stable interfaces are key to solving such challenges.
Disruptive new Li-air and Li-S concepts have the potential to increase
cycle life, round trip efficiency, and power density from their current
levels which are critical to the development of reliable next-generation
 battery chemistry technologies. The purpose of the topic is to develop
28V (Volt) DC (Direct Current) \/ 270 VDC electrical energy storage
devices based on emerging chemistries such as Li-air and Li-S. The
offerors must demonstrate the minimum specific energy for Li-air cells
in the range of 600-1000 Wh\/kg or higher (at least 3X higher than
Li-ion cells) or in the range 400 \u2013 800 Wh\/kg for Li-S cells. The
offerors must propose innovative approaches to overcome the challenges
mentioned above to achieve the defined threshold values with the goal of
 approaching theoretical energy density as objective values. The battery
 system to be developed (28V \/ 270V DC) must be stable under aircraft
operational, environmental, electrical, and safety requirements governed
 by applicable government documents [4-5]. The requirements include, but
 are not limited to, sustained operation over a wide temperature range
from -40 deg (degrees) C (Celsius) to +71 deg C, including exposure to
+85 deg C and the ability to withstand carrier based shock and vibration
 loads, altitude range up to 65,000 ft (feet), per MIL-STD-810G [6], and
 electromagnetic interference of up to 200 V\/m (Volts Per Meter), per
MIL-STD-461F [7]. Proposed innovative pathways must meet additional
requirements of low self-discharge (&lt; 5% per month), good cycle life
(&gt; 2000 cycles at 100% Depth of discharge (DOD)), and long calendar
life (4-7 years' service life) at cell level (threshold) and at battery
product level (objective). The diagnostic\/prognostic capabilities of
the system that will lead to developing a safer, reduced total ownership
 cost functional product should also be addressed.\n\nPHASE I: Design
and develop an innovative concept to address low specific energy and low
 cycle life and demonstrate the feasibility of Li-air and or Li-S
battery at full-cell level. Perform critical safety and electrical
performance evaluations of Li-air and\/or Li-sulfur batteries.\n\nPHASE
II: Develop a prototype and demonstrate the functionality of a Li-air
and\/or Li-S battery over a wide-temperature range, under select harsh
environmental, storage, and cycling conditions. In addition, initiate
the scale-up and design processes and develop preliminary cost
structure.\n\nPHASE III: The functional aircraft-worthy prototype
battery product should be developed with performance specifications
satisfying targeted acquisition requirements coordinated with Navy
technical point of contacts. Complete testing per military performance
specifications and transition to appropriate platforms (Ex. F\/A-18E\/F,
 F-35 etc.). Commercialize the Li-air, Li-S battery technology and

Rotorcraft Regime Recognition Algorithms",
        "description": "Due to practical, technical, and logistical
limitations associated with achieving direct loads monitoring for every
fatigue sensitive component on an aircraft, the Navy is relying on
flight maneuver recognition to provide usage data across a fleet of
aircraft in order to refine fatigue life calculations. However, current
RR tools have trouble accurately and precisely recognizing flight
regimes. These existing RR tools are based off of empirical or
rule-based systems. They are derived from actual flight tests, which
makes them vehicle-, load out-, weather-, and pilot- dependent. In
addition, their development is costly and time-consuming, since each air
 vehicle system and maneuver type must be individually flight tested and
 verified against the RR code. As a result, RR codes do not have the
accuracy required for fleet usage in HUMS. It is therefore important to
verify that future RR codes for use in rotorcraft applications correctly
 represent as many flight conditions as possible. In order to ensure the
 fitness of RR tools, per ADS-79D-HDBK, new RR codes require an
independent verification and validation (IV&amp;V) effort. Current
verification of RR tools is performed by manually comparing the input of
 physical flight test data to the RR tool\u2019s output. This process is
 often labor intensive and error prone. Without an automatic and
standardized way of comparing codes, selecting the \u2018best\u2019 code
 can be a subjective process. Automating the validation process would
not only expedite the process considerably, it would also allow for the
quantitative comparison of RR codes. The use of physics-based simulation
 to recreate a set of validation test flights can reduce flight test
costs and streamline the RR validation process. Despite their present
shortcomings, an effective RR code would be invaluable for tracking
fatigue damage to parts through the accurate detection and measurement
of flight regimes experienced by a rotorcraft. RR schemes have many
other possible benefits to rotorcraft operations, including updating
service usage spectrums, as well as component damage tracking. These
improvements could drastically reduce unscheduled maintenance and
downtime. An automated validation tool which leverages physics-based
simulation that will provide validation of RR codes, be fast, simple to
use, and provide feedback on the accuracy of the RR tool\u2019s
identification of regimes is sought. This validation tool should be able
 to identify codes that capture at least 97 percent of maneuvers, or
sufficient maneuvers in order to not under-predict the fatigue damage
fraction of life-limited parts by more than 0.5 percent. The tool should
 alert users to inconsistencies between the outputs of the RR code and
the performed maneuvers. The validation tool should use scripted HUMS
flights on instrumented aircraft.\n\nPHASE I: Design and develop a
model\/concept for a physics-based tool for the automatic validation of
rotorcraft RR software. Demonstrate the feasibility of the
approach.\n\nPHASE II: Provide practical implementation of the
methodology developed in Phase I and incorporate it into a prototype
tool which includes a suitable graphical user interface (GUI). The

 platform and mission load out. Improve the accuracy, robustness, and
speed of the tool to help spur the development of more robust RR codes.
Demonstrate the developed prototype tool with scripted HUMS flights on
instrumented aircraft and eventually streaming data from a flight
simulator.\n\nPHASE III: Transition and integrate the validation tool
into a software package for use with RR code outputs obtained from
actual flight data from onboard a Navy\/Marine helicopter. Perform field
 testing to demonstrate the robustness of the system when dealing with
real flight data. Expand the tool to be able to analyze code for actual
production platforms (e.g. H-53E\/K, H-60R\/S, and H-1) and different

        "topic_name": "Ultra-High Temperature (UHT) Sensor Technology
for Application in the Austere Environment of Gas Turbine Engines",
        "description": "Current blade health monitoring sensors are
capable of operating at 1100\u00b0F continuously uncooled, and have been
 demonstrated to work up to 1800\u00b0F with cooling. Use of compressor
air for sensor cooling would adversely impact the cycle efficiency and
potentially produce case distortion, and hence, a need exists to develop
 uncooled sensors that can operate in a +2500\u00b0F environment in the
aft end of the turbo machinery. Design progression also alludes to a
high-temperature need in the compression system. Current developmental
and future engines for Department of Defense (DoD) propulsion systems
will need to operate at high efficiencies to meet the mission-weighted
fuel burn (MWFB) requirements. This means that engines operate with
tighter running clearances, increased blade loading and at substantially
 higher temperatures. As these designs have matured, high cycle fatigue
(HCF) failures have become a more common problem. Engine structural
integrity program (ENSIP) criteria (MIL-HDBK-1783B, A.4.13.3) was
modified to state that components shall have a minimum HCF life of 10^9
cycles (up from 10^7) and must be designed to 40% of the endurance limit
 (down from 60%); however, these contemporary design standards are still
 lacking in their ability to mitigate HCF failures. As a result, broader
 design margins are required to mitigate safety risks. Mission
requirements for enhanced propulsion system performance and reduced fuel
 burn present significant design challenges for original engine
manufacturers (OEM\u2019s). An effective method to increase performance,
 while decreasing weight and specific fuel consumption (SFC), is to
dramatically increase compression ratio and use fewer, more efficient
stages. These increased compression ratios directly translate to
increased temperatures which exacerbate the HCF issues. There is a need
to understand the temperature environment in which these airfoils
operate to better assess the impact to dwindling HCF margins due to
thermal effects on fatigue and endurance capabilities. Current
developmental and future engines are expected to see increased creep
incidents due to rising engine stresses and temperatures. With larger
stresses present inside engines, creep can occur at lower temperatures
(cold creep) and may appear more prevalent in the cold sections of
engines, although creep has traditionally been classified as a hot
section issue. There exists a need to understand the impact of
degradation mechanisms such as HCF, cold creep and others on material
capabilities during engine operation. Important aspects of a sensor
system for this environment to consider are footprint, overall
ruggedness, and practicality of system-engine interface. An onboard
diagnostic system must be of compact geometry and maintain a minimum
weight. Should a system utilize line of sight probes requiring ports
through the engine casing, said ports should also be minimized in size
and number. An onboard system will be subjected to engine vibration,
debris in gas path and possible perturbations from bypass air (on a
turbofan engine). The vibration experienced by the engine case and the
rotor is not necessarily in unison so the system must be able to discern
 blade vibration due to foreign or domestic object damage (FOD or DOD)
or HCF from other vibratory noise such as that from relative motion
between case and rotor. Ideally, the system must be structurally
ruggedized to withstand the vibrations and loads of an operating
aircraft, debris that may be in the flow path and the high-speed
airflow. Currently we work with probes that are 1\/2 to 1\/4 inches in
diameter, and just over 1 inch in length. There is no current upper
bound on weight, however one must consider that weight is a premium in
aircraft design and the more light-weight a design is the more
attractive it is as a solution. These probes penetrate engine cases and
today we would like to see innovation in decreasing these penetrant
sizes. Of course, an innovative design proposal that challenges our
concepts of probe construction and functionality is welcomed. It is
highly recommended, though not required, that the collaboration with
original equipment manufacturers be maintained throughout this
development.\n\nPHASE I: Design and demonstrate the feasibility of an
UHT in-situ engine sensor system at temperatures in the region of
2500\u00b0F and as cited in the Description section. Proof of concept
demonstrating the system\u2019s ability to identify and report airfoil
high cycle fatigue and FOD\/DOD events in real time, at elevated
temperatures, is necessary. Operating in austere engine environments
should be given serious consideration in this phase\n\nPHASE II: Based
on Phase I effort, further develop and test in-situ engine sensor system
 prototype. Rig testing should be conducted to elevate technology
readiness level (TRL) to an appropriate level for a representative
demonstration (a minimum TRL level of 4 is expected). The system should
ultimately demonstrate robustness in design and function for successful
operation in a representative environment. Conceptual design for the
final system configuration should also be completed.\n\nPHASE III:
Ruggedize the design and perform required operational testing.

Mission Processing Architecture for Next Generation Rotorcraft Avionics
Environment",
        "description": "Most avionics systems for rotorcraft currently
rely on a federated mission computer\/processing architecture which
centralizes the aggregation of data for processing and subsequent Human
Machine Interface (HMI)\/subsystem transmission. Current Rotocraft
Federated architecture habitually claims redundancy by having a
secondary processing computer that is either fully capable, or has a
reduced situational awareness (S\/A) capability giving the operators a
'fly home' mode upon failure of the primary processing unit. This
architecture has resulted in development of high cost mission computers,
 $200K-$400K\/unit, requiring multi-million dollar investments by the
government. This centralized processing system worked in the past as
power usage was lower; however, newer systems using commercial off the
shelf (COTs)\/government off the shelf (GOTs) processing boards in a 3U
and 6U format are high speed\/high power creating the need for heat
rejection &gt;200W for a relatively small surface area which is expected
 to increase as more video intensive processing is introduced with the
Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) II\/III based tracking and digital
 map systems. As part of this effort, an evaluation of the integration
of COTs\/GOTs systems vs custom design needs to be investigated to
optimize the processing profile. This system should be fault tolerant,
capable of losing up to 50% of the processing nodes while maintaining
full situational awareness (S\/A) across 4 Extended Graphics Array\/High
 Definition (XGA\/HD) (720 and 1080p) displays, processing map, digital
video and A\/C sensors. Additionally it should have a singular nodal
processing system of at least 3 nodes with a documented expandability
limit, a unit cost 20% or less of existing mission computers which cost
$200,000 - $300,000. Another systems integration based point to consider
 is that the majority of aircraft avionics systems are designed for a
1553B daisy chain architecture for digital data transfer. New, higher
speed systems rely more on a hub\/spoke architecture with designated
relay points (i.e., Ethernet) which drive physical integration issues
based on the eight (8) wires necessary for connection between each node
vs two (2) wires for legacy wired communications systems, i.e., 1553 and
 serial. Modular Open Systems Architecture (MOSA) and the Future
Airborne Computing Environment (FACE) will be required for the majority
of Avionics components in the future. While a MOSA computing environment
 should be achievable, there has been some debate about the ability to
utilize an abstraction layer and maintain a true Real-Time processing
environment. This issue should be addressed in the design of this
system, identifying roadblocks to full FACE conformance and potential
mitigations. This architecture could be utilized as a host
architecture\/framework for next generation Jet Engine controls, serving
 as the enabling functions for a dynamic distributed controls system if a
 the flight critical level of reliability and signal integrity is
achieved during this effort.\n\nPHASE I: Determine the technical
feasibility of distributed avionics architecture, identifying any
technological breakthroughs necessary to meet the high-uptime system
requirements and distributed processing stability.\n\nPHASE II: Produce a
 prototype mission processing architecture validating the proposed
design from Phase I that is capable of being certified for flight. The
actual certification process need not be completed for this phase but a
high degree of confidence that the hardware qualification required for a
 Safety of Flight or Mission Critical System will be achieved.
Demonstrate full functionality, automatically without operator
intervention, when one of the nodes is disabled.\n\nPHASE III: Produce a
 set of Production Representative Units PRU's (pre Low Rate Initial
Production LRIP units) for retrofit integration into an AH-1Z utilizing
the existing monolithic software running on an existing rotorcraft
platform demonstrating the ability to process the existing software in
at least three separate, fully redundant nodes. Commercial applications,

        "description": "Island bases and other remote forward operating
bases (FOB) have limited land and energy resources to dispose of
municipal solid waste (MSW). Open air pits are discouraged and
congressionally required to be nearly-eliminated. Due to the high volume
 of generated MSW and limited amount of real-estate, landfills and
bio-digestive approaches are impractical. Incinerators currently being
used require expensive, complex scrubbers in order to meet air quality
standards. Existing incinerators in use also consume excessive amounts
of fuel (diesel or JP8) and require waste characterization and sorting
to ensure proper operation. On island bases and other remote FOB\u2019s,
 fuel is costly to import - not only in monetary value, but manpower and
 lives as well. Current DoD waste disposal practices for contingency
bases involves trucking away waste or bringing in additional fuel to
burn the waste, which adds to the transportation burden and increases
risk to personnel. An Army Environmental Policy Institute (AEPI) study
reported than a soldier or civilian was wounded or killed for every 24
fuel resupply convoys in Afghanistan during FY 2007 [2]. Thermal
approaches to MSW disposal are sought that would generate energy in the
form of a fuel, useful thermal energy, or electrical energy. The goal is
 to achieve net zero consumption of energy in the disposal of MSW, while
 meeting air quality standards (see Ref 6). However as a minimum the
results of this project must show quantifiable improvement in energy
consumption. The new incinerator system must be simple to operate and
maintain in all climate conditions. The system must be able to be setup
and operational within 24hrs. Fuel or energy generation must be produced
 within 24 hours of operation. Typical thermal approaches that may be
considered in developing the incinerator system include but are not
limited to: combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, and thermal
depolymerization. Plasma arc gasification concepts should address energy
 intensity of the process, include simplicity and robustness of the
hardware to be used. Bio-approaches are not ideal, but will be
considered. Any bio or chemical system must be robust and capable of
functioning in all global climate conditions. GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS:
The proposed incinerator system, when developed into a working system,
should meet the following logistics foot print and capacity: For
transportability to remote island bases or FOB, as well as ease of
assembly, the system should be contained in TRICON size containers that
can be reassembled and dismantled like modular building blocks. Each
TRICON must weigh not more than 10,000 lbs, the maximum capacity of the
material handling equipment within the Naval Mobile Construction
Battalion\u2019s Table of Allowance. The system should be contained in
no more than eight TRICON containers. The proposed incinerator system
should be able to deliver at least a 95% reduction in volume of waste,
be flexible in handling solid waste to include food, waste oil, and damp
 wood or vegetation. The system should be able to handle at least
1200lbs of waste a day and be able to be operated with a minimum of two
personnel. Effluents and any char from the process needs to be
environmentally safe for easy disposal. The system must be able to be
setup and operational within 24hrs. Fuel or energy generation must be
produced within 24 hours of operation. PHASE I: Determine feasibility of
 developing a portable incinerator system capable of MSW disposal with
the goal of achieving net zero energy consumption while meeting air
quality standards. Provide simulation and design plans for fabrication
of working prototype waste disposal incinerator system. Laboratory scale
 demonstration would be desirable but not required as a Phase I
deliverable. PHASE II: Fabricate and demonstrate a fully functioning
incinerator system prototype with measurable energy consumption
improvement. The measurable improvement should be close to or at the
goal of net zero energy consumption. Air quality measurement will be
tested to quantify emissions. Prototype system should be delivered,
sized and fitted into TRICON containers, meeting specifications as
discussed in the Description section. PHASE III: Based on the results of
 Phase II, the small business will manufacture an incinerator system
with measurable energy consumption improvement close to or at the goal
of net zero energy consumption and transition the system for Navy use in
 an operationally relevant environment. The small business will support
the Navy with testing and validation of the system to certify and
qualify it for Navy use. A system capable of handling a small 150 man
camp will be field tested and evaluated. Standard MSW will be consumed
with targeted &amp;gt;95% reduction in volume. Portability and ease of
setup will be evaluated. The primary application will be fixed
facilities at remote Naval locations. Simple system operation and
maintenance will also be considered in evaluating possible wider DoD
implementation.",

would expedite test and validation of the benefits provided by a
microgrid in actual facilities test platforms. A modular approach would
also result in standardization and high volume such that economy of
scale and better reliability could be achieved than low volume
production. The envisioned power controller would be analogous to a
network router, be modular and expandable such that each controller
shall be able to communicate with one another in a mesh-type network
with cyber security features. Each power controller would be
plug-and-play such that standard types of power generators such as PV
and DC battery backup, grid connection, and loads can be detected and
managed with minimal configuration. A modular approach would mean that
the capacity of each controller may be small with a few controlling the
power on a building but in sufficient aggregate the mesh of controllers
would be able to manage a large base. Power would be transferred between
 buildings through existing power distribution lines. This would require
 integrated medium voltage solid state transformers in the power
controller. Proposals should focus on hardware design, cyber security,
and networking functionality of the concept in order to achieve desired
results.\n\nPHASE I: Phase I should address hardware, cyber security,

 for a solid state power converter capable of bidirectional power
conversion with connection directly to the distribution line
(4kV-7.5kV). The hardware should meet safety requirements for connection
 to the utility grid at medium voltage and be islandable. Cyber security
 solutions should address implementation of metering and controls that
meet DoD Information Assurance Certification Approval Process. Also
identify a design and concept for a modular hardware architecture to
house the controls that would be universal and compatible with third
party microgrid converters. Approaches for mesh network algorithms
should be developed and simulation of aggregate functionality performed

Energy Storage",
        "description": "Improvements in the manufacturing of power
density, power quality, and efficiency in power and energy management
and control are needed by the Navy to meet power and energy demands and
allow for future mission growth. The Navy is seeking to foster the
development of common, affordable electrical components and systems that
 could have broad application to ships. Electrochemical storage
(battery) cells have designs which do not lend themselves to effective
thermal management. For planar and cylindrical cells, the axes which
offer the maximum surface area are those which offer the greatest
thermal resistance. This is due to the nature of the design, which is
effectively a layered structure of polymer, metal and some thin chemical
 coatings, all wetted in an organic electrolyte. Developing a cooling
system at the in-plane direction of the conductors may result in better
thermal regulation from the use of tab and bussing connections, as well
as vents, sensors, and others which are often tied to the cell-ends,
particularly by leveraging thermal regulation internal to the cells
under high rate transient conditions (ref #1). Cooling of the
out-of-plane surfaces would likely still be used in combination with the
 innovative new system. The objective of this effort is to optimize use
of the busbar for cooling, given its intimate contact with the
conductors internal to the cell, as well as its mass and necessity to be
 routed throughout battery modules for electrical conductivity (ref #2).
 Typically, batteries are electrically connected to one another through
busbars or similar buswork. And, typically, the main purpose of the
busbars is to conduct current with minimal resistance. However, in this
work, an advanced busbar for innovative thermal control and enhanced
electrical performance is desired. The system will have to include the
capability to circulate a cooling medium for optimized thermal control.
Buswork developed should allow for integration on any battery module,
thus the technologies proposed should be scalable from small 10Ah type
cells through 60+Ah large format cell designs. Proposed approaches can
be passively or actively operational and must consider the flow of
cooling media and electrons in terms of media selection, system
continuity, and failure modes. Technologies developed for this specific
application will also be explored for applicability to electric power
distribution buswork, such as those used in switchboards. Technologies
proposed under this effort should not contain precious or hazardous
materials, nor require significant deviation from a typical battery
system design (such as cells placed in a geometric array and connected
in series). It is optimal for these devices to operate such that chilled
 water is not required, though glycol\/water mixtures can be assumed to
be available at 40 degrees C, with sufficient flow available to meet
mission needs. Ambient spaces should be assumed to be up to 60 degrees C
 and battery maximum operational temperatures should also be assumed to
be 60 degrees C. In order to maintain density of the energy storage
devices, the proposed approaches should not increase the cell length
over 50% beyond the commonly accepted value for bussing for a specific
ampacity associated with the cell\u2019s maximum rating. If a special
cooling fluid is to be utilized, the interface to shipboard cooling
fluid should be considered, along with the impact on efficiency and
device\/system density and packaging size. The end intent is to utilize
this design as part of a tightly-packaged battery system, complete with
thermal management, monitoring, fire suppression and requisite safety
devices; the innovative approach proposed under this solicitation would
serve as the connectivity between cells in battery modules of different
sizes and ratings.\nProposed buswork concepts should meet the following

of the concept in meeting Navy needs for an innovative modular bus bar
cooling system and will establish that the concept can be feasibly
developed into a useful product for the Navy. The company will prove the
 concept of external, axial heat transfer in-plane with the current flow
 and identify performance advantages. Proof of concept will be
demonstrated on a small cell or cells, which can be cycled in a manner
suitable to create sufficient internal heating, and compared to a
control approach. The proof of concept should also be demonstrated on
cycling cells or integrated into a battery versus a control of the same

business will develop a Phase II prototype for evaluation. The prototype
 will be evaluated to determine its capability in meeting the
performance goals defined in Phase II Statement of Work (SoW) and the
Navy need for improved thermal management, in this case, via an
innovative modular bus bar cooling system for energy storage with high
rate heat removal that leverages the thermal mass and conductivity of
bussing systems. The company will demonstrate the cooling device to
support an arrangement of cells at the 48V module level. The prototype
design should provide no less than 10Ah (threshold), 30Ah (objective),
and should show applicability to be utilized with various cell
geometries and battery architectures. The company will deliver a minimum
 of five of these prototypes to the Navy for evaluation. The Company
will perform detailed analysis to ensure materials are rugged and
appropriate for Navy application. Environmental, shock, and vibration
analysis will also be performed.\n\nPHASE III: The company will apply
the knowledge gained in Phase II to build an advanced module, suitably
packaged with 1000VDC strings of cooled batteries, including battery
management system, and characterize its performance at high discharge
rates as defined by Navy requirements. Working with the Navy and
applicable Industry partners, demonstrate application with the bus bar
cooling system to be implemented within shipboard and\/or land-based
test site to support energy storage or other applications. The company
will support the Navy for test and validation to certify and qualify the
 system for Navy use. The company shall explore the potential to
transfer the bus bar cooling system to other military and commercial
systems (electric grid, electric vehicles). Market research and analysis
 shall identify the most promising technology areas and the company
shall develop manufacturing plans to facilitate a smooth transition to

        "topic_name": "Navy Air Cushion Vehicles (ACVs) Lift Fan
Impeller Optimization",
        "description": "The Ship-to-Shore Connector (SSC), a replacement
 hovercraft for the existing fleet of Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC)
vehicles, utilizes a lift fan system to discharge air into the
craft\u2019s skirt and bow thrusters to lift the hovercraft under normal
 operation. Each SSC utilizes two identical lift fans which are defined
by an impeller and a volute assembly. Each lift fan impeller includes a
center disk, blades which are attached to both sides of the center disk,
 and two outer shrouds. Lift fan impeller blades are removable and
replaceable without requiring the disassembly of the lift fan system.
There is no commercial hovercraft of this scale and payload capacity.
The current SSC lift fans meet craft performance requirements, but the
SSC Program Office seeks the development of an advanced lift fan that
increases fan efficiency by at least 10% while achieving minimal noise
levels (125 db or less). Improvements in fan efficiency will increase
fuel economy. SSC lift fan performance will be enhanced when impeller
blade characteristics are optimized through their entire length. Current
 impeller blade characteristics, such as shape, and structure, affect
aerodynamic losses and efficiency of the impeller. However, studies
suggest (Ref. 1) conventional design methods, such as the streamline
curvature of the fan blades, do not adequately address aerodynamic
improvement. In addition, an extrusion manufacturing process used to
form impeller blades also inhibits the development of an optimum shape.
Each impeller blade includes a large attachment foot on each end of the
blade which disturbs flow and reduces efficiency and mass airflow. Each
inner lift fan impeller blade foot is attached to the fan center disk
through a series of bolted fasteners and each outer lift fan impeller
blade foot is attached to one of the two outer shrouds through a series
of bolted fasteners. Although, undergoing dimensional modifications and
other changes, the foot-to-blade transition area continues to negatively
 impact the aerodynamics within the lift fan system. This foot-to-blade
transition promotes flow separation along the blade, and may change the
angle in which the airflow is directed into the bow thruster and skirt
supply ducts, which affects the efficiency of the fan by approximately
3-4% (Ref. 1). Extending the blades radially outward and away from the
fastened area or a design which removes the footing while maintaining
structural integrity are a couple of ways the lift fan system could
achieve greater efficiency. Sweeping the blade shape may also improve
efficiency (Ref. 2), however, areas to consider that may be affected by
any changes to blade design are the blade leading and trailing edges,
maximal flow, and direction of flow. There are little commercial
alternatives to a Navy-grade centrifugal fan applied to an air-cushion
system. Due to this limited availability, all performance aspects will
be relative to legacy craft data and projected SSC estimates. The
overarching goals of this effort are the development of a cost-effective
 advanced lift fan blade design and manufacturing process that will
increase lift fan efficiency by at least 10% to optimize SSC fuel
efficiency and reduce noise; extend SSC mission range; and minimize SSC
production and life cycle costs. In addition, the Navy requires the
removal and replacement of fan blades without the removal of the
impeller from the SSC. The advanced lift fan impeller must meet the
Navy\u2019s fan specification (Ref. 3).\n\nPHASE I: The company will
define and develop a concept for a lift fan impeller that meets the
requirements as stated in the Description section above. The company
will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept through aerodynamic
modeling and analysis and show that the concept will provide a
cost-effective lift fan for the Navy with improved fan efficiency and
fuel economy. The company must also demonstrate the manufacturability of
 the fan. The concept must provide the capability for impeller blade
removal and replacement without removing the impeller from its installed
 location on the craft.\n\nPHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I
effort and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), the company will
develop a prototype lift fan impeller for evaluation. The prototype will
 be evaluated to determine its capability in meeting the performance
goals defined in the Phase II SOW and the Navy fan specification for
efficiency, noise, and vibration. System performance will be
demonstrated through installation and testing on SSC and by modeling and
 analysis. The fan must demonstrate increased fan efficiency (by at
least 10%) and reduced noise level (below 125 db). The prototype will
also need to be evaluated to ensure individual lift fan impeller blades
can be removed without removing the impeller from its installed location
 on the craft. Evaluation results will be used to refine the prototype
into an initial design that will meet the SSC Craft
Specifications.\n\nPHASE III: The company will be expected to support
the Navy in transitioning the lift fan impeller to Navy use on the SSC.
The company will finalize design and fabricate production prototype lift
 fan impeller, according to the Phase III SOW, for evaluation to
determine its effectiveness in an operationally relevant environment.
The company will support the Navy for test and validation in accordance
with SSC Craft Specifications to certify and qualify the system for Navy
 use and for transition into operational SSCs. Following testing and
validation, the end design is expected to produce results outperforming
the current SSC lift fan in regards to fan efficiency, air flow, and
noise reduction.",

        "topic_name": "Amphibious Combat Vehicle Ramp Interface Modular
Buoyant Kit (MBK) for Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV) Stern Ramp",
        "description": "The United States Marine Corps has advised the
Navy that it needs to develop a light weight kit that can be readily
attached to the JHSV\u2019s stern cargo ramp so that when the ramp is
lowered directly into the water it would allow AAVs and ACVs to be
launched and retrieved from the JHSV near the shore (splash-off). The
Marine Corps needs a high speed shallow draft connector that can launch a
 dozen or more AAVs\/ACVs within three miles from shore. These
amphibious vehicles do not carry sufficient fuel to enable them to carry
 out their assigned mission ashore if they are launched from deep draft
Amphibious Landing Ships positioned at a long standoff distance. The
Navy is seeking concepts that do not require significant modifications
to the ramp structure, but should rely instead on light weight discrete
systems to protect the ramp from sea state-induced motion and facilitate
 desired transfer operations. The Navy intends to develop a kit that
will permit the L&amp;R of Amphibious Vehicles close to shore from
shallow draft high speed JHSVs. The Navy seeks the development of an
innovative compact lightweight MBK that can be stored inside the
JHSV\u2019s vehicle bay. The MBK will serve as flotation to the current
JHSV stern ramp to facilitate launch and retrieval of the USMC ACVs and
AAVs (Ref 1) through full Sea State 3 (SS3) with significant wave
heights up to 1.25 meters without damaging the ramp. The primary purpose
 of the MBK will be to provide protection to the ramp from induced
relative motions from the sea. The MBK also needs to be designed to
accommodate the weight of the future Advanced Combat Vehicle (ACV) that
is projected to weigh approximately 30 short tons and will be
splash-launched directly into the sea via the stern cargo ramp and then
driven back up the ramp from the sea and aboard the JHSV. The current
stern cargo ramp that is installed in the JHSV has had structural
failures when operated above its specified design condition. The current
 JHSV stern cargo ramp is designed to support vehicle transfer through
SS1, flat seas up to 1 ft (Ref 2), during L&amp;R (Ref 3). Torsion is
particularly damaging to the JHSV ramp and its connections to the JHSV
structure at-sea transfers. JHSV or receiving platform motions may
impart dangerous accelerations to vehicles transiting the ramp. MBK
development should be focused upon satisfying requirements in a cost
effective manner. The MBK system should be portable enough to store in a
 Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit (TEU) meeting TEU tare weight restrictions
of 47.6k lbs and be easily transferred from the vehicle bay to the stern
 \u201cporch\u201d with standard shipboard cargo movement forklift or
similar gear. While JHSV does slow down to almost a complete stop prior
to unfolding and deploying the ramp, the MBK must be designed so that it
 can be prepared for use by shipboard personnel while the JHSV is
underway at speeds of up to 20 knots. As the ramp is being unfolded, the
 MBK should be designed to automatically position itself beneath the
ramp prior to the ramp being lowered into the water. The MBK must be
able to dynamically compensate for motion in SS3 while in use to ensure
safe L&amp;R. The MBK needs to be designed to operate in SS3 for the
worst case condition in which the vehicle is being driven along the edge
 of the ramp instead of right down the middle of the ramp. It needs to
be able to dynamically compensate for SS3 conditions using buoyancy,
configuration, and other innovative techniques to prevent damage to the
JHSV and the ACVs or AAVs during L&amp;R. The addition of the MBK should
 also have little to no effect on ramp deployment and retrieval time.
This will allow deployment of amphibious combat vehicles from the much
more affordable JHSV platform rather than the traditional delivery by
LPD 17 and Landing Craft Air Cushions (LCAC).\n\nPHASE I: The company
will develop concepts for an MBK to enable the JHSV stern ramp to be
used to launch and retrieve amphibious vehicles meeting the requirements
 described above. The company is expected to demonstrate the feasibility
 of its concepts through dynamic modeling and simulation to show that
the concepts avoid damage to the JHSV and amphibious vehicles during
splash-launch and recovery of heavy 30 ST loads in Sea State 3.
Feasibility demonstrations must show that ramp structural design limits
are not exceeded and that the cost of the MBK is affordable to the Navy;
 not more than $250K, however, the Navy seeks the most affordable
solution capable of meeting the technical requirements.\n\nPHASE II:
Based on the results of Phase I effort and the Phase II Statement of
Work (SOW), the company will develop a prototype MBK for evaluation. The
 prototype will be evaluated by scale model test, modeling, and
simulation to determine its capability in meeting the performance goals
defined in Phase II SOW and the Navy requirements listed in the
description for an innovative compact lightweight modular MBK. The MBK
prototype will be tested in the laboratory on a motion platform to
demonstrate that the MBK can accommodate amphibious launch and recovery
in Sea State 3 without exceeding the design limits of the JHSV and
without damage to the JHSV, the amphibious vehicles, or the
MBK.\n\nPHASE III: The company will be expected to support the Navy in
transitioning the technology for Navy use. The company will finalize
design and fabricate full scale production prototype for the JHSV stern
ramp, according to the Phase III SOW, for evaluation to determine its
effectiveness in an operationally relevant environment. If the MBK
successfully completes the relevant environment evaluation, the Navy
expects the company to support full-scale test and validation during a
Fleet Experiment to certify and qualify the system for Navy use.",

        "topic_name": "Modular Boat Ramp to Launch and Retrieve
Watercraft from Joint High Speed",
        "description": "The JHSV\u2019s boat crane does not have the
requisite man loading safety factor needed to allow the boat crew to
remain on board during L&amp;R. In order for small boats to debark from
the JHSV, they must enter the water using the boat crane without the
crew on board, and then the small boat must be positioned alongside the
JHSV in a coordinated effort by the crane operator and members of the
ship\u2019s crew using tag lines. After the small boat is secured
alongside the JHSV, a Jacobs Ladder must be rigged between the JHSV and
the small boat in order for the boat crew to climb into the small boat
and depart. In order to embark a small boat aboard the JHSV after
returning from a mission, the crane operator and members of the
ship\u2019s crew using tag lines must again position and secure the
small boat alongside the JHSV and rig the Jacobs Ladder so that the boat
 crew can climb back aboard the JHSV. This operational limitation of not
 allowing the crane to lift the boat while its crew is aboard creates a
safety concern whenever members of the boat crew are transferring
between the JHSV and their small boat using a Jacobs Ladder in Sea State
 3 or greater. This crane man loading restriction not only creates an
operational safety concern but significantly slows down the rate at
which small boats can be launched and retrieved from the JHSV.
Therefore, approaches that are safer and support higher rates of small
boat launch are being sought. The JHSV has a requirement to rapidly
L&amp;R a variety of manned and unmanned watercraft in full Sea State 3
(SS3) conditions with wave height of 3-5 feet (ref #1). The manned and
unmanned vehicles include 11 meter Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats (RHIB),
40 foot High Speed Boats (HSBs), SEAL Delivery Vehicles (SDVs), Unmanned
 Underwater Vehicles (UUVs), and 40 foot long endurance drones. This
watercraft have large length to beam ratios making them susceptible to
spinning about the axis formed between the crane\u2019s boom tip and
hook caused by motions imposed upon the JHSV from the sea. L&amp;R at
this scale is not done commercially and high volume of craft launch at
this weight is not done. The Navy has determined that the existing crane
 installed aboard the JHSV should only be used for moving cargo aboard
the JHSV from one place to another and that a different approach needs
to be undertaken for watercraft L&amp;R. To that end, this topic seeks
to develop an approach for watercraft L&amp;R that does not rely upon
using the crane installed aboard the JHSV. An approach involving the
development of an auxiliary ramp is being sought because that approach
appears to be both safer and capable of providing faster L&amp;R of
watercraft. If successful, the Navy will either fund a ship alteration
to modify the current stern cargo ramp or fund a ship alteration to
develop and install an additional light weight modular boat ramp between
 the existing crane and the cargo ramp for L&amp;R of watercraft from
the JHSV. The operational safety and the rate at which L&amp;R can be
performed become much worse as the Sea State increases from SS0 through
SS3. The crane installed on board the JHSV for this purpose has not
successfully demonstrated L&amp;R of watercraft above Sea State 2. Navy
is seeking an innovative new Modular Boat Ramp (MBR) system that could
be situated on the stern of the JHSV (ref #2). This system must be able
to L&amp;R manned 11 meter RHIBs SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV), or High
Speed Boat (HSB) through SS3, (ref #3) allowing the boat crew to remain
on board the RHIB during the entire L&amp;R cycle. This system should be
 readily adaptable for L&amp;R of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) and
UUVs in full SS3. The L&amp;R system should be designed so that it can
accommodate the launch or retrieval of all small crafts less than or
equal to 40 feet in length in less than 15 minutes in SS3. When the
system is fully operational, subsequent small crafts should be able to
be launched every 10 minutes and retrieved every 20 minutes. The maximum
 dimensions of the small boats that JHSV shall accommodate and L&amp;R
are as follows: a. Length: 12.32 m (40.41 ft.), b. Width: 2.74 m (9.00
ft.), c. Height: 2.72 m (8.92 ft.). The design and fabrication of the
system concept must be combatable to an all-aluminum vessel, comply with
 all applicable safety standards for manned boat operations, be readily
stowed aboard the JHSV\u2019s Vehicle Mission Bay (VMB), and be easily
transferable from the VMB at a location near the back porch area to
facilitate temporary installation of the system near the stern of the
JHSV. This effort also requires technologies that facilitate command and
 control of the system by both ship\u2019s force and the crew aboard the
 small boat. This L&amp;R system must also provide a manual backup mode
of operation permitting at sea capture and release of the small crafts
from the JHSV.\n\nPHASE I: The Company will develop a concept for a
Modular Boat Ramp (MBR) system that meets the requirements described
above. The company will conduct feasibility studies, including
hydrodynamic assessments of the system, and demonstrate the feasibility
of the operational Launch and Retrieval (L&amp;R) system concept via
physics-based modeling and simulation. Feasibility studies must show
that the MRB is affordable for the Navy; not more than $125K, however,
the Navy seeks the most affordable solution capable of meeting the
technical requirements.\n\nPHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and
 the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), the small business will develop a
 prototype MBR for evaluation. The prototype will be evaluated to
determine its capability in meeting the performance goals defined in the
 Phase II SOW and the Navy requirements for the Modular Boat Ramp (MBR).
 The MBR must be able to safely launch and retrieve both manned and
unmanned vehicles in SS3. The MBR must be a modular device capable of
L&amp;R times and vehicle size requirements described above in SS3 to
ensure the operational tempo of JHSV L&amp;R. System performance will be
 demonstrated through prototype evaluation and testing, modeling, and
analysis. The contractor will evaluate results and refine requirements
for the L&amp;R system.\n\nPHASE III: The company will support the Navy
in transitioning the MRB system for Navy use aboard JHSV and similar
vessels. The company will develop a full-sized MBR system in accordance
with their Phase III SOW for evaluation to determine its effectiveness
in an operationally relevant environment. The company will support the
Navy for test and validation to certify and qualify the system for Navy
use.",

        "topic_name": "Innovative Flexible Equipment Support
Infrastructure",
        "description": "US Navy Destroyers need an equipment support
infrastructure for several shipboard electronics and command spaces for a
 Common Processing System (CPS). The purpose of the flexible
infrastructure (FI) is to provide equipment configuration flexibility
and the ability to complete Command Center System modernization and
upgrades at reduced cost (by 30 to 60 percent ) (Ref 1) compared to
fixed-system modifications. Costs are associated with changes in
doctrine, organization, training, material, personnel, and facilities.
The innovative designs developed will allow the Navy to incorporate a
reconfigurable, modular support structure for large cabinets and
consoles in the remaining DDG 51 class ships as well as have it
considered for back fit in existing DDG 51 Class ships. DDG 51
Destroyers are continuously upgraded for numerous reasons including; new
 mission capability, response to new threats, or to add advanced
technology to increase reliability (Ref 2). These upgrades involve the
addition or substitution of new cabinets, displays, and electronics
resulting in long periods in shipyards for re-outfitting of support
structures in new configurations. During this time, ships are not
available for deployment. An infrastructure that will allow equipment
cabinets to be moved or replaced without welding would reduce
significant work in the upgrade package. Support structure cutting and
re-welding is labor intensive, time consuming, and very costly. The
current FI systems found on other ships are designed with very specific
bolt-hole patterns. Presently, DDG 51 Class cabinets and consoles do not
 align with the existing FI bolt-hole patterns and the solution so far
has been a heavy adapter plate. Although technically feasible, current
adapter plates are undesirable because they are very heavy, restrict
access for bolting, and protrude beyond the dimensions of the cabinet
causing a tripping hazard and increase the height of the cabinet. The
total height of the cabinets is limited to 75 inches, consequently, when
 the FI replaces the existing deck structure, it must not cause cabinet
height allowances to be exceeded. Increased height cannot be tolerated
without significant ship redesign of the existing deck heights. This
topic seeks innovative solutions to produce a light-weight, affordable,
and flexible support structure that can accommodate very heavy cabinets
and reduce installation costs by more than 30% in comparison to the
current legacy structure. Current FI systems used on other ships are
designed to handle cabinets of 150 pounds per square foot. A significant
 number of the cabinets on DDG 51 Class Destroyers are heavier than
this. Typical shipboard computer racks and cabinets are 19 inches wide
by 24 inches deep by 59.5 inches high (Ref 3) and weigh up to 2,000
pounds. While the FI must accommodate the weight of cabinets, it must
not add weight to the ship when it replaces the existing deck structure.
 It is anticipated, however, that by not utilizing the adapter plates
and potential use of lighter material for use in the flexible structure
itself, the overall flexible system will help in reducing the total ship
 weight. The design of any support infrastructures, adapter plates, or
modifications to the ship must meet ship specification requirements for
underwater shock (MIL-S-901D), EMI (MIL-S-461F), and safety (NAVSEA DDS
078-1). Additionally, modifications to the existing ship design need to
be minimal in order to prevent increased modification costs of ships to
deploy FI on new and existing ships. In addition, the FI must have
minimal weight and component costs and be easy to install.\n\nPHASE I:
The company will develop a concept for an affordable, innovative
equipment support structure that will meet the requirements described
above. The company will demonstrate the feasibility of the design
concept through material selection and testing, as well as, analytical
modeling and simulation with anticipated cost analysis. The
approach\/analysis should demonstrate the structural design has the
capability to meet load requirements at the same or reduced weight
compared to the existing deck structure.\n\nPHASE II: Based on the
results of Phase I and the Phase II Statement of Work (SoW), the company
 will develop prototype FI for evaluation. Prototype FI will be
evaluated to determine its capability in meeting the performance goals
defined in the Phase II SoW and the Navy requirements for a weight
neutral and innovative equipment support structure. The FI will be
evaluated in a mock-up of the CPS to ensure that it meets load,
re-configurability, height, cabinet mounting, and weight requirements.
Evaluation results will be used to refine the prototype FI into an
initial design that will meet Navy needs. Transition of the technology
for Navy use will include documentation that describes all installation,
 maintenance, and repair practices and procedures and meet Shock, EMI,
and safety requirements.\n\nPHASE III: The Navy expects the company to
support transition of the FI to Navy use aboard DDG 51 Class ships. The
company will produce production components for evaluation in the Combat
Information Center and the Combat Systems Equipment Room on board DDG 51
 to determine its effectiveness in an operationally relevant
environment. Additionally, the company will support the Navy for test
and validation to certify and qualify the system for Navy use.",

 local shape of an aircraft mold-line are desirable for future air
platforms to allow for a large sensor angle of regard. Conformal shapes
may have little to no symmetry depending upon their location. Spinel is
an excellent material candidate as it is both durable and multi-spectral
 (ultraviolet through mid-wave infrared). Spinel is more erosion
resistant than multispectral zinc sulfide, which is another logical
candidate for a large conformal window. The availability of blanks
currently limits the size and curvature for potential window
applications. The objective of this project is to develop and
demonstrate new manufacturing processes to provide near net shape blanks
 to improve upon current state of the art processes which start with a
thick, planar blank and grind them to the desired shape. Currently, the
thickness of the planar blank limits the maximum sag (height of window
from highest to lowest point) that can be obtained to approximately one
inch. Although actual shapes will be chosen by mutual agreement with the
 government, it is expected that the approximate conformal shape for
Phase II will be 16x16 inches with a sag of six inches. A small grain
spinel is preferred for enhanced strength, which is a desired property.
PHASE I: Demonstrate feasibility to manufacture near net shape conformal
 electro-optic sensor window blanks from spinel. To prove feasibility,
produce a minimum of two uncracked, fully dense spinel window blanks
having final fired dimensions of at least a 6x6inch footprint, sag of
three inches, and thickness of \u00bd inch. A toroid is a possible
demonstration shape. Measure the transmission spectrum of the material
using polished flat specimens cut from one of the window blanks. Desired
 transmission is within 4% of the theoretical value for spinel at a
wavelength of 0.63 microns and within 2% of the theoretical value for
spinel at a wavelength of 4 microns. PHASE II: Scale up to produce a
minimum of two uncracked, fully dense spinel window blanks having final
fired dimensions of at least a 16x16inch footprint, sag of six inches,

free-form shape mutually agreed upon with the government. Measure the
transmission spectrum and flexure strength of the material using
polished flat specimens cut from one of the window blanks. Desired
transmission is within 4% of the theoretical value for spinel at a
wavelength of 0.63 microns and within 2% of the theoretical value for
spinel at a wavelength of 4 microns. A material strength of greater than
 200MPa is desirable, as measured by ring-on-ring flexure testing. PHASE

Spinel is an excellent candidate window material as it is both durable
and multi-spectral (ultraviolet through mid-wave infrared). Spinel is
more erosion resistant than multispectral zinc sulfide, which is another
 logical candidate for a large conformal window. The objective for this
project is to create methods to grind and polish freeform conformal
sensor windows with dimensions up to 24x24 inches with a sag height of
approximately 8 inches and an optical precision of 0.5 micron or better.
 It is expected that methods will be developed with glass or fused
silica and that a full sized window will be made from glass or fused
silica. It is also possible that a full sized spinel blank may be
available from the government during this project. PHASE I: Demonstrate
the feasibility of grinding and polishing a glass or fused silica
conformal window with dimensions of 12x12 inches. The contractor shall
propose a shape with a window sag height of approximately four inches
and lacking rotational symmetry. The precise shape of the conformal
window will be selected by mutual agreement with the government. The
root-mean-square precision of the optical figure shall be 0.5 micron or
less with a clear aperture extending within half an inch from the edge.
PHASE II: Based on Phase I effort, scale up window fabrication with
glass or fused silica to lateral dimensions of 24x24 inches with a sag
of approximately eight inches. The shape shall be proposed by the
contractor with mutual agreement from the government. A root-mean-square
 precision of the optical figure of 0.5 micron or less with a clear
aperture extending within half an inch from the edge is desired. There
is a possibility that a spinel blank will be made available by the
government for Phase II. PHASE III: Implement commercial manufacturing
capabilities for large conformal windows made of durable ceramics such
as spinel. Manufacture an instrument for sale to optics manufacturers to
 make large, aggressively aspheric optics. Alternatively, provide a
commercial service to manufacture such optics.",

        "topic_name": "Accelerating Instructor Mastery (AIM)",
        "description": "Educators typically study for four years at a
university building a solid foundation of instructional knowledge. In
addition, most educators also have observed practical experience before
they instruct on their own. In contrast, active duty military
instructors often don\u2019t have the benefit of any education on how to
 instruct. They are often recently graduated students; although their
content knowledge is strong, they lack "expert instructor techniques"
(i.e., strategizing, executing, and adapting classroom instruction as
needed to achieve desired outcomes). Given the limited learning and
practice opportunities for military instructors, there is a need to
capture, explore, and practice military-specific best instructor
techniques in the schoolhouse, in order to enable and accelerate
effective and engaging instruction even by inexperienced instructors.
There are many different ways to possibly facilitate instructor
development outside of a traditional education setting. One method is to
 develop simulated environments. For example, TeachLivE is a mixed
reality environment that uses simulated students to help educators
practice their pedagogical skills. In this type of environment, the
scenarios can be tailored and scaffolding techniques can be provided to
support until the instructional skills are mastered [1]. Another method
is to facilitate peer collaboration. Enabling re-use and re-combinations
 of previously developed training material (e.g., documents, PowerPoint
slides, video, audio, practical exercises, etc.) allows instructors to
use, update, and further develop items that have proven effective in
similar training curricula. Similar approaches have been studied in
higher education, where teachers collaborate to generate content based
on knowledge about teaching with technology [2, 3]. It is unclear which
approach and systems would best facilitate and expedite learning and
development for inexperienced instructors. Outside of the civilian
traditional educational development model and system (e.g., 4-year
degree, professional conferences, etc.) there are limited technologies
and materials for inexperienced military educators \/ instructors to
effectively learn and practice pedagogical skills. Innovative solutions
are sought to address this gap in enhancing inexperienced instructor
capabilities among military populations. These capabilities should be as
 open source as possible, require a low \/ no manpower footprint, and be
 a tool that can be self-sustaining and extensible for wide variety of
military courses. PHASE I: Determine requirements for the development of
 software that provides capability to improve and accelerate the
development of novice instructors. Requirements for data collection
should include types of data and methods for easily capturing each type
of data. Phase I deliverables will include: (1) requirements for the
system components; (2) overview of the system and plans for Phase II;
and (3) mock-ups or a prototype of the system. If awarded, the Phase I
Option should also include the processing and submission of all required
 human subjects use protocols, should these be required. Due to the long
 review times involved, human subject research is strongly discouraged
during Phase I. Phase II plans should include key component
technological milestones and plans for at least one operational test and
 evaluation, to include user testing. PHASE II: Develop a prototype
system based on Phase I effort, and conduct a training effectiveness
evaluation. Specifically, military instructor performance areas will be
provided to support the development of the training effectiveness
evaluation. A near-term training need will be identified as a use case
for initial system development. All appropriate engineering tests and
reviews will be performed, including a critical design review to
finalize the system design. Once system design has been finalized, then a
 training effectiveness evaluation will be conducted with a Marine Corps
 population. Phase II deliverables will include: (1) a working prototype
 of the system that is able to interact with existing system
specifications and (2) training effectiveness evaluation of system
capabilities to provide demonstrable improvement to the instructor
population. PHASE III: If Phase II is successful, the company will be
expected to support the Marine Corps in transitioning the technology for
 Marine Corps use. The company will develop the software for evaluation
to determine its effectiveness in a Marine Corps formal school setting.
In addition, the small business will support the Marine Corps with
certifying and qualifying the system for Marine Corps use within the
Marine Corps Training Information Management System. As appropriate, the
 small business will focus on broadening capabilities and
commercialization plans.",

        "topic_name": "Reliability Centered Additive Manufacturing
Design Framework",
        "description": "Additive Manufacturing (AM) offers the
opportunity to fabricate equivalent (i.e. same fit\/form\/function)
structures and components in a more cost effective manner and in ways
that are not currently possible with subtractive, casting or other
manufacturing approaches. Unfortunately, today there are only a limited
number of AM components that can achieve complete equivalency to their
original counterparts which significantly limits the use of this
technology. Still, if the design space for AM parts is enlarged,
enormous benefits could be realized if we are able to incorporate
reliability, inspectability and repairability to those parts. By
explicitly exploiting some of the inherent AM material anisotropies
while minimizing or eliminating known AM weaknesses via effective
utilization of topological designs; material, microstructural and
functionally graded designs and other design space trade-offs, efficient
 and reliable structural or functional components can be fabricated.
Standing in the way for exploiting these seemingly endless design space
trade-offs is the ability to inspect and reliably assure operational
safety and performance of such advanced designs throughout the
operational life of these components. This SBIR topic is seeking
innovative approaches to monitor in-situ the reliability of complex AM
parts through their entire design life by including \u201creliability
assurance\u201d as an integral part of the design process and embedded
in the AM part itself. This topic is not interested in AM parts with
simple geometrical designs which could be inspected with existing
Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE)
equipment. Depending on the primary function of the AM part (such as
carrying structural load, thermal management, material transport, flow
control, signature control, etc.) the approach to ensure reliability
will vary. Other factors will also need to be considered when choosing
the approach such as part accessibility, part criticality, degree of
multi-functionality, AM method used to manufacture the part, AM material
 options and many others. Cost should also be a factor when down
selecting amongst several approaches that yield similar levels of safety
 and reliability. Addressing this topic in its entirety would require
resources beyond those available through a single SBIR program because
of the number of disciplines that need to be brought to bear. An AM
design framework that incorporates reliability throughout the life of
the component should integrate understanding and modeling of: 1 - the
different manufacturing technologies (SLA, SLS, SLM, FDM, EBM, EBF3,
etc.) used to manufacture AM parts; 2 - the materials, processing,
microstructure, property, defect types and distribution in the final AM
components; 3 - functional performance and progression (load bearing,
thermal management, material transport, EM); 4 - the development,
progression and criticality of damage in the AM parts; 5- the
interaction between the different damage types and the interrogation
method used to monitor part for integrity (such as ultrasonic,
electromagnetic, thermal, visual, etc.); 6 - as well as the reliability
of the monitoring approach itself. Therefore, to narrow the scope of
this SBIR topic, this solicitation will focus in only one AM technology
for metallic components. Also, \u201crepairability\u201d will only be
considered for implementation during Phase III if deemed necessary. The
Navy will only fund proposals that are innovative, address the proposed
R&amp;amp;D and involve technical risk. PHASE I: Develop a
Reliability-Centered AM Computational Design Framework (RCAM CDF) that
incorporates a specific AM process for metallic components. This design
framework should include at minimum part geometry, material mechanical
properties, defect types, as well as an inspection, monitoring or other
methodology to guarantee reliability of the component throughout its
operational design life. Only small laboratory coupons will be
fabricated during this phase of the program to verify and validate
different aspects of the RCAM CDF. PHASE II: The Phase I RCAM CDF will
be optimized and expanded to incorporate those characteristics that were
 not previously developed (such as a design optimization algorithm,
material microstructure, microstructure evolution, damage nucleation and
 progression and others as resources allow). The entire RCAM CDF
framework will be further optimized for usability, robustness and
performance. Small scale laboratory coupons will be fabricated to assist
 with the expansion and optimization activities of the RCAM CDF. For
validation purposes, a small air to air heat exchanger (HX) will be
designed using the RCAM CDF. The Principal Investigator will fabricate a
 minimum of four heat exchanger prototypes. The first HX will be used
for dimensional and functional characterization after manufacturing. The
 second HX will be used to perform detailed cross sectional
photo-micrographic analysis to validate the RCAM CDF after
manufacturing. The third HX will be used to monitor its reliability
throughout an accelerated testing phase. And the fourth HX prototype
will be used to perform detailed photo micrographic analysis to validate
 part reliability after the accelerate testing. The small business must
involve an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) during this phase of
the contract to facilitate the transition to Phase III. PHASE III: If
Phase II is successful, the company will be expected to support the Navy
 in transitioning the RCAM CDF for Navy use. Working with the Navy, the
company will integrate the RCAM CDF framework for evaluation to
determine its effectiveness in an operationally relevant environment.
The OEM involved during Phase II will be part of the transition team.
Phase III will include defining the additive manufacturing parameters
for qualified full scale system production and establishing facilities
capable of achieving full scale production capability of Navy-qualified
HXs. The small business will also focus on identifying potential
commercialization opportunities.",

        "topic_name": "Dive Helmet Communication System",
        "description": "The current system being used is analog circuits
 (circa 1960's) with components to match. The communication components
are susceptible to moisture and handling damage. Thus the existing
communication system has reduced intelligibility in the varying noise
levels of the current helmet. The diver helmet currently used by Navy
divers (Kirby Morgan KM 37NS) has documented high noise levels from the
breathing system with a circa 1960's communication system (analog on
copper wire). This is a challenging communication environment which is
complicated when using helium mixed gas (squeaky voice) and\/or at depth
 (compressed air). Breathing air maximum operating depth is 190 feet
seawater (fsw) and is 300 fsw for helium-oxygen mixes. Either breathing
medium may be used in water temperatures as low as 37\u00b0F, or as low
as 28\u00b0F if the helmet is used with the hot water shroud and a hot
water supply. In addition, at water temperatures below 40\u00b0F, the
diver will be dressed in either a variable volume dry suit or a hot
water suit. Additionally, the diver community has high incidence of
noise induced hearing loss (high frequency). An ideal communication
system would use modern, digital signal processing, with matched
microphones and speakers (actuators) to overcome these challenges and
the feedback that occurs in the current analog system. All required
components must be included in the system for improved diver (helmet)
and topside communications. The system shall be able to frequency
compensate to keep incoming signals in the optimal voice range for
divers and correct for topside signals. The new system must be robust
enough to handle the moisture\/salt in a marine diving (90% humidity)
scenario and the inherent rough handling of diver equipment. The system
should also include the capability for noise monitoring and use of fiber
 optic signal umbilical lines in the future (i.e. accommodate the use of
 fiber optic cables and the reduction of copper wire in the umbilical
lines). The system must work in the current noise levels of 94 to 97
dBA, which are noise hazardous (reference 1) and compromise current
communications. ANSI S3.2-2009 (R2014) (Method for Measuring the
Intelligibility of Speech over Communication Systems) would be an
appropriate means of evaluation using the modified rhyme test. ANSI
S3.2-2009 (R2014) includes factors that affect the intelligibility of
speech. The new system must reduce the noise feedback loop in the
helmet, producing high noise levels at the diver's ear, which increases
the noise exposure. The goal is to reduce noise levels below 85 dBA.
PHASE I: Determine the feasibility of developing and constructing
communication technologies to provide clear communications between
divers and the topside station. Develop a detailed design for a diver
communication system that can meet the performance and the constraints
listed in the equipment description for the Kirby Morgan KM37NS dive
helmet in reference 2. Similar commercial system is shown in reference
3. Currently approved communications systems are listed in reference 4.
The technical manual (N00178-04-D-4012\/HR06) is reference 5. Perform
design trade-offs to provide initial assessment of concept performance
for topside, bottom-side, multiple divers and umbilical components and
be suitable for the marine environment. The dive helmet communication
system must consider forward fit and back fit and be reported in the
Phase I Final Report. System concept must address pressure changes which
 occur in the helmet. System may utilize frequency shifting to deal with
 gas density and\/or mixed gas. System concept must also address diver
utility (i.e. ear equalization) if considered. Phase I includes the
initial layout and capabilities description to build the unit in Phase
II. Current topside design factors are Space: 10" x 9" x 14.5"; Weight:
22lbs; Power: 110\/220 VAC 50\/60 Hz (autosensing) or internal\/external
 battery 12 VDC. PHASE II: Produce dive helmet communication system
prototype hardware based on Phase I concept design for evaluation.
Finalize the prototype design and validate improved communications at
topside station. Also, validate improved communications under while
breathing air (maximum operating depth is 190 feet seawater (fsw) and is
 300 fsw for helium-oxygen mixes. Either breathing medium may be used in
 water temperatures as low as 37\u00b0F, or as low as 28\u00b0F if the
helmet is used with the hot water shroud and a hot water supply. In
addition, at water temperatures below 40\u00b0F, the diver will be
dressed in either a variable volume dry suit or a hot water suit.
Install developed prototype in a Kirby Morgan KM 37NS dive helmet. The
developer will use its own helmet during Phase II. Speech
intelligibility tests shall be performed to confirm the communication
improvements. Deliver two full prototype dive helmet communication
system kits for testing and evaluation at a location chosen by the US
Navy. PHASE III: Construct production units suitable for certification
for the Approved for Navy Use (ANU) List and develop marketing plans for
 a broad range of customers. Kits shall include all hardware required
for modification of helmets, topside equipment, installation, operations
 and maintenance procedures.",

Electro-optic \/ Infrared Sensor Based Precision Ship-Relative
Navigation for Automated Ship Landing",
        "description": "Carrier based fixed wing aircraft need accurate,
 high rate, and high integrity precision ship-relative navigation
(PS-RN) to conduct safe and efficient automated landings. This SBIR is
focused on capability that is not dependent on Radio Frequency (RF)
emissions or Global Positioning System (GPS) in order to reduce
vulnerability to interference. The PS-RN solution must initialize very
quickly because of the relatively high closure rates (approx. 120
knots). Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) aircraft mounted cameras are
attractive sensors due to low cost and size, but do not directly measure
 range and angle, so these calculations must be reliably extracted from
the imagery at a high data rate (approx. 30 Hz). They must initialize
quickly (10 seconds or less) when imagery becomes usable as the aircraft
 approaches the ship, even with obscured visibility and deck motion.
Current image detection, tracking, and template matching require too
much time (over 1 minute) to be usable for a jet aircraft approach in
reduced visibility. Convergence rate of linearized filters is not
adequate for the required precision of relative navigation; non-linear
filters may provide a workable approach. For this SBIR effort, the
sensors to be used are aircraft mounted electro-optic and\/or infrared
cameras, with optional use of ship mounted light or beacon sources. The
navigation scenario begins at 4 nautical miles (NMI), with the aircraft
at 1200 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL), and within 10 degrees of the landing
area centerline. The aircraft inertial measurement unit (IMU) can be
used. Ship location is known within 1\/2 NMI, course and speed are known
 within 10 degrees and 5 knots. The ship must be detected and tracking
begin rapidly when it enters the sensor field of view; the
initialization goal is 10 seconds. The camera system, including lenses,
must be small (approx. 200 cubic inches) and able to withstand the
electromagnetic interference, shock, and vibration environment of a
carrier landing. Only two fixed focal lengths can be used for the entire
 approach. Computer processing must be done on 1 or 2 cards added to an
existing mission computer. Aircraft pose estimate must be accurate
within 0.20 degree in azimuth and elevation, and range within 4%. It
must be a high integrity solution with sufficient accuracy and
continuity (in concert with the IMU) suitable for aircraft control. Ship
 motions corresponding to sea state 4 must be identified. The lights or
beacons must be suitable for installation on the deck, hull, catwalk, or
 other structural location on an aircraft carrier. PHASE I: Determine
feasibility for the development of rapidly initializing detection,
tracking and relative pose estimation processes that could be used to
provide navigation inputs to the flight control system of a carrier
based fixed wing aircraft for landing on an aircraft carrier. Develop a
system concept for this purpose and report on the results. PHASE II:
Based on Phase I effort, develop and demonstrate sensor processing using
 available sensor(s) for rapid-initialization PS-RN real-time
capability, in simulation, in full range of lighting conditions, from
full sun to overcast moonless night, with sea state 4 deck motion.
Determine through simulation maximum range capability in fog and rain,
and determine the heaviest fog and rain that can exist and still allow
accurate navigation to begin at no less than \u00be nautical mile.
Collect imagery data during flight approaches and landings in day and
dark night conditions using low cost surrogate aircraft and a land based
 facility. Use these imagery data to demonstrate rapid-initializing real
 time PS-RN in the laboratory. Conduct an open loop demonstration of
real time PS-RN capability in flight. Update the models and software for
 delivery to the Navy simulation laboratory. PHASE III: From the results
 of Phase II, design and fabricate a processing system using available
sensors which can be carried by an F\/A-18 aircraft. The Navy will
gather flight test imagery using this system in a separately funded

proliferation of UUVs throughout the world is presenting an emerging
challenge for force protection in harbor environments. It is important
to counter sensor laden units that do not present a direct threat, but
an armed UUV presents a particularly compelling challenge. The mobility
of UUVs limits the effectiveness of traditional mine countermeasures
like change detection. The stationary nature of the assets that are
being protected in harbors allows for slow and deliberate approaches by
enemy platforms. Current strategies for detecting and classifying UUVs

the generation of RF power in a two terminal diode. Examples are IMPact
ionization Avalanche Transit Time (IMPATT) diodes demonstrated in
Silicon, Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), and Indium Phosphide (InP). By both
thermal considerations and large breakdown field, Gallium Nitride-based
avalanche devices should offer a substantial advance (~100X) in power
output with improved efficiency (~2X). The problem in wide bandgap
nitrides is that until recently, avalanche breakdown has not been
experimentally observed, despite two decades of material advances. The
absence of experimental observation is often attributed to the higher
dislocation density of current GaN technology, which lowers the
breakdown electric field threshold due to non-avalanching mechanisms.
Recently there are reports of the observation of
avalanche-breakdown-like behavior in GaN devices for power electronics,
where avalanche breakdown phenomena are exploited to prevent device
burnout. No RF devices have been developed to exploit the avalanche
behavior. The goal of this topic is to demonstrate RF power generation

        "description": "Thermal Management is a critical requirement for
 future warships with electronic propulsion, weapon, and sensor systems.
 Innovative thermal architectures are needed to cool next-generation,
high-energy density electronics which are expected to exhibit highly
transient loads during pulsed operation. Two-phase cooling systems, such
 as vapor compression cycles, pumped cooling loops, and hybrid systems,
are of particular interest for electronics cooling applications due to
the large heat transfer coefficients from boiling flow, as well as their
 capability to maintain isothermal conditions as ambient temperature
varies. In the presence of large thermal transients, active control may
be required to avoid temperature variations, thermal lag, flow
instabilities and critical heat-flux, which do not occur in
state-of-the-art systems based on single-phase convective cooling. While
 control strategies for air-conditioning and refrigeration systems are
well developed, the use of phase change cycles for electronics cooling
is relatively new. In order for the thermal control system to
accommodate transients, the component response times need to be
understood and the control system optimized to ensure stable operation
of coupled components while avoiding dry-out. The objective of this
topic is to develop a software toolset with a graphical user interface
to model various component configurations and control approaches for an
electronics thermal control system. This toolset will allow for modeling
 of component interactions under dynamic thermal loads and evaluation of
 control methodologies for optimizing thermal performance, while
minimizing system size and weight. Such components include, but are not
limited to, variable speed compressors, pumps, electronic expansion
devices, accumulators, charge compensators, liquid receivers, cold
plates, condensers, and other components used in a two-phase thermal
control system. The toolset will need to be able to monitor temperature,
 pressure, and flow, and simulate active control of components for
modification of operation based on control algorithms and user inputs.
PHASE I: Develop component-level models (using a subset of components
listed above) and formulate system-level concepts to characterize the
control architecture for multiple-cold-plate, active thermal control
systems. Validate model performance through static and transient
laboratory experiments. PHASE II: Based upon Phase I results, develop
full-scale system-level software tools and control system modeling
capability to optimize thermal response of advanced multi-cold plate
architectures. Characterize operation, including transient behavior, of a
 representative thermal control system. Operationally test control
system with relevant and\/or simulating hardware. Deliver a standalone
software toolset with graphical user interface. PHASE III: Based upon
Phase II effort, finalize software toolset and graphical user interface.
 Provide transition and commercialization plans using the knowledge
gained during Phases I and II. Provide support during developmental and
operational testing on full-scale radar, weapon, and other
systems.&amp;nbsp;",

System",
        "description": "Advances in high power microwave threats pose
significant dangers to critical naval electronic systems. To mitigate
these dangers, a warning system is needed that will cover a broad range
of potential HPRF frequencies and large dynamic range of intensities
with the ability to survive and be operational under the highest
intensities with low false alarm rate. The HPRF sensor should be able to
 provide frequency information of the attack, which may be wideband
pulses (100-500 MHz, pulse widths 2 \u2013 200 ns) or narrowband (500
MHz \u2013 5 GHz, pulse widths 1ns-5\u03bcs). It must also measure the
approximate power level as well as information about the direction to,
and possible range of, the attacker to provide information for possible
evasion maneuvers or potential retaliation. It is desirable to obtain
HPRF geo-location information with an error of less than 5 degrees in
both the azimuth and elevation\/declination and provide an approximate
target range. The HPRF irradiation may or not be repetitive. The system
should be able to survive HPRF field intensities in excess of 50 W\/cm2
without damage to the detection system (i.e. sufficiently high damage
threshold). The system should be able to detect and characterize the
power and frequency of current and anticipated HPRF sources being
developed. Peak power and waveform measurements of the HPRF along with
historical tracking of background RF irradiation\/waveforms should be
used to maximize the detector dynamic range and reduce the false alarm
rate to levels below 1%. The system should be capable of roughly
estimating the direction of attack, and estimated distance, and RF
parameters so that facility decision makers can take proper action. The
project is subject to technical risks in covering the broad range of
potential intensities, possible frequencies and waveforms. The
affordable system should be immune to the HPRF attack and have a low
SWaP footprint that can be easily integrated into navy platforms (such
as helos and UAVs) and their power sources without negatively impacting
current system functionality such as power supplies, aerodynamics,
weight-balance, and\/or cargo\/passenger space.\n\nPHASE I:
Conceptualize, design, develop, and model key elements for an innovative
 HPRF Advanced Warning System (AWS) that can meet the requirements
discussed in the description section with emphasis on low false alarm
rate and on providing accurate direction and range of the attacker;
these latter items are important to extend the present state of the art.
 Perform modeling and simulation to provide initial assessment of the
performance of the concept. The design should establish realizable
technological solutions for a device capable of achieving the desired
geo-locating accuracy for the wide range of HPRF waveforms listed while
being immune to the effects of the HPRF irradiation. The proposed design
 should be an 80% complete solution and include all sub-systems
necessary for this innovative HPRF AWS. The proposed brass board system
should be designed to demonstrate a path towards providing a compact
solution (with low SWaP) that can be easily integrated onto air (e.g.
UAVs), ground or nautical platforms. Cost analysis and material
development should be included to ascertain critical needs not yet fully
 developed or readily available given current technology. The design and
 modeling results of Phase I should lead to plans to build a prototype
unit in Phase II.\n\nPHASE II: Phase II will involve the design
refinement, procurement, integration, assembly, and testing of a proof
of concept brass board prototype leveraging the Phase I effort. The
Phase II brass board prototype will be capable of providing frequency
information of the HPRF source, which may be wideband pulses (100-500
MHz, 2 \u2013 200 ns) or narrowband (500 MHz \u2013 5 GHz, pulse widths,
 1ns-5\u03bcs), and measure the approximate HPRF power level as well as
provide accurate geo-location information as stated above. This brass
board prototype must demonstrate a clear path forward to a full scale
concept demonstrator based on the selected technology. Data packages on
all critical components will be submitted throughout the prototype
development cycle and test results will be provided for regular review
of progress. The use of actual hardware and empirical data collection is
 expected for this analysis.\n\nPHASE III: The performer will apply the
knowledge gained during Phase I and II to build and demonstrate the full
 scale functional final design that will include all system elements and
 represent a complete solution. The final design should be compact and
ruggedized and the sensor should be platform mountable (e.g. exterior of
 an airborne platform such as a UAV). The device should be applicable
for test range use and should be immune to the damage from HPRF. The
functional final design will provide notification of attack and capture
data for later analysis. The data will provide signal characterization
including field strength, frequency, pulse width, and repetition rate.
Additionally it will provide for angle of arrival and probable distance.
 The probe(s) should be immune to HPRF. Data packages on all critical
components and subcomponents will be submitted throughout the final
development cycle and test results will be regularly submitted for
review of progress. It is desirable for the performer to work closely
with NAVAIR Program Offices, e.g. PEO (U&amp;W) PMA-263, Navy and Marine
 Corps Small Tactical UAS and PMA-272 Tactical Aircraft Protection
Systems program office to maximize transition and field testing
opportunities. The initial use and desire for this final design will be
to provide an Affordable Compact HPRF\/HPM Attack Warning System that
can be combined with existing Naval UAS or Helicopter assets in a
protective configuration for future Directed Energy threats. Working
with the Navy and Marine Corps, the company will integrate their
prototype HPRF\/HPM Attack Warning System onto an existing vehicle for
evaluation to determine its effectiveness in an operationally relevant
environment. The company will support the Navy and Marine Corps for test
 and validation to certify and qualify the system for Navy and Marine
Corps use. The company will develop manufacturing plans and capabilities
 to produce the system for both military and commercial markets.",

Flywheel Energy Storage for Shipboard Pulse Load Operation",
        "description": "The introduction of advanced weapons systems
such as rail guns, lasers, and other future pulse loads to future
warships create power and energy demands that exceed what a traditional
ship electric plant interface can provide. This creates the problem of
satisfying growing demand for with stored energy, while working within
the limited space available aboard ship platforms. Flywheel energy
storage systems are potentially attractive due to high cycle life
capability, tolerance for military environmental conditions, and
capability for buffering multiple stochastic loads. This is provided by
the capability to support rapid discharge and charge cycles on a
continuous basis. However, prior Navy flywheel installations have been
\u201cbuilt in\u201d, which do not allow for easy removal and
replacement via a hatchable and\/or modular installation that is
scalable for multi-MW operation. The size and overall design of these
flywheel systems are driven by issues such as rotor energy density due
to tip speed limitations due to available material strength. Carbon
Nanotube (CNT) based macrostructures in the form of conductive fiber and
 sheets with high strength and resilience provide the potential to
improve state of the art flywheel energy storage. For flywheel designs,
it is anticipated that CNT based composites can increase the available
energy by over 30% as compared to existing state of art composite
materials. This results in a potentially thermally, mechanically and
dynamically compliant system operating with a tip speed greater than
1000 m\/s. Given the infancy of this technology, innovative research is
necessary to identify and prove the actual improvements over baseline
state of the art composite designs, by applying new means of CNT
integration into advanced wheel designs. The U.S. Navy is therefore
interested in developing and characterizing the advantages of innovative
 shipboard flywheel system designs, directed and optimized to the MW
scale, which maximize the advantages of CNT material integration. For
the purposes of this effort, the below theoretical metrics of the
flywheel design will be used as a basis. Continuously online
charge-discharge of up to 50% duty cycle (e.g. up to 50% charging, 50%
discharging). 26\u201d shipboard hatchable design for easy removal or
installation of components. Modular installation and operation
capability to multi-MW levels, with relevant bus voltage and power
conversion. Operation over the temperature range (40 \u2013 140 F).
Provide the capability to last for 60000 hours of online use and support
 &gt;20000 cycles. The flywheel should be designed such that any the
inertial material or other moving parts cannot penetrate into any
personnel space under a catastrophic failure.\n\nPHASE I: Determine
feasibility and develop a conceptual system design for a CNT flywheel
energy storage system and provide comparison against alternative
existing metals or composite materials. The comparative design should
highlight advantages that CNT components provide with respect to size,
weight and performance in a shipboard environment. Perform an initial
development effort that demonstrates scientific merit and capabilities
of the proposed CNT materials for application in a high speed rotating
storage application. Laboratory coupon specimens should be fabricated
and characterized.\n\nPHASE II: Fabricate the prototype CNT based
components associated with the kinetic energy storage design developed
in Phase I to the highest allowable scale given constraints of budget
and schedule. Fully characterize and demonstrate capabilities and
limitations of the CNT material based component. Update the kinetic
energy storage design developed in Phase I based on results.\n\nPHASE
III: Based on Phase I and II effort, fabricate full megawatt-scale
kinetic energy storage system incorporating CNT materials to support
shipboard energy storage system incorporating CNT materials to support
shipboard energy storage pulse power requirements through the existing
ONR Multifunction Energy Storage FNC.",

        "topic_name": "Attack Sensitive Brittle Software",
        "description": "Critical cyber systems are subject to attacks by
 the enemy. Generally, resilience and survivability are considered
desirable properties for software in these systems. They aim to remain
operational, though at a degraded state, when they are compromised.
However, this is not always desirable. There may be circumstances where
it is preferable for the software to be brittle and simply crash when
attacks\/exploits are successful. This would be the case when integrity
and confidentiality requirements are much more important than
availability requirements. Compromised or misbehaving software could be
much more dangerous than simple unavailability. Another circumstance is
when redundant and diversified backup systems are readily available. A
faster failure and timely switch-over would minimize the
disruption\/damage and actually enhance overall resilience. Brittleness
would be a plus in these circumstances. The aim is for the crash to
occur as soon as possible after a successful attack and program control
is lost. The objective of this solicitation is to develop transformation
 mechanisms for software that increase brittleness and achieve the
\u201cfast-crash\u201d property. The transformation mechanisms should be
 generic and able to be applied to third party software. They should
also preserve the functionality of the original software and incur
relatively small computational overheads. We are interested in
transformations that act on all layers including binary, byte code, and
source code. The \u201cfast-crash\u201d property can be defined as the
number of instructions\/jumps\/stack operations that gets executed after
 control of the program is lost. Compromised software will eventually
crash; our goal is to speed up the crash so that malicious behavior
cannot take place before it occurs. As such, \u201cfast-crash\u201d
should occur within a handful of instruction\/branches. Techniques that
enhance resilience and survivability of code segments and systems have
been an active area of research. We are looking for techniques that do
the opposite. There is currently little research that explicitly aims to
 create brittleness in software. However, it is often the side-effect of
 some security techniques especially in the context of artificial
diversity and randomization. For example, address space layout
randomization (ASLR) aims to prevent buffer overflow attacks by making
it difficult to reliably jump to a particular exploited function in
memory [4,5]. Attempted attacks would crash the program by attempting
jumps to invalid addresses. ASLR would be considered an effective
\u201cfast-crash\u201d mechanism. We are looking for other mechanisms of
 achieving the \u201cfast-crash\u201d property against different
categories of attacks such as return oriented programming (ROP). We
would consider application, customization, or assessment of existing
security mechanisms in the context of \u201cfast-crash\u201d. However,
novel mechanisms will be prioritized especially if they are able to be
simpler, lighter weight, and more dependable than mechanisms meant for
other purposes. It\u2019s important to note that \u201cfast-crash\u201d
is different from active integrity verification techniques that directly
 identify attacks. We are NOT as interested in mechanisms that monitor
the system and trigger a crash when attacks are detected. Ideally, the
system crash should simply be a byproduct or guaranteed side-effect of a
 successful attack and compromise. The system should crash quickly and
consistently after faults that are associated with deliberate attacks.
At the same time, the system should not crash when attacks are not
taking place or after random faults. The success of the result will be
measured by both the false-positive rate and the false-negative rate.
This SBIR topic will also consider active techniques if they are novel,
generalized, and easily deployed. Another preference is for techniques
that do not require source code and can be applied to raw binaries the
military already deploys. PHASE I: Develop and discuss the approach for
the \u201cfast-crash\u201d transformation mechanism. Demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the mechanism on arbitrary code
segments. Prototypes of components that demonstrate the concept will be
desirable. PHASE II: Based upon Phase I effort, develop and demonstrate a
 fully functioning prototype of the \u201cfast-crash\u201d system on the
 provided experimental platform. Validate its efficacy during normal
system operations and in the face of arbitrary attacks. PHASE III: Upon
successful completion of Phase II effort, the performer will provide
support in transitioning the technology for Navy use as required. The
performer will develop a plan for integrating the product into the
Navy\u2019s HM&amp;amp;E software control systems and supervisory
systems.",

        "topic_name": "In-Transit Visibility Module for Lifts of
Opportunity Program (LOOP) &amp;amp; Transportation Exploitation Tool
(TET)",
        "description": "The United States Transportation Command
(USTRANSCOM) plans and executes worldwide movement of cargo and people
at sea, on land, and in the air, launching an average of 1,700 movements
 a day. Navy Fleet\/Force transportation requests within USTRANSCOM are
routed to specialists who focus on satisfying requirements using a mode
of transportation with minimal coordination between them and their
counterparts. To avoid the high cost for dedicated USTRANSCOM Special
Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM) or contracted commercial flights, the
Navy developed and implemented a Transportation Exploitation Tool (TET)
prototype. TET helps planners find cargo capacity on SAAMs or other
conveyances that can support mission requirements resulting in
significant cost avoidance for the urgent movement of cargo worldwide.
Once a mission is booked, transportation planners and fleet forces
require the ability to accurately track urgently needed cargo as it
moves from its origin to its destination and through all transportation
nodes, and then allow planners to close out the mission. The ITV of
critical supplies throughout the movement will have several important
benefits: 1) allows team to plan for material handling, and other
special equipment and personnel needed to load the cargo at
transportation nodes, 2) provides early identification of problems or
delays during the mission that may necessitate re-planning, and 3)
increased visibility helps ensure critical items are not needlessly
re-ordered. Current state of the art for large scale DoD ITV systems use
 radio frequency identification (RFID) tags and a network of read\/write
 stations (to include satellites). Systems like the Army's
Joint-Automatic Identification Technology (J-AIT) have over 1,900
stations alone. These types of systems are costly and manpower
intensive. The limitations the Navy has for manpower and funding
requires an innovative solution for an ITV capability using data that is
 already available. The focus of the ITV module is threefold. First is
development of software tools (Intelligent Agents (IAs) and semantic
services) that can take disparate sources of data (real-time feeds,
near-real-time feeds, manual entry, and historical references) and fuse
them to accurately infer location data of transported items with high
confidence. Second is development of additional decision support tools
to aid planners. This includes automatic generation of alerts and
tracking of mission performance metrics. Third and final is development
of predictive models that will use the same data sources to anticipate
arrival times of logistical items. The capability to predict arrival
times (updated as the current location changes) of goods in finer
granularity than current methodologies is necessary to facilitate
planning. Using machine learning methodologies, the predictive models
should be able to learn from previously executed missions to identify
trends that support successful mission planning and execution.
Challenges include development of a robust IA that can digest large
quantities of data and mine pertinent information (specified and
inferred) on specific items. Data may need to be semantically connected
(for example, connection of the cargo ID to a strategic mission with its
 flight schedule and inflight tracking data) in order to derive relevant
 mission data (location, time to arrival, and probability of success for
 completing the next mission leg). The software tools need to be
accurate, reliable, and able to run efficiently on handheld operating
systems compatible with the Ozone Widget Framework (OWF). The existing
TET system runs as a web service on the NIPRNET\/SIPRNET (the Department
 of Navy's unclassified and classified internal computer networks). For
this effort, the ITV module will initially attain static or live data
feeds from existing TET services through an existing systems integration
 laboratory (SIL) environment (the government will ensure access to the
SIL for the awarded companies) at The Pennsylvania State University
(PSU) Applied Research Laboratory (ARL), independent of Department of
Defense (DoD) networks but funded by the government. The SIL environment
 with virtual machines will allow experimentation and integration
without the need for operational security and information assurance
certification until the system is actually deployed. Message
communications between TET and the ITV service is required; for example
an alert of a missed transportation connection would be pushed back to
TET to initiate dynamic re-planning of the mission. Examples of
communication channels that need to interface with TET\/ITV: Marine
Corps' Tactical Service Oriented Architecture (TSOA), Naval Tactical
Cloud (NTC). Examples of incoming data feeds provided via the SIL:
IDE\/GTN Convergence (IGC), Global Decision Support System (GDSS),
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National ITV Server, Global Air
Transportation Execution System (GATES), Weather, Coast Guard Automated
Information System (AIS) or equivalent. Real time feeds will ultimately
be pursued with support from the government.\n\n\nPHASE I: Define and
develop a concept and software architecture for an ITV module that can
infer location of a logistical item using available real time feeds,
near-real time feeds, and historical data. The ITV module architecture
shall support communication with NAVSUP's Transportation Exploitation
Tool (TET) to receive mission details, data feeds, and to transmit
alerts or other messages back to TET. The performer will define decision
 support tools to capture critical metrics of current\/historical
mission performance. These tools require automatically generated alerts
for situations that may hinder mission success and that prompt actions
from planners. In addition, develop predictive models that provide
real\/near-real time updates of arrival times for logistical items. The
performer will also define an open source widget based approach to
enable mobile\/handheld devices to interact with the ITV module. At the
conclusion of Phase I, the performer should provide a viable path
forward for the implementation of the concept ensuring coupling of
communication with the TET tool. The small business shall deliver
architecture views, describe the software's major functions, describe
the user interface, outline data messaging functions, and describe the
proposed software development process, schedule, risk, and
cost.\n\nPHASE II: Develop and demonstrate a handheld ITV prototype
based on Phase I efforts in a SIL environment. The software shall
demonstrate all major functionality to include ITV and prediction of
arrival of TET missions in execution, implementation of decision support
 tools (i.e. real-time alerts) , and collection of key performance
metrics for use in future analytic models. This includes validating
ability of the ITV module to locate an object for a lift of opportunity
mission in execution with high confidence to accurately predict arrival
times within a low margin of error, using only the data feeds provided
to the performer through ONR and PSU ARL. The ability of the module to
mine, digest, and derive object location, in the finest granularity
possible, in a timely manner (within a few minutes) is necessary to
ensure an appropriate planning capability. Alerts and other desired
analytical and decision support aspects will also be demonstrated. Phase
 II will include a government evaluation by transportation planners at
NAVSUP in Norfolk.\n\nPHASE III: Phase III will focus on the seamless
integration of the ITV module with the TET in a cross domain
NIPRNET\/SIPRNET environment by transportation planners in Norfolk, VA.

Features",
        "description": "More than 60 percent of Satellite Communications
 (SATCOM) users are supported by the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) band.
The Navy\u2019s Communications Satellite Program Office (PMW 146)
acquires UHF SATCOM satellites for the Department of Defense (DoD). The
current operational UHF Follow On (UFO) satellites will soon be replaced
 by the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) constellation, which should
be fully launched by 2017. Soon the Navy will investigate potential next
 generation UHF SATCOM systems. Acquisition of the system that follows
MUOS will likely start in the next few years. Enhanced protection
features will be critical for that system. Since the MUOS satellites
were designed, it has become apparent that the space domain \u201cis
becoming increasingly congested, contested, and competitive\u201d as
described in the National Security Space Strategy. The next generation
of satellites must be protected from a number of threats including radio
 frequency interference. Many previous research efforts have developed
technology to protect terrestrial UHF SATCOM terminals. These efforts
aimed to protect terminals against local interference in the SATCOM
downlink (space to ground link) or against interference in the SATCOM
uplink (ground to space link) that was re-broadcast to the ground by the
 satellite transponder. This effort seeks innovative solutions which are
 resident on the satellite. The goal is to protect the SATCOM uplink at
the satellite instead of protecting the terrestrial terminals. CubeSats
or nano-satellites are popular among universities and are gaining
momentum with commercial and government organizations. They may be an
avenue to demonstrate new electromagnetic interference protection
features quickly and at low cost. Such a demonstration path, if
applicable to a particular interference protection feature, would likely
 allow the new technology to be tested in space in time for it to be
incorporated into the next generation of UHF SATCOM satellites. If the
technology is also applicable to nano-satellites, it could find use in
emerging nano-satellite programs within DoD.\n\n\nPHASE I: Determine
feasibility and develop advanced electromagnetic interference protection
 features for future UHF SATCOM satellites. Perform analysis, modeling
and simulation, or other calculations to establish performance
possibilities. Translate design concepts into a product development
roadmap establishing a technical and program pathway to an operational
capability demonstration. Tasks under this phase include:\n\u2022
Develop new electromagnetic interference protection concepts for UHF
SATCOM satellites\n\u2022 Create an initial design of the protection
feature(s)\n\u2022 Characterize and explore system trades\n\u2022
Predict performance parameters\n\u2022 Implement early prototype(s) and
demonstrate in a laboratory environment if applicable\n\u2022 Evaluate
potential CubeSat or nano-satellite demonstration options, if
applicable\n\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype electromagnetic interference
 protection feature(s) and demonstrate it in a space environment. \u2022
 Evaluate measured performance characteristics versus expectations and
make design adjustments as necessary \u2022 Demonstrate the performance
of the electromagnetic interference protection feature \u2022
Demonstrate the technology in a space environment. This could entail
integration with a CubeSat or nano-satellite. Another possibility is
laboratory based environmental testing such as thermal vacuum,
vibration, radiation and other testing. Capabilities demonstrated (e.g.
performance characteristics and\/or limitations) in Phase II may become
classified.\n\n\nPHASE III: Based on Phase I and II effort, finalize
design and integrate the electromagnetic interference protection
technology into future UHF SATCOM systems.",

Technologies",
        "description": "Sensors (SE) Recent technological advancements
in materials science and bioengineered systems have made inexpensive,
powerful, and ubiquitous sensing a reality. Examples range from truly
smart airframes and self-evaluating buildings and infrastructure for
natural hazard mitigation to large-scale weather forecasting,
self-organizing energy systems, and smart devices that self-assemble
into networks leading to the first electronic nervous system that
connects the Internet back to the physical world. New detection
technologies that overcome barriers of time, scale, materials, and
environment, and emphasize self-calibration, selectivity, and
sensitivity are solicited. Wireless Technologies (WT) Wireless has
become the platform for many applications with direct impact on
virtually every aspect of life, evolving well beyond mobile phones and
PDAs to other devices, services, channels, and content. Microwave
circuits afford wider frequency spectrum and very short antennae. With
GaAs and SiGe, entire microwave transceivers can be inexpensively put on
 a single chip. Modulation methods, like spread-spectrum and orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing, bring greater spectral efficiency and
more bits\/Hz of bandwidth, and lead to less susceptibility to noise,
interference, and multi-path distortion. On-chip DSPs allow new
signal-processing functions. RFID chips are providing improvements in
warehousing, materials handling, and shipping operations, replacing
bar-code labels in many areas. Energy and Power Management (EP) In the
power electronics realm, as CMOS chips go to finer lithography with each
 new generation, their multiplying transistors require lower voltages
and higher currents. These trends have driven up power demands on
printed circuit boards and placed constant pressure on power-supply and
power-system developers to increase the efficiency and power or current
density. At the same time, the trends toward lower voltages and higher
currents have encouraged migration from centralized to distributed and
portable power architectures. Robotics and Human Assistive Technologies
(RH) Considerable progress will be made if robots possessed the high
intelligence needed to cope with uncertainty, learn from experience, and
 work as a team. Robot designers are borrowing features from insect
nervous systems, and engineers and computer scientists collaborate with
biologists, neuroscientists, and psychologists to exploit new knowledge
in the study of the brain and behavior. Some robots will help people do
what they can't or would rather not do. Other robots will tackle complex
 projects by working as teams. Robots will help protect critical
infrastructure and monitor the environment as mobile, intelligent
sensors. High-performance processors, hardware to provide situational
awareness, and improved artificial intelligence (AI) are enabling
researchers to create lifelike robots with an entire gamut of facial
expressions. Micro-electronics Packaging, Thermal Management &amp;amp;
Systems Integration (MT) Proposals are solicited on more efficient means
 of integrating semiconductor components and devices into systems. The
growth in chip density, coupled with the demand for high performance,
small size, light weight, and affordable reliability has placed enormous
 pressure on interconnect technology and packaging at all levels.
Innovations include (but not limited to) improved techniques for
interconnect and packaging at the board level, packaging approaches for
the board components, the passive components, techniques for board
assembly, and applications of techniques to packaging and systems
integration for optoelectronics and wireless systems.",

 process. NLP uses machine learning to extract information or derive
meaning from human language (written or spoken) or to generate human
language.&amp;nbsp;  Examples of relevant technical fields within
machine learning include (but are not limited to): supervised machine
learning; semi-supervised machine learning; unsupervised machine
learning; neural networks; machine learning algorithms - e.g. decision
tree learning; robot learning; pattern recognition; image recognition.

\u2013 A Software Tool to Automate the Standards Development Process",
        "description": "\n\tThe development of documentary and test
standards is a long and tedious process.&amp;nbsp; Challenges facing
standards developers include complex, inadequately defined terminology,
and rapidly changing associated information content. Even after a
standard is &amp;ldquo;set,&amp;rdquo; its implementation and adoption
can be hampered by the gap between the technical requirements of that
standard and the technology required to implement those
requirements.\n\n\tNIST seeks a software tool that will make the process
 of designing and developing documentary standards faster, more robust,
and more integrated. The model for this subtopic is the so-called
Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool, itself modeled after
the Computer Aided Design (CAD) tool, but applied to standards
development and deployment. The tool should provide the following
capabilities for standards development and
deployment:\n\n\t\n\t\tCategorize and organize standards&amp;rsquo;
content in a structured information model, supporting modularization and
 reuse.&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tEstablish terminology connections between
related standards, and maintain semantic consistency across
standards.\n\t\n\t\tGenerate a visual representation and navigation
scheme for the standard, so that the standard may be communicated to the
 end-user through interactive means (such as a touch-screen
tablet).\n\t\n\t\tProvide an underlying formal model that is amenable to
 testing and verification, and that facilitates the implementation of
the standard by automatic or semiautomatic generation of software
modules. This should allow software implementers to extract portions of
the standard to meet specific implementation
requirements\n\n\n\tStandards development organizations (SDOs) and the
scientific and engineering societies that participate in those
organizations will benefit greatly from such a tool. Vendors will
benefit from the tool since it would pull from the existing standard,
populate the tool, and allow a consistent assessment for the vendor to
identify the requirements. NIST will greatly benefit from such a tool to
 enable better testing of standards for broad industry deployment. Such a
 tool will also allow NIST to develop metrics to assess the
&amp;ldquo;quality&amp;rdquo; of a standard, and to verify whether an
implementation meets a standard&amp;rsquo;s scope and
requirements.\n\n\tThe life-cycle of a standard may involve three broad
stages [1].&amp;nbsp; First is the development stage, in the course of
which stakeholders gather within committees, prepare a draft, and come
to a consensus on a final standard.&amp;nbsp; The second stage is the
deployment stage, which may include a pilot-scale implementation,
followed by industry-wide implementation.&amp;nbsp; The third stage is
the maintenance stage, in which the standard is revised and maintained. A
 well-defined underlying information structure\/model will facilitate
the implementation of all three stages.&amp;nbsp; In addition, it can
support the instantiation and communication of the standard to the
end-users using the varied digital media available today. Even though
information management and software tools have advanced considerably
over the recent decades, SDOs rarely take advantage of those
advancements.\n\n\tThe goals of this project are the following: 1) Build
 a framework for developing a taxonomy and ontology for the terminology
and concepts contained in a standard; 2) Capture the requirements of a
standard in a formal model; and 3) Develop a standard as a structured
information model, instead of a simple text
document.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tAdditional tools to automatically verify these
models for consistency and generate other artifacts such as documents
and software implementation modules can be also developed. All of these
will be supported by a tool that will allow standards developers and
end-users to interactively view and navigate the information models.
Such technology will greatly improve the deployment, adoption, and
maintenance of standards.\n\n\tThe outcome of this effort will bring
together SDOs, software implementers, and end-users (both manufacturers
and their consumers) under a single framework and allow them to exchange
 standards information in an unambiguous and efficient manner. While the
 focus of this SBIR subtopic will be related to standards in
manufacturing, the general methodology is applicable to other industry
sectors.\n\n\tPhase I activities and expected results:\n\n\t\n\t\tExpand
 on the NIST Ontological Visualization Interface for Standards (NOVIS)
tool [2,3] to develop a taxonomy editor for standards. This should
include a classification scheme and underlying ontology modeling the
concepts and relationships.\n\t\n\t\tDevelop a formal representation
scheme to capture the requirements for a standard. This may be based on
the Framework for Analysis, Comparison, and Test of Standards (FACTS)
work [4].\n\t\n\t\tDevelop an export\/import mechanism for the
information content of a standard and associated document
formats.\n\t\n\t\tDevelop a business case for a Computer Aided Standards
 Development (CASD) tool working with standards developing
organizations, such as, ASME, ASTM, IEEE, OMG, and ISO.\n\n\n\tPhase II
activities and expected results:\n\n\t\n\t\tDesign an initial
architecture and software for realizing a computer aided tool for
standards development.\n\t\n\t\tDevelop a Computer Aided Standards
Development (CASD) tool and a comprehensive case
study\/demonstration.\n\t\n\t\tDesign an interface between a CASD tool
and document generation software, in the form of a plug-in to a document
 editor that interfaces with the underlying CASD model.\n\t\n\t\tDesign a
 mechanism for automatic or semiautomatic generation of software to
implement modules of the standard.\n\t\n\t\tA framework for a standards
repository where the standards may reside as information models. The
framework should support version control, cross standard linking, and
maintenance of information consistency across standards.\n\n\n\tNIST
will consult and provide input to assess progress and
performance.\n\n\tReferences:\n\n\t1. Cargill, C.F., Why Standardization

imaging (MRI) have recently been demonstrated at NIST [1-4]. The
technology relies on thin-film fabrication methods adapted from the
semiconductor industry.&amp;nbsp; This &amp;ldquo;top-down&amp;rdquo;
approach is expensive and suffers from low yield compared to
&amp;ldquo;bottom-up&amp;rdquo; methods based on chemical synthesis for
making other types of contrast agents. NIST seeks applications focused
on the development and demonstration of high-throughput techniques for
making this new class of MRI contrast agent in sufficient quantity that
biologists and physicians can explore new applications. These methods
must achieve the necessary control of dimensional and materials
properties at nanometer size scales. In addition, manufacturing methods
must lead to materials that can be readily prepared for animal studies
and potentially for clinical trials using methods currently available in
 the biomedical community.\n\n\tThe technical proposal must provide
details on how to achieve the following goals:\n\n\t1. Manufacturing
methods will lead to contrast agents with the sensitivity and
functionality similar to those demonstrated at NIST using wafer-based
manufacturing methods. For T2* agents (see Ref. [1]) , this implies
micrometer-scale magnetic particles with sizes and magnetic moments that
 vary by no more than 5 to 10 % (ideally less) from one particle to
another. For multispectral agents (see Refs.&amp;nbsp; [2-4]), this
implies, in addition, that magnetic particle shapes are sufficiently
well controlled and similar to one another to ensure that the resulting
shifted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) water linewidths generated by
single particles, as well as by ensembles of particles, are no more than
 10 to 20 % (ideally less) of the NMR frequency shift itself. For
example, methods for making hollow magnetic nano-cylinders [3] should
ideally have control to within a few percent over the thickness of the
cylinder wall as well as the length and diameter of the
cylinder.&amp;nbsp; Depending on cylinder size, this may translate to
control of a few nanometers for wall thickness and of a few tens of
nanometers for cylinder length.\n\n\t2. Manufacturing methods should be
capable of producing millimolar solutions in 0.1 liter batches for
in-vivo biological applications.\n\n\t3. Manufacturing methods should
have promise for producing contrast agents at a cost that is comparable
with that of current imaging agents for MRI.\n\n\tNIST seeks
applications that address the issues identified above, as well as
methods that streamline wafer based manufacturing (such as
nano-imprinting), use roll-to-roll transfer techniques, use chemical
synthesis approaches, or a combination of any of the above.\n\n\tPhase I

for producing contrast agents that have sensitivity and functionality

efficiency of high-power lasers is revolutionizing manufacturing in the
U.S. and around the world. Multi-kilowatt lasers are now routinely used
for welding, cutting, and additive manufacturing. Precision control of
these processes, and thus the uniform quality of the manufactured
product, requires a meter that can measure the power of such lasers with
 an uncertainty of only a few percent. Historically, NIST&amp;rsquo;s
standards for power measurements of high-power lasers have been massive
thermal detectors [1]. While suitably accurate, their size, cost, and
technical characteristics (e.g. temporal response) are not optimal for
use in manufacturing operations. For example, an important goal is to
incorporate a power meter into the head of a laser welder, measuring the
 output power in real time and without sacrificing laser power or beam
quality.\n\n\tNIST seeks further innovation to improve the
state-of-the-art, leading to the commercialization of smaller, faster,

approach would be a device based on our recent demonstration showing
that the inherent force in light (radiation pressure) can be exploited
to measure high-power lasers in a manner that could be 1\/10th the cost,

 system that has micrometer resolution, an image field of 50 to 200
micrometers, and a depth of focus that ensures image quality over the
field of view of interest. Such a system must have a working distance of
 nominally 20 cm, image an object that is in vacuum, and potentially
have flexibility to work around obstructed sight paths.\n\n\tTo set the
context, NIST is interested in developing new methods to fabricate
atomically precise electronic devices. One of the primary challenges in
this field, however, is in connecting these atomic-scale devices to
macroscopic electrical contacts, enabling external measurement and
additional fabrication steps. A new advance that links the atomic scale
fabrication to macroscopic processes via imaging and fiducial markings
is needed. Ideas for solving this challenge include stereo microscopy, a
 through-focus 3-D image reconstruction capability, and
vacuum-compatible optical imaging. A product developed under this
subtopic should be marketable as a tool for those doing research in
atomic-scale devices, and ultimately in their commercial
production.\n\n\tThe goal is to develop a solution to locating 50 nm
sized features relative to larger fiducial markings, enabling future
measurement and process steps on tools such as an SEM-based, e-beam
lithography system. The objective is to design an imaging system that
enables the relative position of near atomic scale features and their
local contacts to be accurately determined to several nanometers of

Additive Manufacturing",
        "description": "\n\tNIST seeks the development of tools that
rely on a suite of physics-based and empirical models to support
predictive analyses of metal-based additive manufacturing (AM) processes
 and products.&amp;nbsp; Physics-based models will be developed in such a
 way to ensure reusability in a predictive environment, irrespective of
product geometry.&amp;nbsp; The tool will support reliable and
repeatable microstructure and performance predictions for various
geometries for a given process and material.&amp;nbsp; Such a tool
should:\n\n\t\n\t\tProvide a set of physics-based and empirical models
for metal powder-bed fusion manufacturing
processes.&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tDemonstrate scaling and composability of
such models to support geometry-independent
reusability.\n\t\n\t\tProvide ranges of parameter values for which
models can be assumed reliable and accurate.\n\t\n\t\tProvide support
for in situ feedback to allow for real-time adjustments during
manufacture.\n\n\n\tThe successful development of such a tool will
provide industry with a mechanism to move away from empirical testing
and instead rely more on modeling and simulation, enabled primarily by
measurement science underpinnings.&amp;nbsp; As a potential means for
qualifying AM parts, the tool will support NIST&amp;rsquo;s mission by
reducing AM part lead-times and enabling SME&amp;rsquo;s to expand their
 market participation.\n\n\tIndustry relies heavily on the manufacturing
 of coupons to qualify metal parts created using AM processes.&amp;nbsp;
 Predictive models provide a means for industry to move away from their
dependence on testing and towards an environment supported by models and
 simulation.&amp;nbsp; The transition to modeling and simulation for
part qualification is underway, albeit very cautiously and
deliberately.&amp;nbsp; Current qualification through modeling and
simulation is achieved only with very specific models deployed under
very specific circumstances.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe goal of this project is
to develop a tool that will support the broader application of
physics-based and empirical models as a means for product
qualification.&amp;nbsp; This will be achieved by developing sets of
composable models, each model accompanied with clear application
boundaries.&amp;nbsp; These models must be composable to a level of
granularity that microstructure, and to an extent performance, can be
predicted to a degree of certainty, for a given set of process
parameters and irrespective of geometry.&amp;nbsp; This tool will be an
early step in allowing industry to move away from 100% testing and
towards reliable modeling and simulation in AM.\n\n\tAs AM nears
production-ready capabilities, advancements in modeling and simulation
have become increasingly necessary.&amp;nbsp; Many institutions,
especially universities and small companies, do not have the resources
to test each part created.&amp;nbsp; Nor do these institutions have the
resources for developing reliable predictive models.&amp;nbsp;
Development for this tool will focus on support for composable modeling
for metal powder bed fusion processes, including direct metal laser
sintering and selective laser melting, though the principles applied
during its development should support broader applications.&amp;nbsp;
Therefore, one goal of this project will be to provide a foundation for
developing similar tools in the future for other processes, including
those that build parts using polymer-based processes.\n\n\tPhase I
activities and expected results:\n\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of a set of
parameterized, composable models to support predictive analysis in a
proof-of-concept operating environment.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of a
specified set of operating conditions for which the models are
applicable, including the degree of certainty that they are able to
predict performance.\n\t\n\t\tDemonstration of model composability and
reliability by predicting the microstructure, to a specified degree of
certainty, for several basic shapes.\n\t\n\t\tPrediction of fabricated
part performance of several basic shapes, to a specified degree of

results:\n\n\t\n\t\tDemonstration of automated or semi-automated model
composition to predict microstructure to a specified degree of
certainty.\n\t\n\t\tDemonstration of identification of in situ
adjustments based on real-time predictive analysis.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment
 of a tool from which models can be rapidly called and stored on

from the Measurement Science for Additive Manufacturing Program in the

fundamental measurement science for this predictive tool.&amp;nbsp; This

predictive modeling for manufacturing with metal powder bed fusion
processes, similar to how finite element analysis is used in
conventional machining.\n\n\tReferences:\n\n\t1. Pollock, Neil, and

wide-interest and the subject of many research and development efforts,
the capability of directly imaging the propagating electromagnetic waves
 in a device is not available.\n\n\tTransmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM) is the gold standard technique in spatially-resolved

time-resolved technique1, 2. If the TEM had the power to obtain
nanoscale spatial resolution and collect images at high sampling rates,
entirely new modes of observation and investigation will become
available.\n\n\tThe goal of this project is to enable imaging of
periodic, ultrafast phenomena at GHz frequencies and sub-nanometer
spatial resolution to enable new measurements for magnetic data storage,
 advanced materials, electrochemical systems, and wireless

monochromatic scattering of neutrons and x-rays has been pyrolytic
graphite crystals (PG). PG has the disadvantages of scattering higher
order wavelengths and it has only two useful reflections (002 and 004)
that limit flexibility in desired wavelength and resolution.&amp;nbsp;
If the properties of germanium crystals could be tuned so that the
reflectivity performance is comparable or superior to PG, then germanium
 would replace PG for many applications with improved performance and
flexibility, since it rejects higher order wavelength contamination and
has a much larger range of useful lattice spacings than PG. NIST seeks a
 new processing technology to make the performance of germanium
comparable to that of PG.\n\n\tThe main goal of this project is to find a
 manufacturing technique that can improve the scattering performance of
germanium crystals. The NIST Center for Neutron Research would serve as
the main bridge for this project by testing the germanium crystal
performance.\n\n\tPhase I would consist of completing feasibility tests
to find a manufacturing technique that is promising. This means the
production of germanium crystals with peak reflectivities comparable to
those of pyrolytic graphite (0.6 and higher) and mosaics in the range
15&amp;rsquo; to 40&amp;rsquo;.&amp;nbsp; The NCNR neutron scattering

 for 1 \u03bcm to 4.5 \u03bcm",
        "description": "\n\tRemote-sensing systems for Earth monitoring
often detect infrared radiation in the 2 &amp;mu;m to 2.5 &amp;mu;m and
the 3 &amp;mu;m to 5 &amp;mu;m atmospheric windows, where radiation
absorption is low. Calibrating such systems can be more difficult than
calibrating optical systems that use visible light,
because&amp;mdash;among other reasons&amp;mdash;a type of measurement
standard that is available for visible light is not yet available for
this spectral range. This subtopic is referring to so-called
&amp;ldquo;trap&amp;rdquo; detectors. A &amp;ldquo;trap&amp;rdquo;
detector includes an assembly of photodiodes (or similar devices)
arranged such that, in optical series, they adsorb (that is,
&amp;ldquo;trap&amp;rdquo;) virtually all incident radiation. (Only a
very small fraction of the incident radiation is lost due to reflection
out of the detector.) The references, below, show examples of such
designs.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tTrap detectors have proven to be highly
useful as precision standards for measuring optical power (and related
quantities, such as irradiance) in the visible and ultraviolet
wavelength ranges. An enabling technology was the silicon photodiode,
once they became available sufficiently large and with sufficient
spatial uniformity. However, until recently, sufficiently large and
uniform photodetectors for infrared radiation were not
available.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tNIST believes that this is changing, and
 that detectors made with infrared-sensitive materials (e.g. InAs,
GaInAsSb, etc.) are within the state-of-the-art in large area (e.g., 1.5
 cm2 active area) and with a spatial variability of internal quantum
efficiency of less than 0.1 % between 1 &amp;mu;m and 4.5 &amp;mu;m. In
addition, the internal quantum efficiency of the detectors (i.e., the
device efficiency after taking into account the radiation loss due to
front-surface reflection) must be close to
unity.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe goals of the project are to engineer,
build, and demonstrate a trap-detector design that takes advantage of
modern uniform, large-area infrared detectors. Ultimately, the goal is
for the awardee to market such detectors to the infrared measurement
community, for applications including radiation thermometry. The trap
detectors must be useable at ambient temperatures of &amp;ndash;20
&amp;deg;C and warmer, having internal thermo-electric coolers. The goal
 is to have a spatial uniformity of response over the input aperture of
0.1% or better at all wavelengths between 1 &amp;mu;m and 4.5 &amp;mu;m,
 where the source is a tunable laser beam of 0.2 mm diameter. An
unvignetted acceptance angle of at least 7&amp;deg; is required. An
ideal trap detector (3-element reflectance, 6-element tunnel, etc.)
would have a 5 mm diameter precision entrance aperture. The design task
includes precision electronics to accurately sum the signals from the
individual photodetectors.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I activities and

        "topic_name": "A Verifier for Multicore C11 or C++11 Code",
        "description": "\n\tThe 2011 ISO\/IEC standards for C [1] (C11)
and C++ [2] (C++11) introduced a portable, relaxed multithreaded memory
model. Instead of guaranteeing sequential consistency [3] for all legal
(data-race-free) programs, these standards allow each atomic shared
memory operation to specify the degree of memory consistency it
requires. The compiler has to add only the synchronization needed to
achieve the specified degree of consistency on a given architecture. The
 compiler also gains the freedom to reorder shared memory operations
within a thread. With per-core processing throughput stagnant but core
counts growing, engineers increasingly use this technology (in
combination with lock-free synchronization [4]) to improve system
performance, responsiveness and robustness, to reduce power consumption,
 and to maintain scalability on modern multicore and many-core
processors. With the dominant role of C\/C++ in systems software, much
of our computing infrastructure (and many of our devices) will depend on
 such code.\n\n\tValidating code written to the new model is difficult
[5]. Beyond the usual problems of validating multithreaded code (e.g.,
an exponentially growing number of possibly relevant schedules), the new
 freedoms granted to compilers and hardware make thorough testing of a
library practically impossible, since a bug might manifest only under
some specific compiler or hardware reordering. This makes quality
assurance and certification of libraries or systems containing such code
 by testing alone infeasible.\n\n\tThe only practical approach to this
assurance challenge is formal verification, that is, a verification tool
 proves mathematically (typically guided by annotations provided by the
software maker) that code meets its formal specifications. Because the
software maker has done the hard work (annotation), a customer or
certification authority can check the code for correctness by simply
running the verifier on the annotated code, without having to trust the
software maker. Thanks to improvements in technology, deductive
verification is now practical for realistic code, and has been used to
verify sophisticated software such as OS kernels [6], optimizing
compilers [7], and concurrent system-level code [8].\n\n\tA practical
and sound deductive verifier for C11\/C++11 code would allow library
writers and device engineers to conclusively prove, to customers and
certification authorities, that their code indeed meets its functional
specifications. Such proofs enable development of an ecosystem of
portable, trustworthy, and efficient software libraries.\n\n\tHard
real-time guarantees are critical in some cybersecurity applications
(e.g., to prove availability), as well as in software embedded in
medical devices, manufacturing, and advanced communications.&amp;nbsp;
While real-time behavior is inherently nonportable and goes beyond the
language standards, verification support for real-time properties would
greatly extend the utility of the verifier.\n\n\tThe goal of this
project is to construct a practical verifier for C11 and\/or C++11, and
to demonstrate its practicality. The verifier should have the following
properties:\n\n\t\n\t\tThe verifier targets C11 or a subset of C++11
with at least the full capabilities of C11.\n\t\n\t\tThe verifier allows
 specification and sound verification of functional
correctness.\n\t\n\t\tVerification is driven by specifications, and
perhaps additional annotations, in the code itself; these annotations
should be sensible to engineers.\n\t\n\t\tThe verification methodology
respects standard modular programming practice, such as information
hiding, data abstraction, and separate specification\/verification of
libraries and concurrent components.\n\t\n\t\tThe verification
methodology supports specification of the behavior of external entities
(e.g. devices) with which the software is designed to interact (e.g.,
through memory-mapped I\/O), and verification of the behavior of the
combined system.\n\t\n\t\t(optional) Verification may support
specification and verification of real-time guarantees, based on Worst
Case Execution Time (WCET) assumptions expressed through
annotations.\n\n\n\tNIST emphasizes that the desired outcome of the
project is a practical tool that can be used as an aide to produce
efficient, verified code, particularly libraries. NIST is interested in
the utility of the tool, not in the novelty of the underlying
technology.\n\n\tPhase I activities and expected results:\n\n\tThe Phase
 I project should produce a verifier design (architecture and
specification), a methodology for its use, a full-scale prototype
development plan, and evidence that the proposed verifier can be built
and will meet the project goals. The evidence should include examples of
 how code might be annotated to verify programs using\n\t&amp;nbsp;(1)
standard program control structures (references to stack\/heap objects,
loops, function calls, framing, termination, etc.), (2) data structures
(structs\/unions, abstraction, type invariants, etc.), (3) concurrency
(locks, weak memory types, lock-free data structures, linearizability,
etc.), (4) external devices\/entities (modelling, verification of the
composite system), and optionally (5) real-time constraints.&amp;nbsp;
The Phase I report should also describe some possible verification
examples to be tackled in Phase II, and outline how these examples would
 be verified using the proposed methodology.\n\n\tPhase II activities
and expected results:\n\tPhase II work should consist of construction of
 a prototype verifier based on the design proposed in phase I, and
demonstration of the verifier on some small but interesting examples.
The prototype should cover the essential programming mechanisms of C11
(and, in particular, should handle the C11 memory model), but need not
cover all language features. Suitable demonstration examples include
lock-free hashtables (using hazard pointers), a toy infusion pump, a
robust flash-based key-value store, etc.\n\n\tNIST will have staff
available to discuss reasonable subsets of C11 or C++11, possible types
of example software to verify, and usable specification and annotation
formalisms.\n\n\tReferences:\n\n\t1. ISO\/IEC 9899:2011 &amp;ndash;

        "topic_name": "Access Control Policy Tool",
        "description": "\n\tNearly all applications that deal with
financial, privacy, safety, or defense include some form of access
control. Access control is concerned with determining the allowed
activities of legitimate users, mediating every attempt by a user to
access a resource in the system. Access control policies are high-level
requirements that specify how access is managed and who may access
information under what circumstances [1]. For instance, policies may
pertain to resource usage within or across organizational units or may
be based on need-to-know, competence, authority, obligation, or
conflict-of-interest factors.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tAccess control
policies are increasingly written in policy specification languages such
 as XACML [2] and enforced through a Policy Decision Point (PDP)
implementation. Some example PDP implementations include Sun XACML [3]
and XACML .NET [4]. In such a way, the correctness of specified access
control policies plays a crucial role in assuring adequate security. One
 of the techniques for increasing confidence on the correctness of
access control policies is to conduct systematic policy testing:
requests as test inputs and responses as test
outputs.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThere are two fundamental
problems in systematic policy testing: (1) coverage criteria such as
structural coverage criteria [5] to decide the adequacy of test inputs
and decide when to stop testing and (2) request generation to satisfy
coverage criteria and detect faults in policies.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tTo
 provide high security confidence levels for the nation&amp;rsquo;s
critical IT infrastructure, it is important to provide a tool, which can
 thoroughly and automatically check the syntactic and semantic faults of
 AC policies before deploying them for operation. NIST&amp;rsquo;s
effort of developing the tool &amp;ndash; Access Control Policy Tool
(ACPT) &amp;minus; [6] provides (1) GUI templates for composing AC
policies, (2) property checking for AC policy models through an SMV
(Symbolic Model Verification) model checker, (3) complete test suite
generated by NIST&amp;rsquo;s combinatorial testing tool ACTS [7], and
(4) XACML policy generation as output of verified model. Through the
four major functions, ACPT performs all the syntactic and semantic
verifications as well as the interface for composing and combining AC
rules for AC policies; ACPT assures the efficiency of specified AC
policies, and eliminates the possibility of making faulty AC policies
that leak the privacy information or prohibit legitimate information
sharing. To enhance the usability (comparing with ACPT) a tool with
additional user interfaces, policy importing, and general security
property specification capabilities need to be
developed.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tIn addition to fundamental functions for
 verification and testing of access control models as provided by ACPT,
advanced features are required for more capable and flexible use of
access control policy tool. NIST seeks development of additional access
control policy test capabilities, which may include: (1) easy and
general user interface for policy property specification, (2)
specification of object attributes inheritance relations, (3) more
granular property verification results, (4) API or mechanism for
acquiring or consuming information about users attributes, resources,
environment, and inheritance relations, (5) more policy combination
algorithms, (6) import XACML policies, (7) running under OSX and Linux
in addition to Window system. (Awardee is encouraged to use
NIST&amp;rsquo;s ACPT as the baseline system for the project, ACPT web

        "topic_name": "Analysis and Visualization Tools for Automated
Email Abuse Reports",
        "description": "\n\tEmail coming from spoofed senders (referred
to as phishing) is often used to inject malware into an
enterprise.&amp;nbsp; Several new technologies have been proposed to
combat phishing by having the sending domain state its sending policy
and vouch for sent email [1] [2].&amp;nbsp; Recently, a consortium of
email providers developed a new technique called Domain-Based Message
Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) [3] [4] that allows
sending domains to advertise their anti-phishing policies and provides a
 means to report global validation results of those policies back to the
 sending domains.&amp;nbsp; This enables the sender to see how its
anti-phishing techniques are interpreted by outside receivers as well as
 receive alerts if a phishing campaign has been launched using their
domain as the spoofed sender.\n\n\tDMARC has two key
functions:&amp;nbsp; First, the ability to authoritatively state the
email sending policy and security technologies in use for a sender, and
second, to set up a means to receive reports from recipients about email
 streams and (possible) intercepted phishing attacks. This standardized
way of stating where to send abuse reports is very powerful and allows a
 domain to be alerted when a third party (i.e. an attacker) is spoofing
their domain when sending email to a victim.&amp;nbsp; This reporting
allows for a more coordinated response and aids in investigation of the
incident.\n\n\tCurrently, there is a lack of tools available for domain
owners to parse and extract data from forensic reports.&amp;nbsp; A
phishing campaign conducted against one or several organizations could
consist of hundreds or thousands of spoofed emails.&amp;nbsp; These
emails could come from various sources and forensic reports could
identify the possible origin of the attacks. Forensic reports from
different sources could be used to identify botnets in use and other
intelligence that can be used to stop the campaign as quickly as
possible.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe goal of the project is to design, develop
and test a tool that takes multiple forensic reports (possibly stored in
 a database) and extract statistics and any other useful
intelligence.&amp;nbsp; The tool should also have dashboard front end
that gives the user a quick summary of current or recent sets of
forensic reports as well as alleged sources and targets. The tool should
 also allow a user to query for a set of reports based on date(s),
target, or other relevant criteria. The tool should also allow for
exporting of data and reports.\n\n\tTools to do other functions of DMARC
 are out of the scope for this project, but the tool may need to
integrate into other DMARC reporting tools.\n\n\tPhase I consists of
designing, and documenting a database and associated processes and
algorithms used to parse and analyze a collection of forensic reports.
DMARC forensic reports are sent as an XML formatted file, but could be
stored in a different format that allows for more flexibility in
searching if necessary.&amp;nbsp; Phase I also consists of developing
and designing a dashboard front end to the tool that presents a
visualization of key statistics and allows a user to perform searches
over the report database.\n\n\tPhase II consists of more robust
development of the report analyzing tool and user front end.&amp;nbsp;
The front end should be cross platform or accessed via a web
browser.\n\n\tNIST will be available to act as subject matter experts in
 DMARC andDomain Name System(DNS) as needed.&amp;nbsp; NIST would also
be available to help test the developed algorithm or system as
necessary.\n\n\tReferences:\n\n\t1. S. Kitterman. Sender Policy

        "topic_name": "Improving Robustness and Security in Home
Routers",
        "description": "\n\tThe majority of small offices and homes
connect to the Internet through a so-called small office\/home office
router (SOHO). These systems run their own embedded software and provide
 basic network services for a small network: both wireless and wired.
This embedded software is usually proprietary to the manufacture, but
open source SOHO router software exists [1][2]. These open source
implementations often use (modified) well-known software packages to
provide common network functions for a home network.\n\n\tRecent
security research has been focused on addressing vulnerabilities in
embedded systems through penetration testing [3]. While very useful,
penetration testing may not fully exercise all the individual components
 that are part of the router firmware. A more thorough testing of the
open source components may be able to uncover and address issues like
&amp;quot;Heartbleed&amp;quot; that compromised every system that relied
 on OpenSSL for Transport Layer Security (TLS) [4].\n\n\tWhile there has
 been some recent research focused on assessing the vulnerabilities in
SOHO routers [3], there has been little research or development focused
on how SOHO routers could significantly improve the security posture of
home networks.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Customer premise \/ SOHO routers can
serve as innovation platforms, implementing leading edge security
services on behalf of the wide range of systems (e.g., computers,
appliances, sensors) that they connect to the Internet.&amp;nbsp; For
example, a router can detect that a secure connection to a particular
website or service is possible and proxy a secure connection to that
site, even though the originating host did not choose to use a secure
connection.&amp;nbsp; In effect, acting as a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM),
only this MITM improves overall security rather than launching
attacks.\n\n\tThe new SOHO router capabilities of interest
include:\n\n\t\n\t\tAbility to intercept and provide opportunistic
encryption for protocols that can optionally use TLS (e.g. HTTP), but
are instead operating in an insecure mode.&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tSupport of
 DANE (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities) [5] techniques for
discovery, retrieval and validation of keying material.\n\t\n\t\tAbility
 to act as aDomain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) validating
cache.\n\t\n\t\tAbility to utilize DNS privacy techniques such as query
minimization.\n\t\n\t\tFull support of IPv6 [6] and HomeNet [7] router
standards.\n\t\n\t\tFull support for current requirements [8] for
customer edge routers.\n\t\n\t\tAbility to intercept traffic going to
known malware sites to prevent data exfiltration and\/or infected host
systems from communicating with Command &amp;amp; Control
sites.\n\n\n\tThe goal of the project is to design, develop and test a
set of security tools that are part of the embedded system of a home
router.&amp;nbsp; These tools will allow the home router to act as a
security proxy to protect insecure systems on a home network.&amp;nbsp;
The tools should have little or no necessary user bootstrap
configuration but should be able to work without user action (although a
 user could alter the configuration if desired).\n\n\tPhase I consists
of identifying a suitable open source SOHO router implementation and
performing a full security analysis of the candidate software.&amp;nbsp;
 Any vulnerability discovered should be documented and reported as
necessary (e.g. to the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) if
found to be a vulnerability to a widely used package). The second part
would be to produce a plan on how to include new capabilities for new
security services in home router firmware. A proof of concept version of
 code should be developed to insure correctness and for testing, but
does not need to necessarily be already part of the embedded software in
 the home router.\n\n\tPhase II consists of more robust development of
the code based on the architecture developed in Phase I.&amp;nbsp; A new
 branch of the candidate open source router firmware should be used as
the code base.\n\n\tNIST will be available to act as subject matter
experts in DNS, DNSSEC and DANE as needed.&amp;nbsp; NIST would also be
available to help set up testing and evaluation of any algorithm or
finished code as necessary.\n\n\tReferences: \n\t1. OpenWrt, a Linux

 Coherent Raman Imaging",
        "description": "\n\tBroadband Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman
Scattering &amp;nbsp;(BCARS) [1-5] offers noninvasive, label-free,
three-dimensional chemical imaging of materials and biological systems.
Single-frequency Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS)
microscopy, introduced in 1999, also offers 3D label-free imaging, but
does not provide the chemical sensitivity that is so important in
complex biological systems.\n\n\tDiscrimination of critical chemical
composition changes in biological tissues (e.g. for diagnostics), and
analysis of complex materials requires spectral data over a wide
frequency range. Spectral range in the vibrational fingerprint region
(500 cm-1 to 1800 cm-1) offered by BCARS makes possible label-free
imaging and the chemical sensitivity needed to fully characterize subtle
 changes in biological and material systems that are concomitant with
processes of interest such as disease progress and cellular
differentiation.\n\n\tRecent innovations in experimental technique and
improvements in data analysis have brought the possibility of widespread
 use of BCARS much closer. The new techniques developed by NIST are
based on a &amp;ldquo;3-color&amp;rdquo; CARS signal generation
mechanism that relies on intrapulse generation of vibrational coherence
in the sample [6] that produces signals in the fingerprint spectral
region with unprecedented strength and clarity.&amp;nbsp; While this new
 approach is very powerful, it requires advanced performance from the
laser system and significant complexity in the detection scheme.
Commercialization of such a BCARS system is presently untenable due to
the complexity of the laser sources and supporting apparatus.\n\n\tIn
order to remove a crucial barrier to commercialization and wide
dissemination of BCARS microscopy, proposals are invited for design
studies of a user-friendly laser source for a time-domain coherent Raman
 spectroscopy instrument. The characteristics of the desired laser
source are given below:\n\n\tNIST seeks development of a laser that
would produce two broadband laser pulses (bandwidth of &amp;gt;3000
cm-1) with spectral content between 930 nm and 1400 nm, with repetition
rates that are mismatched by a precise and time-invariant offset. Highly
 stabilized dual-comb laser systems are available commercially, and are
used for applications such as optical clocks, however they are very
expensive, and use the wrong wavelengths for coherent Raman imaging. The
 system we propose would have relaxed specifications for absolute
repetition rate, and could be manufactured at much lower cost than the
commercially available comb lasers. Also, availability of such a laser
would make performing BCARS microscopy quite straightforward.\n\n\tThe
goals of the proposed work are to demonstrate feasibility for design and
 construction of a single turnkey laser source that would be suitable
for time-domain coherent Raman spectroscopy, and to demonstrate its
reliability.\n\n\tPhase I activities and expected results: Design a
dual-pulse laser source to have the following characteristics:\n\n\tTwo
trains of broadband, compressible laser pulses, each with repetition
rate of approximately 500 -MHz, but with a fixed repetition rate
mismatch 0.1 MHz, where each pulse train contains pulses
that:\n\n\t\n\t\tHave &amp;gt; 3000 wavenumbers of spectral bandwidth
between 930 nm and 1400 nm\n\t\n\t\tAre compressible to near transform
limit (&amp;lt; 10 fs)\n\t\n\t\tHave average power of at least 150
mW\n\t\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\tStability of the difference in repetition
rates of the two pulse trains is better than 0.001 over a 1 hour time
period.\n\n\tDemonstrate that individual components of the laser system
can function independently\n\n\tPhase II activities and expected
results: Assemble and test the laser system for the
following:\n\n\t\n\t\tPulse compressibility\n\t\n\t\tPulse power
stability\n\t\n\t\tRepetition rate mismatch stability\n\n\n\tNIST will
be available for consultation on progress and
performance.\n\n\tReferences:\n\n\t1. T. W. Kee and M. T. Cicerone,

agencies, Phase III may involve follow-on, non-SBIR funded R&amp;amp;D,
or production contracts for products or processes intended for use by
the U.S. Government.\n\n\tThe competition for SBIR Phase I and Phase II
awards satisfies the competition requirement of the Armed Services
Procurement Act, the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act,
and the Competition in Contracting Act. Therefore, an agency that wishes
 to fund an SBIR Phase III project is not required to conduct another
competition in order to satisfy those statutory provisions. As a result,
 in conducting actions relative to a Phase III SBIR award, it is
sufficient to state for purposes of a Justification and Approval
pursuant to FAR 6.302-5 that the project is a SBIR Phase III award that
is derived from, extends, or logically concludes efforts performed under
 prior SBIR funding agreements and is authorized under 10 U.S.C.
2304(b)(2) or 41 U.S.C. 253(b)(2).\n\n\tThis Funding Opportunity
Announcement (FOA) issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), and the Administration for Children and Families
(ACF) invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to
submit Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I, Phase II,
Fast-Track (NIH only), and Phase IIB Competing Renewal (NIH only) grant
applications.\n\n\tThe PHS 2014-2 SBIR\/STTR Program Descriptions and
Research Topics for NIH, CDC, FDA, and ACF represent scientific program
areas that may be of interest to applicant SBCs in the development of
projects that have potential for commercialization. Small business
concerns that have the research capabilities and technological expertise
 to contribute to the R&amp;amp;D mission(s) of the NIH, CDC, FDA, or
ACF awarding components identified in this FOA are encouraged to submit
SBIR grant applications in these areas. SBIR grant applications will
also be accepted and considered in any area within the mission of the
Components of Participating Organizations listed for this FOA. In
addition to the general research areas described above some NIH awarding
 components have identified additional, specific SBIR funding
opportunities of potential interest to SBCs. See the NIH Special
Announcements for Small Business Research
Opportunities.&amp;nbsp;Applicants are not required to identify a
potential awarding component prior to submission of the application, but
 may request one in a cover letter. Staff within the NIH&amp;rsquo;s
Center for Scientific Review (CSR) office, the single receiving point
for all NIH, FDA, CDC, and ACF grant applications, will assign all
applications to the most appropriate Agency and&amp;nbsp;
Institute\/Center (IC) based on their mission and the science
proposed.\n\n\tSome of the NIH ICs offer the opportunity to submit Phase
 IIB Competing Renewal applications that will provide additional funding
 for Phase II SBIR projects. These renewals are typically offered for
those projects that require regulatory approval for the product or
service being developed or to support complex instrumentation, clinical
research tools, and behavioral interventions\/treatments. For those ICs
that included these opportunities in the PHS 2014-2 SBIR\/STTR Program
Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, FDA, and ACF,
applications will be accepted through this Parent SBIR FOA. All others
must be submitted in response to the specific FOA released by the IC.
See the NIH Special Announcements for Small Business Research
Opportunities for a list of these unique SBIR funding
opportunities.\n\n\tGovernment-wide SBIR policy is provided by the Small
 Business Administration (SBA) through its SBIR Program Policy
Directive. Federal agencies with extramural research and development
budgets over $100 million annually are required to administer SBIR
programs using a set-aside of 2.9% (FY2015) for small companies to
conduct innovative R\/R&amp;amp;D that has potential for
commercialization and public benefit.\n\n\tThe SBIR\/STTR
Reauthorization Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-81) provides for new provisions
for the SBIR program, some of which are available in this FOA.&amp;nbsp;
 NIH is implementing the provisions in the reauthorization and an
information website is available.\n\n\t\n\t\tThis FOA can now accept a
Phase II or Phase IIB SBIR submission, where the previous award was an
STTR Phase I or II respectively. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Please contact a
program official to discuss this option.\n\t\n\t\tThis FOA cannot accept
 a &amp;quot;Direct Phase II&amp;quot; SBIR submission.&amp;nbsp; When
implemented, this option will only be available in specific FOAs and
will be posted at the NIH Special Announcements for Small Business
Research Opportunities website.\n\n\n\tFrequently asked questions are
available to assist applicants and can answer many basic questions about
 the program.&amp;nbsp;\n",

technology, including clothing, jewelry and other devices with broadly
diverse functions that meet medical or consumer needs. This FOA seeks
applications from small businesses that propose to design and produce a
wearable device to monitor blood alcohol levels in real
time.\n\n\tAlcohol detection technology for personal alcohol monitoring
has been successful in judicial and law enforcement settings, yet needs
significant modification for wider use in other situations. Current
technological developments in electronics, miniaturization, wireless
technology, and biophysical techniques of alcohol detection in humans
increase the likelihood of successful development of a useful alcohol
biosensor in the near future.\n\n\tThe alcohol biosensor device should
be unobtrusive, appealing to the wearer, and can take the form of
jewelry, clothing, or any other format located in contact with the human
 body. A non-invasive technology is preferred.\n\n\tThe device should be
 able to quantitate blood alcohol level, and interpret and store the
data or transmit it to a smartphone or other device by wireless
transmission. The device should have the ability to verify
standardization at regular intervals and to indicate loss of
functionality. The power source should be dependable and rechargeable.
Data storage and transmission must be completely secure in order to
protect the privacy of the individual. A form of subject identification
would be an added benefit. The device can be removable.\n\n\tIt is
envisioned that wearable alcohol monitors will serve useful purposes in
research, clinical, and treatment settings, will play a role in public
safety, and will be of interest to individuals interested in keeping
track of personal health parameters. &amp;nbsp;\n",

helmet to be uncomfortable. Helmets may be especially uncomfortable when
 worn in warm weather. Manufacturing helmets with ventilation systems
that improve comfort and also meet safety standards is challenging. For
