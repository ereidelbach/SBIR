Impact and Abrasion Resistance of Transparent Armor",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The Phase II effort shall result in a
 novel polymer based transparent composite material that will be
integrateable to the top, outer layer of the glass windshield or
transparent armor in both commercial and military applications.  This
layer shall be designed to defeat rock strike threats and enhance
transparent armor performance by reducing susceptibility to repetitive
damage and latent cracks caused by rock and debris.     DESCRIPTION: One
 of the common problems for military convoys in remote and desert areas
is windshield and transparent armor damage caused by stones flying off
the wheels of other vehicles.  Cracked or broken windshields need to be
repaired or replaced with new ones, which causes logistical problems.
The minor, but repetitive, damage and latent cracks caused by the stones
 significantly reduces the ability of the transparent armor panel to
defeat other rock strikes and ballistic projectiles.  To address these
problems, this solicitation requests the development of an innovative
transparent and tough nanocomposite laminate that can be added on top of
 the outer glass to prevent windshield crack or breakage from road
hazards, and reduce latent damage to the transparent armor.  This
development should ideally exploit innovative materials, designs,
and\/or manufacturing processes to create a light but tough transparent
outer layer.      Synthetic materials that take advantage of
manufacturing techniques to develop fiber-based materials with three
dimensional axial control including weaving techniques are of interest
for this project.  Recent advances in this area have resulted in
development of materials with superior properties in strength,
stiffness, toughness, and ballistic shock mitigation properties. With
improvement in nanotechnology, discovery and exploitation of various
nanostructures (such as, but not limited to, nanofibers, clay
nanoplateletes, nanotubes, nanowires, etc.), and advances in composites
fabrication processes, it is possible to develop new structures and
materials that can be integrated into a transparent armor system that
can lead to tougher, lighter, and thinner transparent ballistic panels.
 A lighter transparent armor is needed to improve mobility,
maneuverability, and survivability of crew personnel.  The goal of this
solicitation is to develop a new material that can offer enhanced
ballistic protection with at least 30% reduction in weight and
significant reduction in thickness at comparable or reduced cost to
currently fielded transparent armor windows.     PHASE I: Phase I will
consist of a feasibility study of  an innovative design concept for the
development of a polymer based transparent armor protection shield
through the utilization of advanced materials and\/or innovative
fabrication techniques.  The contractor must demonstrate the concept
design by manufacturing at least four (4) 400mm x 400mm prototype
transparent armor shields of the proposed technology.  The panels shall
be tested for ballistic protection according to ATPD 2352R, light weight
 tactical vehicle transparent armor requirements.  The transparent
ballistic panels shall defeat, at a minimum, multi-hit .30 caliber 7.62
mm Armor Piercing bullet threat at 2800 feet per second.  The multi-hit
pattern to be utilized is available in the Army-Tank Purchase
Description (ATPD) 2352.  Transparency requirements include at least 85%
 transmission of the maximum solar emission at 550 nm.  Refraction
coefficient and coefficient of thermal expansion of the materials should
 be similar to that of glass, that is, 1.45 in the 400-800 nm wavelength
 range.  Stability of the index of refraction should be investigated in
the range of -20 C to +40 C.  The transparent armor panels must maintain
 the improved ballistic performance at low temperatures (-40F) and
withstand the thermal cycling testing profile (-60 to 180F).  The
transparent armor panels shall be tested for abrasion resistance on the
exterior surface per section 3.3.6 of ATPD 2352R.  The novel material
shall exhibit optical transparency as stated in the ATPD 2352R
specifications, haze shall be less than 3%.  The phase I panels shall be
 at least 15% lighter than currently fielded transparent armor systems
at comparable or reduced cost.  Additionally, ballistic performance of
the complete transparent armor system shall be equal to, or better, than
 currently fielded systems, as measured by the V50 value of the system.
     PHASE II: Phase II work shall expand on Phase I results through the
 optimization of manufacturing processes and material properties based
on the Phase I proof-of-concept studies, and demonstrate capabilities
for large-scale manufacturing.  Fabricate a minimum of 12 (400mm x400mm)
 coupons for rock strike testing to be conducted by TARDEC IAW ATPD
2352T.  The contractor must verify the rock strike performance of their
solution via testing prior to submitting the coupons to TARDEC.
Additionally, the transparency requirements include at Phase II work
shall expand on Phase I results through the optimization of
manufacturing processes and material properties based on the Phase I
proof-of-concept studies, and demonstrate capabilities for large-scale
manufacturing.  Fabricate a minimum of 12 (400mm x400mm coupons for
ballistic testing to be conducted by TARDEC.  The contractor must verify
 the ballistic performance of their solution via testing prior to
submitting the coupons to TARDEC.  The transparent ballistic panels
shall defeat, at a minimum, multi-hit .30 caliber 7.62 mm Armor Piercing
 bullet threat at 2800 feet per second.  The multi-hit pattern to be
utilized is available in Army-Tank Purchase Description (ATPD) 2352.
The phase II panels shall be at least 30% lighter than currently fielded
 transparent armor systems at comparable or reduced cost.  Additionally,
 ballistic performance of the complete transparent armor system shall be
 equal to, or better, than currently fielded systems, as measured by the
 V50 value of the system.      PHASE III: Development of polymer based
lightweight transparent armor materials will directly impact military
vehicle ballistic resistance capabilities, which can also be adapted to
address civilian defense and automotive safety issues.  Additionally,
such technology will have a broad range of commercial applications in
the airline industry.  The new transparent armor materials will benefit
light weight tactical vehicles by decreasing the amount of transparent
armor replaced due to rock strikes.    The developed concept will be
tested on light- to medium-weight army tactical vehicles with the
potential for the translational implementations.  The commercial market
for the developed composite includes aircrafts, helicopters, the
automotive industry, law enforcement, security vehicles, and security
construction (bank windows, check points, etc.).",

        "topic_name": "Improved Lateral Stability for Unmanned Ground
Vehicle Convoys",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an improved system for
maintaining lateral stability of extended manned and unmanned convoys.
  DESCRIPTION: Current robotic leader follower autonomy methods, when
applied to multi vehicle convoy, often produce trailing vehicle
trajectories unacceptably different from the lead vehicle trajectory.
In military applications, this path deviation error can seriously
endanger convoy mission success and the participating vehicles
themselves, particularly in combat zones. Following vehicles which stray
 from the path are more likely to encounter roadside hazards or
Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) which they would have avoided had
they followed the lead vehicle more precisely.  For such missions,
consistent following performance with lateral tracking errors of
centimeters (Threshold: 20 cm; Objective: 15 cm) is needed.    Some
automated convoy approaches employ a set of sensor packages which
include Global Positioning System (GPS) and inertial sensing installed
on each vehicle. However, simple following of the GPS waypoints laid
down by the lead vehicle does not provide sufficient accuracy and fails
in the absence of good GPS signal. Other methods, in which each vehicle
tracks and follows its predecessor, work well for a few vehicles but do
not scale well to longer convoys (10 or more vehicles), as small
tracking and control errors accumulate with each successive follower. To
 date, fusion of these two approaches has also failed to consistently
achieve the desired accuracy for long convoys.    Tracking of
environmental features (landmarks) has been explored to help address
this problem. In the case that the convoy is driving on roads in good
condition with clearly painted lines, it is possible to exploit computer
 vision lane-tracking technology to enable the following vehicles to
stay on-path by exploiting the markings on the road. Other environmental
 reference features can help when a sufficient number of such features
are present.  A more general solution is needed, though, if the convoy
system is to operate on secondary roads (gravel, dirt, etc.), two track
trails, off road (fields, desert, etc.) or on poorly-marked roads in
cases where the presence of reliable landmarks cannot be guaranteed.
 The ideal solution shall improve on the state of the art for both
convoy relative vehicle localization and control algorithms.  It shall
exploit both inter vehicle sensing (e.g., sensors mounted on one vehicle
 which detect angle and\/or range to other vehicles) and navigation
sensors (e.g., GPS and inertial systems), but it shall not be tied to
specific sensor hardware. Solutions which minimize requirements for
environmental features are preferred.    PHASE I: Design a system that
is capable of using sensors from different manufacturers and software
algorithms for accurate leader-follower behavior in convoys of 10 or
more vehicles.  Convoy operations range in speed from 0 to 55 miles per
hour (mph) with gap distance (the distance between vehicles) from 5 to
125 meters (m).  Use open architecture principles in the system design.
 Feasibility of the approach shall be demonstrated in a simulation
environment across a variety of lead vehicle paths and convoy speeds.
The Phase I deliverable shall include a description of the system
sensing hardware requirements, an analysis of expected system accuracy
across a range of mission conditions, and an analysis of computation
requirements.    PHASE II: Phase II shall implement the Phase I design
for a multi vehicle convoy using Government Furnished Equipment (GFE),
fully robotic tactical wheeled vehicles, to perform a technical
demonstration.  The system shall take advantage of the native onboard
GFE sensors (GPS, Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR), radars, Inertial
Measurement Unit (IMU), wheel encoders, gyro, Ultra-wideband (UWB)
radios, color and Infrared (IR) cameras, Vehicle To Vehicle (V2V) radio)
 to determine its solution.  Adding additional sensors as part of the
solution is discouraged.  The technical demonstration site shall be
provided by the Government in the Contiguous United States (CONUS).  The
 site shall be selected to represent an operationally relevant
environment.  The technical demonstration shall cover full spectrum
operations and shall include long\/short haul duration missions; varying
 from low\/high speeds in different operational conditions.  These
conditions shall include combinations of but not be limited to the
following examples: day and night; raining\/snowing; dust\/fog;
structured and unstructured roads, two track trails and cross country
routes.  The Phase II deliverable shall include a technical report,
software, source code and documentation.    PHASE III:  Development of a
 modular package suitable for both commercial and military use.  Last
year alone there were over 130 billion miles driving in the US alone by
Class 8 commercial trucks.  This type system shall help reduce the
number of accidents where trucks depart from the road.  This could also
be integrated into the military robotics library supporting existing
programs such as the Autonomous Mobility Applique System (AMAS) and
Route Clearance Inspection System (RCIS) Program of Record (PoR).  The
Phase III deliverable shall include a technical report and full
Government Purpose Right (GPR) software, source code and documentation

        "topic_name": "Alternative Energy Sources for Heating Rations",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an alternative method to heat
 rations for echelon sized units while stationary, on the move and at
outlying or remote feeding sites to negate the dependence on fossil fuel
 technology.    DESCRIPTION: The mission of Field Feeding is clearly
stated in the Marine Corps Reference Publication 4-11.8A, Marine Corps
Field Feeding Program and it reads"The Marine Corps Field Feeding
Program supports the Marine Air-Ground Task Force in an expeditionary
environment through flexibility in feeding methods - furnishing the
capability to provide Marines the right meal, at the right place, at the
 right time"(Ref 1-2).  This is especially significant with the recent
article from the CNO and CMC that articulates that the Navy Marine Corps
 team will develop integrated operating concepts for our forces, field
them with compatible equipment, and then deploy them in innovative force
 packages.  Currently, the Marine Corps has systems that provide 250+
meals per sitting to lower echelon sized units.  The Tray Ration Heating
 System (TRHS) and Enhanced Tray Ration Heating System (E-TRHS)
accomplish this reduced mission, but both require the use of fossil fuel
 as well as a power source in order to accomplish the heating of rations
 (Ref. 3).  The current fuel requirement to operate the ration heating
systems for 59 hours is 30 gallons of diesel.  By eliminating the fuel
component, the same 30 gallons could potentially provide 420 miles for
unit mobility or could save $156 for every 59 hours of ration heating
operations per company sized unit deployed or conducting field training.
 Ultimately, eliminating the fuel component contributes to the overall
reduction of combat resupply missions and decreasing the risk of Marines
 being wounded or killed while conducting these missions.  The potential
 benefits of reducing resupply missions was evident from the Logistics
Casualties Study from 24 March 2010 to 30 June 2010 for Marines
conducting combat logistic patrol missions in Iraq. For a period of 3
months, there were 100 resupply missions per month with 2 Marines
wounded in action per month from Improvised Explosive Device (IED)
attacks.             This topic seeks to develop innovative approaches
in the application of alternative energy sources (chemical, thermal,
solar, etc.) capable of heating food rations (140-180 degrees F),
[Unitized Group Rations (UGR) A, B and Heat &amp; Serve (H &amp; S)],
within the same time constraints as the TRHS and E-TRHS (Ref. 4-5).
This effort alone is essential in eliminating the requirement to use
fossil fuel which ultimately equates to fewer combat logistic patrols
and mitigates the chances of Marines being wounded or killed while
conducting resupply missions.  There are existing technologies, such as
solar cookers, that can accomplish the heating of rations using
alternative methods; however, they only provide heating on a small order
 of 200 or less meals and not for multiple sittings.  In order to
replace the fossil fuel for fired burners and electrical heating
systems, the technology must be able to demonstrate its effectiveness on
 a much larger scale, such as heating 250+ meals twice a day.  The new
technology shall have the capability to be transported, mounted and
operational while on the move in all tactical cargo vehicles with
minimum modification to the vehicle.  The new technology shall operate
in all climates and environments that may be encountered such as arctic,
 desert, jungle, and coastal.  There shall be no operational degradation
 when ambient temperatures are between 125 degrees F and -25 degrees F.
 It must operate in all humidity levels up to 100 percent.  It must be
resistant to the effects of salt\/water spray, and extreme sand and dust
 conditions to the extent outlined in MIL-STD-810G (Ref. 1, 2, 6).
Small businesses should be mindful that the performance of any proposed
technology solutions should match or exceed the current ration heating
systems and that life-cycle costs should be maintained at the same level
 or lower as compared  to the current systems.    PHASE I: The small
business will develop concepts for an improved method to heat rations
that meets the requirements described above.  The small business will
demonstrate the feasibility of the concepts in meeting Marine Corps
needs and will establish that the concepts can be developed into a
useful product for the Marine Corps.  Feasibility will be established by
 material testing and analytical modeling, as appropriate.  The small
business will also provide a Phase II development plan with performance
goals, key technical milestones, and a technical risk reduction
strategy.    PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II
development plan, the small business will develop a scaled prototype
evaluation. The prototype will be evaluated to determine its capability
in meeting the performance goals defined in the Phase II development
plan and the Marine Corps requirements for heating rations.  System
performance will be demonstrated through prototype evaluation and
modeling or analytical methods over the required range of parameters
including numerous deployment cycles.  Evaluation results will be used
to refine the prototype into an initial design that will meet Marine
Corps requirements.  The company will prepare a Phase III development
plan to transition the technology to Marine Corps use.    PHASE III: If
Phase II is successful, the small business will be expected to support
the Marine Corps in transitioning the technology for Marine Corps use.
The small business will develop a plan to determine the effectiveness of
 the new method for heating rations in an operationally relevant
environment.  The small business will support the Marine Corps for test
and validation to certify and qualify the system for Marine Corps use.
  PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: The
potential for commercial application is limited to organizations that
heat previously prepared rations.  U.S. Marine Corps Bases and Stations
are linked to state and local disaster response organizations and this
technology would benefit them in supporting displaced personnel in a
larger scale natural disaster relief role.",

        "topic_name": "Reduced Hazard Antenna",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Marine Corps Systems Command seeks
innovative approaches to provide equivalent or better radiation pattern
and omnidirectional gain as existing handheld or manpack radio antennas,
 while providing high voltage protection to reduce the risk of
electrical shocks from low overhead wires for dismounted radio.
DESCRIPTION: Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) provides radio
and antenna material solutions to the Marine Corps. In an operational
environment, dismounted Marines can encounter low-hanging wires such as
unregulated power distribution lines which present the potential for an
electric shock hazard. These lines can be unpredictable in height and
voltage.  Dismounted Marines operate handheld or manpack radios with
long whip (6 to 10 ft.) or blade antennas (3 to 4 ft) (Ref 1 and 2). The
 configurations allow for the possibility of an electrical shock hazard
should direct contact be made with a power line. While whip antennas
exhibit good size and weight characteristics for the performance they
provide, they pose an electrocution risk in these types of environments
due to their length and all metal construction.  Intermediate length
blade antennas are more manageable, but are also not designed for the
electrical safety of the operator.  The development of technology
solutions for this type of environment creates several challenges.
Electrical antennas (monopoles) need to be in upright position to
perform well and display the appropriate omni-directional pattern.
However, doing this increases visual cueing to the enemy.  An operator
in"prone"position (under fire) could also experience substantial
degradation in antenna performance due to reflections off of the ground
plane. While higher amplification could facilitate the use of a shorter
antenna height, this could in turn negatively impact the available
portable battery power carried by each warfighter as higher
amplification would require more available power.  Wearable antenna
solutions (e.g. solution that wraps around the individual) are
available; however, it could potentially pose Hazards of Electromagnetic
 Radiation to Personnel (HERP) concerns. These solutions also are
limited by the use of one frequency band and typically have insufficient
 power for communications.  Loop antennas provide a means to reduce the
height significantly, but with a cross-looped design (such as an
eggbeater), it becomes impractical for an individual to use.  Presently,
 a temporary solution has been deployed but this solution is a simple
antenna sheathing that is considered a temporary work around and not
integrated with the antenna.  There are no robust viable technology
solutions for this ongoing need in the application cited.
MARCORSYSCOM is looking for innovative approaches to reduce the risk to
the operator by providing high-voltage protection to 20KV RMS (35KV RMS
objective) while providing equivalent of better radiation pattern and
omnidirectional gain, regardless of the position of the operator, as
well as a solution that is difficult for the enemy to visually detect.
The desired solution would be the development of an antenna that would
be able to provide protection to the operator from electrocution, while
1) not being readily observable by the enemy, 2) utilized the same or
less power 3) maintain the existing or improve performance, all without
any permanent modifications to the current Marine Corps systems.  Other
potential (but less desirable) technology solutions may include, but are
 not limited to, manpack system redesign to incorporate effective
isolating and\/or grounding features including; the addition of blocking
 capacitors at optimum locations in antennas; use of antennas with less
quantity of conductive material and\/or better insulation\/coatings of
antennas; methods of insulation of radio housing from antenna and\/or
shielding of personnel from radio housing; providing a potential
alternate shielded path to ground.        For maximum range and
reliability, the dismounted Marine requires the antenna to be light and
flexible (Ref 3 and 4).  A collapsible design is not required but would
be helpful for storage and transportation.   The antennas\/solutions of
most interest are for use with handheld and manpack tactical radios in
the High Frequency (HF), lower Very High Frequency (VHF) bands (2 to 88
MHz), and 33-88mhz Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System
(SINCGARS) .   The following handheld and manpack tactical radios use
those above mentioned bands: AN\/PRC-150, AN\/PRC-117F, AN\/PRC-117G and
 AN\/PRC-152 (Ref 3 and 4). The radios use N Type and threaded
NeillConcelman (TNC) antenna connectors. Concepts proposed must not
negatively impact or damage the high voltage wires encountered and must
pass a high voltage performance test.  Proposers should be prepared to
discuss the level of protection their technology solution(s) provides,
the technology used to achieve a proposed level of protection, and any
applicable antenna\/solution performance information.  Proposers should
employ open architecture designs principles as much as is practicable.
Preference will be given to solutions that do not cause permanent
modifications to the current Marine Corps systems.    PHASE I: The
company will develop concepts for an improved antenna meeting the
requirements described above.  The company will demonstrate the
feasibility of the concepts in meeting Marine Corps needs and will
establish the concepts can be developed into a useful product for the
Marine Corps.  Feasibility will be established by material testing and
analytical modeling, as appropriate.  The small business will provide a
Phase II development plan with performance goals and key technical
milestones, and that will address technical risk reduction.    PHASE II:
 Based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II development plan, the
small business will develop a scaled prototype evaluation. The prototype
 will be evaluated to determine its capability in meeting the
performance goals defined in the Phase II development plan and the
Marine Corps requirements for the antenna. System performance will be
demonstrated through prototype evaluation and modeling over the required
 range of parameters including numerous deployment cycles.  Evaluation
results will be used to refine the prototype into an initial design
meeting Marine Corps requirements.  The company will prepare a Phase III
 development plan to transition the technology to Marine Corps use.
PHASE III: If Phase II is successful, the company will be expected to
support the Marine Corps in transitioning the technology for Marine
Corps use.  The company will develop an antenna for evaluation to
determine its effectiveness in an operationally relevant environment.
The company will support the Marine Corps for test and validation to
certify and qualify the system for Marine Corps use.    PRIVATE SECTOR
COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: Municipalities, law
enforcement, and first responders also use radios sharing the same radio
 bands. A reduced size antenna with superior range and performance would
 also be attractive to these applications. Such applications could be
both applied to both handheld or vehicle mounted applications.",

        "topic_name": "Innovative Signal Processing Techniques for
Mitigation of Wind Turbine Farm Interference in Airborne Radar Systems",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop innovative signal processing
techniques for the mitigation of adverse effects on airborne radar
systems resulting from the interference caused by the large radar cross
section of a wind turbine combined with the Doppler frequency shift
produced by its rotating blades which impacts the ability of a radar
system to differentiate a wind turbine from an aircraft.    DESCRIPTION:
 There is growing public and private sector interest in generating
electrical power using wind energy both within the United States and
abroad. Systems that harness wind energy are largely comprised of
installations of multiple wind turbines with rotating blades reaching to
 heights of 500 feet. The quantity, height and rotation of wind turbines
 present technical challenges to the effectiveness of airborne radar
systems. Wind turbine farms located within line of sight of an airborne
radar system have the potential to degrade the ability of that radar to
perform its intended function. The magnitude of the impact will depend
upon the quantity, size, structural properties and location of the wind
turbines. The physical size of the wind turbine blades results in a
substantial radar cross section (RCS) target, irrespective of whether
the blades are viewed face on or edge on by the radar. The tip
velocities for wind turbine blades fall within a speed range applicable
to aircraft and in fact the broadly spread variable Doppler signature of
 the reflected signal from the wind turbine can often exceed that
produced by an aircraft. Consequently, the turbine blades will appear on
 a radar system as a moving target of significant size if they are
within the radar line of sight. Responses cannot be inhibited using
normal moving target indicator (MTI) based techniques since they are
generated by a moving structure of long airfoils resulting in an
extremely complex spectrum of Doppler returns.      Wind turbines in
close proximity to military training, testing, and development sites and
 ranges can adversely impact the ability to test airborne radar systems
and train Navy aviators in the proper operation of airborne radar
systems. Since airborne radar systems are required to work
independently, some of the traditional mitigation techniques used in a
ground based scenario such as gap filling, wind turbine structural
regulation, radio frequency (RF) signature reduction, and environmental
techniques cannot be employed. In order to ensure that airborne radar
systems can continue to function properly in an environment where wind
turbine farm activity will continue to proliferate there is a need to
develop an innovative signal processing technique within the radar
system to mitigate the problems caused by wind farms.    PHASE I:
Identify and define the RF signature from wind turbines in various
configurations. Perform modeling and simulation of the RF returns from
wind turbine farms, and investigate signal processing techniques for
mitigation of wind turbine farm effects.    PHASE II: Develop, test, and
 demonstrate signal processing algorithms for mitigation of wind turbine
 farm effects with simulated wind turbine farm data, and several sets of
 radar data.    PHASE III: Complete testing of the wind turbine farm
mitigation signal processing algorithm and transition the technology to
appropriate platforms.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE
APPLICATIONS: There is a high potential for private sector use of
algorithms developed under this topic. Primary   candidates for dual use
 of wind turbine farm mitigation technology are air traffic control and
weather radar systems that must contend with the issue of interference
resulting from the presence of wind turbines.",

        "topic_name": "Fully Integrated Low Size, Weight, and Power
(SWaP) and Cost Magnetometers for Air and In-Water Anti-Submarine
Warfare (ASW)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a low Size, Weight and Power
(SWaP) and low cost total field scalar magnetometer with all control
electronics fully integrated within the sensor package.  The
magnetometer is targeted for use in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs),
Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs), buoys, in-water arrays, Unmanned
Ground Vehicles (UGV), as well as manned platforms.    DESCRIPTION:
Recent work to reduce the SWaP and cost of magnetometers under SBIRs and
 commercial company Independent Research and Development (IR &amp; D)
funding has resulted in a vast improvement over the current production
military and commercial systems, but still falls short of the optimum
level for UAVs and in-water arrays and other remote sensor applications.
     All current atomic scalar magnetometers consist of a sensor head
(or physics package) that senses the magnetic field and a control
circuit module located some distance away to drive the sensor and
convert the analog sensor signals to useable digital data.  The
separation between the sensor head and control module is required so the
 electro-magnetic effects of the circuit card(s) will not interfere with
 the measurements of the sensor and create additional noise.  While a
significant amount of work has been focused on improved performance of
the sensor head, the control module has been neglected and is still a
design with separate analog, digital, and discrete components.  The
control module is also the major source of power consumption for the
overall system.  This configuration is not optimal for the Navy"s
current interests in unmanned systems, where size, power, and available
volume are at a premium or other noise sources exist.  For example, in a
 UAV or rotary wing platform there are many inherent noise sources such
as motors, servos and avionics that can add noise to the magnetic
measurements and thus reduce the effectiveness of the magnetometer.  One
 possible solution for noise mitigation, borrowed from helicopter
Magnetic Anomaly Detection (MAD) systems, is to tow the sensor in a
non-magnetic tow body far enough away from the aircraft so that it no
longer interferes with the sensor measurements.  Current systems have
multiple wires and transmit analog signals between the sensor and
electronics which requires a fairly large cable and additionally the
analog signals are susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI)
noise.  A fully integrated magnetometer would reduce the size and weight
 in such a tow cable by putting the control electronics in the towed
body and also reduce the power required.  Also, in remote sensor
applications, this separation requires larger sensor packages to be
developed which creates additional complications when deploying the
systems.    Low SWaP and cost expendable magnetometers are desired for
the High Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare (HAASW) mission, geomagnetic
noise reduction, in-water detection, and land-based target detection
such as buried weapons caches and improvised explosive devices (IEDs).
Proposed solutions should provide innovative design concepts for a total
 field scalar magnetometer able to operate in all Earth's field
orientations and magnitudes.  Scalar in this usage defines a
magnetometer that produces a total field magnetic measurement that is
insensitive to motion of the sensor in the Earth's magnetic field,
except for the atomic physics phenomena related to heading error.  A
vector magnetometer that only measures the magnetic field along a
sensitive axis, or combinations of multiple vector magnetometers are not
 acceptable for this effort and will not be considered for this
application.  Vector magnetometer(s) in a moving platform cannot attain
the noise level of a true scalar magnetometer due to motion induced
measurement errors.    SWaP and cost goals are driven by intended small
platform applications, which in many cases are expendable systems.  The
cost objective should be less than $5,000 in small quantities with a
goal of less than $2,000 in volume production (100 - 500 units\/year).
Proposed designs should be small.  The target volume threshold is equal
to or less than 400 cm3 with an objective of equal to or less than 100
cm3 for the complete magnetometer.  Also low-power (",

communications, sensing and surveillance systems require ever-faster
real-time acquisition and transmission of electronic signals to achieve
continuous sensing of electromagnetic spectrum. For the development and
utilization of such systems, RF photonic-based solutions that provide
ultra-wide bandwidths, low power operation, immunity to interference and

        "topic_name": "Distributed Synthetic Environment Correlation
Assessment Architecture and Metrics",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative and extensible
distributed synthetic environment correlation assessment architecture
that can verify correlation between flight simulator visual and sensor
databases.    DESCRIPTION: Naval\/Marine Corps flight simulators are
often run in isolation; however, there are growing requirements for
distributed networked simulation such as those included in the Aviation
Distributed Virtual Training Environment (ADVTE). Communication,
processing models and synthetic environments are some of the simulation
components that are affected by distributed system interoperability [1]
[2] [3].   Interoperability of distributed systems is achieved only when
 the perception of the same events and models by different systems is
similar, thus enabling the linked war fighters to work together and
achieve a common goal. Working together is dependent on the consistency
between the synthetic environments, yet today aircraft simulators rely
on manual inspection and limited testing to determine if the simulated
environments are a match between networked simulators.    Correlation
assessments between terrain databases and interoperability of simulation
 models have been investigated over the years [1] [2] [3]. However, at
this point in time no clear solution exists for the automated assessment
 of correlation errors between large synthetic environments and in
particular for the runtime formats used by the Naval\/Marine Corps
flight simulators. The current approaches bypass or minimize correlation
 assessments between synthetic environments and include techniques such
as the generation of runtime from the same source data in real time [4]
and dedicated facilities which generate static representations of the
different environments based on a fix set of simulators [3]. The former
real time regeneration technique requires co-located simulators and
large network bandwidth whereas the latter technique requires dedicated
terrain database generation facilities that result in large production
and integration times as well as large budget. A gap exists in the
automated assessments of correlation errors between large synthetic
environments as far as it relates to visual and sensor simulation for
Naval\/Marine Corps flight simulators. Considerations on architecture,
data collection, runtime, read and write operations and parameter
prioritization will enable a robust and flexible solution that can be
expanded to include other tests and formats.    Correlation errors occur
 between different simulation systems when environmental representation
features are rendered differently between simulation applications [4].
Although some metrics and tools have been proposed in the past [2] [4],
an automated, and even semi-automated, process for determining the
degree of correlation between heterogeneous human in the loop simulators
 in a distributed environment still does not exist.  As a result,
programs must spend many months determining the degree of similarity
between simulators and its impact on a successful networked exercise.
This analysis may have to be repeated if new simulation platforms are
added, and if the training scenario or location changes.    Ideally, the
 distributed synthetic environment correlation assessment architecture
for aviation platforms should be flexible and expandable so that it can
perform comparisons between different formats, versions of the same
databases, and the original geospatial source data. The correlation
assessment should put particular emphasis on aircraft mission areas of
interest such as airports, landing zones, confined area landings,
low-level terrain flight areas, and ranges. The correlational assessment
 should be automated and consider environment components of designated
areas of interest that affect mission performance, such as avenues of
approach, key landmarks, feature densities and texture densities.
Furthermore, the architecture should allow for the addition of new
runtime and source formats, as well as new tests and analysis plug-in
modules by third party developers. The results of the correlation
analysis should be displayed in a graphical way that allows for easy
understanding of the correlation differences and the impacts on
distributed training.    The correlation assessment component of the
architecture should include parameters that consider visual and sensor
simulation. Different weights should be used to account for the
importance of virtual simulation domain, visual cues in different
platforms, and training missions. The prototype should determine the
degree of similarity between simulators for the simulation of sensors to
 include visual, radar, infrared, night vision devices, and others by
geospatial location regions. The prototype should accommodate the
different models which are used in simulations which include: rendering
models, animations, sensor models, mobility models, damage assessment
models, and explosions.    The prototype should consider metrics such as
 terrain elevation, culture existence, feature size and attributes,
surface materials and composition, and line of sight. Evaluation between
 two or more representations should be based on a criterion that
considers the most important parameters. Criteria for correlational
score should consider constraints such as domain, platform, and training
 mission and weigh them accordingly. Furthermore, the proposed prototype
 should consider how standards, such as the Common Image Generator
Interface (CIGI) and High Level Architecture (HLA), could be leveraged
to collect data. The prototype concept should describe how runtime
read\/write and test Application Programming Interface (API) will be
developed to allow access to proprietary runtime format data and enable
flexible testing modules that can be developed by third parties.     The
 prototype should consider source dataset formats such as NAVAIR
Portable Source Initiative (NPSI), Marine Corps ADVTE virtual
simulations aviation platforms, and constructive simulations formats,
such as Joint Semi-Automated Forces (JSAF)\/Tactical Environment (TEn)
Compact Terrain Database (CTDB) v8.    PHASE I: Investigate, further
define, propose, design and demonstrate the feasibility of an extensible
 distributed synthetic environment correlation assessment architecture
for aviation platforms that incorporates the various criteria and source
 dataset formats described above, including: a set of correlation
metrics and weighing schema, a strategy for acquiring synthetic
environment data to support the correlation metrics, and an API that
supports the proposed collection of environment data. Propose a strategy
 or plan for the determination of acceptable values for correlation and
how this correlation level maps or translate to an interoperability
assessment.    PHASE II: Develop, demonstrate and validate a prototype
system using selected flight simulation facilities and trainers. Include
 test techniques for the validation of the metrics.    PHASE III:
Transition and apply the new technologies developed into standalone

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative and efficient
low-cost means of measuring full-hemisphere, open-air, warhead fragment
mass, geometry, and velocity information during munitions explosions.
 DESCRIPTION: The present method of warhead characterization is costly,
labor intensive, and produces only a piece of the required data. A
warhead is placed in the center of an arena test bed consisting of
blast-pressure gages and fragment catch bundles. Fragment catch bundles
(composed of fiber materials, e.g. Celotex) are placed just above ground
 level and arc around the warhead at a large radius. While this large
radius ensures bundle survival during blast-pressure impingement,
bundles occupy only a small slice of the hemisphere. As such, only a
fraction of the fragments are captured for inclusion in the subsequent
warhead characterization analysis. Weeks of tedious and error-prone
labor are necessary to locate, recover, weigh, and describe the geometry
 of each fragment entering the bundles. Many small fragments are not
recovered and few if any individual fragments are mapped to their
specific velocities. In order to complete the dataset for user
consumption, analysts subject raw warhead test data to a series of
assumptions including averaging and rotations to produce an
approximation of the true warhead"s fragment mass and velocity field.
Individual fragment masses or geometries remain uncoupled from their
velocities and many of the smaller fragments are not included in the
data collection.      All warhead characterizations and data reduction
methods are conservatively-skewed to help ensure target kills. As such,
true munitions lethalities are higher than their arena test scores. The
differential presents a problem when accounting for collateral effects.
 Munitions must be selected to destroy a target and do no additional
harm.  Corrective measures, such as re-characterizing munitions are
prohibitively time consuming, expensive, and potentially technically
problematic.     An innovative combined sensor and software technology
is needed whereby sensors can assess object movement within large
hemispherical volumes (15 to 300 feet in diameter) at sufficient
resolution to detect solid-masses (0.5 gram to 100 kilogram) traveling
at high-velocities (5 to 9000 feet per second) with particles (numbering
 up to 30,000) originating near the center of the hemispherical test
space and moving within that volume. The interrogation system must be
suitable for open-air outdoor testing and sufficiently robust to handle
blast overpressures ranging from 1,000 pound-force per square inch (psi)
 near the center of the hemispherical test space to 1 psi near the
fringes. The proposed interrogation system must be insensitive to
blast-flash obscuration, capable of mapping individual fragment masses
to their respective velocities, and capable of estimating each
fragment"s geometry. If the system lies within the lethal radius of the
warhead, the system must be able to reliably operate in a high-shock
environment.  Proposed research and development (R &amp; D) solutions
are allowed complete flexibility with respect to sensor interrogation
methods and data processing\/archival methods.  The focus is on
developing a suitable and efficient interrogation system. The
measurement method should be capable of characterizing warhead
fragmentation over a full-hemisphere.    PHASE I: Develop and
demonstrate feasibility of an interrogation method to complete warhead
characterization.    PHASE II: Further develop the concept from Phase I
and perform bench level testing to prove the concept worthy of
full-scale pursuit.    PHASE III: Finalize testing and transition the
technology to the appropriate platforms.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a scalable high peak-power
laser solution consisting of either a single laser or multiple

for a high peak-power blue laser system solution to be operated in
pulsed mode with high repetition rate for detection of underwater
objects from an aircraft at an altitude of not more than 1000 ft.  It
should be rugged, compact, and light enough to be used in Naval

currently support the performance, size and weight objectives needed.
Many commercially available lasers and near term developmental lasers
meet a few of the required characteristics but none can meet every
performance criteria.  It is paramount that the blue laser solution
meets or exceeds the design objectives in order to be effective for
detection of undersea objects.  Blue laser is required due to the
ability of the blue wavelength to penetrate the ocean to significant

Prediction Tool for Multi-Static Active and Passive Anti-Submarine
Warfare (ASW) Systems",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an autonomous Anti-Submarine
Warfare (ASW) sensor performance prediction tool that utilizes measured
and predicted ocean environmental data retrieved via a network
interface.    DESCRIPTION: Air ASW sensor systems like the Multi-static
Active Coherent"MAC"(SSQ-125) sonobuoy source and ADAR (SSQ-101A\/B)
receiver to provide coherent pulses and waveform flexibility like
doppler-speed sensitive and frequency modulated (FM) clutter
suppression.  The number of operational settings for this system can be
quite large requiring thousands of permutations to optimize a single
sonobuoy search area.  It can be difficult to determine exactly which
settings provide the best optimal detection capability for any given
operational area.  To solve this problem, a Air ASW multi-static active
and passive modeling and simulation tool needs to be developed to help
operators determine the best operating performance for various ASW
sensor systems.     The tool should model drifting ocean currents and
calculate and characterize ocean environments for optimal use of naval
ASW sensors and provide the best successful operational recommendation
for naval ASW sensor use.  The tool should reiterate automatically with a
 new set of parameters while trying to optimize the probability of
detection, signal excess coverage, and detection range. The tool should
be able to run multiple calculations and predictions for many locations,
 times of year, pattern variations, including sonobuoy spacing, source
depths, receiver depths, and sonobuoy pulse definitions such as pulse
length and pulse type. The tool should use the data autonomously to
determine the optimized acoustic parameters for sonobuoy patterns in
active and passive fields.  The tool should be able to ingest in-situ
measured data from the Air community, such as forecasted sound speed
from bathymetry (BT) measurements, wind speed, drift, and ambient noise.
 These measured and predicted ocean environmental parameters should be
retrieved via an interface that would be used to populate the
performance prediction tool. Autonomous performance prediction should be
 provided by interfacing with the Naval Oceanographic Office
environmental database to obtain sound speed profile overlay, ambient
noise, shipping level, sonobuoy drift overlays, and other oceanographic
environmental data. The performance prediction results including
sonobuoy depth and spacing pattern recommendations, ping plan
strategies, and pulse settings should be stored in a database management
 system for retrieval via web access. The most optimized deployable
patterns in an area should be instantaneously provided via the database
management system. The tool should learn from itself by analyzing newly
predicted or measured data against previously modeled scenarios.  If the
 input environmental data matches a previously modeled event for a given
 location and time of year, then the system should obtain the result
from the data management system and not recalculate performance
predictions that are known. Due to constant changes in weather patterns,
 temperatures, and ocean currents, historical data should be replaced
with data that is reflective of the current or the Naval Oceanographic
Office predicted environment. As new environmentally measured or
forecasted data becomes available, the tool should automatically
optimize sensor performance measurements for various operational areas.
The tool should quickly maximize the probability of detection, signal
excess, detection range, signal excess surface area map, and number of
detection opportunities. The tool should produce recommendations for
optimized sonobuoy pattern placement, sensor depth settings, detection
range, signal excess and ping plans on an ongoing 24 hours 7 days a week
 basis. The tool should support multi-static active systems, narrowband
passive prediction and detection range modeling, and run in batch mode
and utilize parallel processing techniques.  The tool should also be
able to handle ocean currents and drifting of sonobuoy systems.    Users
 should be able to select the location (latitude\/longitude), month,
source depth, receiver depth, target\/threat type, threat depth, ping
rate, aircraft parameters, sonobuoy pattern geometery, and pulse
definitions (Triple Hyperbolic Frequency Modulation, Hyperbolic
Frequency Modulation, Continuous Wave) to use for mission planning and
derive a performance prediction estimate called probability of detection
 (PD).  Users should also be able to add environmental overlays, such as
 in-situ sound speed measurements, the Naval Oceanographic Office
predicted sound speed files, known as wavelets, should be integrated. By
 automating the acoustic modeling and simulation for Air ASW sensor
performance and using current, relevant, and future-casted environmental
 data, the resulting performance predictions should be more reflective
of the true environment and greatly increase the probability of success
when ASW assets are deployed to detect, track, and localize adversarial
threats.    PHASE I: Determine feasibility and design a concept for a
multi-static active and passive modeling and simulation tool for ASW
systems.    PHASE II: Develop, demonstrate and validate the concept that
 was designed in Phase I.    PHASE III: Complete testing and transition

Operational Effectiveness (MOE) charts which are prepared for selected

factors in the sensor performance, including environmental effects, or

AOU size, time late of last detection, target speed course and depth
parameters.    Launch Platform parameters:  Speed, Altitude, and Time
late to AOU.     Once all these factors are accounted for, the tool
should provide the ASW mission commander with Pd result so he can make

Solid Fuel Ramjet (SFRJ) technologies based on novel high performance
fuels.    DESCRIPTION: Air-breathing propulsion, in the form of Liquid
Fuel Ramjet (LFRJ) or Solid Fuel Ramjet (SFRJ) systems, is a highly
competitive solution to tactical systems requiring long range and\/or
high speeds.  While significant development has occurred, including
development of several operational systems  using traditional LFRJ
technology and ducted rocket systems, few resources have been devoted to
 SFRJ"s despite the significant potential demonstrated in the programs
that have been completed [5].  SFRJ systems have a clear advantage over
rocket-based systems due to their inherent high specific impulse values
which greatly improve the range and kinematic performance of the system.
      The use of high-speed air-breathing propulsion for tactical
applications has a long history in the U.S. dating back to the Navaho,
Bomarc, and  Talos systems of the late 1950"s and early"60"s [1].  All
variants of the Ramjet, e.g. SFRJ, Ducted Rocket, LFRJ, etc., allow
significantly higher effective specific impulse (Isp&gt;1200 seconds in
the case of LFRJ and SFRJ cycles) compared with rocket propelled systems
 and can also possess design simplicity and safety advantages.  For this
 reason, a large number of strategic and target development programs
utilizing air-breathing propulsion have been conducted over the last 40
years including the Advanced Low Volume Ramjet (ALVRJ), Advanced
Strategic Air Launched Missile (ASALM), Advanced Common Intercept
Missile Demonstrator (ACIMD), Variable Flow Ducted Rocket (VFDR) [1],
and most recently, the Navy"s GQM-163A"Coyote"Supersonic Sea-Skimming
Target (SSST) ducted rocket target drone [2].  The Navy"s Ram Air Rocket
 Engine (RARE) program conducted boron and magnesium loaded SFRJ flight
tests at Mach 2.3 in 1955 with good success [3].  A SFRJ development
program in the 1970"s, culminated in a free-jet test at NASA-Lewis
Research Center in 1980 [4]. Other Air Force programs in the 1980"s
demonstrated high combustion efficiencies and the efficacy of metal fuel
 additives such as magnesium and boron.   Additionally, modern flyout
analyses comparing a min-smoke solid propellant rocket system to a
similarly sized HC\/boron-fuelled SFRJ predicted a 5-fold increase in
range using the SFRJ technology.    The SFRJ cycle is the same as the
LFRJ cycle except that the fuel exists in solid form within the chamber
and the stoichiometry of combustion is controlled by the regression rate
 of the fuel.  The fuel is not a propellant in the solid rocket motor
sense, but a pure fuel without the addition of oxidizer particles.  A
wide range of fuels can be used from polymers such as polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA) to long-chain alkanes or cross-linked rubbers such
as Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB). Because the fuel exists in
the solid form, inclusion of solid additives (e.g., metal powders,
strengthening additives, etc.) is relatively easy and can increase
potential performance gains without sacrificing safety and handling
characteristics.      SFRJ"s offer some significant advantages
including:   Simple in design compared to a liquid-fueled rocket or
LFRJ. There is no need for pumps, external tankage, injectors, or
plumbing for fuel delivery.    Higher fuel density in the solid phase
for many pure hydrocarbons and even higher if performance additives
(such as metals) are used.    Easy inclusion of solid performance
additives (such as boron, magnesium, or beryllium) which raise the heat
of combustion, and\/or the density and therefore the density impulse
capability compared with liquid ramjets.    Solid fuel can act as an
ablative insulator, allowing higher sustained combustion chamber
temperature levels (and hence specific thrust) with less complexity.
Fuel is stored within the combustion chamber allowing for more efficient
 packaging and higher mass fractions than liquid ramjets.    Can be
stored as"wooden rounds"in the same fashion as traditional solid rocket
motors with minimal logistical concerns associated with liquid fuels.
 Have potential for favorable Insensitive Munition (IM) properties due
to the minimization of oxidizers within the solid fuel grain.    To
further advance the state-of-the art in SFRJ technology, advanced fuel
formulations with high regression rate, high specific impulse and
density impulse capability need to be developed. The fuel formulations
need to generate stable and efficient combustion with air. Methods of
increasing fuel-regression rates should not be at the expense of fuel
inertness.  Fuel formulations should contain a volumetric heating value
of&gt;825 BTU\/in3 and demonstrate a combustion efficiency&gt;90%.
Additionally, system level concepts must consider precepts outlined in
referenced Military Standards [6] &amp; [7].    PHASE I: Develop
innovative fuel formulations and verify performance gains over existing
solid rocket motor systems through system level calculations and
testing.  Demonstrate operational advantages of fuel formulations and
develop a plan to transition fuels into flight-qualified system.
PHASE II: Design and develop a prototype system capable of generating
positive thrust force under realistic operating conditions.  Perform
subscale tests to assess theoretical predictions, mechanical properties,
 and burn rates associated with selected propellant formulations.
Conduct direct connect or free-jet tests using a prototype system in
order to demonstrate the performance gains of the newly developed fuel
formulations over a varying range of operating conditions.    PHASE III:
 Integrate the selected fuel formulations and motor geometry into a
munitions system capable of being integrated into the Navy warfighter
capability.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE

rocket-ramjet applications can have a dual-use application in hybrid
rocket motors.  Commercial space flight is an emerging area that could
benefit from such formulations.",

        "topic_name": "Method for the Detection of Voids Underneath
Aluminum Matting- 2 (AM-2)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a non-invasive void detection
 method technology with the capability to detect voids underneath
aluminum airfield matting (AM-2).    DESCRIPTION: The Expeditionary
Airfield (EAF) is a shorebased, mobile air base, which permits
deployment of landing force aircraft within effective range of ground
forces.  EAFs rely heavily on fully supported Aluminum Matting - 2
(AM-2) for safe and efficient operations.  One significant concern is
the formation and presence of voids underneath the AM-2 which introduce
challenges and the potential for damaging effects to aircraft and crew.
 Filled with water or air, voids occur naturally when water flows
through soil, pushing the soil down and out from under the airfield
surface.  This factor, combined with the impact of an aircraft landing
on the AM-2 surface, can compromise the mat"s ability to support normal
airfield operations.  If the foundation of the AM-2 is not fully
supported, the mat can become damaged, potentially resulting in damage
to the aircraft, equipment, and personnel.  The current void detection
technology used in the fleet uses a vehicle that is driven across the
mat. Any mat movement as a result of the vehicle's weight is then
measured for deflection and if the deflection is significant enough, the
 mat is removed and the subgrade is reworked.  This technique can
sometimes spot a void just under the mat; however, if the void is few
feet below the mat"s surface this method can be inadequate. The
detection of voids underneath AM-2 is critical to the life of the mat,
the aircraft and the safety of the warfighter.     In order for a void
detection method of this nature to effectively detect voids underneath
AM-2, the properties and specifications of AM-2 should be considered.
These properties present a unique challenge in detecting sub-grade
voids. Radar, ultrasound, and thermal imaging have been investigated
unsuccessfully in the past. Ground penetrating radar was found to be
inefficient due to its inability to penetrate AM-2"s metallic structure.
 The AM-2 cellular structure results in a lot of deflection and"noise",
making it difficult for the inspector to read and interpret the data.
  A non-invasive, user-friendly void detection sensor is needed.  The
solution should be non-invasive to minimize airfield downtime and
non-destructive as it should not disturb the sub grade.  The void
detection sensor must identify and locate voids six inches or greater in
 diameter and down to three feet below final grade. EAFs can have
airfield runway dimensions of 96 feet wide by 4,000 feet long and
greater, justifying the need for a method that can cover large swaths of
 airfield quickly and easily; if not remotely, without increasing
operator workload.  AM-2 is used in a wide variety of operational
conditions, ranging from arctic zones, temperate zones, tropical and
subtropical zones, semi-arid and arid zones warranting the need for a
method that can be easily and effectively transported and operated in a
plethora of climatic conditions. The technology would not only aid in
ensuring the safety of the Warfighter, equipment, and aircraft, but it
would also increase ease-of-use and provide cost reduction
opportunities, as well as commercial applications.  The ability to
detect voids underneath metallic matting would also enable preventive
maintenance, allowing problems to be addressed before they escalate and
result in costly, damaging effects.    Made of 6061-T6 aluminum, AM-2 is
 cellular in structure with integral aluminum ribs.  AM-2 features 13
cells, a top skin thickness of approximately 0.14 inches and a bottom
skin thickness of approximately 0.125 inches, and AM-2 comes in two
different sizes with overall dimensions measuring two feet by six feet
by 1.5 inches and two feet by 12 feet by 1.5 inches.  In addition, AM-2
is painted green and the top skin is covered with an epoxy-based nonskid
 material; a void detection method should take into account these
properties as they could potentially affect the method"s capabilities.
  The AM-2 expanse can serve a variety of functions (e.g. airfield
runways, taxiways, parking areas, and Vertical Takeoff and Landing
(VTOL) pads), and are painted and marked differently, depending on
intended function.  Yellow paint, white paint and glass beads are just a
 few marking materials that a void detection method must be able to
penetrate.  In addition, the ideal method should also be able to
penetrate rubber\/tire buildup, Petroleum, Oils, and Lubricants (POLs),
deicing chemicals, and hydraulic fluid, as these materials can be
present on AM-2. All of these different materials must be understood by
the sensor and its data must be displayed in a clear and concise manner.
    PHASE I: Develop a conceptual design for a void detection method
that meets the requirements above.  Prove the feasibility of such a
device through analysis and\/or lab demonstrations.    PHASE II:
Finalize, build and demonstrate a prototype with the capability to
detect voids underneath AM-2. Provide estimates for production cost.
PHASE III: Build production units for transition for EAF use.  Provide
logistics, including operational and maintenance manuals.    PRIVATE
SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: In addition to
benefits provided to the DoD, the application of a method that could
detect voids underneath aluminum airfield mat would be particularly
beneficial to the construction industry and municipal public works.  A
device of this nature would provide the ability to detect soil erosion
underneath buildings, roads, or runways.  By determining the condition
of the infrastructure early on, maintenance work and preventive measures
 can be taken to ensure the integrity of the infrastructure; thereby
reducing replacement costs and failure of the infrastructure.",

Photodiode Receiver",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop and package high-power
balanced photodiodes for wideband Radio Frequency (RF) photonics
receiver applications.    DESCRIPTION: The need for compact ruggedized
microwave photonic links arises in avionic platforms as photonics
continues to provide unique solutions in a wide variety of military
applications. The requirements for high dynamic range links have
previously been demonstrated but a lack of packaged components able to
withstand harsh environments persists. Photodiodes presently limit many
multi-octave applications presenting a need for ruggedized high-power
wideband photodiode receivers. Balanced photodiodes provide a number of
advantages in high power link applications. Shot-noise limited
performance at high optical power with advantages in link gain,
spurious-free dynamic range and noise figure can be achieved through
balanced detection. To achieve high-fidelity multi-octave performance,
one proven technique uses balanced photodiodes to suppress photodiode
even-order distortions.    The multi-octave dynamic range of a photonic
link is typically quantified in terms of second-order and third-order
output intercept points, OIP2 and OIP3, respectively. Balanced
photodiodes offer the ability to suppress second-order distortion so
that the link is third-order limited by modulator nonlinearities.
High-power balanced photodiodes and packaging of these devices,
providing balanced photodetector receivers for wideband RF photonic air
platform applications is desired. Balanced photodiodes that operate at
1.3 micron and 1.55 micron require, per balanced pair, a 20 GHz
bandwidth at 100 mA (50 mA per photodiode) and 40 GHz bandwidth at 50 mA
 (25 mA photodiode).  The targeted OIP3 is 40 dBm at 20 GHz for 50 mA
per photodiode with a minimum OIP3 of 30 dBm. The minimum required
rejection for both common-mode noise and even-order distortion is 20 dB.
  An OIP2 of approximately 70 dBm is required to maintain a conventional
 Mach-Zehnder modulator link to be third-order limited for 1 MHz
instantaneous bandwidth, which requires 50 dBm OIP2 per photodiode.
Linearity specifications should be met across 20GHz bandwidth. The
output power at 1-dB compression for the total packaged balanced
photodetector receiver is required to be 14 dBm, such that the receiver
does not degrade an intrinsic Mach-Zehnder compression at 100 mA. Low
back reflection, single-mode fiber coupled surface-illuminated or
edge-illuminated photodiode designs are encouraged. The efficiency
should be high enough to keep power consumption low, with a target of
0.7 A\/W effective DC responsivity referenced to the fiber inputs. The
balanced photodiodes are required to be packaged providing balanced
photodetector receivers with fiber pigtails and standard RF connector
outputs such as 2.92 mm coaxial connectors.  The packaged devices should
 maintain the RF bandwidth and linearity specifications discussed above.
 A balanced photodetector receiver package is required that has a
package height less than or equal to 5 mm, a package volume of
approximately 2.5 cubic centimeters.  The packaged balanced
photodetector receiver must operate over a temperature range of -40 to
100 degrees Celsius, and maintain hermeticity and optical alignment upon
 exposure to air platform vibration, thermal shock, mechanical shock,
and temperature cycling environments.       PHASE I: Design and analyze a
 new approach for balanced photodiodes. Demonstrate feasibility of
balanced photodiode response with a supporting proof of principle bench
top experiment showing path to meeting Phase II goals. Design and
analyze a balanced photodetector receiver package prototype.    PHASE
II: Optimize the balanced photodiode and packaged photodetector receiver
 designs from Phase I.  Build and test the balanced photodetector
receiver to meet design specifications.  The prototype should be able to
 be tested in an RF photonic link with the minimum performance levels
reached.  Characterize the packaged balanced photodetector receiver over
 the full -40 to 100 degree Celsius ambient temperature range and air
platform thermal shock, vibration and mechanical shock spectrum.  If
necessary perform root cause analysis and remediate balanced photodiode
and balanced photodetector receiver package failures.  Deliver balanced
photodetector receiver package prototypes on evaluation boards.    PHASE
 III: Perform extensive balanced photodiode and balanced photodetector
receiver package reliability and durability testing.  Transition the
balanced photodetector receiver technology to radar systems, electronic
warfare systems, and communication systems on appropriate platforms.

        "topic_name": "Low Magnetic Signature Expendable Unmanned Aerial
 Vehicle (UAV) for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a low magnetic signature,
expendable Tier 1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that can be launched
from a P-8A or similar military aircraft via the sonobuoy launch system
from high altitude, with the capability to carry a sensitive scalar
magnetometer for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Magnetic Anomaly Detection
 (MAD) with the requirement that the inherent UAV magnetic noise shall
not limit the effectiveness of the MAD sensor.    DESCRIPTION: With the
introduction of the P-8A Poseidon into the fleet, the ASW Concepts of
Operations (CONOPS) is shifting from the low altitude search and track
as was done by the P-3C to a High Altitude ASW (HAAWS) mission where the
 P-8A remains at altitude for the ASW mission from initial detection
through the attack phase.  As such, there is a need to localize and
maintain track of the submerged submarine while the mission aircraft
prepares to drop a weapon and provide updated targeting information to
the weapon as it descends to the splash point.  Previously, the precise
localization was done by the P-3C use of an inboard MAD system which
required the aircraft to fly at 300-500 foot altitude.      ONR and
NAVAIR are developing the concept of a MAD equipped UAV that can be
launched from aircraft at high altitude which would then autonomously
localize and track the submerged submarine and continue tracking the
target after weapon release for possible re-attack. There were previous
developments of sono-launched UAVs, but neither was initially designed
to be magnetically quiet.   Preliminary magnetic profiling of these UAVs
 indicates that they will require major redesign in order for the MAD
system to be effective, assuming the re-design is even doable and
effective.      A UAV designed to be magnetically quiet from the
beginning and still be capable of sono-launch from high altitude in the
final version is desired.  Innovative research and techniques are needed
 to quiet a small UAV that will have known magnetic interference sources
 such as motors, servos and avionics and minimally use any magnetic or
conductive material in the fuselage, wings, controls, control surfaces,
structural components, etc.     There has been very little if any
development to integrate a magnetometer sensor in a UAV because of
issues of magnetometer availability and the problem of reducing the
inherent platform noise in such a small platform. The concept of a small
 MAD equipped UAV can only be realizable now with the advent of suitable
 low-cost Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) magnetometers currently in
development.  New high strength composite materials will be a benefit to
 the design of the structure, but there are many electro-magnetic
interference issues will need to be dealt with.     Additionally since
the MAD sensor is"blind"to the type of magnetic target it detects, a
basic camera will be required in the prototype to distinguish a MAD
contact as a surface or subsurface contact.  The objective would be an
EO\/IR turret system in the final system which would provide additional
capability to the warfighter.     The objectives of this development

 a separate reference sensor.  Geology noise compensation not required.)

There is a need for a low profile antenna for Multi-Band (X, Ku, and Ka
SATCOM) including potential option for Ku band Tactical Common Data Link
 (TCDL) capable of operating at bandwidths up to 14 Megabits per second
(MBS) while maintaining the same effective radiated power as standard
size antenna apertures. Standard size satellite antennas have a greater
height projection which creates greater aerodynamic drag.  An antenna
with a lower outward projection that does not sacrifice antenna gain
does not currently exist. A successful antenna could be used for"through
 the rotor"helicopter applications on Vertical Take-off Unmanned Air
Vehicle (VTUAVs) and other manned helicopters. An antenna design
incorporating antenna diversity feature for dual antenna operations
which would allow for continuous availability"without interruption"of

 target weight of a X\/Ku\/Ka SATCOM Aircraft system (antenna, radome,
modem and power amplifiers - excluding aircraft unique supporting

aperture diameter of 18 inches is the maximum allowable due to size
constraints. Radome vertical height cannot exceed 15 inches.  There is a
 need for X, Ku, and Ka modes to be reconfigurable during flight. Design
 solution must account for losses (forward and return gain) when going
through the rotors. Modem type and whether the modem design is intended
for through the rotor applications should be specified (prototype modems
 are sufficient).  It is understood that design trades may yield higher
weights if a TCDL capability was to be incorporated into this antenna
system (in addition to multi band X\/Ka\/Ku SATCOM).    PHASE I: Develop
 an initial concept design of an antenna system which is capable of dual

capability and identify any hardware architecture required to interface

turning on a rotary wing aircraft (A Bell 407 aircraft is desirable ).

have to provide a suitable test asset with their plan.     Demonstrate
Diversity tracking on 2 antennas mounted under the aircraft on a test

capabilities to separate small boats, semi-submersibles and periscope

performance, track lifetime, and track association in dense target

Feature Aided Tracking and Discrimination (FAT-D) capability could
significantly improve situational awareness of the surface picture
through surveillance of a larger region of interest, more efficient
target interrogation, extended track life, improved
classification\/identification performance, and optimization of radar
resources. FAT-D approaches are not currently utilized in standard Navy
airborne radar systems. When compared to kinematic-only trackers the
FAT-D approach should provide 100x track life improvement as quantified
by initial track identity lifetime (ITIL) and dominant track identify
lifetime (DTIL) metrics. The general approach follows a chain of
increasing confidence in target classification using traditional surface
 search modes to first detect moving vessels and to classify them based
on their estimated length information and high range resolution bulk
filtering to identify those vessels of interest. The FAT-D approach
should exploit vessel length information during a search and acquisition
 mode to identify different classes of vessels. By interleaving the high
 range resolution mode with search modes a more efficient use of radar
resources is possible along with the ability to pre-filter targets
before committing the radar to longer Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar

        "topic_name": "Environmentally Friendly Alternative Synthesis
and Process to Manufacture Cost-Effective Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane
(CL-20)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate a viable
alternate synthesis route for Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) with
 efforts directed to lowering production costs for CL-20 bulk use.
DESCRIPTION: CL-20 is the most energy-dense explosive material. CL-20
surpasses current state of the art nitramines,
cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX) and
cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX) in performance by up to 20 percent
as an explosive and has a better oxidizer to fuel ratio as a propellant
ingredient. In the correct configuration, particle size, and morphology,
 CL-20 shows similar or even improved impact, shock, and thermal
responses than RDX and HMX, but with significant performance
improvement. There is a significant increase in interest for CL-20 in a
wide variety of applications. However, CL-20"s potential as a
large-scale replacement for the widely used RDX and HMX is limited due
to its cost-prohibitive nature.  The United States"(US) primary domestic
 source of CL-20 has been using the benzylamine synthesis route to
prepare the tetra-acetyldiamino isowurtzitane (TADA) precursor. This
source was given exclusive right to the CL-20 work approximately 14
years prior with the belief that they would be able to increase
production and reduce cost, allowing this material to be utilized as a
tool for our warfighter capability. In all actuality, the reverse has
occurred with reduced production and increased cost. The source
originally purchased this precursor from a non-US source at a fairly
hefty price, which resulted in initial CL-20 costs of $550\/lb. The
non-US source stopped supplying the material. As it stands, no firm
manufacturing replacement has been identified domestically. This
continues to hamper the ability of  CL-20 to be produced at a reasonable
 cost and production rate, thus resulting in ever increasing costs which
 stand currently at $950\/lb. CL-20"s production process suffers from
several economic and environmental disadvantages resulting in a low
number of US-based suppliers.  As such, discovery of novel applications
for this material and the continued development of promising
applications have been limited.  The synthesis route needs to redefine
or tailor alternate synthesis routes, using pharmaceutical methods
and\/or other approaches, in order to improve and advance these efforts
towards a final environmentally friendly and cost effective solution.
 Novel synthetic routes to CL-20 that will significantly reduce the cost
 associated with this material are of great interest. Specifically
seeking novel synthetic routes to CL-20 that avoid starting reagent
benzylamine, (thus eliminate chlorine waste streams), and costly
transition metal catalysts (palladium and platinum).  The approach to
designing a lower-cost process begins with the use of inexpensive
commodity chemicals and no more than four synthetic steps during
processing. Proposals which incorporate widely used and inexpensive
commodity chemicals as starting materials while featuring fewer
synthetic steps will be given priority. Strong considerations will also
be given to the alternate chemistry proposing environmentally-friendly. A
 successful development should reduce the cost of CL-20 to around
$150\/lb or lower, and upon transition to industrial scale would provide
 even greater cost savings making CL-20 competitive with RDX and HMX,
the current explosive and propellant nitramines. Once, cost becomes

enormously in performance and sensitivity as an alternate to the other
nitramines.     In the development of alternate synthesis routes,
characterization of chemical structure, thermal, and physical properties

is required to validate precursor and intermediates developed and
utilized in the alternate synthesis pathway to CL-20 end product. Final
characterization and verification of the CL-20 end product is required
to validate the feasibility of the alternate synthesis route.    PHASE
I: Design and determine feasibility of a concept for an alternate
synthesis route of CL-20. Prepare a minimum of 5-grams of a novel direct
 precursor to CL-20 at laboratory scale. Characterize the key thermal
and physical properties of all intermediates and potential hazard
sensitivity.    PHASE II: Using results from Phase I, develop and
optimize laboratory process for production of minimum 100-gram scale of
new precursor to CL-20. Demonstrate the production of CL-20 from this
precursor at multi-gram scale, Verify the structure, thermal stability
and potential hazard sensitivity. Validate that the laboratory synthesis
 exhibits a lower cost than the current state-of-the-art process.
PHASE III: Complete and transition a scale-up process design and data
package that has demonstrated production and reproducibility for
lower-cost commercial production of CL-20 with direct scale-up to be
demonstrated in conjunction with Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an advanced human engineering
 based interface for multiple manned or unmanned aircraft mission
planning.    DESCRIPTION: Currently, the mission planning process is
labor and time intensive, complicated, and requires considerable
training and proficiency.  Nearly every aircraft requires a digital
mission plan to be completed prior to being able to launch.
Additionally, prior to being able to deviate from an existing plan, long
 range unmanned Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)
platforms require a completed and validated plan to be authorized to
deviate from the existing route.  This can have serious impact to the
ability of a vehicle to prosecute time critical popup targets that
require anything more than a minor change to the approved route. This is
 due in large part to the time required to generate an
approved\/validated delta plan.      New innovative human factors
workflows and visualizations as well as significantly improved data
handling algorithms are needed to bring mission planning into a near
real time process. Current planning algorithms and processes are based
on single vehicle planning from the late Vietnam War era.  Joint Task
Force integration of Naval assets require an integrated planning
environment that allows for quick assimilation of tasking and
constraints while allowing automated algorithms to complete repetitive
labor intensive processes.  Innovative workflows are needed to allow
operators to tailor specific planning processes to optimize their output
 for the time and materials required (e.g. manned-unmanned integrated
search and rescue effort vs a 50 nm deviation from an existing 12 hour
surveillance mission).     Particular focus of the development is to
create an innovative user interface to guide mission planners in a
streamlined approach through highly complex and detailed mission

 Rate (CFAR) Detectors that support rapid mode interleaving under
resource management control that allows simultaneous support for range
dependent multi-resolution processing.    DESCRIPTION: Advancements in
sensor resource management are needed that would utilize rapid mode
interleaving on dynamic irregular time scales, capable of
multi-resolution processing and data rate management.  Current fielded
radar systems offer only the most rudimentary resource management
approaches to support detection and tracking. In a coherent radar system
 the dynamics of the target plays a critical part in determining if the
target is detected against either a clutter or noise like background.
Optimal detection of targets with different dynamics requires different
Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) schemes and parameters. Optimal
performance therefore requires utilizing variant CFAR"s in a hierarchal
manner as well as making the threshold parameters of the CFARs adaptive.
 The CFAR processing must be capable of maintaining consistent
performance across multiple waveform resolutions at the pulse repetition

approach is to provide small target detection and false alarm

        "topic_name": "Improved Reliability Laser Based Ignition
System",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative laser based
ignition system to increase the reliability of igniters and excitation
systems on aircraft gas turbine engines.    DESCRIPTION: Aircraft gas
turbine engines normally operate at high altitude where conditions for
an engine relight in the event of a flameout are far from ideal. The low
 temperatures encountered at high altitudes cause a decrease in fuel
volatility, which makes it difficult to ignite the fuel charge. Ignition
 systems are usually of the spark igniter type where it is necessary to
have a very high voltage to jump a wide igniter plug spark gap, and
also, a high intensity spark. The high energy capacitor type ignition
system is generally used for gas turbine engines since it provides both a
 high voltage and an exceptionally hot spark which covers a large area.
Excellent chances of igniting the fuel\/air mixture are assured at high
altitudes.  A typical system uses aircraft electrical power per
MIL-STD-704 of 113 volts \/400 hertz to generate high voltage pulses of
27 kilovolts at 4 joules of energy level for a period of 15
sparks\/second.  The igniter plug spark gap is sealed into the
combustion chamber where running temperatures are high with fast
transients and high pressures.     Igniters are a leading cause of
removals on aircraft gas turbine engines. Top problems are cracked
ceramic insulators, buildup of combustion contaminants at the plug tip,
erosion of the plug tip, and fouling.  Cracked ceramic insulators occur
due to the combined environment effects of temperature, thermal
transients, and moisture.  Buildup of combustion contaminants at the
plug tip results in tracking that diverts and shorts out the spark
energy.  Erosion of the plug tip is a natural effect of the plasma arc
sparking process.  Fouling is due to the accumulation of unburnt fuel or
 other airborne particles.      Prevalent ignition system designs also
contain the failure modes within the exciter box. Components are
hermetically sealed in the boxes. Seal malfunction requires replacement
of the entire exciter.  There can be breakdown or short circuits in the
high tension circuitry.  Breakdown damage to high tension igniter wires
results in loss of abrasion and radio interference protection.      An
innovative laser based design solution is sought to reduce or eliminate
these failure modes in ignition systems. A successful solution will also
 have key characteristics comparable to typical ignition system designs
on metrics of, response, power consumption, Electromagnetic Interference
 (EMI), package size, weight, cost, and electrical interface. Key
environmental concerns that need to be taken into consideration are
temperature, noise, humidity and vibration extremes. The laser based
ignition system must be compatible with a current aerospace gas turbine
engine control system.    Collaboration with an aircraft gas turbine
manufacturer is strongly encouraged.     PHASE I: Determine technical
feasibility and design a concept for an innovative laser based ignition
system.    PHASE II: Develop, test using procedures defined by SAE

the response, power consumption, and EMI.    PHASE III: Finalize testing
 and transition the technology to the appropriate platforms.    PRIVATE
SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: Ignition systems of
this type are typically very similar to those used on commercial,

Littoral Combat Ship (LCS)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative collaboration
environment for Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) that provides interaction
across various software and hardware platforms.    DESCRIPTION: The Navy
 is interested in an innovative algorithm solution to improve the
collaboration abilities for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) capabilities as
 they relate to the Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) program.  LCS is working
 toward supporting a broader surface combatant force transformation
strategy, recognizing that many future threats are emerging in shallow
water regions, where the ability to operate near-shore and in rivers
will be vital for mission success. With current lower manning levels
assigned to the ASW mission, the need exists to enhance operator
efficiency with a focus on ease-of-use, intuitive situational awareness,
 and data sharing across multiple LCS users and computer platforms
through an innovative solution.      Currently, the LCS platform has a
number of displays for showing tactical data. Each display is configured
 to show a limited data set from a predefined application suite.
Operator efficiency will be enhanced if data is not limited to a single
display, application, or hardware platform.  The current process
involves moving user interfaces to other monitors. This requires an
application that supports virtual network connections with a broader
vision of various hardware types. Existing virtualization solutions are
typically limited by computer operating systems, and by only showing the
 desktop of one machine on another. The end result is a restrictive
collaboration space.  The Navy supports forms of collaboration, such as
chat.  A single collaboration paradigm would address sharing of various
data types.  A solution that meets this need would improve the
performance and capability of the LCS ASW mission.    Expanded desktop
sharing to the next generation of collaboration of pictures, videos,
screen shots, chat, video white boarding, and remote desktop sharing is
needed.  Creating an algorithm for a collaborative environment that
allows this would enable easier, less expensive integration of the
best-of-breed applications and simplify bringing in new future
capabilities.  This requires a seamless, unified system where operating
systems, display resolutions, and hardware are not inhibiting factors
[ref. 1]. With a unified set of collaboration algorithms, the user can
repeatedly use the same interfaces, including common mouse and gesture
swipes and same menu items to open, close, and transfer data objects.
Training time is reduced with the reuse of interfaces and a solution
that mimics widely-available commercial collaboration tools (Facebook,
iPads, etc.).    An algorithmic solution is needed to support a blend of
 different technologies across different acquisition life cycles,
leverage existing technologies, minimize the need for extensive
training, and support traditional communication channels while
augmenting innovative ideas [ref. 2]. A reduction in maintenance,
manning, and operation costs will be a part of any proposed resolution.
     PHASE I: The company will develop a concept for a collaborative
environment for LCS that meets the requirements described above.  The
company will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy
needs and will establish that the concept can be feasibly developed into
 a useful product for the Navy.  Feasibility will be established through
 collaborative demonstrations and Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS)
capability assessments.  The small business will provide a Phase II
development plan, which addresses technical risk reduction and provides
performance goals and key technical milestones.    PHASE II: Based on
the results of Phase I and the Phase II development plan, the small
business will develop a prototype for evaluation. The prototype will be
evaluated to determine its capability in meeting the performance goals
defined in Phase II development plan and the Navy requirements for the
collaborative environment for LCS. System performance will be
demonstrated through prototype evaluation and modeling or analytical
methods over the required range of parameters including numerous
deployment cycles with LCS ASW specific data sets and ASW pertinent user
 interfaces.  Evaluation results will be used to refine the prototype
into an initial design that will meet Navy requirements.  The company

to Navy use.    PHASE III: The company will be expected to support the

        "topic_name": "Wireless Monitoring of Hydraulic Actuators for
Reducing Total Ownership Costs (TOC)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to develop an
innovative wireless sensor system that measures data on hydraulic
actuators and creates actionable information at the node that leads to
demonstrable improvements in Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) programs.
    DESCRIPTION: The Navy has an ongoing need to reduce total ownership
costs and extend the life-cycle of components and systems by improving
the reliability and overall operational readiness of the fleet.
Virginia-class submarines have more than 100 large hydraulic actuators,
which are removed, overhauled, and reinstalled as a part of 600 Series
work. These actuator overhauls are performed on a fixed schedule,
regardless of their use or condition. Because many of the actuators that
 are sent back for overhaul require little or no maintenance, this fixed
 schedule approach is overly conservative, expensive, and introduces
risk because the components can be damaged or improperly re-installed as
 a result of excessive actuator handling.  Wireless sensor systems are a
 promising enabling technology for cost-reduction initiatives (ref 2).
However, the machine prognostic requirements of high sampling frequency
and synchronized data acquisition exceed the total amount of wireless
data that can be transmitted continuously (ref 3).  An innovative
solution is needed to produce actionable prognostic information at the
measurement location to reduce the bandwidth.     Wireless sensor
systems can provide distributed intelligence collection for performance
evaluation, prognostic maintenance efforts, and situational awareness.
Technology exists for efficient low bandwidth wireless data collection.
 Wireless solutions for applications that require high bandwidth
measurements become expensive to accommodate large energy storage, or
are overly limited due to inadequate energy storage.  Sending all the
raw measurements stresses bandwidth and decreases the life of the
wireless node.  Directly inserting diagnostic or data compression
algorithms at the node level requires high data rates and computational
effort which decreases the value of the wireless node.  New techniques
are needed at the node level to minimize power usage while converting
the raw data into maintenance instructions.      A successful technology
 development and transition will result in fewer machinery overhauls,
shorter work task times, and optimized maintenance logistics. These
workload reductions will result in cost savings through shorter depot
times, increase overall fleet availability, and reduced total
operational costs (ref 1).    PHASE I: The company will develop a
wireless system concept that produces maintenance instructions for
hydraulic actuators. The company will demonstrate the feasibility of the
 concept in meeting Navy needs and will establish that the concept can
be developed into a useful product for the Navy.  Feasibility will be
established by material testing and analytical modeling.  The company

evaluation. The prototype will be evaluated to determine its capability
to meet the performance goals defined in Phase II development plan and
Navy sensor requirements. Sensor performance will be demonstrated
through prototype evaluation and modeling, or analytical methods over
the required range of parameters, including numerous deployment cycles.
 Evaluation results will be used to refine the prototype into an initial
 design that can be used in a shipboard demonstration and will meet Navy
 requirements.  The company will develop a Phase III development plan to
 transition the technology into a system that can be acquired by the
Navy.    PHASE III: If Phase II is successful, the company will be
expected to support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use
 should a Phase III award be made. Based on the Phase II results, the

        "topic_name": "Galley-Scullery Water Conservation System
(GSWCS)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Research, develop and demonstrate an
innovative water conservation system for shipboard application in the
Galley-Scullery that significantly reduces water usage, both potable and
 wastewater.    DESCRIPTION: The Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) are
designed for coastal shallow water operations and protection against
terrorist and asymmetric threats. The requirement for coastal shore
operations prohibits them and other naval vessels from discharging
wastewater from galley, scullery and other potential water drainage
systems in accordance with Maritime Pollution (MARPOL), federal, state
and international regulations (ref 1).  Executive Order 12088 requires
forces afloat, as appropriate, to cooperate with federal, state and
local environmental protection organizations and comply with the
official substantive standards and criteria promulgated by such agencies
 (ref 3).  Consequently, all US Navy ships, including the LCS, have to
store all wastewater generated aboard ship in the Collection Holding
Transfer (CHT) tanks, which are designed to support a 12-hour holding
period.  As stated in the white paper (ref 4),"Evolution in U.S. Navy
Shipboard Sewage and Gray water Programs", the need for U.S. Navy ships
to operate for extended periods in littoral waters, and anticipated
discharge regulation changes require a need for innovative water
conservation and recycling  systems. In some areas of the United States
such as, Washington State, Alaska, and the Great Lakes region ships are
not allowed to discharge any wastewater at all. Due to the Navy"s
increase of littoral operations, costly upgrades to the CHT tanks on
some ships are being made to increase the size of the CHT holding tanks.
 Two examples include the LHA and LPD-17 amphibious class ships. The
upgrades were implemented to increase gray water holding times from a
norm of 12 hours to 36 hours. These upgrades for just two LHA-1 class
ships cost the Navy $1,014,000 to implement during an overhaul period
(ref 7). The relatively high water demand associated with supporting the
 galley, scullery and other water drainage systems can place a
significant demand on the CHT systems due to the limited tank size and
holding capacity (ref 2).  There is a critical need to reduce water
consumption through recycling, and to decrease the amount of wastewater
entering these CHT systems by leveraging innovative water conservation
and repurposing technologies, particularly for scullery and galley
operations. The GSWCS is intended to significantly reduce the logistics
burdens and high costs associated with shore side offload and disposal
of ship wastewater. In addition to water, fuel, and manpower savings
associated with offloading of waste, the technology will allow increased
 operational time for future naval vessels operating in littoral waters
without performing costly upgrades to CHT systems or offloading of
wastewater.    The current commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) water
recycling systems that could possibly be installed aboard ships utilize
filters that tend to foul easily with the induction of gray water.  This
 is why procuring a filtration type COTS solution would not work for
gray water recycling aboard naval vessels. The filtration devices would
cause added maintenance and a need to change out filters more
frequently, thus increasing operation and maintenance support costs.
 Current state-of-the-art gray water recycling technologies utilized in
some commercial applications include: Membrane Bioreactors, Advanced
Oxidation processes, Brine Concentrator and Evaporator Recovery Systems,
 and Forward Osmosis Treatment Systems. These technologies have been
proven in the commercial sector to effectively reduce water consumption
by recovering and reusing up to 95% of all wastewater.  The Naval Sea
Systems Command (NAVSEA) (ref 4) as well as the National Aeronautics and
 Space Administration (NASA) (ref 5) are both exploring Membrane
Bioreactor technology for wastewater recycling. NASA"s wastewater
exploration process combines a membrane-aerated bioreactor with a
forward osmosis treatment system. The combination effectively destroys
harmful pathogens and removes solids.  The processed liquid"s
biochemical oxygen demand is reduced rendering the water fit for reuse.
The NASA wastewater processing system is anticipated to reduce water
consumption by more than 90%.  According to NASA and the Environmental
Protection Agency, (refs 5, 6)"forward osmosis technology is an
innovative, sustainable, and affordable alternative to reverse osmosis
technology."One key advantage of the state-of-the-art technologies for
naval vessel integration is the modularity of the systems and the
ability to fit within a small footprint or confined space such as a
shipboard application.  In addition, the innovative combination of more
than one technology could solve the existing shipboard issue of waste
water holding within a limited tank size or footprint and save the Navy
millions of dollars in CHT upgrade and support costs (ref 7).      The
GSWCS is envisioned to reduce potable water consumption, weight, and the
 amount of wastewater entering the CHT tanks aboard these vessels by
reuse of water in the galley and scullery areas.  The weight reduction
will be due to fewer gallons of wastewater being held in the CHT
systems.    The GSWCS should be configured for use in the galley and
scullery, where compact, modular and\/or under-counter installation
should be employed.  The GSWCS is envisioned to use smart control system
 technology, modularity, and automated processes to perform all
functions.  The GSWCS capabilities should include self diagnostics and
prognostics for reduced system maintenance and repair.  The autonomous
system should be developed with a modular, open systems architecture
approach to permit life-cycle upgrading, flexibility for inclusion of
various commercial technologies, and adaptability to shipboard spaces
and configurations.  The system is envisioned to include
computer-controlled sensors and operating mechanisms able to function in
 all shipboard environments and withstand shipboard motions and sea
states.    PHASE I: The company will develop approaches for an automated
 water conditioning and recycling system concept for LCS that meet the
requirements described above. The company will demonstrate the
feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy needs and will establish that
 the concept can be feasibly developed into a useful product for the

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop imaging techniques for
periscope video that improves the quality of the picture during the
pre-processing and downstream presentation of the video creation
process.    DESCRIPTION: The Navy seeks advanced imaging processing
techniques for periscope video. When a periscope video is being recorded
 it leaves camera interlacing artifacts and records smudges which occur
on the periscope lens. Videos from legacy periscopes will have etched
reticle lines which are recorded.  The interlacing artifacts, smudges,
and reticle lines complicate the video picture and reduce the
performance of existing video processing capabilities.  It requires
manual labor to edit the video so that a true picture is available.
Providing an innovative technique to improve video processing will
reduce the costs of operator workload and increase the performance of
sailors.    Due to camera and scene motion in periscope videos, reticles
 and smudges are impacted differently than imagery in the scene. The
current process involves a sailor taking the video that has been
recorded and editing it manually using editing software such that the
smudges and reticle lines are removed.  Removing the interlacing lines
is even more time consuming as the sailor attempts to blend a picture
into a discernible scene that accurately depicts the true picture of
what was recorded.  This is a laborious, time consuming process.  It
only provides marginal results with many inconsistencies still remaining
 within the video scenes.      The Navy is seeking automated techniques
to improve processing of video pictures during the pre-processing stage.
  This will improve the sailor"s ability to effectively use periscope
video by increasing the quality of the video image before it reaches the
 processing stage.  The solution will include techniques that replace
current labor intensive processes associated with manual removal of
visual artifacts. It will address automatic contact detection,
classification and tracking, and video stitching. The capability will
also allow for scene motion correction through improving de-interlacing
[ref 1], reticule and smudge removal [ref 2], and possibly Bayer color
de-mosaicing [ref 3], through the innovative integration of
pre-processing steps.    PHASE I: The company will develop a concept for
 imaging techniques for periscope video that meet the requirements
described above.  The company will demonstrate the feasibility of the
concept in meeting Navy needs and will establish that the concept can be
 feasibly developed into a useful product for the Navy.  Feasibility
will be established by analytical testing and modeling.  The small
business will provide a Phase II development plan that addresses
technical risk reduction and provides performance goals and key
technical milestones.    PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and
the Phase II development plan, the small business will develop a scaled
prototype for evaluation as appropriate. The prototype will be evaluated
 to determine its capability in meeting the performance goals defined in
 Phase II development plan and the Navy requirements for the imaging
techniques for periscope video. System performance will be demonstrated
through prototype evaluation and modeling or analytical methods over the
 required range of parameters including various testing cycles.
Evaluation results will be used to refine the prototype into an initial
design that will meet Navy requirements.  The company will prepare a
Phase III development plan to transition the technology to Navy use.
PHASE III: The company will be expected to support the Navy in
transitioning the technology for Navy use.  The company will develop
imaging techniques for periscope video according to the Phase III
development plan for evaluation to determine its effectiveness in an
operationally relevant environment.  The company will support the Navy
for test and validation to certify and qualify the system for Navy use.

        "topic_name": "Innovative Velocity Sensors",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop innovative acoustic particle
velocity sensors for SONAR arrays that achieve requirements for greater
sensitivity, environmental stability, and lower costs.    DESCRIPTION:
The Navy has identified needs to improve performance of submarines to
decrease vulnerability and increase maneuverability.  Currently, the
Navy is developing technologies for building and installing large SONAR
arrays external to the hull of a submarine.  These technologies allow
for a lightweight, scalable array which provides many options for
installation and deployment.  Integral to these arrays are the acoustic
particle velocity sensors.      There are several velocity sensors
available for use: however, these sensors do not meet the improved
sensor sensitivity desired by the Navy in order to increase the
capability of submarine flank SONAR arrays.  In addition, current sensor
 technology does not meet all the sensor environmental requirements that
 come with being installed on a submarine external to the pressure hull.
  Available sensors also require a significant amount of hands on labor
to manufacture and test which drives the per channel cost up.
Improvements to the current sensor technology are needed to meet these
evolving requirements.  The Navy requires a sensor with at least 6dB
(goal of 10dB) improved sensitivity over current velocity sensor
technology over the frequency band of 0  20kHz [Ref 1]. The sensors must
 be neutrally buoyant and respond to flexural excitation on a
viscoelastic material [Ref 2].  The form factor should be similar to
current technology [Ref 3].  The sensor must also be a higher
electro-magnetic field resistance sensor and be robust so that it can
survive the operational, physical, environmental, and compatibility
challenges encountered in a shipboard submarine environment. The
manufacturing and subsequent qualification and production testing should
 minimize the amount of hands on labor in order to reduce the recurring
sensor cost.  The Navy needs an innovative sensor solution that can meet
 all the performance, form factor, and environmental requirements while
striving to reduce per channel cost. This requires innovation at the
design level to trade off all the performance and environmental
requirements against packaging of the sensor as well as to facilitate
automation during the production phase.  Attention is needed to
materials used and their integration into the design to yield a sensor
with highly repeatable performance so that the amount of post-production
 testing and verification can be reduced.    Integrated electronics
packages will be considered, but are not desired as the sensors will
mount externally to the submarine hull and maintenance and replacement
will be difficult and costly.  A more complex sensor design (i.e.,
including electronics) introduces more failure mechanisms that could
lead to increased life cycle costs which should be avoided. However,
designs which include integrated electronics packages will be considered
 if they provide increased sensitivity over current technologies in the
range of 6dB to 10dB.  This technology will include concepts such as
investigations into design principles, materials, and construction
techniques, as well as create a benchmark"trade space"of innovations
against sensor sensitivity, sensor weight and neutral buoyancy, volume,
cost, robustness against environmental concerns, and other pertinent
parameters of velocity sensors    If this technology is implemented
successfully, it will benefit the Navy by providing a lower cost sensor
solution that enables affordable array development.  Performance
improvement and cost are two key benefits the Navy will seek with this
technology. The Navy needs improved detection, giving the platform an
increased likelihood of mission success while maintaining a less
vulnerable state.  Sensor improvement will increase situational
awareness which will result in improved operations. Reduced costs will
lead to acquisition affordability and improved reliability will lead to
lower maintenance.      PHASE I: The company will develop concepts for
improved velocity sensors that meet the requirements described above.
The company will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in meeting
Navy needs and will establish that the concept can be feasibly developed
 into a useful product for the Navy.  Feasibility will be established by

sensors. System performance will be demonstrated through prototype

 (APB) Operations Learning Environment",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to develop a
learning environment for Submarine Combat Systems that facilitates
rapid, dynamic, and timely learning on modernized Advanced Processor
Build (software) Operations.    DESCRIPTION: The introduction of
Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components to Submarine Combat Systems
has increased the pace of systems and tactical software upgrades. Navy
need dictates that submarine crews require shore-based training on
combat systems operations either before or during their platform
upgrade. The current training system uses adapted tactical software and
tactical system recordings to replicate combat systems independently in a
 classroom local area network environment. While the use of actual
tactical software results in higher fidelity and efficiency in
operations, training without a full Combat Systems Trainer can result in
 limitations which include lack of full functionality, interactivity,
scenario control and integration. The trainer, which includes hardware
and software at multiple sites, is becoming less relevant to fleet
configurations because it is cumbersome, costly, and difficult to
synchronize with the Advanced Processor Build\/Technical Insertion
APB\/TI schedule.  Additionally, a current requirement calls for combat
systems to be integrated (aka federated) to train common displays, much
like Rathnam describes in Figure 1.2: Vision for an Ontology-Based
Framework to Support Automated Simulation Integration (ref 1).
Innovative technologies are required to ensure enhanced learning of
Submarine Combat Systems operations because current technologies cannot
emulate the tactical system within the necessary timeline and with
required fidelity. Promising approaches may include innovations in
technology such as High Definition, 3D, immersive technology, virtual
realities, and others. Investigate the advantages of instructional
characteristics and motivational features of PC-based games. The company
 should conceptualize innovative or creative approaches to learning
delivery, methods, and environments. The company should research
learning delivery techniques described by Nicholson, (ref 2)  including
portability and configurations for a wide range of training skill levels
 (journeyman to master), embedded\/automated instructional capability,
and trainee operation\/familiarization prior to training opportunity.
Innovative designs should be flexible to minimize the impact of changes
and additions to the overall simulation capability. Key features for the
 proposed learning environments are flexibility, scalability, and rapid
modernization consistent with the Advanced Processor Build\/Technical
Insertion APB\/TI process at multiple geographic sites.  The learning
environment would be scalable to allow for future integration of
additional submarine warfare federated tactical subsystems training
solutions.  A successful learning environment will have a clearly
defined path for Participating Managers (PARMs) to integrate their
subsystem training solutions and has sufficient portability and.    Upon
 transition of the Submarine Combat Systems Advanced Processor Build
(APB) Operations Learning Environment to the Navy, benefits to the
Fleet\/Program include: the Modernization Training Teams (MTT) will be
able to meet the fleet operator and employment training requirements of
the new capabilities provided by the APB process; responsive operations
and employment training conducted by MTT will continue to improve fleet
readiness; MTT will have improved capabilities to train the crew
simultaneously, utilizing common displays; MTT will be able to train
basic operations, employment, communications team skills utilizing a
Sonar to Combat Control interface; training will not have to be
performed onboard the modernized platform displacing other training
requirements, impacting system installation and shipboard schedules, and
 further compressing training time due to dependence on a stable and
available system; training will not have to be performed onboard,
eliminating high attendance risk as sailors are directed to perform
other duties or respond to emergencies during allocated training time;
elimination of significant risk that training on a tactical system could
 be discontinued due to a system casualty. The Submarine Combat Systems
Advanced Processor Build Operations Learning Environment will ensure the
 fleet will be able to employ and maintain tactical submarine combat
systems and maintain readiness.    PHASE I: The company will develop
concepts for Submarine Combat Systems Advanced Processor Build (APB)
Operations Learning Environment that meet the requirements described
above.  The company will demonstrate the concepts in meeting Navy needs
and will establish that the concepts can be feasibly developed into a
tactical training simulator\/stimulator that supports multiple skill
objectives and levels for the Navy.  Design confidence and feasibility
will be established by material testing and analytical modeling.  The
company will provide a Phase II development plan with performance goals
and key technical milestones, and that addresses technical risk
reduction.    PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II
 development plan, the company will develop a scaled prototype for
evaluation as appropriate. The prototype will be evaluated to determine
its capability in meeting the performance goals defined in Phase II
development plan and the Navy requirements for the Submarine Combat
Systems Advanced Processor Build (APB) Operations Learning Environment.

        "topic_name": "SONAR Visual Reconstruction Environment (SVRE)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative interactive
visual reconstruction capability for Navy sonar systems to improve Navy
ASW proficiency for both training and operational use.    DESCRIPTION:
The Navy seeks an innovative virtualization software tool to enhance
Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) proficiency through intuitive visual
animations that use actual sonar, ground truth, and environmental data
combined with sensor performance modeling to provide understanding of
complex environmental and tactical situations.    The Navy has a need to
 improve both operational proficiency and training of operators within a
 constrained operational training environment. Current sonar operator
training includes classroom training on a sonar user interface driven by
 recorded sea data and\/or sonar simulators.  These sonar user
interfaces match in function what is aboard ship.  However, current
training cannot teach advanced concepts and operation in complex
environments. Also, the effectiveness of current training has been
degraded by compressed training cycles.         New innovative
reconstruction software tools that work with the sonar user interfaces
and provide an intuitive animated visualization would allow the
instructor to reveal complex environmental effects to determine what is
displayed on the sonar user interface.  These tools would allow the
instructor to decompose the environment by selecting individual SONAR
settings, ship operations, and environmental decisions for
visualization.  The tools would need to be able to effectively
communicate complex acoustic propagation phenomena such as multi-path,
bottom bounce, reverberation, convergence zones, and mutual
interference.  Of particular interest is the potential to use technology
 related to virtual 3D simulations to help SONAR operators better
understand how to improve tactical system employment. The use of such
tools to create an active learning environment is anticipated to
increase student engagement, comprehension, and retention, as has been
explored by Bonwell and Falvo (Ref 1, 2). The unique ability of
electronic media and virtual environments to enable such active learning
 has been discussed by Barjis et al., Franzoni and Assar (Ref 3, 4).
The training tool would reside within fielded surface ship sonar
systems, such as the AN\/SQQ-89 A(V)15, The reconstruction tool could
also be used during at-sea operations to enhance situational awareness
and operational proficiency.     Key features would include: the ability
 to conduct"what if"analysis that cannot be achieved with recorded sea
data; the ability to manipulate sonar settings to maximize acoustic
sensor capabilities based on acoustic propagation and the other sonar
equation elements; the ability to manipulate the entire sensor suite to
reinforce the impact of operator action; and the ability to conduct
interactive instructional playback of operational data or training
scenarios.  The reconstruction capability will enable research into how
sailor learning and proficiency can be enhanced. It would be desirable
to focus on task-based (vice data-based) target detection and
localization displays, along with imaging system enhancements to support
 automated visual detection, tracking, classification, and ranging.
These features should provide the operator with automated information,
including threat and trend data.    The desired capability will replay
either synthetic data or real world data collected during operational
exercises.  It will illustrate sonar signal origins, resulting sonar
display features, and operational impacts. The software tool should
concentrate on methods proven to effectively train adults (andragogy).
System design should consider adaptive training models that allow the
tool to match teaching strategies to individual student learning styles
(cf. Felder &amp; Silverman) and quantify the benefit of this
optimization. Due to rapid evolution of hardware technology, the
software tool should be hardware agnostic to allow for transportability
as system architectures evolve.    The reconstruction visualization tool
 will cover the required Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSA)
objectives required of the Sonar operator and evaluator. It is
anticipated that this technology will  significantly improve teaching
efficiency and retention of perishable skills, yielding a 30%
improvement in 6 month skill retention levels and 25% reduction in
training time.     PHASE I: The company will develop a concept for an
interactive visual reconstruction capability that can be applied to the
problem above.  The company will demonstrate the feasibility of the
concept in meeting Navy needs and will establish that the concept can be

        "topic_name": "Advanced Submarine Monitoring with Improved
Diagnostics and Prognostics",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to develop an
innovative on-node functionality for wireless sensor systems that
enables high bandwidth transient capture and analysis within the
constraints of energy harvester-powered wireless sensors.
DESCRIPTION: The Navy has an ongoing need to reduce total ownership
costs and extend the life-cycle of components and systems to improve the
 reliability and overall operational readiness of the fleet.  A cost
effective method for ensuring component reliability is to augment the
fixed schedule maintenance approach with deterministic component health
and usage data to inform selective and targeted maintenance activities.
The earliest indicators of machine failure occur at high frequencies and
 through impacts and transients.  Pumps and bearings require high
frequency data acquisition and transient event capture to predict the
failure modes and capture operational events such as cavitation.  This
opportunity is enabled through Micro Electro Mechanical Sensors (MEMS),
wireless communication, and energy harvesting, which are providing cost
effective, scalable, reliable, and accurate solutions for acquiring data
 to determine health and usage status.     These types of monitoring
systems provide essential data and secondary benefits that include
information for improving component design and tailoring of maintenance
work tasks.  For most sensor applications, including those on
submarines, wireless technology is the key enabler of monitoring
applications because it reduces sensor installation cost, reduces
maintenance associated with wiring faults, and enables system
flexibility to add or remove sensors.  The capability to measure and
analyze transient events such as pump cavitation and bearing fault
impacts is a key to extend the applicability to more applications (ref
1).  A range of sensor hardware, energy harvesting, and algorithm
technology has been developed to make this a reality (ref 2, 3).
However, a technology gap exists for accurately capturing, analyzing,
and wirelessly transmitting information from transient events (ref 4).
Many prognostic and condition based maintenance capabilities would be
improved by a sensor node with the ability to capture and analyze
transient events.  An innovative solution is needed to develop this
capability in submarine environments.    Wireless sensor systems can
provide distributed intelligence collection for performance evaluation,
prognostic maintenance efforts, and situational awareness.  Technology
exists for efficient low bandwidth wireless data collection.  However,
the power requirements for constant monitoring with standard technology
preclude transient event capture and analysis.  Wireless solutions for
applications that require transient event capture become expensive to
accommodate large energy storage, or are overly limited due to
inadequate energy storage.   New techniques are needed at the node level
 to minimize power usage for high frequency transient event measurement,
 analysis, and transmission.      Responsive proposals will address the
unique challenges of implementing challenging wireless sensor solutions
in submarine environments, including limitations on acceptable battery
chemistries, dense machinery environments for wireless communications,
limited application knowledge, and high required operational
availability.   A successful technology development and transition will
result in fewer machinery overhauls, shorter work task times, and
optimized maintenance logistics. These workload reductions will result
in cost savings through shorter depot times, increase overall fleet
availability, and reduced total operational costs.    PHASE I: The
company will develop a wireless node concept that enables high bandwidth
 transient capture and analysis within the constraints of energy
harvester-powered wireless sensors.  The company will demonstrate the
feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy needs and will establish that
 the concept can be developed into a useful product for the Navy.
Feasibility will be established by material testing and analytical
modeling.   The company will prepare a development plan for Phase II,

goals and key technical milestones.    PHASE II: Based on the results of

        "topic_name": "Sense and Respond Technology Enabling Condition
Based Maintenance (CBM)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative Sense and
Respond maintenance system for the LCS platform    DESCRIPTION: The
Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) was designed to operate with a significantly
smaller crew size than would be expected from a traditional manning
concept (Ref 1).  Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) and Open Architecture
(OA) were maximized to reduce developmental timelines as part of the
acquisition strategy.  COTS proliferation, which includes significant
capabilities of advanced sensors, could be maintained more effectively
and efficiently through Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Distance
Support (DS). Effective utilization of CBM has been identified as a
class-wide requirement for LCS (Ref 2).  Two primarily COTS-based
systems that are critical to the warfighting capabilities of LCS are the
 Mission Package Computing Environment (MPCE) and the Total Ship
Computing Environment (TSCE).  Both of these systems do not have CBM
capability and successful execution of this topic would deliver the
necessary CBM capability to both LCS variants using one common solution.
 These systems also form the backbone of the shipboard Combat System
(CS) for LCS since they house the servers the CS runs on as well as
provide the network to transfer information between combat systems
elements.  Bringing CBM capability to these systems will deliver system
health data in an actionable format to shore-based Subject Matter
Experts (SMEs) to be used to predictively identify maintenance actions
and remotely provide technical support.  The current State of the Art
(SOA) for MPCE and TSCE allows for the collection of performance
indicators for a variety of computer components.  However, no system
currently exists that bridges the gap between the warfighter and the
SME.  The current SOA is not limited by policy, only by the fact that no
 system has been developed to provide this needed capability.
Successful execution of this topic would allow for the collection,
processing and transmission of those performance indicators to SMEs.  In
 specific, current troubleshooting sessions are conducted using voice,
email, and Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) chat.
While this approach in many cases provides a quick fix to the issue at
hand, it places an unnecessary burden on the Fleet sailor to deal with
the back and forth nature inherent in e-mail troubleshooting or the
burden of having to schedule and execute a chat session.  The desired
solution would in many cases eliminate the need for the sailor to send
data to shore-based SMEs and allow the SME to determine system faults
and design solutions without burdening the sailor.  In essence this
topic describes the creation of a sense and respond system that is able
to process data from the CS shipboard computing environment and provide
it to SMEs who can use that data to improve the health of the network
much like many systems in natural world perform the same functions (Ref
3).         One technology that could be useful to mitigate these
limitations is the built-in Fault Detection and Fault Isolation (FDFI)
capability employed on LCS ships in the Mission Package Computing
Environment (MPCE) and the Total Ship Computing Environment (TSCE).
Specifically, the SMARTS system installed on LCS 1 variant ships and the
 Solarwinds system installed on LCS 2 variant ships and available to
both variants through the common Mission Package Computing Environment
(MPCE) provide this type of FDFI capability.  Both of these systems were
 chosen by the respective design agents of each system and are used in
the computer networking industry.  Specifically, these two systems are
used in the commercial sector to monitor the availability and
performance of the networks, storage environments, and servers through
the use of specialized software.  Today the information contained in
SMARTS and Solarwinds is not used to improve the uptime of the computer
systems they are running on or to help in quickly troubleshooting system
 faults. Successful execution of this topic would include building a
common sense and respond system that would work on either the LCS 1 or 2
 variants using data from SMARTS and Solarwinds respectively.  SMARTS
and Solarwinds cannot be used in their current state because no system
exists to mine, analyze, reduce and communicate the critical information
 off ship to SMEs.  To successfully address this gap it is necessary for
 the small business to design and build a common sense and respond
system for both variants of LCS.        Current practices today for
combat systems computing elements are characterized by systems failing
without any warning leading to increased logistics costs, greater need
for support personnel and, most significantly, reduced readiness.  A
good example of the potential advantages of this future sense and
respond technology can be seen in the reasonably common failure of a
network hard drive.  Currently, the shipboard operator is provided no
warning of an impending drive failure and is often presented with
generic messages that the system is non-operational.  This leads to a
having to submit an Automated Work Notification (AWN) ticket to
troubleshoot the problem, conducting one or more troubleshooting
sessions, ordering a replacement part and then installing the part.
With a successfully installed sense and respond system the shore-based
SME would automatically be sent status of the hard drive, knowing in
advance that it may be getting too fragmented and in need of
defragmenting.  The SME could then send a procedure to the crew to run
the defragmentation routine or run it by him or herself remotely thereby
 restoring performance to the drive and potentially avoiding a complete
drive failure.  The only potential limitation to the future sense and
respond system is current Information Assurance (IA) requirements in the
 Navy.  These requirements place limitations on the electronic exchange
of information to minimize the likelihood that computer systems are
compromised.  These are limitations that can be overcome through good
system design and working with IA professionals early in the design
process by the small business.  The Navy intends to provide assistance
to the small business to successfully address IA requirements for this
topic.         Successful execution of this project will generate
significant cost savings to maintain and operate a variety of systems on
 LCS platforms.  These systems include the TSCE, MPCE and combat system
computing hardware.  To date, no one system or technology exists that
performs this function in a way that will maximize the Navy"s current
investment and address the Human Systems Integration (HSI) requirements
in order to enable wide spread adoption using a common architecture
across the LCS program.  The technology gap that must be closed through
Research &amp; Development (R &amp; D) is to aggregate, analyze, reduce,
 transmit, and display shipboard data from the TSCE, MPCE and combat
system computing hardware in a way that allows the shore-based SME to
make better decisions, effect repair more rapidly, and reduce the impact
 on ship"s force.      The goal is to develop a system to get CS CBM
data into the hands of SMEs in an easily actionable format.  The TSCE,
MPCE and combat systems computing hardware are already sensorized but no
 system exists that addresses the unique requirements of both variants.
 One of the first requirements of this system would be to develop a
methodology to aggregate, analyze and reduce this data.  The data would
then need to be transferred off ship to the SME.  One system that exists
 to transfer data off ship that could potentially be used for this topic
 is the Navy Information Application Product Suite (NIAPS) system.
However, the successful small business would have to consider in their
design whether or not NIAPS would provide the needed functionality and
may have to provide an alternate solution.  The final product would be a
 complete sense and respond system that works on both LCS 1 and 2
variants that takes advantage of the currently-installed technology and
allows shore-based SMEs to prevent system faults and significantly
improve the availability of Combat Systems computing resources on-board
LCS.     PHASE I: The small business will develop a concept and
feasibility study for a sense and respond system that takes advantage of
 currently available sensors and distance support technology and meets
the goals in the description above.  The small business will provide a
Phase II development plan that addresses technical risk reduction and
provides performance goals and key technical milestones.    PHASE II:
Based on the results of Phase I, the small business will generate system
 architecture diagrams that provide both a high level and detailed
system design.  Detailed designs will include all components to be used
in the proposed system and mock-ups of all user interfaces.  They will
then develop a prototype for evaluation.  The prototype will be
evaluated to determine its capability in meeting the performance goals
defined in Phase II development plan.  System performance will be
demonstrated through prototype evaluation and modeling or analytical
methods over the required range of parameters including numerous
deployment cycles.  Evaluation results will be used to refine the
prototype into an initial design that will meet Navy requirements.  The
small business will prepare a Phase III development plan to transition
the technology to Navy use.    PHASE III: The small business will be
expected to support the Navy in transitioning the technology for Navy
use.  The small business will develop a sense and respond technology
systems according to the Phase III development plan for evaluation to
determine its effectiveness in an operationally relevant environment.

certify and qualify the system for Navy use.    PRIVATE SECTOR

significant commercial application and dual use exists for this
technology.  The system designed here could be put to use in many

Utilizing Smart-grid \/ Micro-grid Technology for Naval Applications",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks innovative power
management approaches for a shipboard power grid to effectively manage
power for advanced high power loads.    DESCRIPTION: Future ships are
expected to have considerably increased power demands compared to ships
of similar size constructed today.  In addition, high energy weapons
such as lasers and high energy sensors may be installed onto existing
legacy power systems.  Currently, naval power systems provide little or
no coordinated communications beyond generator synchronization and
hard-coded load shedding functions. These functions are dispersed in
independent controllers with very little coordinated communications or
interface definition to enable the optimized deployment and use of
electric power capability, and are specific to each ship class.  An
advanced Platform Management System (PMS), Machinery Control System
(MCS), or other tool that works within the existing control system
infrastructure is needed to integrate large power sources and loads
within the existing power system architectures or as part of a future
architecture, to ensure safe and efficient operation of the power
system.  A new infrastructure and framework using Open System
Architecture (OSA) is needed to provide new applications on existing and
 future control systems and electrical power systems. (Ref. #1)  To
support directed energy loads with limited generation resources, the
power system will have to act as an Energy Magazine, incorporating power
 conversion and energy storage to meet ship and high power load
requirements.    The Navy seeks to leverage recent advances in
intelligent power and energy management technologies driven by Smart
Grid and micro grid concepts to enable power systems that are more
autonomous and reconfigurable.  The Global Smart Grid Federation defines
 a Smart Grid as,"an electricity network that can intelligently
integrate the actions of all users connected to it  generators,
consumers and those that do both  in order to efficiently deliver
sustainable, economic and secure electricity supplies."(Ref #2) Smart
grids support distributed generation, supply and demand balancing,
intermittent renewable generation, bi-directional power flows and real
time information flow.  This mimics closely what needs to occur with
Naval power systems. While Naval ships are not implementing renewable
generation, many shipboard loads exhibit a similar stochastic behavior.
  The Navy is moving towards more electric ships to meet both existing
and emerging threats in a more affordable manner.  By employing Smart
and micro grid concepts, existing Navy power management functions can be
 modernized to enable the use of distributed localized control of
generation, storage, and load assets to coordinate and optimize the use
of the ship"s electric power capacity and provide increased intelligence
 and operation to the MCS.    This topic seeks to explore innovative
electrical system hardware architectures and power management algorithms
 that will autonomously determine and actuate existing and future
electric power systems.  The software needs to address security
requirements and must be capable of responding to changing mission
priorities.  Future platforms may feature multiple high energy loads on
the same order of magnitude as the generators.  The ability to quickly
channel power from one load to another, or from distributed energy
resources such as Energy Storage Modules (ESM), in order to maintain bus
 stability and support the ships real time mission power and energy
demands is desired.  (Ref. #3) Proposed solutions must be cost effective
 and enable energy efficient operation, support system and device
prognostics, real time situational awareness, and compatibility with
open architecture standards.    PHASE I: The company will develop a
concept for an Advanced Machinery Control System Software Utilizing
Smart-grid \/ Micro-grid Technology for Naval Applications that meet the

Operation Subsequent to High Intensity Loading",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative solution to
simulate kinematic operation of a mechanical system subsequent to high
intensity loading.    DESCRIPTION: The Navy"s shock hardening program is
 a critical element of the commitment to ensuring crew safety and
mission capabilities of its war fighting vessels to extreme loadings. To
 certify complex mechanical systems meet Navy shock hardening
requirements, the current practice is to install the system in a test
vehicle, detonate an explosive charge near the vehicle, and subsequently
 demonstrate the system operates properly (ref 1). Tests of large,
complex systems can be prohibitively costly, sometimes greater than
$10M.  Systems too large to be tested on Navy standard test vehicles can
 be certified using either the Dynamic Design Analysis Method (DDAM) or
transient shock analysis.  These methods typically evaluate structural
integrity of the system; however, they infer, rather than demonstrate,
operational capabilities.    A method, which moves away from shock tests
 of mission critical systems, is required to meet both the Navy"s shock
hardening requirements and ship design for affordability goals.  There
is no proven method that allows for the certification of shock
worthiness of complex mechanical systems other than a shock test. An
innovative approach which applies kinematic modeling to simulate the
operation of complex mechanical components, such as submarine hatches,
will allow shock certification of these complex components via test
simulation.     Kinematic modeling involves simulating contact and
friction between surfaces, large deformations, and non-linear material
behavior.  Several approaches exist to treat these phenomena (ref 2).
Solution convergence when simulating contact between surfaces can be
problematic (ref 3).      The expected product is software capable of
accurately simulating kinematic operation of complex mechanical systems.
      PHASE I: The small business will develop a concept process for
successful application of kinematic simulation to complex mechanical
systems.  The small business will demonstrate feasibility of meeting
Navy needs and will establish that the process can be feasibly developed
 into a useful product for the Navy. Feasibility will be established by
accurately simulating simple contact and sliding friction problems.  The
 small business will provide a Phase II development plan with
performance goals and key technical milestones, and that addresses
technical risk reduction.    PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I

        "topic_name": "Application of Phase Noise Discrimination to
Electronic Warfare (EW)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Research and develop methods to
detect and quantify the phase noise and phase noise statistical
parameters that correlate to threat types and platforms.    DESCRIPTION:
 Phase noise is the change in the relative electrical phase of a radio
frequency (RF) signal caused by other than intended modulations. Phase
noise is generated not only by idiosyncrasies of the transmitter, but by
 the superposition of reflections from side and back lobes of the threat
 platform [Ref 1]. The statistical distribution of amplitude and phase
from these scattering centers correlates with the physical extent and
material composition of the radiating platform.  The effect is
relatively small and difficult to measure.      Newer imaging radars can
 provide target details to support non-cooperative target classification
 and identification.  The objective of this topic is to provide a like
capability, but by passive means. This would be especially useful under
conditions when the active sensors are not available such as EMCON or
when a resource limitation due to jamming or a dense environment has
been reached.  Recent advances in receiver and signal processing
technology have made it feasible to consider using phase noise in an
operational environment. The Navy needs to determine the applicability
of discrimination of phase noise from target radar and jammer intercepts
 as a means of passive non-cooperative target recognition,
classification and identification.     Current passive Electronic
Support Measures (ESM) rely on matching the modulation characteristics
of an emitter, such as the radar"s Pulse Repetition Interval (PRI),
Frequency, and Pulse width to a previously determined set of parameters.
     The major limitations of this approach are:   1) The parameter
sets, in many cases, are not complete or unique, which causes ambiguous
identifications;   2) Error free measurements are difficult to achieve
under operational conditions;   3) These parameters can be changed to
spoof the detection system.     Therefore, a need exists to add
additional independent discriminants [Ref 2, 3] so as to provide a more
robust identification process. Since phase noise is a higher order
effect, usually measured with advanced analysis receivers, an innovative
 approach that is practically implementable in an operational system
will be required. It is proposed that this development be performed with
 the aim of adding this signal processing capability to future EW
systems, particularly Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program
(SEWIP) Block 2\/3.     PHASE I: The company will determine the
applicability and feasibility of implementing phase noise target
discrimination algorithms into SEWIP Block 2\/3 EW systems. The basic
approach should include the development of phase noise models for
various types of platforms\/emitters in order to determine detectability
 and degree of correlation of the phase noise parameters and statistics
with the platform and emitter types. The small business will provide a
Phase II development plan that addresses technical risk reduction and
provide performance goals and key technical milestones.    PHASE II:
Based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II development plan, the
small business will develop an implementation of their processes in a
hardware baseboard system suitable for field\/range testing. Evaluation
results will be used to refine their product into an initial design that
 will meet Navy requirements.  The company will prepare a Phase III
development plan to transition the technology to Navy use.    PHASE III:
 The company will be expected to support the Navy in transitioning the
technology for Navy use. This will include working with SEWIP Block 2\/3
 industry teams to implement the algorithms in fielded and future
systems. The company will support the Navy for test and validation to
certify and qualify the system for Navy use.    PRIVATE SECTOR
COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: The technology developed
here may have applicability to commercial radar applications such as air
 traffic control, ground surveillance radar, weather radars, and Navy
and Coast Guard systems. Furthermore, any system, passive or active,
that can benefit from more precise and detailed analysis of detected
signals, will enhance its performance and capabilities by using this
technology.",

        "topic_name": "Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC)
Compatible Phase Shifters for Phased-Array Radars",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop Monolithic Microwave
Integrated Circuit (MMIC) compatible phase shifters for phased array
radar applications to lower system cost while maintaining radar
performance.    DESCRIPTION: Modern active electronically scanned phased
 array radars provide outstanding capability and performance, but they
are very expensive because of the need for Radio Frequency (RF) power
amplifiers at each antenna element (RF amplifiers are a primary cost
driver in modern radar). The Navy is pursuing a sub-array architecture
which mitigates this restriction by splitting the power from a single,
highly efficient, solid-state power amplifier to multiple antenna
elements, thereby reducing cost.    Sub-array architecture opens
completely new possibilities in radar design trade space which will
result in flexible, scalable designs with increased efficiency and
decreased parts-count.  Savings in initial acquisition cost, maintenance
 cost, and operational cost (decreased power consumption through
scalability and efficiency) are therefore realized without compromising
radar performance.  However, sharing amplifiers among multiple antenna
elements requires a phase shifter for each. This imposes power handling
challenges and places significant insertion loss requirements on the
phase shifter.  Successful demonstration of new phase shifter
technology, consistent with the performance goals given herein, is
therefore a key step toward affordable future radar.    MMIC compatible
switches in various physical implementations have been offered as a
critical control component for use in phased array radars employing
digital phase shifters. MMIC compatible phase shifters bring the
potential of low insertion loss per bit and ultra-linear performance,
while requiring very low operating power. The Navy needs device
innovations that build on proven design principles.  The goal is to
develop reliable MMIC-compatible phase shifters exhibiting increased
power handling, low insertion loss, highly accurate insertion phase,
minimal activation power, and extremely fast switching times.  The Navy
is seeking to develop MMIC-compatible phase shifters meeting military
system reliability requirements that will support a 4-channel phase
shifter network composed of a single RF input divided into 4 independent
 phase-shifted output channels. The phase shifters will be capable of
output power levels of greater than 5W peak\/channel, greater than 2W
average\/channel, switching delay of less than 1msec, phase resolution
greater than 3 bits (4-bits would be desirable), and less than 1 dB
total insertion loss between the   input and the output of each phase
shifter channel. Innovative approaches which can significantly exceed
one or more of these goals are highly desirable.  The proposed phase
shifters should target S, C and X Band solid state radar applications.
  RF micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) based phase shifters have
been developed (ref. 1, 2, 3, 4). They are a valid approach, providing
the RF-MEMS phase shifters can show significant improvement over the
current state-of-the-art.  In a MEMS approach, reliability is a key
consideration that needs to be addressed.  Innovations in material,
process, and design are needed, which can lead to increased reliability
and performance.      This technology will provide an enabling component
 that provides completely new possibilities in radar front-end
architecture resulting in affordable, flexible, and scalable designs
with increased efficiency and decreased parts-count.  The developed
technologies will lead to  high performance radar systems at acceptable
life cycle cost.    PHASE I: The company will develop a concept for an
innovative MMIC compatible phase shifter that meets the requirements
detailed in the description section above.  The company will demonstrate
 the feasibility of their technology concept in meeting Navy needs and
will establish that the concept can be feasibly developed into a useful

provide a Phase II development plan and that addresses technical risk
reduction and provide performance goals and key technical milestones.

plan, the small business will develop a prototype MMIC compatible phase
shifter for evaluation. The prototype will be evaluated to determine its
 capability in meeting the performance goals defined in the Phase II

 shifter. The MMIC compatible phase shifter performance will be
demonstrated through prototype evaluation and modeling or analytical
methods over the required range of parameters including numerous
phase-shift cycles.  Evaluation results will be used to refine the
prototype into an initial design that will meet Navy requirements.  The
company will prepare a Phase III development plan to transition the

        "topic_name": "JTRS Compliant Waveform for LCS Unmanned Vehicle
Communications",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to develop an
innovative Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) compliant technology that
achieves LCS unmanned vehicle communication requirements.
DESCRIPTION: The Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) deploys multiple Unmanned
Vehicles in support of the interchangeable Mission Packages. The
Multiple Vehicle Communications System (MVCS) provides LCS Mission
Packages with the capability to simultaneously communicate with multiple
 Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) and surfaced Unmanned Underwater
Vehicles (UUVs) by providing common data link and network communication
services [REF 1].     The MVCS is designed as an open architecture
communications system that can be adapted to support any radio.  The
MVCS currently uses the RT-1944\/U radio for Line Of Sight (LOS)
communications with USV"s. The LCS Capability Development Document (CDD)
 has a requirement that future spirals of the external communications
equipment will be JTRS compliant. The LCS CDD also has a requirement
that the mission packages must operate in a jamming environment. The
RT-1944\/U radio does not meet these two important requirements. There
is currently not a JTRS compliant waveform that meets the MVCS data rate
 and anti- jamming requirements.     The threshold data rate requirement
 is 3.0 Mbps from each Unmanned Vehicle to the LCS seaframe and 0.2 Mbps
 from the LCS seaframe to each Unmanned Vehicle. The threshold number of
 unmanned vehicles is 3.  The threshold LOS range is 10 nm with antenna
heights of 90 feet on the LCS sea frame and 14 feet on the USV. The
operating frequency band is 2.2 GHz to 2.4 GHz.  The threshold
anti-jamming requirement is that the LCS sea frame and unmanned vehicles
 communicate in a 30 dB Jammer\/ Signal (J\/S) power density
environment, as measured at the antenna plane of reference, and with the
 jamming signal being a CW tone, swept CW tone, narrowband noise,
wideband noise, clone signal, and pulsed jamming located at any point in
 the operating bandwidth.  Various radio jamming types such as CW tone,
swept CW tone, Noise, clone signal, and pulsed can break the
communications link to the unmanned vehicle"s by causing packet loss or
preventing the receiver from being able to acquire or process any
signals. To counter these types of threats, an anti-jamming waveform and
 fast frequency hopping can be implemented. The current state of art
employs these techniques on narrower band waveforms but not on waveforms
 capable of meeting the MVCS LOS data rate requirement. An innovative
anti-jam waveform is needed to meet the MVCS requirements.    The
waveform shall comply with the JTRS Software Communications Architecture
 (SCA) Specification Version 4.0, which implements waveforms, protocols,
 encryption, communications processes, and hardware around an open
standards architecture [REF 2]. This core SCA will reduce technology
refresh insertion time and lower Total Ownership Costs while allowing
multiple packaging and channel configurations to match evolving
warfighter requirements. Once the JTRS compliant waveform is developed,
it will be tested and evaluated by the JTRS Test &amp; Evaluation
Laboratory [REF 3] and made available through the Joint Tactical
Networking Center for use on any JTRS compliant radio as an affordable
solution for others with requirements similar to LCS. A waveform
portability assessment will be performed to ensure that the delivered
waveform exhibits the maximum portability achievable with other JTRS
compliant radios [REF 4].     The Phase I and II efforts will not
require access to classified information. If need be, data of the same
level of complexity as secured data will be provided to support Phase I
and II work. The Phase III effort will likely require secure access, and
 NAVSEA will support the contractor for personnel and facility
certification for secure access.    PHASE I: The selected company will
develop a concept for a JTRS compliant waveform realized on a JTRS
compliant radio that meets the requirements described above.  The
company will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy
needs and will establish that the concept can be feasibly developed into
 a useful product for the Navy.  Feasibility will be established by
material testing and analytical modeling.  The small business will
provide a Phase II development plan that addresses technical risk
reduction and provides performance goals and key technical milestones.
  PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II development

waveform realized on a JTRS compliant radio according to the Phase II
development plan for evaluation. The prototype will be evaluated to
determine its capability in meeting the performance goals defined in
Phase II development plan and the Navy requirements for a JTRS compliant
 LOS waveform and radio. System performance will be demonstrated through
 prototype evaluation and modeling or analytical methods over the
required range of parameters including numerous deployment cycles.
Evaluation results will be used to refine the prototype into an initial
design that will meet Navy requirements.  The company will prepare a
Phase III development plan to transition the technology to Navy use.
PHASE III: The selected company will be expected to support the Navy in
transitioning the technology for Navy use.  The company will develop a
JTRS compliant waveform realized on a JTRS compliant radio according to
the Phase III development plan for evaluation to determine its
effectiveness in an operationally relevant environment.  The company
will support the Navy for test and validation to certify and qualify the
 system for Navy use.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE
APPLICATIONS: The private sector has a need for highly reliable wireless
 networks. Anti-jamming technology for wide bandwidth wireless networks
has applications in police, civil defense, search and rescue, and
industrial use wherever critical communications can be intentionally or
inadvertently interfered with.  One of the biggest risks in using
wireless networks in the commercial arena is that everybody shares the
same spectrum.  The state of Georgia estimates that the Port of Savannah
 adds approximately $400,000 of economic value for every hour it
operates. The threat of interference with wireless networks shutting
down the port, whether intentional or unintentional, poses a very costly
 risk to critical national infrastructure. In applications such as this,
 the additional cost incurred by adding an anti-jam waveform can be
easily justified. JTRS requires the waveform be implemented in software
so that it can operate on any JTRS compliant software defined radio.
Therefore, the waveform could be widely used in both military and
commercial applications.",

the sensor data may often be incomplete, non-contiguous, intermittent,
or degraded (see reference 1).  The uncertainties and clutter in this
environment make it challenging to present an accurate surface tactical
picture to warships at sea.  Effective track correlation, track-to-track
 association, and resolution of track ambiguity require that the system
managing these functions adapt to the characteristics of the environment
 and the kinematics of the objects of interest.    The AEGIS Weapon
System (AWS) was originally developed with an anti-air warfare (AAW)
focus and not adaptable to differing requirements for other warfare
areas such as Surface Warfare.  The Navy uses the AWS, which is the core
 of the AEGIS Combat System, to facilitate operations in warfare mission
 areas.  The Command and Decision element within the AWS manages track
correlation, track-to-track association, and maintenance of the system
track file for the entire combat system..  Due to the existing
uncertainties of the littoral regions significant track association and
correlation anomalies, and\/or track ambiguities which are inherent with
 multiple closely spaced contacts occur (see reference 2).  These
limitations caused by the challenges unique to the littoral regions
create a need for improving situational awareness. The Navy is seeking
to improve situational awareness in the littoral regions with a surface
composite tracker capability that will be integrated into the AWS.
Commercially available systems are hardware boxes designed for
contact-to-composite track association, track-to-track correlation, and
resolution of track-to-track ambiguity (see reference 3).  The Navy has
an existing commercial off the shelf hardware and computing plan
infrastructure in place and does not desire additional hardware based
solutions that would require integrated logistics support and plans for
technology refresh.  This causes the Navy to have to plan upgrades to
the hardware, establish and update logistics support, and provide a
timeline for integration beyond the current infrastructure plan.  These
make the hardware trackers unviable for Navy use due to the integration
impact on current and planned Navy baselines.  It also increases the
cost of acquisition and maintenance continually over time.      The Navy
 seeks a surface tracker software component for implementation within
the current AEGIS hardware infrastructure. The innovative software
component will be capable of subscribing to any sensor as a service on
the AEGIS local area network.  The delivered component will be capable
of subscribing to a wide variety of kinematic sensor input forms and
will include raw contact data (statistically independent) as well as
reports of track state (correlated in time).  The surface tracker can
expect data in the form of contact and track data from surface radars,
electro-optical and non-organic sensor sources that are subject to
environmental uncertainties, and provide clutter masking effects
inherent with the sea surface. The surface tracker component will
publish a multiple source contact-to-composite track developed for
maritime vehicular applications.  The tracker techniques to produce and
publish a composite tracker will estimate covariance data from knowledge
 of sensor characteristics, track kinematics, and provide prediction
data when sensor data is absent or disrupted (see reference 4).  It will
 be componentized and compliant with the US Navy"s Product Line
Architecture to facilitate integration within the Track Management
Domain. Development of robust tracking techniques will facilitate
integration of future sensor technologies.      PHASE I: The company
will develop a concept for surface track management algorithms that meet
 the requirements described above.  The company will demonstrate the
feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy needs and will establish that
 the concept can be feasibly developed into a useful product for the
Navy.  Feasibility will be established by testing and analytical
modeling.  The small business will provide a Phase II development plan
that addresses technical risk reduction and provides performance goals
and key technical milestones.    PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase
 I and the Phase II development plan, the small business will develop a
prototype for evaluation. The prototype will be evaluated to determine
its capability in meeting the performance goals defined in Phase II
development plan and the Navy requirements for the surface track
management algorithms. System performance will be demonstrated through
prototype evaluation and modeling or analytical methods over the
required range of parameters including numerous deployment cycles.
Evaluation results will be used to refine the prototype into an initial
design that will meet Navy requirements.  The company will prepare a
Phase III development plan to transition the technology to Navy use.
PHASE III: The company will be expected to support the Navy in
transitioning the technology for Navy use.  The company will develop
surface track management algorithms according to the Phase III
development plan for evaluation to determine its effectiveness in an
operationally relevant environment.  The company will support the Navy
for test and validation to certify and qualify the system for Navy use.

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an automated information
extraction and scoring system for Electronic Warfare (EW) systems to
provide disambiguated and intelligent sustainment solutions
DESCRIPTION: Systems exist today that track ship-board inventories of
spare equipment and other sustainment related needs.  The use of these
tracking systems requires that a user manually research and combine the
information to make an objective conclusion on how to best maintain
Electronic Warfare (EW) systems for optimal operational readiness.
Obtaining a true picture of the ship"s operational status and risk
factors is hampered by inaccurate or out-of-date information in the
inventory systems and by a partial or limited view of the
inter-dependencies upon systems, components, and parts. This fact is
supported by the Government Accounting Office report GAO-03-887 (Ref 1),
 which shows the Navy recognizes that it has not met its supply goals
for over 20 years.    There also exists a breadth of textual resources
which remain apart from the tracking systems in use. These resources
include such documents as Department of Defense (DoD) policy and
instructions, Concept of Operations documents which address new
equipment or new methods for using existing equipment, intelligence
briefings on novel threats, systems engineering plans, system
sustainment strategies and plans, revolutions in training, and technical
 manuals for onboard equipment.  This textual information is essential
to an accurate understanding of overall system design requirements,
development and sustainment efforts, and their impact on the readiness
and suitability of EW systems (such as identifying tools and parts
inventory shortages that put the system"s readiness at risk, decreasing
operating and support costs, and providing accurate data-driven
corrective actions).  Because this valuable information is only
available in a non-machine readable format as textual documents, the
Navy has no cost effective and timely method for determining whether the
 proper support solution is available to reduce repair time and maintain
 its equipment in an optimal operational readiness state.      The Navy
needs an automated method that identifies a physical support solution
and scores the impact that solution has on the system or part
replacement events, diagnoses recorded by maintenance personnel, impacts
 to overall spare equipment inventory, and training effectiveness
throughout the design, development, and sustainment activities.  The
innovation sought is a software system to (a) automate linking the
system and sustainment dependencies identified in  acquisition
documentation to the physical support solution (for parts, tools,
equipment, and others ) and (b) score the efforts (for example
development, procurement, actual utilization rates, inventory impact
estimates, and others) through unstructured text analysis.     Entity
Extraction is the ability to automatically extract meaningful
information trapped in a variety of non-structured technical documents
and information.  State-of-the-art entity extraction systems can be
customized to identify tools, parts, and equipment available in
non-machine-readable text narratives with high accuracy to extract the
text data; however, this will not meet the need to identify the implicit
 information about overall system impact from the text sources and
provide a recommended solution. The solutions offered should document
the metrics used to monitor the accuracy of text extraction and the
impact scoring analysis algorithms (see Ref 2 for examples of
performance criteria typically used). It is expected that benefits can
be gained by exploiting structured data available in current data
sources (such as configuration data, technical manuals, parts
inventories) to boost entity extraction performance and to aid in the
resolution of similar and identical equipment (Ref. 3-4).    Given that
the same physical piece of equipment will be identified in many
different ways either by its function, by the manufacturer"s part
number, by a configuration item number, or by a reference designator a
proposed solution will necessarily have to support a form of entity
disambiguation that has the capability to gather different identifiers
from the current sustainment systems and also from the extracted text,
which all refer to equivalent or identical parts, systems, and stock
items and provide a recommended support solution.  With this technology,
 the reliability and the overall operational readiness of the fleet will
 be improved while lowering operating and maintenance costs.    PHASE I:
 The company will develop a concept for an automated information
extraction and scoring system that meet the requirements described
above.  The company will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in

key technical milestones.    PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I
and the Phase II development plan, the small business will develop a
prototype automated information extraction and scoring system for
evaluation.  The prototype will be evaluated to determine its capability
 in meeting the performance goals defined in the Phase II development
plan and the Navy requirements.  System performance will be demonstrated
 through prototype evaluation and modeling or analytical methods over
the required range of parameters including numerous deployment cycles.
Evaluation results will be used to refine the prototype into an initial

Possible commercial applications of these solutions include the medical
and clinical records management environments where detailed
physicians"and clinicians"notes can be extracted to track prescriptions,

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop innovative coating to
attenuate Electromagnetic Interference\/Radio Frequency Interference
(EMI\/RFI) without compromising required optical characteristics.
DESCRIPTION: Electronic signature control (REF #1) is one self-defense
technique employed by the Navy.  If the enemy can"t pick up the ships
electronic signal, then they can"t target it.  Therefore, the Navy needs
 to be able to attenuate EMI\/RFI to control the ships electronic
signature.  The Navy also needs to be able to effectively use its own
passive sensors to detect any threats. Metallic grids that are typically
 used to attenuate EMI\/RFI diminish the ability of passive EO\/IR
sensors to detect potential threats. Sensors used for surveillance and
fire-control need to be able to pass through windows unobstructed.  For
ships with stringent radar cross section (RCS) requirements, these
EO\/IR sensors need to be mounted behind RCS-compliant windows.
Therefore, the Navy needs windows that will meet EMI\/RFI requirements,
while maintaining the ability to pass both visible and IR wavelengths
for its own sensors.     New naval shipboard electro-optical sensor
systems require large, strong, high optical quality windows that are
transparent from 0.4 to 5 m wavelengths (REF #2) and provide

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative sonar planning
tool for automating Active Sonar Interference Avoidance Planning (ASIAP)
 to optimize management of sonar parameters.    DESCRIPTION: Currently,
Navy strike groups employ multiple active sonar systems to detect threat
 submarines [Ref 1].  These sonar systems increasingly compete for the
same frequency spectrum resulting in signal interference, which
increases false alarms and the likelihood of false detection.
Current ASIAP Systems require planning for air sensors, shipboard sonar,
 and submarine sonar. Algorithms exist to plan avoidance of mutual
interference frequencies, but not for other ASIAP variables such as
interference level, ducting, slope range scale, and ping history. New
decision algorithms and processes are required to allow the warfighter
to plan sonar deployment that goes beyond current legacy separation of
frequency schemes.        Active sonar operations in littoral waters
against small, quiet submarines need a hierarchy of Mutual Interference
(MI) reduction techniques that can be evaluated automatically (or
interactively) to determine the optimum setup, spacing, and relative
orientation for combined search performance. A Graphical User Interface
(GUI) that is intuitive to the search the planner would also be helpful.
  The program office is interested in this topic because it will improve
 mission capability and performance and because it has the potential to
reduce  manning costs.       Efficient use of ASW sonar systems will
minimize deployment of expendable and fixed sensors that provide no
value to threat detection and classification. A standard user interface
design can lower Navy manning costs through reduced training time and
increased operator performance.  Training and operational efficiencies
will be provided by use of intuitive Graphical User Interface that has
common controls with other sonar system displays.  This topic can be
especially beneficial for the Undersea Warfare Decision Support System
(USW-DSS) and to the Aircraft Carrier, Tactical Support Center (CV-TSC)
programs in reducing mutual interference, which will reduce the
likelihood of false detection and false alarm rates, thus improving the
overall chances of mission success.      PHASE I: The company will
develop a concept for an active sonar planning tool that meet the
requirements described above.  The company will demonstrate the
feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy needs and will establish that

 Optimal Space Utilization",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop an affordable innovative
standardized structure that is adaptable multiple configurations, sizes,
 and shapes.    DESCRIPTION: Navy ships are built to stringent size
constraints. Ensuring essential mission systems are accommodated is the
primary objective in the design of a Navy ship. Remaining areas and
space for crew accommodations have to be optimized. Efficient use of
allotted space and compartments on Navy ships is essential. Often areas
that are not specifically attributed to a mission system are utilized by
 custom outfitting. Custom outfitting areas for many crew accommodations
 is very costly.     One example of a shipboard structure that requires
time consuming custom installations are shower stalls. The Navy
currently has to custom build each shower stall to fit each uniquely
shaped space.  This method of custom installation is very costly and
time consuming. This construction method needs to be improved and
standardized, to reduce the time it takes to build each stall.  Each
component, of the stall, must be cut, on the ship, in an environment
that can result in poor craftsmanship, wasted material, and increased
production time.  After the stall has been built, the Navy incurs
excessive maintenance costs to maintain the seals at the joints of the
components that comprise the shower.  The current design often leaks and
 corrodes making the showers expensive and time consuming for sailors to
 maintain.      The Navy is seeking innovative manufacturing processes
and materials to produce a shower stall that is affordable, modular,
corrosion resistant, and can be built with the minimal number of
standardized components that will reduce the production time and overall
 life-cycle maintenance associated with the system.  Navy market
research has been unable to find an acceptable solution to for these
structures existing.  Developing standardized structures that provide
watertight integrity, are corrosion resistant, and prove to be adaptable
 to multiple configurations, sizes, and shapes could provide future
opportunities to introduce modularity to other shipboard applications
such as; storage compartments, boatswain lockers, or damage control
lockers.     A successful approach to developing the shower stall will
leverage innovations in material selection, sealing innovation, and
advances in modular concept design. An ideal solution would maintain
watertight integrity, at all joints, without the need for caulking, and
use only components that easily fit through a standard Navy Hatch (26"x
66") to allow for quick on-site, installation.  To ensure modularity the
 design should minimize the number of standardized, lightweight
components (ref 1).  Also, all approved materials shall meet Navy
Shipboard requirements for fire, smoke, and toxicity(ref 2).
Effective development of an affordable innovative standardized structure
 that is adaptable multiple configurations, sizes, and shapes like a
shower stall compartment, would be the first step in analyzing all
non-mission essential areas for standardized optimal space utilization.
   PHASE I: To develop an affordable innovative standardized structure
that is adaptable multiple configurations, sizes, and shapes that meets
the requirements described in the topic description.  The company will
demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy needs for
development into a useful product.  Feasibility will be established by
material testing and analytical modeling as well as design\/cost
analysis for anticipated maintenance requirement.  The small business
will provide a Phase II development plan that addresses technical risk
reduction and provides performance goals and key technical milestones.
  PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II development
 plan, the small business will develop a prototype for evaluation. The
prototype will be evaluated to determine its capability in meeting the
performance goals defined in Phase II development plan and the Navy
requirements for the affordable, standardized, modular shower stall.
System performance will be demonstrated through prototype evaluation in a
 laboratory setting and supported with modeling or analytical methods
over the required range of parameters including but not limited to
numerous deployment cycles.  Evaluation results will be used to refine
the prototype into an initial design that will meet Navy requirements
with accompanying cost benefit analysis.  The company will prepare a

Ships&amp;quot;Tanks",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to develop an
innovative system that can autonomously or remotely perform the tasks of
 cleaning, inspecting and maintaining ship"s tanks.    DESCRIPTION: The
U.S. Navy spends considerable resources on the inspection and
maintenance of ships"tanks.  Currently, inspection and maintenance of
tanks must be done manually.  At this time, there are no known, existing
 systems that can meet all requirements. The Autonomous Maintenance
Robot (AMR) is software developed to inspect the B-52 wing fuel tanks
that has obstacle avoidance and route planning, but the robot does not
have all the necessary detachments or software to complete all the tank
maintenance tasks (Ref 1). The Robotic Hull Bio-mimetic Underwater
Grooming system (Hull BUG) is an underwater robot used to clean a ship"s
 hull; however, it does not have the capability to maneuver around a
confined, complex space such as a tank. It also doesn"t have the
capability to perform many of the maintenance tasks both in regards to
tools for the robot or software (Ref 2).  The robot designed for
unsupervised grit-blasting of ship hulls (Ref 3) which latches on to the
 ship hull through magnets can perform the task of de-coating, but lacks
 the capability to perform the other maintenance tasks, perform the
tasks in a tank, or enter a tank.      This system development of this
robot will require innovation that combines spatial navigation, gripping
 and stabilizing features, sensing capability, and ability to position
and operate tools.  These tanks are spaces of all shapes and sizes and
often have very limited access. They may have contained hazardous
materials such as kerosene and other fuels.  The tanks may also present a
 slipping hazard due to slick surfaces.  To allow human entry, certain
tanks must first undergo time-consuming analysis for the presence of
harmful gases.  In all respects, these tanks present a challenging
environment and serious safety concerns.    Periodically, tanks are
opened and operations such as cleaning, de-rusting, de-coating,
painting, and inspecting are performed within.  The Navy is interested
in automating these operations so as to minimize danger to personnel.
    Ship tanks are typically constructed of steel, usually HY80 in
surface ships or HY100 in submarines.  However, tanks can also be
constructed of aluminum.  They may range in size from 100 cubic feet to
8000 cubic feet, but have no standard dimensions.  Tanks may extend
horizontally or vertically as much as 40 feet, and have curved surfaces.
  Internally, tanks are likely to contain ship structural members such
as frames, bulkheads, piping, pipe hangers, cabling, ladders, and other
features.  These unusual configurations create inspection and
maintenance challenges.  A robotic system must be versatile to deal
effectively with these varied landscapes.      Access to the ship"s tank
 is typically through a hatch at the top or side of the tank, usually 18
 inches x 15 inches.  The hatch is usually in a ship passageway several
decks below the main deck.  The passageway may be as narrow as 30
inches.  Any proposed robotic maintenance equipment must be able to
easily disassemble or collapse and be reassembled in confined spaces in
order to perform the required inspection and maintenance tasks.      The
 autonomous or remotely operated system must be able to enter the tanks,
 perform some or all of the tasks currently performed manually
(cleaning, de-rusting, de-coating, painting, and inspecting), and exit
the tanks.  The system must allow for transport by personnel through the
 ship to the tank access hatch.     PHASE I: The company will develop a
concept for an autonomous or remotely operated system capable of
remediating ship"s tanks that meet the requirements described above.
The company will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in meeting

 assessing the risks involved in various system components and assessing
 the ability of the system to complete some or all of the maintenance

key technical milestones.    PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I
and the Phase II development plan, the small business will develop a

through the evaluation of the prototype in mock environments similar to
what an autonomous or remotely operated system would encounter in
various ship tanks.  The company will use the evaluation results to
refine the prototype into an initial design that will meet Navy
requirements.  The company will prepare a Phase III development plan to

on the side\/back of the rack\/cabinet and require a duct directly
connected to the ships Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
system return service to remove heat from the ships computer rooms.
 This topic seeks to develop an innovative, more efficient air cooling
solution to cool individual computer racks\/cabinets utilizing the
below-deck plenum of the Flexible Infrastructure open HVAC (REF 2,3,4)
system supply air.  The goals of the system would be to eliminate the
standard cooling fans by bringing in cool HVAC supply air directly from
below-deck plenum and allowing hot exhaust air to exit from the top of
the rack near the ships overhead plenum returns.  This system would also
 have to incorporate a means to control the cool supply air flow to
compensate for varying cooling demands; be fully contained within the
rack\/cabinet maintaining the existing rack\/cabinet footprint (size,
shape, weight); maintain current shock mount effectiveness; and
demonstrate reliability and performance greater than current standard
fully-populated CPS racks\/cabinets (REF 1).      This innovative
solution would also be a more attractive alternative to large Computer
Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units, which are self-contained units used
to treat sets of racks as an alternative to treating the entire room via
 the existing HVAC plenum system. While these units do provide energy
savings when compared to using existing HVAC plenum systems, they can be
 very expensive and not easy to reconfigure. The Improved, Flexible
Infrastructure Compatible, Open-Loop Air-Cooled Computer Rack system
should also provide improved or at least equivalent energy savings as
the CRAC units, at a much lower cost.    LHA 8 architects are exploring
the possibility of having a number of spaces outfitted with FI systems,
which consists of an open-structures track system mounted to the deck,
bulkheads and in the overhead, and an open FI HVAC System with
under-floor supply plenums and overhead returns (REF2, 3, 4). By
reducing the need for new computer rack foundations and HVAC ducting,
the FI system allows the spaces to be reconfigured as system updates and
 changes occur at a significantly reduced cost.     Using the FI
compatible (REF 2) Improved, Flexible Infrastructure Compatible,
Open-Loop Air-Cooled Computer Rack system in these newly outfitted
compartments will allow large amounts of HVAC ducting to be eliminated.
Use of the system will result in reduced acquisition cost by eliminating
 a lot of extra HVAC ducting for computer racks; reduce the need to
rebalance the HVAC system; reduce life cycle cost by reducing
reconfiguration cost; and allow late date procurement decisions.    The
Small Business will develop a system to meet the goals of the topic.
Modeling and simulation are encouraged to guide the development of
overall prototype device design as well as to demonstrate the potential
effectiveness of the proposed prototype device.     PHASE I: The company
 will develop a concept design for an Innovative Air Cooled Computer
Rack System   that meets the requirements described above.  The company
will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy needs
and will establish that the concept can be feasibly developed into a
useful product for the Navy.  Feasibility will be established by
component testing and analytical modeling.  The small business will
provide a Phase II Development Plan that addresses technical risk
reduction and provides performance goals and key technical milestones.
  PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II Development
 Plan, the small business will develop a prototype for evaluation. The
prototype will be evaluated to determine its capability in meeting the
performance goals defined in Phase II Development Plan and the Navy
requirements for the Improved, Flexible Infrastructure Compatible,
Open-Loop Air-Cooled Computer Rack. System performance will be
demonstrated through prototype evaluation and testing for the different
configurations of the rack.  Evaluation and test results will be used to
 refine the prototype into an initial design that will meet Navy
requirements.  The company will prepare a Phase III Development Plan to
transition the technology to Navy use.    PHASE III: The company will be
 expected to support the Navy in transitioning the technology for Navy
use.  The company will develop an Improved, Flexible Infrastructure
Compatible, Open-Loop Air-Cooled Computer Rack according to the Phase
III Development Plan for evaluation to determine its effectiveness in an
 operationally relevant environment.  The company will support the Navy
for test and validation to certify and qualify the system for Navy use.
   PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: The
Improved, Flexible Infrastructure Compatible, Open-Loop Air-Cooled
Computer Rack has potential for commercial application and dual use
where data and computer rooms utilize HVAC plenums for cooling. Computer
 rooms that are cooled in such a way often have high energy consumption
due to the need to cool the entire room, not just the equipment inside
them. The proposed system will greatly reduce the energy consumption
associated with cooling the equipment, since the cool air will be
treating the equipment directly, rather than the ambient air around
it.",

        "topic_name": "In-line Testing of Fuel &amp;amp; Lube Oil",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to develop an
innovative fuel and lube oil testing system that measures physical and
chemical properties of fuel and lube oil with minimal operator
interaction.    DESCRIPTION: The ability to effectively test fuel and
lube oil onboard is critical to maintaining adequate quality in order to
 promote healthy equipment life and prevent operating machinery
shutdowns. Primary concerns are particulates, water, and microbiological
 contamination: Particulate contamination can be caused by dirt, rust
flakes, catalyst fines, or other foreign matter introduced into the fuel
 or lube oil. It can be introduced from the source, or from the ship's
own storage tanks and piping. Particulates generally settle out of
solution and accumulate at the bottom of storage tanks. However,
biological contamination and storage stability problems also generate
particulates that can stay in suspension.     Some of the specific needs
 are workload reduction and automation to support reduced number and
seniority of manpower required.  Total Ownership Cost (TOC) reduction is
 sought by developing and aiding the insertion of technology to reduce
lifecycle and sustainment costs and achieve crew manning requirements.
    Currently, fuel quality in the field or onboard a ship is assessed
with a series of traditional American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) fuel test procedures using laborious techniques such as the clear
 and bright test. This test requires sampling from the fuel line,
placing the sample in a clean, clear glass and visually inspecting the
sample to determine if it is clear and bright.  Other tests require a
hydrometer, a detector or other special test equipment.  A sensor-based
device to perform these tests would not only provide significant savings
 in cost and manpower but also reduce the hazards associated with
handling large volumes of fuel samples. It would also provide faster
and, in many cases, more-consistent results (Ref 1).    Lube Oil
analysis tools include spectrographic analysis which can be used to
determine the chemical composition of the oil to indicate both its
ability to perform its function and other engine faults which could
cause contamination; particle analysis which can be used to identify
mechanical wear by detecting and analyzing metal fragments found in oil
and determining their likely source by studying their shape and size.
Monitoring lube oil condition is currently achieved in two ways: Samples
 are drawn off and checked using portable equipment and test kits or
samples are drawn off and dispatched for on-shore laboratory assessment
(Ref 2).    In-line Fuel Oil and Lube Oil sensors have the capability to
 reduce crew workload and manning, thereby decreasing total ownership
cost and increasing program affordability.  A by-product of this
technology would be increased reliability of the systems using fuel and
lube oil.     An innovative automated testing system, which requires
minimal calibration and operator oversight, is sought to reduce crew
workload. This system should measure physical and chemical properties of
 fuel and lube oil such as specific gravity, viscosity, flashpoint and
presence of particulate matter. The system shall meet all three
following requirements: Sensors should report Navy standard or
commercial standard values; sensors should not require frequent
calibration (such as  each change of oil); and sensors should not
require high amounts of additional power or modification to existing
ship structures to operate.    Currently, sensors being integrated into
LCS and other warships fulfilled some but not all of the above three
requirements, which is why an innovation is needed.    PHASE I: The
company will develop a concept for an In-line Fuel and Lube Oil Testing
System that meets the requirements described above.  The company will
demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy needs and
will establish that the concept can be feasibly developed into a useful

 in meeting the performance goals defined in the Phase II development

evaluation and modeling or analytical methods over the required range of
 parameters including numerous deployment cycles.  Evaluation results
will be used to refine the prototype into an initial design that will
meet Navy requirements.  The company will prepare a Phase III

Programming",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of rapid CNC tool-path
machining is to develop a new capability to enable shorter, more
efficient manufacturing processes for large scale, high tolerance Navy
Hardware.     DESCRIPTION: Currently the manufacturing for Large Scale
Vehicle (LSV) and Navy submarine propulsors requires casting nickel
aluminum bronze (NAB) and then machining the castings into their final
shape.  These hydro shapes have high tolerance requirements on them, in
order to ensure performance.  A large part of this manufacturing process
 is the manual programming of the tool-paths for the CNC machines (ref
1,2)    As it currently stands, CNC programming for the NAVY requires
special training and manual programming of machine paths.  This can be
the longestand most expensive part of the machining process.  It can
cause an increase in manufacturing times, result in costly hardware, as
well as delay delivery of critical components.        An innovative

        "topic_name": "System-agnostic Mission Data Recording and
Reconstruction for Surface Combatants",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to develop a system
to record data in a"data agnostic"(non-system specific or unique)
manner, eliminating the current system"data stove-piping".
DESCRIPTION: The Navy currently has specialized data recorders with the
capacity to collect qualitative data on various subsystems. This
approach provides little value for overall analysis of engineering
improvements for system development, ignoring the need for quantitative
analysis of the complete integrated system. Critical system metric
measurement is not possible without stitching multiple products
together.  Data mining on the platform for on hull assistance in
decision making or crew training is ignored and largely not possible in
this collection model.  Development of a common approach to data
recording and reconstruction is needed to provide effective data access
to the operational user and support the collection needs of the
engineering development under a single product.     Development of a
standardized collection methodology that is capable of supporting the
unique needs of all end users in a single product is needed.  The
envisioned product is a single modular system that enables total
Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) module reconstruction, data playback, and
engineering analysis tools, for shore or sea operational personnel.  The
 mission data recording and reconstruction system is envisioned to
provide these capabilities by introducing a standardized product that
will enable: operator training for mission and normal operations by
facilitating the playback of system-wide recorded data, using targeted
collection of native sensors; the ability to provide an immersive
full-scale integrated environment using system-wide recorded data that
will greatly improve readiness and training effectiveness; mission
reconstruction needed to produce products for supporting operational
guidance improvements using a complete integrated single system;
reliability, maintainability, and system availability metrics
improvements to the engineering measurement program to allow more
effective analysis of the platform, by providing reporting of logistics
data for extended deployments, tracking performance and failure data in
an automated complete system approach.    Current systems do not provide
 a cohesive product to serve the needs of end users. Quantitative data
is needed for the measurement of engineering improvements, intelligence
and Concept of Operation (CONOPs) evaluations (ref 1). Limitations of
the current model do not provide the ability to"see the ship"as it was
operated, not designed.  Many good engineering tools are integrated into
 the systems and are not utilized correctly during operations, creating
significant churn in evaluating performance of the tool.  Qualitative
data collection is needed for improvements of general operational
guidance, total system employment, and for addressing training successes
 or potential deficiency analysis. Navy decision makers are unable to
demand improvements in system performance, change operational guidance,
modify training products or provide evaluation of improvements and
readiness.  Collision reconstruction and other significant event lessons
 learned are difficult to assemble and distribute as a training product
for improvements in readiness.        Current Naval recording systems
stovepipe information, supporting a singular program purpose, and
produce a myriad of data products, making the collection and
collaboration of data very challenging.  Legacy Naval recording systems
have a large but often hidden program cost within the engineering
process, many programs spend money to develop, field, collect, support
and develop tool sets for data analysis (ref 2).  The legacy systems
also rely on the operator to collect data from multiple sources for
critical data sets resulting in potential data loss and incomplete
analysis of the situation.       Commercial companies take a different
approach to data collection, focusing on collaboration from
heterogeneous networks for data collection.  This allows formatting data
 for maximum flexibility across platform operating systems to reduce
costs and achieve the greatest collaboration of collected products.
Careful selection of software and hardware for the effort is a prime
consideration for cost control.  When possible, the selection of a
replacement technology is designed to be backward compatible, reducing
rework of existing archive products.  Open format product development
provides standards that all industry partners embrace.  This allows for
data compatibility and reduced development costs for the end-user. Tape
technology such as Linear-Tape-Open (LTO) is an example of the
commercial industry standard driven by the need for a standard
collection process.      The Navy"s shift to a data agnostic recording
approach, will net a product that maximizes the ability to consistently
analyze data on or off hull, and provide potential training products on
data recorded from a variety of different systems under a single funded
source. This commonality will not just be a new recorder but a complete
recording paradigm shift.    Use of scalable hardware and software
components is envisioned to collect data under this new approach to
control costs and offer the maximum program flexibility.  The reduction
of hardware required for legacy systems is envisioned as having a common
 approach that allows all programs to benefit from common tools and
collected data (ref 3).  The new design will allow the addition of
hardware assets, and software agents using a modular approach as mission
 directives change, vice standing up full hardware recording programs
for each shift in the program"s lifecycle.     Obstacles to overcome in
the development effort include design stage impacts, identifying the
data critical to all system stakeholders, analysis of the interfaces
associated with current systems, supporting network architecture
analysis, selection of technology solutions that will allow data
portability at the lowest cost, and establishment of a standardized
collection schema that meets but allows growth with evolving system
architecture changes.    PHASE I: The Company will develop a concept for
 a data recorder and reconstruction system that meets the requirements
stated above. The company will demonstrate the feasibility of the
concept in meeting Navy needs and will establish that the concept can be
 feasibly developed into a useful product for the Navy.  Feasibility
will be established by analytical modeling.   The Contractor will also
will provide a Phase II development plan with performance goals and key
technical milestones, and that addresses technical risk reduction.
PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II development
plan, the company will develop a prototype data recorder and
reconstruction system for evaluation.  The prototype will be evaluated
to determine its capability in meeting both technical and programmatic
objectives of the Navy.  System performance will be demonstrated through
 prototype evaluation, using simulated mission system data.  Evaluation
will also employ modeling and analytical evaluations of the prototype"s
design, with an emphasis on open interfaces for injecting data, and the
ability to transform reconstructed data to different, but compatible
data formats.  Another key factor in this evaluation will be determining
 performance impacts of the reconstruction system when applying data
transformations. The company will prepare a Phase III development plan
to transition the technology to Navy use.    PHASE III: The Company will
 be expected to support the Navy in transitioning the technology for

Classification",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop data association and
classification processing techniques for multiple sonobuoys that improve
 tracking and fusion    DESCRIPTION: Improved acoustic tracking and
measurements of target acoustic frequency signatures are needed in the
Aircraft Carrier Tactical Support Center (CV-TSC).  CV-TSC provides
acoustic contacts from passive sonobuoys. Ways to improve the detection,
 localization and classification of acoustic contacts which will aid in
successful fusion with radar, Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR),Electronic
 Warfare (EW), and other tactically integrated sensors are sought. In
order to correctly associate these contacts with data being provided by
non-acoustic sensors (RADAR, (EW), Electro-Optical [EO)\/Infrared (IR)],
 an accurate localization and uncertainty region must be computed. This
reduces the amount of false tracks, duals, and clutter passed on to the
correlation process by the acoustic tracker.  CV-TSC has the need for a
capability in acoustic tracking and measurements of the acoustic
frequency signature of targets that will provide a complete
Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) situational awareness (SA) picture. These
techniques also need to provide research and support development of
target localization and acoustic identification aids. In particular, it
addresses acoustic tracking and identification for ASW assets and
sensors    Current ASW SA is derived by tracking objects using single
frequency or harmonic frequency sets. Many of the acoustic contacts
obtained are naturally broadband in nature and have fundamental
frequencies that do not lie within the frequency spectrums used by ASW
[ref 1]. This degrades tracking them under the current ASW means and
thus limits the ASW SA picture.    The Navy seeks methods that involve
recognition and classification of arbitrary frequency sets which are
obtained from sonobuoys and provide the Navy with a complete
Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Situational Awareness picture. The method
must be capable of having the obtained frequency set give input to the
data association algorithms.  It must also provide a method of
initializing tracking of an object. The resulting spectrum signatures
will be stored for later stages of attribute data fusion and used with
other nonacoustic sensor data.    Improvements to tracking performance
are the basis for determination whether the proposed data association
and frequency signature formation are successful [ref 2]. The tracking
metrics of track swap score and track ambiguity ratio will improve
through the tracking of a frequency signature. Improved data association
 provides an enhanced bearing bias estimation that yields accurate
spatial tracking which will improve the ASW situational awareness by
detection, classification and localization of threats.     Data
association and classification processing will provide CV-TSC improved
acoustic tracking and measurements of the arbitrary acoustic frequency
signature of targets. The frequency signature is used for situational
awareness of a previously tracked target which will potentially be
reacquired for tracking. The Navy seeks high level data fusion with
other nonacoustic sensors with the ultimate goal of integrating and
combining multiple sensor systems into a complete ASW situational
awareness picture.     PHASE I: The company will develop a concept for

        "topic_name": "LCS Unmanned Vehicle Sensor Data Compression",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to develop an
innovative data compression capability for the Littoral Combat Ship
(LCS) Unmanned Vehicle"s sensor data that can send large amounts of
sensor data over the horizon using a limited bandwidth High Frequency
(HF) radio link.    DESCRIPTION: The LCS deploys multiple Unmanned
Vehicles in support of the interchangeable Mission Packages. The
Multiple Vehicle Communications System (MVCS) provides LCS Mission
Packages with the capability to simultaneously communicate with multiple
 Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) and surfaced Unmanned Underwater
Vehicles (UUVs) by providing common data link and network communication
services.  MVCS uses a High Frequency (HF) radio link for OTH
communications between the LCS seaframe and the Remote Multi-Mission
Vehicle (RMMV).      The LCS Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Mission Package
has a requirement to send high resolution sonar and camera images Over
the Horizon (OTH) from the RMMV to the LCS seaframe using the limited
bandwidth HF radio link. An image compression capability is required
which is both bandwidth efficient and error tolerant (ref 1-3). Low
signal-to-noise ratios, strong rapidly varying multi-path, and noise
interference mean that relatively high error rates can be expected.
Unique research and development will be required to achieve the required
 data compression for sonar images due to the speckle noise content. An
innovative compression technique is needed to compress the RMMV sonar
and camera data so that high resolution images can be transmitted over
the limited bandwidth, error prone, HF radio link. The image compression
 solution can be in the form of hardware, software, or both.    An
improved data compression capability for communications between LCS
seaframes and unmanned vehicles will allow for more efficient use of
valuable communications bandwidth and reduce the cost of the MVCS.  High
 resolution sonar data is required in order to perform the mine
identification mission with the RMMV. The data rate required to transmit
 the high resolution sonar data exceeds what the MVCS Over the Horizon
(OTH) datalink can support. Compressing the sonar data so that it can be
 transmitted via the MVCS OTH communications datalink will improve
performance by enabling the RMMV identification mission to be conducted
at over the horizon ranges.   It will also improve safety since the LCS
unmanned vehicles don"t have an autonomous obstacle avoidance
capability.  Increasing the resolution and frame rate of obstacle
avoidance images will improve the operator"s ability to avoid obstacles.
      The data compression requirement is 8:1 or greater lossless or
visually lossless compression for the AN\/AQS-20 sensor images and RMMV
obstacle avoidance camera images. State of the art compression
algorithms for sonar images currently provide 2:1 lossless and 4:1
visually lossless compression.      The Phase I and II efforts will not
require access to classified information. If need be, data of the same
level of complexity as secured data will be provided to support Phase I
and II work. The Phase III effort will likely require secure access, and
 NAVSEA will support the contractor for personnel and facility
certification for secure access.    PHASE I: The selected company will
develop a concept for compressing the AN\/AQS-20 sonar images and RMMV
obstacle avoidance camera images that meet the requirements described
above.  The company will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in
meeting Navy needs and will establish that the concept can be developed
into a useful product for the Navy.  Feasibility will be established by
analytical modeling and feasibility testing.  The small business will
provide a Phase II development plan that must addresses technical risk

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to develop an
innovative tool that is tailored to assess and predict performance
impacts of potential changes to a ship combat system operational
console.    DESCRIPTION: Operating with a minimally manned crew is only
possible by relying on extensive cross-training. In an environment which
 requires personnel to perform a high level of multi-tasking, any change
 that may result in additional workload or reduced crew performance must
 be carefully considered. A predictive tool for synthetic environments,
such as a virtual reality training facility, is sought in order to
evaluate prospective changes for performance impact prior to actual
shipboard implementation. There are several commonly acknowledged uses
of cognitive models in synthetic environments. These include but are not
 limited to:  testing existing doctrine, testing new doctrine, testing
possible future procurements (Ref 1.) Testing possible future
procurements is the focus of this effort. A design tool that accurately
models the impact of console on a minimally manned crew can forestall
unanticipated adverse performance impacts that are realized only after
equipment is installed, requiring the costly redesign and replacement of
 equipment to maintain performance standards.    Many human factors and
ergonomics tools and technologies have evolved over the years to support
 early analysis and design of the effects of change in a work
environment, such as a ship"s combat system console. Two specific types
of technologies are design guidance and high-fidelity rapid prototyping
of user interfaces. Design guides have the shortcoming that they do not
often provide methods for making quantitative trade-offs in system
performance as a function of design and have limited value for providing
 concrete input to system level performance prediction. Rapid
prototyping, on the other hand, supports analysis of how a specific
design will affect system-level performance but is usually slow and
costly. What is often needed is an integrating methodology that can
extrapolate from the base of human factors and ergonomics data, as
reflected in design guides and the literature, to support system level
performance predictions as a function of design alternatives. A prime
candidate for this integrating methodology is computer modeling and
simulation. (Ref 2)    Design methods and analytical tools that enable
the integration of complex, and often contesting, disciplines into
effective and efficient platforms are essential. The development of
design tools capable of rapidly analyzing and evaluating platforms with
advanced system performance characteristics is a high priority. Design
decisions should take into account the full Human Systems Interface
implications and constraints, including the significant life cycle costs
 attributed to manpower as well as performance characteristics.    The
desired tool will include a model of the operational console and permit
evaluation of potential changes to the console by modeling the impact on
 computer processing load, individual operator cognitive performance,
and the overall tactical performance of the console and operator pair
within the combat system. The computer-based tool shall be capable of
analyzing environments for their multitasking requirements, creating
multitasking synthetic environments based on the current shipboard
configuration and potential modifiers, and include the means to assess
human performance and to elicit feedback, including suggestions, from
operators on improvements to the console.    PHASE I: The company will
develop a concept for an operational console modernization tool that
meets the requirements described above.  The company will demonstrate
the feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy needs and will establish
that the concept can be feasibly developed into a useful product for the
 Navy.  Feasibility will be established by analytical modeling.  The
small business will provide a Phase II development plan which that
addresses technical risk reduction and provide performance goals and key
 technical milestones.    PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and
the Phase II development plan, the small business will develop a
prototype for evaluation. The prototype will be evaluated to determine
its capability in meeting the performance goals defined in Phase II
development plan and the Navy requirements for the Operational Console
Modernization Tool. System performance will be demonstrated through
prototype evaluation and modeling or analytical methods over the
required range of parameters including deployment cycles (if available).
  Evaluation results will be used to refine the prototype into an
initial design that will meet Navy requirements.  The company will
prepare a Phase III development plan to transition the technology to
Navy use.    PHASE III: The company will be expected to support the Navy
 in transitioning the technology for Navy use.  The company will develop
 a tool to assist in Operational Console Modernization according to the
Phase III development plan.  The company will support evaluation of the
tool to determine its effectiveness in an operationally relevant
environment.  The company will support the Navy for test and validation
to certify and qualify the system for Navy use.    PRIVATE SECTOR
COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: The negative consequences
of on-the-job multitasking are well documented.  Many different
multitasking work environments, such as air traffic control, emergency
nursing, and emergency dispatching, produce increased human performance
error, burnout, stress, high drop-out rates during training, and
post-training attrition.",

and Computer Network Systems",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an intelligent information
repository software tool for shipboard technicians that automates
complex troubleshooting of maintenance and operations of naval
electronics.    DESCRIPTION: The complexity of naval electronic systems,
 which includes radars, weapons, and integrated combat systems, is
increasing, while the experience, skill levels and numbers of on-site
technicians are decreasing. This creates a void in the knowledge and
expertise needed to maintain and operate the Navy"s electronic systems.
 The problem is exacerbated because experienced shore-based technicians
cannot easily provide assistance to a ship at sea which is likely the
most critical time when system issues will emerge.  An innovative means
to capture and leverage the knowledge of more experienced shore-based
technicians to assist shipboard technicians in the operations and
maintenance of electronic systems is needed.    Shore-based radar and
combat system operations and maintenance experts have accumulated a
wealth of relevant knowledge that resides in databases, detailed test
plans, repair procedures, etc.  Shipboard technicians are unable to
leverage this disparate knowledge.  A common repository software tool
would enable them to operate, maintain, and repair their systems
quickly, efficiently, and accurately.    An intelligent algorithm is
needed that can quickly and correctly access and manipulate data from
shore based maintenance documentation that contain the required
information for the shipboard technicians. Sailors typically use
computer programs to access repair procedures for most predictable and
routine component troubleshooting and repair [Ref 1]. These procedures
are often little more than static"if, then"statements that may not
account for problems driven by external or multiple causes, or that may
be concealed by not readily apparent symptoms.   Existing procedures do
not account for experience and skill gaps, thus preventing proper system
 maintenance, troubleshooting, and repair beyond the rote instructions
provided.  There is currently no way to dynamically troubleshoot
unplanned situations.     Currently, work is being done to improve the
usefulness of data repositories by adding heuristic reasoning algorithms
 as the means by which the data is accessed. However, this work deals
with software code and other static types of databases [Ref 2].  An area
 where intelligent repositories are being used is in the information
technology and web customer service venues.     The Navy needs robust,
adaptive, information repositories that will help the Sailor with
dynamic troubleshooting in complex electronic repair situations. Such
comprehensive repositories would be able to improve sailor performance
through self-monitoring results of their diagnostic recommendations.
 PHASE I: The company will develop a concept for an intelligent
information repository software tool that meets the requirements
described above.  The company will demonstrate the feasibility of the
concept in meeting Navy needs and will establish that the concept can be

        "topic_name": "Thin Walled Corrosion Resistant Steel (CRES) Pipe
 Inspections",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to develop an
innovative technology that inspects thin walled CRES welded joints
within Jet Propulsion Grade JP-5 fuel lines.    DESCRIPTION: Thin walled
 (Schedule 10) CRES 316L pipe (ref. 1) has been used in JP-5 fuel
systems (ref. 2). The pipe joint design uses a belled end fitting
creating an inherent crevice.  The thinness of this piping may lead to
poor weld quality at the welded joints which could cause additional
crevices within the pipe joint. Crevices create areas for corrosion to
form eventually resulting in leakage across the pipe joints.  This type
of pipe is currently in use and there is a need to create an easily
applied method to non-destructively inspect welded joints to identify
areas where repair work may be necessary to preclude possible leakage.
In many instances, there is limited access space surrounding the pipe
joint.      Pipe joint leakage failures were identified on the Aircraft
Carrier USS George H.W. Bush (CVN 77) within the first three years of
service.  The JP-5 fuel system installed on CVN 77 and planned for all
FORD Class Carriers have over 28,000 welded joints per ship.  Additional
 failures are expected to be identified.    Any material or technique
developed must be safe for use in fuel piping and applicable for pipe
sizes ranging from 2 to 12 inches. Joint types include couplings, tees
and elbows which may be made using sockets or belled end fittings.
Currently available non-destructive inspections for pipe interiors are
too expensive and cumbersome to be applied on a wide scale for
In-Service Carriers. Due to pipe lengths and configurations, current
visual test inspections have not proven reliable. Therefore, a low cost
method to non-destructively measure wall thickness and determine
internal pipe weld quality is needed to ensure safe and efficient JP-5
system operation.  Replacing all thin walled welded joints or
non-destructively testing all welded joints with currently available
testing techniques are both impractical and too expensive.      The new
thin walled CRES pipe inspection technique shall be safe to use with
fuel piping and achieve competing objectives of low cost, ease of
inspection, and accurate identification of areas of potential leakage in
 the thin walled pipe joints.  Current Radiographic Testing (RT)
approaches are expensive, cumbersome, require greater access to pipe
location than is often available, and have many environmental
restrictions and require the use of trained technicians on their use.
Ref. 3 (pages 5 through 10) identifies an American Society of Mechanical
 Engineers (ASME) Code Case discussion regarding"Use of Ultrasonic
Examination of Welds as an Alternative to Radiographic Examination ASME
B31.3, Chapter IX".  Due to the size of the components, current RT
systems require several inches of access around the pipe.  In addition,
highly restrictive access is required due to the presence of
radiological components.  Recent advances in Ultrasonic Testing (UT) and
 Automated Ultrasonic Testing (AUT) (ref. 4 and 5) have been primarily
focused on large pipes (&gt;12 inches), require specialized development
for specific materials and applications, and have similar cost and pipe
access requirements as RT.  An innovation to existing technologies or
development of new approaches is needed to address these shortfalls
while delivering equal or better test results.      PHASE I: The company
 will develop a concept for an inexpensive and easily performed
non-destructive inspection method to use on thin walled CRES pipe
joints.  The concept should demonstrate how the non-destructive method
could be performed with limited access to the pipe joint, and should
present reasonable cost estimates.  Feasibility will be established by
material testing and\/or through analytical modeling.  The small
business will provide a Phase II development plan that addresses
technical risk reduction and provide performance goals and key technical
 milestones.    PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and the Phase
II development plan, the small business will develop a prototype for
evaluation. The prototype will be evaluated to determine its capability
in meeting the performance goals defined in the Phase II development
plan and the Navy requirements for the thin walled CRES pipe joint
non-destructive method.  The non-destructive inspection device and
method performance will be demonstrated through prototype evaluation and
 testing over the required range of parameters including numerous
deployment cycles and destructive testing to verify non-destructive test
 results.  Evaluation results will be used to refine the prototype into
an initial design that will meet Navy requirements.  The company will
prepare a Phase III development plan to transition the technology for
Navy use.    PHASE III: The company will be expected to support the Navy
 in transitioning the technology for Navy use.  The company will develop
 a thin walled CRES pipe joint non-destructive inspection device and\/or

 Leak Repair",

  Pipe joint leakage failures were identified on the Aircraft Carrier,

leakage repair for the intended pipe system must be able to tolerate
contact with JP-5 fuel without contaminating the fuel, and must be able
to withstand internal pressures up to 190 psi.  Current state of the art
 pipe patches intended for damage control purposes are expensive and may
 not work well on thin walled piping or with JP-5 fuel.  Repair
techniques currently available use epoxy resins which require extensive
surface preparation and curing time.  In addition, due to the confined
spaces on the ship, fumes from the application of epoxy resins can be
hazardous and therefore require environmental protection.  There is no
evidence that epoxy resin pipe joint repairs being used by the Navy will
 last as long as the rest of the piping system or if the resin will
tolerate contact with JP-5 fuel.  Any repair approach should be expected
 to last as long as the base piping installation (~25 years).
Currently, there is no available patch or industrial technique to meet
this need.    The new CRES Pipe Leak Repair shall stop existing leaks,
prevent future leaks, and achieve competing objectives of low
installation and maintenance costs, and easy application.  Any repair
concept must stop an existing leak onboard an In-Service Carrier while
it is underway.  Ideally, any proposed repair method should not require
hot work or evacuating the system.      Epoxy resin patches and welding
options are already available to repair defective pipe joints.  A
variety of damage control for fuel lines related leak repairs exist.
However, the damage control related repairs are expensive and generally
do not provide a permanent repair (ref. 3).  Composite materials could
be used for this pipe repair application (ref.4).  The bulk of research
into this area is directed at large pipe repair for the petroleum or
construction industry where metal sleeves are an option (ref. 5).
Although this type of sleeve may not be an option for this application,
the related research may be helpful.  Another potential area to
investigate is metal deposition which can be applied similarly to
welding (ref. 6) or applied with high pressure gas (ref. 7 and 8).
PHASE I: The company will develop a concept for an inexpensive and
easily applied thin walled CRES pipe leak repair that can stop an
existing leak, withstand pipe pressure up to 190 psi and tolerate
contact with JP-5 fuel.  The concept should demonstrate how the leak
repair could be applied with limited access to the pipe joint on an
In-Service Aircraft Carrier while underway.  The concept should also
present reasonable cost estimates for the technique to stop an existing
leak and prevent future leakage.  Feasibility will be established by
material testing and\/or analytical analysis\/modeling.  The small

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop an innovative compact,
high speed signal processing method to support data fusion for torpedo
defense applications that achieves the requirements of compact size,
high speed processing for signal detection and assessment, power and
affordability.    DESCRIPTION: Defensive systems for submerged and
surface platforms rely on a variety of sensor systems. Planned and
emerging missions for the Navy will increase the demand for the number
of sensors and improved situational awareness. Data fusion and advanced
signal processing of data from these sensor systems will play a key role
 supporting these new missions. The ability to process data at rates
equivalent to what unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) perform at for video
and other imagery will represent a dramatic increase in performance
improvement for the torpedo defense systems.    Increased signal
processing capacity is an urgent and constant need.  Applying
technological advances developed for UAVs or telecommunications to Navy
platform defensive systems enables affordable performance improvement.
The ability to process data in the form of radar captured video or
images presents major system design challenges for developers of
military platforms. However, new commercial products are easing these
challenges with a variety of solutions that address the particular needs
 of moving image-based data at high speed and processing it for the
demanding real-time needs of UAV applications (ref 1). The challenge is
in leveraging or building from these technologies and applying them to
the undersea environment with its unique challenges.     Mission
capability will be increased through rapid integration of new and more
complex sensors, and in some cases, sharing of data from these sensor
systems for the first time. The deployment of multiple sensors for
signal detection improves system survivability, results in improved
detection performance and may provide increased coverage in terms of
surveillance region and number of targets. The acquisition program is
supportive of this topic because it specifically addresses commonality
in signal processing among multiple systems while improving performance
and capability through data fusion. Life-cycle costs will be reduced
when a signal processing architecture is implemented that allows for
simple upgrades in software algorithm implementations and leaves
headroom for additional sensors to be added to current systems. In the
past, a new, platform specific, signal processing system would have to
be developed and introduced to support changes in data throughput. Data
fusion would not be possible.    A suitable technology requires
innovative conceptualization and design since a straightforward
engineering solution is not obvious. Proposed solutions should promote a
 total systems approach for torpedo defense systems: this would include
computationally efficient signal processing and data fusion algorithms,
processor design, and integration into the proposed platforms. Solutions
 may be comprised of technologies or concepts developed for other
military applications (such as unmanned aerial vehicles and Field
Programmable Gate Arrays [FPGAs) (ref 2), mobile communication (ref 3),
and other commercial applications that have yet to be included in
torpedo defense systems.  A successful effort will support current and
near-term processing requirements and allow for data fusion among a set
of unique sensor systems that vary from platform to platform. The
solution should also support upgrades in sensor systems with significant
 growth in data throughput from acoustic data up to video imaging
requirements. Proposals will be accepted for countermeasure and platform
 defensive applications. Systems commonality for platform defensive
applications is encouraged.     PHASE I: The company will develop
concepts for innovative, compact, high speed signal processing for
torpedo defense applications. The feasibility of the concept in meeting
Navy needs should include a tradeoff study and performance comparisons
with legacy systems developed into a useful product for the Navy.  The
performance data of the legacy systems will be measured during
laboratory testing conducted by NUWCDIVNPT.   Feasibility will be

technical risk reduction and provides performance goals and key

 and benchmarking trade studies to create a compact, high speed signal
processor. The prototype will be evaluated to determine its capability
in meeting the performance goals defined in Phase II development plan
and the Navy requirements for the compact high speed signal processor
system. System performance will be demonstrated through prototype

technology for Navy use by successfully supporting processing
requirements which allow for significant growth in data throughput for
test and validation to certify and qualify the system for Navy use.

High-Powered Phased Array Radar Systems",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative, predictive
condition-based radar maintenance forecaster for high-powered radar
systems to reduce maintenance costs and increase operational
availability.    DESCRIPTION: An innovative predictive algorithm for
forecasting the performance and maintenance of naval radar systems is
required to address issues with the present method of maintenance.
Currently, preventative maintenance for high-powered phased-array
multi-function naval radars is primarily time-based and dependent upon
human monitoring of subject systems.  Computer-controlled test and
monitor systems provide system status and allow for monitoring of key
sub-system parameters such as voltage, power, capacitance, etc., but
this data is not captured and thus not analyzed over time.  Preventative
 maintenance is not driven by automated system status or performance
indicators and trends. Thus, maintenance is performed inefficiently and
often fails to predict or prevent component and system failures.
Corrective radar system maintenance usually occurs after a component or
system fails, or if component degradation is observed during routine
preventative maintenance.  Failure to anticipate corrective maintenance
requirements increases mean time to repair (MTTR), and decreases
operational availability (Ao).  Unanticipated corrective maintenance
actions also drive up costs due to increased labor costs and expedited
shipping costs when parts have to be obtained quickly.     Expert
systems have been developed over the past 40 years that are used in a
number of fields where diagnoses or predictions are possible and useful.
  As a subset of the computer application known as artificial
intelligence, an expert system is capable of making decisions and can be
 trained to improve its performance [Ref 1].    An expert system that
can use readily available, but not currently recorded, radar system
performance parameters to predict and thus preempt component and system
failures is sought to improve overall system Ao, reduce MTTR, and reduce
 system maintenance and repair costs [Ref 2].    An example of a desired
 solution is an innovative expert system that continuously monitors the
radar"s component parametric data streams and then conducts trend
analysis. The expert system would combine the trend analysis data with
component degradation and failure data reports to improve its prediction
 algorithms.  The desired result is a system that is capable of
providing a report such as,"switch tube"A"has a 90% probability of
failure within the next 72-96 operating hours"or"the output of
component"B"decreased by 10% in the last 7 days with the rate of output
decrease accelerating significantly in the last 24 operating hours,
indicating there is an 89% probability of component failure in the next
96 operating hours."The Navy seeks an innovative condition-based
maintenance technology (i.e., a predictive condition-based radar
maintenance forecaster) that can use adaptive learning techniques
to"understand"component interdependencies and can accurately predict
component failure of radar transmitters based on all available
parametric data.  The specific parts of interest include, but are not
limited to, all vacuum and traveling wave tubes (TWT), high voltage
power supplies, inverters, sidewall capacitors, faint rectifiers, and
cross-field amplifiers.  The technology will correlate to the component
parametric data and potentially the modes of operation of the radar,
power output, phase waveforms, waveform demands, waveguide VSWR,
voltages, and will adaptively"learn"to associate different conditions to
 different failure rates. [Ref 3]     PHASE I: The company will develop a
 concept for a predictive condition-based radar maintenance forecaster
that meets the requirements described above.  The company will
demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy needs and
will establish that the concept can be feasibly developed into a useful

        "topic_name": "Automated Function Point Analysis",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative function point
analysis software tool for program managers that achieves requirements
for estimating software costs.    DESCRIPTION: The Navy uses estimates
of software size such as Source Lines of Code (SLOC)) to determine
software development efforts and their associated combat system
development costs. There are significant variations in methods used for
estimating SLOC, which introduce risk. Current SLOC estimates are a
prediction of end-product code size that varies with code language (such
 as Java, C++) and software design approach.  Estimates of new,
modified, and reused SLOC to implement a capability are based upon a
Subject Matter Expert"s (SME) judgment which makes the resulting
estimate highly subjective (Ref 1).     Program Managers are required to
 prevent program cost overruns.  They rely upon accurate cost estimates
and software development metrics to ensure programs are executable and
not at risk of cost overruns.  The use of SLOC creates high risk cost
estimates due to the potential for significant variation in methods for
estimating end-product source lines of code.     The International
Function Point User Group (IFPUG) has developed a Function Point based
methodology to estimate software costs that is more accurate than the
SLOC methodology. The Navy"s transition to the Function Point based
methodology has been hindered because existing historical cost data is
based upon SLOC. Significant manual effort is needed to transition from
the current Navy SLOC practice to the current industry Function Point
methodology.  The Object Management Group (OMG) recently adopted an
Automated Function Point (AFP) Specification.  The standard defines how
to count function points that can be used to ensure software counting
consistency and will provide the standard required to enable transition
from SLOC to Function Point based software estimation methodologies (Ref
 2, 3).  However, innovation is required to adapt the standard for Navy
use.  Techniques will be needed to provide information required to
support software size estimation.  The Navy has already adopted a number
 of OMG standards such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), Data
Distribution Service (DDS) publish\/subscribe, and the System Modeling
Language (SysML). The Navy has determined that using the OMG AFP
Specification will provide better estimates related directly to
capability requirements that are available prior to software design.
 The Navy needs a tool to identify existing function points within its
collection of software. After identifying the function points,
innovative approaches are required for the development of algorithms
that can use the function points to efficiently sort through the source
code and generate accurate function point estimates that comply with
industry standards. Techniques will be required for determining which
files have associated functionality, association of functionality to
desired software capability, and presentation of the data to support
size estimation. The resulting technology should assist with identifying
 key areas of focus and provide understandable rationale for reported
function point estimates.     Once function points have been calculated,
 the user should be able to identify changes in capability requirements
to enable calculation of changes in function points and associated
software size.  The tool should determine how requirements will be used
to support analysis of software impacts related to implementing the new
capability. This innovation will ensure accurate estimates of end
product software size and thus reduce escalated cost estimates.    PHASE
 I: The company will develop a concept for an innovative function point
analysis software tool that meet the requirements described above.  The
company will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy
needs and will establish that the concept can be feasibly developed into
 a useful product for the Navy.  Feasibility will be established by
analytical modeling.  The small business will provide a Phase II
development plan that addresses technical risk reduction and provides
performance goals and key technical milestones.    PHASE II: Based on
the results of Phase I and the Phase II development plan, the small
business will develop a prototype tool for evaluation. The prototype
will be evaluated to determine its capability in meeting the performance
 goals defined in Phase II development plan and the Navy requirements
for an innovative function point analysis software tool. System

tool is based upon an OMG standard, the tool has private sector
commercial applicability. Numerous industries (e.g. banking, security,

development effort. Function point estimates are currently calculated
manually, but an OMG standard based tool provides for added efficiency
and estimating consistency.",

        "topic_name": "Waterproof Towed Array Hosewall",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to develop a towed
array hosewall that prevents water molecules from migrating through and
saturating the Isopar inside the array.    DESCRIPTION: Fat Line Towed
Arrays (ref 1,2) are experiencing hydrophone failures due to interaction
 with water molecules and require extensive repairs after limited use.
The Navy seeks an innovative hosewall material, coating, or additives
that preserve all of the existing hosewall properties, while also
preventing water permeation.  The ideal solution is one that completely
prevents water permeation for more than two years in the underwater
environment. The objective is to slow down permeation by a factor of
five (5).      The existing hose material is a polyether-based
thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) manufactured by the Lubrizol
Corporation, designated at 58300 Estane. The extrudable material was
tailored for towed array applications; with abrasion resistance and
ultraviolet resistance built-in. Water molecules from the ocean
environment are able to permeate through the hosewall in the Navy"s
towed array application.  Under typical pressure and temperature
profiles, water molecules can migrate through the 1\/4 inch hosewall in 2
 to 3 months. These molecules eventually saturate the Isopar fill fluid
used in the array, and attack critical array internal components.
The challenge is to preserve all of the hose properties (tan delta,
density, flexure resistance, Isopar compatibility, abrasion resistance)
that required a substantial test program to qualify, while providing
this new capability.  The end result will be a hosewall that does not
impact the existing beneficial properties of the hose; acoustic
self-noise, specific gravity, hoop strength, tensile modulus and
manufacturability by extrusion. An ideal solution is an additive that is
 sufficiently small to minimize hose property changes while making the
array waterproof. This improvement will greatly reduce repair costs and
improve the operational availability of Fat Line towed arrays by
allowing the arrays to remain within specification and fielded.    PHASE
 I: The company will develop concepts that demonstrate substantial
improvement in the reduction of water permeation in the towed array
hosewall either by innovative material, coatings, or additives.  The
concepts will also make a detailed comparison to all mechanical hose
properties of the Lubrizol 58300 Estane baseline material, to aid in
quantifying the risk of using this new hose as a substitute for the
baseline. The company will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in
 meeting Navy needs and will establish that the concept can be feasibly
developed into a useful product for the Navy.  Feasibility will be
established by material testing and analytical modeling.  The small
business will provide a Phase II development plan that addresses
technical risk reduction and provides performance goals and key
technical milestones.    PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and
the Phase II development plan, the small business will develop a
prototype for evaluation. The prototype will be evaluated to determine
its capability in meeting the performance goals defined in Phase II
development plan and the Navy requirements for the Fat Line towed array
hosewall. System performance will be demonstrated through prototype
evaluation and modeling or analytical methods over the required range of
 parameters, including toe testing and critical array self-noise
properties.  Evaluation results will be used to refine the prototype
into an initial design that will meet Navy requirements.  The company
will prepare a Phase III development plan to transition the technology
to Navy use.    PHASE III: If the Phase II prototype is successful, the
company will work with the Navy and array manufacturers to transition
the new cable design into existing systems. The company will be expected
 to support the Navy in transitioning the technology for Navy use.  The
company will develop a Fat Line towed array hosewall according to the

Paint Gloss on Visual and Near IR Detection",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate the
analytical means to model the visual through near infrared detection of
an air vehicle with specularly reflecting top coat finishes.
DESCRIPTION: Program Offices are trying to reduce operation and
maintenance (O &amp; M) costs and need to understand the susceptibility
trade-offs between the gloss, semi-gloss, and flat topcoat finishes.
Glossy paints are less prone to environmental degradation, especially
service fluids, which reduce maintenance costs as compared to flat,
or"camouflage"paints.  However, flat paints reduce the susceptibility of
 aircraft to detection as the reflective characteristics of flat paints
typically yield a more diffuse distribution of reflected energy, i.e.,
less susceptible to glints or persistent glares.    The Navy currently
has an excellent capability with the SPIRITS code to model mid wave and
long wave infrared detection for air vehicles with a diffuse (flat)
topcoat finish.  The Navy's modeling capability is deficient for more
specular surfaces down in the visual and near infrared spectrum.
Semigloss and gloss finish paints are examples of specular surfaces.
This task is intended to expand the Navy's capability and proficiency
with the available analytical codes to include the visible and near
infrared spectrum.  We need to fully understand the survivability
implications of changing from flat paint schemes to more glossy paint
schemes.    Beginning with a selection of simple shapes and moving on to
 full scale air vehicles, the contractor will model the differences in
radiance and detection range achieved by using several FED-STD-595B
colors of various surface finishes of MIL-PRF-85285 topcoats.  The
colors to be studied include: blue-green 25237 and 35237, white 17925,
27925, 37925, and gray 26373 and 36373.  Variants of a specific color or
 close commercial surrogates are negotiable.  The modeling effort shall
be focused heavily in the visible and near IR spectrum.  For calculation
 of detection ranges in Phase II, use the human eye as the threat sensor
 for the visible spectrum.  Threat sensor data in the near IR spectrum
will be provided during Phase II.    PHASE I: Develop and demonstrate
the capability to accurately model the radiance of reflected solar
energy from simple shapes (flat plate, cylinder, sphere) painted with
flat, semi-gloss and gloss versions of the paints specified in the
description above.  The selected contractor(s) will need the capability
to acquire the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)
and directional hemispherical reflectance (DHR) data required to
complete this task.  Clearly define all technical assumptions and any
known shortfalls.  Develop a plan of action and milestones to expand the
 analysis to a full scale air vehicle.    PHASE II: Apply modeling
techniques and lessons from Phase I on a full scale CH-53E and\/or other
 Navy air vehicle under consideration for changes to paint scheme.  Use
this model to calculate differences in detection range between the
various paint schemes. The government will work with the contractor to
generate a suitable geometric model of the selected air vehicle.  The
outcome of this phase would involve actual air vehicle signatures and
therefore be classified.  The selected contractor(s) must have the
capability to work with classified data up to the SECRET level.    PHASE
 III: Transition the data and lessons learned from the previous two
phases to the relevant government agencies that can use these analytical
 codes.  Improvements and modifications to codes developed under this
effort may be marketed to any other customers of the codes, however,
signatures and\/or detection ranges of specific air vehicles may not.

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate a prototype
system for automated deployment and retrieval (D &amp; R) of a towed
body from a small surface platform in a high sea state.    DESCRIPTION:
The Navy is developing towed underwater systems that are deployed and
retrieved (D &amp; R) from surface vessels.  D &amp; R of these
underwater systems is sea-state limited, due to wave-induced relative
motion.  This topic focuses on the"near-field"challenges of D &amp; R of
 a tethered underwater body, the period of time during which the towed
underwater body and surface vessel are in close proximity and on
managing\/mitigating the relative motions to minimize chances of
collision and damage.  It also focuses on automation of the D &amp; R
process, the ability to cross-deck the D &amp; R system between various
surface vessels, and analysis of mechanical stresses of D &amp; R system
 and deck loads.  The key technical risk is the motion between the 2
platforms.  This topic solicits innovative approaches that employ, for
example, state-of-the-art computational modeling, short-term platform
motion forecasting algorithms, mechanical and inflatable structures to
minimize impacts of a collision and automated D &amp; R.  The Topic will
 focus on surface craft of 7-12 m in length operating in SS 4 and towed
bodies of 300-2000 lbs.  In addition, the ability to operate with a
freeboard of up to 6 meters is of key importance due to future desire to
 operate the D &amp; R system from a larger surface vessel.    Several
previous projects have addressed the problem of automated D &amp; R of a
 Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) from a USV, for example, STTR
N07-T037, and the ongoing ONR Single Sortie Detect-to-Engage program.
These have made progress in far-field capture of the UUV and recovery of
 the UUV on the USV in low SS or in higher SS with a human in-the-loop.
 This topic extends the previous work to high SS, which is a technically
 challenging problem, and addresses the issue of D &amp; R from
platforms with high freeboard.    PHASE I: Develop a concept design for a
 D &amp; R system according to the parameters listed in the Description

(3) the M &amp; S approach and results, in view of the considerations in

 R system in on-water tests.  Phase II deliverables shall include: (1)
the prototype system, (2) the detailed design, and (3) a report

and retrieve prototype using transition program"s towed asset and
participate in a Fleet Experiment.  Phase III deliverables shall include
 a report describing on-water test approach, metrics and results.

        "topic_name": "Threat Agnostic, Guided Expendable Decoy
(TAgGED)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a threat agnostic expendable
decoy that has a guided trajectory, fits in a standard decoy dispenser
and significantly improves the probability of decoy success over current
 countermeasure techniques.    DESCRIPTION: Military aircraft can be
attacked by anti-aircraft missiles that are designed to impact the
aircraft and initiate a warhead.  These aircraft often have a
self-protection procedure of sensing incoming missiles and deploying an
expendable decoy to lure the missile away from the targeted aircraft.
However, once the expendable is deployed its trajectory is usually
uncontrolled and the effectiveness of the decoy can be compromised by
non-optimal positioning of the decoy and the aircraft within the missile
 seeker"s field of view.  The purpose of this project is to advance
decoy technology by improving the trajectory control of deployed decoys.
  A decoy with a controlled trajectory capable of interposing itself
between the missile and the targeted aircraft, and presenting a more
desirable target to the anti-aircraft threat, would significantly
increase its effectiveness.  In addition, guidance control opens the
possibility to optimize decoy trajectories so that their effectiveness
is always maximized.  In order to achieve this advance, expendables need
 to be designed to include thrusters and propellant sufficient to
achieve and maintain the desired trajectory, guidance command and
control hardware, and an obscurant\/decoy payload, while still achieving
 a form factor to permit deployment from a standard aircraft decoy
dispenser (e.g. Navy\/Marine Corps AN\/ALE-47 Aircraft Chaff\/Flare
Dispenser).  The allowable decoy trajectory needs to be controlled such
that it is capable of progressively moving away from the aircraft it is
protecting while maintaining a position in between the aircraft and the
incoming threat.  Once it is in this position, the decoy would then be
maneuvered to draw the threat away from the aircraft.  The goal of this
project is to develop a guided expendable decoy concept, perform a trade
 study and an optimized system design, fabricate and test a prototype
system, and transition the technology to the fleet.    PHASE I: Develop a
 guided expendable decoy concept that fits into a standard decoy
dispenser.  The expendable should be approximately 5.8 inches in length,
 1.4 inches in diameter and weigh less than 400 grams.  Longer and
heavier expendable designs would require justification.  The company
will quantify the benefits of their design using a designer's trade
space for current\/anticipated threats.  The company will make a design
recommendation and demonstrate the feasibility of achieving the
requirements described above and will establish that the concept can be
developed into a useable product for the Navy.  The design
recommendation and trade space will address capabilities such as flight
duration, maneuverability, volume available for payload, etc.  The
company will provide a Phase II development plan that addresses
technical risk reduction and provides performance goals and key
technical milestones.    PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and
the Phase II development plan, the company will develop a prototype that
 demonstrates the guided expendable capabilities.  The prototype will be
 evaluated to determine its capability in meeting Phase II performance
goals and Navy requirements. The company will prepare a Phase III
development plan to transition the technology to Navy use.    PHASE III:
 Upon successful results at the end of Phase II, the company will be
expected to support the Navy in continuing the transition of the
developed guided expendable technology through the RAPIER FNC.  The
business will produce a guided expendable for evaluation to determine
its effectiveness in an operationally relevant environment and will
provide support for test and validation to certify and qualify the new
technology in navy systems.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL

        "topic_name": "Flexible Solid State High Power Radio Frequency
(HPRF) Test Capability",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop HPRF architectures capable of
 generating arbitrary waveforms with frequency and bandwidth agility
using solid-state systems for counter electronics vulnerability testing.
    DESCRIPTION: Most current high power (MW class) radio frequency
(HPRF) test sources are limited to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
vacuum electronics based technologies.  These sources are inherently
limited in waveform flexibility with respect to frequency, bandwidth,
pulse-width and duty cycle [1].  While solid-state power amplifiers
offer increased waveform flexibility and continuous wave (CW) operation,
 they are limited to single kW levels.  Navy laboratories require a
flexible test capability to support both vulnerability and
susceptibility work at power levels greater than the current
state-of-the-art amplifier technology can provide.  The test capability
will provide critical data to inform future technology development
efforts for emerging high power solid state technology.  A core dataset
is required for these novel waveforms to provide technology maturation
goals.     Potential technological solutions include, but are not
limited to, non-linear transmission lines (NLTL) and photoconductive
semiconductor switches (PCSS).  In the case of the NLTLs, the output is
varied via physical alteration of the system, variable driver parameters
 and magnetic biasing.  PCSS systems have the potential to achieve
purely arbitrary outputs, but require large and costly laser systems.
In both cases, materials research has, and will continue to, play a
leading role in their development.  A potential solution may also take
advantage of a modular design, arrayed elements, or other power
combining techniques; however, a high power, broadband power combiner
design will require special attention and should be described in detail.
    The proposed concept demonstrator should be able to transmit an
arbitrary waveform at power levels of 10 MW at a minimum, with an
objective power output of 100 MW and a rep-rate on the order of kHz in
the range of VHF to S-band.  The prototype design should include all
elements of the devices including prime power, power conditioning,
control hardware, thermal management, RF source, RF transition, and
antenna.    PHASE I: Conceptualize, design, and model key elements for
an innovative, all solid-state, arbitrary waveform, HPRF source.  The
design should establish realizable technological solutions for a device
capable of achieving output power levels of 10 MW, at a minimum, and
rep-rates on the order of kHz in the frequency range of VHF to S-band.
The proposed design should be an 80% complete solution and include all
sub-systems from prime power up through the RF source and antenna.  The
design should include circuit modeling and analysis of both the HPRF
source and any critical support system elements such as a high voltage
(HV) driver.  The proposed brassboard system should be designed for
vehicle portability, i.e. contained in\/on a pallet or trailer.  The
antenna design is not the focus of this SBIR; however, the chosen
solution, whether a novel design, COTS or interchangeable antenna
arrangement should be supported by modeling and simulation efforts.
Additional modeling and simulation should be performed to determine
predicted efficiency, prime power, and thermal management requirements.
An overview of the current state of the art for each of the key
prototype elements along with manufacturer information should also be
provided, focusing on the solid state components required for this
application.  Cost analysis as well as material development should be
included so as to ascertain critical needs not yet fully developed or
readily available given current technology.    PHASE II: Phase II will
involve the design refinement, procurement, integration, assembly, and
testing of a proof of concept brassboard prototype leveraging the Phase I
 effort.  The Phase II brassboard prototype will be capable of greater
than 500 kW output at a rep-rate of 100"s of Hz.  The brassboard system
should be capable of operating in a laboratory environment, such as an
anechoic chamber or Gigahertz Transverse Electromagnetic (GTEM) test
cell.  This brassboard prototype must demonstrate a clear path forward
to a full scale concept demonstrator based on the selected technology.
Data packages on all critical components will be submitted throughout
the prototype development cycle and test results will be provided for
regular review of progress.  The use of actual hardware and empirical
data collection is expected for this analysis.  A refined design package
 should also be submitted that meets the solicitation threshold of an
HPRF arbitrary waveform source capable of power levels exceeding 10 MW,
with an objective of 100 MW, and a rep-rate on the order of kHz.
PHASE III: The performer will apply the knowledge gained during Phase I
and II to build and demonstrate a full scale prototype device capable of
 transmitting an arbitrary waveform at power levels exceeding 10 MW and a
 rep-rate on the order of kHz.  The prototype will represent a complete
solution and include all system elements including prime power, power
conditioning, control hardware, thermal management, RF source, RF
transition, and antenna.  The prototype should be ruggedized for, at a
minimum, testing in an outdoor environment and be environmentally
enclosed.  The prototype will be applicable for direct test range use
within government or with a commercial partner against candidate test
articles relevant to EMI or HERO testing and validation relative to
perceived threats and system vulnerabilities.    Potential utility in a
non-lethal, non-kinetic engagement option against a wide variety of
electronic targets will be considered depending on potential platforms,
pulse flexibility as well as size\/weight\/power requirements.

unmanned surface vessels, but some such as the Remote Multi-Mission
Vehicle described in reference [3] have most of their hull submerged
during launch or recovery.      The AFSB configuration, based on the
Mobile Landing Platform (MLP) hull shown in reference [1], was modified
to function as a host platform for manned and unmanned vehicles
performing mine warfare and Special Forces operations.  The AFSB must
have the capability of launching and recovering vehicles for these
operations over a variety of environmental conditions.  The MLP hull is
765 feet long and has a beam of 164 feet with a displacement of
approximately 34,500 tons and should provide good sea-keeping
performance with the exception of long period waves at specific relative
 wave headings.  It is the smaller mission systems that will be
particularly affected by wind and wave conditions and that will make
launch and recovery operations outside the shelter of a well deck a
challenge.  As discussed in reference [5] the use of conventional cranes
 or davits without the assistance of sensing or control for motion
compensation on a vessel in an open sea can result in uncontrolled
pendulation with the potential for injury or damage to the host platform
 and mission payload.  Also mentioned in reference [5], is the
expectation that rescue boat operations can be executed through sea
state 6 conditions.    The desired approach should focus on the launch
and recovery system on the host platform providing the sensing and
control required rather than making significant modifications to mission
 systems or vehicles.  The mission systems were largely developed
without the sensing and control technology that would enable automated
launch and recovery of the vehicles.  In order to maintain commonality
of these systems when employed on other platforms such as the Littoral
Combatant Ship (LCS) no modifications that significantly affect size,
weight, power requirements or interfere with essential mission
capabilities are acceptable.  Therefore, all sensing or control for
launch and recovery must reside solely on the host platform.  Solutions
could include active motion tracking by the recovery apparatus of the
mission vehicle as well as mechanisms for motion mitigation.  Other
potential solutions could involve assisted control of manned and
unmanned vehicles and thus must be compatible with vehicles that might
be under manual control, either onboard or remotely, or operating
autonomously.  Particularly beneficial would be means to enhance the
safety of launch and recovery of manned vessels, typically Rigid-Hulled
Inflatable Boats (RHIBS).     The AFSB launch and recovery system must
be versatile.  It should be capable of launch and recovery of various
mine warfare and special operations vehicles either without
reconfiguration or with a quickly reconfigurable design.    PHASE I:
Develop and assess feasibility of concepts for the launch and recovery
of manned and unmanned systems that enhance the capability of the AFSB
to perform its missions.  Modeling and simulation should be performed to
 substantiate key performance attributes such as robust operation
throughout a range of sea conditions.  Identify sensor and control
architectures and system performance parameters in conceptual design.
Phase I Option efforts could include hardware-in-the-loop simulation.
 PHASE II: Develop a preliminary design based on Phase I results.
Demonstrate via physical modeling of a proof-of-concept launch and
recovery system or significant unique technology components.  Develop
full-scale detailed designs that include documentation of the interface
to the AFSB and estimated costs for fabrication and installation.
PHASE III: Fabrication of a full-scale prototype launch and recovery
system, installation onboard the AFSB, and demonstration in a relevant
operational environment.  Develop and provide documentation to support
operation and maintenance of the prototype.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL

demonstrate the use of an optimizable aluminum alloy composition and
associated additive manufacturing process for the advanced fabrication
of gear boxes, to exceed the mechanical and chemical properties of
investment cast A357.    DESCRIPTION: Cast magnesium alloys are used
extensively in the fabrication of helicopter gear boxes because they are
 lightweight.  Unfortunately, magnesium alloys have serious corrosion
challenges and must be protected, inspected, and maintained via costly
and time consuming sustainment procedures in order to ensure safe
operation.  Cast aluminum alloys are beginning to replace some magnesium
 castings because of their higher corrosion resistance.  Unfortunately,
industry has experienced challenges consistently producing the complex,
quality aluminum casting needed with the strength and weight comparable
to magnesium.          Additive manufacturing (AM), a process in which a
 part is fabricated layer by layer from a digital design package, offers
 the potential to produce complex components at reduced cost, and time.
 AM has the potential to conserve material, reduce energy consumption,
part cost, and fabrication time.  However, in order to use AM
effectively, new aluminum alloys need to be developed that take
advantage of the AM process in order to enhance strength and reduce
weight.     To-date, only two traditional aluminum casting alloys have
been used in the AM of aluminum components.  However, these alloys were
designed for casting operations in which alloy viscosity and elemental
partitioning during solidification (10 deg\/sec) must be minimized at
the expense of strength, ductility, and fatigue resistance.  A new class
 of alloys is needed to take advantage of the much faster cooling rates
(&gt;1000 deg\/sec) and unique processing condition used during AM.
 PHASE I: Demonstrate the feasibility of a new or optimized aluminum
alloy composition for powder\/feedstock material via an additive
manufacturing process; focusing on alloy composition optimization for
resulting initial mechanical properties (modulus, etc.) and effects on
homogeneity and microstructure as a function of deposition and cooling
rate.    PHASE II: Optimize, select, and demonstrate the full mechanical
 (strength, toughness, stiffness, modulus, etc.) and chemical (density,
durability, galvanic, substrate and coating compatibility, etc.)
properties for the new or optimized AM aluminum alloy composition(s);
with the"as-cast"investment cast A357 as the baseline
fabrication\/processing and material property improvement, including
relative cost\/time to produce and sustain.  Require demonstration of
both static and fatigue strength of equivalent or superior performance
to as-cast investment cast A357.    PHASE III: Transition alloy
composition to commercial supply via OEM, bulk material vendors, or
other partnering agreement.  Demonstrate and transition AM process
controls and settings to FRC and other DoD production\/maintenance
facilities.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE
APPLICATIONS: Commercial aviation, automotive and industrial
applications for advanced fabrication of lighter, stronger, more durable
 aluminum alloy drive system components via an AM process. Additional
DoD transition opportunities in ground and amphibious vehicle components
 should also be pursued at this time if resulting properties and process
 requirements so warrant.",

        "topic_name": "Advance Growth Methods for Aligned and Ultra-long
 Carbon Nanotubes for Naval Applications",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop new manufacturing
approaches that allow the growth of ultra-long or continuous carbon
nanotubes (CNTs), with low but controlled defect density, with
controlled number of CNT walls, and high CNT density and alignment.  The
 primary target application is structural, in the form of yarns, mats,
prepegs, or nanocomposites but other applications such as electrical
wires, electrodes, and cables are envisioned.    DESCRIPTION: Despite
incremental morphological advances in this class of materials over the
last 10 years, there are but a few companies that are able to
manufacture small amounts of  continuous yarns and mats made of short
CNTs (between 0.1 - 1 mm).  Of these, their thermal, electrical and
mechanical properties are still between 5 and 10 times lower than the
ultimate properties that this material could achieve.  For example, the
measured strain to failure for current CNT Yarn is only 1.5%, compared
to 1.8% for standard IM7 carbon fiber and a predicted value of close to
20% for a continuous CNT.    What is limiting the attainment of the
predicted, ultimate  properties (and broadest use) of Carbon Nanotubes
(CNTs) for structural, electrical, and thermal applications is our
inability to grow these materials with an ultra-long or continuous
length scale, with high densities, good alignment, and controlled defect
 densities at affordable costs.  Paramount to this endeavor is the
control of all aspects (geometrical, chemical, physical) of the catalyst
 particle, substrate, and growth environment.  Any innovative growth
methodology must be able to control at a minimum: the temperature of the
 catalyst particles; the supply of carbon feedstock and other gases into
 the processing chamber to optimize the supply of carbon to the catalyst
 particles; minimization  of amorphous, carbonaceous  or other
poisonous deposits on the catalysts; immobilization of the catalyst
particle either via chemical alloying or substrate texturing;
deleterious inter CNT friction effects during growth due to differences
in growth rates; the size and shape of the catalyst particles during
growth; the CNT growth rate, and many other parameters.  Novel,
integrated substrate, reactor, and process control designs are needed
for effective management of the above conditions to allow the next
technical leap in CNT properties.      The ultimate goal is to attain
the growth of ultra-long or continuous carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with low
 but controlled defect density, controlled number of CNT walls (or with a
 narrow distribution of diameters), and high density and alignment.  Any
 small business submitting a proposal under this topic must have
demonstrated previous experience in growing CNTs and clearly articulate
how their new and innovative approach to CNT growth will control all the
 parameters mentioned above (and possibly many others).     PHASE I: The
 contractor will perform a laboratory scale demonstration of a new or
improved: substrate; or reactor configuration; or catalyst; or any other
 process parameter for growth of high quality, dense, aligned and
ultra-long (&gt;1 inch) or continuous Carbon Nanotubes (CNT).  Precise
control of catalyst composition, temperature, geometry, surface
distribution, and anchoring method shall be demonstrated during CNT
growth.  Precise control of substrate texturing (via chemical or
mechanical means) for feed stock gas distribution optimization, for
controlling the size of a CNT bundles, for anchoring the catalyst
particles or for other purposes shall be demonstrated.  Accurate process
 control of carrier gases, carbon and catalyst feed stock gas
chemistries, and gas temperature and pressure also shall be
demonstrated.  The contractor will grow CNTs with said process and
processing chamber improvements and will measure their growth rate,
ultimate length, diameter, crystallinity, areal density, and degree of
alignment and will provide the data in a statistical format with a
minimum average and standard distribution values.  The contractor with
the best overall values and most promising process in terms of
scalability will move to the Phase II effort.    PHASE II: During the
Phase II program the contractor will further develop, optimize and scale
 up the new technique demonstrated during Phase I and demonstrate the
capability to manufacture continuous yarns (either of discreet,
ultra-long , aligned CNTs or of continuous CNTs).  The contractor will
manufacture CNT yarns of several diameters ranging in size from 1
micrometer to several microns.  The awardees will characterize the yarns
 elastic constant, strength, and strain to failure for various gauge
lengths.  The small business will also start exploring steps to lower
the material manufacturing costs by possibly recycling process gases,
increasing growth rates, scaling up the process, or other approaches.
 PHASE III: The commercialization of the technology will be dependent
upon the success of Phase I and II of the SBIR topic.  Current naval
needs for the technology are in the main rotor Hub in the H-1
helicopter, delamination resistant tail rotor flex beams in the CH-53K
helicopter and thermally active nano-composites for de-icing
applications in the MQ-4C Triton UAV.  Which program will benefit most
will not become clear until the program is well underway and at least
the Phase II base is completed.  At that time and appropriate program
will be targeted.  The commercial and military applications of a
continuous and dense CNT fiber manufacturing process are endless.  In
addition to naval applications, the contractor will also pursue
independent commercial applications in the sporting goods, transport,
electronic and energy sectors.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL
POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: The commercial aviation and shipping
industry would benefit significantly from this new, low cost material
form.  The need for lightweight structural composites for next
generation DoD naval platforms (ships, subs, and aircraft) also occurs
in commercial counterparts.  The commercial applications for this
technology are very broad because of the extraordinary mechanical,
electrical, and thermal properties that this material affords.
Potential uses can be found in the transportation sector (primarily for
aviation); in the energy sector (directly in the form of low resistance
wires or high surface area electrodes); and in the space sector (for
light weight structures and components; i.e. telescope baffles).",

line, minimum thermal conduction, flexible ribbon cable in coplanar and
low crosstalk versions using MgB2 conductors.  All types of signals
(analog RF signal to 100 GHz, DC and AC power, and random digital data
at high clock speed) will be delivered down this cabling.
DESCRIPTION: The recently announced IARPA C3 program will demonstrate
that superconducting electronics (SCE) at 4K can reduce the total energy
 consumption of 10's of petaflop computing by more than 10X and volume
by even more.  Capitol ships increasingly need computational resources
of this capacity for situational awareness, yet communications and ship
functionality is being constrained by power requirements.  However,
cables that bring power into the 4K environment, and the data output
cables, conduct a great deal of heat from the room down into the cold
environment that must then be removed.  If easily connected flexible
cables with superconducting MgB2 conducting traces could span the
temperature gradient between 30 and 4K this parasitic heat load could be
 sharply reduced, improving total system energy efficiency.  The data
cables will be useful for RF signal input in the SCE situational
awareness receivers needed for information dominance, especially where
element level digital beam forming is used.  Connectors that have low
contact resistance despite high vibration settings and repeated make and
 break cycles and high isolation between traces will be hardest goals to
 achieve.    PHASE I: The product of the Phase I base effort will be a
technical report documenting experimental validation of the cable
concept outlined in the initial proposal using a short length sample
that is wire bonded for testing.  Success requires the magnesium
diboride (MgB2) conductors and any supporting substrate to exhibit lower
 thermal conduction than an equivalent length copper multi-trace cable
spanning the same temperature gradient and carrying the same current.
The Phase I option, if awarded should include selection and design of
the connectorization.  A Phase II plan should be defined during the
final weeks of the Phase I base award and presented in its final report.
    PHASE II: Phase II will include multiple cycles of
design\/fabrication\/test\/model activities to demonstrate rugged
connectorization and to deliver cables with more than an order of
magnitude lower thermal parasitics and lower resistive loss than
equivalent delivered by Cu or CuBe when the cable spans 4 to 30K and
carries same signals.  Ease of connectorization and simplicity of
connection and reconnection should also be worked to mature the product.
    PHASE III: Transition for this cable product will consist of its
incorporation into one of a kind, first prototype 4K (or lower)
superconducting systems in DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC).
This integration will be undertaken because of the simulated reduction
of system parasitic heat loading (thus operating power) and reduction in
 the hand labor associated with lead installation and maintenance.

 to simultaneously handle 100"s of diverse, possibly overlapping signals
 for multi-functional situational awareness.    DESCRIPTION: A new
Digital Signal Processing (DSP) subsystem is needed that allows
optimized, multi-threaded signal classification in as near real-time as
possible.  At a minimal, the subsystem should operate on a stream (from a
 first-in first-out memory buffer) of a single wideband representation
of 500 MHz+ of spectrum.  Signals within this spectrum will contain a
mix of known and well-behaved signals as well as unknown signals with
unknown behaviors or properties.  The subsystem should handle numerous
simultaneous signals (at least 30 with a goal of 100+) and be able of
classify signals that shift their center frequency unpredictably, lie
wholly or partially on top of other signals, have inherently low signal
to noise ratios, or use non-commercial standard waveforms.  The DSP
threads should track known signals, classify unknown signals, or do a
exhaustive search of a specific time\/frequency swath to identify new or
 unknown signals for further classification or tracking.  The ideal
system should be composed of commercially available parts such as
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), digital signal processors (DSP),

(GPP) or hybrids thereof with a shared-memory architecture for extremely

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop adaptive radar mode
approaches to provide improvement in performance in highly variable
maritime clutter conditions while utilizing available radar resources
for wide area coverage.    DESCRIPTION: All airborne maritime surface
search radars experience reduced detection performance in high clutter
environments that typically limits their operational flight altitude.
Operating at lower altitudes limits overall mission effectiveness in
terms of area coverage for radar typically decreased platform fuel
efficiency (higher burn rate).  In addition, detection performance in
small target modes is degraded in high clutter environments, even at
these lower operating altitudes.  Many current radar systems employ a
fast revisit rate approach.  These non-coherent modes require high peak
radiated power and a high gain narrow antenna beam-width in azimuth for
further mean clutter rejection.  The remaining clutter that must be
rejected primarily consists of sea spikes that can last for multiple
seconds.  These must be dealt with using sophisticated tracking
techniques.  This topic seeks to develop a mode structure and associated
 signal processing that leverages longer integration time for Doppler
beam forming on the coherent component of the sea clutter and
de-correlation relative to the target on the non-coherent component, and
 allows for other radar modes (high range resolution and inverse
synthetic aperture radar) to be effectively interleave in order to take
advantage of additional target classification discriminates.  The
approach should be applicable to both mechanically scanned and

technologies to improve the performance of two-phase heat exchangers.
 DESCRIPTION: Tube-fin heat exchangers are used to acquire or reject
heat in a wide range of military and commercial thermal control systems,
 including ground and sea-based environmental control units,
refrigeration systems, and waste heat regeneration systems.  As
power-density of tactical systems continue to increase, the use of
two-phase thermal control systems is becoming more widespread due to
improved thermal capacity when cooling or heating through the latent
heat of a working fluid.  Improving the effectiveness of two-phase heat
exchangers used to transfer heat between the working fluids and air
streams will lead to reductions in size, weight, and power consumption
of military environmental control systems.    Improved heat exchanger
designs utilizing microchannels, plate-fin configurations, and surface
enhancements offer performance advantages over traditional tube-fin heat
 exchangers, but have not yet been fully utilized in many military and
commercial systems.  While developers have incorporated these
improvements in single-phase systems, they have yet to be utilized
reliably with two-phase systems.  This is largely due to two-phase flow
maldistribution and condensation build-up in the heat exchanger, which
results in poor heat transfer performance, as well as high manufacturing
 costs.    Technologies are sought to improve the volumetric heat
transfer performance over tube-fin heat exchangers while maintaining
flow rates, temperatures, and differential pressures characteristic of
heat exchangers used for environmental control.  Methods to ensure
proper distribution of a two-phase mixture at the entrance to multiple
fluid passages and through the device must be proven.    PHASE I:
Develop concepts to provide improved heat transfer performance over
conventional heat exchangers and provide a uniform distribution of a
two-phase working fluid at the inlets to multiple fluid passages.
Validate design performance through analytical modeling or subscale
demonstration of components as appropriate.    PHASE II: Demonstrate a

state-of-the-art currently only 2-3 dB across the desired bandwidth.
Furthermore, emerging architectures are limited in power handling
capability to tens of Watts or perhaps kW. The antenna is a critical
sub-system that has not evolved to handle the diversity of HPRF
waveforms and the MW power levels required in directed energy
applications. Effective delivery of HPRF is made even more challenging
with the complexities that arise with integration of antenna structures
onto unmanned platforms, munitions, or other air delivered employment
concepts. In typical antenna design, the physical size plays an
important role in the gain and power handling capability, which leads to
 extreme challenges when requiring a compact, conformal, and lightweight
 design for proper system integration. Another key consideration is the
intended operating environment of the system, of greatest interest for
this effort is a naval environment. The antenna must be able to
withstand large temperature fluctuations, maritime weathering (salt,
wind, rain), and continuous UV exposure. Typical high power systems
experience catastrophic degradation in this environment if not addressed
 with proper environmental mitigation techniques (i.e. radomes, UV
protected dielectrics, etc.). Innovative improvements to the antenna
architecture and\/or materials are needed to achieve the higher gains
necessary for increased range and could prove to be the critical factor
in transitioning HPRF technology to the warfighter. A novel, compact,
moderate-gain antenna design for MW+ powers is required with improved
directionality to keep pace with the miniaturization of emerging HPRF
technologies.    PHASE I: Perform a technology review of existing
antenna technologies to determine the design feasibility and potential
implementations of an antenna with moderate gain (10-15 dB) and compact
size (less than 0.25 m^3), capable of operations at peak powers of 100
MW to 1 GW with repetitive pulse operation at 100s of Hz, and a
characteristic impedance between 50 to 150 Ohms. Research efforts should
 also be made to determine the current limitations of antenna technology
 at the MW power levels for the volume specified and determine if any of
 the low power architecture technological solutions can be applied to
achieve higher gain and\/or powers. A down select of existing antenna
technology should be conducted with a focus on determining what
technologies provide the most useful capability for short pulse, MW
class power operation while meeting the volumetric requirements. These
antennae will be driven by an assortment of high voltage based RF
sources, with pulse lengths shorter than 1 s while utilizing damped
sinusoid waveforms. This variation in sources leads to a requirement for
 a flexible, center frequency tunable antenna with a bandwidth of at
least 20-30%, if not much broader. Efficient methods for numerical
computation of electromagnetic and antenna radiation, new materials,
devices and radiating systems for miniaturization and performance
enhancement of the wideband antenna should be included in this analysis.
 Flexibility across bands, manufacturability, and real-time frequency
reconfigurable antennas are stressed. The completion of Phase I will
include the development of novel antenna designs to meet the outlined
requirements using computational electromagnetic modeling and
simulation, building on the antenna development for commercial
applications at lower powers derived from the technology review efforts.
 The conceptual designs, along with the design implementation and
antenna performance models should be included as well as a cost analysis
 and material development so as to ascertain critical needs not yet
fully developed or readily available given current technology.    PHASE
II: Phase II will involve the design refinement, procurement,
integration, assembly, and testing of a proof of concept prototype
leveraging the Phase I effort. The Phase II prototype will have a gain
(10-15 dB), a compact size (less than 0.5 m^3), and be capable of
greater than 50 MW to 500 MW output at a rep-rate of 10s of Hz, and a
characteristic impedance between 50 to 150 Ohms. The prototype should
also be capable of operating in an outdoor environment. This prototype
must demonstrate a clear path forward to a full scale prototype based on
 the selected technology. Data packages on all critical components will
be submitted throughout the prototype development cycle and test results
 will be provided for regular review of progress. The development of
actual hardware and empirical data collection is expected for this
analysis. A refined design package should also be submitted that meets
the solicitation objectives with moderate gain (10-15 dB), compact size
(less than 0.25 m^3), and operations at peak powers of 100 MW to 1 GW
with repetitive pulse operation at 100s of Hz.    PHASE III: The
performer will apply the knowledge gained during Phase I and II to build
 and demonstrate a full scale prototype device capable of 10-15 dB gain,
 compact size (less than 0.25 m^3), and operations at peak powers of 100
 MW to 1 GW with repetitive pulse operation at 100s of Hz, and a
characteristic impedance between 50 to 150 Ohms. Data packages on all
critical components and subcomponents will be submitted throughout the
development cycle and test results will be submitted for regular review
of progress. The prototype will represent a complete solution and
include all system elements including the RF connectors, RF feed, RF
transition, and antenna. The prototype should be ruggedized for, at a
minimum, testing in a shipboard environment across a temperature range
of -20  degrees C to&gt;70  degrees C, MIL-STD shock and vibration, and
be environmentally enclosed.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL

 based small, passive, low-power sensors and in-node processing to
autonomously detect, classify and localize target vessels sufficiently
to facilitate a fire control solution for an autonomous weapon.
DESCRIPTION: This SBIR solicits innovative solutions for short range
small sensors (e.g. acoustic\/ magnetic\/ electric\/ pressure\/ seismic)
 and in-node processing capabilities that provide detection and
localization in such a way as to facilitate a fire control solution for
autonomous engagements.  The Research &amp; Development emphasis is to
tactically exploit the environment to achieve improved detection,
classification, localization and tracking (DCLT) or parts thereof for
engagement of sea-born vessels.  Sensing prototypes may include very
short range proximity sensors where tracking is not possible and the
sensor performance range limitation is adequate for a targeting
solution.  Sensing prototypes may also include longer range capability
configurations, where the capacity to localize or track is necessary for
 a targeting solution for the given weapon.  A nominal goal would be a
packaged sensing capability, of volume 30 cubic feet prior to
deployment, which provides a four nautical mile, shallow water barrier.
 For classification, innovative optical methods are of interest.  The
tracking capability would need to be in very low power firmware and
would be required to perform against very quiet targets in high ambient
noise environments.  Modeling and simulation are an important part of
the effort and shall be integrated appropriately with data analysis in
the development and testing of the technology solution.  This is to
ensure the performance capability is able to tolerate environment
variability, multiple targets, and a diverse set of surface and
submerged targets, as needed, for effective weapon performance.
PHASE I: Develop an innovative concept for low-power small sensors and
in-node processing for passive threat detection and localization that
meets the requirements outlined in the description.  Demonstrate the
feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy needs and establish that the
concept can be feasibly developed into a useful product for the Navy.
Feasibility may be established through simulation, data analysis and
analytical modeling.  Phase I should establish that the technology is
able to tolerate environment variability, multiple targets, a diverse
set of surface and submerged targets, and engagement performance.
Algorithm computational requirements must be addressed during Phase I
and demonstrated to be capable of deployment in a real time power
constrained system.  Required Phase I deliverables will include a Phase
II development plan that must address technical risk reduction and
provides performance goals and key technical milestones.    PHASE II:
Based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II development plan,
develop a prototype for evaluation.  The prototype will be evaluated to
determine its capability in meeting the performance goals defined in the
 Phase II development plan and the Navy requirements for the technology.
  Demonstrate system performance via thorough prototype evaluation
through in-situ testing, combined with modeling and simulation methods
over the required range of parameters and operational requirements.  Use
 evaluation results to refine the prototype into an initial design that
will meet classified Navy requirements provided during Phase II.  Use
algorithm and software modularity and open standards, that are not
platform specific, and accepts\/produces data according to a government
specified format.  Prepare a Phase III plan to transition the technology
 to Navy use.    PHASE III: Integrate the prototype according to the

        "topic_name": "Information Triage Engine: User-Composable
Automation for the Dynamic Management of Text-Based Information",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a scientifically-principled
design specification with supporting prototype concepts for a set of
advanced, user composable information management tools.  Tools would
enable warfighters to easily examine message traffic, email or other
data streams of text based information.  It would also enable
warfighters to categorize, meta-tag, alert or otherwise manage
information transactions based on natural language-like rules to support
 the execution of operations in the face of evolving missions with
dynamic tasking requirements.  Result will be a structured approach to
user-composable automation that enables warfighters to manage
information dynamically given real-time, emergent, missions and tasks.
  DESCRIPTION: Many military domains require agile, time-critical
decision making in order to maintain speed of command.  These domains
increasingly involve diverse and\/or complex missions with dynamic
information needs.  Current information systems often get in the way of
decision-making because they are data-centric, vice task-centric, and as
 a result require human decision-makers to manage large volumes of data
before they can address command tasks.  Warfighters are required to sort
 out what data is relevant to emergent tasks and mission demands.  Tools
 are needed that allow decision-makers to rapidly configure (or compose)
 automation for managing the flow of data from multiple sources as
needed to support emergent missions and tasks.  The tools should support
 publish and subscribe (pub\/sub), services oriented architecture.  This
 effort will result in the natural language management of modular,
reusable, and robust automation to be used with a variety of databases
and information processing tools.      Given the demands of modern
missions, automation must be easily composed by warfighters through
natural behavior and language mechanisms that do not require advance
programming skills.  Warfighters need to be able to demonstrate the
desired information management behaviors to the automation, and express
them through natural language transactions and\/or a graphical user
interface.  The desired Operator Machine Interfaces (OMIs) need to be
task-centric and support the task needs of decision makers.  The desired
 solution will result in an extensible strategy with supporting
information services that: 1) facilitate rapid, behaviorally based,
composition of information management in response to missions and tasks;
 2) be applicable to a wide range of information feeds and data; 3)
require minimal user training, 4) allow rapid insertion into DoD and
Navy Information Technology, C2 and combat systems, and 5) demonstrate
rapid end user adoption and utilization of the tools developed in
accordance with the design schema.  Resulting products will support
improved operational (e.g. combat system; command and control (C2))
decision making and reduced workload by providing a dynamic,
interaction-based mechanism for managing data based on mission and task
information context.  The desired tools are expected to enable command
staff to more rapidly plan, re-plan and execute missions in the face of
changing mission requirements and information needs. The desired
solution would represent an approach to a reusable Information Triage
Engine.      Desirable features would include:    Natural interface
(e.g. one which is behaviorally trained) for composing a workflow engine
 in response to task and mission demands.   Rapidly composed through
natural language and\/or behaviors.   Include mechanisms to support the
dynamic tagging of information with appropriate meta-tags   Incorporate
mechanisms to support iterative tuning of information management engine
processing rules.   Consider mechanisms to refine automation to include
negative (not) information, (e.g. to exclude certain categories of
information) as well as other relational arguments.   Support for
automated derivation of meta-tags based on mission &amp; task context
and user activity.   Demonstrate the generation of alerting rules for
(proactively) alerting the user to relevant information and\/or changing
 needs based on new\/upcoming events or text (i.e. context shifts)
Consider mechanized standardized information summaries.  These might
include template-based summaries for what information is\/i not
available in (and\/or is being aggregated into) data stores; as well as
context descriptors of time, location, and related mission(s) for which
the information was collected.   Demonstrate an ability to store
user-composed automation as rule sets for discovery &amp; reuse.
PHASE I: Phase I will address an approach for managing a stream of
text-based messages from at least one application\/database.  Develop
one or more use cases for how your proposed system will assist a
decision maker in the dynamic management of information.  Identify
relevant literature from cognitive decision making and human supervisory
 control of automation to develop requirements for decision support
needed for the proposed technology.  Design a concept prototype tool
with wireframe design elements to demonstrate interactions between human
 supervisor and anomaly detection technology. Define operational and
technical metrics that will permit the demonstration of the utility of
the approach in Phase II.  Propose notional elements for an extensible
decision support mechanisms by which warfighters might compose
automation for these elements that could then be dynamically adapted to
support mission execution and re-planning tasks.  Design and prototype a
 basic proof-of-concept decision support prototype capability that would
 demonstrate improved speed of command required to perform re-planning.
 Demonstrate through storyboards or a working prototype how users would
create, select and modify composable automation as needed, including
select from available algorithms and technologies.  Define and analyze
the requirements for determining mission and task management
requirements, and mission context for a specific information triage
task.  Show how automation would be managed for reuse by future users
and with other applications\/databases.  Phase I deliverables should
include a Final Phase I report that includes a detailed description of
the approach taken, as well as a detailed proposed approach for Phase II
 development.    PHASE II: Develop, demonstrate, and refine the Phase I
concept prototype.  Validate utility in human performance based
evaluations.  Demonstrate applicability to an operational domain
appropriate for the planned commercialization strategy (e.g. command and
 control).  The effectiveness of the system shall be demonstrated by
satisfying the utility metrics defined in Phase I, as well as additional
 metrics that may be developed in Phase II.  Develop a formal plan for
transition and commercialization.     1.  Mature, demonstrate, and
refine a concept prototype illustrating the decision support concept.
2.  Phase II demonstration to address information orchestration across
multiple applications\/databases.  Databases may include e-mail, naval
message traffic, social media, etc.   3.  Validate the decision support
concept and quantify its impact on decision making tasks with controlled
 human performance study with dynamically changing mission\/task
requirements with empirical, user-based performance data appropriate to
the anticipated transition end-user.  4.  Demonstrate that the schema
can accommodate a variety of different decision making tasks.  5.
Develop a transition strategy for insertion of the technology developed
into a US Navy Program of Record (e.g. BYG-1, GCCS-M) or a commercially
developed system.    Phase II deliverables will include a Final Phase II
 report that includes a detailed description of the approach taken and
results obtained in Tasks 1-5, and formal transition agreements or
commitments for external investments as part of a Phase III development
effort.    PHASE III: Refine the prototype and make its principal
features complete in preparation for transition and commercialization.
In addition to the DoD, there will be an increasing demand for
supervision of autonomous systems in the commercial sector, such as the
process control domain and commercial mining industries, and in federal
and state agencies such as law enforcement, emergency management, and
border protection.  These domains could benefit significantly from the
application of the solution developed in this effort.  In operational
command centers, it is expected that the developed tools would serve to
create user composable automation for critical mission events that would
 be applicable to Fleet command centers and shipboard combat centers
supporting anti-submarine warfare, or Area Access Denial missions.
PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: There is an
ever increasing demand for user-composable, readily extensible,
automation that enables the dynamic management of information.  Tools
for detecting, editing and responding to the concurrence of data from
disparate sources is endemic to modern life.  The desired technology
will have ready application to streaming web data accessed through
computers and personal electronic devices.  The desired technology would
 have ready application to next generation office automation providing
productivity gains to individuals and across organizations.  Composable
automation algorithms would create a new form of autonomous systems for
information management.  Further, these tools would become key enablers
to the supervision of autonomous systems in the commercial sector, such
as in the process control domain and commercial mining industries, and
in federal and state agencies such as law enforcement, emergency
management, and border protection.  Multiple application domains could
benefit significantly from the application of the solution developed in
this effort.",

Aluminum (Al) and Tungsten (W) powder neat and as composites.
DESCRIPTION: Today"s ordnance fills often contain substantial quantities
 of Al and W micron size powders to enhance blast and momentum effects.
 These metal powders demonstrate high efficiencies in propulsion
compositions, but do not provide similar combustion efficiencies during
detonation or impact driven events.  Innovative processing technology is
 sought to better define the scope and limitations of metal particle
combustion efficiencies and to identify the material properties that can
 be manipulated to enhance measured energy release.  Methodologies that
provide Al or W metal composites resulting in high combustion (50-80%)
efficiency within a 0.5-15 ms time frame are of interest.  The
improvements in combustion efficiency of micron sized metal composites
should be stable with time and environmental exposure.  Any processes
must be fully described and should be sufficiently adaptable and
scalable for production of well characterized materials.     During
deflagration, Al contributes only 10 to 25% of its potential energy
output, and W provides no measured enhancements.  Recent Army Research
Lab publications indicate shear phenomena in nanostructured W may
provide a pathway to higher combustion efficiencies.  Doping Al with
various metals results in lowered ignition temperatures, a potential
route to enhanced energy release mechanisms.  Other combinations of
workharden technologies (mechanochemistry) may provide insight into the
ignition and growth process for these metals.    PHASE I: This topic in
Phase I strives to: (1) Identify properties and mechanisms that increase
 energy release rates and combustion efficiencies of shock\/impact
initiated of aluminum and tungsten; (2) Develop and define concepts
which will increase combustion efficiencies of aluminum and tungsten;
(3) Provide experimental and test data supporting hypotheses.    PHASE
II: Based on the Phase I effort, demonstrate and validate the concept
identified for improving the impact initiated combustion efficiency of
aluminum and tungsten both neat and in formulations to be identified.
Deliver samples of the prototype solutions to the government for test
and evaluation in a government laboratory.  Work under Phase II might be
 classified.    PHASE III: Utilizing the concept successfully
demonstrated in Phase II, warhead components (cases or preformed
fragments) will be manufactured and delivered to government laboratories
 and\/or system integrators for evaluation in weapon applications.
PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: Pressed
metallic powder formulations have a range of uses beyond those relevant
to the military.  The ability to more readily combust Aluminum or

Composites",

thermo-chemical-based foundation needed to underlay the development of
advanced matrices with improved environmental robustness that can
mitigate the effects of coating loss (viz. CMC exposure to
moisture-induced volatilization or corrosive deposits), or matrix
cracking (leading to oxidative embrittlement of the CMC) in high
temperature gas turbine hot section components.    DESCRIPTION:
Implementation of SiC-based ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), in
propulsion engines of interest to the US Navy, is now a tangible
reality, representing the most fundamental change in design and
manufacturing practices for gas turbines since the introduction of
single crystal super-alloys.  However, application of SiC-based CMCs in
combustion environments requires the use of protective environmental
barrier coatings (EBCs) to prevent volatilization of the protective
silica scale from water vapor present in propulsion gases, as well as
attack from ingested ash, sand etc. (calcium-magnesium-alumino-silicate
(CMAS) attack).  The EBC only provides protection while present on the
surface.  Cracking and spallation of the coating leaves the underlying
SiC vulnerable to oxidation\/volatilization as well as other forms of
damage.  There is need for robust matrices, chemically tailored to
re-grow protective scales and to heal cracks extending into the CMC
itself.  To date, CMC matrices and EBCs have been developed
heuristically.  While both the thermo-mechanical performance of CMCs and
 the thermo-chemical behavior of EBCs have been addressed, the latter
arguably to a lesser degree, an integrated, science-based perspective
that can underpin the development of such systems approach has yet to
emerge.  The Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME)
strategy must include modeling approaches that can describe the relevant
 thermo-mechanical and thermo-chemical behavior of ceramic matrices, as
well as the overall system and its constituents, combined with
experimental approaches to generate requisite information for model
validation.  The capability to design and manufacture robust,
self-healing matrices would be invaluable for extending the durability
of critical gas turbine engine hot section components.  This will lead
to improved life management of these high value components and a
concomitant reduction in their sustainment costs.    PHASE I: Using ICME
 functionalities, establish models to predict the effect of composition
on phase stability and key properties in ceramic matrices such as
thermomechanical and thermochemical behavior, as well as thermodynamics
and kinetic to predict system evolution due to inter-diffusion between
constituents, phase transformations or interactions with the
environment.  The models should lead to application of self-healing
environmental barrier coatings that can withstand the rigors of
aggressive environments (such as 2400 deg F).   The ICME effort needs to
 be combined with experimental approaches to generate requisite
information for model validation.    PHASE II: Apply validated models,
developed in Phase I, to the synthesis of advanced matrices and
coatings, initially as monolithic materials and later in sub-systems and
 complete EBC\/CMC systems.  In coordination with an appropriate
original equipment manufacturer, establish and execute a test plan that
will provide sufficient data for preliminary assessment of design
allowables for critical and relevant design requirements.    PHASE III:
Adoption of models\/optimized matrix by an original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) for further maturation to manufacture robust
self-healing matrix CMC components that can operate in complex
environments with less maintenance, lower overall life cycle cost, and
improved operational capabilities.  The small business and the engine
OEM would work towards further maturation of the knowledge and\/or
process to fabricate CMC engine components for military and commercial

Mission planning involves understanding normal patterns of life (POL) so
 anomalies can be recognized.  For example, observed changes in imagery
over time has been used to derive POL for areas of interest.  This type
of data can be expressible as a vector of terms enabling expected and
estimates of change to be calculable as Euclidian distances from mean

distance calculation scales linearly with nodes, graph analytics do not.
  Spurred by social networking data, big graph approximate analytics are
 maturing towards linearity with nodes.  These developments empower
answers to questions such as who a person may know or personal
preferences.  POL calculations must consider more diverse data sets and
richer graph representations, calling for even more efficient distance
calculations.     Network analysis provides powerful means of studying
structural connections [1]. Of interest for this topic, is POL for
situation awareness.  Military and intelligence operators typically rely
 on their own data sources and analysis for determination of threat
activities.  Much of the data reported is of events unfolding or that
have already taken place; that is important for response; situation
assessment; and historical base-lining.  However, this data doesn't
provide normal POL that could serve as early indicators of change.  This
 topic will explore analytics of nontraditional open source data fused
with conventional data that can provide insight into anomalous
activities.     Nontraditional data sources can provide insight into
real time activity [2]. Examples of data include open source text,
satellite imagery available through search engines, video feeds of
vehicle traffic flow, video feeds from public areas available on the
Internet, public utility patterns (electricity, water, etc.), weather
station reports and many more.  It should be noted that combining
multiple diverse information sources into a unified graph that can be
mapped to POL indicators presents challenges.  For instance, how do we
assess quality of sources?  How do we normalize data types?  How do we
form graph structures?     The technical challenges of this topic are as
 follows: 1) automating collection of data for big graph formation; 2)
data enrichment and fusion  3)  construction and maintenance of a
dynamic big graph representation [3];  4) calculation of relevant static
 and dynamic POL metrics from very large and diverse graphs [4]; 5)
setting filters for event detection relevant to user needs (i.e.
location, time and tasking); 6) providing means to optimize data
collections over time by monitoring and adjusting data sources, (i.e.
user data needs and haves); and, 7) identifying analytic methods to
scale processing.  Practical system building needs to be considered as
well as metrics to measure development success.     Creative solutions
are desired.  Public data gathering should be done on a"not to
interfere"basis with providers and should comply with policies for use
of the data acquired.  Data used, and modeling methods, should be
relevant to potential customer for product transition, such as a
government agency, program of record or commercial market place.  Use of
 open standards is encouraged to reduce costs and improve system
interoperability.    PHASE I: Develop processes and techniques to
characterize the content, as it relates to patterns of life, of big
graphs over time.  The data behind graphs should contain information
extracted from diverse data sources.  Key technical risks should be
identified as well as key technical parameters that measure progress
against the risk areas.  Results from analysis and concept feasibility
tests should be documented in a technical report or paper at a selected
conference.  The final Phase I brief\/demonstration should show risk
reduction to the development of a fully responsive Phase II product as
well as plans for Phase I Option and Phase II.    PHASE II: Produce a
prototype system that is capable of detecting changes to features
describing patterns of life rapidly from dynamic large graphs populated
by multiple data types and providing mission relevant early threat
indicators all enabled by big graph analytics.  The prototype system
should be able to automatically process, display and alert on activity
discoveries relevant to the specific user location and mission
interests.  The system should support data acquisition, large graph data
 storage and analytics and alert dissemination.  It is desired that
context and pedigree of information be maintained for operator review.
At this point the performer should focus on a proof-of-concept of
capability using data sources that are of interest to a transition
program.  It is possible that some data sources of interest may be
classified secret such as multi-intelligence data (IMINT, HUMINT,
MASINT, ELINT).    PHASE III: Produce a system capable of deployment and
 operational evaluation.  The system should address POL indicators that
are of value to transition program or commercial application.  Machine
based processing steps and inferences about patterns of life should be
accessible by operator and presented in human understandable form.  The
software and hardware should be modified to operate in accordance with
guidelines provided by transition sponsor.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop an attention-based vision
system that will facilitate a higher-level reasoning in ground
autonomous systems by enabling these systems to actively identify,
observe, and focus on regions or objects of interest within complex
scenes without losing situational awareness.    DESCRIPTION: Autonomous
ground systems continue to promise a revolutionary technology that will
enable smaller units to expand their area of operation while maintaining
 the same control over the battlespace by enhancing sustainment,
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and maneuver for
distributed operations.  However, in most cases this promise remains
largely unfulfilled with unmanned ground systems still relying heavily
on human intervention in all but the most routine mission assignments.
The biggest impediment to date has been the failure for these systems to
 actively perceive the world as a series of semantically labeled
objects, events, and situations required for the generation and adaption
 of goals, priorities, and plans.  Computational limitations coupled
with the sheer complexity of the tactical environment have resulted in
highly specialized solutions that are brittle and not scalable from one
situation to the next.      Achieving more autonomous capabilities will
require the development of a software framework that is able to
effectively and efficiently process electro-optical and possibly
multi-modal sensor data to identify, observe, and focus on regions or
objects of interest within complex scenes.  This framework will need to
understand the task objectives and the context of situations as they
arise to intelligently select what and where to focus its attention
without losing situational awareness.  It must be able to detect the
temporal continuity of perceived objects despite motion of the sensor
suite and\/or motion of objects in the world, and will need to be able
to predict the motion of objects to anticipate where to look and account
 for occlusion or discontinuities within an image sequence.    PHASE I:
Develop a conceptual design for a framework for an attention-based
vision system that is capable of efficiently processing multi-modal
sensor data to identify, observe, and focus on objects or regions of
interest within complex scenes and deliver a report on the desired
approach for development in Phase II.  The Phase I report will include:
development of the reference model architecture and performance
specification and prediction for an attention-based vision framework
and, the analysis of the potential component technologies to populate
this framework using sensor data captured from the ONR 30 autonomous
ground vehicle test-beds.  Sensor data may include Red-Green-Blue (RGB)
and Long wave infrared (LWIR) images and associated stereo disparity as
well as automotive Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and Radio
Detection and Ranging (RADAR).  Phase I option, if awarded, could
address preparation for building the prototype in Phase II.    PHASE II:
 Prototype an attention-based vision framework based on reference model
and performance specification defined in Phase I.  This prototype
framework will be loosely integrated into the ONR 30 Autonomy baseline
system architecture to facilitate the rapid assessment of candidate
solutions and evaluation of component technologies.  At the conclusion
of Phase II, the prototype solution will be demonstrated on ONR 30
autonomous ground vehicle test-beds to validate the performance in a
relevant environment.    PHASE III: Conduct the system engineering to
fully integrate candidate solution with the ONR 30 Autonomy test-bed
platforms and associated system architecture (or other equivalent
autonomous system) and conduct the optimization of component algorithms.
  Conduct full system demonstration in a relevant environment and if
successful transition to future desired RSJPO Program of
Records"Autonomous Mobility Applique System"or"Common Robotics

 considered for transition into the ONR 30 Core Autonomy portfolio for
maturation to TRL 6.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE
APPLICATIONS: Farming and Mining industries continue to advance and
leverage unmanned and autonomous systems for recurring tasks in
relatively controlled environments.  As these capabilities grow, safety
will become more of a concern and the ability to identify, observe, and
track objects in the environment will reduce risk of injury or accident.
  The automotive industry continues to significantly reduce cost of
sensors through widespread integration onto new vehicles for safety and
automation such as rear warning sensors, adaptive cruise control, and
automated parking.  As the industry moves toward driverless cars in the
next 5 years or so, safety and increased ability to sense and perceive
the environment through low cost sensors will be of paramount

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a stereo imaging passive
terrain mapping system explicitly for use in low-light conditions using
low-resolution, low cost, and low signal-to-noise sensors.
DESCRIPTION: Terrain sensing and mapping based on stereo imagery,
whether from single or multiple cameras, generally relies on having good
 signal-to-noise characteristics.  Military operations necessitate that
terrain sensing systems operate primarily at night under low-light
conditions where image intensifiers (I2) or infrared (IR) sensors are
generally limited to low resolution, low signal-to-noise, or both.  This
 has resulted in the majority of terrain sensing systems now being
active (emitting), such as millimeter-wave radar, scanning Laser
Detection and Ranging (LADAR), or flash LADAR, all of which pose a
signature risk in threat environments.  This effort would explore the
limits of passive terrain sensing and mapping under low-light conditions
 using sensors such as I2, fused Electro-optical-infrared (EO-IR) or
some alternative, preferably low cost solution.  This effort will also
stress the limits of machine vision ranging algorithms in low
signal-to-noise environments.  Terrain and obstacles likely to be
encountered by a helicopter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in both rural
and urban settings should be emphasized; e.g., hills, trees, water,
buildings, towers, wires, etc.    PHASE I: Perform and document a
tradeoff analysis of existing sensors for range, field-of-view,
resolution, frame rate, weight, and power.  Identify design points
within the study appropriate to micro, small and full-scale helicopter
UAVs, i.e., system weight equal to approximately 0.25 lb, 2.5 lb, and 25
 lb, respectively.  A horizontal and vertical field-of-view of 60
degrees is desirable.  Identify and design a concept using the low-light
 sensors coupled with machine vision algorithms.  Demonstrate a
breadboard implementation of the resulting design that can produce
accurate real-time terrain data.    PHASE II: Using results of the Phase
 I effort, build a prototype system and demonstrate it on a helicopter
UAV provided as Government-furnished equipment.  This prototype
demonstration and validation will be achieved by working closely with
Government researchers to integrate the sensor.    PHASE III: Upon
successful results at the end of Phase II, the company will be expected
to support the Navy in continuing the transition of the developed
low-light terrain sensing technology.  The business will produce a
sensor system for evaluation to determine its effectiveness in an
operationally relevant environment and will provide support for test and
 validation to certify and qualify the new technology in navy systems.
Other potential applications include the ONR AACUS program and Army
Autonomous Technologies for Unmanned Air Systems (ATUAS) program.  These
 programs seek to expand the operations of future autonomous helicopters
 including operations in complex, cluttered environments.    PRIVATE
SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: This system could be
 used in a broad range of helicopter UAV missions requiring autonomous
operations in complex urban environments.  In addition, manned
helicopters operating in the same environment could benefit from such a

Warfare Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) using Game Theory",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: This SBIR topic proposes the use of
game theoretic modeling to quantify the contribution of information
related capabilities (Computer Network Attack (CNA), Computer Network
Exploitation (CNE), and Electronic Attack (EA)) to the warfighting
outcome.  The model should enable comparative analysis between
information related capabilities and traditional kinetic fires
(artillery, mortars, &amp; close air support) during mission planning.
  DESCRIPTION: Future Marine Corps Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF)
operations will be characterized by smaller, more agile units operating
in a distributed environment facing a broad array of friendly and enemy
networked communication and computer-based systems.  To be effective in
this complex battlespace, Marines at all echelons will be required to
leverage technology to create a collaborative environment to coordinate
ground and airborne non-kinetic capabilities, synchronized with
traditional fires.  To adequately integrate these fires, metrics are
required to make trade-offs between Cyber\/EW systems and air and ground
 weapons systems.  The purpose of this research is to develop a
methodology based on game theoretical models to quantify the value of
cyber exploits and electronic attack within the context of relevant
mission threads to rapidly inform decisions made on the battlefield.
PHASE I: Conduct a full factorial design of experiment (DOE) to identify
 input variables and response variables that adequately describe the
cyber terrain for full spectrum MAGTF operations.  Using those input
variables and response variables, create a game theoretic framework for
tactical decision making that can assess the relative value of Cyber\/EW
 applications to the warfighting outcome.  Researchers should reference
the 2012 paper by Schramm, Alderson, Carlyle, and Dmitrov to guide their
 work.  The deliverable for this phase is an academic paper detailing
the results of the DOE and how those inputs and response variables are
integrated into the development of the game theoretic model.   This work
 will be at the UNCLASS level.    PHASE II: During Phase II, the
research team will conduct a validation and verification (V &amp; V) of
the model developed in Phase I using three relevant tactical mission
thread provided by the principle investigator.  The deliverable for this
 phase is a detailed report on the V &amp; V process and an explanation
of any model modifications that were required based on the testing.
This work will be classified at the TS\/\/SI\/\/NOFORN level.    PHASE
III: Apply the game theoretic model validated in Phase II during a field
 test of the products developed for the FNT 13-03 FNC.  The model should
 enable pre-mission Cyber\/EW arsenal assessment and real-time tactical
decision-making based on emerging threats detected in the
Electromagnetic Environment (EME).  The deliverable for this phase is a
detailed assessment of the FNC based on the output from the game
theoretic framework recorded during testing.  The report should also
include a methodology to apply game theory to both the Marine Corps
Planning Process (MCPP) and decisions made within the Cyber\/Electronic
Warfare Coordination Cell (CEWCC) during tactical operations. This work
will be classified at the TS\/\/SI\/\/NOFORN level.    PRIVATE SECTOR
COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: The methodologies developed
 in this SBIR topic will enable warfighters to populate and select
Cyber\/EW applications from an application mall within a tactical cloud
architecture.  The game theoretic framework will enable rapid
comparative analysis between available applications required for
specific mission sets. Currently, the private sector is quickly moving
towards the usage of cloud architectures to increase collaboration.
This type of collaboration and rapid assessment will be very useful for
the MAGTF to conduct cyberspace operations at the tactical edge.",

for RF Networking",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: A Spatial Multiplexer will enable
Spatially Divided Multiple Access (SDMA) transmit-receive paired nodes
to correlate half-rate sub-streams dynamically, facilitating flexible
channel modulation across up to 4 wideband High Frequencey (HF), 4
wideband Very High Frequencey (VHF) or 4 wideband Ultra High Frequency
(UHF) radio pathways. This advancement in RF Network transport of
TCP\/IP will enable spatial filtering between transmit\/receive pairs so
 that each SDMA which is also known as Multiple Inputs\/Multiple Outputs
 for Multiple User (MIMO-MU) can nodally each have dynamically layered
delivery options.    DESCRIPTION: Present designs of BFTN are
underutilizing the power of"wireless"networking using multiple
transmitters and receivers to establish meshed high-bandwidth TCP\/IP
communications (Collegiately referred to as MIMO-MU) in an Anti-Acess
Area Denial (A2AD) or Satellite Communication (SATCOM) denied event.
These events are predicted to last as many as 9 months without abatement
 and can significant impinge warfighter operations until BFTN is
enhanced to advantage the user with the high-bandwidth they need. A
principal challenge with these high-bandwidth RF Network layers is to
dynamically route IP data traffic across a number of RF communication
pathways that are"sub-netted"to allow hopping from one transport path to
 another and still retain TCP delivery verifications.  The MLSM project
endeavors to build upon academic research work conceptually architecting
 spatial combining and reuse of RF channels in order to layer RF
Networks into cohesive multi-node MIMO-MU wireless delivery systems. The
 endeavor will assert testable design criteria to this cognitive
research and establish design limitations commensurate to MIMO-MU
Networking over RF; to produce a common routable topology across
multiple sub-networks within the technical and operational requirements
of US Navy Fleet operations.  As the result of this project, MLSM will
be tested and demonstrated in a test bed environment that closely mimics
 a Navy trial program such as the Fleet Experiments (FLEX) or similar
Program of Record funded evaluations. If successful, the MLSM will
enable expedited implementation of the BFTN(e) capability to the US Navy
 Fleet and assure their TCP\/IP inter-networked communication even in
the most stringent Radio jammed environments.    PHASE I: The offering
company or organization will design a common approach to multiplex and
load balance TCP\/IP traffic across eight RF Networking circuits based
on Exhibit 1: Concept Diagram for Spatial Multiplexing eight (8)
channels of HF\/UHF\/VHF. This exhibit can be viewed on the SITIS
website for the duration of the solicitation opening. As a Phase I
deliverable, a scientific and technical report will be required that
will fully document how the design will be constructed, as well as,
contain sufficient underpinning research, both direct and indirect, to
authenticate the achieved performance results of such a design.
Exhibit 1: Concept Diagram for Spatial Multiplexing 8 channels of
HF\/UHF\/VHF    PHASE II: Utilizing design from Phase I effort, develop a
 bench-top prototype that would be used to validate required performance
 in a laboratory environment. A Program of Record sponsored field trial
will authenticated the performance levels postulated during Phase I and
demonstrated during the Benchtop test. Phase II deliverables, over and
above the required monthly status\/progress reports and the final
report, will include the following, as a minimum:   1) Complete
preliminary and final prototype design documents\/drawings to the system
 and subsystem level.  2) A preliminary design review (PDR) and critical
 design review (CDR), and all supporting documentation for these
reviews, will be provided to government stakeholders at the 50 and 75
percent point of the base effort. A Technology Readiness Review (TRR)
and all supporting documentation for this review, will be provided to
government stakeholders at the 50 percent point of the option effort, if
 awarded.  3) Formal test procedures and test plans with subsequent test
 inspection\/reports authenticating the achieved performance results of
the prototype design.  4) Preliminary demonstration of bench-top
prototype design will be required within the last 30 days of the base
effort, and if option effort is awarded, a fully operational
demonstration will be required no later than the end of the option
period. Each demonstration will consist of spatial multiplexing,
load-balancing and re-routing performance levels in a laboratory
emulation of three at-sea Carrier Strike Groups with simultaneously
inter-operating RF Networks.  5) Bench-top prototype must be delivered
to the government at the completion of the base effort, if option is not
 awarded. If option is awarded, prototype will be retained by company
for further refinement and testing, and re-delivered to the government
at the end of the option period.    PHASE III: Transition of this work
effort to full production under the BFTN Program of Record (POR) will be
 accomplished once the MLSM design is validated and interface
requirement documentation is approved for installation.
Productionization of the solution will commence once installation
handbooks and user maintenance manuals are completed and accepted by the
 SPAWAR Integrated Logistics System (ILS) organization.    PRIVATE

Thermal Protection System (TPS) is used on the outer surface of the body
 to control ablation and minimize the amount of heat transmitted to the
underlying structure.  Current Navy TPS technology is based on the
family of char-forming carbon\/phenolic (C\/Ph) materials and was

 TPS are deployed in Submarine Launched Missile Systems and cost, weight
 effectiveness are the primary performance metrics.  However, proposed

Carbon-Carbon Composite Components",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop improved non-linear
materials behavior models for the design of Carbon\/Carbon thermal
protection components.    DESCRIPTION: Thermal protection systems (TPS)
for current and future Navy hypersonic reentry bodies include flight
critical components fabricated from 2D and 3D woven carbon-carbon (C\/C)
 composite materials.  TPS component designs are validated by Finite
Element Analysis (FEA) during pre-flight Preliminary and Critical Design
 Reviews (PDR &amp; CDR).  These C\/C materials are orthotropic in
nature and exhibit extreme non-linear behavior across a very wide
temperature range of 70-5000F, and above.  Use of linear elastic
behavior models results in over prediction of material stress state, and
 possibly over conservative designs. Efficient design with these
materials requires that onset and development of material non-linearity
be accounted for.  For 3D C\/C, this has historically been accomplished
by use of a material behavior model (UMAT) that enables the FEA code to
calculate the material stress\/strain at all points within the component
 at discrete points during reentry.  While the UMAT model is relevant to
 3D C\/C composites in general, the utilization in a reentry environment
 requires applicability to problems with distributed external pressure
loads, and severe transient thermal loads.  Damage and non-linearity are
 primarily driven by these transient thermal loads.    The UMAT material
 model contains coefficients derived from characterization tests.
Historically, this was not a concern as the C\/C material was derived
from constituent materials with a stable manufacturing base; the
composite material was well characterized and much data was available by
 which these coefficients were obtained.  However, this is no longer the
 case; fibers and matrix materials become obsolete almost as soon as
they are selected, and pre-flight PDR\/CDR design validation for current
 generation TPS materials is often required before full characterization
 data and material model coefficients become available.  Furthermore,
output of the material model is limited to stress\/strain state and
gives no indication as to the onset or extent of non-linearity (damage)
within the material or critical failure mode within the cell structure
of the material.     This topic seeks to take advantage of recent
improvements in computational power\/resources in developing
new\/improved methods for thermo-mechanical design validation of
new\/emerging 2D and 3D C\/C TPS components.      PHASE I: Conceptualize
 approach for improved design methodology for non-linear FEA of 2D and
3D C\/C.  Evaluate methods which take into account onset and development
 of material non-linearity under transient and multi-directional
thermo-mechanical stress state developed during reentry.  Evaluate
methods at to provision of insight into onset and evolution of damage,
and dominant failure mode.  Evaluate methods which can automate or ease
the development of material coefficients from limited new data sets from
 candidate replacement materials.  Methods which integrate with the
commercial ABAQUS finite element method are preferred.  Evaluate
preliminary approach and perform partial functionality using current
materials\/test data.  Define criteria for Phase II success.    PHASE

composite materials have many potential uses in space, air transport,
and automotive applications.  Improved methods for design validation of
these materials would be very attractive.  Examples include: Missile

 for Mental Health Research and Practice",
        "description": "\n\tResearch Objectives\n\n\tThe overarching
goal of the SBIR program at the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH) is to support small businesses to develop technologies that can
advance the mission of the Institute, including in basic neuroscience
research relevant to mental disorders, translational and clinical
research of mental disorders, clinical diagnosis or treatment of mental
disorders, and dissemination of evidence-based mental health
care.&amp;nbsp; The NIMH Strategic Plan
(http:\/\/www.nimh.nih.gov\/about\/strategic-planning-reports\/index.shtml)
 presents key scientific priorities across these domains, and describes
the need for tools to realize these priorities. Research priorities for
the NIMH further include aspects of HIV\/AIDS prevention, treatment, and
 care, in accordance with the Trans-NIH Plan for HIV-Related Research
(http:\/\/www.oar.nih.gov\/strategicplan\/).\n\n\tThe SBIR program is
one source of support for the research and development of technologies
that correspond to these identified research priorities.&amp;nbsp; While
 some tools can be developed with budgets and project durations within
the standard SBIR guidelines, others cannot.&amp;nbsp; This FOA
encourages SBIR applications for support of research and development of
particular types of technologies that require funding levels and
durations beyond those reflected in the standard SBIR
guidelines.&amp;nbsp; For additional tools in which NIMH is interested,
but which can be supported within the standard SBIR guidelines, see the
NIMH-related topics of the SBIR Omnibus Solicitation -
PAR-11-096.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tApplications submitted in response to this
FOA are expected to represent significant advances and
innovation.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tSpecific Areas of Research
Interest:\n\n\tBiomarkers and Biosignatures of Mental
Illness:\n\n\tBiomarkers are objective, measurable biochemical, genetic,
 or other biological indicators of a physiological or disease process.
While some individual biomarkers are useful in biomedicine, complex
conditions such as mental illness (including HIV-related neurological
and neuropsychiatric impairment) might benefit from constellations of
several different biomarkers being considered together (i.e.,
biosignatures). Whether used alone or in conjunction with others,
biomarkers could facilitate definitive diagnosis of mental disorders in
individuals, assess the susceptibility of individuals to a particular
disorder, indicate changes in the severity of a disorder, show the
response of a disorder to a given treatment, or the likely
responsiveness of a particular patient to a given intervention.
Biomarkers and biosignatures would have clear and significant clinical
benefit, and are urgently needed.&amp;nbsp; NIMH is specifically
interested in supporting the development of clinically applied
indicators as well as those useful in basic brain or behavioral
research. Ideally, these would be noninvasively obtained (e.g., using
optical or magnetic resonance imaging, etc.), or obtained with minimal
invasiveness (e.g., from body fluids using genetic, protein or metabolic
 signatures, physiological measures, etc.).&amp;nbsp; Specific examples
of clinical applications include: reliable and stable biomarkers that
can identify at-risk individuals prior to disease onset, biological and
behavioral indicators of treatment response, measures of disease
progression, to identify dose ranges prior to clinical studies, to
define patients to enroll in the clinical study, to identifying CNS
abnormalities, etc.&amp;nbsp; Specific examples of basic research
applications: indicators that enable refined assessment of normal and
atypical infant, child and adolescent brain development and brain
function, biomarkers for assessing changes in specific mental functions
over the lifespan. Either human subjects or relevant animal models would
 be appropriate to use in basic research applications. It is important
to note that these examples are merely illustrative and are not meant to
 limit the scope of appropriate applications.\n\n\tDrug Discovery\/Drug
Development in Mental Illness:\n\n\tThrough the SBIR program, NIMH
continues to support the development of pharmacologic agents that target
 novel molecular entities, relevant to mental health disorders, or
domains of function (e.g. cognitive function).&amp;nbsp; In the last
decade, only a relatively small number of drugs have been approved for
the treatment of mental health disorders, and most were chemically based
 on older marketed compounds.&amp;nbsp; In addition, none specifically
targeted neurodevelopmental epochs at which a mental health
disorder&amp;rsquo;s symptoms may begin to appear.&amp;nbsp; The lack of
 such compounds not only may be limiting the utility of such
interventions for pediatric populations, but may also be missing a key
juncture at which intervention might have particularly long-term
benefits.&amp;nbsp; NIMH is specifically interested in supporting the
development of pharmacologic agents, based on novel molecular CNS
targets that improve function and minimize the side effects seen with
current medications. In addition, compounds targeted for the treatment
of pediatric mental health disorders would also be of
interest.&amp;nbsp; SBIR support in drug discovery\/development is broad
 and ranges from the development of novel ligand screening assays (such
as computational, high throughput, genetic, molecular\/cellular, or
whole animal) to novel chemistry approaches, to lead compound
identification\/optimization preclinical efficacy, IND-enabling studies,
 and up to FDA Phase I and II clinical trials.&amp;nbsp; Novel clinical
trial designs\/approaches would also be applicable, if well
justified.\n\n\tAn additional focus in this area is the support of
technologies that would enable researchers to selectively screen for
compounds with high selectivity to Central Nervous System (CNS)-located
G-protein coupled receptor proteins (GPCRs).&amp;nbsp; Many of the GPCRs
 have potential significance in healthy mental function and in mental
disorders, including receptors for serotonin, glutamate, dopamine,
opioids, GABA, orexins, somatostatin, muscarinic, cannabinoid,
adrenergic, Neuropeptide Y, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and
others.&amp;nbsp; Drugs targeting GPCRs are currently used in the
treatment of mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety and
depression.&amp;nbsp; Yet identification or synthesis of selective
agonists and antagonists to these particular receptor subtypes has
proved daunting, due to the current lack of knowledge about the three
dimensional (3-D) structure of many of these receptors, and their
diffuse brain distribution. , Therefore, this FOA encourages the
development of technologies to aid in the identification of their 3-D
structures or in some other way, enable researchers to selectively
screen for compounds with high selectivity to the receptor (and minimize
 side effects). Technologies and approaches aimed at either known
receptor subtypes or orphan receptors would be of potential
interest.\n\n\tTherapeutics Development for HIV\/AIDS-Associated
Neuropsychological Disorders:\n\n\tThe NIMH Division of AIDS Research
(DAR) encourages SBIR applications targeting the discovery and
development of novel therapeutic agents, methods, biomarkers, and drug
delivery technologies that can address the neurological implications of
HIV infection and seek to directly or indirectly eliminate\/eradicate
HIV reservoirs in the brain.&amp;nbsp; The overriding focus is upon the
development of adjunctive therapies against the consequences of HIV in
the central nervous system, but novel assays\/models of neurotoxicity
and treatment efficacy measures are also invited, as well as novel in
vitro\/vivo models that can be used for screening potential therapeutic
agents.\n\n\tDevelopment of PET and SPECT Ligands for Brain
Imaging:&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThis topic is intended to stimulate the
development of radioligands for CNS- relevant molecular targets (e.g.,
receptors, cell adhesion molecules, intracellular messengers, and
disease related proteins) that are of interest to the mental health
scientific community. The widespread availability and use of these
radioligands are expected to: 1) accelerate research on identifying and
characterizing the neural circuits and pathways implicated in the
pathophysiology of psychiatric brain disorders and HIV-associated
neurological and neuropsychiatric impairment, and 2) facilitate the
identification of new therapeutic targets and the development of new
compounds as potential therapeutic agents.&amp;nbsp; Research support
under this topic includes: lead compound identification, preclinical
studies, IND-enabling studies, pilot human imaging studies in normal
volunteers and clinical studies in psychiatric populations.\n\n\tTools
to Facilitate Mental Health Research:\n\n\tThe complexity of conducting
and managing mental health research is significant due to the diverse
technologies\/methodologies currently being used, difficulty in the
recruitment of subjects, broad categorical diagnoses of disorders,
unique cultural and developmental aspects of a disorder, etc.&amp;nbsp;
Therefore, the NIMH seeks the development of innovative
technologies\/strategies to help mitigate some of these
issues.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExamples could include&amp;nbsp; one or more of
the following: technologies to improve clinical research recruitment,
patient and doctor compliance, clinical trial design or implementation;
the application of technology to enhance the science, operation, and
management of large or multi-site mental health or HIV\/AIDS clinical
trials; the development of innovative computer-based observation
techniques, and computer software and hardware that facilitate
screening, assessment and monitoring during clinical trials; the
development of portable clinical trial management systems such as
serious adverse event (SAE) oversight and monitoring software; advanced
methods to visualize complex clinical and biological data; development
of real time risk assessments or a clinical tool that enables clinicians
 to quickly recognize a change in patient health and therefore improve
clinical care.\n\n\tThe NIMH is also supportive of the development and
implementation of robust rapidly scalable data systems that can safely
and efficiently import and house core data from multiple independent
sources (i.e. large health care providers) and from different hardware
platforms. Such systems would effectively categorize, merge and
aggregate data from multiple independent sources and would utilize a
core data element structure. This system would enable researchers to
easily access the system, identify potential research subjects, analyze
clinical data, produce reports and &amp;ldquo;data
mine.&amp;rdquo;\n\n\tTools\/Platforms to Improve the Dissemination and
Implementation of Evidence-Based Mental Health
Interventions:\n\n\tClinical mental health research produces a vast
amount of information that should be informative to mental health care
providers, yet there are no easy ways for this information to be
transformed into standard clinical practice.&amp;nbsp; Similar concerns
have been noted with regard to advancing the uptake and sound
implementation of efficacious HIV prevention and care interventions by
HIV providers, clinics, and community-based organizations.\n\n\tThe NIMH
 supports the development of innovative user-friendly tools and
platforms to efficiently and effectively disseminate evidence-based
treatments\/research into services and clinical practice. Such tools may
 incorporate applied behavioral science and technology, software,
hardware and associated technologies. The focus of the information being
 disseminated might include: the development of strategies or tools to
assist mental health care providers in detecting and monitoring mental
illness progression, in implementing proven interventions, or in
predicting treatment response and vulnerability to side effects of
psychotropic medications.&amp;nbsp; Systems may also seek to advance the
 identification, dissemination, adoption, or effective implementation of
 evidence-based behavioral interventions for HIV prevention and
care.\n\n\tAdditional NIMH interests include the development of
geographic based systems (GIS) that can identify disparities in mental
health treatment and demonstrate the impact of the effective
dissemination of proven mental health treatments across and within
geographic areas. The NIMH holds further interests in data translation
and communication packages for collecting, archiving, and safely and
securely making available existing mental health and HIV\/AIDS data sets
 to the scientific community for secondary or meta-analyses.&amp;nbsp;
It is expected that the dissemination platform be state of the art,
considering the latest electronic technologies, so as not to develop a
tool that becomes obsolete during the commercialization phase.&amp;nbsp;
 In addition, dissemination of interventions that have not been
well-validated would not be appropriate for
commercialization.\n\n\tProbes and Instrumentation for Monitoring and
Manipulating Nervous System Plasticity and
Development:&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tMental disorders are increasingly seen as
developmental disorders.&amp;nbsp; The potential to harness
neuroplasticity -- to enhance the ability of the nervous system to
reshape and form new connections -- may be the basis for therapeutic
approaches to disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder, and
cognitive impairment. Thus, understanding neural development and
plasticity at all levels, from molecules and cells to circuits and
behavior, has broad implications for mental health.&amp;nbsp; The NIMH
SBIR program continues to support the development of tools or techniques
 that will significantly advance the current state of the art in
neuroplasticity research. Although applications will not be restricted
to developing a particular type of technology, we are especially
interested in applications that seek to harness the ability to assess
and manipulate activity with exquisite subcellular resolution, and in
cells specified by their circuit connectivity and\/or transmitter
phenotype.&amp;nbsp; Examples include: new or enhanced reporters of
neural activity, novel tools for manipulating neural circuits, and
improved imaging equipment.\n\n\tComputational Tools for Research in
Neuroscience, Behavioral Science and Mental Health:&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe
NIMH has a longstanding interest in developing and seizing the promise
that digital approaches hold for brain and behavioral research, and for
advancing the understanding, prevention, and treatment of mental
disorders. In accord with that interest, grant applications are sought
from small businesses that propose to develop and validate novel,
commercializable, computational tools and resources that will aid
neuroscientists, mental health researchers, or mental health providers
in their research or practice.&amp;nbsp; Examples of appropriate
applications range from computational models for drug discovery in
mental health disorders or HIV-associated CNS disorders, to ones that
combine genetic, biological, behavioral and environmental factors to
assess pediatric vulnerability to mental disorders, to methods to
enhance efficiency of early phase clinical trials.&amp;nbsp; These
examples are not meant to be exclusive.\n\n\tHigh Throughput Tools for
Neuroscience and Mental Health Research:&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tMany of the
common technologies used in neuroscience and behavioral science research
 require extensive time, labor, and cost for acquiring and analyzing
data.&amp;nbsp; With many significant advances in technical areas
including computer vision, molecular biology, robotics, nanotechnology,
microarray fabrication, imaging, etc. occurring over the last decade,
combined with discoveries in neurobiology, a unique opportunity is
available to bring these technology and biomedical areas together to
develop innovative high throughput tools relevant to brain and\/or
behavior.&amp;nbsp; Applications considered appropriate to this topic
would include those proposing research and development of tools for high
 throughput measures at any level (or combination of levels) of
analysis: from genes and molecules through behavior, including cognition
 and social behavior. The tools would, of course, need to be aimed at
rapid acquisition and analysis of data, such as the collection of CNS
physiological data from multiple subjects at one time. While the range
of measures by tools is wide, appropriate applications must propose
research and development of tools that would significantly improve the
ability to rapidly acquire data from multiple experiments
simultaneously, and rapidly analyze the collected
data.\n\n\tNanotechnologies for Neuroscience and Mental Health
Research:&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tNanotechnologies are showing promise in diverse
 roles highly relevant to NIMH priorities.&amp;nbsp; In particular, NIMH
 is interested in nanotechnologies that focus on a variety of
technologies including:&amp;nbsp; the development of extended release
formulations of psychiatric drugs, biomarker assays, probes for
microimaging, in vitro assays to study neuronal function, and assays to
allow GPCR function to be studied.&amp;nbsp; NIMH is further interested
in nanotechnology to address HIV-associated neurological and
neuropsychiatric impairment, particularly with regard to the delivery of
 antiretroviral medications or neuroprotective compounds across the
blood-brain barrier.\n\n\tAn additional criteria that the federal
government considers in supporting a small business with SBIR funds, is
past commercialization performance.&amp;nbsp; It is expected that small
businesses who have received many SBIR grants, have made significant
effort to commercialize their previously supported
technologies.&amp;nbsp; Small businesses that are mostly interested in
research and development (and not commercialization) should consider
other grant mechanisms at NIH, rather than the SBIR program.&amp;nbsp;
Program staff at NIMH can help identify the most appropriate grant
mechanism to use.&amp;nbsp; \n\n\tAdditional information about NIMH

invest a significant amount of funds in the development of new
technologies to study the brain and behavior, from basic and clinical
perspectives, through a variety of mechanisms, including, from NIH, the
R01, R21, R33, P01, P41, and P50 grants. This investment has produced a
large number of technologies that include hardware (e.g., instruments,
devices, etc.), software (e.g., computational models, informatics tools,
 data analytic methods, etc.) and wetware (e.g., cell-free assays,
bioactive agents, imaging probes, etc.). While these technologies are
put to good use by their developers, such non-commercial developers
devote little attention to making their tools robust and easy to use by

        "description": "\n\tPurpose\n\n\tThe purpose of this funding
opportunity is to reduce health disparities through the development and
translation of appropriate medical technologies.&amp;nbsp; The NIH
defines health disparities as differences in the incidence, prevalence,
morbidity, mortality, and burden of diseases and other adverse health
outcomes that exist among specific population groups.&amp;nbsp; These
population groups include racial and ethnic minorities (African
Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Hispanic
Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other U.S. Pacific Islanders,
subpopulations of all of these racial\/ethnic groups), socioeconomically
 disadvantaged individuals, and medically underserved populations
including individuals residing in rural and urban areas.&amp;nbsp;
Appropriate medical technologies must have the following basic
characteristics: effective, affordable, culturally acceptable, and
easily accessible to those who need them.&amp;nbsp; Responsive grant
applications must involve a formal collaboration with a healthcare
provider or other healthcare organization serving one or more health
disparity populations during Phase I and Phase II. &amp;nbsp; This
announcement supports applications to develop medical devices, imaging
systems, and other technologies that adequately address the healthcare
needs of health disparity populations.&amp;nbsp; It is expected that
responsive grant applications will result in advances in medical
technologies that will be invaluable in reducing health disparities
within and across the priority areas of cardiovascular disease, stroke,
cancer, diabetes, HIV\/AIDS, infant mortality, mental health, and
obesity, as well as lung, liver, and kidney diseases, psoriasis,
scleroderma, and other diseases, illnesses, and conditions of public
health importance.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tMedical and scientific advances
have introduced new opportunities for the continued improvement of
health for all Americans. However, in spite of notable improvements
gained as a result of the technological advancement, there continues to
be an alarming disproportionate burden of illness among minority and
other health disparity populations.&amp;nbsp; Overcoming persistent
disparities in healthcare access and health outcomes remains a foremost
challenge. To meet this challenge, the NIH is committed to supporting a
wide range of research, aimed at the development of innovative
diagnostics, treatments, and preventative strategies to reduce, and
eventually eliminate, health disparities.\n\n\tResearch Objectives and
Scope\n\n\tThe primary objective of this funding opportunity is to
support the translation of medical technologies, new or existing, that
can have a significant impact on healthcare access and health outcomes
for health disparity populations.&amp;nbsp; Small business concerns
(SBCs) are invited to submit grant applications proposing to develop and
 deliver appropriate technologies to health disparity
populations.&amp;nbsp; Responsive grant applications must involve a
formal collaboration with a healthcare provider or other healthcare
organization serving one or more health disparity populations during
Phase I and Phase II. A requisite component of the research plan is a
description of the healthcare requirements and needs of the population
and the existing barriers to adequate healthcare delivery. Several of
these barriers have been identified and are described below.
Applications submitted to this funding opportunity must address one or
more of these barriers in developing technologies that will impact
health disparities:\n\n\t\n\t\tPhysical Barriers&amp;mdash;factors such
as proximity to healthcare facilities and transportation may limit
access to healthcare\n\t\n\t\tKnowledge Barriers&amp;mdash;health
literacy and language barriers can inhibit healthcare delivery, as well
as a lack of patient information for the healthcare
provider\n\t\n\t\tInfrastructure Barriers&amp;mdash;rural hospitals and
community health centers may not have the same resources and expertise
of large hospitals, and may not be able to afford advanced medical
technologies\n\t\n\t\tEconomic Barriers&amp;mdash;lack of insurance
coverage or financial resources may also contribute to disparities in
healthcare access\n\t\n\t\tCultural Barriers&amp;mdash;religious beliefs
 and social customs often deter certain populations from seeking
healthcare\n\n\n\tAppropriate technologies may be new and innovative, or
 they may be existing technologies that have been redesigned based on
the needs of a specific health disparity population.&amp;nbsp;
Appropriate technologies have been defined as effective, affordable,
culturally acceptable, and deliverable to those who need them. To be
effective, a technology must provide an improvement over the current
quality of care for a health disparity population by overcoming one or
more of the barriers. The technology must also be low-cost, so as to be
affordable to the local hospital, community health center, primary care
physician, or individual patient in need.&amp;nbsp; For a medical
technology to be adopted by a health disparity population, the
technology development must be amenable to the population&amp;rsquo;s
cultural beliefs and social customs.&amp;nbsp; Acceptance of the
technology by the population is critical to the successful delivery of
quality healthcare.&amp;nbsp; To be physically delivered to those in
need, a technology must be developed within the specifications of the
operating environment of the end-user.&amp;nbsp; The technology must be
able to function given the existing resources and expertise within
health disparity populations. Keeping in mind the barriers that
contribute to health disparities, a non-inclusive list of appropriate
medical technologies that might achieve the objectives of this
initiative may be found below:\n\n\t\n\t\tTelehealth technologies for
remote diagnosis and monitoring\n\t\n\t\tSensors for point-of-care
diagnosis\n\t\n\t\tDevices for in-home monitoring\n\t\n\t\tMobile,
portable diagnostic and therapeutic systems\n\t\n\t\tDevices which
integrate diagnosis and treatment\n\t\n\t\tDiagnostics or treatments
that do not require special training\n\t\n\t\tDevices that can operate
in low-resource environments\n\t\n\t\tNon-invasive technologies for
diagnosis and treatment\n\t\n\t\tIntegrated, automated system to assess
or monitor a specific condition\n\t\n\t\tSome examples include, but are
not limited to\n\t\n\t\tInexpensive diabetic test strip and\/or blood
sugar monitoring.&amp;nbsp; With the growing obesity epidemic and the
growing incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes, health disparity
communities struggle with diabetes and its many sequelae (#1 cause of
blindness, dialysis, and amputations).\n\t\n\t\tUse of currently
available basic technology (e.g. phone lines, televisions with remote
controls, cellphones, weight scales, diabetic glucometers, thermometers)
 within underserved settings to promote self-management and patient
education, increase patient-clinician communication and surveillance of
chronic disease conditions.\n\t\n\t\tTelemedicine to improve access to
specialty care which would normally not be accessible because of high
cost and transportation.&amp;nbsp; This would also link up academic
tertiary-oriented health centers with community-based primary care
homes.\n\t\n\t\tImproved early detection (via saliva testing, breath
testing, blood testing) of diseases where there are significant health
disparities.\n\t\n\t\tLow-cost portable imaging for prevention and early
 detection of conditions where there are significant health disparities
(e.g. breast cancer screening and portable retinal imaging).\n\n",

        "description": "\n\tPurpose\n\n\tThe National Human Genome
Research Institute (NHGRI) solicits R43\/R44 grant applications to
develop novel technologies that will enable extremely low-cost, high
quality DNA sequencing.&amp;nbsp; This FOA continues a program that
began in 2004, when the cost to produce a high quality draft mammalian
genome sequence was estimated at $5 to $10 million, and the goal was to
reduce costs by four orders of magnitude &amp;ndash; to approximately
$1,000 &amp;ndash; in ten years.\n\n\tWhile substantial progress toward
the $1,000 genome has been made, daunting scientific and technical
challenges remain. This program will continue to support both
fundamental scientific investigation underlying the technologies, and
their engineering, to achieve this goal. &amp;nbsp;The program supports
development of key system components and of full systems. &amp;nbsp;In
this context, &amp;lsquo;key components&amp;rsquo; refers to the method
for determining the linear order of nucleotides, in contrast to upstream
 or downstream steps in sequencing. &amp;nbsp;Exploration of methods
other than those currently being pursued as potential $1,000 genome
technologies is encouraged. &amp;nbsp;High-risk\/high-payoff
applications are appropriate to achieve the goals of this
FOA.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tThe ability to sequence complete genomes and
the free dissemination of sequence data have dramatically changed the
nature of biological and biomedical research. &amp;nbsp;Sequence and
other genomic data have the potential to lead to remarkable improvement
in many facets of human life and society, including the understanding,
diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease; advances in agriculture,
 environmental science and remediation; and our understanding of
evolution and ecological systems.\n\n\tThe ability to sequence many
genomes completely has been made possible by the enormous reduction of
the cost of sequencing in the past 30 years, from tens of dollars per
base in the 1980s to a fraction of a cent per base today. &amp;nbsp;We
have progressed from the early Human Genome Project goals to sequence
the genomes of the human and mouse and a few additional model organisms
(E. coli, C. elegans and D. melanogaster), through programs to sequence
at varying pre-determined quality levels numerous genomes across the
evolutionary tree including multiple species and variants for some of
those, to current programs to sequence portions or the entire genomes of
 increasing numbers of tumors and human individuals.
&amp;nbsp;Technology advances, and in particular the recent emergence of
 a new generation of sequencing systems, have enabled the launch of
several such projects that are producing stunning insights into biology
and disease.&amp;nbsp; Nevertheless, the cost to completely sequence
large numbers of entire genomes remains too high to allow complete
genome sequencing to be used routinely, and we remain far from achieving
 the low costs and high quality needed to enable the use of
comprehensive genomic sequence information in individual health
care.\n\n\tA few examples of high priority research to which genomic
sequencing at high quality and dramatically reduced cost would make
vital contributions include:\n\n\t\n\t\tComparative genomic analyses
across species to yield insights into the structure and function of the
human genome and, consequently, the genetics of human health and
disease;\n\t\n\t\tStudies of human genetic variation and its
relationship to health and disease, in large numbers of individuals,
that capture not only common single nucleotide variation but also rare,
copy number, and structural variants that are increasingly thought to
play an important role in complex disease;\n\t\n\t\tCharacterization of
somatic changes in the genome that contribute to cancer, revealing
information from large numbers of matched tumor\/normal samples on a
genome-wide basis rather than restricting analysis to
&amp;ldquo;suspect&amp;rdquo; genomic regions that are based on
incomplete knowledge;\n\t\n\t\tAdditional genome sequences of
agriculturally important animals and plants that are needed to study
individual variation, different domesticated breeds and wild variants of
 each species; and\n\t\n\t\tSequence analysis of microbial communities,
many members of which cannot be cultured.&amp;nbsp; This will provide a
rich source of medically and environmentally useful
information.&amp;nbsp; Accurate, rapid sequencing may also be the best
approach to microbial monitoring of food and the environment, including
rapid detection and mitigation of bioterrorism threats.\n\n\n\tThe broad
 utility and high importance of dramatically reducing DNA sequencing
costs prompted the NHGRI, in 2004, to embark on two parallel technology
development programs (Nature Biotech. 26:1113, 2008). &amp;nbsp;The
first had the objective of reducing the cost of producing a high quality
 sequence of a mammalian-sized genome by two orders of magnitude, to
about $100,000. &amp;nbsp;This goal has been achieved so no additional
grant applications are being solicited at this time. Rather, the NHGRI
is focusing its efforts on attaining the goal of the second program,
which, as described in this FOA and parallel FOAs for other grant
mechanisms, is the development of technologies with which to sequence a
human genome for about $1,000 (a four order of magnitude cost
reduction). &amp;nbsp;Implicit in this goal is the quality of the
expected sequence product, as sequencing cost targets are meaningless
without associated quality standards as described below.\n\n\tSequencing
 Strategy and Quality\n\n\tThe sequencing technology that was used to
produce the reference human genome sequence (Nature 431:931, 2004;
Nature 409:860, 2001; Science 291:1304, 2001) was fluorescence detection
 of dideoxynucleotide-terminated DNA extension reactions resolved by
capillary array electrophoresis (CAE). &amp;nbsp;Individual sequence
&amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; segments can be as long as 1000 nucleotides.
&amp;nbsp;If all of the DNA in a 3 Gb genome were unique, it would be
possible to determine the sequence of the entire genome by generating a
sufficient number (tens of millions) of randomly-overlapping 1000-base
reads and aligning their overlaps. &amp;nbsp;However, the human and the
majority of other interesting genomes contain a substantial amount of
repetitive DNA. &amp;nbsp;To cope with the complexities of repetitive
DNA elements and to assemble the thousand-base reads in the correct
long-range order across the genome, genomic sequencing methods involve a
 variety of additional strategies, such as the sequencing of both ends
of cloned DNA fragments, use of libraries of cloned fragments of
specified lengths, incorporation of map information, achievement of
substantial redundancy (multiple reads of each nucleotide from
overlapping fragments) and application of sophisticated assembly
algorithms to filter and align the reads. &amp;nbsp;As new sequencing
technologies are developed, they must incorporate means to deal with
these features of the structure of the genome.\n\n\tThe gold standard
for genomic sequencing is based on the above-described methods and
remains =99.99% accuracy (not more than one error per 10,000
nucleotides) with essentially no gaps
(http:\/\/www.genome.gov\/10000923). &amp;nbsp;The
&amp;ldquo;finishing&amp;rdquo; steps needed to achieve that very high
quality have not been automated and thus require substantial
hand-crafting. &amp;nbsp;However, experience shows that much comparative
 and medically useful sequence information can be obtained from
automatically generated sequence assemblies that are known as
&amp;ldquo;high-quality draft&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;comparative
grade.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;Therefore, the cost targets for
NHGRI&amp;rsquo;s sequencing technology development programs were
originally defined in terms of a mammalian-sized genome with a sequence
quality equivalent to or better than that of the mouse draft assembly
published in December 2002 (Nature 420:520, 2002). &amp;nbsp;Producing
such a product for $1,000 is still not possible, so this remains a
useful and challenging technology target. &amp;nbsp;Unquestionably, the
ultimate need, for medical research and individualized medicine, is for
far higher quality sequence of the 3 Gb diploid human
genome.\n\n\tSubsequent to dideoxy\/CAE sequencing, a second generation
of sequencing technologies has been developed and implemented.
&amp;nbsp;These are broadly described as array-based methods in which
large numbers of templates are extended one base at a time, the
extensions are detected, and that cycle is repeated (reviewed in Nature
Biotechnology October 2008). &amp;nbsp;These technologies enable the
sequencing of larger numbers of genomes for under $100,000 dollars each,
 and even less for targeted sequencing of particular genomic regions.
&amp;nbsp;While challenges remain related to producing and interpreting
sequence information using these technologies, they are proving
invaluable to the biomedical research enterprise and they validate the
impetus toward further substantial decreases in cost with increases in
quality, throughput and speed of genomic sequencing.\n\n\tThe eventual
goal of these programs is to achieve technologies that can produce
assembled sequence of genomes that had not been previously sequenced
(i.e., de novo sequencing).&amp;nbsp; However, an accompanying goal is
to obtain highly accurate sequence data at the single base level that
can be overlain on a reference sequence of the organism (i.e.,
re-sequencing). &amp;nbsp;This could be achieved, for example, with
short reads that lack information linking them to other reads.
&amp;nbsp;In spite of shortcomings (some of which are described below),
re-sequencing would potentially be available sooner and of considerable
value for certain studies on disease etiology and individualized
medicine. &amp;nbsp;Therefore, technology development for re-sequencing
will be supported under this FOA. &amp;nbsp;As the cost goal for the
more difficult challenge, de novo assembly sequencing, is $1,000, the
goal for re-sequencing is to develop technologies that will provide a
genome&amp;rsquo;s worth of less-well-mapped sequence for well below
$1,000.\n\n\tFor re-sequencing, the per-base accuracy must be sufficient
 to distinguish between sequencing errors and real polymorphism.
&amp;nbsp;Additional challenges include assigning reads to gene families
 with very similar sequence, the identification of copy number changes
and genomic rearrangements, and the identification of haplotypes (i.e.,
linear juxtapositioning of particular single nucleotide polymorphism
[SNP] alleles along a single chromosome) in diploid organisms.
&amp;nbsp;Thus, in proposing the development of re-sequencing
technologies, it is essential that the applicant clearly address the
extent to which the proposed technology will meet or fall short of these
 various challenges, and the cost tradeoffs that justify developing the
technology to produce data of high value for particular biomedical
studies.\n\n\tSpecific Areas of Research Interest\n\n\tThe goal of
research supported under this FOA is to develop new or improved
technology to enable rapid, efficient DNA sequencing of mammalian-sized
genomes. &amp;nbsp;The target cost for a 3 Gb diploid genome sequence
determined at reasonably high quality is about $1,000 because the
ability to generate routinely complete genomic sequences at that cost
would revolutionize biological research and medicine.\n\n\tBoth
fundamental scientific discovery and cutting edge engineering will
likely be needed to achieve these goals. &amp;nbsp;For example, new
sensing and detection modalities and fabrication methods may be
required, and the physics of systems operating at nm length scales will
need to be better understood.&amp;nbsp; It is therefore anticipated that
 applications responding to this FOA will involve fundamental and
engineering research conducted by multidisciplinary teams of
investigators. &amp;nbsp;The guidance for budget requests accommodates
the formation of groups having investigators at several institutions, in
 cases where that is needed to assemble a team of the appropriate
balance, breadth and experience.\n\n\tThe scientific and technical
challenges inherent in achieving the cost goals are significant.
Achieving these goals may require research projects that entail
substantial risk. &amp;nbsp;That risk should be balanced by an
outstanding scientific and management plan designed to achieve the very
high payoff goals of this FOA. &amp;nbsp;High-risk\/high-payoff projects
 may fail for legitimate reasons, so applicants proposing such projects
should identify them as such, elaborate key quantitative milestones to
be achieved, and describe the consequences of not achieving those
milestones in a reasonable period of time.\n\n\tApplicants may propose
to develop full-scale sequencing systems or investigate key components
of such systems. &amp;nbsp;For the latter, applicants must describe how
the knowledge gained as a result of the proposed project would be
incorporated into a full system that they or others might subsequently
propose to develop. &amp;nbsp;Such independent applications are an
important path for pursuing novel, high-risk\/high-payoff ideas, short
of developing a full system.\n\n\tWhile the major focus of this program
is on the development of new technologies for detection of nucleotide
sequence, any successful technology will have to address matters related
 to the practical implementation of the technologies so that the
technology can form the basis of, or be incorporated into, an efficient,
 high quality, high-throughput DNA sequencing scheme. &amp;nbsp;Any new
technology will eventually need to be incorporated effectively into a
sequencing workflow, starting with a biological sample and ending with
sequence data of the desired quality. &amp;nbsp;Sample preparation
requirements can depend upon the detection method which, in turn, can
affect the way in which output data are handled. &amp;nbsp;If a full
system development is proposed, these issues should be addressed on an
appropriate schedule in the research plan; applicants should focus as
early as possible in the research plan on the most critical and
highest-risk aspects of the project related to determining the sequence
of nucleotides, on which the rest of the project depends.
&amp;nbsp;Projects to address key components must address the
fundamental method of determining the base sequence (that is, an
application addressing only sample prep or only the downstream
informatics would not be considered responsive to this FOA).\n\n\tMost
technology developers lack practical experience in high-throughput
sequencing and in testing of methods and instruments for robust, routine
 sequencing operation. &amp;nbsp;Applicants may therefore wish to
include such expertise as they develop their teams. &amp;nbsp;Academic
investigators may wish to consider collaborating with commercial
entities that have the experience and capabilities to bring practical
systems into the hands of users.\n\n\tThe quality of sequence to be
generated by the technology is of paramount importance for this FOA.
&amp;nbsp;Two major factors contributing to genomic sequence quality are
 per-base accuracy and contiguity of the assembly. &amp;nbsp;Much of the
 utility of comparative sequence information will derive from
characterization of sequence variation between species, and between
individuals of a species. &amp;nbsp;Therefore, per-base accuracy must be
 high enough to discern polymorphism at the single-nucleotide level
(substitutions, insertions, deletions) and distinguish polymorphism from
 sequencing errors. &amp;nbsp;Experience and resulting policy have
established a target accuracy of not more than one error per 10,000
bases. &amp;nbsp;All applications in response to this FOA, whether to
develop re-sequencing or de novo sequencing technologies, must propose
to achieve at least this standard.\n\n\tAssembly information is needed
for determining sequence of new genomes and ultimately also for genomes
for which a reference sequence exists, to detect rearrangements,
insertions, deletions, and copy number changes. &amp;nbsp;All of these
are genomic changes that have been shown to be associated with disease,
and knowledge of rearrangements can reveal new biological mechanisms.
&amp;nbsp;The phase of single nucleotide polymorphisms to define
haplotypes is important in understanding and diagnosing disease.
&amp;nbsp;Achieving a high level of sequence contiguity may be essential
 to achieve the full benefit from the use of sequencing for
individualized medicine, e.g., to evaluate genomic contributions to risk
 for specific diseases and syndromes, and drug responsiveness.
&amp;nbsp;Nevertheless, it is recognized that perfect sequence assembly
from end to end of each chromosome is unlikely to be achievable with
most technologies in a fully automated fashion and without adding
considerable cost. &amp;nbsp;Therefore, for the purpose of this FOA,
grant applications proposing technology development for de novo
sequencing shall describe how they will achieve, for about $1,000, a
draft-quality assembly that is at least comparable to that represented
by the mouse draft sequence produced by December 2002:
&amp;nbsp;7.7-fold coverage, 6.5-fold coverage in Q20 bases, assembled
into 225,000 sequence contigs connected by at least two read-pair links
into supercontigs [total of 7,418 supercontigs at least 2 kb long], with
 N50 length for contigs equal to 24.8 kb and for supercontigs equal to
16.9 Mb (Nature 420:520, 2002). &amp;nbsp;Grant applications that
propose technology development for re-sequencing should fully describe
the qualities and characteristics of the genomic sequence information
that the technology would produce, and the projected cost.
&amp;nbsp;That cost should be at least four orders of magnitude lower
than was the cost to produce comparable quality data in 2004, when this
program was initiated.\n\n\tGrant applications will be evaluated, and
funding decisions made, in such a way as to develop a balanced portfolio
 that has strong potential to develop both robust de novo and
re-sequencing technologies, exploring a variety of technology
approaches. &amp;nbsp;If the estimate is correct, that achieving the
goal of $1,000 de novo genome sequencing incorporating substantial
assembly information will be achieved by about 2014, then low-cost
re-sequencing technologies for even lower cost might be expected in a
shorter time. &amp;nbsp;Projects with a plan to achieve re-sequencing
while on the path to de novo sequencing will receive
priority.\n\n\tResearch conducted under this FOA may include development
 of the computational tools associated with the technology, e.g., to
extract sequence information, including image analysis and signal
processing, and to evaluate sequence quality and assign confidence
scores.&amp;nbsp; It may also address strategies to assemble the
sequence from the information being obtained from the technology or by
merging the sequence data with information from parallel
technology.&amp;nbsp; Applications that incorporate effective plans to
develop systems that address the bioinformatics challenges in concert
with the sequencing wet-ware will receive high priority
consideration.&amp;nbsp; However, this FOA will not support development
of sequence assembly or sequence analysis software independent of
technology development to obtain the linear nucleotide
sequence.\n\n\tThis program is aimed at technology to sequence entire
genomes.&amp;nbsp; Projects are under way to determine sequence from
selected important regions (e.g., all of the genes). &amp;nbsp;Grant
applications that propose to meet the cost targets by sequencing only
selected regions of a genome will be considered unresponsive to this
FOA. &amp;nbsp;However, applications that propose novel ways to sequence
 selected genomic regions, cost-effectively, while on a path to
whole-genome sequencing, will be considered responsive.\n\n\tNHGRI is
interested in supporting diverse approaches to achieving the goals of
this FOA.&amp;nbsp; To assist the research community, investigators who
are pursuing one set of technology paths that involve the use of
nanopores and nanogaps published an overview of the challenges they face
 (Nature Biotech. 26:1146, 2008).&amp;nbsp; Similarly, challenges
attending sequencing by synthesis have been described (Nature Biotech.
27:1013, 2009).&amp;nbsp; Grant applications to meet these and related
challenges, and to pursue alternative technologies, are welcome under
this FOA.&amp;nbsp; Information on projects funded under earlier

importance at synchrotron light sources.  This class of detector
combines the efficient X-ray collection of a silicon-drift detector with
 energy resolution approaching that of a crystal- or grating-based
spectrometer.  Important applications are X-ray emission spectroscopy,
partial-fluorescence-yield NEXAFS, and energy-resolved
scattering-momentum experiments.  Emerging cryogenic detector
technologies include TESs as well as microwave kinetic-inductance
detectors (MKIDs), magnetic calorimeters (mag-cals), and superconducting
 tunnel junctions (STJs).  These technologies share the common
architecture of a pixelated active area that must be held at extreme
cryogenic temperatures (~0.050.3 K).  In the case of TESs, expansion to
kilopixel-scale arrays with total active areas of hundreds of mm^2 is a
near-term goal.  Because the cryogenic-sensing elements must be able to
observe ambient-temperature samples, X-ray-transmitting windows are a
critical enabling technology.  Here we solicit development of a type of
X-ray windows that has high transmission in the soft-X-ray band of
2501000 eV (K lines of organics and L lines of transition metals):
vacuum interfaces.  \n\nPresent, commercially available,
high-transmission vacuum windows are made from Beryllium or grid-backed

down to 250 eV are limited to a diameter of about 10mm.  We seek designs

could contain multiple, gridded active areas separated by thin support
struts  we envision that each sub-window might have an open area of 2550
 mm^2 and the sub-windows might be separated by supports that are
several mm wide-thick.  Other ideas are encouraged.  The awardee would
be expected to develop window designs in coordination with developers of
 cryogenic sensors (such as ANL or NIST) so that the active areas of the
 windows and the detector arrays can be matched.  Window designs that
will support ~0.1 atmosphere (in either direction) with much larger
active areas are also sought.  Improved vacuum-interface windows would
also be applicable to conventional, semiconducting x-ray sensors.",

USING NEUTRON SCATTERING",
        "description": "As a unique and increasingly utilized research
tool, neutron scattering makes invaluable contributions to the physical,
 chemical, and nanostructured materials sciences.  The Department of
Energy supports neutron scattering and spectroscopy facilities at
neutron sources where users conduct state-of-the-art materials research.
  Their experiments are enabled by the convergence of a range of
instrumentation technologies.  The Department of Energy is committed to
enhancing the operation and instrumentation of its present and future
neutron scattering facilities (References 1-3) so that their full
potential is realized. \n\nThis topic seeks to develop advanced
instrumentation that will enhance materials research employing neutron
scattering.  Grant applications should define the instrumentation need
and outline the research that will enable innovation beyond the current
state-of-the-art.  Applicants are strongly encouraged to demonstrate
applicability and proper context through collaboration with a successful
 user of neutron sources.  To this end, the STTR program would be an
appropriate vehicle for proposal submission.  Alternatively, applicants
are encouraged to demonstrate applicability by providing a letter of
support from a successful user.  Priority will be given to those grant
applications that include such collaborations or letters of
support.\n\nA successful user is defined as someone at a research
institution who has recently performed neutron scattering experiments
and published results in peer reviewed archival journals.   Such
researchers are the early adopters of new instrumentation and are often
involved in conceptualizing, fabricating, and testing new devices.  A
starting point for developing collaborations would be to examine the

 energy technologies and to support DOE missions in energy, environment,
 and national security.&amp;nbsp; The results of BES\u2010supported
research are routinely published in the open literature. A key function
of the program is to plan, construct, and operate premier scientific
user facilities for the development of novel nanomaterials and for
materials characterization through x\u2010ray and neutron scattering;
the former is accomplished through five Nanoscale Science Research
Centers and the latter is accomplished through the world's largest suite
 of light source and neutron scattering facilities.&amp;nbsp; These
national resources are available free of charge to all researchers based
 on the quality and importance of proposed nonproprietary experiments. A
 major objective of the BES program is to promote the transfer of the
results of our basic research to advance and create technologies
important to Department of Energy (DOE) missions in areas of energy
efficiency, renewable energy resources, improved use of fossil fuels,
the mitigation of the adverse impacts of energy production and use, and
future nuclear energy sources.&amp;nbsp; The following set of technical

subtopics: &amp;nbsp;a. Technology Transfer Opportunity: Synthesis of
High Quality Graphene Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has
developed a technology for synthesizing high homogeneity, micrometer
scale graphene sheets. One highly successful approach has been
simultaneous vacuum thermal decomposition of two SiC substrates, placed
in close, face\u2010to\u2010face proximity to each other. The thickness
of the graphene is controlled by adjusting the annealing temperature and
 duration of heating. Atomic force microscopy measurements demonstrate
the homogeneity of graphene is notably improved by this
face\u2010to\u2010face method compared with other, conventional methods.
 This method does not require sophisticated fabrication, or elaborate
specifications or additional materials for the restriction of the Si
sublimation rate.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Graphene shows promising potential
 for a wide variety of technological applications such as post\u2010CMOS
 digital electronics, single\u2010molecule gas sensors, and spintronic
devices, among others. For graphene to be successfully applied to new
devices, homogeneous growth of graphene with device\u2010sized scale
(micrometer) on a semiconducting or insulating substrate is essential.

Technology Transfer Opportunity: Minimal Disturbance Cell Injection
System The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory nanoinjector is a
system where nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes, nanorods, etc. are
 bound to lectins and\/or polysaccharides and prepared for
administration to cells. The chemical attachment of the cargo eliminates
 need for a carrier solvent, which adds undesirable volume to the cell.
Use of the injector is not limited to larger cells.&amp;nbsp; In its
current configuration the injector is attached to the tip of an atomic
force microscope (AFM) probe. The cargo is released in the reducing
environment within the cell\u2019s interior. The nanoneedle is then
retracted by AFM control. The amount of cargo released within the cell
can be adjusted by varying the amount of time the nanoneedle remains in
the cell.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Molecular probes such as the quantum dot
can be inserted into the cell and thus probe the cell\u2019s interior
for fine details such as the presence of a specific molecule. The LBNL
team has already been proven successful in delivering small numbers of
protein\u2010coated quantum dots into a line of mammalian cells. LBNL is
 seeking a company that would develop a cargo loading and release
mechanism that would facilitate use of the nanoinjector as a
\u201cplug\u2010and\u2010play\u201d technology for a variety of
cargos.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Licensing Information: Lawrence Berkeley

        "description": "Wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors  with bandgaps
 significantly greater than 1.7 eV  include silicon carbide (SiC),
gallium nitride (GaN), zinc oxide (ZnO) and diamond (C).  They offer the
 opportunity for dramatic performance and efficiency improvements in a
variety of applications needed for energy relevant applications such as
power electronics, solid-state lighting, fuel cells, photovoltaics, and
sensing in harsh environments.  Compared to todays silicon (Si)-based
technologies, WBG-based devices operate at higher ambient temperatures
(e.g. higher than 150C without external cooling), withstand greater
voltages (&amp;amp;gt;10s of kV) over time, and switch at much higher
frequencies (10s of kHz to 10s of MHz) with lower power losses. While
devices employing these materials in bulk or in thin film form have
started to be adopted for use in power electronics in areas such as 500 W
 or higher switch-mode power supplies and solar inverters, widespread
adoption in critical energy relevant lower power markets such as 50-150 W
 external power supplies for consumer electronics and appliances,
electric drive vehicles, medium voltage motor controls, and grid power
conversion will likely require significant improvements in device
reliability  especially for SiC MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field
 Effect Transistors).  Increasing reliability and overcoming other
barriers would improve the integration and interface of renewables at
multiple points onto the grid and accelerate the deployment of
transportation-based technologies such as electric drive vehicles and

        "topic_name": "Increasing Ruggedness of Sic Mosfets against
Cosmic Rays at the Earths Surface",
        "description": "As new WBG high voltage semiconductors and
transistor topologies are developed, identification of failure modes and
 the conditions that initiate them are becoming increasingly important
to ensure reliable use for space based applications. Issues with
performance degradation and failure of Si power devices attributable to
cosmic radiation has been observed in the use of these device in both
space and high altitude applications.  Although fewer and lower energy
cosmic rays reach the Earths surface, this phenomenon is an increasing
concern for terrestrial applications of power devices. Studies have
shown that cosmic-ray-induced effects can strongly influence the voltage
 derating necessary for the safe and long term use of Si MOSFETs and
IGBTs, directly affecting their adoption and use in various
applications. Cosmic-ray-induced errorsmainly due to neutrons--will only
 worsen as circuit size continues to shrink.  Proposals will need to
establish and compare the influence of cosmic radiation on SiC MOSFETs
and Si IGBTs under identical conditions in regards to cosmic radiation
events.  The effects will need to be analyzed to determine the long term
 reliability and performance of these technologies. Through these
results, designers will be able to make better choices in the use of
either Si or SiC for different applications.  Additionally,
semiconductor developers will be better equipped to develop design
solutions once their reliabity has been established. Ultimately, the
acceptance of WBG devices can result in dramatic energy savings across a
 broad spectrum of applications including switched-mode power supply,
motor control, traction, solar and aerospace industries. \n\nThe high
energy particles in cosmic rays are known to damage high voltage Si
power devices such as diodes, IGBTs, MOSFETs and thyristors resulting in
 single-event upsets (SEUs) such as single event burnout (SEB) and
single event gate rupture (SEGR).  SEB is caused by the initiation of
destructive avalanching due to drain-source filamentation resulting from
 activation of parasitic thyristors and-or bipolar transistors present
in all devices except diodes.  SEB in diodes is simply due to excessive
leakage current induced by high energy particles while the device is
biased at a high voltage.  In MOSFETs and IGBTs, SEGR can occur due to
the generation of a high transient field across the gate oxide and
subsequent discharge of accumulated holes through the gate oxide.   As a
 consequence of these issues, typical Si devices are limited to
approximately 50% of their rated voltage in characteristic usage.
Although these devices are likely to be more robust against cosmic ray
damage due to the very poor gain of parasitic npn BJTs in SiC power
MOSFETs, gate rupture may still occur.  \n\nAlthough initial work has
demonstrated the ruggedness of SiC power MOSFETs, more in-depth
fundamental experiments are needed [5-7].  The typical testing method,
designed to quickly obtain information, is to irradiate devices with
high energy neutrons (50-80 MeV, ~104 n-cm2).  This method accelerates
the failures to enable gathering the necessary data within weeks, but it
 is expensive and requires access to a high energy neutron beam
facility.  Another method (called the real-time terrestrial method) is
easier to implement but requires a substantial number of devices
(&amp;amp;gt;100) for testing.  The proposal for this subtopic should be
 to bias a large number of devices at high voltage and room temperature
with a series resistance to limit the current and observe failures over a
 few months.  The devices should be mounted flat to increase the flux of
 cosmic-rays impinging on the devices.  The bias across the devices
should be varied from 50- 100% of the rated voltage in stepped
increments and readings should be taken at each bias point for an
established period of time (e.g. 10 weeks). The goal of this subtopic
will be to compare commercially available high voltage Si IGBTs and SiC
MOSFETs devices to establish their resistance to radiation effects.",

pyrolysis of biomass and biochemical methods such as enzymatic
conversion of sugar intermediates. Many of these conversion technologies
 result in the production of an aqueous waste stream that contains

these conversion technologies could be improved if by-products in the

Access to real aqueous waste streams through collaboration with a

applications such as petroleum refining, NH3 and biofuels production,
hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), as well as for energy
storage through injection into natural gas pipelines. Use of hydrogen
results in the need for innovative durable sealing materials for extreme
 use conditions that exhibit low hydrogen permeability and high
durability in dynamic sealing.  In particular, proposals investigating
materials at high pressure (&amp;amp;gt;875 bar) and extreme
temperatures (&amp;amp;gt;475K and &amp;amp;lt; 33K) and polymeric
materials for use as seals in extreme environmental conditions including
 high pressure (up to 130 MPa) and variable temperatures (-50
&amp;amp;lt; T &amp;amp;gt;200 oC) are needed for hydrogen applications.
 Applications include dynamic compressors seals, valve seats and fiber
reinforced polymer pipeline and tank liners. In particular the seals
currently used in hydrogen compressors have a lifetime of 2,000-8,000
hours. The range in the durability of the seals is largely due to the
duty cycle and operating temperature of the compressors. Additionally
some seal materials have been found to be susceptible to hydrogen
permeation while under high pressure and subsequent blistering on
depressurization. This failure mode is not the same as the rupture seen
during explosive decompression. Materials development is needed for
dynamic compressor seals which can contain hydrogen at pressures of
1,320 bar (1.5x the application working pressure of 875 bar) while
operating for &amp;amp;gt;18,000 hours under cyclic pressure loading at
200C [1].  Materials developed would also be applicable to other balance
 of plant components such as the dispenser hoses, valve seals, and high
pressure storage tank liners.\n\nPhase I must include identification and

hours of use in hydrogen at temperatures of 200C and pressures of 1,320

sealing applications. Results of phase I should include a report
summarizing the findings and suggesting modifications to the polymers to
 improve their performance. Phase II would include the development and
in-depth characterization of the selected or modified polymers.
Research should include a scientific exploration of the mechanisms of
failure in cyclic high pressure and high temperature hydrogen
environments of the application. Characterization should also include
the hydrogen permeation, hydrogen uptake, creep, and other degradation
mechanisms needed to provide a better understanding of the durability,
mechanical stability, and service life of a material used in severe or

research are routinely published in the open literature. A key function
of the program is to plan, construct, and operate premier scientific
user facilities for the development of novel nanomaterials and for
materials characterization through x\u2010ray and neutron scattering;
the former is accomplished through five Nanoscale Science Research
Centers and the latter is accomplished through the world's largest suite

applications are sought in the following subtopics: &amp;nbsp;a.
Enabling Technologies for Advanced Combustion Systems Develop and
validate a predictive, multi\u2010scale, combustion model to optimize
the design and operation of a spouted bed using a coal and biomass
mixture to reduce GHG emissions. This predictive capability, if
attained, will change fundamentally the process for combustion of
combined fuels by establishing a scientific understanding of sufficient
depth and flexibility to facilitate realistic simulation of mixed fuel
combustion in these newly proposed power boiler designs.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;Similar understanding in aeronautics has produced the
beautiful and efficient complex curves of modern aircraft wings. These
designs could never have been realized through cut\u2010and\u2010try
engineering, but rather rely on the prediction and optimization of
complex air flows. An analogous experimentally validated, predictive
capability for combustion is a daunting challenge. This SBIR project
should demonstrate and validate the design and operation of the spouting
 fluidized bed for use with coal and biomass fueled combustion and
verifies how it compares with a conventional fluidized bed in terms of
efficiency and reduces carbon in ash due to better control of residence
time.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The scope of the project can comprise design,
fabrication, and testing of a small demonstrable unit with pulverized
coal and biomass as feedstock. Research will include collecting various
data and information to address any major technical gaps. If successful
in Phase 1 the project has a chance to move to Phase II where
substantially higher funding is given. &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013

Shale Gas Recovery Technologies for Horizontal Well Completion
OptimizationProposals are sought to develop and test technologies that
will reduce the amount of water needed for hydraulic fracturing when
completing natural gas wells or that will improve the apparent low
(&amp;lt;30%) natural gas and liquids recovery efficiency currently
associated with horizontal, hydraulically fractured wells producing from
 shale formations.&amp;nbsp; Proposals should focus on addressing a
number of important areas where cost effective improvements may be
possible. The objective is to increase the efficiency of resource
recovery on a per well basis or reduce the volume of fresh water
required to produce a unit volume of natural gas. For example, research
could include quantitative assessments of the practical and economic
limits and potential benefits (if any) of employing mixtures of natural
gas (not LPG as is currently practiced) with conventional
sand\u2010laden fracturing fluids, as a novel fracturing fluid to
partially replace water in the large volume, multiple stage hydraulic
fracturing treatments representative of those being applied in shale gas
 and shale oil plays today. &amp;nbsp;Examples of analyses could include
 laboratory experiments and\/or computer simulations that quantify the
effect on relative permeability to gas in a producing wellbore when
mixtures of conventional fracturing fluids and natural gas (versus
fracturing liquids only) are employed as fracturing fluids under
conditions representative of major shale gas plays. Research could
characterize the potential volumes and rates of natural
gas\/conventional fracturing fluid mixtures required to achieve well
productivity similar to that achieved when wells are fractured using
conventional fracturing fluids alone. &amp;nbsp;Other examples of
analysis could aim to characterize the suitability of the rheology of
such conventional fracturing fluid\/natural gas mixtures for large
volume hydraulic fracturing, and to&amp;nbsp; prove the feasibility of
employing natural gas as a partial alternative to water, as
justification for a Phase II field experiment focused on testing the
process. &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact: Al Yost,
albert.yost@netl.doe.gov&amp;nbsp;c. CO2 Use and Reuse To reduce risk
and offset the cost of CCS, development of CO2 utilization\/conversion
technologies, specifically those that rely on biological processes
(e.g., algae) or mineralization\/carbonation processes to generate
value\u2010added products will be required.&amp;nbsp; A larger and more
diverse market is needed to facilitate deeper GHG reductions from CO2
sales beyond what can be realized by Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)
alone.&amp;nbsp; For instance, a coal\u2010fired power plant equipped
with a CO2 capture and purification unit could offer multiple gas
streams with varying concentrations of CO2 potentially suitable for CO2
utilization\/conversion, including: (1) flue gas exiting the
desulfurization unit (prior to entering the downstream CO2 capture and
purification unit), (2) CO2\u2010dilute flue gas being directed to the
stack following bulk CO2 removal, and (3) concentrated CO2 exiting the
CO2 capture and purification unit that is ready for compression and
storage.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought for
 the development or enhancement of novel technologies that support
DOE\u2019s goals to reduce carbon emissions at a relative cost below $40
 per tonne of CO2.&amp;nbsp; It is expected that the revenue generated
from these novel utilization processes may result in positive
revenue.&amp;nbsp; The applicant must demonstrate a thorough
understanding of the biological or chemical CO2 utilization\/conversion
process being proposed and its ability to integrate with coal\u2010fired

will not create more CO2 than is utilized and\/or show that the CO2
emissions are less than the process that it would replace. Projects will

&amp;nbsp;DOE is currently supporting multiple small\u2010 and
large\u2010scale R&amp;amp;D projects to demonstrate the technical and
economic feasibility of CCS. While advances have been made to reduce the
 cost of implementation, cost remains a primary concern. Recent studies
support the approach that CO2 utilization should focus on identifying
technologies and opportunities that assist in reducing CO2 capture costs
 as a means to accelerate industrial\u2010scale implementation of
geologic storage. Consequently, technologies that support this approach

 to high\u2010temperature, high\u2010pressure conditions are a common
requirement for advanced fossil energy power generation
systems.&amp;nbsp; For example, power cycles based on steam on
supercritical CO2 are targeting temperatures in excess of 700 C to
enable highly efficient performance.&amp;nbsp; In these cycles, heat is
transferred from a heat source such as an air\u2010 or oxyfired coal
boiler or natural gas turbine into a power cycle working fluid by means
of heat exchange components such as boiler tubes, heat recovery steam
generator, heat exchanger, or recuperator.&amp;nbsp; Some of these heat
exchange environments contain very large pressure differentials
(20\u201025 MPa) while others may contain periodic or occasional
pressure fluctuations.&amp;nbsp; Alloys with the requisite corrosion
resistance and mechanical properties tend to be expensive.&amp;nbsp;
Alternatively, many ceramic materials are stable to much higher
temperatures providing an opportunity to improve cycle performance and
improve durability.&amp;nbsp; Ceramic components perform poorly in
tension requiring specialized engineering, in particular with respect to
 joining with adjacent components.&amp;nbsp; In other words, joining
ceramics to other high temperature metallic components is seen as an
enabling technology for high\u2010performance heat transfer components

        "description": "Emissions from energy and other anthropogenic
activities have been altering the chemical composition of the
atmosphere, both regionally and globally. Such modifications are linked
not only to environmental degradation and human health problems but also
 with changes in the most sensitive parts of the physical climate system
  namely, clouds and aerosols. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) is making progress toward its next major report, the Fifth
 Assessment Report (AR5), which will be released in 2013 and 2014. As
part of the IPCC assessment process, it has repeatedly been concluded
that  innovative measurement technologies are needed to provide both
input and comparison data for models used to assess the impacts of e.g.
energy emissions on the physical and chemical composition of aerosols
with particular attention to their subsequent influence on cloud
radiative properties. The technologies that are needed are required to
have much high accuracy and time stability than has been available to
the research community.   \n\nWhen the last IPCC report was published in
 2007, there was a lack of data to adequately represent some of the more
 climate sensitive regions, namely the Arctic and tropics.   The
Arctic, in particular, continues to be one of the most difficult places
on Earth for year-round scientific observations and research, due to a
combination both of remoteness and the difficulty of observing under
very cold conditions.  One of the major recommendations of an Arctic
Research Consortium of the U.S. (ARCUS), 1997 report, Logistics
Recommendations for an Improved U.S. Arctic Research Capability
(www.arcus.org-logistics-index.html), was to increase use of robotic
aircraft to meet the growing need for environmental observing in the
Arctic.  Partly in response to this recommendation, the DOE Atmospheric
Radiation Measurement (ARM) program (http:--www.arm.gov-) increased its
emphasis on arctic observations.  In the meantime since the release of
the 1997 report, there has been an increasing climate change signal in
the Arctic; and models have been dramatically underpredicting the rate
of change.  The DOE Climate and Environmental Sciences Division
identified in its recently released strategic plan to emphasize greater
attention to Arctic (and tropical) atmospheric sciences, by investing in
 the development of science and predictability of the climate system,
where more sophisticated measurement methods as well as computational
and analysis technologies underpin the development.  More advanced
measurement capabilities for aerosol absorption and scattering, cloud
properties, turbulence, and remote sensing are high priority needs of
the atmospheric sciences, particularly when such technologies are
deployable on small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  \nGrant
applications that respond to this Atmospheric Measurement Technology
topic  must propose Phase I bench tests of critical technologies.

composition of ambient aerosols, particularly carbonaceous aerosols.
Such improved measurements would be used to facilitate the
identification of the origin of aerosols, (i.e., primary versus
secondary and fossil fuel versus biogenic).  Also, improved measurements
 are needed to help elucidate how aerosol particles are processed in the
 atmosphere by chemical reactions and by clouds, and how their
hygroscopic properties change as they age. This information is important
 because relatively little is known about organic and absorbing
particles that are abundant in many locations in the atmosphere. In
particular, there is a need for instruments capable of real-time
measurements of the composition of these particles at the molecular
level.  Although recent advances have led to the development of new
instruments, such as particle mass spectrometers and single particle
analyzers, existing instruments still have important limitations in
their ability to quantify black carbon vs. organic carbon, provide
speciation of refractory and volatile organic compounds, and calibrate
both organic and inorganic components. Furthermore, instruments that
otherwise would be suitable for ground-based operation often have
limitations (size, weight, power, stability, etc.) that restrict their
application for in situ measurements, where critical atmospheric
processes actually occur (e.g., in or near clouds using aircraft or

 in aerosols; and (4) the ability to probe the chemical composition of
aerosol surfaces. \n\nIn order to address the deficiencies associated

 quantifiable results over a wide range of compounds, which is a
deficiency of laser ablation aerosol mass spectrometer methods; (2)
measurements over a range of volatility so that dust, carbon, and salt
are detectable, which is a deficiency of thermal decomposition aerosol
mass spectrometers; and (3) measurements with high time resolution,

 energy results from the burning of fossil fuels from vast reservoirs of
 coal, oil, and natural gas. These processes add carbon to the
atmosphere, principally in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2). It is
important to understand the fate of this excess CO2 in the global carbon
 cycle in order to assess contemporary terrestrial carbon sinks, the
sensitivity of climate to atmospheric CO2, and future potentials for
sequestration of carbon in terrestrial systems. Therefore, improved
measurement approaches are needed to quantify the change of CO2 in
atmospheric components of the global carbon cycle. There is also
interest in innovative approaches for flux and concentration
measurements of methane and other greenhouse gas constituents associated

belowground processes relevant to carbon cycling. \n\nThe First State of
 the Carbon Cycle Report (SOCCR) (Reference 1) and the Carbon Cycling

terrestrial carbon sinks for North America. Numerous working papers on
carbon sequestration science and technology also describes research

technology and measurement approaches for detecting changes of
atmospheric CO2 properties and of carbon quantities of terrestrial

Measurements",
        "description": "Fine roots (generally &amp;amp;lt; 2 mm in
diameter) play a critical role in the carbon and nutrient cycles of
ecosystems. Their production, distribution within the soil, and turnover
 must be measured to have a full understanding of how an ecosystem is
responding to perturbations such as climate change (Reference 2, 10 and
11).  Currently, the best method available for quantifying fine roots is
 minirhizotrons (Reference 12), which are used to periodically collect
images of intact roots with a camera inserted in a transparent tube
installed in the soil.  Current analysis of the collected images is
difficult, labor-intensive, and subject to operator biases.
Quantification and analysis is a particular challenge in certain
environments such as rocky soils and wetland ecosystems (Reference 13).
 \n\nGrant applications are sought for technology innovation to improve
current minirhizotron technologies and produce rapid assessments and
measurements of in situ fine root measurements.  Improvements should be
aimed at developing an integrated high-throughput system that captures
and processes images in real time and produces an automated replicable
and artifact-free analysis of the images.  Key capabilities should
include state-of-the-art analytical operations, immediate detection and
extraction of features (see item 2 below), and use of image-processing
filters for comparing images while keeping pace with the rate of image
capture.  Specific technology developments should include one or more of
 the following criteria:\n\n(1) Advanced Image Collection System  New,
low-cost imaging-camera designs and automated acquisition systems with
increased versatility in soil imaging and field conditions.  Device
flexibility of usage and portability are also sought (Reference 13).
\n\n(2) Automated Image Analysis  Software improvements to develop new
image-processing algorithms and automated solutions that can reduce the
amount of manual intervention required for each image analysis.  A
reliable, automated minirhizotron image analysis system would make
possible more consistency and greater data intensity.  An example of a
minirhizotron analysis system is RootFly
(http:--www.ces.clemson.edu-~stb-rootfly-), but this program has proven
inadequate for truly automated analysis, especially in systems where
there is little contrast between roots and the background soil matrix.
Specific high resolution root parameters that should be captured by
automated analysis include, but are not limited to: root length, root
diameter, color, turnover rates, and fungal presence.  Innovative
methods for automated analysis of fine root and fungal dynamics (i.e.,
production, mortality, and turnover calculate between sampling dates)
are also highly desired.\n\n(3) Three-dimensional Scaling and Image
Analysis  Current analysis methods cannot adequately scale 2-dimensional
 minirhizotron images to three-dimensional data.  There is potential for
 automated analysis of root edge resolution in order to quantify the
image depth of field, or whether a particular root was in focus and
therefore within a given depth of field (Reference 13). \n\n(4) Other
Non-Destructive Belowground Assessment Tools  Additionally, desired
measurement characteristics could include other non-destructive, remote
quantification or visualizations of fine roots in soil such as ground
penetrating radar (References 15 and 16) microscopic or high-resolution

gas, resulting primarily from microbial activity in the soil, and is
partially regulated by soil chemical and physical properties (for

space and time due to nitrogen amendments and other biogeochemical
perturbations in soils.  As a result, improved, real-time measurements
of N2O emission from soils are needed to quantify and eventually model
the connection of N2O emissions to environmental conditions. Current

industrial host microbes with resistance to valuable but potentially
toxic molecules, such as solvents and fuel-like compounds. Providing

desirable substances. The scientists used efflux pumps to confer
resistance on E. coli and developed a library of the most effective
pumps for protection against several compounds, such as geraniol,
limonene, pinene, and farnesyl hexanoate. These compounds represent
biogasoline, biodiesel, and biojetfuel candidates. Moreover, the method

engineering increases the biological production titers of compounds,
there is a growing need to overcome limitations posed by each compounds
toxicity, inhibition of cell growth, and intracellular feedback

Until now, these problems have been addressed primarily through
combinatorial approaches, such as adaptation, genome shuffling, and

Production of a Biosynthetic Product in Specific Plant Tissues",
        "description": "The JBEI has developed a technology that can be
used to fine-tune desirable biomass traits in plants. A key feature of
the invention is the design of an artificial positive feedback loop
whereby a transcription factor induces increased transcription of
itself. Gene promoters are selected according to the desired outcome,
for example, to improve saccharification efficiency or to raise the
level of desirable hexose sugars in relation to hard-to-ferment
pentoses. Some promoters can boost secondary cell wall deposition of
cellulose; others can decrease deposition of lignin or hemicellulose
(xylan). With similar promoter engineering, increased wax production can
 be directed to the epidermal layers of a plant, improving drought
tolerance and efficient water use while preserving energy for increased
production of biomass. This versatile technology can be used to improve
crops used for biofuels and paper production; provide livestock with
more digestible forage; extend the range of crops to marginal land; or
produce stronger timber for construction, among other applications.
Unlike other genetic engineering methods, when applied to increasing
secondary cell wall deposition, the JBEI technologies alter biosynthesis
 in plant fibers but not in vascular tissue or leaves. Thus they do not
adversely affect growth, fertility, or the fruit- or grain-bearing
capacity of the plants. Because this new method involves dominant traits
 and uses genetic promoters that are part of conserved pathways, it will
 be applicable across many species, including polyploids and sterile
plants. Moreover, its application does not require sequencing of the
entire genome of the target plant or the presence of a particular
variety or cultivar. To date, the technology has been applied to three
applications: \n\n1. Controlling Lignin Deposition: To fine-tune lignin
deposition, the scientists started with a mutant of Arabidopsis that
under-produces lignin in all tissues. The JBEI scientists then
selectively restored lignin biosynthesis to vascular tissue but not
fiber cells by expressing a wild-type allele under the regulation of a
promoter that is expressed only in vascular tissue. The engineered
plants were morphologically and developmentally identical to the wild
type, but they had a total lignin level that was approximately 33% less.
 When tested with several different pretreatment methods, biomass from
the engineered plants had a saccharification efficiency 1.5-2.3 times
greater than that of wild types. \n\n2. Controlling Xylan Deposition:
Using a method similar to that described above, the scientists started
with a mutant with a defective allele for a key gene in xylan
biosynthesis. They then selectively restored expression of a normal
allele to vascular tissue only. The resulting plants have a reduced
amount of hemicellulose relative to cellulose. Thus, compared to wild
types, these plants can be pretreated more easily for biofuel
production, yield more glucose per unit of biomass, and produce fewer
low-value byproducts such as pentose from biofuels production or black
liquor from pulping. \n\n3. Increasing Wood Density and Drought
Tolerance: In this application, promoters are used in a positive
feedback loop to increase traits such as wood density or drought
tolerance. To boost wood density, JBEI scientists upregulated a
transcription factor that induces the expression of genes involved in
secondary cell wall synthesis in native tissues. This upregulation
occurs only in fiber cells and in a manner that does not interfere with
growth, cell expansion, or nutrient transport. When this technology was
combined with the fine-tuning of lignin deposition, stem density was
increased by almost 20% and the saccharification efficiency was two- to
three-times greater than that of wild types. While boosting yields, the
technology can also decrease the cost of transporting biomass from the
field to the biorefinery.",

of technologies to engineer feedstock plants with increased galactan
content. Galactans are composed of hexoses that are easily fermented, in
 contrast to the hemicellulose xylan, the most abundant non-cellulosic
component of biomass, which is composed of pentoses, which are difficult
 to ferment. By increasing galactan content, the JBEI technology has the
 potential to increase digestibility and yield of fermentable sugars of
feedstocks. Galactan also has the potential to substitute for pentosans,
 polysaccharides made of pentoses, in lignocellulosic biomass.
Specifically, the technology involves overexpressing Arabidopsis
beta-1,4-galactan synthase genes. These can be expressed alone or in
conjunction with genes involved in UDP-Galactose biosynthesis, thus
increasing the availability of UDP-galactose to increase both
beta-1,4-galactan in the cell walls and, more generally, the galactose
component of cell wall matrix polysaccharides. Furthermore, the genes
may be expressed in conjunction with genes encoding specific

traits, while the embedded feedback loop induces increased transcription
 of the switch itself, sustaining the production of those traits. The
APFL strategy was first employed successfully to fine tune secondary
cell wall synthesis in the model plant Arabidopsis. The new JBEI
technology extends this strategy with a feedback loop that works in
yeast, which is a model organism for many types of fungal cells. By
identifying key genes in yeast that can be controlled in this manner,
the researchers have demonstrated that this technology for plants can be
 adapted to entirely different organisms. In yeast, it confers traits
that can potentially transform fungal cell cultures into efficient
factories for the production of chemicals ranging from biofuels to
pharmaceuticals.",

synthetic pathway in cells to 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate (DXP). Both
routes allow more direct conversion of carbon to terpenoid compounds
circumventing the typical, but inherently inefficient, route to DXP. The
 JBEI process results in the conservation of 17% of carbon being
converted to terpenoid products. The novel pathways to DXP entail
conversion of xylulose-5-phosphate to DXP, which circumvents the loss of
 CO2 and provides a higher theoretical yield, particularly if xylose is
included as a carbon source. It also provides a second metabolite pool
(the essential pentose phosphate pathway) for isoprenoid biosynthesis.
In the case of having a mixed carbon source (for example, xylose and
glucose from a hemicellulose feedstock), it is envisioned that a large
fraction of the xylose component could be primarily converted to the
isoprenoid product since the carbon is diverted at the entry point into
metabolism (xylulose-5-P). The novel routes into the DXP pathway could
also be used in conjunction with the normal DXP-mediated route to
maximize flux.",

concentration of cellular fadR, a transcriptional factor protein that
regulates genes responsible for fatty acid activation and several genes

rate and enhances unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, resulting in an
increase in total fatty acid production. The current approach to
increasing fatty acid yield is engineering thioesterase enzymes, which
are responsible for converting fatty acyl-CoA into fatty acids. But this

overcomes these shortcomings. Researchers introduced a plasmid that
contained the fadR gene under the control of an inducible promoter and
measured its effect on fatty acid production. Total fatty acid yield
reached 5.2 g-l, six times more than the yield using a previous fatty
acid production strain. Results correspond to approximately 75%
conversion of the carbon source. Additional testing to understand fadRs
mechanism indicated that fadR increases fatty acid production by
changing cells overall metabolism rather than acting on one specific

Pretreatment increases the capital equipment needs and costs of the

production is increasing the cost of food. What is needed is non-food

 This GLBRC technology is a method and composition for improving the
digestibility of plant biomasses by increasing the methylesterification
of homogalacturonan (HG) in the plant cell wall. Methylesterification is
 increased via the overexpression of certain methyltransferases. The
methyltransferases act on HG molecules before they are delivered to the
apoplast, thus not interfering with the amount of de-esterified HG in
the cell wall. Presence of highly demethylesterified pectin improves
digestibility of plant biomasses while maintaining normal amounts of
esterified HG prevents negative effects on the plants mechanical
strength and growth. Ultimately, this technology reduces cost of

        "description": "Production of alternative fuels such as
biodiesel is on the rise around the world and in the U.S. due to a
strong and growing desire to reduce dependency on petroleum-derived
diesel fuel. The acceptance of biodiesel has been slowed due to its
higher cost relative to petroleum-derived diesel. The higher cost of
biodiesel is directly related to the cost of feedstock used for
biodiesel production, which is often derived from crops also used for
food. The displacement of food crops by energy crops causes higher food
prices and is fueling a rapidly growing social, environmental, economic,
 and political push to move away from food crops for alternative fuel
production.  This GLBRC technology is plants modified to divert
metabolic activity from carbohydrate storage to oil storage in
vegetative tissues. Enhancement of TAG synthesis in Arabidopsis is
achieved via up-regulation of the TAG biosynthesis pathway and
acyltransferase over-expression. This results in enhanced energy content
 of plant biomass by up to 6% without any detrimental effects in
Arabidopsis. Model experiments indicate that the plant material is
excellent forage, with animals fed the high-TAG material showing
increased weight gain. The increased energy density makes the biomass
particularly suited for pyrolysis.",

analytical chemistry procedures are very simple, routine steps that
potentially could be automated. For example, when performing a series of
 chemical separation steps, often the matrix of the sample needs to be
changed at the end of one separation before a sequential separation is
performed.  This matrix change typically involves evaporating the excess
 solution the sample is in to near dryness and then reconstituting the
sample in a new solvent matrix. This evaporation is done under
controlled conditions because of the need to carefully ensure the
solvent is fully evaporated while the solute product of interest is not
destroyed by overheating.  An automated dry-down instrument would be
very useful for this process to increase efficiency. Such a system would
 need to be compatible with various acid vapors (specifically to include
 HNO3, HCl, HF, and HClO4).  Important features are the sample
throughput and routing of off-gases  so as to be able to process large
numbers of samples (e.g., as many as 24, each of volume 0.1-10
milliliters) without cross contamination between them. Many of the
principles needed for successful implementation of an automated

 ground-based seismic, radionuclide, hydro-acoustic, and infrasound
technologies and systems to operational agencies to fulfill U.S.
monitoring requirements and policies for detecting, locating, and
identifying nuclear explosions (see Reference 1). Proposals that enhance
 U.S. capabilities that also benefit the international monitoring
capabilities in the context of preparations for a Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) may be submitted. \n\nResearch is sought
to move toward commercialization of algorithms, hardware, and software
that advance the state-of-the-art for event detection, location, and
identification. Superior technologies will help improve the Air Force
Technical Applications Centers (Reference 2) ability to monitor for
nuclear explosions, which are banned by several treaties and moratoria.
Grant applications responding to this topic must state (1) the current
state-of-the-art, in terms of relevant specifications such as
sensitivity, reliability, maintainability, etc., as well as the
performance goal of the proposed advance in terms of those same
specifications; and (2) address the commercialization path of any
instruments or components developed. Due to the small market potential
of treaty monitoring technologies, this call is focused toward already
existing or emerging commercial products for other applications that
could be modified-enhanced for treaty monitoring applications.  The
resulting treaty monitoring edition of the product(s) would hopefully
provide a performance advantage that would also benefit the original
market and thereby leverage existing markets.\n\nA near
zero-maintenance, manufacturable, whole-air gas compressor is needed to
improve gas collection technologies used in a variety of environmental
sampling applications and nuclear test-ban treaty monitoring
technologies.  There is a need for an ultra-high reliable whole air
compressor that can outperform all other commercially available
compressors in terms of regular maintenance and
Mean-Time-Between-Failure (MTBF).  Current compressors designs have
limited life operation before needing to be rebuilt or repaired.  No
commercially available compressors exist that can perform for years
without regular maintenance. This call for an ultra-high reliability
compressor is intended to get high performance prototypes transferred to
 a manufacturer where they can be produced to raise the state-of-the-art
 of commercially available units. Making these high performance units
commercially available to existing applications should also reduce the
cost of the high performance units.\n\nThe compressor must be capable of
 compressing ambient pressure whole air into a high-flow air stream and-
 or must be able to compress the gas into a high-pressure vessel. The
compressors must be designed so a common commercial entity can build the
 compressor without high cost special machining.  Finally, the
compressor must be able to run at 100% duty cycle with ambient
air-cooling and be able to maintain operation in high vibration
environments. The compressor must maintain adequate lubrication
throughout the life of usage.\n\nThe primary objective of this call is
to produce a compressor that meets the requirements of subtopic a. That
is, a successful proposal must be able to meet the minimum objectives of
 subtopic a. However, the stretch goal of this request is that that
compressor should be able to meet all the requirements in subtopic
subtopics a., b., and c. in a single compressor unit. The differences
between the three subtopics are variable flow rates, outlet pressure and
 power requirements. There are two outlet pressure requirements of 100
psig and 3000 psig between all three sections. Subtopics a. and b. have
outlet pressure requirements of 3000 psig and subtopic c has an outlet
pressure requirement of 100 psig. The low pressure compressor (100 psig,
 section c) flow rate must vary from 40 to 100 SLPM with a 220V power
requirement. It is conceivable to combine the objectives for the high
pressure and low pressure output requirements by only changing out the
compressor motor. \n\nThe stretch goal for the high pressure compressor
(3000 psig, subtopics a. and b.), is to achieve the variability in flow,
 from 2 SLPM to 500 SLPM, and pressures from 100 psig working pressure
to 3000 psig pressurization pressure while meeting the power requirement
 of 220V, 115V to 28VDC, as stated above, all within a single unit. This
 may be achieved with a change of the motor of similar size and
weight.",

and thermal spectral regions, obtained from the Stokes vector data,
provides advanced avenues for improving material identification.
Analysis of these data requires polarization signature models that
incorporate the effects of absorption, emission and scattering in the 3D
 atmospheric and terrain environment.  Although high fidelity, scalar,
1D atmospheric radiative transfer models are readily available [Berk et
al. 2006], few 1D polarization models [MODTRAN-P, vector-6S] have been
developed.  These 1D polarized models have significant limitations in
spectral coverage, computational speed, optical polarization databases,
and-or physics fidelity.  There are currently no available models that
treat all the polarized spectral signatures of key 3D scene elements
such as clouds, plumes, topographic backgrounds, and man-made objects in
 a self-consistent, unified approach.\nResearch is sought to develop a
validated 3D polarized atmospheric radiation transport model.\n\nThe
Phase I effort should focus (1) on assessing current 1D capabilities and
 available polarization databases, (2) on formulating approaches for
upgrades to the 1D models for a fully polarized implementation in Phase
II, (3) on designing a 3D polarization model, and (4) on planning
validation field measurements in collaboration with a DOE lab.  A
validated 3D polarized radiance model that incorporates the effects of
water clouds, plumes, natural terrain and turbid water backgrounds, and
both man-made and natural materials will be developed in Phase II.  The
new model will be tested against the existing 1D models and validated

Accelerator Program",
        "description": "The mission of the U.S. Muon Accelerator Program
 (MAP) is to develop and demonstrate the concepts and critical
technologies required to produce, capture, condition, accelerate, and
store intense beams of muons for Muon Colliders and Neutrino Factories
[1,2]. Current plans involve staged facilities beginning with neutrino
factories, possibly followed by a low energy collider (Higgs Factory),
and eventually leading to a multi-TeV energy collider. Muon-based
facilities have the potential to discover and explore new exciting
fundamental physics, but will require the development of demanding
technologies and innovative concepts. Grant applications are sought, as
described in greater detail below, related to the production of muon
beams, muon cooling, and rapid muon acceleration.\n\n1) 6D Cooling of
Muon Beams Utilizing Rectilinear channels: To meet the proposed Muon
Collider performance goals, 6D ionization cooling is required down to
transverse emittances of less than 0.3 mm-rad and longitudinal
emittances of approximately 2 mm. Rectilinear channels have been
proposed with demonstrated capability to achieve 6D cooling of muon
beams of both charge species simultaneously: a Helical FOFO Snake [3];
and a Rectilinear Planar Snake[4,5,6]. In both cases, plane parallel
absorbers are employed and cooling of both signs occurs simultaneously.
 The Helical FOFO lattice must be modified and scaled in order to meet
the above transverse emittance requirement. Scaling of the Planar Snake
lattice has been successfully demonstrated.\n\nGrant applications are
sought to examine in greater detail either of the referenced lattice
types. The magnet designs should be refined, including the use of
different conductor materials in areas with differing fields. Required
superconductor current densities should then be compared with published
conductor performances for the chosen geometry. Radial and other forces
and strains within the coils should be calculated, together with the
forces between the coils. In a second phase, the dimensions of
structures required to restrain these forces should be calculated, and
estimates made of the required specifications for such structures.
Estimates should also be made of specifications needed for thermal
isolation, rf feeds and other needed structures.\n\n2) Large Aperture
Kickers for Muon Cooling Rings:  A significant cost savings in both
capital construction and operations could be realized if cooling rings
could be employed in the cooling chain for a Muon Collider. The
injection and extraction systems for each ring will be challenging in
that the muon beams have large emittances especially at the beginning of
 the cooling chain.  Transverse emittances on the order of 1 to 5 mm-rad
 are expected; hence the kicker apertures must be larger than typical.
Several types of cooling rings [7,8,9] have been considered but all will
 require these technically advanced kickers.  Initial studies of the
necessary kicker parameters [10] have confirmed the basic challenge of
these kickers.  \n\nGrant applications are sought for both the design of
 kicker hardware and an accompanying pulsed power system.\n\n3)
R&amp;amp;amp;D for Rapid Acceleration of Muons- Dogbone RLA with
Multi-Pass Arcs: Recirculating Linear Accelerators (RLAs) are a fast,
compact and efficient way of accelerating lepton and possibly ion beams
to medium and high energies by reusing the same linac for multiple
passes, or to recycle the energy of the beam. In a conventional RLA, the
 different-energy passes coming out the linac are separated and directed
 into individual return arcs for recirculation. Thus, each pass through
the linac requires a separate fixed energy arc, increasing the
complexity, size, and cost of the RLA. A novel RLA concept involves
return-arc optics design based on linear combined function magnets with
variable dipole and quadrupole field components, which allows two
consecutive passes with very different energies to be transported
through the same string of magnets [11,12].\n\nGrant applications are
sought to develop a complete conceptual design for a scaled electron
model of such an RLA (i.e. a model developed by scaling a GeV muon
design for electrons yielding a machine that fits in a compact area).
Along with a conceptual design, a cost comparison to an alternative
separate-arc design should also be done. Proposals are also invited on
the conceptual engineering design of the above-mentioned multi-pass arc
magnets, capable of handling wide energy ranges, and related
systems.\n\n4) A Pulsed Dipole for Muon Beam Acceleration in an RCS:  A
Muon Collider will require final acceleration of muons to TeV-scale
energies.  For this purpose, a final acceleration stage based on a Rapid

Codes: Grant applications are sought to develop new or improved
computational tools for the design, study, or operation of
charged-particle-beam optical systems, accelerator systems, or
accelerator components. These tools should incorporate innovative
user-friendly interfaces, with emphasis on graphical user interfaces and
 windows, and tools to translate between standard formats of accelerator
 lattice description. Grant applications also are sought for the
conversion of existing codes for the incorporation of these interfaces
(provided that existing copyrights are protected and that applications
include the authors&amp;amp;apos; statements of permission where
appropriate).\n\n2) Improved Integration of Accelerator Codes:  Grant
applications also are sought for user-friendly tools in software
integration for different components including preprocessors and
postprocessors of existing codes or for different application codes into
 a framework to enhance simulation of accelerator systems[1].\n\n3)
Accurate Modeling and Prediction of High Gradient Breakdown Physics:
Grant applications also are sought to develop simulation tools for
modeling high-gradient structures, in order to predict such experimental
 phenomena as the onset of breakdown, post breakdown phenomena, and the
damage threshold.  Specific areas of interest include the modeling of:
(1) Surface emission, (2) Material heating due to electron and ion
bombardment, (3) Multipactoring, and (4) Ionization of atomic and
molecular species.  Approaches that include an ability to import-export
CAD descriptions, a friendly graphical user interface, and good data
visualization will be a plus.\n\n4) Software for Multi-Physics Modeling
of MAP Systems: In the past decade HEP-driven accelerator modeling codes
 have become increasingly sophisticated. Particularly noteworthy is the
fact that accelerator codes now combine multiple phenomena, such as
single particle nonlinear optics, space-charge effects, beam-beam
effects, and beam-material interactions. But there are some phenomena
that are important to the HEP mission that are still missing from
accelerator codes.\n\nGrant applications are sought for development and
deployment of codes and software modules that are important to HEP
projects and for which current capabilities do not exist or are not
sufficient. Regarding the simulation of MAPs muon cooling systems
[2,3,4], those based on gas-filled rf cavities require complex modeling
of the beam-plasma interaction [5]. Such processes are also expected to
be relevant to other advanced concepts involving beams and plasmas.
Proposals are sought for codes and modules to self-consistently model
the interaction of beams with plasmas, including beam-plasma
interactions in gas-filled rf cavities, plasma production by incoming
beams, and plasma and atomic physics processes. Proposals are also
sought for developing code capabilities for modeling collective effects
in matter, for modeling polarized muon processes, and for combining beam
 dynamics codes with neutrino interaction codes to accurately predict
neutrino radiation in a muon collider.",

other sciences); and (2) Cloud Computing, often referred to as elastic
computing, can offer a fast turn-around resource provisioning solution
to experiments via virtual machine containing an application-specific
computing environment, services and software stack.  Accordingly, there
is a need for compatible software distribution and installation
mechanisms that can be automated and scaled to the large numbers (100s)
of computing facilities distributed around the country and the globe
including platform independent applications as well as solution
supporting the provisioning of resources to multiple experiments at a
given site.  Grant applications are sought to (a) develop mechanisms and
 tools that enable efficient and rapid packaging, distribution, and
installation of nuclear physics application software on distributed
computing facilities such as the OSG and WLCG (b) design innovative
solutions for the apportion of resources and achieve resource sharing
between many experiments and groups both public and private Cloud
environments (c) seek to leverage industry standards such as the Hadoop
file system or MapReduce paradigm to enhance the capabilities of Cloud
stacks. Software solutions should enable rapid access to computing
resources as they become available to users that do not have the
necessary application software environment installed.",

Acquisition",
        "description": "Modern data acquisition systems are becoming
more heterogenous and distributed.  This presents new challenges in
synchronization of the different elements of this event-driven
architecture.  The building blocks of the data acquisition system are
digitizers, either flash digitizers or integrating digitizers of time,
pulse height or charge.  These elements respond in real-time to convert
electrical signals from detectors into digital form. The data from each
detector element is labeled with a precisely synchronized time and
transmitted to buffers.   The total charge, the number of coincident
elements or other information summaries are used to determine if
something interesting has happened, that is, forming a trigger.  If the
trigger justifies it, the data from the elements are assembled together
into a time-correlated event for later analysis, a process called Event
Building.  At present the elements tend to be connected by buses (VME,
cPCI), custom interconnects or serial connections (USB).  In certain
types of experiments at  FRIB, low event rates of 1 to 10 kevents-s are
anticipated, with dense data streams from FADC-based detector systems.
The large latencies possible in highly buffered flash ADC architectures
can be used to advantage in the design of the architecture.\n\n\nA
concept of the next generation data acquisition system is that it will
be ultimately composed of separate ADC&amp;amp;apos;s for each detector
element, connected by commercial network or serial technology.
Development is required to implement the elements of this distributed
data acquisition over commercially available network technologies such
as 10 Gb Ethernet or Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture
(ATC).  The initial work needed is to develop a software architecture
for a system that works efficiently in the available network bandwidth
and latencies.  The elements desired in the architecture are to (1)
synchronize time to a sufficient precision, as good as 10ns or better to
 support  Flash Analog-to-Digital Converter (FADC) clock
synchronization, 100ns or better to support trigger formation and event
building, (2) determine a global trigger from information transmitted by
 the individual components (3) notify the elements of a successful
trigger, in order to locally store the current information, (4) collect
event data from the individual elements to be assembled into events and
(5) software tools to validate the function of the synchronization,
triggering and event building during normal operation.  The
synchronization of time is critical to the success of this architecture,
 as is the constant validation of the synchronization.\n\nGrant
applications are sought for any of 1) development of the software
architecture that specifies a functional model for the individual
elements of the system, the high level network protocols, and
requirements on the communications fabric for given data rates and
system latencies, including a portable software implementation of the
elements of the architecture, 2) hardware modules to implement the
detector digitizer on Ethernet, and 3) time distribution protocols and
hardware to support this architecture.\n\nSuch an architecture and its
implementation could form the basis of a standard for next generation
data acquisition in nuclear physics, particularly at the FRIB",

Devices as imaging devices and cameras for visible light.  Several
laboratories are exploring the possibility of using such devices as
direct conversion particle detectors.  The charge produced by an
ionizing particle in the epitaxial layer is collected by diffusion on a
sensing electrode in each pixel.  The charge is amplified by a
relatively-simple low-noise circuit in each pixel and read out in a
matrix arrangement.  If successful, this approach would make possible
high-resolution, position-sensitive particle detectors with very low

components\n\nGrant applications are sought to develop beam absorbers
for energy-recovery linac driven medical isotope facilities. In such
facilities an energy-recovering electron beam interacts with a thin
high-Z target. After interaction with the thin target, the beam halo
generated must be deposited in a controlled way and absorbed downstream
of the target but before substantial bending for energy recovery. High
efficiency in beam absorption leads to higher electron beam current and
to higher possible overall production rates in the facility. \n\nLastly,
 grant applications are sought to develop software that adds

including modeling of cathode geometries for high current polarized
electron sources, (5) generating and transporting polarized electron
beam, (6) beam dynamics, transport and instabilities; and (7) electron

parallel-computing simulation techniques for the optimization of both
normal- and super-conducting accelerating structures for the future rare

interesting for realizing high-intensity low-energy beams of certain
elements and for the parasitic use of rare isotopes produced by
projectile fragmentation.  The development of suitable high-temperature
materials to achieve fast release of the stopped rare isotopes as atomic
 or single-species molecular vapor is required.\n\nGrant applications
also are sought to develop techniques for efficient rare isotope
extraction from water.  Water-filled beam dumps or reaction product
catchers, considered in the context of high-power rare isotope beam

 products stopped in the water.   \n\nGrant applications also are sought
 to develop techniques for the charge breeding of rare isotopes in
Electron Beam Ion Sources or Traps (EBIS-T) prior to reacceleration.
High breeding efficiencies in single charge states and short breeding

simulation tools will be needed that realistically describe electron-ion
 interaction and ion cooling mechanisms and use accurate electric and

development of radiation resistant, high-performance support links is

Radiation resistant multiple-use vacuum seals:  Elastomer-based vacuum

reliable supply of isotopes year-round and the reduced dependence on
foreign supplies.  Additional guidance for research isotope priorities

        "topic_name": "Improved Radiochemical Separation Methods for
Preparing High-Purity Radioisotopes",
        "description": "Separation from contaminants and bulk material
and purification to customer specifications are critical processes in
the production cycle of an isotope. Many production strategies and
techniques used presently rely on old technologies and-or require a
large, skilled workforce to operate specialized equipment, such as
manipulators for remote handling in hot cell environments.  Conventional
 separation methods may include liquid-liquid extraction, column
chromatography, electrochemistry, distillation or precipitation and are
used to separate radioactive and non-radioactive trace metals from
target materials, lanthanides, alkaline and alkaline earth metals,
halogens, or organic materials. High-purity isotope products are
essential for high-yield protein radiolabeling, for radiopharmaceutical
use, or to replace materials with undesirable radioactive emissions.
Improved product specifications and reduced production costs can be
achieved through improvements in separation methods. Of particular
interest are developments that automate routine separation processes in
order to reduce operator labor hours and worker radiation dose,
including radiation hardened semi-automated modules for separations or
radiation hardened automated systems for elution, radiolabeling,
purification, and dispensing. Such automated assemblies should be easily
 adaptable to different processes and hot cell use at multiple sites,
including the DOE laboratories currently producing radioisotopes.
\n\nAlthough, PET-style equipment (cyclotrons and fluid target systems)
using automated chemistry modules are increasingly available, they are
generally underutilized.  Employing this equipment to supplement
commercial production of PET products with additional newer
radioisotopes (e.g., Zr-89, Pb-203, Tc-94m), as well as, existing
radioisotopes (e.g., I-124, Cu-64, I-111) would be a synergistic and
efficient use of resources.  Applications are sought for developing
commercial methods similar to and compatible with existing commercial
PET production method.\n\nApplications are sought for innovative
developments and advances in separation technologies to reduce
processing time, to improve separations efficiencies, to automate
separation systems, to minimize waste streams, and to develop advanced
materials for high-purity radiochemical separations.  In particular, the
 Department seeks breakthroughs in lanthanide and actinide separations.
 Incremental improvements are also encourage, such as (1) in the
development of higher binding capacity resins and adsorbents for
radioisotope separations to decrease void volume and to increase
activity concentrations, (2) the scale-up of separation methods
demonstrated on a small scale to large-volume production level, and (3)
new resin and adsorbent materials with increased resistance to
radiation, and with greater specificity for the various elements.  \n
\nThe following are some new strategies for radioisotope processing and
separation technologies. In lanthanide radiochemistry, improvements are
sought to a) prepare high-purity samarium-153 by removing contaminant
promethium and europium; or b) to prepare high-purity gadolinium-148 and
 gadolinium-153 by ultra-pure separation from europium, samarium, and
promethium contaminants. Sn-117m has gotten a lot of interest in the
last few years.  It has favorable nuclear properties for both imaging
and therapy.  However commercial quantities of the isotope at high
specific activity are not available.  Supply of commercial quantities of
 high specific activity Sn-117m would be of high interest. Re-186 has
excellent nuclear properties for therapy and is chemically similar to
Tc-99m which is widely used for diagnostic imaging. Therefore, Re-186
could be used as a therapeutic matched pair for currently available
diagnostic imaging agents.  However, high specific activity Re-186 is
not available.  So, alternative methods of production or mass separation
 to remove stable Re isotopes, which can provide commercial quantities
of high specific activity Re-186 are highly desirable.  In actinide
radiochemistry, innovative methods are sought a) to improve
radiochemical separations of or lower-cost approaches for producing
high-purity actinium-225 and actinium-227 from contaminant metals,
including thorium, radium, lead, lanthanides, and-or bismuth; or b) to
improve ion-exchange column materials needed for generating lead-212
from radium-224, and bismuth-213 from actinium-225 and-or radium-225.
The new technologies must be applicable in extreme radiation fields that
 are characteristic of chemical processing involving high levels of
alpha-and-or beta--gamma-emitting radionuclides. \n\nRecent advances in
translation and clinical trials of alpha-particle mediated therapies
have focused attention on the production and purification of long lived
parent radionuclides for radium-223 and lead-212 production.  Regulatory
 approval for the treatment of metastatic bone cancer originating from
advanced prostate cancer using radium-223 dichloride has been obtained
from the US Food and Drug Administration and initial phase I clinical
trials of lead-212-TCMC-Trastuzumab for treatment of HER-2 expressing
carcinoma (e.g., ovarian, pancreatic, peritoneal), are currently being
conducted in the US.  However sufficient amounts of the parent isotopes
are not available to support full clinical implementation. Innovative
methods are sought for 1) the production of actinium-227 and
thorium-228, 2) the purification of actinium-227 and thorium-228 from
contaminating target materials and decay chain daughters, and 3) the
generation of high specific activity radium-223 and lead-212 for
clinical applications",

Announcement (FOA) solicits Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Fast Track grant applications that propose to test and\/or validate
novel, state-of-the-art candidate biomarker platforms for predicting
onset and progression of inflammatory diseases of interest to the NIAMS
and for determining the pharmacodynamics, safety and\/or efficacy of
therapeutic agents targeting those
diseases.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tImprovements in high-throughput genomics,
 proteomics, and metabolomics have significantly facilitated the
advancement of biomarker discovery, selection, and identification.
&amp;nbsp;Biomarker platforms, defined as a group of selected
biomarkers, assays to detect them, and algorithms to interpret results,
can integrate disease information from diverse pathways into
quantitative data for simple interpretation. The technology is expected
to be particularly useful in the evaluation of complex inflammatory or
metabolic diseases in which multiple pathways are involved. However,
these technological advances have not been translated into
state-of-the-art, well-validated biomarker platforms for inflammatory
diseases within NIAMS mission. &amp;nbsp;The use of biomarker platforms
in clinical studies of inflammatory diseases of interest to National
Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) has
been delayed by the lack of carefully conducted validation studies of
new or existing platforms in well-characterized clinical
cohorts.\n\n\tFor the purpose of this FOA, the NIAMS identifies four
distinct stages in the process of bringing biomarkers platforms to study
 diseases and therapies: initial screening, feasibility, development and
 validation. Candidate biomarkers may be identified during the initial
screening based, for example, on gene expression and protein array data,
 literature review and bio-informatics database searches. Feasibility
studies can be used to determine which biomarker candidate(s) have the
strongest association to disease activity and should include intensive
qualification of biomarkers detection assays. Development studies
generally include the final selection of top candidate biomarkers based
on the optimization of detection assays and development and verification
 of algorithms in a well-characterized clinical cohort and\/or specimen
collection. In the validation stage, the final algorithm should be
evaluated in a clinical cohort and\/or specimen collection different
from those used during feasibility or development studies. Validated
biomarker platforms are expected to be accurate, stable, reliable, and
sufficiently sensitive to measure inflammatory disease onset,
progression, and\/or therapy response.\n\n\tResearch Objectives\n\n\tThe
 NIAMS seeks biomarker platform research projects for inflammatory
diseases in the NIAMS mission focused on the following three
stages:&amp;nbsp; feasibility, development, and validation. New or
existing biomarker platforms may be used on body fluids and\/or tissue
specimens to predict disease onset and progression, to study
pharmacodynamics, or to determine therapeutic safety and\/or efficacy.
The SBIR Cooperative Agreement Fast-Track mechanism (U44) will be used.
Phase I studies must address biomarker platform feasibility, and Phase
II studies should be focused on further development and\/or clinical
validation. In cooperative agreements, the award recipient retains the
primary responsibility and dominant role for planning, directing, and
executing the proposed project, with NIAMS staff being involved as a
partner with the awardees. The SBIR projects should evaluate putative
biomarker platforms in already available, well-characterized clinical
cohorts and\/or specimen collections. Collaborative arrangements for use
 of specimen collections with repositories supported by voluntary
organizations, NIH-funded research centers (such as the NIAMS Skin
Disease Research Centers, Rheumatic Disease Research Centers, Centers of
 Research Translation, and Multidisciplinary Clinical Research
Centers&amp;nbsp;
http:\/\/www.niams.nih.gov\/Funding\/Funding_Opportunities\/activity_codes.asp#4&amp;amp;Research%20Programs%20and%20Centers%20(%20P%20
 ) or other institutional resources are recommended and encouraged. This
 FOA will not support feasibility (identification) studies of biomarker
candidates, the inception of new clinical cohorts or the collection of
new specimens. Biomarker screening and discovery projects will not be
considered responsive to this FOA. Applicants are highly encouraged to
contact NIAMS staff to discuss project responsiveness.\n\n\tInflammatory
 diseases of interest to NIAMS include, but are not limited to,
rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma,
psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata,
cicatricial and scaring alopecia, vitiligo, acne, rosacea, pemphigus,
and MYOSITIS.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExamples of biomarker candidate platforms
for feasibility, development and\/or validation studies include, but are
 not limited to:\n\n\t\n\t\tMetabolomics assays of disease progression
using tissue specimens in chronic autoimmune diseases of skin such as in
 cicatricial alopecia or rheumatic diseases such as
scleroderma.\n\t\n\t\tSelection of biomarker candidate platforms that
monitor and predict disease progression using samples obtained in
prospectively followed lupus, arthritis, or psoriasis patient
cohorts.&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tProteomic assays of therapeutic
pharmacodynamic biomarkers in skin or blood specimens from a clinical
cohort of patients with diseases such as lupus erythematosus or
myositis.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment and verification of algorithms of disease
 progression biomarkers in a clinical cohort of patients with diseases
such as psoriatic arthritis.\n\n",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Design, fabrication, and
demonstration of an electrophoretic capillary nanofluidic integrated
sensor platform effective for sequencing polypeptides. The goal is to
rapidly determine the amino acid sequence of a large polypeptide in a
non-destructive manner.     DESCRIPTION: Standard methods of proteomics,
 such as mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE, involve an extensive amount of
sample preparation that is usually performed in a well-equipped
laboratory. Such methods are very difficult to move to field
environments. Also, standard methods of proteomics involve fragmenting a
 protein into small peptides before analysis. Following analysis of the
smaller peptides, the researcher is required to reassemble the data to
determine the amino acid sequence of the original large protein. There
is a need in the DoD for rapid non-destructive methods of protein
analysis that have the potential for use in the field. Nanofluidic
analysis has emerged as a method to address this important problem.
Recently, methods have been developed to rapidly separate long-strand
polymers according to length. The separation mechanism utilizes
confinement-induced forces to separate the polymers into different size
fractions. Researchers have examined interfaces between regions of
vastly different configuration entropy, where small fragments can become
 trapped in favorable regions, but the larger fragments cannot
completely enter due to the large size. Researchers have also examined
mechanical and\/or field-induced dielectrophoretic trapping due to the
surface roughness within nanopores and selective binding of proteins and
 nucleic acids to silica particles.    Nanofluidics holds the promise
for rapid, inexpensive, non-destructive analysis of biopolymers. In
particular, nanofluidics may address rapid, non-destructive
determination of the amino acid sequence of a large polypeptide. A
better understanding of the transport behavior of long and short
biopolymer strands in nanochannels is required. Better reporter
mechanisms are also needed.     PHASE I: Examine the transport behavior
of large polypeptide strands in fused silica nanochannels with the
application of electrical fields of different strengths. Examine
mechanical and\/or field-induced dielectrophoretic trapping due to the
surface roughness within the nanochannels. Examine areas within the
nanofluidic channels with induced interfaces between regions of vastly
different configuration entropy. Examine methods for utilizing
polypeptide transport in nanochannels as a method for the
non-destructive determination of the amino acid sequence. Examine
methods of amino acid reporting, including optical and electrical
methods.    PHASE II: During Phase II, the offeror should build and test
 a functioning nanofluidic proteomics platform. The research and
development work should include an assessment of the prototype"s ability
 to analyze large polypeptides and report the amino acid sequence. The
nanofluidic proteomics system should allow for stand-alone operation
with fluidic and electrophoretic control that is self-sustained to
facilitate a transparent operation by the user, with the ultimate goal
of developing a system that can be used in a field environment. The
ultimate goal of the effort is to develop a system that is the size of a
 smart-phone that can operate on available battery power.  Analysis time
 will depend on the size of the polypeptide strand under analysis.
Target analysis time should be approximately 30 minutes.     PHASE III:
Further research and development during Phase III efforts will be
directed towards refining a final deployable design, incorporating
design modifications based on results from tests conducted during Phase
II, and improving engineering\/form-factors, equipment hardening, and
manufacturability designs to meet U.S. Army CONOPS and end-user
requirements to include the Joint Chemical and Biological Defense
Program (CBDP).     Specifically improved nanofluidic analysis will have
 relevance to scientific studies on biological materials and structures,
 to the detection and identification of biological threats, to medical
diagnostics of biological induced diseases, to the monitoring of
commercial consumables for biological contamination, just to name a few
possibilities.",

        "topic_name": "Thermal Infrared Detection of Aerosolized
Bacterial Spores",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a software package designed
for detecting and tracking biological aerosols using a thermal infrared
camera.    DESCRIPTION: In outdoor environments, biological aerosols
exhibit a Mie scattering component within the infrared signature of the
aerosol. The Mie scattering component is primarily due to the
reflectance of the cold sky by the aerosol particles. The Mie scatter
component is broadband extending into both the long-wave and mid-wave
infrared regions. To a thermal infrared camera, the presence of the
aerosol appears as an area of the thermal scene that appears slightly
colder than surrounding areas. Aerosol plumes can also be identified and
 tracked due to the motion of the plumes. The goal of this effort is to
develop software that can be used with existing thermal infrared cameras
 for the detection and tracking of biological aerosols. This system will
 be used to provide early warning to the soldier-in-the-field of an
attack by a biological warfare agent in an aerosolized form.
Uncooled long-wave-infrared cameras offer advantages in battlefield
environments. Uncooled IR sensors operating from 8 to 12 microns can
easily operate in bright sunlight or total darkness. They use the
naturally radiated IR scene energy to create high resolution images and
are not dependent on artificial light sources. Their long wave-length of
 operation also provides good weather penetration. Enemy vehicles and
soldiers can easily camouflage themselves in the visible, but have
difficultly hiding their thermal emissions from an IR imager. As thermal
 infrared cameras become readily available on the battlefield, there is a
 desire to provide them with additional operational capabilities.
PHASE I: Examine the feasibility of detecting and tracking biological
aerosols using a thermal infrared camera. Aerosol plume detection using
thermal infrared cameras is possible due to an atmospheric effect called
 Mie scattering. Down-welling radiation from the atmosphere is scattered
 off aerosol particles, causing an aerosol plume to appear as a cold
object against the surrounding background. A thermal camera with the
appropriate software should be able detect and track biological aerosol
clouds from a standoff distance of up to 5 km or better.  Detection
sensitivity should be 50,000 ACPLA or better for a plume size of 200
meters or larger with a probability of detection of at least 80%. A
preliminary design of a software package that can detect biological
aerosols from the scene of an infrared camera should be developed. A
performance model of the system should be developed to predict the
utility of the proposed system. Data acquisition and signal processing
of the proposed system should be examined and modeled.     PHASE II:
Develop a software package that can be used with existing thermal
infrared cameras for the detection and tracking of biological aerosols.
Advance the system design (with software package) and build\/optimize
for field usage. The final system should be able detect and track
biological aerosol clouds from a standoff distance of up to 5 km. The
system should function autonomously and be capable of real-time
detection and tracking of aerosol clouds. The software package should be
 implemented, tested, and demonstrated using a thermal infrared camera
platform.     PHASE III: Further research and development during Phase
III efforts will be directed toward refining and implementing the new
design software to meet U.S. Army CONOPS and end-user requirements to
include the Joint Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP). The
software package should be implemented and tested on a variety of
thermal infrared platforms that are of interest to the DoD.  The offeror
 should also consider the system design to include aerosolized chemical
agent detection, thus expanding its overall standoff detection
capabilities.     The new design software will have broad impact across
several avenues of defense applications. The fundamental mathematical
and computational methods developed in this program will also have an
impact. There are environmental applications for a robust standoff
biological aerosol sensor. A thermal infrared camera that can be used
for detecting biological aerosols will significantly reduce the
logistics burden on the Joint Services by reducing the number of sensors
 in the field. Also, first responders such as Civil Support Teams and
Fire Departments have a critical need for a rugged, inexpensive sensor
that can be transported to the field to test for possible contamination
by CBW agents.",

        "topic_name": "Secondary Processing Development and Prototyping
of Cast Single-Piece Vehicle",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and prototype highly
scalable processes to fabricate single-piece underbody structures to
achieve a combination of high strength and high toughness.
DESCRIPTION:  The Army is interested in the production of large
single-piece underbody structures for combat vehicles. The structure
must possess an outstanding combination of strength and toughness for it
 to survive battlefield threats. In general single-piece structures are
produced by casting and followed by subsequent secondary processing to
achieve the desired mechanical properties in the structure. It has been
demonstrated that a cast steel material after appropriate post-cast
secondary processing exhibits a combination of strength and toughness as
 high as 180 ksi tensile yield strength, 230 ksi ultimate tensile
strength, 12% tensile elongation, and 30 ft-lb Charpy V Notch (CVN)
toughness at -40 degrees F[1,2]. Unfortunately such remarkable
mechanical properties are achievable only in relatively small cast
structures. Suitable scalable secondary processing techniques are not
currently available which could be applied to large single-piece cast
structures to achieve the aforementioned mechanical properties. The
challenge here is to establish scalable secondary processes for very
large single-piece structure to achieve the required combination of
strength and toughness. Additional challenge is to achieve uniformity of
 the properties throughout the entire large single-piece structure
including through thicknesses.     Army is inviting proposals to develop
 and prototype highly scalable processes to fabricate large single-piece
 underbody structures with a combination of high strength and high
toughness throughout the entire structure and thickness. The process
must be scalable and be able to integrate relatively smoothly to very
large scale fabrication or production under the standard manufacturing
practices without needing nonconventional manufacturing equipments or
processes beyond what are currently used. Army is seeking proposals that
 address novel processing techniques, such as innovative casting, robust
 post-cast processing, or other equally innovative and robust processes,
 that can be easily integrated with the existing manufacturing bases to
enable smooth transition to large scale processing of large single-piece
 structure.    PHASE I:  Design processes to produce plates having
nominal dimension of 4 ft wide x 4 ft long x 3 in thick. Demonstrate
that the designed structure is able to achieve the Phase I threshold
properties of 180 ksi tensile yield strength, 230 ksi ultimate tensile
strength, 12% tensile elongation, and 30 ft-lb Charpy V Notch (CVN)
toughness at -40 degrees F. Two (2) 4 ft width x 4 ft length x 3 in
thickness plates meeting the aforementioned threshold properties shall
be produced. Verification and validation of the uniformity of the
properties throughout the entire structure is critical and one (1) of
the two (2) identically processed plates shall be destructively
evaluated accordingly following the ASTM standards [3-5]. Uniformity of
the properties throughout the entire plate including the thickness must
be evaluated. For example, it may be evaluated in x, y, and z reference
orientations within every 1 ft x 1 ft spacing in the x and y reference
orientation at two positions in the z-direction:  one at the mid-point
of the plate and the other half-way between the mid-point and the
surface. The plate not destructively tested shall be delivered to U.S.
Army Research Laboratory for blast tests. The secondary process design
preferably be suitable not only for processing simple structures but
also for processing complex shape large structures. Additionally, the
secondary process design must be sufficiently adaptable such that it can
 be directly integrated into the existing conventional manufacturing
infrastructures or foundry processes without needing nonconventional
manufacturing equipments or processes beyond what are currently
available and used commercially. Numerical methodologies in process
model and simulation are highly desirable in demonstrating the Phase I
secondary process predictability.     PHASE II:  The Phase II program
will be to scale up and optimize the process to produce larger plates
and subsequently to an entire single-piece vehicle underbody tub (i.e.,
lower hull and underbelly). Two (2) plates having nominal dimension of 6
 ft wide x 10 ft long x 3 in thick shall be fabricated and achieved the
same threshold properties of the Phase I. Verification and validation of
 the uniformity of the properties throughout the entire structure and
through the thickness is critical and one (1) of the two (2) identically
 processed plates shall be destructively evaluated accordingly following
 the ASTM standards [3-5]. Uniformity of the properties throughout the
entire plate and thickness must be evaluated. For example, it may be
sampled at every 2 ft in the x-y plane. The plate not destructively
tested shall be delivered to U.S. Army Research Laboratory for blast
tests. Following successful validation of the plate properties, one (1)
full single-piece vehicle tub (i.e., lower hull and underbelly) having
nominal dimension of 12 ft wide x 30 ft long x 5 ft high and thickness
between 2 in and 3 in shall be fabricated and delivered to U.S. Army
Research Laboratory for blast tests.     The process shall be validated
to be sufficiently predictable, adaptable, flexible, and robust such
that it can be directly integrated into the existing conventional
manufacturing infrastructures or foundry processes without needing
nonconventional manufacturing equipments or processes beyond what are
currently available and used commercially. Numerical methodologies of
Phase II processes shall be developed and the model and simulation shall
 be demonstrated to be highly predictable.    PHASE III:  The
manufacturing technology shall be transitioned to civil and military
sector applications. . Successful Phase II validation facilitates
immediate single-piece vehicle hull and cap fabrication, and integration
 of demonstrated technology. The manufacturing technology and force
protection capability information will be transitioned to both Tank
Automotive Research and Development (TARDEC) and Tank Automotive Command
 (TACOM) for immediate implementation and integration into existing and
future platform design and engineering efforts. Deliverables and
technical data packages (TDPs) resulting from this SBIR will support a
variety of Army PEOs and PMs in Army major acquisition programs. The
manufacturing technology to civilian application enable very-large-scale
 complex-shape cast structural part in ship hulls, transportation
vessels, and energy infrastructures where unnecessary joining are
critical design requirements.",

Channel Materials",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Design and develop radiation hardened

test the feasibility and scalability of these materials in technology.
  DESCRIPTION: The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Basic Research
 Program supports research on the basic science of radiation effects in
microelectronics and radiation hard microelectronic materials and
devices. Radiation hardened microelectronics are critical for future
Department of Defense (DoD) systems where devices are required to
function in high radiation environments. Environments with high levels
of ionizing radiation can cause both single event effects (SEE) and
total ionizing dose (TID) effects in sensitive microelectronics.
Furthermore, as device components continue to get smaller the aspects of
 the physics that are most important in describing the interaction of
radiation with these new materials are changing compared to the older
generations of electronic devices.    In order to ensure reliable
operation of DoD systems in the presence of ionizing radiation, as well
as enhance overall performance, developers must provide a means of
confirming the integrated circuits are hardened to radiation effects.
General performance criteria to be addressed include: ease of
integration into current CMOS manufacturing processes; weight; cost;
performance (resistance to SEE and TID) in radiation environment;
reproducibility.     Of specific interest are metal-oxides channel
materials, such as nanocrystalline ZnO thin films, which have recently
demonstrated significant potential for radiation hardness. Such devices
have recently attracted attention due their potential in high speed
circuits, microwave amplifiers, ultra-low power circuits, sensors, and
thin film circuits compatible with Si CMOS ICs.     PHASE I: 1) Identify
 and define potential metal-oxide microelectronic devices for radiation
hard electronics. 2) Provide a path forward for prototype design,
radiation testing, evaluation, and fabrication.    PHASE II: Develop,
fabricate, and validate these prototype components for their improvement
 in radiation resistance over conventional circuits, cost and weight
implications, reliability, and reproducibility. Develop a scalable
process and business plan to manufacture the microelectronic
component(s).     PHASE III: DUAL USE APPPLICATIONS: Successful product

        "topic_name": "Indirect Detection of Radiological and Nuclear
Threats by Non-atmospheric Effect Techniques",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Conventional means of detecting
radiological and nuclear threats (e.g., scintillator, semiconductor,
ionization detectors)  are limited by the range of the emitted particle
(i.e., gamma, neutron, alpha, beta) between the source and detector.  As
 an alternative to this constraint, we seek proposals to develop new
modalities or improve upon previously investigated concepts for locating
 or sensing radiological or nuclear threats  by means of indirect
signatures that utilize non-atmospheric effects.  While a heavy
investment has been and continues to be made in conventional detection
methods, this topic aims to complement those methods with additional or
improved capabilities.  Indirect signatures detection is a category that
 could include a number of modalities.  As such, specific capabilities
and parameters are difficult to identify; however, means are being
sought to extend the detection range, increase sensitivity, and\/or
reduce size\/weight\/cube beyond that of traditional detectors.
DESCRIPTION:  DTRA seaks to improve capabilities for detecting nulear
and radiological material of interest by innovative means.  A previous
SBIR solicitation, DTRA122-014, called for"the detection of a
radioactive material by means other than by the direct interaction of
gammas or neutrons emitted by the source."In addition to the persuit of
indirect detection of such sources, DTRA is now following-up with the
additional requirement that such detection be performed by means utizing
 non-atmospheric effects.       For the purposes of this topic,
atmospheric effects refers to the changes induced on atmospheric species
 from ionizing radiation that can be observed.  Examples include O3
production via radiolysis and N2 and NOX excitation by secondary
electrons.  It has been proposed that the detection of these species or
their spectral lines can indicate the presence of radiation.    As an
alternate approach, this topic seeks to locate or detect the presence of
 materials of interest by alternative means other than those indicated
by atmospheric effects.  As an example, in recent years several efforts
have been undertaken to investigate gravity gradiometric approachs for
detecting radiological material.  Other concepts investigated have
included RF and thermographic signatures.  It is envisioned that this
will most likely occur by observing physical or chemical characteristics
 of radioactive material (e.g. density, temperature, acustic) or their
non-atmospheric effects of the surrounding environment.    PHASE I:
Development of the proof-of-concept through a laboratory device\/setup
or equivalent environment for the capability of locating or detecting
radiological or nuclear material of interest or other strong indicators
such as shielding material or configurations.  In this phase, the
proof-of-concept must be able to show that further development is likely
 to lead to a product with one or more capabilities that improve
operational utility beyond current COTS detectors.  A design concept for
 a prototype will be delivered and an evaluation of its feasibility and
utility will be a key decision point for continuation to Phase II.
PHASE II:  Phase II must develop a prototype detector that can be
validated independently.  The results should be quantitatively compared
to those of existing technologies in the same environments.  Relative
cost\/benefit studies should be performed to demonstrate the advantages
of the new technology.  The Phase II final report should include a
development plan and partnering approach for follow-on production and
fielding along with a roadmap that takes the development through Phase
III.    PHASE III:  Explore marketing and production alliances with
existing technology equipment firms that currently have market share in
these various commercial markets and under the prevue of export
restrictions that may apply.  For the military applications, continue
the development of the technology and equipment design so that it can be
 transitioned to a counter-WMD program of record.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  DTRA seeks a 3He-free portable
neutron detector with spectroscopic capability and directional
sensitivity, derived from measurement of count rates within a highly
granular array of thermal neutron detectors dispersed within a
moderator.  The device will be able to detect, locate and characterize
threat neutron sources in the field.    DESCRIPTION:  Neutron
spectroscopy can offer a significant advantage in the detection and
characterization of Special Nuclear Materials (SNM), when compared to
gross counting neutron detectors.  The energy of incident neutrons can
be used to characterize the source (fission neutrons vs. background),
identify the level of moderation, or the source distance.  A class of
detectors has been proposed that consist of granular arrays of thermal
neutron detectors distributed in a regular pattern within moderator.
Such detectors can measure the detailed spatial distribution of neutron
detections within the moderator and thereby achieve spectroscopic
classification as well as directional information.  In order to achieve
such measurements up to energies of 20 MeV rather large moderators and
detection volume is required.  Detection systems thus far proposed for
this application, either scintillator based neutron scatter camera or
solid state neutron detector based neutron spectrometer, limit the size
and thus energy and directional response of the instruments because of
their high cost and electronic complexity.  This topic seeks
detector\/moderator\/electronic solutions that can readily support the
field requirements of DTRA.  A successful design will address the need
for portability and affordable cost, while achieving high detection
efficiency for fission neutrons, sufficient energy resolution and
directional sensitivity.         PHASE I:  Develop the design of
a3He-free neutron detector capable of spectroscopy and 3-dimensional
position encoding.  The detector must be sensitive in the full energy
range from thermal up to 20 MeV, covering the range of threat fission
sources.  Energy discrimination must be adequate to distinguish fission
sources from higher energy sources used frequently in commerce such as
AmBe sources.  The direction of threat sources must be shown to be
achievable with an angular resolution of 5-10 degrees.  Complete
modeling studies to demonstrate that the instrument to be constructed in
 Phase II will achieve these requirements.  In addition to modeling
studies, construct and demonstrate a subscale system.  Conduct testing
of this system response to 252Cf and AmBe sources, demonstrating the
ability to distinguish the two sources and to grade the level of source
moderation by shielding of the sources with HDPE of progressive
thickness. Conduct directional testing to determine feasibility of
achieving the required angular sensitivity in the Phase II instrument.
Develop electronics to demonstrate feasibility of achievement of a low

        "topic_name": "Alternative Materials for Tactical Vehicle
Wheeled Hubs",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The MTVR is the current medium
tactical cargo vehicle for the Marine Corps. Efforts have been made to
reduce the weight of the vehicle, to accommodate extra cargo, to
accommodate up-armor kits, and to improve vehicle handling. One area of
development is an innovative, advanced material system to replace the
currently used mild to medium strength steel in the wheel hubs of the
Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR). Currently, the un-sprung
weight of the vehicles (the combined weight of all the vehicle hardware
not supported by the suspension) is on the order of 3500 lbs.  By
reducing this weight, the MTVR could gain improved handling
characteristics, improved fuel economy and an increase in cargo
capacity.    DESCRIPTION: The Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR)
 Program is the current medium tactical cargo vehicle for the Marine
Corps (Ref 1). Efforts are being made to identify areas that could
benefit from a reduction in weight to enable extra cargo carrying
capacity (e.g. up-armor kits, etc.) as well as improve vehicle handling
capability. A reduction in vehicle weight directly equates to an equal
increase in the vehicle load capacity. Currently used wheel hubs are
made of mild to medium strength steel and the entire assembly (tire and
hub) can weigh on the order of 550lbs each. The current wheel hubs are a
 two-piece bolt together steel disc design.  They are 20 x 10 in. hubs
that are sized to mount 16.00R20 XZL Michelin tires (Ref. 1).  One area
of potentially significant weight reduction in existing vehicles is in
the wheel hubs. Reducing the weight of the wheel hubs by making them out
 of a lighter weight advanced material will directly benefit the
handling capability of the vehicle by significantly reducing the
un-sprung weight of the vehicle. The reduced wheel weight would also
translate into better vehicle handling by providing improved wheel
acceleration. The weight reduction would also improve the vehicle fuel
efficiency (when the vehicle is not filled to maximum cargo capacity). A
 35% reduction in hub weight may be able to achieve a 3% increase in
fuel efficiency. The current state-of-the-art technology utilizes
composite technologies which have been applied to wheels for bicycles,
motorcycles and race cars. These wheels are primarily meant for
relatively light vehicles used on paved surfaces for non-high-impact
loads (Ref. 2-4). By contrast, a wheel hub for an MTVR will need to be
capable of supporting up to 10,000 lbs. static vehicle load and
operating in a more aggressive operating environment (Ref 1).     This
topic seeks to explore innovative, alternative, advanced material
systems to replace mild to medium strength steel used in the wheel hubs
for the MTVR. The use of composite material systems are encouraged, but
approaches are not limited to these types of advanced material systems.
Concepts that can provide a weight savings of up to 35% over the
currently used steel hub assembly are of a particular interest.
Proposers are encouraged to address the benefits of tailorable material
solutions so that the hubs could potentially be"tuned"to work with a
specific vehicle suspension. The MTVR is expected to operate in a
variety of environments and terrains. The hubs need to be able to
operate in the temperature range of 125 deg F to -50 deg F. Proposed
concepts should be mindful of the added technical challenges to be able
to maintain a"mean miles between mission"hardware failure metric of no
less than 2700 miles. The hubs will also need to maintain the current
Central Tire Inflation System (CTIS) capability as is discussed in Ref. 1
 and will need to conform to FMVSS 119, 120, FMCSR 393.75, SAE J267, SAE
 J1095, SAE J1992, SAE J2014, and applicable Tire and Rim Association,
or European Tire and Rim Technical Organization (ETRTO) standards.
PHASE I: The company will develop e concepts for an improved wheel hub
by exploring the application of advance materials while meeting the
required size and strength requirements for an MTVR as discussed above.
The company will demonstrate the feasibility of the concepts in meeting
the Marine Corps needs and will establish that the concepts can be
developed into a useful product for the Marine Corps. Feasibility will
be established by material testing and analytical modeling, as
appropriate, to facilitate the comparison of different concepts to
include projected performance, reliability, and maintainability. The
contractor shall estimate hardware, installation and maintenance costs.
The company will provide a Phase II development plan with performance
goals and key technical milestones, and that will address technical
risks.    PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II
development plan, the company will develop full-sized prototypes with a
scaled level of performance (initial testing will evaluate on-road
performance only.) The prototype hubs will be evaluated to determine
their capability in meeting the reduced scale performance goals defined
in the Phase II development plan and the Marine Corps requirements for
the MTVR. System performance will be demonstrated through on-vehicle
prototype evaluation and modeling or analytical methods as a means of
validating the performance, reliability and maintainability of the
prototypes. Evaluation results will be used to refine the prototype into
 an initial design that will meet MTVR requirements. The company will
prepare a Phase III development plan to transition the technology to
MTVR use.    PHASE III: If Phase II is successful, the company will be
expected to support the Marine Corps in transitioning the technology for
 Marine Corps use. The company will develop a wheeled hub for evaluation
 to determine its effectiveness in an operationally relevant
environment. The company will support the Marine Corps for test and
validation to certify and qualify the system for Marine Corps use. A
successfully developed wheel hub alternative will follow a dual
transition path. Some systems will be integrated onto MTVRs that are
deployed in mission areas that would immediately benefit from reduced
vehicle weight, while the overall system design will transition into the
 MTVR program as new vehicles continue to be produced.    PRIVATE SECTOR
 COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: The need to save vehicle
weight exists on many industrial vehicles, including agricultural,
mining, and construction equipment. Additionally, commercial freight
vehicles could benefit from a system that reduces wheel assembly and
vehicle weight.",

        "topic_name": "Adaptive Diesel Engine Control",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to reduce the volume
 of fuel consumed by the MTVR engine during mission operations by 15-25%
 over current fuel consumption while increasing the power output of the
engine by 5-10% over current engine rated capability.  These goals will
be reached thru modification of the Caterpillar C12 or similar engine
enabling full and independent control of diesel engine components
allowing the engine to operate at maximum efficiency across the full
spectrum of engine loads.    DESCRIPTION: Since the initial inception
and fielding of the Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR), the
expected mission of the truck has evolved (Ref. 1). Vehicle
modifications have included the addition of a larger alternator to
support a greater array of onboard electronics and increased equipment
loads, as well as increased vehicle weight due to up-armoring. These
modifications have required the truck engine to operate at two different
 load levels. First, the engine must operate at high-power, calling on
over 400 BHP to climb slopes, accelerate under full payload, or traverse
 soft soils. Second, the engine must operate for long periods of time at
 a low capacity while the vehicle is parked to support generation of
electricity and HVAC functions in the cab drawing 10  20 BHP. The MTVR
currently uses a Caterpillar C-12 electronic control, Adam III Diesel
engine. The C-12 Diesel engine is an inline 6 cylinder turbo charged
diesel truck engine with 729 in3 of displacement. The C-12 Diesel engine
 operates over a range of 1200 to 2100 RMP and provides a maximum of 425
 BHP at 1600 RPM, and provides a maximum of 1550 LB-FT of torque at 1200
 RPM. Control over the diesel combustion cycle is currently limited by
the mechanical linkage between engine rotation, valve actuation and fuel
 injection. Current state of the art controls only allow the engine to
be optimized for maximum fuel efficiency (minimization of power out per
mass of fuel consumed) at a single operational point (Torque versus
engine speed) (Ref. 2). Optimization of a single operation point does
not meet the need of current MTVR operational practices. Concepts that
remove the mechanical linkage could allow greater control over the
combustion cycle and are of particular interest (Ref. 3). Increased
combustion cycle control could allow adaptation of control strategies
that responds to engine load demands. This adaptation will result in
multiple optimized fuel efficiency operational points for the engine.
These multiple operating points may be achieved thru cylinder shut down,
 fuel injection profile shaping or other means made possible by higher
levels of combustion cycle control.     The MTVR program is interested
in innovative approaches to provide maximum engine control adaptability
of the C12 or similar engines to the loads required during various
engine operating conditions. The goal of this topic is to reduce the
volume of fuel consumed by the MTVR engine during mission operations by
15-25% over current fuel consumption while increasing the power output
of the engine by 5-10% over current engine rated capability.  Proposers
are encouraged to explore both hardware and control software
modifications. All modifications will be compatible, mechanically and
electronically, with existing MTVR drive systems components and not
compromise the MTVR"s current environmental operation requirements. All
vehicles and their components shall be capable of operating in the
temperature range of 52 degrees C (125 degrees F) to -32 degrees C (-25
degrees F) without the use of Arctic kits or additional operator
procedures, and to -45.5  degrees C (-50 degrees F) with the use of
Arctic kits. At ambient temperatures of -32 degrees C (-25 degrees F)
and above, the engine shall be capable of starting, reaching and
maintaining normal coolant temperature range, and attaining smooth
operation at idle speed within thirty (30) minutes with the operator
inside the cab, without external devices and with the transmission in
neutral. All variants shall be capable of being stored at 66 degrees C
(150 degrees F) without damage.     PHASE I: The company will develop
concepts to enable maximum adaptability of the current C12 or similar
engines to be able to efficiently adapt to varying load requirements as
dictated during the performance of its mission. The company will
demonstrate the feasibility of the concepts in meeting MTVR needs and
will establish that the concepts can be developed into a useful product
for the Marine Corps. Feasibility will be established by analytical
modeling, as appropriate. The company will also perform an analysis of
potential effects on existing systems reliability, maintainability and
durability. The company will provide a Phase II development plan with
performance goals and key technical milestones and that will address
technical risk reduction. The contractor will propose engine hardware
modification and control software development required to provide
maximum adaptability of the engines operating cycle to requested engine
work.    PHASE II: Based upon the results of Phase I and the Phase II
development plan, the small business will develop a scaled prototype for
 evaluation in a representative environment. The prototype will be
evaluated to determine its capability in meeting the performance goals
defined in the Phase II development plan and the MTVR requirements as
stated above. System performance will be demonstrated through prototype
evaluation and modeling or analytical methods over the required range of
 parameters and will also include engine dynamometer testing to
demonstrate fuel consumption improvements. Evaluation results will be
used to refine the prototype into an initial design that will meet
Marine Corps requirements. The company will prepare a Phase III
development plan to transition the technology to MTVR use.    PHASE III:
 If Phase II is successful, the company will be expected to support the
Marine Corps in transitioning the technology for MTVR use. The company
will develop a final prototype for evaluation to determine its
effectiveness in an operationally relevant environment such as an
over-the-road demonstration. A final MTVR modification kits and
instructions will be developed. A final kit production verification test
 and operational test would be performed to verify equipment install
process and performance. The modification kit would then be available
for application to the MTVR fleet. The company will support the Marine
Corps for its test and validation to certify and qualify the system for
MTVR use.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS:
 The commercial diesel industry has a need for higher level control of
the diesel combustion process in order to increase operational
efficiency for diesel engine applications. These applications include,
but are not limited to, commercial trucking, power generation, mining
and agriculture. Commercial trucks operate under a wild variety of
engine loads based on payload weight the vehicle is carrying, as well as
 overnight idle operation during driver rest periods on long hauls.  In
the power generation industry, diesel engines powering generators could
self-adjust to the load required on the generator and mitigate the need
for large battery packs to load level generation.  Finally, in the
agricultural industry, diesel engines are used in a wide variety of
equipment typically used for multiple functions during a season; the
adaptable engine will again allow the engine to adjust to the required
load for a given task.",

        "topic_name": "Development of On-board Weight and Center of
Gravity Measurement System for Tactical Vehicles",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this effort is to
develop an innovative, cost-effective and reliable on-board weight and
center of gravity (W &amp; CG) measurement system for tactical vehicles.
    DESCRIPTION: Tactical wheeled vehicles routinely carry payloads of
varied configurations to support the operating forces"diverse missions.
 To ensure safety while maximizing payload capacity, it is imperative
that the system weight and center of gravity (W &amp; CG) be accurately
and conveniently determined.   During transport, appropriate W &amp; CG
need to be maintained to avoid overloading a vehicle"s axles or lift and
 tie-down restraints.   Similarly, W &amp; CG data is necessary to
preserve a vehicle"s dynamic stability during operation.  As an example,
 the vehicle"s W &amp; CG, particularly vertical and lateral CG, need to
 stay below a certain limit to prevent rollover or braking failure.
Additionally, for a vehicle equipped with a stability control or warning
 system, accurate W &amp; CG data are required for the system to
function effectively.  Current methods to determine W &amp; CG for
tactical vehicles involve the use of truck scales, weight tables, and
suspension methods for CG.  However, these are not field-expedient and
often inconvenient if not inaccurate or incomplete.  Truck scales, for
instance, are not readily available to the operating forces except at
selected ports or maintenance facilities.  The scales alone also do not
provide vertical and lateral CG.  Computing a system"s W &amp; CG using
literature is limited by the availability of highly specific data on a
respective system"s CG as well as the relative positions of payloads.
The later may need to be measured on-site.   Suspension or other similar
 methods to determine CG typically have to be carried out by skilled
technicians in a properly instrumented facility, e.g., Aberdeen Test
Center.  These currently available methods limit the availability of
reliable W &amp; CG data, which greatly affects the Marines"ability to
safely optimize payloads.      Presently, technologies exist that could
effectively automate the collection of some W &amp; CG data.
Commercially available systems such as Onboard Truck Scales (Ref 1)
offer to provide on-demand weight information using a network of
pressure or strain sensors attached to a vehicle"s suspension system.
More advanced systems, such as those proposed for on-board aircraft
weight and balance apparatus (Ref 2) could, in addition to weight,
compute longitudinal and lateral CG using additional load and incline
sensors along with a suitable computer algorithm.   For vertical CG,
which remains challenging to measure, there are potential approaches
that involve using dynamic input, e.g., system axial accelerations, and
analyzing system modal frequencies (Ref 3).  These advances present
opportunities to develop a novel and effective W &amp; CG measurement
system; however, considerable technical challenges remain.  Most
notably, on-board CG measurement technology, particularly for vertical
CG, is still in early stage of development and primarily intended for
aircraft use.  More research and development are needed to fully mature
or expand these concepts, and adapt them to military vehicle
applications.      The US Marine Corps seeks innovative approaches
toward the development of an on-board system to measure weight and
longitudinal, lateral, and vertical CG of tactical vehicles (Ref. 4-5).
 Proposed concepts should include necessary hardware, software, and user
 interface to enable automatic, real-time or near real-time capturing
and reporting of W &amp; CG.  The measured W &amp; CG should be within
3% of the vehicle actual W &amp; CG.  Additionally, the research and
development should address system robustness against military vehicles
environmental and operational conditions (Ref. 4-5)  Proposals that
address a low maintenance and acquisition cost, simplicity in design and
 operation, employ open architecture design principles, and demonstrate
as ease of integration into the host vehicle are of a particular
interest.    PHASE I: The company will develop concepts for an on-board W
 &amp; CG measuring system for tactical vehicles.  Using a Medium
Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR, Ref 4-5) as the baseline platform,
demonstrate analytically and\/or experimentally the system can
automatically measure and report the vehicle"s weight and center of
gravity in real or near-real time.  Provide a Phase II development plan
with performance goals and key technical milestones, and that will
address technical risk reduction.    PHASE II: Based on the results of
Phase I and the Phase II development plan, develop a detailed design and
 performance specification.  Fabricate a prototype system and
demonstrate experimentally that target performance is met at different
payload configurations.  Demonstrate experimentally that the prototype
system can withstand the vehicle specified environmental and operational
 conditions.  Evaluation results will be used to refine the prototype
into an initial design that will meet Marine Corps requirements.
Prepare a Phase III development plan to transition the technology to
Marine Corps use.    PHASE III: If Phase II is successful, the company
will be expected to support the Marine Corps in transitioning the
technology for Marine Corps use.  Collaborate with government and
industry partners to produce and integrate the W &amp; CG system in a
tactical vehicle (MTVR) for evaluation to determine its effectiveness in
 an operationally relevant environment.   Demonstrate manufacturability
and cost reduction.  Support the Marine Corps for test and validation to
 certify and qualify the system for Marine Corps use.    PRIVATE SECTOR

        "topic_name": "Efficient Quantum Frequency Conversion for
Advanced Optical Communications",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Conceive and develop methods and
techniques for substantially improving the performance of optical signal
 processing in nonlinear optical devices. Of particular interest is
developing technologies suitable for quantum information processing such
 as near-100%-efficient quantum frequency conversion. Areas for
development include achieving nonlinear processes with precisely
tailored phase-matching spectra, reducing power requirements for driving
 such processes, developing single and few spatial-mode waveguides with
ultralow level of background noise, reducing end-to-end loss, and robust
 packaging of devices with input and\/or output fiber coupling.
DESCRIPTION: Frequency conversion that preserves the quantum states of
the converted signals, i.e., the so-called"quantum frequency
conversion"(QFC), has found numerous applications due to its ability to
manipulate coherent or nonclassical state light. For example, advanced
optical communications applications, including single-photon quantum
communications and quantum information processing for provably secure
data links, can benefit from operation in both the visible\/near- IR
wavelengths (400800 nm) and the telecommunications C-band (15301565 nm).
 Visible and near-IR wavelengths enable coupling to atomic systems \/
quantum dots (e.g., for quantum memory) and detection via fast,
high-efficiency, room-temperature single-photon detectors; but,
unfortunately, visible\/near-IR photons cannot be transmitted over long
distances through single-mode fiber. C-band photons can be transmitted
over long distances with extremely low loss using the existing
single-mode fiber telecommunications grid, but can be neither coupled to
 atomic systems nor easily detected. In principle, QFC provides the
ideal solution: coherent transfer between visible photons (for photon
processing, storage, and detection) and telecommunications photons (for
long-haul transmission through fiber). Perfecting this technology could
bridge the distance gap that limits the state-of-the-art in provably
secure communications, thus opening the door for a revolutionary
capability for the DoD. Thus far, QFC has been demonstrated in various
nonlinear optical media, such as crystals, waveguides, microresonators,
and optical fibers. In such systems, quasi-phase matching (QPM) has been
 an enabling technology to allow efficient nonlinear interactions to be
designed over a large wavelength span. In nonlinear crystals or
waveguides, QPM is usually achieved via periodic poling, whereas in
nonlinear microresonators, it can be realized utilizing the modal
dispersion of the cavity modes. While some applications of QPM have
become commercialized, others are emerging that place more stringent
requirements on device fabrication and processing. For example, QFC may
prove to be important for a host of quantum information processing
applications [1]. For some such applications it would be advantageous to
 obtain a narrow phase matching peak, enabling a potential direct
interface to quantum memory, for example. On the other hand, a broad
phase matching bandwidth is useful when up-converting a high-rate
single-photon channel since it allows the channel to be time-multiplexed
 to multiple detectors by exploiting multi-wavelength pumps [2]. In
addition to reaching higher speed performance, such a system allows high
 efficiency Si avalanche photodiode (APD) single-photon counters to be
used at a wider variety of wavelengths, including the telecom bands
where single-photon counters tend to have poor efficiency, limiting the
reach of quantum communications. Optical up- conversion with a tunable
laser followed by Si APDs can also be used to build an extremely
sensitive spectrometer [3]. In such a case a narrow band single phase
matching peak is highly desirable because a narrow band leads to higher
resolution while a single peak reduces unwanted cross talk. Quantum
applications are in general highly sensitive to very small (i.e., single
 photon) light leakage levels from scattering processes such as Raman
scattering [4]. Moreover, quantum systems are particularly sensitive to
loss but most waveguide based frequency converters have significant
(&amp;gt;3dB) loss especially when coupled to standard optical fibers.
In addition to quantum applications, classical applications in
instrumentation are also emerging such as measuring the jitter of
attosecond optical pulses [5]. Such applications can benefit from
waveguides that support dual polarizations and Type-II nonlinear
interactions. Type-II phase matching can also be employed for pre-
screening waveguides prior to poling to improve yield and uniformity
[6]. These emerging applications demand a new generation of nonlinear
waveguides with different and more stringent performance metrics. Thus
it is of great practical importance that these new waveguides can be
made with high yield, so the cost is not a limiting factor. Innovative
solutions are sought to the problem of robust quantum frequency
conversion. Successful solutions should simultaneously address all of
the following critical technological challenges. (1) Low loss. Nonlinear
 waveguides are limited by coupling loss (from single-mode fiber for the
 C-Band signal, to single-mode fiber or free space for the visible
signal), insertion loss (to and from the waveguide itself) and
transmission loss (per unit length) through the frequency conversion
medium; the net loss from all sources limits device performance and it
is this net loss that should be compared to program milestones. (2)
Ability to tailor the phase-matching bandwidths as detailed above. (3)
Wavelength selectability. A completely successful solution should
provide the flexibility to couple any wavelength in the visible\/near-IR
 to any wavelength in the C-band. Note that this flexibility need not be
 in real time, but should instead reflect a flexibility in the
fabrication process that allows any one device to be tailored for any
two specific wavelengths. For high-energy photons near 400-nm, multiple
stage frequency conversion may be required. (4) Efficiency. The
waveguide nonlinearity should be sufficiently strong to provide near
100%-efficient coherent (entanglement-preserving) frequency conversion.
(5) Robustness and portability. The ultimate goal of this SBIR is to
develop a packaged, robust, portable, room-temperature technology that
can be inserted into an existing system. PHASE I: Develop a detailed
computer model for the performance of a quantum frequency conversion
technology which fulfills all of the above requirements. Perform a
detailed simulation and preliminary experimental evaluation of end-
to-end device performance, and predict the technology"s loss, noise,
speed, wavelength flexibility, efficiency, and robustness under a
variety of realistic conditions and for the target wavelengths (400800
nm and 15301565 nm). A plan for reducing end-to-end losses from all
sources to&amp;lt;1.5 dB should be identified. The impact of Raman
photons shall be considered and methods to achieve low noise shall be
identified. Based on the simulation results, each team should make
quantitative predictions about PHASE II and PHASE III device performance
 in each of the five categories listed above. Using these predictions,
establish appropriate PHASE II technical milestones on a six-month (all
milestones must include a quantitative target) incremental basis. PHASE
II: Construct prototype devices whose end-to-end performance effectively
 demonstrates the contractor's technical approach. Using these devices,
test all PHASE I predictions for device performance. In particular,
singly peaked phase matching bandwidths of&amp;lt;0.2 nm must be
demonstrated. Losses and scattering effects must be minimized making the
 devices suitable for quantum applications, possibly those in a cascaded
 environment. Low end-to-end losses (&amp;lt;1.5 dB) through the
nonlinear material must be demonstrated. Methods to maintain acceptable
yields must also be developed. After characterizing the prototype
devices, further refine and extend the PHASE I models. Finalize a design
 for a production system capable of delivering tailored devices as final
 products, and use the refined models to predict the performance of the
second-generation (PHASE III) devices. PHASE II deliverables will
include device prototypes operating in multiple operational regimes
(e.g., at different source and target wavelengths), intermediate reports
 quantifying progress towards fulfilling the proposed technical
milestones, and a final report summarizing all simulations, models,
device designs, quantitative predictions for PHASE III device
performance, and proposed quantitative milestones for PHASE III. PHASE
III: Secure optical communications are critical to both the DoD mission
and to many commercial systems. DARPA is currently funding a major
effort to create macroscopic quantum communications systems capable of
combining quantum security with classical telecommunications speeds and
distances (The QUINESS Program). Deployment of this technology will
require exactly the type of robust frequency conversion devices
described in this SBIR. More broadly, any sensing or communications
system which requires detection of ultra-low levels of
telecommunications-band radiation will benefit from a frequency
conversion technology that enables use of superior visible-light
single-photon detectors. The new breed of nonlinear frequency conversion
 is foreseen to be used in a variety applications including single
photon detection for quantum information or lidar, and classical
measurements such as low photon spectroscopy or highly accurate laser
pulse jitter measurements.",

        "topic_name": "Defense Against National Vulnerabilities in
Public Data",
        "description": "This topic is eligible for the DARPA Direct to
PHASE II Pilot Program. Please see section 7.0 of the DARPA instructions
 for additional information. To be eligible, you must submit
documentation which demonstrates that Phase I feasibility (as described
in PHASE I below). Offerors must choose between submitting a PHASE I
proposal OR a Direct to Phase II proposal, and may not submit both for
the same topic. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the national security threat
posed by public data available either for purchase or through open
sources. Based on principles of data science, develop tools to
characterize and assess the nature, persistence, and quality of the
data. Develop tools for the rapid anonymization and de-anonymization of
data sources. Develop framework and tools to measure the national
security impact of public data and to defend against the malicious use
of public data against national interests. DESCRIPTION: The
vulnerabilities to individuals from a data compromise are well known and
 documented now as"identity theft."These include regular stories
published in the news and research journals documenting the loss of
personally identifiable information by corporations and governments
around the world. Current trends in social media and commerce, with
voluntary disclosure of personal information, create other potential
vulnerabilities for individuals participating heavily in the digital
world. The Netflix Challenge in 2009 was launched with the goal of
creating better customer pick prediction algorithms for the movie
service [1]. An unintended consequence of the Netflix Challenge was the
discovery that it was possible to de-anonymize the entire contest data
set with very little additional data. This de-anonymization led to a
federal lawsuit and the cancellation of the sequel challenge [2]. The
purpose of this topic is to understand the national level
vulnerabilities that may be exploited through the use of public data
available in the open or for purchase. Could a modestly funded group
deliver nation-state type effects using only public data? The threat of
active data spills and breaches of corporate and government information
systems are being addressed by many private, commercial, and government
organizations. The purpose of this research is to investigate data
sources that are readily available for any individual to purchase, mine,
 and exploit. The marketing community uses large-scale data aggregators,
 big data analytics, and social science techniques to deliver highly
targeted advertising campaigns. Does the availability of data for
purchase or for free, advanced marketing techniques (e.g., collaborative
 filtering, computational advertising), and low-cost big data analytic
capabilities (e.g., Amazon EC2) provide a determined adversary with the
tools necessary to inflict nation-state level damage? To what extent
could a non-state actor collect, process, and analyze a portfolio of
purchased and open source data to reconstruct an organizational profile,
 fiscal vulnerabilities, location of physical assets, work force
pattern-of-life, and other information [3], in order to construct a
deliberate attack on a specific capability? The goal of this topic is to
 develop tools to characterize and assess the nature, persistence, and
quality of data. The tools should be based on principled scientific
methods for sampling and relevant statistical methods for assessment.
Also of interest are tools to characterize the quality of data for
automated processing and analysis (i.e., a measure of how much manpower
would be required to use a specific source). Additionally, the goal of
this topic is to characterize the threat through the creation of tools,
techniques, and methodologies to measure the vulnerabilities in a given
set of public data. As an example, reconstructing the profile of an
organization from many data pieces using low computational-complexity
methods might indicate vulnerability. Also of interest to this topic is
the development of sensors, tools, and techniques necessary to defend
against the malicious use of data for purchase. Throughout the
performance of this research (Phases I, II, and III), there will be no
indefinite collection or storage of data sources containing personal
identifying information (PII). Develop a proof-of-concept system that
can automatically sample data from numerous sources, characterize the
data, and provide automatic feedback on the measurable risk inherent
with various collections of data. Develop methodology for risk
assessment and mitigation through reallocation of resources. PHASE I:
Investigate the landscape of public data both open and purchasable
across several domains (e.g., GIS, webpages, consumer data, social
media, etc.), through statistical data characterization and assessment.
Develop a set of risk factors for vulnerability including complexity of
the computation for compromise, and design a prototype tool set
necessary to automatically measure the risk inherent in the data.
Develop a plan for detailed implementation of methods in PHASE II and
III, including a data privacy plan. DIRECT TO PHASE II - Offerors
interested in submitting a Direct to PHASE II proposal in response to
this topic must provide documentation to substantiate that the
scientific and technical merit and feasibility described in the PHASE I
section of this topic has been met and describes the potential
commercial applications. Documentation should include all relevant
information including, but not limited to: technical reports, test data,
 prototype designs\/models, and performance goals\/results. Read and
follow Section 7.0 of the DARPA Instructions. PHASE II: Develop a
proof-of-concept system that can automatically sample data from numerous
 sources, characterize the data, and provide automatic feedback on the
measurable risk inherent with various collections of data. Develop
methodology for risk assessment and mitigation through reallocation of
resources. PHASE III: DOD entities including Army, Navy, and Air Force
are interested in operational security and not having their plans and
operations compromised through vulnerabilities in public data. In
addition, closing the any gaps in such vulnerabilities will minimize the
 attack front, in which the commercial organizations have interest. The
goals for this Phase, aimed at developing capabilities for defensive
countermeasures, are as follows. Deploy a tool into a near-real-time
environment that continually monitors available open source data,
measures vulnerabilities, and provides defensive countermeasures.
Develop a series of capabilities relevant to both government and
commercial organizations to defend against threats due to the
proliferation of purchasable or public data sets. Deploy a tool into a
near-real-time environment that continually monitors available open
source data, measures vulnerabilities, and provides defensive
countermeasures. Develop a series of capabilities relevant to both

Manufacturing Origin",
        "description": "This topic is eligible for the DARPA Direct to
PHASE II Pilot Program. Please see section 7.0 of the DARPA instructions
 for additional information. To be eligible, you must submit
documentation which demonstrates that PHASE I feasibility (as described
in PHASE I below). Offerors must choose between submitting a PHASE I
proposal OR a Direct to PHASE II proposal, and may not submit both for
the same topic. OBJECTIVE: Use measurable electronic and\/or physical
characteristics to identify the specific fabrication facility of origin
of a given electronic component. DESCRIPTION: DARPA seeks innovative
experimental and theoretical research leading to the identification of
specific process signatures on an electronic component which can be
uniquely associated with the semiconductor fabrication facility that
manufactured the component. Current methods of identifying fab of origin
 are generic. These methods currently include matching observed on-chip
ground rules used for polygon widths and spaces to values connected to a
 particular company in the literature; or finding distinctive structures
 or materials that are associated with specific company advertised
capabilities. The Department of Defense anticipates multiple uses for
such a capability, generally in the domain of improving supply chain
integrity. This project seeks to find specific structural, chemical,
magnetic, or electrical properties of generic on-chip features which are
 unique to a semiconductor fabrication facility, and which can be used
as fingerprints to deterministically identify the origin of a component.
 Even within the same lithography node and process gate definition,
certain idiosyncrasies associated with manufacturing tool installations,
 altitude and geomagnetic location of the facility, and chemical sources
 may assert detectable differences in the resulting product which can be
 observed or measured. Examples of facility-specific structure
differences might include: specific sidewall etch angle, front-end-of
line agglomeration, amount of gate activation, dose\/energy\/junction
positioning of implants, segregation of dopants, gettering, metal line
grain sizes, or wire liner thickness isotropies. Virtually thousands of
characteristics and parametrics might be associated with a given chip,
and indeed multiple chips and processes might be produced in a given fab
 simultaneously; from these, the performer will be expected to identify
those parametrics that are sufficiently unique in their statistical
presentation, even when compared to the same process installed in other
semiconductor fabrication facilities, or across different processes. It
should be assumed that these features must be recognized without the
benefit of having a specific metrology or reference structures
pre-placed for the purpose of identification. Analysis shall be limited
to features commonly available on electronic components. While
non-destructive electrical testing to determine identity provides the
most utility for the application, proposals advancing destructive
analysis are also acceptable. Techniques which in addition enable an
estimation of the date of manufacture are encouraged. It is anticipated
that in the execution of the project, a body of knowledge will be
accumulated which characterizes multiple major semiconductor fabrication
 facilities worldwide. PHASE I: Develop a concept for identifying a
semiconductor fabrication facility through the analysis of the
electrical parameters of the components that are built at that facility.
 Through experimentation, identify the parameters, or combination of
parameters, that can be used to create a measurable, repeatable
signature for purposes of identification. Determine the technical
feasibility of measuring the identified parameters and using those
measurements to uniquely identify the manufacturing origin of an
electronic component. DIRECT TO PHASE II - Offerors interested in
submitting a Direct to PHASE II proposal in response to this topic must
provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical
merit and feasibility described in the PHASE I section of this topic has
 been met and describes the potential commercial applications.
Documentation should include all relevant information including, but not
 limited to: technical reports, test data, prototype designs\/models,
and performance goals\/results. Read and follow Section 7.0 of the DARPA
 Instructions. PHASE II: Develop, demonstrate and validate a method for
electrical and\/or physical characterization of an electronic component
that can be used to identify the semiconductor fabrication facility
where the component was manufactured. To prove that the chosen
identifying characteristics are unique to a specific manufacturing
facility, validation should include the testing of parts acquired from
several facilities, including testing multiple parts from each facility.
 The expectation is to be able to create a database of signatures which
comprise the identifying characteristics for each semiconductor
fabrication facility. PHASE III: Potential military applications include
 hardware integrity assurance, anti-tampering, threat identification,
supply chain risk management and failure analysis. The ability to
identify the specific fabrication facility of origin of a given
electronic component has utility in a number of uses, including supply
chain risk management actions, intellectual property rights and
licensing enforcement, component dating and vintage analysis, and
inventory control. Commercial applications include the detection of
counterfeit electronic parts, establishment of intellectual property
rights and licensing enforcement, supply chain risk management, hardware
 failure analysis and inventory control.",

        "topic_name": "Hybrid Off-Road Motorcycle",
        "description": "This topic is eligible for the DARPA Direct to
Phase II Pilot Program. Please see section 7.0 of the DARPA instructions
 for additional information. To be eligible, you must submit
documentation which demonstrates Phase I feasibility (as described in
PHASE I below). Offerors must choose between submitting a Phase I
proposal OR a Direct to Phase II proposal, and may not submit both for
the same topic. OBJECTIVE: Develop the required technologies and
demonstrate a lightweight two-wheel drive (2WD) hybrid-electric off-road
 motorcycle for combat troop use powered by heavy fuels, capable of
short periods electric-only propulsion, and usable as a portable
electric power source for soldiers in the field. DESCRIPTION: This topic
 is based on four principal motivating factors: (1) Mobility for
deployed forces is enhanced by reducing the logistical support
requirements for volatile fuels (e.g., gasoline) and utilization of
readily-available heavy fuels (e.g., diesel, JP-8) for vehicles and
electrical power generation and by reducing the need to carry batteries
for electric\/electronic equipment. (2) Mobility through harsh
unimproved terrain is difficult due to soft soils, narrow, and steep
trails. A lightweight approach to effective two-wheel drive in
motorcycles is highly desirable. (3) A rapid and stealthy approach
toward enemy combatants enhances the element of surprise, but the
vehicles used for rapid mobility are generally compromised by vehicular
noise. (4) A desire to improve vehicular fuel efficiency. Technologies
relevant to this SBIR are being pursued for a variety of mobility
applications. Higher power density diesel engines are being developed
for aviation, although these tend to be of a larger capacity than
desired for motorcycles. While smaller than aviation diesels, auto
diesels are typically twice the weight of their equivalent
gasoline-fueled counterparts. The US Military had purchased the Hayes
M1030M1 diesel-powered motorcycle, but that vehicle is no longer in
production. The Dutch EVA Trac T800 is the only heavy-fuel motorcycle
currently on the market and it is designed around a purpose-built diesel
 engine. Heavy fuel fed reformers and fuel cells have been used for
stationary power applications. They are starting to see limited market
penetration in larger mobility applications. The DARPA Vulture program
for example is pursuing fuel cells with an energy density suitable for
aircraft applications. Turbines have been used for their heavy fuel
capability by a variety of platforms, ranging from tanks to missiles.
Unfortunately, they often suffer from comparatively high fuel
consumption and noise suppression challenges. Hybrid-electric power has
penetrated a wide variety of mobility markets ranging from construction
equipment and busses to personal automobiles. Following over 15 years of
 exploratory work by universities, small start-ups, and major motorcycle
 companies, hybrid motorcycles are on the verge of reaching the
marketplace. A variety of hybrid concepts have appeared at shows
including Yamaha"s Gen-Ryu and HV-X, and the Schneider-OCC hybrid
electric chopper. The Piaggio MP3 Hybrid 300ie three wheeled scooter
reached the market in 2010. These examples, those that have tried and
failed, as well as those that are currently under development have been
for on-road applications, which can more easily tolerate greater
weights. They have also relied on gasoline (Otto-cycle)\/generator pairs
 or in a few instances, hydrogen fuel-cells. All-wheel drive or
two-wheel drive motorcycles have been experimented with for nearly a
century and have experienced limited commercial success. The long-term
American product is the small Rokon Ranger with a mechanically driven
front wheel. Newer to the market is Christini Corp"s AWD 450. Other
current developments include the hydraulically driven Yamaha WR450F
2-Trac, and KTM"s recent patent for an electric front wheel drive. While
 the various pieces of interest exist in isolation, nobody has
successfully combined heavy fuel capability, 2WD, and hybrid powertrains
 into a useful off-road motorcycle. This is a very challenging component
 and system design problem. This SBIR proposes to address the challenge
through the innovative application of technology to develop a motorcycle
 capable of improving support for soldiers operating in remote and harsh
 environments. Desired characteristics of the vehicle include: Silent
electric only mode and low noise (&amp;lt;75 dB) during normal operation
 Production of supplemental power, e.g., for battery charging
Two-wheel-drive in support of extreme terrain operations Heavy fuel
compatibility&amp;gt;10% improvement in load-specific fuel consumption
as compared to existing fielded motorcycles PHASE I: Develop a
preliminary design for the hybrid motorcycle, establish and validate
performance goals, and develop a detailed analysis of expected
performance. Benchmark expected performance against extant non-hybrid
systems. Demonstrate key elements of the hybrid propulsion and energy
generation system, such as the engine, generator\/alternator, motor, and
 power control. Deliver a report documenting PHASE I accomplishments.
DIRECT TO PHASE II - Offerors interested in submitting a Direct to PHASE
 II proposal in response to this topic must provide documentation to
substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility
described in the PHASE I section of this topic has been met and
describes the potential commercial applications. Documentation should
include all relevant information including, but not limited to:
technical reports, test data, prototype designs\/models, and performance
 goals\/results. Read and follow Section 7.0 of the DARPA Instructions.
PHASE II: Further develop the concepts resulting from PHASE I into a
complete, detailed, executable design that also addresses operational
suitability, safety, manufacturability, maintainability, and operational
 durability. Produce a prototype motorcycle based on the developed
design. Demonstrate the vehicle in operationally representative
environments to verify and validate all functions and limitations of the
 design. Prior to conducting human factors testing, develop and obtain
approval for a human use plan. PHASE II deliverables include an
operational prototype vehicle and a PHASE II report. PHASE III: The
military could be expected to use this vehicle to replace motorcycles
such as the M1030M1 currently in service. Marine and Special Forces
users will be particularly interested in enhanced mobility and silent
running capabilities. Production versions of the resultant hybrid
motorcycle would be expected to be purchased by Army and Marine units.
Based on public interest in diesel and electric motorcycles, a
substantial commercial market is anticipated.",

Carbon-Carbon Laminates",

improvement concepts for 2D laminate hot load bearing carbon-carbon
structures. DESCRIPTION: The aerospace community has recently been
successful in making complex large scale, hot structure (&amp;gt;3000
deg), carbon-carbon (C-C) assemblies for high speed aerospace vehicles.
Future vehicle designs will push the limits of C-C material capabilities
 requiring a continued effort to characterize and improve the
performance, robustness, availability, and affordability of integrated
airframe structures fabricated using this material. Large scale
assemblies drive the current state of the art due to the unique set of
challenges they present, in particular thick aerodynamic and thermal
load carrying laminates. Technology development is required to produce
stronger, more reliable, and more producible thick parts (reduced
manufacturing time and cost) and thermo- mechanical stress models, as
well as higher resolution and more informative non-destructive
evaluations. Once developed, the structural properties and techniques
will have an immediate impact on production time and vehicle weights,
which will translate into quicker lead times and turnaround for multiple
 vehicle flight test programs. The purpose of this SBIR is to improve
the strength and consistency of thick C-C laminates used on large scale,
 load bearing airframe structures. With strength properties as the focus
 of improvements, improved properties will give more analytical
confidence during the design phase of programs. The manufacturing
techniques developed in the proposed program can also immediately be
incorporated on current programs to increase margins in the most
critical load areas. The offeror must demonstrate a clear understanding
of carbon-carbon processing technology of hot structures as applied to
flight testing of hypersonic systems. Coinciding with improved strength
properties, developing methods to rapidly make the thicker parts and
confirm quality assurance are priority in the proposal. PHASE I:
Evaluate the in-process stress states of thick Carbon-Carbon laminates
in order to optimize their fabrication, leading to improved strength
properties and faster production. In parallel, identify and assess
innovative non-destructive methods for evaluation of Carbon-Carbon
laminates and structures to be employed in subsequent work to
characterize and assure the quality of the laminates and the
subcomponent structures. Identify and evaluate existing and
developmental material systems (e.g. fabric, heat treatment, resins,
etc.) and identify and assess new methods as well as improvements to
existing methods of creating thick C-C laminates in order to increase
the mechanical properties and decrease the fabrication time. Prioritize
and rank these methods and provide plans to develop and demonstrate
those improvements. Conduct and report testing as needed to support
these assessments. The PHASE I deliverables will include monthly status
reports and a final report with detailed process descriptions and
material properties predictions supported by test demonstrations. DIRECT

include all relevant information including, but not limited to:
technical reports, test data, prototype designs\/models, and performance
 goals\/results. Read and follow Section 7.0 of the DARPA Instructions.
PHASE II: Develop and demonstrate new methods and improvements to
existing methods of creating thick C-C laminates in order to increase
the mechanical properties and decrease the fabrication time. The bulk of
 the program and corresponding analysis requirements will involve the
fabrication and testing of baseline material systems and the comparison
to multiple experimental material systems that vary processing
techniques, resins, processing schedules, and material. All of the
variations will focus on accommodating the processing stresses by
tailoring the properties of the material and distributing the loading.
Fabricate and conduct analysis and testing to characterize, relevant
large scale C-C assemblies, including components with varying thickness
and shape to demonstrate the processing approach viability and the
predicted material properties. Deliverables for this Phase will be
monthly status reports as well as a final report. Demonstrate and employ
 innovative non-destructive methods for evaluation of Carbon-Carbon
laminates and structures to characterize and assure the quality of the
laminates and the subcomponent structures.PHASE III: This technology is
applicable to all branches of the DoD and Military. Key military
applications may include, but are not limited to, hypersonic missiles,
hypersonic ISR aircraft, or on-demand space access vehicle. This
technology also has application in the commercial sector in the area of
efficient commercial access to space.",

        "topic_name": "Integrated Computational Materials Engineering in
 Multiphysics Software",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this research is to
 demonstrate a spatially-dependent calculation of detailed
microstructural evolution (e.g., grain structure, texture, precipitation
 kinetics, phase transformations, etc.) in the modeling of processing of
 a structural material ultimately providing or enhancing commercial
multiphysics software (e.g., general multiphysics or specialized for
welding, forging, molding, casting, extrusion, thermal spraying, powder
processing, etc.).  This project supports the goals of the Materials
Genome Initiative (MGI) in the area of Integrated Computational
Materials Engineering (ICME).    DESCRIPTION:  During materials
processing operations, the microstructure, physical properties, and
mechanical properties of a material can change significantly, both
globally and in localized regions of complex shapes.  These changes can
affect the behavior of the material during the processing operation, as
well as the final properties and performance in service.  Several simple
 examples include the evolution of spatially-varying microstructure and
texture during the closed-die forging of titanium alloys and nickel-base
 superalloys which often involve complex strain, strain rate, and
temperature histories.  Despite such complexity, most research groups
persist in using oversimplified phenomenological material models such as
 engineering stress-strain relations, Avrami-based recrystallization
relations, and other related approaches.  Though the bases for these
models revolve around some physical concepts (e.g., nucleation and
growth phenomena), the models themselves are often ad hoc or limited to a
 very specific processing regime over which measurements are available.
 The parameters that designers and analysts use to represent materials
behavior are convenient for databases, and the models calculate rapidly
for analysis, but predictions often match measured behavior only
approximately  and sometimes worse.    A long-term vision for Integrated
 Computational Materials Engineering and the Materials Genome Initiative
 involves providing complete spatial descriptions of the evolution of
microstructure, texture, and defects during materials processing
operations and resulting service properties.  This would enable the
design of both the material and process for end-state properties
tailored for a particular application.  Current multi-physics software
packages generally provide only rudimentary single-value, or
temperature-dependent, material properties.  Although single-parameter
state variables provide useful insight for such parameters as"damage",
they are not sufficient to describe completely (or even partially) the
state of the material.  Some codes provide the ability to estimate
microstructural information, such as grain size or fraction of
transformed\/recrystallized phase developed during or following
deformation based on phenomenological relations.  In addition, mesoscale
 simulations such as those based on Monte-Carlo, cellular automaton, and
 phase-field approaches may provide spatially resolved information, but
often such codes need input from global FEM type process-simulation
runs. Such de-coupled methods (involving post-processing-FEM predicted
field variables as input to mesoscale simulations of microstructure) are
 computationally simple, and provide simple system models for
optimization, but may not totally account for real material
non-linearity and the path dependence of microstructure evolution during
 multi-step processes.  Furthermore, in many instances, only specialized
 university-developed (non-commercial) codes provide the ability to
calculate microstructure and property evolution in complex
solidification, deformation, and heat treatment operations.    PHASE I:
 The successful phase I research will present a generic structure for
complex data comprising of microstructure and properties.  The
investigators will provide a detailed plan to integrate this data
structure, and the evolution of this data structure, within the existing
 confines of a thermomechanical-processing simulation code, that is
suitable for modeling the multi-step manufacture of a metal with
arbitrary boundary conditions such as finite element analysis.  It is
important to note that this data structure must be sufficiently flexible
 to allow modeling with a number of different microstructural and
textural features\/components.    PHASE II:  In the phase II effort, the
 investigators will carry out the plan devised in phase I and
incorporate the materials microstructure data structure into their code,
 and demonstrate performance for pertinent microstructural features (or
feature such as grain size, grain, shape, precipitate size\/volume
fraction) in a multi-step manufacturing process.  They shall also
demonstrate that they can expand the system on demand to accommodate a
large number of features\/states for a material, and associated local
constitutive behaviors.  Note that many interesting behaviors will
include non-uniform deformation and large changes in local strain rate
or temperature during processing.  The code must accommodate this in a
reasonable manner for the analyst\/designer to understand and utilize.
This effort must also include verification and validation of the
simulation code and material models, quantification of uncertainty,
transport of data between process and service-behavior simulations, and
methods of describing the detailed pedigree and sharing of all material
and process data for other computer-base applications.     PHASE III:
The design of components requires the ability to determine accurately
the structure and properties that evolve during primary processing and
manufacturing operations.  This toolset will allow the metals suppliers
to better simulate their processing operations, which will enable
superior design of their processing and manufacturing operations.  This
is of considerable interest to the aerospace and automotive industries.
 This will speed the design process and result in systems optimized for
superior reliability.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE
APPLICATIONS:  The processing of materials using non-uniform applied
conditions is routine in all of processing and manufacturing.  The local
 behavior of the material becomes extremely important to the response of
 the material, and the overall success in the processing operation.  We
anticipate that the specific code developed in this project will find
immediate use in the processing industry for critical components in all
sectors of the economy.  We further anticipate that the approaches and
methods developed in this project will find their way into other codes
for process modeling and simulation.  Although the methods and
approaches may be too expensive computationally for
proof-of-concept-level designs, we expect these approaches to become
routine for the integrated detail design of materials, processes,
manufacturing operations, and components.",

        "topic_name": "A Semantic Technology for Materials Design and
Development",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate the
foundational elements required to create a semantic technology for
materials design and development.    DESCRIPTION: Several foundational
elements required to achieve Sir Tim Berners-Lee"s vision for a semantic
 web are in place and available to the materials community.  The
semantic web, sometimes referred to as the web-of-data, focuses on
ontologies as well as the linking data for machine-to-machine data
interchange (implemented via RDF and OWL).  Linkage between multiple
datasets, files and their respective metadata can be established in an
ad hoc fashion without having to adhere to specific database table
structures.      Linked data without context is of limited value.  A
semantic web for materials requires common vocabularies.  An example of a
 common vocabulary is the Dublin Core (DC) ontology, a set of
universally accepted metadata used to describe a resource (e.g.
document).  The development and publishing of vocabulary using RDFS\/OWL
 is one of the initial steps required to link relevant materials
information across disparate (federated) sources.  The development of
common vocabularies could be jump-started by businesses via crowd
sourcing and curated by materials subject matter experts (SME).
Additionally, collaborative efforts with professional societies and
other organizations (e.g. ASTM terminology standards, CEN, ASM, TMS,
etc.) could be used to accelerate vocabulary\/ontology development.
Over time, multiple vocabularies would likely winnow down to key sets of
 generally accepted terms and mappings between terms having the same
meaning.    Taxonomies, a form of ontology, can express simple
relationships in the materials domain.  More sophisticated relationships
 between materials processing, structure and properties can be expressed
 using complex ontologies.  These ontologies need to be developed and
implemented using World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendations like
RDF\/OWL or widely accepted semantic technology standards such as
time.owl and DC.    As the above elements are being established on a
larger scale, various forms of materials informatics could be developed
to greatly expand the materials data and design space for the materials
scientists and engineers. Success requires innovative approaches during
the development of agents to query linked materials data, applications
to mash-up and integrate data, and reasoning\/inferencing engines
specifically tailored to the materials domain.  Machine learning and
other innovative"data hungry"approaches to extract knowledge could be
developed and applied for materials design.    PHASE I:  Develop a
proof-of-concept for semantically linked materials data and information
to include vocabularies\/ontologies.  Use these technologies to
demonstrate sophisticated semantic queries for materials data and
information.  Develop approaches for increasing ontology richness,
capturing provenance and ensuring appropriate access to restricted
linked materials data (e.g. export controlled or Intellectual Property).
  Consider how the system could expand to accommodate manufacturing and
component design.    PHASE II:  Develop a robust midlevel materials
ontology ready for crowd sourcing and initial experimental research use.
  Explore more sophisticated low level ontologies.  Significantly expand
 the size of or integration across data stores.  Propose and demonstrate
 computational approaches for establishing provenance and processing
restricted linked materials data and information.  Provide examples of
integration with manufacturing or component design domains.    PHASE
III:  Use the Phase II work to fully develop an operational crowd
sourcing materials ontology, linked-data capability to support the open
materials research and development community.  Develop linkages to
manufacturing and component design domain.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL
POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS:  There is a growing realization that
that vast amounts of historical and future materials development data is
 a valuable untapped resource for materials design.  Those who support
the development of a linked materials data concept and develop the tools
 to organize, relate, digest and synthesize the vast amount of materials
 data will likely find a welcome demand for their products from the
community of materials designers, product designers and manufacturers in
 both the private and public sectors.",

 Materials Processing and Applications",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop predictive computational
models\/tools to exploit the effect of electromagnetic fields in
materials processing that enables tailored polycrystalline
microstructures, enhanced properties, and shortened materials
development cycles beyond the current state-of-the-art.    DESCRIPTION:
 The Army is interested in applying external physics-based fields during
 the processing of materials to develop enhanced properties and
performance that is otherwise unachievable by conventional processing
methods.  The use of electromagnetic (EM) fields in materials processing
 and in controlling properties during their application has the
potential to increase affordably, engender materials with unique
properties, and to produce a specific property over the duration of
field application (i.e., property selection on demand).  The targeted
physical and mechanical properties identified for enhancement may
include but should not be limited to strength, hardness, fracture
toughness, elastic modulus, or fatigue life.  While numerous
field-assisted methods have been experimentally explored over the years,
 the ability to simulate the effect that these fields have on the
microstructure and, in turn, the properties and performance are not as
prevalent.  In order for computational methods to succeed in this
endeavor, they must be able to capture the fundamental physics
associated with how these field effects couple to, interact with, and
affect the underlying microstructure and, hence, the resultant
properties of the material.  The goal of this SBIR is to develop the
computational framework, models, and tools necessary to predict behavior
 under field effects and to design new materials using field effects
with properties that are otherwise not achievable using conventional
processing techniques.    Of particular interest in this SBIR is
utilizing electromagnetic fields to engineer the microstructure and
properties of polycrystalline metals for defense-related applications.
The polycrystalline materials targeted for this work include
conventional aluminum, copper, iron, tungsten, titanium, or magnesium
alloys.  The processing applications of interest for these models, with
and without electromagnetic fields, include heat treatment and annealing
 of conventional metal alloys; electrodeposition, mechanical milling, or
 nanocrystallization processes for generating ultrafine grained and
nanocrystalline materials; relieving residual stresses imposed during
processing; surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) techniques,
shot peening, burnishing, etc.  Previous literature has focused on how
electromagnetic fields have been used to exert influence on
metallurgical phenomena, such as grain boundary migration, grain
boundary segregation, formation of texture, recrystallization,
precipitation, phase transformation and sintering.  For example, high
magnetic fields have been used to both suppress abnormal grain growth
and engineer the grain boundary character distribution of polycrystals.
   PHASE I:  The goal of Phase I is to develop a physics-based
computational model that can predict the evolution of microstructure and
 properties under intense electromagnetic fields during material
processing.  This model will be used to develop novel materials with
tailored microstructures and properties to address Army materials needs
or goals.  The deliverables for Phase I are (1) a validated
computational model that is capable of predicting the effect of
electromagnetic fields and resulting changes in processing path on
material properties, (2) the data created or used to validate this
model, and (3) a physical example of applying this model to a material
system demonstrating a quantifiable change in properties of the selected
 material system.  Execute a strategy that incorporates materials of
interest and process-specific technologies while providing
self-identified and challenging but achievable goals that target Army
interests.    PHASE II:  The goal of Phase II is to provide additional
research and development of methodologies that will culminate in a
validated software tool for predicting microstructure and properties in
multiple alloy systems that meet or exceed current\/future Army
materials criteria.  In this phase, it is envisioned that the
computational models will be further extended by validating for multiple
 alloy systems of interest, performing parameter sensitivity studies and
 uncertainty analysis for the model, and utilizing within a robust
design optimization framework with uncertainty to obtain optimal
processing paths with electromagnetic fields in an effort to target
different customized microstructures and material property
specifications.  The computational model should be packaged as software
or as optional add-on modules in existing commercial software products.
    PHASE III:  The goal of Phase III is to commercialize the developed
capability for tailoring microstructures and properties subjected to
intense electromagnetic fields.  This phase should clearly demonstrate
the return on investment from utilizing the developed computational
capability to achieve\/improve material properties.      PRIVATE SECTOR
COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS:  The underlying
technology(ies) associated with this topic are broadly applicable to all
 materials that require thermal processing and are physically receptive
to electromagnetic fields.  The potential advantages of the processing
technology, including energy savings, properties control and tailoring,
and small volume production are equally valuable to both commercial and
defense manufacture.  Virtually all metals and many ceramics industries,
 even commodity industries, as well as commercial and defense aerospace,
 automotive, and ship industries could benefit.",

Properties",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this project is to
design and develop a modeling tool for materials designers, which uses
as input on the microstructure quantitative statistical measures of
structure variations and features, and provides efficiently information
on materials behavior with robust quantitative measures of performance
variations and their correlations with microstructure features.  This
project supports the goals of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) in
the area of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME).
DESCRIPTION:  The behavior of individual crystalline grains in a
material is well modeled and understood.  For the behavior of
polycrystalline media, however, we revert to relatively simple bulk
constitutive models that often only roughly approximate our observations
 of macroscopic behavior.  Local misorientations result in deviations in
 local responses, which can be much larger than any other deviations
seen in analysis.  Aggravating this is that these field problems are
non-linear in the materials properties, which limits the applicability
of many perturbation and spectral approaches.  Finally, the exact grain
positions and orientations are usually random, which makes single
examinations of example microstructures limited in overall applicability
 for a materials design problem.  More important to the designer is a
measure of the mean behavior with quantitative predictions of the likely
 deviations, the correlations of these deviations, and the sensitivities
 of these deviations to the microstructure features.  These allow the
designer to make predictions of the reliability of the material.    The
objectives of this research area are to design and develop a stochastic
analysis code (for example, finite element analysis, boundary element
analysis, peridynamics), using as inputs the statistical properties of
the microstructure of the material, and outputting the performance
characteristics, including variations, fluctuations, and correlations in
 materials behavior.  The code should allow the design and development
of random-field constitutive behavior models based on adaptations of
homogenization of crystal plasticity models, or other similar
mechanism-based models, that provide statistical information on material
 behavior at the polycrystalline length scale, and are suitable for
insertion into stochastic analysis models.  Objective outcomes should
include the design and development of visualization tools that use
robust archival data formats, and display mean-field, uncertainty, and
sensitivity parameters, in a manner suitable to a materials designer.
The research should also develop and design a suite of test and
evaluation methods to determine experimentally the materials properties
parameters necessary to populate the constitutive models (such methods
might be reentrant).  This work will utilize the construct of integrated
 computational materials engineering, supporting the development of the
materials innovation infrastructure within the Materials Genome
Initiative.      PHASE I:  The successful phase 1 effort will
demonstrate successfully the concept and mathematical basis for the code
 and its use in materials and product design to meet the objectives
stated above.  The effort shall also produce a roadmap\/timeline for the
 code development and testing.    PHASE II:  The Phase II project will
develop and demonstrate the code the concept from Phase I.  The
investigators will demonstrate the uses of the code in the design of a
hypothetical component of interest.  The investigators will also outline
 a market for the tool, and a plan for a second iteration of development
 to meet that market.    PHASE III:  The design of critical components
requires careful consideration of the reliability of the components in
the likely service environments.  The designer, having a means of
dealing directly with the randomness of the material and the
environment, can consider the reliability issues as part of the design
process, and not as an a posteriori process.  This will speed the design
 process and result in systems optimized for superior reliability.

 system-on-chip electronic-photonic system simulation tools.
DESCRIPTION: Today, the military and commercial application spaces for
silicon photonics are expanding very rapidly.  The first wave of
commercial products are aimed at the telecommunications and data
communications spaces, but applications in biosensing, analog data
processing, coherent systems, laser ranging, and many other areas are
rapidly emerging.    One of the central pillars of the electronics
industry is the electronic design automation infrastructure.  A wide
range of very sophisticated software is available for modeling
electronic circuits.  This ranges from TCAD, which is used to design the
 actual transistors, to SPICE, which is used to design analog circuits
and elements, up to a wide variety of digital tools at the circuit and
system level.  These tools are crucial for managing the complexity of
electronic circuit designs, and they enable IP reuse and rapid design
iteration, while radically reducing experimental and test risk.    By
contrast, the simulation tools for photonics and more specifically,
silicon photonics, are extremely primitive.  FDTD and finite element
tools are adequate for device design, and have become quite mature.  The
 tools from the TCAD world are quite adequate for modeling active
devices like modulators and photodetectors.  But the higher-level,
system-oriented tools are extremely immature compared to what is
available in electronics. There is a substantial opportunity for new
approaches to this problem.  Of particular interest are approaches that
meet the following key requirements: (1) Close, seamless integration
between standard electronic design automation environments and optical
device simulation; (2) Hierarchical abstraction into compact models of
the key device physics; (3) Design-for-test integration; (4) Ability to
easily change the tradeoff between the level of physical detail being
modeled and the speed of the simulation; (5) Ability to simulate in both
 frequency (small-signal) and time domains (large signal); and (6) Use

Control Unit Efficiency Improvement",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate a phase
change material based thermal buffer to enable"rightsizing"of
environmental control units (ECUs) and improve overall efficiency
through reduced peak loads, more stabilized ECU operation, and off-peak
thermal energy storage.    DESCRIPTION:  Military Environmental Control
Units (ECUs) represent one of the dominant energy users in forward
operating environments, and significant effort is being made to
improving overall ECU efficiency [1].  Reducing overall Size, Weight and
 Power (SWaP) of military ECU"s is complicated by the transient, yet
predictable, nature of the thermal demand profile over the course of a
typical daily usage cycle, where cooling capacity must currently be set
to match the daily peak load.  This need for cooling unit exess-capacity
 creates trickle-down effects of increasing installed power generation
requirements and logistic transport burdens. ECU
capacity"right-sizing"can help meet Operational Energy Strategy
requirements for improved net energy efficiency, but will demand
significant changes to ECU design.    Thermal Energy Storage (TES) has
been shown to be effective in load-leveling the daily cooling profile
for fixed facilities, providing reductions in net energy consumption in
some cases due to"free cooling"[2], as well as reduced compressor
cycling, more steady cooling, and reduced peak power requirements [3,4].
 However, because of the compositional variability in cooled facilities
in forward operating environments, implementing TES would require
directly integrating the technology within mobile ECUs, a task which has
 received only cursory attention in the literature and would require
optimization of overall size and weight in addition to reducing energy
usage.  Solid-liquid Phase Change Materials (PCMs) present one
high-density TES option for cooling systems and environmental control
[5,6], yet challenges remain in material selection, heat exchanger
topology and integration strategy to maximize operational benefit.
This SBIR program seeks to develop a PCM-based solution to enhance the
performance of an existing ECU in the 9-18k BTUH range, addressing
concerns of system energy density, material compatibility, and failure
modes due to repeated thermal cycling. Offeror is expected to propose a
phase change TES component that can be integrated into an existing ECU
for the purpose of off-peak load leveling or demand reduction, with a
target energy usage reduction of 5-10% over an average daily cycle,
assuming no more than an 25F diurnal temperature variation. Unit should
still be able to provide rated cooling capacity under worse case
conditions in a deployed environment (design condition 125F ambient, 90F
 indoor dry bulb, 75F indoor wet bulb) for a period of at least 2 hours
during daily peak demand period. Specification of PCM type, integration
point (on refrigerant or air-side flow paths), storage temperature, and
storage heat exchanger design are left up to the offeror, however those
decisions and the associated impact on overall system size, weight and
performance should be justified through thermodynamic analysis and
system\/component modeling.    PHASE I:  Offeror will demonstrate
through simulation or experimentation the feasibility of combining
thermal energy storage with an existing compact environmental control
unit to achieve a 5-10% net energy usage reduction. If not demonstrated
experimentally, performance simulation should convincingly account for
non-ideal heat transfer, material and and thermodynamic conditions.
Overall increase to ECU size and weight tradeoff with cooling capacity
gain should be captured. During this phase commercialization aspects
must be considered and potential plans for commercialization elucidated.
     PHASE II:  Demonstrate a fully functioning prototype system using
the concept developed in Phase I. Performance should also be measured
under varying ambient conditions to ascertain performance sensitivities,
 and offeror should evaluate design scalability to larger capacity ECUs.
 Validate analytical and numerical models developed in Phase I.    PHASE
 III: Design and develop phase change TES units for ECUs using the
knowledge gained during Phases I and II, targeting integration into PM
MEP Improved ECU (IECU) systems.  This series of ECUs must meet military
 unique requirements, e.g. shock, vibration, and environmental
variability.",

pressure measurement system to continuously measure combustion pressure
in diesel engine cylinders, which is affordable, durable, and accurate,
for future use in real-time adaptive engine controls of fuel injection.
   BACKGROUND\/DESCRIPTION:  Unlike commercial diesel engines which are
typically designed to operate on a single fuel such as U.S. ultra-low
sulfur highway diesel (ULSD), military engines must be able to operate
on a variety of distillate fuels, typically jet and worldwide diesel
fuels, due to worldwide deployments.  Most U.S. military diesel engines
are adapted commercial engines and have no ability to compensate for the
 varying properties among jet (JP-8, JP-5, Jet-A1, and others) and
worldwide diesel fuels. Jet fuels, which are otherwise similar to arctic
 diesel fuels, pose a particular problem because the cetane index, a
measure of a diesel fuel"s tendency to ignite upon injection, is not
controlled in jet fuels (except in recent synthetic jet fuel blend
specifications) and is typically low.  A low cetane index causes power
loss, inefficient combustion, poor low-temperature starting and in
severe cases, damage due to excessive chamber pressures.      Real-time
adaptive electronic engine controls could manage these effects by
adjusting diesel fuel injection timing and rate according to fuel
combustion performance, but a high data-rate system to continuously
measure combustion pressure is needed to provide input data.  The system
 must be affordable, durable and accurate, and detect explosive
combustion events which can occur with very low cetane fuels.  By
closely monitoring and controlling combustion pressure in real-time, a
military engine control will adapt on-the-fly to fuels with a broad
range of ignition properties, allowing military engines to attain high
power output and efficiency despite variable fuel properties.  Sensors
with the desired sensing capability are now used in diesel engine
laboratory research, but they are large, costly and not designed for use
 in vehicles.    Because the integral of combustion pressure and volume
reveals the work produced in a single firing event, data from the
high-speed pressure sensor makes it possible for an engine control,
using crank position data to determine piston travel, to determine
precisely how to adjust diesel injection timing to get maximum
efficiency from an injected unit of fuel.      When used in commercial
engines, high speed precision pressure measurement will allow engine
control units to better control nitrogen oxide, hydrocarbon and smoke
emissions by precisely managing the fuel injection timing and quantity
to attain the optimal pressure-temperature profile in each combustion
event. This will enable smaller exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) flows,
reducing the parasitic power burden used for EGR cooling and recovering
some of the engine efficiency that is currently lost to EGR
implementation.    PHASE I: Design    1.  The contractor shall design a
high data-rate pressure sensor that continuously and directly measures
individual cylinder combustion pressures in diesel engines, and the
corresponding data acquisition system.    1.1 The sensor shall measure
with +\/- 1% accuracy over the pressure range 0-350 bar, and shall be
capable of measuring at 27,000 readings per second, equivalent to one
measurement per degree of crank angle rotation in an engine running at
4500 revolutions per minute.  The sensor shall also be able to measure a
 pressure rise rate of at least 810 bar per millisecond in order to
detect explosive combustion events.     1.2 The sensor shall be designed
 for a working life of 10,000 hours.     1.3 The sensor tip shall have
no more than a 4 millimeter (mm) diameter exposed face in the combustion
 chamber, shall not protrude into the combustion volume and shall not
alter fuel injection spray patterns.     1.4 The installed sensor shall
filter out the effects of engine vibration, and must be immune to carbon
 fouling and combustion chamber temperatures in its mounting location.
  1.5 The contractor shall show by analysis and experiment that the
physical principles of the sensor design are feasible for use in a
cylinder pressure sensor. The contractor shall build a test article that
 is based on the sensor"s operating principle, and show that the sensor
is feasible at room temperature and the intended operating pressures and
 frequencies.      1.6 The contractor shall design a data acquisition
system for the high data-rate sensor that can receive a total of up to
27,000 measurements per second from up to twelve engine cylinders
simultaneously and can output digital pressure data for each engine
cylinder in a form usable by an electronic diesel engine control system.
  The data acquisition system shall be designed to operate on 24 volts
DC power.    1.7 The data acquisition system design shall include
cabling or other communications means between the sensors and the data
acquisition system and the cabling shall be designed to be durable in a
heavy vehicle engine compartment environment.     1.8 The complete
sensor and data acquisition system shall be designed for a target cost
of $300, based on a variant intended for installation in a six-cylinder
commercial truck engine.    PHASE II: Demonstration    2. The contractor
 shall build and demonstrate the sensor and data acquisition system
designed in paragraphs 1.1 -1.6 above.    2.1 The sensors and data
acquisition system shall be demonstrated on a multi-cylinder diesel
engine in a test cell environment.  The demonstration will not require
any actual control of the engine or interaction with the engine
controller.  2.2 The contractor shall demonstrate that the data
acquisition system can support twelve sensors in operation, but
demonstration on an engine is not required.    CONTRACT DELIVERABLES:
a. Monthly technical reports in letter format, with a financial report
of actual vs planned spending.  b. Final technical report with
conceptual drawings of the sensor and cabling.   c. One complete set of
six sensors, and a sensor data acquisition system for government
testing.  d. Documentation of the algorithms used for the data
acquisition system, the data output format, and a government-editable
version of the data acquisition system software with documentation

Autonomous System Control",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop interface(s) to allow users
to"teach"or program robotic manipulation and mobility through virtual
simulation and through real-world demonstration which the robot can
apply autonomously in various situations.    DESCRIPTION:  It is not
likely that an autonomous system can be programmed with all the
information it requires to perform every mission or every variation of
every contingency within the near future.  One way to address this issue
 is to provide user-friendly means to teach or program a robot to add to
 its autonomous capability.   This proposal focuses on the physical
aspects of the robot performance, manipulation and mobility, and the
combination of the two, whole-body manipulation.1  Optimally, one would
teach a robot as one would teach a human how to perform a physical task.
 Since this would be an initial entry into intuitive user friendly
methods to teach a robot to perform complex physical acts, it is
advisable to start with a virtual representation or simulation that lay
the foundation for the interface and programming syntax that would
describe the physical actions of the robot.2  Programming a robot to use
 a new tool provides a good example where"teaching"will prove
beneficial.  There are issues with teaching proper grasp of the tool,
and the proper pose that would allow the robot to use the tool
effectively and apply forces that would not damage the object(s) the
tool is acting upon, the tool, or the robot. Thus, before the issues of
the human interface are addressed, the basic issues of control for a
dynamic multi-body system must be solved in manner that can be
represented as a form that can be programmed into a robot.2,3      Focus
 should be placed first on the development of a software architecture
that encompasses and integrates task and motion planning for whole body
manipulation.   The software should have the ability to program a robot
to perform physical tasks through a virtual environment capable of
modeling dynamics and physical contact\/interaction without the need for
 a user such as a Soldier to write a"C-level"program.  However, the
programming constructs or"subroutines"created by this architecture to
operate the robot must be accessible and usable in common programming
languages such as C\/C++ and Python as open architecture libraries and
subroutines. The newly learned behavior must be of a structure that the
robot can incorporate it into its existing control programming and
implement it autonomously.  It is expected that in order to implement
the virtual environment model of the robot which would include
descriptions of its physical configurations, actuators, and sensors,
highly trained and educated personnel may be needed. The virtual model
should be of a fidelity that allows control for a dynamic multi-body
system to be developed.  However, once the detailed model is implemented
 in the virtual environment, the software should provide an interface
that allows a user such as a Soldier to interact with and program a
robot through the virtual environment to perform a physical task such as
 grasping or repetitive tasks such as sweeping for mines and IEDs, and
trenching for wires.     A secondary focus should be to develop an open
software architecture that can be built upon and evolve through time
that will allow DoD, Universities, and private industry to collaborate
as a software development community on this problem. Open architecture
efforts such as ROS should serve as an example. There should be
interfaces for well-established speech recognition and vision libraries
such as OpenCV.  It is expected that the architecture will allow for
future advancements to be added.  For example there are different
methodologies for"teaching"how to recognize a physical object. 4 The
open software architecture should have the proper interface to allow
object and feature recognition packages\/algorithms to be added and
updated.    PHASE I:  The deliverables should include a final Phase I
report that describes a feasibility concept that encompasses the
architecture, algorithms and hardware needed to implement graphical and
visual input to script an act of whole body manipulation, that can be
implemented as part of a library describing autonomous motion for a
robot.  Requirements for graphical input or interface for physics-based
virtual robot models must also be documented. The feasibility concept
should include a description of software interface architecture for
future expandability.    PHASE II:  Phase II shall produce and deliver a
 prototype system for teaching a robot to perform mobility, manipulation
 and whole-body manipulation.  The Phase II system shall be demonstrated
 to operate as a simulation of an actual robotic platform.  The control
constructs generated by the prototype teaching software will be used to
program tasks in which the robot will need to interact with objects and
the environment using whole body manipulation.  The user should not need
 to write a text-based program.  However it should be demonstrated that
the robot control constructs generated may be used as libraries
in"C\/C++"code.  Also to be demonstrated is the learned behavior being
implemented in a manner in which the robot may use the behavior in
conjunction with its previous programming.     The prototype system
should include:    A documented open architecture framework and
algorithms that allows additions and modifications to autonomous
manipulation, mobility, and whole-body manipulation control.
Prototype simulation software to augment the learning process with open
architecture interfaces for programming a robot capable of implementing
whole-body manipulation.    Demonstrations of learned\/modified
autonomous whole body manipulation behavior.    The virtual environment
software and interface hardware developed should be compatible with RS
JPO interoperability standards.  The architecture and algorithms for
robot control will be fully documented. The source code will be made
available to DoD employees.  Source code will follow common standards of
 open source programming and be compatible with ROS.     PHASE III: DUAL
 USE COMMERCIALIZATION:  Research could be transitioned to DoD and first
 responder efforts, or University research programs. Robots in industry
may be programmed for adaptability to changes in the fabrication
process.  If the software is adopted as a standard, it may allow a
descriptive verbal language for instructing robots to develop. Better
operator interfaces should reduce the skill level required to program
robots for enhanced robot autonomous operation adaptability. This is
especially true for advanced robot control concepts.",

        "topic_name": "Virtual Verification Test Bed for Robust
Autonomous Software Operation in Complex, Unknown Environments",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop an innovative verification
tool to assess the robustness of run time safety systems bounding
autonomous and learning algorithms for operation in untrained\/unknown
environments.    DESCRIPTION:  It is understood that an autonomous
unmanned air, ground, or sea vehicles can incur a near infinite decision
 space that is difficult to capture completely in extensive simulation.
The response of these vehicles to untrained environments can potentially
 have unintended consequences to adversely affect safety. This is of
particular concern when these vehicles are considered for collaborative
manned\/unmanned teaming missions. For such systems, a run time
verification engine may be developed to ensure the safety of human life
by constraining the output of the autonomous algorithm to guarantee
actions are correct, interpretable, and recoverable. The autonomous
algorithm combined with the failsafe mechanism is intended to improve
the robustness of autonomous systems to unknown environments and
unexpected events. However, if such a failsafe\/recovery mechanism
existed, what evaluation systems are available to test their viability
and robustness? The intent of this solicitation is to develop a
verification method to examine the robustness of a run time safety
algorithm.     The first objective is to examine the techniques
presented in [1][2] and apply them to an autonomous unmanned vehicle
model that includes a learning trajectory generation algorithm. The
techniques in [1] present a method to protect the behavior of an
adaptive \/ learning function. The techniques in [2][3] present methods
to analyze the robustness of the implemented safety algorithm.  Due to
the dependence of autonomous systems on historical state data, current
simulation environments require the need for extensive run times to
reach a potential unintended operating region. Additionally, as a
greater quantity of information is fused and utilized by the autonomous
algorithm to make decisions, gradual, unintended data streams may induce
 state conditions that may cause an unsafe or unpredictable response.  A
 key capability must be to rapidly re-stimulate the system to an
untrained, unintended, or erroneous operating state in order to assess
the robustness of the run time safety algorithm.     The verification
algorithm must implement:      A method to introduce specific logical or
 run time operating states that induce an algorithm failure.     A
mechanism for recording and initializing systems to specific states.
 An interface control description that emulates real world sensor
outputs to be provided to the system under test.     The generation of a
 robustness measure around an operating region [2][3].    PHASE I:  The
objective of the Phase I effort is to examine the robustness techniques
presented in [2][3] and apply them to a run time protected [1]
autonomous unmanned vehicle model to ensure safety of human life when
cooperating with manned vehicles. It is expected that the offeror should
 have, at proposal, a Matlab (or similar) model of a representative
autonomous unmanned vehicle and a learning algorithm present to decide
new trajectories based on initial goals and changing environmental
conditions. The Phase I effort shall include the development of a
notional verification tool applying the techniques in [1][2], that
includes a run time verification engine that only allows the learning
system to traverse within a pre-defined safety boundary and  that
analyizes the robustness of the algorithm response.     The Phase I
deliverables should include:     A proof of concept model in Matlab (or
similar) implementation of a runtime verification robustness analysis
tool demonstrating feasibility and scalability of the approach.     A
Phase I final report that will include a full modeling and analysis tool
 conceptual system design and an implementation plan for the follow-on
tool development.      PHASE II: The Phase II effort shall implement and
 extend the verification method. This tool will enable modeling of
learning based unmanned systems and will generate test cases based upon
user specified failure modes. These test cases will then be
automatically run against the autonomy using the previously implemented
communication interface and initial condition injection. The company
must provide the capability to provide a robustness quantification
metric that is updated as the model is subjected to new and unexpected
behaviors according to the given requirements and safety specifications.
    The Phase II prototype software should show proof-of-concept by
applying the tool to a particular, relevant DoD use case.  Of particular
 interest would be use cases that can be generalized across domains
(e.g., Underwater vehicles) or include heterogeneous autonomous systems
(e.g., air\/ground\/sea coordination).    PHASE III: DUAL USE
COMMERCIALIZATION:  Improved trust in robust autonomous systems will
enable the use of complex learning algorithms in safety critical
applications. Capability can be used in future government programs
including applications in the Department of Defense, Transportation, and
 Energy that require robustness guarantees of future adaptive\/learning
autonomous vehicles operating in congested and safety critical
environments. Capability can be used in future commercial programs,
enabling the certification and transition of applications such as
self-driving cars, autonomous cargo aircraft, etc.",

        "topic_name": "Technologies for Low-Bandwidth, High-Latency
Unmanned Ground Vehicle Control",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop algorithmic approaches to
enabling robust control of autonomous unmanned ground vehicles operating
 in complex, unstructured environments, over low-bandwidth, high latency
 communication links.    DESCRIPTION:  This topic addresses the problem
of robustly commanding and controlling unmanned ground vehicles
operating in complex, unstructured environments. Current approaches to
this task rely on dense scene reconstruction from a variety of sensor
data such as LIDAR and video imagery. Scene representations are then
relayed to a remote human operator who provides commands at varying
levels of supervisory control (intelligent teleoperation).    Challenges
 arise in scenarios where the available communication link allows only
low bandwidth data transmission and\/or exhibits high latency.  In such
scenarios, bandwidth limitations prevent rich scene representations from
 being transmitted from the vehicle to the operator in a timely manner.
 In addition, high latency may have a destabilizing effect, causing
commands issued by the operator to lead to unsafe actions by the
vehicle.  This effect is exacerbated as the frequency of command inputs
increases.    Novel frameworks, and associated algorithms, are required
to enable robust operations of autonomous unmanned ground vehicles
operating in complex, unstructured environments, over a low-bandwidth,
high latency communication link. Such approaches would provide an
operator with sufficient information to make timely command and control
decisions, even in harsh communication scenarios. They would also
provide contingency-based assurance of system safety in the absence of
timely command and control decisions. In addition, other functional
relationships such as sensor costs need to be addressed since these
costs are generally proportional to the level of autonomy or
intelligence.     Approaches to this problem may emphasize perception,
vehicle control, or some combination of the two. In the perception
domain, approaches to intelligent data compression and minimal scene
representation are desired [1]. Such approaches may condense raw sensor
data into compact, human-recognizable primitives that can be efficiently
 transmitted over low-bandwidth communication links. These methods may
be optimized for particular contexts (e.g. urban operations) to enable
improved data compression, and they may also dynamically vary scene
representation richness or complexity depending on available bandwidth.
    In the control domain, contingency-based control algorithms that
ensure vehicle safety in the absence of operator inputs, or when
provided with unsafe command inputs (perhaps due to the effects of
latency) are desired. Again, such approaches may be optimized for
particular contexts to enable improved performance. Methods that act as
vehicle"co-pilots", which both ensure vehicle safety and attempt to
predict operator intent, would be particularly useful [2].    The output
 of this work is software that would be integrated with an existing
autonomous vehicle(s) to yield measureable improvements in safety and
operational speed compared to a baseline system, for the low-bandwidth,
high-latency scenarios of interest.  If successful, this work will have
broad applications for autonomous and semi-autonomous military vehicle
operations.    PHASE I: The goal of Phase I is to investigate the
feasibility of developing algorithms that can robustly handle huge
variations in both bandwidth and latency while still maintaining levels
of overall mission control that are comprehensible to a human operator.
On the unmanned ground vehicle side, these variations could in the worst
 case scenario transition within milliseconds from sufficiently high
bandwidth and low enough latency to permit as-needed transitions into
tele-operator mode, down to no communications at all. Upon such
transitions, the unmanned ground vehicle should demonstrate an ability
to replace direct human command with an emulation of human command that
consists of some hierarchy (possibly very simple) of specific mission
goals and navigation rules. On the human side, the mission supervisor
software should similarly use its knowledge of the intent of the
unmanned ground vehicle to provide the best possible visual
representation of its likely status, including for example explicit
graphical methods for representing growing uncertainty. Feasibility of
the proposed framework\/algorithmic approach(es) may be demonstrated
through modeling and simulation for initial developmental verification.
The Phase I deliverables shall include a final report detailing the
algorithms, theory, and initial performance data. In addition, the final
 report should testing options for very diverse exploration of changing
bandwidth and latency during the operation. The addition of noise is
desirable but not required.    PHASE II: Phase II shall produce
prototype software with focus on implementation and testing of the
framework\/algorithm(s) developed in Phase I.  Phase II prototype
verification shall be demonstrated through modeling and simulation with
particular emphasis on proof-of-concept and performance. General testing
 shall execute options developed in Phase I concerning exploration of
changing bandwidth and latency during operation. The prototype software
system shall include:     Fully documented framework\/algorithms in open
 source with compatibility to ROS.     Prototype demonstrations using
Modeling and Simulation in a credible simulation environment, or an
unmanned ground vehicle platform..     Final Report detailing all
development, design, and testing to include performance metrics.
PHASE III: Work in Phase III will focus on the transition of Phase II
prototype software to a DoD relevant environment and platform(s).
Specific DoD interface standards (e.g. RS-JPO Interoperability, JAUS,
etc.) shall be implemented as necessary to permit adaption to various
platforms.  Potential commercial applications of this technology include
 commercial automotive.     DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Unmanned ground
vehicles have applications in numerous civilian domains, including
mining, autonomous driving, hazardous site inspection, site security,
and others.  It is expected that the software developed here would have
direct application in a variety of such domains.",

and Evaluation",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop an API and User Interface
for testing and evaluating the performance of perception systems for
autonomous vehicles.    DESCRIPTION:   Perception systems for autonomous
 vehicles are often tuned to a specific platform and thus will degrade
in performance if transferred to a different platform.  For example,
terrain costs are computed according to a fixed mapping from perceived
terrain to robot capabilities. This means that upgrades or damage to the
 underlying platform can severely affect performance.  Also, comparing
perception systems on a single platform or across platforms is hampered
by the lack of plug-and-play  capability in most perception systems and
tools for statistically meaningful evaluation.    The DARPA Learning
Applied to Ground Vehicles (LAGR) program addressed this shortcoming in
part by providing a single platform with a default control system and
planning module to which a perception  system could be added by plugging
 in a flash disk.  They system was not transferrable, however, to other
robot platforms, and there existed no common set of tools for evaluating
 the data collected by the robot.    It is desirable to be able to
evaluate the relative performance of perception systems before the
question of their effectiveness arises in the field. To this end, an
Application Programming Interface (API) and User Interface are sought
that will enable test of cross-platform generalizability of perception
systems. The API should provide an interfacing standard that will allow
perception systems to act as plug-ins to the autonomy software,
communicating with the standardized planning system and controls. The
user interface will enable an easy and intuitive way to conduct tests,
visualize results, and do comparative analysis.    PHASE 1:  Develop an
API that enables simple integration of any perception system following
the API's  interfacing guidelines onto a test autonomous platform.
Demonstrate on a COTS robot with a simple perception system doing ODOA
by interfacing with the robot's provided planning and control system.
Produce a design for a User Interface that enables visualization and
analysis of the performance of the perception system. Develop the
metrics to be used for comparison of systems.  These should include
metrics such as time-to-goal, number of hazards encountered, number of
human interventions required, and power consumption.  The Phase I
deliverables should include a final Phase I report documenting and
describing the API in the form of a software manual as well describing
the design of the User Interface.    PHASE II:  Develop the User
Interface software designed in Phase I to allow convenient measurement
and subsequent analysis of perception systems'performance including
cross comparison of perception systems. Use the API and User Interface
to demonstrate comparison of two perception algorithms across all

purpose of the API and User Interface is the evaluation and comparison
of perception systems across platforms.  To this end, extend this
demonstration to include application of the API to a second COTS
platform along with repeated demonstration of the two perception
algorithms on this new platform.    PHASE III:  Bring the User Interface
 to a commercial level.  Transition the work of Phase II to DOD test
centers and DoD development efforts that need to assess and pick the
most competent perception systems available.  Understanding the
limitations of existing perception systems is essential for properly
deploying them for the appropriate environments and tasks.  Potential

have humans collaborate effectively with autonomous systems, improved
interfaces and interaction techniques, and frameworks of interaction
must be developed that allow for a common perception of the goals,

 trusted human-machine teaming.  Development of better measures of human

human-cyber-physical system collaboration.  These systems are
necessarily complex with intricate interacting subsystems whose formal

testing through deep reasoning that is provided by cyber-physical
systems, humans, or their collaborative effort.    Beside the importance
 of algorithms, interactive visualization should also be designed for
displaying abstract information in a form comprehensible to humans,
assisting deep reasoning, understanding of cause-and-effect
relationships, verifying results output by cyber-physical systems,
facilitating workflow management.    Algorithms, information
representation, and interactive visualization designs must be based on
rigorous scientific principles.  In addition, novel ideas in
mathematics, statistics, and computer science are highly encouraged.
The performer should seek to demonstrate effective use of their proposed
 approaches in one of the following areas of cyber-physical systems:

Military Operations, Dynamic Logistics.    PHASE I:  Select one of the
above examples of cyber-physical systems that can support a DoD mission.

 commercial sector, this technology can provide seamless integration of
humans and machines or cyber-physical systems in different applications:
  air traffic control systems, health information technology, power
grids and mass transportation systems, etc.",

        "topic_name": "Knowledge-aided Interface for Big Data Streams",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative cognitive
knowledge-aided interface and supporting information processing
techniques to exploit very large data streams over wide areas and
autonomously highlight areas of interest for tactical decisions without a
 priori knowledge of the area and\/or location of high value.
DESCRIPTION:   Big data challenges across Department of Defense (DOD)
domains are increasingly problematic for tactical level decision making.
  Data collections in the open source and military channels are growing
at such a staggering rate that it exceeds our ability to store and
manage, perform computation and analysis, and maintain data security [1,
 2].  Indeed, one author refers to the inability to handle big data as
the new"helplessness age"[1], a reaction to the inability of information
 processing algorithms to rapidly extract key elements of information to
 aid decision making in time constrained environments.  Architectural
limitations are a major constraint to discovering knowledge from big
data stores that represent complex combinations of many data types [3].
 Due to the exponential increase in data, combined with the limitations
in processing capability, it is unlikely that Warfighters operating in
uncertain and unfamiliar cultural environments will benefit from
knowledge discovery capabilities any time soon.  To reduce vulnerability
 and risk for Warfighters from unknown threats, new and innovative
approaches are needed for data collection, processing, and user
interface designs.  Promising approaches in this space include data
streams [4], interactive exploration and hypothesis testing of data [5],
 and temporal segmentation of large text corpora [6].      Addressing
data stream computation is recognition that tactical decisions require a
 very small subset of all data available in military databases and that
valuable data may often be separate from the traditional hard sciences
approach to persistent collection and quantitative analysis [5].  In
data stream processing, data arrives in continuous, high-volume, fast
and time-varying streams [4].  Clustering, classification, and
association algorithms may be useful for mining data streams, but
transferring results over a wireless network with limited bandwidth
could prove challenging for tactical units [4].    Interactive
exploration and hypothesis testing of data streams could serve to filter
 large amounts of information for specific tactical knowledge
requirements.  Frequently, Warfighters don"t know the right questions to
 ask and have very limited opportunities to explore options for
potential outcomes.  Bio-inspired applications for interface design and
collaboration in a visual domain could improve interface designs.
Biological features that might be adapted to interfaces could include
autonomy, scalability, adaptability, and robustness [7], each designed
to detect data patterns, identify anomalies, and extract knowledge from
enormous volumes of data.  The key component of achieving success in
this particular problem area is to ensure that computer and social
scientists work closely together [1] in order to develop sufficiently
robust algorithms with greater reliance on reasoning that allow a
domain-relevant interpretation of actionable patterns of behavior and
meaning for informed decision making [2].      Temporal segmentation of
large text corpora may provide a method by which data may be filtered at
 tactical levels for rapid processing and knowledge extraction.  Using
text open sources (e.g., newspapers, blogs, Tweets, Facebook posts)
would provide Warfighters with near-real time insight into semantic
tones of localized text [6].  The potential value of this approach would
 be to allow users to infer a timeline of factors correlated with ideas
identified from analysis of public discussion in text corpora.      The
challenges with this topic are storage and management of big data, which
 may contribute to an inability to validate and qualify each data item.
Also, careful design of systems is necessary to match user needs and the
 technologies used for analytics and visual display of information.  In
addition, accessing very large quantities of semi- or unstructured data
is problematic and limited by available storage applications and
hardware. Finally, user needs must be supported by computational
processes, with these expressed in ways that are consistent with the
larger social system in which the user operates. Frequently, user
studies concentrate on the micro-system of the individual user and fail
to consider the wider range of opportunities, challenges, and
constraints.    The current topic seeks to address those challenges by
focusing on a new and innovative data collection\/storage\/processing
method that can reduce noise in large data while keeping relevant data
streams for processing.  It also will explore interactive user interface
 designs that allow temporal segmentation, or other useful algorithms,
which should consider bio-inspired applications.  Finally, placing the
user within the larger social system for developing filtering and visual
 methods will provide a unitary perspective for knowledge discovery and
dissemination.      PHASE I: Design an integrated approach for
interactive exploration of big data streams that allow users to
meaningfully interact with data and apply a variety of algorithmic
filters designed to facilitate rapid knowledge extraction.  Define
requirements for developing and implementing a technique that is
noticeably different from current fusion methods and that is useful for
large data streams.  Define a user scenario that considers a user in a
tactical setting and incorporates the larger social system that bounds
the knowledge extraction and dissemination process.  Provide
theoretically based and mathematically sound foundations for proposed
approaches that incorporate social and computational science.
Requirements definition must include: a description of the model
components and the supporting relationships, the computational
processing technique that will be used and a description of the
integration mechanisms, a determination of the types and characteristics
 of the metrics that will be captured and used, a detailed discussion of
 the specific domain to be represented, and a discussion of analysis and
 assessment techniques to be used.  Phase II plans should also be
provided, to include key component technological milestones and plans
for testing and validation of the proposed system and its components.
    PHASE II: Produce a prototype system based on the preliminary design
 from Phase I.  All appropriate engineering testing will be performed,
and a critical design review will be performed to finalize the design.
Phase II deliverables will include a working prototype of the system,
specification for its development, and a demonstration and validation of
 the ability to both accurately represent the model of the soft
information fusion and the collaborative visual analytics representation
 of the data.    PHASE III: This technology will have broad application
in military, government, and commercial settings.  Within the military
and government, there is an increasing emphasis on understanding and
forecasting group behaviors from social media and online social
communities in foreign nations that are potentially hostile to US and
Coalition interests.  Currently, fusing information from these sources
is extremely labor intensive and costly in terms of labor and time.
Developing interactive interfaces that can explore dynamic data streams
and extract knowledge rapidly will be a powerful addition to tactical
decision making.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research is to
use spatial, temporal and graph analysis techniques to take very large
data streams over wide areas and autonomously highlight areas of
interest for a decision maker without a priori knowledge of the area
and\/or location of high value.    DESCRIPTION: To protect U.S. national
 interests and achieve the objectives of the 2010 National Security
Strategy, the Joint Force will need to recalibrate its capabilities and
make selective additional investments [1]. The well-publicized push to
the Pacific Rim drives a need to improved mission planning over much
larger areas, including some for which conventional information
gathering is challenging.  Improved pattern recognition capabilities
enabled by spatial, temporal and graphical analysis are one way to
effectively improve mission planning and execution given limited
resourced.      The U.S. Marine Corp desires to improve battlespace
awareness (to know the enemy and environment) through improved analysis,
 prediction and production [2].  Relevant raw data can usually be stored
 and subsequently visualized spatially, temporally or as a graph.  The
automated recognition of an area and\/or location of high value is
basically a pattern recognition problem that must be solved in the
absence of a data that is naturally tied to a uniform grid.  Data about
remote areas can still include imagery, radar and open source which can
include social and cultural information.  The diversity of this data set
 makes the establishment of the uniform grid often required by pattern
recognition algorithms challenging [3].  The extraction and
preprocessing of features from raw data is also challenging due to the
well-known influences of environmental, social and cultural influences
on the importance of other observed features [4].  Cognitive processes
and context need to be considered by location\/area of interest pattern
recognition algorithms. [5]     The technical challenges of this topic
are as follows: 1) Select and automate the population of a feature
layer; 2)  Preprocess data as required to approximate a uniform grid; 3)
 uncover linear\/ nonlinear correlations between environmental, social
and cultural variables and feature importance; 4)  Mature models for
why\/when a location\/area would be of interest; 5)  Mature pattern
recognition algorithms that approximate human recognition and
classification skills utilizing cognitive insight; 5) provide a means to
 visualize current and predicted states (e.g. heat maps showing
locations\/areas of interest given a context). Define and apply metrics
to measure modeling and prediction accuracy and potential for success of
 products produced.     Creative solutions are desired. Data used should
 be relevant to potential use for product transition, such as a
government agency, program of record or commercial market place. Use of
open standards is encouraged to reduce costs and improve system
interoperability.    PHASE I:  Identify a geographic region for study
and data layer design concept.  Demonstrate that diverse types of data
can be ported to a spatial grid structure relevant to pattern
recognition.  Develop features models for areas of interest and then
perform a proof of concept demonstration of a pattern recognition
capability.  The demonstration should be conducted using open source
data.  Document results from analysis and tests in a technical report or
 paper at a selected conference. The final Phase I brief should show
plans for Phase I Option 1 and Phase II.    PHASE II:  Produce a
prototype system that is capable of rapidly identifying locations\/areas
 of interest based on a given context and visualizing that information
as spatial heat maps with data traceability.  The system should be able
to automatically process data as sequential batch files or streaming
data, accepting all standard raw data formats for images, maps, tracks,
text and graphs. It is desired that context and pedigree of information
be maintained for operator review. At this point the performer should
focus on a proof-of-concept of capability of interest to transition
program.     PHASE III:  Produce a system capable of deployment and
operational evaluation.  The system should consume available operational
 data sets and focus on areas that are of interest to specific
transition programs or commercial applications.  Machine based
processing steps and metadata should be accessible by operator and
presented in human understandable form. The software and hardware should
 be modified to operate in accordance with guidelines provided by
transition sponsor.",

Performance, Durability, and Economy",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate an advanced
high pressure, heavy fuel (JP-8) injection system for UAS\/UGS
applications, capable of performing multiple injections per cycle.
DESCRIPTION:  This effort is to develop a fast responding, light weight,
 direct injection system to operate within the fuel"s ignition delay
time for UAS\/UGS application.  These systems must be applicable to
engines that are 200 HP or less, either reciprocating or rotary. A
technical challenge associated with the conversion of gasoline engines
to heavy fuel (JP-8) is the avoidance of knock.  An approach used to
avoid knock is to operate within the fuel"s ignition delay time; hence
to employ direct combustion chamber injection.      The challenges of
the reciprocating engine are to avoid end gas knock (auto ignition
occurring in the end gas after spark) and to inject the fuel very late
into the cycle.  The challenges for the rotary engine are atomization
and the avoidance of wall quenching due to its combustion chamber shape.
  Delaying the injection process causes higher pressure rise rates which
 can exceed the engine"s design capabilities.  An injection system that
offers fast response and multiple injections per cycle may alleviate
excessive pressure rise and the avoidance of knock.     Good combustion
control eliminates many durability issues from overloading, shock, and
combustion deposits.  The shape of the combustion trace can be tailored
through multiple injection pulses and combustion deposits can be
controlled with better atomization and fuel patterns.  Hence an
injection system that offers fine atomization, fast response, and
multiple injections per cycle is needed.  System components are to
include injectors, high pressure supply pump (1000 bar min), feed pump
and controller with harness.    PHASE I:  Develop an improved fuel
injector capable of performing multiple injections per cycle, operating
at high pressures (above 1000 bar) and producing droplet sizes finer
than 10 to 15 microns.  These injectors will result in improvements to
the direct injection process for reciprocating and rotary UAS engines.
Analytical predictions of spray pattern through Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD) and 3-D computations are desired.  Bench tests of fuel
system components operating at designed pressures and quantification of
injection spray pattern are desired.  The fuel injection system should
have the capability to perform multiple injections per cycle and at
engine operating speeds up to 6,000 rpm.    PHASE II:  Demonstrate and
validate the performance of the Phase I technology in a laboratory
environment on a representative engine. Engines should be of size and
power appropriate for the Predator and Shadow-200 UAV class.  Further
analytical modeling and spray tests must supplement engine testing.  The
 avoidance of knock while operating on JP-8 and delivering equivalent
power is the desired outcome.    PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:
Military Application:  This technology is applicable to Air Force, Navy,
 and Army small, heavy fuel engines currently under development. The
conversion and design of heavy fuel engines necessitates high responding
 injectors capable of fine atomization, fast response, and multiple
injections per cycle. These injectors have the potential to be
incorporated into engines such as the USAF"s Predator-Rotax 914 and the
US Army"s Shadow-200 to minimize damaging effects of knock and to avoid
wall quenching through fine atomization.  Commercial Application:  This
technology has additional transition opportunities in the commercial
sector for ground vehicles or civil UAVs. Companies could incorporate
the injectors, high pressure supply pump, feed pump and controller with
harness to optimize the fuel injection associated with the engines. This
 could lead to cleaner combustion that could greatly increase the life
of the engine. Further, advanced direct injections systems have the
potential to reduce specific fuel consumption.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop sealing technologies for
heavy fuel engines for Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA).  The technology
should address sealing in engine classes of reciprocating and rotary

existing RPA systems include durability issues associated with engine
seals. Two key RPA systems in the DoD inventory are the USAF's Predator
and US Army's Shadow-200. Both of these systems have seal\/wear issues.
In the reciprocating engine - it's the piston - cylinder interface, and
in the rotary engine it's the rotor - housing interface. Sealing systems
 which have high wear resistance, light weight, and have high thermal
stability are sought.     Future, advanced engines for small RPA"s are
expected to make use of new materials, such as: ceramics, advanced
metallics, composites, and other lightweight materials. This will
require the development of new sealing technologies that are compatible
with the materials used in these advanced engines. Such efforts are in
the initial stages of development, exemplified by a program to replace
the metallic rotor in a rotary (Wankel) engine, with a silicon nitride
rotor. Other engine developments such as the Nutating engine and
Migrating Combustion Chamber (MCC) are under development and are
developing new lightweight materials to optimize the combustion systems
in these engines. Considerations are to examine an array of tribologic
factors, such as surface hardness, surface coating, and
self-lubrication.     Improvements are sought to address the
wear\/durability issues; specifically for the apex seal\/rotor\/housing
of the rotary engine, piston\/ring\/cylinder for reciprocating engines,
and other sealing technologies for innovative engines. Furthermore,
these wear\/durability issues must address engines running on heavy fuel
 (JP-8 and\/or diesel fuel) and have such characteristics to increase
the time between overhauls.    PHASE I:  Determine common combustion
seal material issues between piston ring\/cylinder interface for
reciprocating engines, apex seal\/trochoid housing for rotary engines,
and other sealing technologies for innovative engines. Items to be
identified include: relative speed between sealing surfaces, loading,
estimate of friction coefficients and lubrication. Develop concepts and
material combinations to address these issues. Activities included in
this phase consist of analytical modeling and small scale coupon testing
 to show proof of concept.     PHASE II:  The Phase II effort would
consist of selecting material combinations from those identified in
Phase I and conducting controlled bench tests to evaluate the
combinations for each different engine applications in terms of:
relative surface speed, loading between seal face and housing\/cylinder,
 level of lubrication, and temperature at the sealing surface.  These
material and sealing designs are to be demonstrated in representative
UAV engines.     PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:   Military
Application:  Advanced sealing concepts for small, heavy fuel engines
are applicable to the Air Force, Navy, and Army forces. Each service of
the DoD operates RPAs that are powered with small engines. Incorporating
 advanced sealing concepts into RPAs such as the USAF"s Predator-Rotax
914 engine and the US Army"s Shadow-200 has the potential to increase
engine efficiencies, reliability, and durability.  Commercial
Application:  This technology has additional transition opportunities in
 the commercial sector for small engines, ground vehicles and equipment,
 and lightweight power generation. Incorporating advanced sealing
technologies into commercial engines has the capability for companies to
 change material interfaces to increase engine efficiencies.
Furthermore, this technology is applicable to hybrid applications.",

UAV Engine Durability\/Performance",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To develop, and demonstrate
improvements in cooling capability of propulsion systems currently in
use on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); to show a 20% reduction in
cooling efficiency.    DESCRIPTION:  Two of the most popular UAVs used
in the US are the US Air Force"s Predator, and the US Army"s Shadow 200.
  The US Air Force Predator is classified as a medium altitude, long
endurance UAV and is powered by a 100 HP 4-cylinder piston engine.  The
US Army"s Shadow 200 is a tactical UAV and is powered by a 38 HP rotary
engine.  Both of these propulsion systems suffer durability issues which
 can be linked to undesirable heat transfer within the engine.
Moreover, desired increases in engine power or improvements in engine
efficiency are limited by thermal loading in the engine.    This topic
will focus on the development of improved cooling methodologies for the
above mentioned engines.  The piston engine relies primarily on liquids
as the cooling medium (oil and engine coolant) while the rotary engine
rejects heat directly to the airstream.  A solution is sought to better
manage internal heat transfer which can be applied to either engine.
Proposed solutions should be consistent with the desire to increase
engine power, improve engine efficiency, and be compatible with heavy
fuels.  As the engine is to be used in flight, the following constraints
 apply: 1) minimal or no increase in the frontal area. 2) minimal or no
increase to the installed weight of the propulsion assembly.     PHASE
I:  Define and determine innovative technologies that will result in
improvements to the engine cooling with minimal frontal area\/weight
impact. Demonstrate the feasibility of the approach through a detailed
design.  Identify the impact to the engine installation in terms of
weight and bulk. Estimate improvements to the engine which may be
realized by incorporation of the technology, specifically increases in
power output (brake mean effective pressure, BMEP), improvements in
efficiency (brake specific fuel consumption, BSFC), or durability (time
between overhaul, TBO).  A demonstration of hardware or
fabrication\/test of key components is desired.     PHASE II:
Demonstrate and validate performance improvements based on the Phase I
technology on representative engine. Fabricate and bench test (as
appropriate) prototype hardware or modifications. Conduct baseline
testing on an in-service UAV engine incorporating the new technology.
Refine the design and develop a plan leading to production-ready
hardware.    PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:   Military Application:
Advanced thermal management systems are applicable to the Air Force,
Navy, and Army. An increase in thermal management of engines could lead
to increase life of engine components, and, thus, possibly a large cost
savings per engine. This could be directly applicable to heavy fuel
engines currently under development, such as the USAF"s Predator-Rotax
914 engine and the US Army"s Shadow-200 using the UEL AR741.
Commercial Application:  Current commercial applications aim for an
increase in engine power, and an increase in engine power leads to an
increase in heat transfer to engine components. Advanced thermal
management systems offer the ability to minimize heat transfer to engine
 components. Further, this topic will incorporate thermal systems
without a large increase in engine weight or size, which can be made
directly applicable to the commercial market.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Improve UAS engine durability by
applying advanced designs\/materials for bearing, housing, and rotating
components\/systems.      DESCRIPTION:  UAS propulsion systems currently
 suffer from durability issues resulting in frequent overhauls.
Incorporating advanced durability systems could lead to longer durations
 between engine overhaul times and increased engine life, resulting in a
 larger payback per UAV investment. These advanced durability systems
can be applied to bearings, rotating components and static components in
 order to increase the life and times between overhauls.     Bearings
are an essential part of all UAV systems. As technologies continue to
advance in current air vehicles, more demands are being made on bearing
capability. With an increase in the demand of bearing capacity comes an
increased risk of bearing fatigue and wear caused by heavier loading,
inadequate\/unsuitable lubrication and overheating.  Future engine
improvements need to incorporate advanced bearing designs and concepts
to increase bearing durability and, thus, increase time between overhaul
 for UAV systems. Examples of advanced durability concepts include but
are not limited to ceramic ball bearings and fuel lubricated bearings.
Ceramic ball bearings have advantages of higher operating speeds,
increased stiffness, lower friction, and less heat generation. The
incorporation of ceramic bearings into UAV systems has the capability to
 reduce wear on the bearings through an increase in engine durability.
Further, fuel (JP-8) lubricated bearings offer substantial benefits
resulting from the elimination of the conventional recirculating
lubrication system.    Metal matrix composites (MMC) offer added
strength and durability that can be incorporated in both static
components such as engine housings and rotating components, where
ceramic matrix composites (CMC) also offer benefits with respect to heat
 transfer in the engine housing and reduction in engine weight. The
benefits offered by composite and ceramic materials are high
strength-to-weight ratios, high temperature tolerance, low coefficients
of thermal expansion, low coefficients of friction, and favorable
lubrication properties. The high strength-to-weight ratio is a favorable
 property for engine components as it reduces the rotational mass of the
 engine and increases the specific power. The low coefficients of
expansion of these materials allow tighter tolerances between moving and
 static components of the engines, which could lead to increased
durability and longer engine life. Applications for this technology
include engine liners, coatings for combustion surfaces, bearing cages
and housings, rotating shafts, pistons, and rotors.      PHASE I:
Define and determine advanced durability systems that can be
incorporated into bearings, rotating components, and static components
of engines to increase durability of current UAV propulsion systems.
This may include but is not limited to ceramics, metal matrix
composites, ceramic matrix composites, fuel (JP-8) lubricated bearings,
and ceramic ball bearings. Applications should be oriented to UAV
propulsion systems with the intent to increase engine durability and
reliability upon implementation of these advanced durability concepts.
Present day durability parameter for tactical UAV propulsion is $150\/hr
  a 20% improvement is sought.    PHASE II:  Apply the concepts
researched and developed in Phase I to a current UAV propulsion system.
The advanced durability system should be incorporated in a relevant UAV
engine and demonstrated in a laboratory environment. Small scale testing
 of these engines should show increased durability upon the
implementation of advanced durability systems.     PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS:   Military Application:  This technology is applicable to
Air Force, Navy, and Army UAV systems. By implementing advanced
durability systems such as ceramic bearings, fuel lubricated bearings,
and composite structures, the durability of each UAV can be greatly
increased, increasing overhaul time and operation for each aircraft.
This has significant cost and efficiency savings for the DoD.
Commercial Application:  This technology has additional transition
opportunities in the commercial sector. Performance is a key factor in
the commercial industry and with an increase in performance of small
engines comes durability issues such as fatigue and overheating of
engine components. By applying advanced durability systems to the
rotating components, static components, and bearings of commercial
engines, performance can be greatly increased.",

 which eliminate the use of oil lubrication for the bearing system is
needed.  Furthermore, current UAS systems are experiencing durability
issues with turbochargers due to oil coking.  Light weight forced
induction systems with improved bearing and lubrication circuits are
sought for the 50 to 150 HP UAS class.    The bearing systems in
turbochargers and superchargers are normally oil-fed from the engine
oiling system.  The bearings in these systems run in an extremely harsh
environment and are subjected to axial, radial and thermal loads that
limit the life of the turbocharger system and can cause failures during
important mission sorties.  The elimination of the pressurized oil
bearing system would greatly enhance reliability and durability and
decreases losses of aircraft that are employing turbochargers and
superchargers.  There are a number of engines that could use
turbocharger technology but some do not have pressurized oiling systems.
  Even systems that have pressurized oiling systems suffer from pumping
losses due to the oiling system having to supply oil to the turbocharger
 and supercharger. Additionally, when operating at high angles of
attack, the pressurized oil systems may not provide adequate lubrication
 for the bearing systems.  Having a system that optimizes the ability to
 place the turbocharger or supercharger in airframe positions that are
not possible with a pressurized oiling system is a must.     Lastly, the
 forced induction system should be light weight and reliable.  The
weight should less than 5% of the overall engine system.     PHASE I:
Develop a design concept for turbo\/supercharger systems that are light
weight, durable, and self-lubricated including bearing and material
selection.  The design should consider forced induction loading, thermal
 loads, and operating speeds. Reliability and durability performance
parameters should be part of the analysis and potential bench top
testing of candidate systems should be performed in Phase I.     PHASE
II:  This phase builds off the progress made in Phase I to incorporate
the bearing system in an advanced turbo\/supercharger and demonstrate it
 in an operational UAS propulsion system. This will include analytical
modeling, the appropriate bench testing for system integration, and an
engine demonstration.       PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  Military
Application:  Advanced turbocharger\/supercharger technologies are
directly applicable to the Army, Air Force, and Navy. This advanced
technology allows for an increase in power for small engine classes,
leading to more mission capability. It also allows turbochargers to be
incorporated into current systems without pressurized oil systems that
previously would not be able to increase power through a conventional
turbocharger system.  Commercial Application:  The advanced
turbocharger\/supercharger technology is applicable to commercial
applications. Lightweight turbochargers can be incorporated into small
engines to increase power without significantly effecting engine size
and weight. Further, the elimination of the pressurized oil bearing
system on turbochargers would allow for enhanced reliability and
durability on commercial engines.",

        "topic_name": "Development of Innovative Welding for High
Performance Bridge Steel",
        "description": "\n\tSteel bridge fabrication has changed little
since the 1950s when welding steel began to dominate over
riveting.&amp;nbsp; The recent 20 years has seen two innovations in
steel bridge fabrication.&amp;nbsp; One has been the advent of high
performance steels (HPS) in the mid-1990s that provided higher yield
strengths, higher fracture toughness, and most importantly, an increased
 weldability over conventional grades of bridge steel.&amp;nbsp; Two,
was the official adoption of electroslag welding into the American
Welding Society (AWS) D1.5 Bridge Welding Code in 2010.&amp;nbsp;
Elecroslag welding is one of five welding processes recognized by AWS
for steel bridge fabrication, but the majority of steel bridge
fabrication still uses the submerged arc welding (SAW)
process.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tOne of the most time consuming
welds to make in bridge fabrication are butt splices between standard
mill plates to create plates longer than the steel mill can
deliver.&amp;nbsp; Typical practice would be to use multi-pass SAW to
make these joints and this becomes quite costly when the plate thickness
 is greater than 1 inch due to the extensive preparation, number of
passes, and volume of weld metal.&amp;nbsp; For instance, to butt weld a
 typical 3 inch thick by 30 inch wide girder flange would take 15 hours
with SAW.&amp;nbsp; Electroslag welding is specifically tailored for
welding thick plates together in a single pass, and the same flange
could be welded in 30 minutes.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, electroslag welds
 have a much lower propensity for developing internal weld defects which
 can plague SAW leading to costly repairs and time
delays.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tCurrently AWS D1.5 precludes electroslag
welding of HPS grades of steel and for all fracture-critical members,
because the process was never demonstrated for these
applications.&amp;nbsp; The specific concern with elecroslag welding HPS
 is the very high heat input having deleterious effects on the heat
treatment of the HPS steels.&amp;nbsp; The previously developed
electroslag process consumables and welding conditions may have to be
modified for joining HPS to ensure that welded joints have no rejectable
 discontinuities and will have adequate strength and toughness in both
the weld metal and heat-affected zones of the welded
joints.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe productivity of electroslag welding has
 the potential to speed up steel bridge fabrication and using HPS
material can increase the reliability of new bridges.&amp;nbsp; However,
 there has yet to be a synthesis of these two innovations to work
together, and further electroslag weld process development must be
performed so the process can be proven viable for joining of HPS to HPS,
 as well as hybrid welding of HPS to conventional bridge
steel.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tWhile electroslag is one of the
methods that can be used to achieve this result, other innovative
welding methods will also be considered.&amp;nbsp; However, other
methods should consider that standard mill widths of steel plate are 72,
 96, and 120 inches wide and hence, the longest welds for the process
will be this range.&amp;nbsp; The lengths of plate being fused could be
as long as 85 feet too, so other innovative processes should consider
feasibility of handling plates of these sizes during welding.&amp;nbsp;
In addition, technologies beyond electroslag shall be more efficient, in
 regards to the total time to create a weld, than SAW at plate
thicknesses over 1 inch. The finished weld should also have no
rejectable discontinuities and will have adequate strength and toughness
 in both the weld metal (if used) and heat-affected zones of the welded
joints.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe developed process will meet the FHWA
National Leadership goal of advancing innovation by bringing together
two existing technologies to help expand steel bridge fabrication
possibilities, along with reducing fabrication costs and lead
time.&amp;nbsp; Once the process innovation is complete, it is expected
that welding equipment manufacturers will be able to sell more machines
to steel bridge fabricators, and steel bridge fabricators will become
more competitive with the efficiency gains from electroslag or other
innovative welding processes.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase I
Outcomes:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe objective of this phase is to conduct
 a feasibility study to explore and identify innovative welding process
variables and\/or consumables for application to HPS. The two areas of
concentration will be (1) research consumable chemistry requirements, if
 required, and the resulting weld metal chemistry to achieve (a) the
correct strength level per grade and (b) a weld metal microstructure
with the maximum level (at least that of meeting Zone 2 requirements) of
 impact toughness, and (2) identifying processes that will reduce the
heat input to a minimum level that can be used consistently and
practically to achieve quality welds in a production environment. This
phase may include production of trial
welds.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase II Outcomes:\n\n\tPhase II
will include the production of trial welds (if not already performed as
part of the Phase I).&amp;nbsp; The Phase II outcomes build upon the
lessons learned in Phase I and will result in full optimization
development of innovative welds between HPS and HPS, and HPS to
conventional steel through a rational testing matrix of trial welds
looking at the critical variables identified in Phase I.&amp;nbsp;\n",

        "topic_name": "Affiliation Strength\/Risk Model Development for
Motor Carrier Succession",
        "description": "\n\tThe Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration (FMCSA) is responsible for regulating the safety of
interstate truck and bus travel in the United States. The primary
mission of FMCSA is to reduce crashes, injuries and fatalities involving
 large trucks and buses.FMCSA&amp;rsquo;s strategic framework is built
upon three core principles:\n\n\t\n\t\tRaise the bar to enter the
industry;\n\t\n\t\tRequire operators to maintain high safety standards
to remain in the industry; and\n\t\n\t\tRemove high-risk operators from
our roads and highways.\n\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe vetting process
implemented within the FMCSA&amp;rsquo;s Office of Registration and
Safety Information supports all of these initiatives by assuring that
new applicants meet FMCSA&amp;rsquo;s standards for fitness,
willingness, and ability to comply with all applicable federal statutes
and regulations by checking for signs that a new applicant is not a
reincarnated version of an existing high-risk operator. These
initiatives set a high bar to obtain operating authority and close
loopholes for those high risk operators to reincarnate themselves with a
 clean slate and, hence, keep them off public
highways.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tFMCSA already employs a proprietary
risk-based screening process which uses a sophisticated matching
algorithm to screen and assign risk to an applicant using primarily
federal sources of data. This solicitation is seeking innovative
approaches, alternate methods and public\/private data sources to
confirm or further expand robust automation methods that are part of its
 screening process.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe primary purpose of this
topic is for the Offeror to use operating authority application
information specified on the application form (See References 1 and 2)
and compare it to the similar information on file for a list of motor
carriers and identify the probability of potential affiliation between
the applicant and each of the carriers of interest (i.e. development of a
 robust affiliation strength model with use of publicly available data
sources).\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tFMCSA is primarily interested
in\n\n\t\n\t\tSurveying of publicly available data sources (such as
States&amp;rsquo; data) that can be automatically cross-checked against
that can validate submitted information or hint for potential
affiliations;\n\t\n\t\tSurveying of affiliation strength\/risk models
that may be used in other business models or by other Federal or State
Agencies;\n\t\n\t\tIdentification of private data that could provide
incremental benefits;\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment and use of complex matching
algorithms that may take into account typos, different abbreviations,
use of short names, text order differences;\n\t\n\t\tConfirmation of
application data validity to the extent possible such as business
address;\n\t\n\t\tUse of web-search algorithms that can be automatically
 assimilated into useful measures;\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment and use of
probability measures for assessing affiliation strength;
and\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of a self-learning framework and adaptive
methods to automatically update the model parameters based on
application disposition decisions.\n\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe Contractor
 will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement to receive sample
data which can be used to develop and test out proposed methods. There
are about 50,000 applications per year, each of which would need to be
automatically processed for affiliation strength assessment with respect
 to a list of other motor carriers of interest which may be a subset of
the ~725,000 motor carriers to be specified by FMCSA. Each application
would not need to be checked against all motor carriers of interest and
the Offeror would have latitude to further scope down the screening
methodologies intelligently based on the research conducted within this
project.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe entire solution would need to be fully
 automated. It would need to input a set of text fields from an
applicant and a set of text fields from an existing company and use the
underlying company information and the identified public sources of
information to output a probability measure of affiliation strength
between the two companies. The algorithm must run reasonably fast such
that one application can be batch processed against a large number of
potential other companies and the entire automatic assessment process
can be completed in reasonable time (reasonable level to be defined
jointly between the Contractor and FMCSA during Phase I).\n\n\tExpected
Phase I Outcomes:\n\n\tOutcomes expected from the Phase 1 include
surveying and documentation of all available public and private data
sources and uses of other affiliation strength\/risk models. In
addition, a detailed concept that demonstrates the viability of
developing complex affiliation risk model that would work within the
context of FMCSA&amp;rsquo;s needs is expected to be delivered.
Computational needs and processing time assessments will have to be
quantified. Expected ranges of effectiveness measures would need to be
developed.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase II Outcomes:\n\n\tPhase 2
 efforts would prototype the Contractor&amp;rsquo;s approach to validate
 the affiliation risk model. Furthermore, a detailed experimental plan
for assessing the efficacy of the solution would be formulated along
with updated cost-benefit projections based on development
activities.\n",

Pre-Drivers, Young Drivers, and Older Drivers to Detect Traffic Hazards
and Respond Appropriately",
        "description": "\n\tMotor vehicle crashes killed an average of
40,398 people in the U.S. each year from 2000 through 2010, despite
declines to 37,423 in 2008, 33,808 in 2009, and 32,885 in 2010 during
harsh economic conditions from which the country is slowly recovering
(National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2012).&amp;nbsp;As a
cause of death in the U.S. in 2009, traffic crashes ranked first among
both 5-14 and 15-24 year olds, third among 1-4 year olds, and fifth
among 25-44 year olds (Kochanek et al., 2011).&amp;nbsp; This human
tragedy is unacceptable and creative new approaches are
needed.&amp;nbsp; As researchers recently reported in the journal
Accident Analysis and Prevention:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tHazard perception
 in driving refers to a driver&amp;rsquo;s ability to anticipate
potentially dangerous situations on the road ahead ... This particular
ability has generated interest among the road safety community because,
to our knowledge, it is the only driving-specific skill found to be
associated with crash risk&amp;hellip;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tWe examined
the proposal that hazard perception ability is suboptimal even in highly
 experienced mid-age drivers. First, we replicated previous findings in
which police drivers significantly outperformed highly experienced
drivers on a validated video-based hazard perception test, indicating
that the ability of the experienced participants had not reached ceiling
 despite decades of driving. Second, we found that the highly
experienced drivers&amp;rsquo; hazard perception test performance could
be improved with a mere 20 min of video-based training, and this
improvement remained evident after a delay of at least a week. One
possible explanation as to why hazard perception skill may be suboptimal
 even in experienced drivers is a dearth of self-insight, potentially
resulting in a lack of motivation to improve this ability. Consistent
with this proposal, we found no significant relationships between
self-ratings and objective measures of hazard perception ability in this
 group. We also found significant self-enhancement biases in the
self-ratings and that participants who received training did not rate
their performance (either in real driving or in the test) as having
improved, contrary to what was indicated by their objective performance
data.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThus, current scientific findings
suggest the potentially substantial safety benefits of using technology,
 such as PC\/TV-based videogames and\/or driving simulator technology,
combined with a comprehensive traffic hazard-response database, to train
 pre-drivers, young drivers, and older drivers to detect and
appropriately respond to traffic hazards.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected
Phase I Outcomes:\n\n\tOutcomes expected from Phase 1 include a
feasibility study, design, and outline of a game-based technology
(software, hardware, or other), such as but not limited to&amp;nbsp; a
PC\/TV-based videogame or driving simulator, and a traffic
hazard-response database, to educate and train pre-drivers, young
drivers, and older drivers to detect and appropriately respond to a
variety of traffic hazards.&amp;nbsp; The feasibility study will
identify and summarize the main safety hazards for different subject
groups and propose corrective measures.&amp;nbsp; The study will also
identify potential customers for this product, which may include
insurance companies, driving schools, public school systems, safety
advocacy organizations and groups, etc.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected
Phase II Outcomes:\n\n\tOutcomes expected from Phase II include the
production and demonstration of a working prototype of the technology
studied during Phase I, and testing, field evaluation, and substantial
refinement of the prototype developed,&amp;nbsp; to maximize traffic
hazard detection and appropriate response rates, as well as the
long-term duration of enhanced traffic hazard detection and appropriate
response rates, among pre-driver, young driver, and older driver
populations as demonstrated by rigorous experimental methodology, data
reduction, statistical analysis, and exposition in a form suitable for
refereed journal publication.\n",

across the industry is for an inspection technology that can measure
longitudinal strain.&amp;nbsp; This Small Business Innovation Research

construction pipelines incorporating all types of
&amp;quot;foam&amp;quot; sack breakers and supports",
        "description": "\n\tWhen a pipeline is constructed a ditch is
dug to applicable depths based on federal regulation and is prepared for
 the pipeline that will be laid within the construction ditch. When the
pipeline is placed in the ditch it requires support and padding to
protect the coating and align it to the topography of the ditch in
preparation for back fill. There are many types of material that can be
used to provide support within the construction ditch. These supports
are typically constructed with sand bags, hay bales, oak cribbing, or
spayed urethane foam. Likewise, in the event that water enters the
construction ditch water breakers are used to prevent and sectionalized
any flowing water. This prevents flooding, washout, soil erosion, and
potential ditch collapse from happening. These water breakers are
typically constructed with sand bags or sprayed urethane foam.
Construction practices for ditch pipeline supports and water breaks
favor products that will satisfy the design requirements at the lowest
total cost over the life of the
project.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tWith the rising cost
of labor, materials, and transportation of sandbags for padding and
breakers during pipeline construction,&amp;nbsp;urethane foam breakers
and padding&amp;nbsp;have become&amp;nbsp;an economical solution
for&amp;nbsp;many&amp;nbsp;service owners and general
contractors.&amp;nbsp;Additionally, due to the fast pace of
today&amp;#39;s construction processes and the time constraints placed
on the completion of projects by pipeline owners due to service demands,
 the time saved by using sprayed foam breakers and padding&amp;nbsp;has
made it a popular alternative to&amp;nbsp;the traditional sandbag
method.&amp;nbsp;Time and money savings also appear in the general
contractor&amp;#39;s bottom line, since backfill crews and machinery
will reduce down time due to the waiting period involved with installing
 sandbag breakers, padding, or pipe support.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe
advantages of urethane foam over the use of sand bags include the
following:\n\n\t\n\t\tFoam barriers do
not&amp;nbsp;deteriorate&amp;nbsp;or degrade&amp;nbsp;over time like
sandbags;\n\t\n\t\tUrethane foam conforms to any shape or configuration
of ditch and offers the advantage of immediate
backfill;\n\t\n\t\tUrethane foam pillow pads will compress and conform
to the pipe with a weight load whereas sandbags (especially frozen ones)
 may dent the pipe;\n\t\n\t\tUrethane foam greatly reduced
transportation cost to the job site;\n\t\n\t\tAdditional savings will
come in the future as the cost of pipeline upkeep and maintenance will
be reduced; and\n\t\n\t\tSince foam breakers are sprayed around the pipe
 in-place, they adhere to the pipe itself and only move if the pipe
moves.\n\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tAlong with the design considerations (such
 as length, width, the depth of foam needed to support a pipeline filled
 with water without denting the pipe, and the minimum clearance above
rock) pipeline operators must ensure their pipelines meet Federal
regulations for natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline safety
regulations on corrosion prevention as related to cathodic protection
(CP). Since urethane foams are highly dielectric the possibility of
shielding CP is high. Other concerns in the use of urethane foams are
structural integrity, water infiltration of the foam, and potential
buoyant forces in saturated ground or rising water tables.&amp;nbsp; The
 foam should be reviewed for durability to support the pipeline weight
over the operational life of the pipeline. For reference, applicable
Federal pipeline safety regulations are listed

challenge&amp;ndash; Proposals are being sought to develop a model that
analyses and quantifies the CP penetration, as related to the Pipeline
Safety CP requirements, through all types and sizes of
&amp;ldquo;foam&amp;rdquo; sack breakers and supports. The model must
take into consideration foam type and the length and thickness of
breakers and\/or supports. The model must also take into consideration
the exposure to a variety of soil types and conditions, including but
not limited to moisture content, temperature, and depth of cover. An
ideal model would have the following attributes:\n\n\t\n\t\tDielectric
leakage considerations for the foam sack breakers and supports in
addition to the soil and surrounding conditions.\n\t\n\t\tPredetermined
look up tables for known resistance values of given
materials.\n\t\n\t\tA visual display of diagramed configuration with
various paths of CP values.\n\t\n\t\tDurability of the foam material to
support the pipe over the operational life of the pipeline.\n\t\n\t\tThe
 effects of buoyancy force from the foam padding or water break
structure when in saturated soil or within rising water table on the

foam.\n\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase I Outcomes:\n\n\tA

evaluation methods to quantify remaining strength of line pipe steel and
 or pipeline fittings",
        "description": "\n\tThe U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
Title 49, Parts 192 and 195 stipulates that ASME B31G or RSTRENG be used
 to assess the remaining strength of corroded pipe. A review of existing
 burst test data raised some concerns that use of these methods can, in
some instances, result in predicted failure pressures that are greater
than the recorded burst pressures from actual tests. No burst testing
data exist on steel pipeline fittings.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tIndustry has
 also researched methods for assessing the remaining strength of
corroded pipelines. This has led to the development of new criteria and
has extended the range of assessment methods to include numerical
analysis. While there has been substantial progress, there are areas
where the existing criteria require improvements, including steel
pipeline fittings. Issues identified include limitations on the
interaction of closely spaced defects, the effects of external loading,
and cyclic pressure loading. Furthermore, as operators start to use
higher strength materials, there will be an increasing need to assess
the integrity of high strength steel pipeline fittings that have been
corroded while further validating the application of existing criteria
and models for these materials.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPast work by
industry and the U.S. Department of Transportation&amp;rsquo;s Pipeline
and Hazardous Safety Administration (PHMSA) has funded research to
address these issues in recent years on pipeline steels. The work has
included a program of materials testing, finite element (FE) analyses,
and full scale burst testing to develop methods for assessing corrosion
damage in pipelines of strength grade up to X100. Reports from this work
 are available at:
http:\/\/primis.phmsa.dot.gov\/matrix\/PrjHome.rdm?prj=171\n\t\n\tBackground:
 \n\t\n\tCorrosion metal loss is one of the major damage mechanisms to
transmission pipelines worldwide. A corrosion metal-loss defect further
reduces the strength of the damaged pipeline sections while introducing
localized stress and strain concentrations. Several methods have been
developed for assessing the remaining strength of corroded pipelines,
such as the ASME B31G and RSTRENG models. These models were derived from
 experimental tests and theoretical\/numerical studies of the failure
behavior of corroded pipelines. The test pipes contained either
corrosion metal-loss defects or simulated metal-loss defects and
featured materials with relatively high toughness properties for X65 and
 above and lower toughness properties for X60 and below. The early burst
 tests used vintage pipe with low toughness properties. Plastic
deformation and collapse of the ligament or surrounding material
determines the failure behavior of the corroded pipe. In principle, the
existing assessment methods are only applicable to pipelines with
toughness levels that are sufficient to prevent a toughness-dependent
failure.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe research completed did not include
analysis of burst test data on steel line pipe with real corrosion
defects in strength grades above X65, as the data were not
available.&amp;nbsp; To address this gap, a focused program of
full-scale tests is recommended on higher strength line pipe of strength
 grades above X65 with electro-chemically induced, simulated corrosion
defects. These defects can be produced using electrochemical means to
approximate real corrosion in the field, as opposed to flat-bottomed
rectangular machined patches. Failure pressure predictions using ASME
B31G, Modified ASME B31G, and RSTRENG should then be compared to the
recorded burst test pressures to confirm that these methods are
applicable for higher strength pipelines.
\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tMechanical properties of pipe metal help define
the principal characteristics of its technical state. These properties
can change (degrade) during long-term operation not as a result of an
aging process but rather from exposure to cyclic pressures, extreme
temperatures, excessive forces or detrimental environmental conditions.
&amp;nbsp;Heat input during the coating process may change these
properties on the pipe surface but not necessarily throughout the
thickness of the pipe wall. Developing new methods for pipeline
technical diagnosis and evaluating a line pipe&amp;rsquo;s actual
technical state will help ensure the pipe&amp;#39;s safe lifetime
operation.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tSub-topic challenge&amp;ndash; Proposals
 are being sought for the development of future guidance and
consideration of the background factors described above. The descriptive
 physical model of impact strength change effect on the
pipeline&amp;rsquo;s actual technical state needs to be investigated.
The objective of this sub-topic is to determine the next steps after an
operator determines the mechanical properties of the steel line pipe and
 or pipeline fittings are insufficient. Issues to specifically be
considered when developing and demonstrating new non-destructive
evaluation methods can\/should include:\n\n\t\n\t\tIs hardness (other
method) a good indicator for remaining strength of steel line pipe and
or pipeline fittings?\n\t\n\t\tHow are variable steel properties in
thickness of material and at different surface locations taken into
account in determining strength?\n\t\n\t\tAre some example cut-out
calibration material samples required for determining uncertainties and
if so at what frequency?\n\t\n\t\tWhat are the recommended procedures to
 be used and uncertainties?\n\t\n\t\tWill hardness testing be an
iterative process to be conducted at various time or distance
intervals?\n\t\n\t\tHow does the intended methodology assess and
evaluate the threat?\n\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProposals may consider the
following attributes:\n\n\t1.&amp;nbsp; The variation of mechanical
properties resulting from changes in the operational parameters.
Long-term operating conditions in corroded pipe may lead to the
degradation of stress and strain resistance capacity of the material and
 an increasing sensitivity to stress concentrators and
defects.\n\n\t2.&amp;nbsp; The material steel rolling\/manufacturing
processes, chemical composition, any heat treatment for fittings, and
strength.\n\n\t3. The magnitude of critical brittle temperature, which
is the temperature where the nature of a material&amp;rsquo;s fracture
changes from ductile to brittle.&amp;nbsp; This temperature is
determined by fracture energy. It is determined by the energy used for
fracture. Impact strength value is the figure of this energy. The
reduction of impact strength could cause an increase of cold shortness
temperature to the range of operation temperature of pipeline
steels.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase I Outcomes:\n\n\tA
successful Phase I will demonstrate, through mathematical models and
scientific analysis, a determination as to whether hardness is a valid
indicator of remaining strength for pipe and or pipeline fittings.
\n\n\tExpected Phase II Outcomes:\n\n\tPhase II will include the
validation and testing of potential models that predict the remaining
strength of pipe and or pipeline fittings based on hardness or other
properties.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n",

        "description": "\n\tPurpose\n\n\tThe Eunice Kennedy Shriver
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
(NICHD)&amp;nbsp;and participating Institutes invite grant applications
for research on the development of safe, real-time, non-invasive (or
minimally invasive), in vivo methods to assess the development and
function of the human placenta.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tThe placenta is
essential for the maintenance of pregnancy. The prominent function of
the placenta is in the transfer of nutrients, gases and waste products
between the mother and fetus. It is effectively the lung, gut, and
kidney of the fetus. Abnormalities of placental development and function
 are known to underlie many major pathologies of pregnancy including
spontaneous preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and preeclampsia.
Most information on placental biology is obtained studying placental
tissue obtained from pathological pregnancies, such as a preterm
deliveries occurring predominately in the third trimester, or from term
deliveries in which placental development has already crested.&amp;nbsp;
 Hence, there is a paucity of information obtained earlier in gestation,
 a period of time when many of the pregnancy pathologies are believed to
 have their origins, as well as very limited information gleaned
throughout gestation from normal pregnancies. The development of
real-time, non-invasive (or minimally invasive) methods to assess the
development and functionality of the placenta in vivo throughout
gestation would serve as valuable research tools to enhance our
understanding of placental biology and rooted pathologies. The
development of these tools could lead to the identification of markers
and predictors of pregnancy outcome, and provide a future foundation for
 better pregnancy monitoring in the clinical setting.\n\n\tScope\/Work
to be Performed\n\n\tThis FOA is for the development of safe, real-time,
 non-invasive (or minimally invasive), in vivo methods to assess the
placenta to evaluate normal and abnormal development and function. These
 methods may include imaging or sensor technologies. The objective of
this FOA is to push the field beyond existing paradigms, such as in
vitro measurement of analytes obtained from maternal blood and\/or
Doppler velocimetry of the uterine arteries, both of which have been
associated with placental function. Applications for studies solely
measuring biomarkers using in vitro methods of placental
function&amp;nbsp;will not be considered responsive.&amp;nbsp;Similarly,
 studies focusing only on uterine artery Doppler waveforms as a measure
of placental perfusion would not be considered responsive. Projects that
 would be responsive to this FOA include novel methods as well as
adapting or optimizing current imaging or real-time analyte(s) sensing
technologies. In the case of imaging technologies, the development of
signaling markers, safe contrasting materials, and\/or software
enhancement will be deemed responsive. In regard to analyte sensors,
multiplexing analyte measurements is preferable. Special consideration
will be given to applications that develop methods that are applicable
throughout pregnancy, preferably starting in early gestation during the
period of trophoblast invasion and remodeling of the uterine spiral
arteries, and which also establish reference values. Other areas of
interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in
vivo methods to assess in vivo placental function.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment
of in vivo methods to assess in vivo placental
metabolism.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in vivo methods to measure placental
 nutrient transfer.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in vivo methods to measure
in vivo placental microvascular blood flow.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in
vivo methods to measure placental structural
development.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in vivo methods for the measurement
 of placental perfusion.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in vivo methods for the
 measurement of placental function in complicated pregnancies and
patterns of progression to disease states.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in
vivo methods for the spatial and temporal regional mapping of placental
function and association with placental histopathology in normal and
pathologic states.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in vivo methods for the
measurement of placental response to environmental stressors (e.g.
oxygen levels, tobacco exposure, maternal exercise, psychological
stress).\n\n\n\tHuman studies are preferable, but animal studies are
acceptable to evaluate proof of concept and the safety of methods that
are directly applicable for future translational studies in the
human.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;\n",

by P3 awardees with the commercial focus of SBIR.
&amp;nbsp;Specifically, a special funding opportunity (SFO) (which is in
 addition to the funding opportunity above) has been created to support
P3 teams that have formed small businesses. It is anticipated that
EPA\u2019s SBIR program will award $500,000 in firm fixed-price
contracts at a maximum dollar amount of $100,000 each. &amp;nbsp;Notice
that this special funding opportunity is available only to P3 awardees
that have formed small businesses. &amp;nbsp;To be considered for this
SFO, in addition to being a former or current P3 Phase I or Phase II
awardee, applicants must meet all applicable guidelines for SBIR
companies as described above. &amp;nbsp;In order to be eligible,
companies submitting proposals to this P3 SFO must identify their
specific P3 reference the P3 grant number(s), name the current
employee(s) that were on the original P3 team, and demonstrate direct
links among original P3 project, their current business and the project
being submitted under this SBIR solicitation. &amp;nbsp;At least one

 &amp;nbsp;Companies cannot have concurrent P3 and SBIR awards.\nP3
Background\nIncreased awareness and understanding of sustainability are
critical components for promoting a systematic shift towards more
environmentally benign and sustainable products, processes, and systems.
 It is essential that all involved in the design, discovery,
demonstration, and implementation of sustainable innovations understand
the fundamental techniques and principles that underlie
sustainability.&amp;nbsp;\nP3 focuses on scientific projects and
engineering designs that address the three components of sustainability:
 people, prosperity and the planet. The P3 Program is intended to
support science-based projects and designs developed by
interdisciplinary student teams that benefit people by improving their
quality of life, promote prosperity by developing local economies, and
protect the planet by conserving resources and minimizing
pollution.\nEPA\u2019s P3 Program has identified the following four
strategic program goals.\nGoal 1: Engage and educate the next generation
 of scientists, engineers, and the greater academic and external
communities in the principles of sustainability.\nGoal 2: Spark
innovation and sustainable technologies through research and development
 conducted by the P3 projects.\nGoal 3: Support the demonstration of
sustainable technologies around the world.\nGoal 4: Foster the
development of small businesses rooted in sustainability.\nMore about
information about the P3 program is available at P3: People, Prosperity

        "description": "\n\tPurpose\n\n\tThe purpose of this Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Grant program is to stimulate
technological innovation in the private sector, strengthen the role of
small business in meeting Federal research or research and development
needs, and improve the return on investment from Federally-funded
research for economic and social benefits to the Nation.\n\n\tNatural
products offer a diverse reservoir of biologically active
components.&amp;nbsp; The single chemical entities, as well as their
mixtures in natural product extracts, have a long history of use as
drugs, drug precursors, and\/or complementary health adjuvants. However,
 methodologies for the identification of bioactive natural products and
their mechanism(s) of pharmacological action are often inadequate or too
 time consuming to be compatible with modern screening
platforms.&amp;nbsp; Many existing biotechnologies could be adapted to
improve natural products research.&amp;nbsp; Innovative methods might
utilize genomics, bio-products engineering, bioinformatics, synthetic
and molecular biology, or nanotechnology. The purpose of this proposed
initiative is to improve upon the currently available natural products
methodologies thereby increasing the efficiency of research in this
field.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tNatural products are essential sources of
medicines.&amp;nbsp; The World Health Organization estimates that ~80%
of the world&amp;rsquo;s population relies on traditional medicines made
 from natural products. The modern pharmaceutical industry is also
dependent on plant-based medicines, with as much as 50% of all drugs
based on natural products or derived from a natural product origin.
Clearly, plants and other natural products offer excellent sources of
health-promoting medicines. Thus it is extremely important that our
capacity is enhanced to further examine these traditional modalities and
 achieve a solid scientific understanding of their potential health
benefits.\n\n\tNonetheless, substantial problems exist in identifying
and understanding natural products and their bioactivity.&amp;nbsp;
While the potential for natural products in health and wellbeing is
clear, the challenges that hamper the full utilization of these
resources are many, with the greatest hurdle simply being the enormous
amount of time and effort required for structure identification and
characterization of the mechanisms by which natural products exert their
 pharmacological activity. Improvements in collection, bioassay,
isolation, purification, de-replication, yield, and supply of natural
products are possible. While advances have been made to help overcome
these hurdles, there exist many new untapped technological resources
that may improve natural products research
methodologies.\n\n\tObjectives\n\n\tThe primary objective of this FOA is
 to help move useful technologies from non-commercial laboratories into
the commercial marketplace by inviting SBIR grant applications from
small businesses for further development of such technologies that are
relevant to the missions of the sponsoring NIH institutes and centers.
The supported research and development will likely include making the
tools more robust and easy to use, and require close collaboration
between the original developers of these technologies and SBCs. These
partnerships may be accomplished in any of a number of ways, including
the use of multiple principal investigators.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;Areas of
interest include, but are not limited to the
following:\n\n\t\n\t\tTechnologies aimed at improving field applications
 for characterizing natural product sources\/species and their diverse
bioactive constituents, (examples &amp;ndash; DNA barcoding, gene chips,
 activity based profiling, biosensors, spectrometric equipment and
techniques, etc.)\n\t\n\t\tTechnologies aimed at the rapid
de-replication and removal of nuisance compounds in the crude extracts
of natural products, (examples &amp;ndash; innovative chromatographic
technologies, resins, catch and release-type systems,
etc.)\n\t\n\t\tTechnologies aimed at the development of highly sensitive
 phenotypic\/high content bioassays including capacity to identify
potential synergistic mechanisms, (examples - image-based cellular
assays, multiple-endpoint analysis based on phenotypic changes,
bioengineering chemically sensitive strains, etc.)\n\t\n\t\tTechnologies
 aimed at the creation and exploitation of model systems for the
expression of natural product constituents in high product yielding
hosts, (broad spectrum heterologous or homologous expression hosts,
stimulation of biosynthetic pathways, mutation, etc.)
and\n\t\n\t\tTechnologies aimed at predicting and\/or quantifying risks
of natural product&amp;ndash;drug interactions (examples &amp;ndash;
designed in vitro interaction assays or kits, in silico technologies,
etc.)\n\n\n\tApplications proposing any of the following research topics
 will be considered non-responsive and will not be
reviewed:\n\n\t\n\t\tApproaches applicable to only one organism,
biosynthetic pathway, and\/or natural product or are of limited
scope\n\t\n\t\tApproaches focused primarily on the production of analogs
 of natural products\n\t\n\t\tOptimization of large-scale production of
natural products\n\t\n\t\tChemical synthesis of natural
products\n\t\n\t\tCharacterization of biosynthetic enzymes of
established or easily predictable function\n\t\n\t\tApproaches focused

        "description": "\n\tPurpose\n\n\tThis funding opportunity
announcement (FOA) issued by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National
Institutes of Health (NIH) invites SBIR Phase I applications to design,
build, and test novel orthotics that capitalize on the plasticity of the
 neuromuscular and skeletal systems in growing children to reduce
musculoskeletal abnormalities and improve function in children with
disabilities.&amp;nbsp; Applicants are expected to use state-of-the-art
biomechanical modeling and materials to revolutionize the field of
orthotics for pediatric populations (birth through 21 years of
age).&amp;nbsp;\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tAbnormalities in
musculoskeletal development are common in children with disabilities,
such as cerebral palsy and spina bifida, and represent a significant and
 growing proportion of the burden of disability in the U.S. These
abnormalities include impaired muscle tone and decreased voluntary
muscle contraction, which can limit weight-bearing activities and
contribute to the development of contractures and distortions of
skeletal geometry, e.g. scoliosis.&amp;nbsp; Orthotics are the most
commonly prescribed medical device for children with a wide range of
developmental, orthopedic, and neurological conditions (i.e.,
plagiocephaly, scoliosis, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, club foot, Down
syndrome, muscular dystrophy, and others). They are used to correct bone
 alignment, reduce contracture\/spasticity, restrict or assist movement,
 and reduce pain. Unfortunately, as many as 50% of prescribed medical
devices are not used in this population because the child outgrows them,
 refuses to use them, or finds them unhelpful. This number may be partly
 reflective of the minimal innovation in the clinical orthotics field.
Orthotics prescribed today have changed little in the past forty years;
they are, in general, esthetically unpleasing, rigid plastic and metal
devices that restrict clothing and shoe choices. The clinical orthotics
field has seen little of the innovative research that has revolutionized
 the prosthetics field in recent years. However, advances in material
science, sensor technology, actuation, and rapid prototyping makes
reinvigorating the orthotics field a possibility today. In parallel with
 these hardware technology developments, the last twenty years has
brought advances in musculoskeletal modeling and computational power
which allows for subject-specific models with individual variation in
skeletal geometries to be created. This may be of particular importance
given that orthotics are largely used in conjunction with other
therapies, including botulinum toxin type A injections, physical and
occupational therapy, and surgical interventions. These models may be
used to inform the design of next generation orthotics to capitalize on
the plasticity of the developing nervous and musculoskeletal systems
while accounting for some of these other variables.\n\t\n\tThis FOA
addresses two themes from the NICHD Scientific Vision: ameliorating
childhood disabilities and the role of plasticity in both the nervous
and musculoskeletal systems in developing therapies. Moreover, the NIH
Blue Ribbon Panel on Medical Rehabilitation in their June 7, 2012
presentation to the National Advisory Child Health and Human Development
 Council highlighted musculoskeletal rehabilitation as an area where the
 National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research (NCMRR) at NICHD
should place a larger focus.\n\n\tScope\/Objectives\n\n\tNICHD invites
Phase I SBIR applications that incorporate appropriate input from
developmental pediatricians, physical and occupational therapists,
orthotists, materials scientists, and\/or engineers to use
state-of-the-art materials, manufacturing, and modeling techniques to
design, build, and test novel orthotics to promote improved
musculoskeletal development in children with disabilities. Innovations
may lie in the materials, design, fabrication, use or other aspects of
the orthoses; however the goal of these orthotics should be to improve
function in activities of daily living.\n\t\n\tAreas of interest include
 but are not limited to:\n\n\t\n\t\tOrthotics for lower limb, upper
limb, head, neck, or trunk.\n\t\n\t\tUse of smart textiles and
materials, in particular those with increased transparency, comfort,
adaptability, and flexibility.\n\t\n\t\tUse of advanced fabrication
technology, including rapid prototyping, 3-D printing,
etc.&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tOrthotics may treat existing structural or
functional abnormalities, or may act to prevent the occurrence of
secondary abnormalities. Designs should account for and promote healthy
growth of the child.\n\t\n\t\tDesigns may be passive or active, but
should be appropriate to the needs being addressed.\n\t\n\t\tModular or
component based designs, where appropriate, are
encouraged.\n\t\n\t\tSpecific diagnoses include but are not limited to:
plagiocephaly, scoliosis, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, club foot,
muscular dystrophy, and Down syndrome.\n\t\n\t\tSpecific impairments
include but are not limited to: bone deformation and alignment,
hypertonia (spasticity), hypotonia (weakness), paralysis, and
pain.\n\n\n\t\n\tWhile NICHD through NCMRR is committed to prosthetics
research and continues to accept applications under the omnibus SBIR
solicitation, applications for prosthetics are not applicable for this
FOA.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n",

        "description": "\n\tFor more than a decade, cognitive training
has been explored as an intervention in a variety of neuropsychiatric
disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, anxiety,
autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia, targeting specific
impairments in neural system functioning at different ages across the
lifespan.&amp;nbsp; These interventions have used various approaches,
including training of perceptual processes, drill-and-practice
techniques focused on learning via repetition and feedback, problem
solving and concept formation practice, and methods designed to enhance
compensatory cognitive processes.\n\n\tSeveral of these interventions
have been developed as computer-based programs with demonstrated
efficacy at improving neurobehavioral function, yet improvements in real
 world function have been less clear.&amp;nbsp; Overall there has been a
 significant lag in the full development and validation of
computer-based cognitive training for neuropsychiatric treatment, in
part due to the cross disciplinary expertise needed in developing
engaging, immersive computer programs that specifically target neural
systems implicated as treatment targets for neuropsychiatric
deficits.\n\n\tThe entertainment software industry has a demonstrated
capability in rapidly developing engaging, scalable, and commercially
successful products.&amp;nbsp; However, this industry has focused mostly
 on game development and not health interventions.&amp;nbsp; New
interest in developing computer game-based approaches to address health
has emerged in recent years, and may offer fresh opportunities to apply
highly engaging methods to the improvement of health functioning and
outcomes.\n\n\tGiven the promise of computer-based cognitive training
and the experience of the entertainment software industry at rapidly
developing engaging, scalable, and commercially successful products,
there is an opportunity for cross-disciplinary collaboration to further
develop promising computer-based interventions.&amp;nbsp; The NIMH has
developed this FOA to encourage partnerships between small businesses in
 the entertainment software sector and clinical neuropsychiatry
researchers with demonstrated track records in neuroplasticity and
cognitive training research, to further develop these
interventions.&amp;nbsp; Ultimately, if successful, these interventions
could be disseminated widely and quickly through
commercialization.\n\n\tThis NIMH SBIR FOA is informed by two recent
meetings: 1) the inaugural meeting of the Entertainment Software and
Cognitive Neurotherapeutics Society (ESCoNS) in September 2011, where
representatives from the entertainment software community,
neuroscientists, and the NIH came together to establish potential
partnerships for the development of cognitive neurotherapeutics; and 2)
the NIMH-sponsored meeting &amp;ldquo;Cognitive Training in Mental
Disorders: Advancing the Science&amp;rdquo; in April 2012, which focused
 on next steps in the further development, validation and implementation
 of cognitive training interventions, including a focus on novel and
multi-component interventions and new therapeutic targets.\n\n\tIt is
expected that products developed from this FOA will be drawn from
interventions with demonstrated efficacy and a strong scientific
rationale for the treatment target and intervention modality.&amp;nbsp;
Highest priority will be given to interventions that target functional
domains implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., attention,
working memory, social cognition, affect regulation, attention bias),
and the neurocircuitry underlying the targeted domain.&amp;nbsp; A
strong scientific justification for the choice of neuropsychiatric
disorder and age of research participants is also required.\n\n\tIt is
expected that the proposed partnerships would include groups with
demonstrated track records in the areas of neural plasticity and
cognitive training research, and the successful development and
commercialization of entertainment software programs.&amp;nbsp; Phase I
of this pilot program would serve as a vehicle for the primary research
and development, and will include initial feasibility testing.&amp;nbsp;
 It is expected that at the completion of Phase I the applicant will
have developed a working prototype.&amp;nbsp; In Phase II, it is
expected the applicant will formally evaluate the product utilizing an
appropriately powered efficacy study that includes validated cognitive
outcome measures and validated measures of functional outcome.&amp;nbsp;
 The applicant should also ensure the final product is in compliance
with FDA regulatory guidelines, by initiating the pre-IDE
process:&amp;nbsp;
http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/MedicalDevices\/DeviceRegulationandGuidance\/HowtoMarketYourDevice\/InvestigationalDeviceExemptionIDE\/ucm046164.htm#pre_ide.\n\n\tIn
 addition, the technology platform used in the application should be
flexible enough to allow future technology innovations to be
incorporated into it, to the extent possible, in order to remain
commercially viable.&amp;nbsp; The use of dynamic game balancing is also
 encouraged to provide an appropriate level of challenge to the
patient.&amp;nbsp; Following the completion of Phase II, it is expected
that the products under development will be commercialized and
disseminated.\n\n\tExamples of research and development activities that
would be appropriate topics for proposed Phase I\/Phase II projects,
include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\t\n\t\tRapidly
develop novel, engaging computer-based cognitive training programs that
are based on efficacious neurotherapeutic approaches and which use
cognitive training to target a specific neural system\/functional
domain.\n\t\n\t\tAugment existing computerized cognitive interventions
to be personalized, engaging, adaptive, sufficiently challenging, and
optimal for maximizing real world functional improvements.\n\t\n\t\tTest
 the feasibility, efficacy and potential adverse effects of these
programs utilizing measures of functional outcomes in an identified
clinical population, particularly those with neuropsychiatric disorders,
 ASD, and\/or HAND, at a specified developmental stage, including
measurement of the duration of treatment effects.
&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\tSmall businesses new to the NIMH SBIR program are
strongly encouraged to apply.&amp;nbsp; While those types of small
businesses will not be given special consideration during peer review,
NIMH will consider them at the time of award. Small businesses that
serve only to manage the project between entertainment software
companies and clinical researchers will not be considered appropriate
for this initiative and will be withdrawn as non-responsive.&amp;nbsp;
While managing the project between entertainment software programmers
and clinical researchers is a factor, small businesses should have the
scientific expertise and personnel to develop gaming technologies, a
scientific understanding of cognition, and the ability to work
cooperatively with clinical researchers on neuropsychiatric
disorders.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n",

approximately $28 to $39 billion from the United States to Mexico
through the 417 &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; border crossings between
the two countries. Estimates indicate that only 25% to 50% of that money
 is processed and laundered through financial institutions and

penalties for smuggling cash out of the United States; however, to many,
 smuggling cash is a victimless crime and the activity has continued to
increase. Existing methods such as stronger operational partnerships,
improved intelligence, random vehicle and body searches, and mandatory
transaction reporting have helped make some seizures, yet have done
little to stem the overall outflow. Department of Homeland Security
officials have testified that reducing bulk cash smuggling will disrupt
illicit activities and prevent proceeds from funding more crime, thereby
 reducing cross border violence. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection
(CBP) currently does not conduct full-time inspections of outbound
traffic, and with a lack of technology deployed at ports of entry, only a
 fraction of the illicit cash flow is seized. Accurate, fast,
non-intrusive methods for detecting smuggled currency at border

 Device Security",
        "description": "\n\tCommunication and commerce is shifting to
smart phones, tablets and other mobile devices. With this shift, it is
important to look at methods for improving the security of these devices
 and the applications that run on them. This is aided by having a firm
foundation from which to build security and trust. Highly trustworthy,
tamper evident components, called Roots of Trust (RoTs), that perform
vital security functions, can provide this. To support device integrity,
 isolation, and protected storage, devices should implement the
following RoTs:\n\t&amp;bull; Root of Trust for Storage (RTS) - provides
 a protected repository and a protected interface to store and manage
cryptographic keys and other critical security parameters.\n\t&amp;bull;
 Root of Trust for Verification (RTV) - provides a protected interface
and engine to verify digital signatures associated with
software\/firmware and create assertions based on the
result.\n\t&amp;bull; Root of Trust for Integrity (RTI) - provides
protected storage, integrity protection, and a protected interface to
store and manage assertions.\n\n\t\n\tOn laptop and desktop systems,
these roots of trust are often provided through a separate chip. This is
 a challenge on mobile devices where power and space are at a premium.
The objective of this SBIR topic is to use software to provide RoTs on
commercial mobile devices without the addition of specialized hardware.
The software may leverage existing hardware features that have been
incorporated into widely available commercial mobile devices. The goal
is to provide the security added by ROTs without increasing
manufacturing cost. The challenge is offering a level assurance similar
to solutions based on specialized hardware. The security functions
provided by the ROTs should be made available to the operating systems
and applications via an application programming interface. These
capabilities would be enhanced by a method for the management and
enforcement of policy on the device.&amp;nbsp;\n",

        "description": "\n\tAcross the United States on any given day
there are as many as 100,000 active missing person cases, resulting in
thousands of &amp;ldquo;lost person&amp;rdquo; searches each year. The
frequency of &amp;ldquo;lost person&amp;rdquo; searches conducted by
First Responders (Law Enforcement, Fire\/Rescue, Search and Rescue) is
increasing but changing from primarily lost children (including those
with autism) to people who are despondent, aged adults with various
forms of dementia, and people out for day hikes, among many other
types.\n\n\t\n\tThe types of actions taken in the first minutes and
hours of a search can make the difference as to whether these actions
result in successfully finding the person alive and well or not. While a
 lot of training has been developed and conducted for First Responders,
what is needed is additional research on the various categories of
&amp;ldquo;lost people,&amp;rdquo; (such as hikers, people with
dementia, children, hunters, among others), identifying the key
attributes derived from past experiences which can lead to them being
&amp;ldquo;found&amp;rdquo; quicker, and the development of easy to
follow instructions which can be used by the &amp;ldquo;first on
scene&amp;rdquo; resources to get started.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tTypically,
 the urban search involves either a lost child, or an elderly person
suffering from some form of dementia. It is often similar for the rural
and wilderness search. Much of the critical information must be gathered
 from the family and friends through the interview and investigative
process. This all takes time while the lost person may be traveling
farther away from the initial area. Time is the critical element in this
 process and an organized course of action for identifying the critical
information and then obtaining it is
necessary.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tSearch and Rescue theory and the suggested
 deployment of tactical resources are based upon the Probability of
Success Rate (PSR). The major components of determining the PSR is the
speed of Search and Rescue (SAR) resources, the Probability of Detection
 (POD), and the Probability of Area (POA). First responders responding
to lost persons incidents are required to file reports but quick access
to these reports are rarely possible during real time incident response.
 Determining the POD in the land environment has also been problematic.
Products or procedures that can capitalize on existing GIS information
such as Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) data to provide a predictive
 sweep width value (a component of determining POD) may prove valuable. A
 database of environmental and terrain conditions that might predict the
 sweep width value is another approach. Although many databases exist,
there is no tool that is able to quickly search and analyze the stored
information to arrive at the best possible approach to finding the lost
person.&amp;nbsp;\n",

firefighters who lost their lives in the September 11, 2001 World Trade
Center collapse to the firefighters and other first responders, and
civilians who are killed or injured performing their regular duties from
 collapsing structures, including incidents involving single family
dwellings.\n\n\t\n\tThere is a need for accurate and easily deployable
technology to predict structural collapse to avoid or reduce these
incidents. The development of a small vibration sensing technology
including development of hardware with wireless solid-state electronic
sensors and base display units, as well as the interpretation algorithm
necessary to translate the vibration data from the sensor into a
&amp;ldquo;green\/yellow\/red&amp;rdquo; tactical decision aid to alert
incident commanders of a pending collapse is a high priority
technology.\n\n\t\n\tThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the United States Fire
Administration (USFA), and the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) have been investigating the use of new measurement
technologies in the fire environment for the prediction of structural
collapse. This includes the use of thermal imaging technology to measure
 temperature, lasers to measure building displacement, and vibration
sensors to measure changes in the frequency of the building structure
during the fire. Full-scale fire experiments have been conducted on a
number of structures, including &amp;ldquo;traditional wood

construction. The results of these experiments indicate that the
vibration-sensing technique has the best potential for reliable
prediction of structural collapse. As a result, this project is focused

reliably detect and locate, in all weather conditions that a sniper
would operate in, a sniper amongst the clutter of an urban environment
before they fire their weapon. Although law enforcement can establish
security perimeters and control items entering the space, they are also
concerned about threats from outside the security perimeters. These
threats include snipers outside the security perimeter.
&amp;ldquo;Pre-shot&amp;rdquo; allows for security force response to
dissuade\/prevent an adversary from getting the shot off in the first
place.\n\n\t\n\tThere are several factors challenging today&amp;rsquo;s
detection technologies that need to be addressed, including the
following three challenges. First, law enforcement needs the ability to
locate a sniper amongst objects and people surrounding them at all times
 of the day, and in all weather conditions. Objects commonly found in an
 urban environment such as traffic lights, signage, vehicles and
building features can be distracting to the detection system and create
clutter. People carry objects and devices that create clutter. Second, a
 sniper must be detected from a different location than the protection
area. Detectors need to cover a wide area. Finally, the technology must
be portable. The need to detect snipers moves from one location to
another. Law enforcement needs to set up the technology and make it
operational within hours of events and activities, and then the
technology needs to be dismantled and moved somewhere else for another
event.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe proposed solution must be able to detect
and locate amidst the noise of an urban environment and in all weather
conditions sniper behavior, actions, or weapons before a weapon is
fired. The proposed solution must be able to detect and locate a weapon
trained on a target from outside the weapon&amp;rsquo;s line-of-fire

Stimulation",
        "description": "\n\t1. Research Objectives\n\t\n\tThe clinical
utility of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of the
debilitating symptoms of motor disorders, including
Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease and essential tremor has been established.
 In addition, DBS may offer relief of symptoms in other disorders such
as Dystonia, Tourette&amp;rsquo;s Syndrome and Epilepsy.&amp;nbsp; DBS
is considered a treatment option for patients whose symptoms cannot be
adequately controlled with medications. \n\n\tDBS relies on a surgically
 implanted, battery-operated stimulator to deliver electrical pulses via
 an implanted multi-contact electrode to targeted areas in the brain
that are involved with the control of movement or cognitive function.
While the exact mechanism by which high frequency electrical stimulation
 provided by DBS alters neural circuitry to reduce the burden of disease
 is unclear, it is evident that for the majority of patients who undergo
 the procedure, substantial improvements in symptom severity
result.\n\n\tIn spite of its clinical success, DBS technology and the
associated surgical procedure have several limitations. For example,
clinicians lack tools that combine anatomical, physiological,
electrical, and behavioral data to optimize electrode placement and
stimulator programming. Patients endure significant discomfort during
implantation due to the use of rigidly fixed stereotactic frames. In
addition, the DBS technology itself is relatively simplistic. The pulse
stimulator operates in an always on, open-loop mode regardless of the
severity of patient symptoms and the electrode itself consists of a
cylindrical shaft of only a few contacts thus limiting the selectivity
of the electrical stimulation. While enhancing some types of motor
function, DBS has been less successful in improving other functions,
particularly speech. When improvements in speech outcomes after DBS were
 noted, they were typically minimal and more variable than seen in
akinesia, rigidity and dyskinesias. Therefore, there are excellent
opportunities for innovation towards improved DBS technology and
procedures.\n\n\tThis initiative is intended to stimulate the
development of: 1) tools that will facilitate the DBS surgical process,
programming, and outcome assessments, and 2) technological innovation in
 the design of electrode and pulse stimulators. The tools and technology
 produced by this program will permit enhanced targeting and delivery of
 therapeutic stimulation in the brain, ultimately improving the quality
of life for DBS patients. Useful tools and technology that would be

        "description": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the
autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreatic
islets of Langerhans and affects more than one million Americans,
usually with onset in childhood or young adulthood. The disease markedly
 impairs quality of life and shortens lifespan primarily through
premature mortality.  T1D is associated with numerous complications
including blindness, renal failure, painful nerve disorders, and
amputation.  In addition to its devastating toll in human suffering, T1D
 and its complications result in significant health care expenditures
for families and constitute a major societal economic
burden.\n\nClinical Trials have demonstrated significant reductions in
complications of T1D through intensive control of blood glucose levels.
However, despite the availability of increasingly effective treatment
modalities, including insulin analogues, continuous glucose monitors
(CGMs) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) devices, a
substantial proportion of patients with T1D cannot achieve optimal
glycemic control despite enormous efforts. Compounding this difficulty
is the trade-off between improved glycemic control and an increased risk
 for potentially life-threatening hypoglycemia. \n\nA viable option for
the treatment of diabetes is a system (artificial pancreas or
closed-loop) that can mimic normal pancreatic beta cell function thereby
 restoring normal metabolic homeostasis without causing hypoglycemia.
However, there are important technological obstacles such as
glucose-sensing inaccuracies, imperfect algorithms for calculating the
appropriate dose of insulin\/glucagon taking into consideration diet and
 physical activity, insulin pumps\u2019 mechanical problems, time delay
from subcutaneous insulin infusion to pharmacologic effect and
biocompatibility issues that need to be resolved through the development
 of new technologies that may lead to a new generation of
integrated\/automated devices. The ultimate research goal would be the
development of mechanical or bio-artificial systems that may improve
metabolic control and decrease glycemic excursions robustly preventing
hypoglycemic episodes. \n\nThis FOA is intended to support cutting edge
research conducted by small business leading to the development of
innovative technologies that may advance progress toward an integrated,
long term, automated, wearable; glucose regulated insulin\/pancreatic
hormone delivery closed loop system.  This announcement has two main
purposes: a) promote technical innovation and b) promote pre-clinical or
 clinical testing of single or combined components of a closed loop
system. Examples of projects that this announcement intends to solicit
include but are not limited to:\n\n1. Glucose sensors and Insulin
delivery systems:\n\nDevelopment of novel and more accurate
non-enzymatic based glucose detection technologies. \nDevelopment of new
 miniaturized, implantable or minimally invasive continuous glucose
sensors with long functional life (at least 3-4 weeks), real time
measurement, with minimal need of recalibration, easily implanted and
replaced, unobtrusive to the user and accurate at low glycemic levels.
 \nDevelopment of redundant continuous glucose monitoring technologies
that consist of two or more sensing mechanisms and may provide
sufficient data to allow automated insulin delivery to target euglycemia
 with minimal risk for overdose \nApplication of nanotechnology advances
 to the design of new glucose sensing and insulin delivery devices.
\nDevelopment of miniaturized multisensor platforms able to detect
glucose and other metabolically relevant analytes. For instance,
integration of insulin sensors to a closed loop platform. \nDevelopment
of novel biocompatible smart biomaterials to be used for the
manufacturing of implantable devices. \nDevelopment of implantable
biohybrids matrices\/membranes that may release bioactive agents which
either promote vascularization and\/or inhibit the
inflammatory\/fibrotic response allowing higher biocompatibility and
longer durability of devices. \nDevelopment of injectable\/implantable
glucose regulated insulin\/glucagon delivery systems\/depots able to
function in a homeostatic fashion lasting days\/weeks. \nDevelopment of
highly concentrated and stable insulin formulations that are more
rapidly absorbed for closed loop insulin delivery. \nNovel and more
stable glucagon formulations that could be used in a closed loop system.
 \nNew, more advanced insulin\/glucagon delivery devices\/pumps,
external or implantable able to be integrated in a closed loop system.
For instance:  Dual chamber pumps for multi hormonal therapies.
\nSmarter pump technologies - pumps that directly or indirectly monitor
and track insulin delivered for use with Algorithms.  \n2. Algorithms
and Integrated Systems:\n\nDevelopment of reliable and integrated
algorithms that translate accurate glucose measurements into changes in
the delivery of pancreatic hormones in order to maintain glucose
excursions within the physiological range and that are able to
detect\/correct failure of the closed loop system components.
\nDevelopment of more effective, reliable and integrated wireless
systems. \nDevelopment of smaller and portable controllers.
\nTechnologies that improve or facilitate information visualization and
integration of data for analysis. \nDevelopment of a hypoglycemia alert
system able to reliably detect\/predict glucose levels &lt; 70 mg\/dL,
alert the individual or caregiver of impending hypoglycemia, shut
insulin delivery off when necessary and effectively track events
reporting into a centralized system. \nClosed loop systems using
algorithms that may incorporate delivery of counter-regulatory hormones
in order to prevent or correct hypoglycemia effectively. \nDevelopment
of new devices able to integrate the sensing, controller and delivery
components in one unit. \nDevelopment and\/or optimization of
bioartificial pancreas\/islet replacement devices and its components.
\n3. Pre-Clinical and Clinical Topics:\n\nDevelopment and testing of new
 technologies for visually and\/or cognitively impaired patients with
diabetes \nIn-silico simulation models that may facilitate the design of
 proper clinical studies to test new devices. \nPre-clinical testing of
components of a closed loop system. \nClinical testing of components of a
 closed loop system. \nDevelop telemedicine approaches that can be
incorporated as components\/and or adjuvants of an artificial pancreas
for better diabetes self management. Example: Integrated cell phone
controller that would allow for remote system monitoring. \n",

        "topic_name": "Low Ground Clearance Vehicle Detection and
Warning System",
        "description": "High profile highway-rail grade crossings
present a severe risk to low ground clearance vehicles such as low-boys,
 car-carriers, low-floor urban transit buses, and farm equipment
trailers in the United States.  When such a vehicle traverses a
high-profile roadway section, such as a high-profile grade crossing, the
 vehicle may become stuck on the hump of the crossing and then be struck
 by a train. One such incident involved a tractor trailer that became
stuck at a grade crossing in Glendale, CA on January 28, 2000 and was
subsequently struck by a Metrolink commuter train.  This problem could
be more complicated considering that fact that the underbody of a
commercial vehicle is not always a flat surface. There could be electric
 cables, air lines, tanks, storage cabinets, etc. suspended from the
flat surface of the underbody of a commercial vehicle.  It is aimed to
have a detecting approach that will be able to take these suspended or
protruded accessories into account and sense whether these suspended or
protruded vehicle parts or accessories are rigid, semi-rigid, or
flexible.  Would they be rigid enough to get the commercial vehicle
stuck on the high-profile grade crossing?  \n\nOne of the ways to reduce
 the risk to low ground clearance vehicles is to provide advance warning
 regarding the existence of high-profile crossings ahead.  Passive
signage already exists for this application (w10-5).  However, research
is needed into the development of a reliable active system, such as the
ones used to detect over-height vehicles before tunnels, that would
detect a low ground clearance vehicle on approach to a high-profile
crossing and trigger a wayside active warning message that would be
visible to the motorist.  The system envisioned would be capable of
generating its own power, be durable enough for long-term operation with
 minimal maintenance, and able to operate in adverse conditions
including heavy snow.  Ultimately it would achieve at least the same
level of reliability and quality assurance as existing over-height
vehicle detection systems. Recommendation should also be made as how far
 the developed detection system should be placed away from the grade
crossing to allow low-ground clearance vehicle sufficient space to stop
ahead of the crossing.  The allowable stopping distance, of course,
depends on the speed limit for the roadway plus some safety factor.  The
 ideal placement should allow a low-ground clearance vehicle to take an
alternative route or detour before reaching the high-profile grade
crossing. \n\nSome engineering research and analysis are also necessary
to recommend an accurate and scientific-based approach for calculating
the actual clearance threshold that should consider the specific nature
of each individual high-profile grade crossing and the dynamic behavior
of the vehicle at the crossing. \n\nExpected Phase I Outcomes:\nOutcomes
 expected from the Phase I include a detailed concept that demonstrates
the viability of creating a prototype that satisfies the attributes
described above.  It should also estimate the cost of the proposed
technology (with and without installation) per grade crossing.  Offer
should indicate to what degree the offeror has successfully
commercialized products of past projects.\n\nExpected Phase II
Outcomes:\nPhase II efforts include manufacturing and demonstrating a
working prototype low ground clearance vehicle detection system that
demonstrates potential for achieving reliability and quality assurance
metrics equivalent to or greater than existing over-height vehicle
detection systems. \n",

Applications",
        "description": "\n\tVideo and Image recording systems are
increasingly being used by NMFS for a multitude of applications.
&amp;nbsp;Underwater systems are deployed on or near the seafloor or
towed above the seafloor to record images of fish that are later
analyzed to estimate numbers, sizes, and species composition of fish in
an area. &amp;nbsp;Underwater systems are also installed in trawls to
collect images that can be used to determine numbers, sizes, and species
 of fish caught in the trawl with the end goal of developing
non-destructive trawls that collect all necessary information without
actually catching the fish. &amp;nbsp;Other systems are installed on
commercial fishing vessels to monitor what fish are caught, kept, and
discarded during fishing operations. &amp;nbsp;The effort required to
analyze data from these systems is time consuming and
expensive.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Computer automated analysis to identify
fish species contained in an image sequence or video segment has been
moderately successful in very controlled photographic conditions when
the potential number of species in the images is limited to just a few.
&amp;nbsp;Fish lengths are successfully measured using stereo camera
systems but require significant manual input by an analyst.
&amp;nbsp;There is a need for innovative approaches to automated
recognition and counting of fish species and estimation of length of
fish in the images collected by these
systems.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProject Goals:&amp;nbsp; The long term
goal is to automate analysis of video and\/or image sequences for two
focal areas [(1) live fish underwater and (2) captured fish on vessels]
to reduce the labor required to produce numerical data from the video or
 image sequences. &amp;nbsp;Each focal area presents a number of
technical challenges. &amp;nbsp;Underwater images are frequently
required to make use of ambient light to avoid influencing fish behavior
 and the resulting images are usually low contrast. &amp;nbsp;Fish in
these images may be viewed from any aspect and distance from the camera.
 &amp;nbsp;Accurate counting of these fish requires tracking each
individual during the time it is in the camera view to avoid counting
one fish multiple times. &amp;nbsp;In contrast, captured fish could be
imaged using artificial light at a fixed range but may (on a conveyor
belt, for example) be positioned in any orientation in close proximity
to, or partially obscured by, other fish. &amp;nbsp;Some fish species
exhibit multiple color phases underwater and most fish change color and
appearance with time after capture. &amp;nbsp;Successful projects will
produce either software or hardware\/software systems, applicable to one
 or more of these scenarios, that accept or collect sequences of images
and count the number and sizes of each fish species present in the
images.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables: &amp;nbsp;This section should list the specific activities
 that will be carried out during the Phase I award. &amp;nbsp;It should
also list the expected deliverables that must be met to address the
project goals.&amp;nbsp; Phase I is the feasibility
study.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Activities and deliverables should be written
 in bullet form. \n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tFor focal areas 1 (live fish
underwater) and\/or 2 (captured fish on
vessels):\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\tIdentify potentially quantifiable
features of commercially important and frequently encountered fish
species occurring in the southeast US Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and
 Gulf of Mexico that can be used for automated classification such as
shape and color patterns.\n\t\n\t\tDevelop and demonstrate capability to
 automate data collection, potentially including but not necessarily
limited to:\n\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Identification of images or
segments of video when fish are present\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Species classification\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Species-specific
metrics of abundance and individual sizes\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Habitat characteristics\n\n\t\n\t\tQuantify error associated with data
generated (e.g., proportion of fish correctly identified to species;
degree of error about abundance or size estimates).&amp;nbsp;
Demonstrate level of repeatability of results across multiple
users\n\t\n\t\tDeliverable: a detailed report documenting methods and
results, with discussion of results and identification of successes and
remaining challenges\n\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase II Activities and
Expected Deliverables: &amp;nbsp;(Same format as for Phase I.)&amp;nbsp;
 Phase II is the prototype development stage and where the majority of
the R&amp;amp;D takes place.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tFor focal areas 1
(live fish underwater) and\/or 2 (captured fish on
vessels):\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Develop one or more transferable software packages \/ platforms with
user-friendly interface to accomplish data processing capabilities
developed during Phase I
activities\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Products should allow improvement in species classification performance
 through incorporation of new training data and information on
additional
species.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Products should allow analyst intervention\/correction in instances
where confidence in species identification is
low.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Desired analysis results include:\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Individual

Competitiveness of U.S. Marine Aquaculture",
        "description": "\n\tThe purpose of this subtopic is to develop
innovative products and services to support thedevelopment of an
environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable
marineaquaculture industry in the U.S.in a way that is compatible with
healthy marineecosystems and other users of coastal and ocean
resources.As marine aquaculture technology moves from research to
operations, aquacultureproducers need affordable and reliable
techniques, products,and services to support growth andeconomic
viability of sustainable aquaculture operations. There is also a need
forreliable and affordable equipment, instruments, tools and techniques
to assess the potential risks and benefits of marine aquaculture
facilities and to monitorany impacts of marine aquaculture operations on
 marine ecosystems.\n\n\tNOAA&amp;rsquo;s mission includes enabling
sustainable marine aquaculture to maximize economic and social benefits
and provide safe seafood.&amp;nbsp;Enabling the development of
sustainable marine aquaculture figures prominently in NOAA&amp;rsquo;s
Next Generation Strategic Plan and in NOAA&amp;rsquo;s recent new Policy
 for Marine Aquaculture (currently in draft form and awaiting final
release after public comment). The three areas of focus for SBIR grants
in aquaculture this year closely align with these guiding principles.
They are:\n\n\t1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Alternative
feeds\n\n\t2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Improved health
management\n\n\t3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Novel production
technologies and
techniques\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Alternative feeds\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tSummary:&amp;nbsp; Currently
available aquafeeds are highly dependent on fish meal and fish
oils.&amp;nbsp; These cost of fish meal and fish oil has increased
dramatically in recent years, reducing profit margins in finfish
aquaculture operations. &amp;nbsp;In addition, some question whether the
 forage fish from which fish oil and meal are derived can continue to be
 sustainably managed as demand for aquafeeds continues to increase.
&amp;nbsp;New diets and ingredients are needed which successfully
replace these marine components with non-traditional sources of protein
and oils that result in sustainable and economical feeds.
&amp;nbsp;There is a need to meet the nutritional requirements of marine
 species in all life stages (from hatchery to market size), including
use of diets that rely less on fish oil and fish meal without
sacrificing the human health benefits of seafood
consumption.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProject Goals:&amp;nbsp; Develop
aquafeeds that successfully replace fish meal and fish oils with novel
ingredients from sustainable sources, including&amp;nbsp; biological or
chemical methods for de novo production of&amp;nbsp; long chain n-3
fatty acids and\/or high value nutritional products from marine algae.
&amp;nbsp;Reduce the &amp;ldquo;fish in, fish out&amp;rdquo; ratio for
cultured species.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables: &amp;nbsp;Research and development geared towards the
development of sustainable replacements for fish meal and fish oils in
aquafeeds, or the development means to produce fish meal and oil from
seafood byproducts (e.g. fish
trimmings).\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tDeliverables include reports from
trials of the proposed diets showing biological and economic feasibility
 of the new feeds.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase II Activities and Expected
 Deliverables:&amp;nbsp; Prototype pilot-scale trials of the products
developed in phase I showing biological and economic feasibility of the
feeds under commercial
conditions.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Improved health management\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tSummary:&amp;nbsp;
Disease is one of the main causes of losses in aquaculture operations.
Transmission of disease from wild to farmed animals and vice versa is
also a concern in aquaculture operations. &amp;nbsp;Better therapeutants
 and techniques are needed to prevent, diagnose, and manage diseases in
aquaculture operations.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProject Goals:&amp;nbsp;
Develop improved products and tools for preventing, diagnosing, and
controlling disease in marine aquaculture
operations.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables:&amp;nbsp; Execute research and development of preventive
measures, vaccines, diagnostic tools, and other management techniques
for marine aquatic diseases that impact aquaculture operations.
&amp;nbsp;Report to show promise for commercial application of such
techniques.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase II Activities and Expected
Deliverables:&amp;nbsp; Prototype trials of the techniques and products
developed in phase I showing biological and economic feasibility under
commercial
conditions.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Novel production technologies and
techniques\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tSummary:&amp;nbsp; As U.S. aquaculture
develops to fill the gap between domestic demand and supply, new
technologies and techniques are needed to help the industry develop in a
 sustainable way. &amp;nbsp;Sustainable production and management
technologies and techniques complement the improved feeds and health
management focus areas.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProject Goals:&amp;nbsp;
Development of improved aquaculture technologies and techniques and
management measures for raising marine organisms to market size in
land-based, coastal, and in open-ocean grow-out facilities with careful
monitoring, minimizing, and mitigating of environmental impacts.
&amp;nbsp;Examples of projects considered under this focus area include
projects to develop technologies and techniques related to:&amp;nbsp;
production of fish, shellfish, and marine algae in hatcheries;
evaluation and selection of appropriate sites for marine aquaculture
operations and prevent or reduce effluents and escapes from facilities;
and engineering technologies (e.g. cage designs, moorings, cleaning and
feeding systems).\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables: &amp;nbsp;Research and develop improved aquaculture
techniques and management measures for raising marine organisms in a
sustainable way. Report to show promise for commercial application of
such techniques.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase II Activities and Expected
Deliverables:&amp;nbsp; Prototype trials of the techniques and products
developed in phase I showing biological and economic feasibility under
commercial conditions.\n",

to site such projects in an environmentally sound way, and to assess the
 environmental impacts of such emplacements in a logical, efficient

development of innovative observing technologies that support siting
decisions and\/or evaluation of environmental impacts of renewable ocean
 energy technologies such as a) biofuels developed from microalgae or
macroalgae, b) wave, c) tidal\/current, d) geothermal, e)
offshore\/coastal wind, or f) ocean-thermal energy

        "description": "\n\tThe National Geodetic Survey (NGS) within
NOS has a federal mandate to provide accurate positioning, including
heights, to all federal non-military mapping activities in the USA.
&amp;nbsp;The NOAA NGS leads the GRAV-D Project (Gravity for the
Redefinition of the American Vertical Datum) with a specific goal to
model and monitor Earth&amp;#39;s geoid (a surface of the gravity field,
 very closely related to global mean sea level) to serve as a zero
reference surface for all heights in the nation.&amp;nbsp; Accurate
heights are critical information needed for better understanding of
threats to low-lying communities and coastal ecosystems from inundation
by storms, flooding, and\/or sea level rise.&amp;nbsp; The GRAV-D
Project has successfully utilized airborne gravimetry observations to
collect highly precise gravity measurements throughout CONUS, Alaska,
and their littoral regions. &amp;nbsp;However, more than 85% of the
targeted surface area still needs to be economically surveyed, including
 portions of Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, Hawaii, the U.S. Pacific
Island holdings, and most of interior
CONUS.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProject Goals:&amp;nbsp;As Unmanned Aircraft
 Systems (UAS) mature in flight capabilities and operational readiness,
UAS provide a feasible alternative to manned airborne gravimetry
missions. &amp;nbsp;Gravity data collection by manned aircraft can
typically be categorized as very dull due to long, repetitive flight
paths as the aircraft &amp;quot;mows the lawn&amp;quot; over a given
data collection region. &amp;nbsp;These missions pose a safety challenge
 for pilots who must maintain concentration and focus during the mundane
 flight patterns. &amp;nbsp;UAS can also offer fuel savings over
comparable manned aircraft, leading to more energy efficient data
collection, and quicker survey completion because of the long endurance
of the platform.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe NOAA UAS Program is partnering
 with the GRAV-D Project to explore cost and operationally feasible UAS
observing strategies for gravity data collection. &amp;nbsp;We request a
 Phase I study to demonstrate the design feasibility of an airborne
gravimeter suitable for autonomous data collection onboard a low or
medium altitude long endurance UAS operating in turbulent environments.
&amp;nbsp;The design of the system must describe the detailed system
interface between the UAS and gravimeter payload, including power,
navigation, and data communication systems.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I
 Activities and Expected Deliverables:&amp;nbsp;The purpose of this
Phase I is to determine the technical feasibility of the proposed
research and the quality of performance of the small business concern
receiving an award. &amp;nbsp;We request a Phase I study to demonstrate
the design feasibility of an airborne gravimeter suitable for autonomous
 data collection onboard a low or medium altitude long endurance UAS
operating in turbulent environments. &amp;nbsp;The design of the system
must:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Identify a

$10 trillion of cargo and 95 percent of our international trade (by
weight) annually.&amp;nbsp; In an intricate dance, mariners use nautical
 charts with decades-old depth measurements, annual tidal data
interpolated from distant stations, and rules-of-thumb to estimate the
amount of safe water when navigating supertankers and mega-container
ships.&amp;nbsp; Often ships have only inches of clearance from the
seabed.&amp;nbsp; The uncertainties of this process put the safety of
navigation and of our environment at risk from groundings and
collisions.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tA growing and credible body of
scientific research has established that it is possible to measure water
 depths in real time using X-band radars.&amp;nbsp; This research
validates that the dispersion relation from fluid mechanics directly
relates wave speed to water depth in the marine environment.&amp;nbsp;
Further research establishes that wave speeds can be measured using
inexpensive and common marine X-band radar.&amp;nbsp; Innovation is now
needed to apply and couple these 2 results to measure water depths in
real time with a precision, accuracy, and resolution suitable for
navigation use.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tBathymetric radar would
revolutionize hydrographic surveying and marine navigation, ensuring
that critical navigation lanes are monitored continuously rather than at
 discrete intervals.&amp;nbsp; It could eliminate groundings and delays
caused by today&amp;rsquo;s uncertain bathymetry.&amp;nbsp; Further, it
could permit NOAA to get more for the $100M it spends annually on
surveying and charting and contribute to reducing our surveying backlog
including the massive new requirements in the
Arctic.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProject Goals:&amp;nbsp; \n\n\tThe short

are:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Develop algorithms that can receive and process signals from commercial
 X-band radars and produce a continuous stream of accurate water depth
measurements, over a large area, in real
time;\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Measure the precision, accuracy, and resolution in both location and

limitations to their use and their adequacy for navigation purposes;
and\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Determine the maximum and minimum depths to which the technique can

are:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Produce robust versions of the algorithms, reduced to software that can

        "description": "\n\tSmall and medium-sized towns and cities need
 access to actionable information on local climate change impacts to
better understand and visualize climate impacts on their jurisdictions,
enhance their ability to visualize and show climate-related risks and
impacts to their constituents and their governing bodies, send and
receive real-time communications to and from their constituents in a
timely manner, and use all the gathered information to improve planning
and decision-making.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tLarge cities such as New York
City and Chicago have staff devoted to studying and communicating
climate impacts in their jurisdictions.&amp;nbsp; These cities have
climate adaptation plans and have projects aimed at adapting
infrastructure and social systems to a changing climate.&amp;nbsp;
Smaller jurisdictions lack the resources and the expertise for similar
activities, yet they face similar risks and
challenges.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tFunding will be used to develop new and
 innovative climate visualization tools and\/or toolboxes containing
virtual tools in response to these jurisdictional needs.&amp;nbsp; These
 tools will improve jurisdictions&amp;rsquo; ability to understand, plan
 for and adapt to climate variability and change and will also ensure
that they have an ability to communicate data and information in a
timely manner, even during natural disasters when conventional means of
communications become unavailable due to gridlock or system
overload.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThere are a variety of freely available
climate impact visualization tools available (e.g.,
www.csc.noaa.gov\/digitalcoast, www.droughtmonitor.unl.edu,
http:\/\/radar.srh.noaa.gov\/fire).&amp;nbsp; However there is a need to
 better integrate these existing data visualization tools with the
mapping and planning tools that local planners currently use, in order
to make climate information useful for actionable local
decision-making.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProject Goals: &amp;nbsp;In the
last decade, there has been an increased awareness and understanding of
global, regional, and local-scale impacts of climate variability and
change.&amp;nbsp; The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
and the U.S. government, through national climate assessments, have
alerted the public that we will continue to see changes in our climate
through more intense precipitation and temperature-related weather and
climate events as well as longer droughts and more devastating
floods.&amp;nbsp; Those living in coastal areas are also more aware of
the potential for a rising sea and many have personally witnessed
increased storm surges.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tIncreasingly, local
municipal authorities realize that they need to make plans to cope with
and adapt to these changes, and a number of organizations and federal
agencies have begun to provide tools and services to support this
planning.&amp;nbsp; For example, the National Integrated Drought
Information System (NIDIS) is studying how to best provide information
on drought; and the NOAA Coastal Services Center has a number of tools
for coastal planners on their website (e.g.,
www.csc.noaa.gov\/digitalcoast, www.droughtmonitor.unl.edu,
http:\/\/radar.srh.noaa.gov\/fire).\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tHowever, these
planning tools and services are not always integrated effectively or
used optimally because local planners may not: (a) be aware the tools
exist, (b) know what information they need, and where or how to access
it, (c) have information at a usable spatial or temporal scale, and\/or
(d) have skills needed to use or manipulate the
tools.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe goal of this project is to develop new
and innovative climate visualization tools and\/or toolboxes that help
local urban planners understand and plan for ongoing and future climate
impacts.&amp;nbsp; Included in the scope of this project is a guaranteed
 ability for local government official and decision makers to send and
receive communications to and from their constituents in a very timely
manner (within seconds) during weather- and climate-related disasters
and extreme events.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected

density, morphology and liquid water content. &amp;nbsp;Polarized
microwave observations can provide this important

Technology",
        "description": "\n\tLightning observations have many
meteorological applications, which are continuously expanding as
lightning detection technology improves.&amp;nbsp; Lightning detection
networks monitor the low (LF), very-low (VLF), and very-high (VHF)
frequency radiation emitted by lightning flashes.&amp;nbsp; Since
cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes emit most strongly in the LF and VLF range,
 LF\/VLF networks can detect a fraction of CG flashes globally with as
few as 50 sensors.&amp;nbsp; However, intra-cloud (IC) lightning is more
 closely related to updraft intensity than CG lightning, making it more
beneficial for diagnosing severe convection.&amp;nbsp; IC flashes emit
most strongly in the VHF range, which propagates along a line of site
and attenuates quickly, requiring a dense network of sensors to provide
3-D lightning observations within relatively small geographical
regions.&amp;nbsp; Although Lightning Mapping Array (LMA; Rison et al.
1999) networks currently provide valuable information, their fixed
locations limit the number and variety of storm environments that can be
 sampled.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, this proposal seeks to develop VHF
lightning mapping technology that can be transported to remote regions
(e.g., deep oceans and field campaign locations), deployed quickly, and
operated remotely.&amp;nbsp; This new tool must leverage existing
lightning detection technologies and recent field campaigns that have
proven the value of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) for observing
thunderstorms.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProject Goals:
&amp;nbsp;It is expected that this technology will be used to better
diagnose and predict extreme weather during future field campaigns and
significant weather events, and also for validation of future
space-borne lightning detection technologies (e.g., GOES-R Geostationary
 Lightning Mapper; GLM).&amp;nbsp; Several LMA networks are currently
being deployed, which demonstrates the value of these 3-D lightning
observations.&amp;nbsp; Recent field campaigns also have expended
considerable effort to deploy LMA networks to Sao Paulo, Brazil and
Northern Colorado.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The proposed tool would reduce
the amount of effort required to deploy LMA networks for future field
campaigns, and will lessen the need to deploy static LMA networks when
they are only needed for significant events (e.g., rocket launches from
government or private facilities).&amp;nbsp; VHF lightning observations
from an aerial platform will reduce contamination from RF sources on the
 ground, and provide IC detection capabilities over a larger
geographical area than present ground-based LMA networks.&amp;nbsp; The
new technology also should include video observations to help understand
 how the amount of light leaving the cloud is related to both the
intensity of lightning and amount\/type of precipitation inside a
cloud.&amp;nbsp; Outside of the present LMA domains (e.g., over the
oceans), no technology currently exists to evaluate the quality of
space-borne IC lightning observations relative to ground-based
measurements.&amp;nbsp; Thus, this new technology will provide a
valuable tool for validating the lightning observations provided by the
GLM outside of the present LMA domains.&amp;nbsp; Once proven, the
overall approach could be expanded upon to include different sensors and
 scientific objectives.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I Activities and
Expected Deliverables: \n\n\t\n\t\tIdentify VHF lightning detection
technologies that are suitable for use aboard a small
UAS\n\t\n\t\tExamine potential aerial platforms that can house this
sensor suite (e.g., VHF, GPS, video)\n\t\n\t\tDetermine the best option
for flying multiple UASs in tandem\n\t\n\t\tIdentify methods for
communication between individual sensors and a central
hub\n\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase II Activities and Expected
Deliverables: \n\n\t\n\t\tIncorporate lightning detection equipment into
 an UAS\n\t\n\t\tDevelop navigation and communication
systems\n\t\n\t\tDeploy a prototype network\n\t\n\t\tValidate the new

all major space weather storms are associated with major solar

 and the U.S. EPA\u2019s ToxCast program
(http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/ncct\/toxcast\/), were developed to expand the
scope and throughput of screening compounds for toxicity. A primary
focus of these programs is on the use of in vitro methods and assays
using lower organisms to screen thousands of chemicals for toxicity in
order to identify mechanisms of compound-induced biological activity,
characterize toxicity pathways, facilitate cross-species extrapolation,
and provide input to models for low-dose extrapolation.  Data generated
by these methods will be used to prioritize compounds for more extensive
 toxicological evaluation and to develop predictive models for
biological response in humans. Current approaches are limited in terms
of incorporating genetic variability in toxicity testing and in
assessing the effects of chemicals in multiple normal tissue and cell
types, relying on immortalized cell lines or primary cell lines derived
from tissues. Thus, there is a need for novel, medium- to
high-throughput assays (at least a 96-well format) to evaluate the
effects of chemical compounds on the differentiation of pluripotent or
multi-potent stem cells as well as the effects of chemical exposures on
differentiated cell types representative of various in vivo tissues.
Approaches can include the use of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS)
cells, approved human embryonic stem (ES) cell lines, or ES or iPS cells
 derived from genetically characterized mouse strains. Assays should be
able to measure the effects of toxicants on the differentiation process
and\/or on the differentiated cells themselves; cell types of high
priority include but are not limited to cardiomyocytes, neural cells,
hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and lung (airway or alveolar)
cells.\n\nApproaches can include:\n\nAssays that evaluate the ability of
 chemicals to alter the ability of ES\/iPS cells to be differentiated
into various cell types \nHuman iPS or mouse ES\/iPS cell line panels to
 incorporate genetic variation into toxicity screening. \nEngineered
stem cell lines to simulate the common genetic variants in human disease
 that would predispose to increased sensitivity to toxicants (e.g.,
Parkinson\u2019s Disease, autism, breast cancer, or other relevant
disease models) \nHigh-content screening or \u2018omics-based assays
(metabolomics, proteomics, epigenetic marks, or transcriptomics) for
toxicant-induced effects using differentiated cell types derived from
pluripotent or multi-potent cells. \nAssays should be developed using
toxicants or reference compounds that are appropriate to the endpoints
and purposes of that assay. High priority should be given to including
some compounds that are currently in the Tox21 10k library (see
http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/ncct\/dsstox\/sdf_tox21s.html). The Tox 21 library
 contains samples from commercial sources and includes industrial
chemicals, pesticides, food additives, toxicity reference chemicals, and
 drug compounds.\n\nApplications may develop assays using mouse
embryonic stem cells, adult human stem cells, induced pluripotent stem
(iPS) cells, or human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines that are approved
 for NIH funding as indicated in the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell
Registry (http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/stem_cells\/registry\/current.htm).
If an hESC application proposes research for which the specified hESC
line(s) has not yet been approved, only restricted awards will be issued
 until the specified hESC line(s) is approved\n\nFor this FOA, assays

that initially detects the targets of interest in the open, and the
imager cues may be used to assist in mitigating system false alarms. The
 RF sensor will be responsible for tracking the targets detected by the
imaging system through the woods. The proposed system should be low

performance while minimizing false alarms due to moving foliage or
variable multipath, and have a reliable method for data ex-filtration.
The effort should provide a well-documented path to testing the system
in a heavily wooded environment, with an emphasis on understanding the
phenomenological factors that may limit performance. The mesh network
system is intended to identify personnel that illegally cross the U.S.
northern border in remote locations. This requires that the system is
capable of working in a variety of foliated conditions (broad leaf
forest, pine forests, high grass, etc.) and the range of environmental
conditions that can be encountered on the U.S. northern border
(temperatures, precipitation, and snow). The remote locations and
weather conditions drive the need for a battery powered capability that
can last for 1 year. Auxiliary power capability such as solar or wind

This rise in temperature can be nearly instantaneous and can increase to
 a degree beyond the protective capabilities of the Self-Contained
Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
the firefighters wear. Moreover, although advances in material
engineering have increased the ability of gear to withstand very high

firefighter&amp;rsquo;s awareness of external temperatures. This can
increase the body&amp;rsquo;s core temperature to unsafe levels. This is
 particularly likely during rapid increases in critical situations. In
addition, the structural integrity of the protective gear begins to
degrade as temperatures rise, further endangering the firefighter.
\n\n\tDeveloping an early detection system that informs the firefighter
of a rapid temperature rise, which might not be immediately evident

Such a device should emit an audible, visual, or other recognizable

benefits of the open-access civil GPS signal to varying extents of
dependence. Unfortunately, along with the benefits civil GPS brings to
each of these sectors, it can also introduce dangerous sector
vulnerabilities. By design, civil GPS signals are an open standard and
detailed and accurate specifications of these clear access signals are
readily available for both the legitimate technology developer and
potential adversaries. Intentional, low-cost GPS signal disruption
devices (GPS jammers), while illegal in the United States in most cases,
 are readily available at many internet store fronts. With some off-the

developer weeks of effort, a more sophisticated, software-configurable,
intentional GPS signal manipulation device (GPS spoofer) can be
home-grown and aimed at one of these critical infrastructure sectors.
While civil GPS receiver-based mitigation techniques are under
development or have been implemented in some cases, many are partial
solutions to the potential vulnerability set. Thus, the capability to
detect and localize the source of disruption remains a critical
mitigation requirement across the critical infrastructure sectors. DHS
desires to develop a suite of sensing and reporting technologies to

power lines and\/or damaged or destroyed utility poles or power line
support structures. Electric utility distribution powers and structures
are designed for 90mph winds. However, 3\n\n\trd party attachments
(telecom services, etc.), and other elements of severe weather can
change the loading on a pole. Restoration efforts require crews to
replace the poles\/support structures and restring the power cable in
order to restore power. A quick disconnect type of cable could reduce
excessive loading forces on a utility pole or support structure during
an event and ultimately may prevent damage, allowing for easy and rapid
restoration after an event. \n\n\tThe goal is for the quick disconnect
device\/cable to sense when &amp;quot;disengagement&amp;quot; from the
supporting structure may be necessary, to be able to safely, quickly,
and reliably &amp;quot;disengage&amp;quot; without causing damage to the
 cable or its support structure, and support rapid restoration (i.e.,
the ability to &amp;quot;quick connect&amp;quot; the distribution line
back up) following the event. The system should not impact normal
operations. Preference is for a quick disconnect system that is based on
 existing distribution cable designs (i.e., allows for
retrofit\/installation of quick-disconnect device vs. a completely new
cable system). The quick-disconnect cable system must meet all
applicable ANSI\/IEEE industry standards, as well as any applicable
safety and environmental standards. As downed power lines can pose a
safety threat if they remain energized, the solution should at a minimum
 have a visual indicator to indicate if the line is still energized or
if it has been de-energized. A solution that de-energizes and\/or alerts
 the utility operator when a disconnect occurs is desired. \n",

 in Mental Health Research",
        "description": "\n\tBackground\n\n\tG-protein coupled receptor
proteins (GPCRs) are membrane bound proteins that serve to modulate
cellular activities. Many of the GPCRs have potential significance in
healthy mental function and in mental disorders, including receptors for
 serotonin, glutamate, dopamine, opioids, GABA, orexins, somatostatin,
muscarinic, cannabinoid, adrenergic, Neuropeptide Y, corticotropin
releasing factor (CRF) and others.&amp;nbsp; Drugs targeting GPCRs are
currently used in the treatment of mental health disorders such as
schizophrenia, anxiety and depression.&amp;nbsp; Yet identification or
synthesis of selective agonists and antagonists to these particular
receptor subtypes has proved daunting.&amp;nbsp; A major disadvantage in
 this regard is the lack of knowledge about the three dimensional (3-D)
structure of these receptors.&amp;nbsp; To date, only a few crystal
structures of GPCRs has been identified (including rhodopsin, and more
recently human &amp;szlig;2-adrenergic receptor, human A2A adenosine
receptor, and the &amp;szlig;1-adrenergic receptor).&amp;nbsp; Using
current technologies, researchers have had a difficult time isolating
the protein from the lipid membrane with which it is normally highly
integrated, while still maintaining its structure and
function.&amp;nbsp; In addition, many GPCRs are distributed diffusely in
 the brain, making it difficult to extract large enough quantities of
protein for further analysis.\n\n\tIdentification of the 3-D structures
of these important receptor subtypes could lead to very selective
agonists\/antagonists which could aid researchers in identifying
specific functions of each receptor subtype and potentially lead to
development of more selective pharmacologic treatments for mental
disorders, with fewer side effects.&amp;nbsp; In addition, other novel
tools and approaches that do not require the 3-D structure to be known,
but that would enable researchers to selectively screen for compounds
with high selectivity to the receptor (and minimize side effects) would
be of great value.\n\n\tObjectives\n\n\tThe purpose of this funding
opportunity is to encourage small businesses to develop technologies and
 approaches (i.e., novel ways to use new or existing technologies) that
will enable researchers to better study the structure and\/or function
of brain localized GPCRs and\/or potentially identify novel selective
and specific agonists\/antagonists to these receptor subtypes, with a
focus on mental health function or dysfunction.&amp;nbsp; Technologies
and approaches aimed at either known receptor subtypes or orphan
receptors would be of potential interest to NIMH. Examples include, but
are not limited to:\n\n\t\n\t\tExamples of novel technologies and
approaches needed to further elucidate the function of GPCRs and\/or
identify selective agonists\/antagonists may include one or more of the
following:&amp;nbsp; computational models, high throughput molecular or
cell-based assays, behavioral models, molecular imaging techniques,
novel crystallization strategies, novel technologies and\/or approaches
to increase the yield of GPCR protein, etc.\n\t\n\t\tExamples of
specific tool applications:&amp;nbsp; define structural relationships of
 GPCRs with small molecules, identify orphan GPCRs with mental health
relevance, cell signaling measures, receptor purification,
crystallization and\/or 3-D structure identification,
etc.\n\t\n\t\tExamples of mental health disorders:&amp;nbsp;
schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, eating disorders,

        "description": "\n\tPurpose\n\n\tThe purpose of this funding
opportunity is to support the development and clinical validation of
systems for image-guided interventions (IGIs) for cancer. Specifically,
the goals of this program are to provide support for:\n\n\t\n\t\tThe
development and optimization of fully integrated cancer imaging,
monitoring, and therapy systems;\n\t\n\t\tValidation of integrated
image-guided intervention (IGI) systems through clinical
evaluations;\n\t\n\t\tThe development of multiple prototype integrated
IGI systems as required for multisite clinical evaluations;
and\n\t\n\t\tPartnerships among small business, large business, and
academic clinical centers, as well as small business joint ventures, in
order to reach the research goals.\n\n\n\tThis FOA will use the Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program (R43\/R44) grant
mechanism(s) for Phase I, Phase II, and Fast-Track applications and runs
 in parallel with an FOA of identical scientific intent, PA-10-080 that
encourages applications under the Small Business Technology Transfer
(STTR) program (R41\/R42) grant mechanisms.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tRecent
advances in biomedical technologies that combine imaging with energy-
and drug-delivery capabilities have stimulated the need for an
integrated systems development approach and subsequent clinical
evaluation of IGI for cancer. IGIs may be subdivided into three general
categories: image-guided-diagnosis (IGD), image-guided-surgery (IGS),
and image-guided-therapy (IGT). The common theme of all IGI applications
 is &amp;ldquo;image guidance&amp;rdquo;, linking imaging and
interventions. This crucial linkage implies the need for integration at
both development and application stages of IGI. Historically, research
on IGI technologies has primarily focused on development of components
that perform certain tasks in the IGI process, such as stereotactic
localization or thermal ablation of tumors. Although researchers have
used these systems to establish clinical feasibility, the lack of fully
integrated and optimized IGI systems has been a major obstacle in
further advancement of clinical IGIs in cancer. Furthermore, the
complexity of IGI methods is expected to increase as versatile new
biomedical technologies, such as molecular imaging,
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), nanotechnology, and robotics,
find their way into the interventional suite in order to improve target
identification and treatment efficacy. Hence, there is a growing need to
 go beyond the clinical feasibility stage for components of image-guided
 systems and develop, and clinically evaluate, integrated IGI systems
for treatment of a variety of cancers. The aim of this program is to
stimulate a systems approach for integration and clinical testing of IGI
 technologies for treatment of cancer.\n\n\tThe importance of developing
 oncologic IGI techniques has been emphasized in several recent NCI
Progress Review Group (PRG) reports. Moreover, the significance of small
 business contributions to the field of IGI was emphasized in several
recent IGI-related NCI workshops. In order to meet the objectives of IGI
 systems integration, optimization, and subsequent clinical evaluation,
partnerships between small businesses that develop the component
technologies and major imaging companies that provide the imaging
platforms are encouraged. Moreover, partnerships between small
businesses and clinical sites may be necessary for the clinical
evaluation of IGI products in cancer patients. Because of the complexity
 of the technologies involved, there may be a need for small companies
to develop joint ventures in order to leverage the experience of
different companies and to pool their resources for integration of the
component technologies.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tScope\n\n\tAreas of activity that
 are encouraged for this funding opportunity include, but are not
limited to, research, and development in the integration and
optimization of some or all of the following component systems into an
imaging system as a fully integrated IGI system, and clinical
evaluations of the IGI systems for cancer. The component systems
include:\n\n\t(a)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Energy (e.g., electromagnetic
radiation, heat, cold) delivery and monitoring;
\n\n\t(b)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Drug and gene delivery;
\n\n\t(c)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Real-time data registration, analysis, and
 display; \n\n\t(d)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Robotics;
\n\n\t(e)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and
microfluidics\n\n\t(f)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Nanodevices and
nanoparticles; \n\n\t(g)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Device tracking;
\n\n\t(h)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Physiological monitoring;
\n\n\t(i)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Intraluminal devices,
such as balloons, stents, coils, and endoscopes.\n\n\tIn the context of
this funding opportunity, &amp;ldquo;integration&amp;rdquo; refers to
the integration at the hardware and software levels when appropriate, in
 order to allow centralized, imaging-based operation and control of the
IGI system.\n\n\tExamples of integrated IGI systems include: (i)
combined imaging and ablation systems, (ii) combined MEMS, device
tracking, and imaging systems, (iii) integration of various magnetic
resonance pulse sequences for physiological and anatomical mapping for
targeting and monitoring in IGI applications, (iv) integrated non-rigid
registration, surgical, and imaging system, or (v)
nanotechnology-enabled combined imaging and therapy systems. Clinically
localized primary or metastatic tumors of the brain, lungs, breast,
liver, kidneys, pancreas, prostate, and bone are sites where IGI is
likely to find early applications. Some clinical applications of
integrated IGI systems include: (i) developing a systems approach for
serial acquisition of tissue specimens from solid tumors over time,
including implantable devices, (ii) therapeutic delivery of energies,
drugs, and genes to tumors, (iii) surgical resection of brain or other
tumors guided by real-time physiological and anatomical imaging, and
(iv) IG-diagnosis and therapy of small cancerous lesions in various
organ systems. It is recognized that the complexity of the IG system
proposed and the required level of support will depend on the scope of
the proposed clinical application. Considering that some of the proposed
 cancer applications may require the development of complex systems,
this PA would also encourage small business joint ventures to take a
modular approach toward development of fully integrated systems for IGI
applications in cancer.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tSBIR Phase I
applications may be submitted in response to this initiative for
research on feasibility of systems integration and projection or
modeling of performance characteristics of IGI technologies. Phase II
applications are expected to focus on one or both tasks of integration
and clinical evaluation, depending on the maturity of technologies and
complexity of each task. Therefore, technologies that are close to
integration are expected to move onto early phase oncologic clinical
evaluation during Phase II. This initiative supports the development of
multiple prototype IGI systems as required for evaluations in
multicenter clinical evaluations.\n\n\tThe scope of the PA also includes
 the optimization of new imaging protocols, including anatomical,
functional, and molecular imaging methods and related spectroscopy
techniques required to improve target definition and measurement of the
response to interventions, as part of the overall system integration
optimization and evaluation. When appropriate, collaborations with NCI
funded Centers of Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence
(http:\/\/nano.cancer.gov\/programs\/ccne.asp), and cooperative
agreement imaging research teams, e.g., Network for Translational
Research (U54) and Quantitative Imaging for Evaluation of Responses to
Cancer Therapies (U01), (http:\/\/imaging.cancer.gov\/) are encouraged
to allow for more effective translation of IGI systems. Furthermore,
such collaborations may help the development of a consensus process on
systems validation.\n\n\tCollaboration(s) with existing NCI-funded
center(s) and\/or consortium\/consortia (e.g., those supported by the
NIH P30, U01, U10, U19, U24, and U54 grant or cooperative agreement
mechanisms), where the intent is to encourage a broader consensus for
the proposed translational research methods or the creation of public
research resources for translational research is (are) also
encouraged.\n\n\tWhen appropriate, small business may find
bioinformatics resources in NCI&amp;rsquo;s cancer BioInformatics Grid
(caBIG; https:\/\/cabig.nci.nih.gov\/), the NCI Image Archive
(http:\/\/ncia.nci.nih.gov\/), or the In-vivo Imaging Workspace
(https:\/\/cabig.nci.nih.gov\/workspaces\/Imaging) which provide image
data and open source tools of potential utility to validate IGI systems.
 Furthermore, adaptation of recently established, or under development,
DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine;
http:\/\/medical.nema.org\/) standards for Application Hosting (Working
Group 23) and Surgery (Working Group 24) will allow for more effective
dissemination of IGI technologies in the medical community.\n\n\tOther

objectives of the SHIFT SBIR initiative are to foster research that is
translational in nature and to transform academic scientific discoveries
 into commercial products and services. A major feature of the SHIFT
program includes the opportunity for SBCs to hire skilled academic
investigators (e.g., senior postdoctoral fellow, research associate,

 this initiative is to improve our ability to detect, prevent, and treat
 all forms of cardiac arrhythmias.&amp;nbsp; This initiative will
encourage small business firms to develop improved diagnostic and
therapeutic tools, products, or devices for cardiac arrhythmia
monitoring, detection and treatment.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tCardiac
arrhythmias represent a major source of public health burden and
contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality.&amp;nbsp; For
example, atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac
arrhythmia, affects nearly 4% of the US population over 60 years of age
and is associated with significantly higher risks of stroke and heart
failure.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, ventricular arrhythmias which often result
 in sudden cardiac arrest and death (SCD) are thought to account for
more than 350,000 deaths every year in the US, with an estimated 95% of
the victims of out-of-hospital SCD succumbing to death before reaching
the hospital.\n\n\tAlthough all arrhythmias have in common an abnormal
electrical activity in the heart, their causes vary greatly, and our
understanding of the cellular and molecular signaling pathways and
anatomic substrate involved in arrhythmogenesis remains
incomplete.&amp;nbsp; There are numerous genetic, environmental,
pharmacological, biological, and pathophysiological factors that
contribute to arrhythmias.&amp;nbsp; In addition, lethal ventricular
arrhythmias may occur without warning or prior indication of heart
disease and arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation may confer risk to
patients even when asymptomatic.\n\n\tNHLBI recently convened two expert
 panel Working Groups to identify current challenges and future research
 opportunities in arrhythmia prevention and treatment.&amp;nbsp; Based
on the discussions of recent research advances and emerging
technologies, the expert panels recommended several broad areas of
research and development opportunities for arrhythmia diagnostics and
therapeutics.&amp;nbsp; These include: development of better screening
assays for disease risk assessment or therapy guidance based on new and
emerging discoveries and mechanistic insights (e.g., new gene mutations
or polymorphisms, proteomic and\/or metabolomic biomarkers, etc.);
improvement and optimization of arrhythmia detection algorithms and
analyses to improve current device therapies such as pacemakers,
implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and cardiac
resynchronization devices; development of more effective ablation
therapies; and development of noninvasive arrhythmia detection tools
such as detection and location of arrhythmia susceptible tissue
substrates by anatomical imaging or cardiac tissue conductance mapping
approaches.&amp;nbsp; Further information on the Working Group

 Supplements to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research\n\n\t(See
Funding Opportunity Announcement at
http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/pa-files\/PA-08-190.html.)\n\n\tThe
 NIH recognizes a unique and compelling need to promote diversity in the
 biomedical, behavioral, clinical and social sciences research
workforce. The NIH expects efforts to diversify the workforce to lead to
 the recruitment of the most talented researchers from all groups; to
improve the quality of the educational and training environment; to
balance and broaden the perspective in setting research priorities; to
improve the ability to recruit subjects from diverse backgrounds into
clinical research protocols; and to improve the Nation&amp;#39;s
capacity to address and eliminate health disparities.\n\n\tThe NIH
notifies Principal Investigators holding specific types of NIH research
grants (including SBIR and STTR awards) that funds are available for
administrative supplements to improve diversity by supporting and
recruiting students, postdoctorates, and eligible investigators from
groups that have been shown to be underrepresented in the biomedical,
behavioral, clinical, and social sciences research workforce. Although
the administrative supplements supported under this program provide
funding for less than one percent of all individuals involved in NIH
supported research, the NIH has found these awards to be an effective
means of encouraging institutions to recruit from currently
underrepresented groups. Administrative supplements must support work
within the scope of the original project.\n\n\tAll NIH awarding
components and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
 at the CDC participate in this program. Candidates eligible for support
 under this supplement program include individuals at various career
levels who come from groups that have been shown to be underrepresented
in science. Such candidates include individuals from underrepresented
racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, and individuals
 from disadvantaged backgrounds. Detailed eligibility criteria are
described in the full announcement.\n\n\tAn application for a supplement
 may be submitted at any time. In making requests, the grantee
institution, on behalf of the Principal Investigator of the parent grant
 and in cooperation with the candidate must submit the application for
supplemental funds directly to the awarding component that supports the
parent grant. The application must not be submitted through grants.gov
or to the NIH Center for Scientific Review.\n\n\tRequests for
administrative supplements can be submitted to the NIH Program Official
listed in the contacts section of the FOA PA-08-190 at any time.
Administrative supplements normally end with the competitive cycle of
the parent grant\n",

        "description": "\n\tAvailable to NIH SBIR Awardees\n\t(Note that
 STTR Awardees are not eligible for these programs)\n\n\tOne of the
goals of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is to
&amp;ldquo;increase private sector commercialization of
innovationsdeveloped through Federal SBIR R&amp;amp;D.&amp;rdquo; To
help NIH SBIR awardees move their products into the marketplace, NIH has
 developed several assistance programs that provide technical and\/or
commercialization assistance specific to the individual needs of NIH
SBIR awardees.\n\n\tAdditional information about these programs is
available at http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/funding\/tap.htm.
Questions may be addressed to the NIH SBIR Office at
sbir@od.nih.gov.\n\n\tNiche Assessment Program\n\n\t(For NIH SBIR Phase I
 awardees)\n\n\tThe Niche Assessment program focuses on obtaining the
necessary information for strategizing and making deals. Often, a
research scientist does not havethe entrepreneurial skills to assess
whether there are other applications or market niches for their
SBIR-developed technology. As a result, they may underestimate its true
market value. This program assesses the market opportunities, needs and
concerns of end-users and helps to discover new markets for possible
entry for the SBIR-developed technology. With the assistance of the
participant, a contractor helps identify niches and potential partners.
The contractor performs the due diligence and provides an in-depth
report that assesses such items as the potential end-users needs, the
competing technologies and products, the competitive advantage, the
market size and share that the participant might expect, etc. Targets
(end users) are contacted to ensure they are viable leads and their
contact information is included in the report for possible follow-up.
Participants may find this report helpful in preparing the requisite
Commercialization Plan for a Phase II application. For detailed
information about the Niche Assessment Program, see
http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/funding\/nap.htm.\n\n\tParticipation in
 this program is limited to NIH SBIR Phase I awardees (grants and
contracts) and participants need only commita few hours to inform and
make the contractor fully conversant on their technology and the niche
they would like to have investigated. There is no cost to the NIH SBIR
awardee to participate in this program.\n\n\tCommercialization
Assistance Program (CAP)\n\n\t(For NIH SBIR Phase II awardees)\n\n\tThe
Commercialization Assistance Program (CAP) assists small companies with
getting their SBIR-developed technologies more rapidly into the
marketplace. It provides assistance with developing and implementing an
appropriate business strategy aimed at commercializing the products or
services that have resulted from NIH-supported SBIR awards.\n\n\tCAP can
 include two distinctive tracks that offer customized assistance to meet
 the specific needs of both early stage and seasoned companies: (1)
Commercialization Training Track (CTT), and in some years (2)
Accelerated Commercialization Track (ACT). CTT is aimed at assisting
participants with evaluating their commercialization options based on
their specific technologies and to develop a solid market-entry plan
covering an 18-month period. It also assists in the development of
market-appropriate tools to accomplish these objectives.\n\n\tThe ACT
track assists those companies that may have successfully commercialized
products and\/or services, generated revenue, established partnerships
and\/or otherwise achieved a level of market development that is
sustainable over a definitive period. However, they may be lacking in a
specific, applicable issue (such as a solid regulatory plan, a
license-focused IP strategy or a term sheet for investors), whose
resolution is key to their continued growth.\n\n\tParticipation in CAP
is limited to NIH SBIR Phase II awardees (grants and contracts) from the
 previous five years. Applications to participate are typically accepted
 in early summer. Participation is free to the NIH SBIR awardee;
however, participants are responsible for travel and lodging expenses
associated with attending workshops and partnering investment events.

by persons infected with HIV, HBV, and HCV, is quite common in the
United States. Alcohol consumption is widely acknowledged as a co-factor
 in the sexual transmission, susceptibility to infection, and
progression of the infectious diseases. However, detailed relationships
between alcohol use and viral infections, diseases progression,
antiretroviral therapy and adverse outcomes, notably in liver disease
progression, are less recognized or understood. Recent research
indicates that inflammatory pathways predominate in alcoholic hepatitis
whereas adaptive immunity plays a primary role in viral hepatitis,
offering multiple targets for novel preventive and therapeutic
interventions. Comprehensive studiesto improve understanding of the
factors underlying alcohol and viral etiologies in liver disease and the
 impact of antiretroviral drugs on liver disease progression are needed.

 Exposure and Alcohol-induced Tissue Injury",
        "description": "\n\tAcute and chronic alcohol consumption leads
to health-related complications and ultimately to significant societal
costs. Quantitative and qualitative markers of high-risk drinking
behavior and alcohol-induced tissue damage would greatly improve medical
 efforts to recognize and treat alcohol-related disorders. Traditional
biomarkers currently in clinical use lack specificity, sensitivity, and
accuracy, and fail to provide long-term information. Biomarkers of
sufficient reliability, sensitivity and specificity are likely to be
comprised of a panel of physiological parameters, rather than a single
molecular entity. Thus, NIAAA seeks to support the discovery and
development of pattern-based molecular fingerprints or signatures of
alcohol consumption and of alcohol-induced tissue injury. High
throughput approaches using genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics,
proteomics, metabolomics, lipomics, or glycomics are encouraged.
Biomarker signatures may be composed of multiple genes, RNAs, microRNAs,
 proteins, or metabolites, or combinations thereof. Furthermore,
alterations in lipid, lipoprotein, or glycoprotein profiles may reflect
the metabolic effects of alcohol exposure and may be considered as
potentially predictive. Biomarker signatures that address multiple
aspects of alcohol consumption and alcohol damage are needed. These
include, but are not limited
to:\n\n\tA.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Biomarkers of
long-term alcohol consumption. A biomarker panel reflecting the
cumulative intake of alcohol over a period of months or more would be of
 great diagnostic use, both in terms of recognizing problem drinking and
 in terms of the potential for organ
damage.\n\n\tB.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Biomarkers that
distinguish between binge, acute, moderate and chronic drinking. Each of
 these modes of alcohol intake has different physiological effects. The
ability to distinguish dose and timing of drinking would enhance
clinicians&amp;rsquo; ability to design appropriate treatment and
intervention protocols.\n\n\tC.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Biomarkers of compliance after withdrawal. Biomarker signatures in this
class would be comprised of metabolic products that decrease rapidly
upon abstinence, in contrast to the characteristics of biomarkers that
reflect cumulative alcohol. The ability to detect relapse accurately
will support successful behavioral
interventions.\n\n\tD.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Biomarker
 signatures of alcohol-induced organ damage. The damage due to alcohol
consumption is likely to be organ-specific, with signatures reflecting
alcohol-induced damage likely to be different for heart damage, liver
damage, encephalopathy, a dysregulated immune system, or other alcohol
target.\n\n\tE.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Biomarker

        "topic_name": "Clinical Testing of Biochemical Markers",
        "description": "\n\tThe development of effective biochemical
markers represents a powerful means for early diagnosis and treatment of
 alcohol dependent\/abuse patients and for the identification of
individuals who have a predisposition for alcoholism. There are two
different types of biochemical markers: trait markers and state
markers.\n\n\tTrait biomarkers have the ability to detect inborn
characteristics of individuals who are vulnerable for alcoholism. This
type of marker would be invaluable for screening of high-risk
individuals (e.g., children of alcoholics) and targeting them with
preventive or early treatment interventions. In addition, trait markers
might assist practitioners in identifying subpopulations of alcoholics
who may need different treatment strategies. An ideal trait marker
should have several features. First, it should display validity in
detecting people susceptible to alcoholism, particularly before the
onset of alcoholism or during periods of stable abstinence. Second, it
should be easily and reliably measured. Third, it should be specific for
 alcoholism only and not affected by other medical or psychiatric
disorders or drugs. Since alcoholism is a complex disease, it is likely
that more than one type of gene and protein exist as trait
marker.\n\n\tState markers or markers of alcohol consumption serve
several important purposes. First, they can assist physicians in
diagnosing individuals with chronic drinking problems, particularly
patients who deny excessive drinking. Moreover, they may also identify
individuals in early stages of heavy drinking, thus avoiding the
long-term medical, psychological, and social consequences of chronic
alcoholism. Second, state biomarkers can aid in the diagnosis and
treatment of other diseases (liver diseases, pancreatitis, and
cardiovascular diseases) that were, at least, caused by excessive
drinking. Third, they are useful in alcohol treatment and prevention
programs. Since the goal of many of programs is abstinence, monitoring
relapse is important in gauging success. Last, state biomarkers are
important in clinical alcohol trials. Although self-reports have become
more sophisticated and valid (e.g., Timeline Followback), they still
rely on accurate reporting. These new and reliable biomarkers could then
 be used to confirm the self-report. Several biomarkers with certain
limitations are currently in use including carbohydrate-deficient
transferrin (CDT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase\n\n\t(ALT), and mean
corpuscular volume (MCV). New state markers need to be developed that
incorporate the following attributes: validity, reliability, stability,
cost, practicability, acceptability, and transportability.\n\n\tAreas

        "description": "\n\tThe mission of the NlDA is to lead the
nation in bringing the power of science to bear on drug abuse and
addiction, through support and conduct of research across a broad range
of disciplines and by ensuring rapid and effective dissemination and use
 of research results to improve prevention, treatment, and policy. For
additional information about areas of interest to the NIDA, please visit
 our home page at http:\/\/www.nida.nih.gov\/. SBIR and STTR programs at
 NIH are primarily intended to encourage private-sector
commercialization of technology and to increase smallbusiness
participation in federally funded R&amp;amp;D.\n\n\tBoth the SBIR and
STTR programs consist of the three phases. During Phase I, NIDA supports
 the projects which establish the technical merit and feasibility of
proposed research or R&amp;amp;D efforts and determines the quality of
performance of the applicant (small business concern or SBC) before
providing further Federal support in Phase II. During Phase II, NIDA
supports the extension of the research or R&amp;amp;D efforts initiated
in Phase I. Only Phase I grantees are eligible to receive Phase II
funding. During Phase III, the small business concern (SBC) is to pursue
 commercialization with non-SBIR\/STTR funds (either Federal or
non-Federal). Applicants are encouraged to seek commitment(s) of funds
and\/or resources from an investor or partner organization for
commercialization of the product(s) or service(s) resulting from the
SBIR\/STTR grant. Phase III funding may be from any of a number of
different sources including, but not limited to: SBIR\/STTR firm itself;
 private investors or &amp;ldquo;angels&amp;rdquo;; venture capital
firms; investment companies; joint ventures; R&amp;amp;D limited
partnerships; strategic alliances; research contracts; sales of
prototypes (built as part of this project); public offering; state
finance programs; non SBIR-funded R&amp;amp;D or production commitments
from a Federal agency with the intention that the results will be used
by the United States government; or other industrial firms. NIDA
monitors SBC efforts to pursue, with non-SBIR\/STTR funds, the
commercialization of the results of the research or R&amp;amp;D funded
in Phases I and II of the SBIR\/STTR Program.\n\n\tWhile making funding
decisions, NIDA will carefully examine that proposed research has both
the potential for commercialization and public benefit. NIDA funding
decisions will be based on combination of factors: the review scores;
theresults of Phase I and the commercial potential and
scientific\/technical merit of the Phase II application (for Phase II
applications); the quality of performance of the applicant, including
the success in Phase III for the applicants with the previous history of
 SBIR\/STTR support; programmatic priorities and portfolio balance; and
availability of funds.\n\n\tSpecial Features of NIDA SBIR
Program\n\n\tFast-Track Applications\n\n\tThe NIH Fast-Track mechanism
expedites the decision and award of SBIR and STTR Phase II funding by
incorporating a submission and review process in which both Phase I and
Phase II grant applications are submitted and reviewed together. The
Fast-Track application will receive a single rating for the entire
proposed project (i.e., it will receive a numerical score or it will
receive an &amp;ldquo;unscored&amp;rdquo; designation). To be eligible
for the Fast-Track option, the Phase I Research Plan must include
well-defined, quantifiable milestones that should be achieved prior to
initiating Phase II work. In addition, as is required for all Phase II
applications, the Phase II portion of a Fast-Track application must
present a Commercialization Plan. NIDA encourages Fast-Track mechanism
for scientifically meritorious applications that have expressly high
potential for commercialization, specifically. Applicants considering a
Fast-Track application are strongly encouraged to contact program staff
before submitting an application. Among the issues which potential
Fast-Track applicants are encouraged to discuss with the NIDA program
staff are: Value of the SBIR\/STTR Project, Expected Outcomes, and
Impact (the proposed project and its key technology objectives; the
product, process, or service to be developed in Phase III; the need
addressed, specifying weaknesses in the current approaches to meet this
need; the commercial applications of the research and the innovation
inherent in this application; the potential societal, educational, and
scientific benefits of this work; the non-commercial impacts to the
overall significance of the project); Market, Customer, and Competition
(the market and\/or market segments targeted, a brief profile of the
potential customer, significant advantages SBC&amp;rsquo;s innovation
will bring to the market, e.g., better performance, lower cost, faster,
more efficient or effective, new capability, the hurdles to overcome in
order to gain market\/customer acceptance of the proposed innovation,
any strategic alliances, partnerships, or licensing agreements already
in place to market and sell the product, FDA approval (if required),
marketing and sales strategy, overview of the current competitive
landscape and any potential competitors over the next several years,
etc.\n\n\tAmount of Award\n\n\tFor budgetary, administrative, or
programmatic reasons, NIDA may decrease the length of an award and\/or
the budget recommended by a review committee, or not fund an
application. In general, NIDA advises to keep the amount of requested
funds within $150,000 - $300,000 total cost per year for up to 2 years
(Phase I) and up to $1,000,000 total cost per year for up to 3 years
(Phase II). Applicants considering a requested budget greater than these
 limits are strongly encouraged to contact program staff before
submitting an application.\n",

Competing Renewalgrant applications from Phase II SBIR\/STTR awardees to
 continue the processof developing products that require approval of a
Federal regulatory agency. Such products include, but are not limited
to: drugs, vaccines, medical implants, or other treatment or diagnostic
tools that require FDA approval. This renewal grant should allow small
businesses to get to a stage where interest and investment by third
parties is more likely.\n\n\tTransitioning a new molecular entity from
preclinical to the clinical phase of development, requires large-scale
production of the new molecular entity and toxicity testing, activities
which are both costly and time consuming. The cost and time constraints
imposed by advanced stage development of a new molecular entity pose
significant obstacles for small businesses. Although Phase I and Phase
II SBIR support is sufficient for initial discovery efforts (e.g.,
compound synthesis and some in vitro and in vivo preclinical
pharmacological testing), it is neither adequate to support necessary
developmental preclinical work needed to comply with the FDA regulations
 , nor sufficient to conduct clinical trials.\n\n\tThe purpose of Phase
II Competing Renewal Award is to provide Phase II awardees a chance for
another three years of support. It is recognized that an award of this
type may not support the entire medications development timeline for any
 given drug. The Competing Renewal grant will however, provide small
businesses with opportunity to further advance the development of its
product \/medication from the preclinical to the clinical stage, which
will aid in attracting interest and investment by third, parties, and
provide an important sustained resource for new pharmaceuticals aimed at
 the safe and effective treatment of substance abuse.\n\n\tPlease
contact Kris Bough (contact information provided below) before beginning
 the process of putting an application together. Prospective applicants
are strongly encouraged to contact NIH staff prior to submission of a
Phase IIB Competing Renewal application and to submit a letter of intent
 that includes the following
information:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

 Names of other key
personnel\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Participating institutions\n\n\tAlthough a letter of intent is not
required, is not binding, and does not enter into the review of a
subsequent application, the information that it contains allows NIH
staff to estimate the potential review workload and plan the review. It
is expected that only a portion of NIDA SBIR\/STTR Phase II awards will
be eligible for a Phase IIB Competing Renewal grant.\n\n\tThe following
examples would make appropriate topics for proposed SBIR or STTR Phase
IIB Competing Renewal projects. These are meant for illustrative
purposes only and are not exclusive of other appropriate
activities.\n\n\tResearch and development efforts can be focused on
medications for the treatment of cocaine, methamphetamine, and other
stimulant abuse, as well as towards opiate, prescription opiates,
cannabis, PCP or club drugs. The medications under development should be
 targeted towards attainment of abstinence and\/or relapse
prevention.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Preclinical studies, including pharmacology and toxicology, beyond
those conducted under the initial SBIR Phase I and Phase II grants. The

        "description": "\n\tIn this Omnibus Solicitation, NIDA
emphasizes its need to discover, evaluate and develop medications (both
small molecules and biologics) to treat substance use disorders (SUDs).
NIDA further emphasizes an importance of fostering research through NIDA
 SBIR\/STTR Program aimed at the research and development of medications
 for SUD, as well as research aimed at modernizing the drug discovery
and development toolkit.\n\n\tHigh programmatic priority will be given
to research that seeks to achieve these goals in the following
ways:\n\n\t1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Drug discovery and
 development-enabling activities: Development of innovative
technologies, methods or tools, including but not limited
to:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Innovative in vitro, in situ,&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;in

diagnosis and treatment of substance use
disorders\n\n\t2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Drug discovery
 and development activities: Application of emerging and existing
technologies and platforms to SUD drug development. This includes the
identification, evaluation, development, approvability, and efficacy
testing of new and improved pharmacotherapeutic agents, as well as the
testing of marketed medications, and of behavioral treatments used alone
 or integrated with medications. Medical products with potential to
minimize drug seeking, compulsive behavior, and\/or addictive processes
are strongly
encouraged.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

 Development of biomarkers related to treatment outcomes\n\n\tResearch
Topics which are not aimed at development of medications for
substance-use disorders or at modernizing the drug discovery and
development toolkit, will have low program priority.\n\n\tSpecific
projects could include:\n\n\tHuman Brain Neurochemical and Molecular
Imaging. Measurement of brain neurochemistry, neuropharmacology
(receptors) and gene expression in humans using non-invasive imaging has
 lagged behind advances in these areas in pre-clinical research as well
as in functional and anatomical neuroimaging in humans. There is a
continuing need for development of new ways to measure molecular targets
 in the human brain. Examples include, but are not limited to novel
radioligands for PET and SPECT imaging in human brain for molecular
targets (e.g., receptors, intracellular messengers, disease-related
proteins), as well as novel methods that use magnetic resonance imaging
or other emerging technologies such as optical imaging.. The primary
application of these methods will be in basic human research.
Ultimately, these measures may also be used as potential biological
markers and surrogate endpoints for translational and clinical research,
 drug discovery and development, and clinical trials. The scope of the
projects may encompass pilot or clinical feasibility evaluation in
pre-clinical studies, model development, or clinical studies.
Alternatively, the focus may be on research and development of new
technologies for molecular, neurochemical or neuropharmacological
development.\n\n\tSteven Grant, Ph.D. 301-443-4877; Email:
sgrant@nida.nih.gov\n\n\tDevelopment of Assays for
&amp;quot;Designer&amp;quot; Drugs of Abuse Based on Pharmacologic
Activity Rather Than Chemical Structure. Contemporary illicit drug
chemists have turned to the pharmacology literature to produce new
&amp;quot;designer&amp;quot; drugs of abuse including (but not limited
to) synthetic cannabinoid analogues found in &amp;ldquo;herbal
incense&amp;rdquo; mixes or substituted cathinone stimulants sold as
&amp;ldquo;bath salts&amp;rdquo;. This new strategy has resulted in a
diverse range of potential modified structures, all of which maybe
pharmacologically active but each of which varies in molecular weight
and substituents. This presents a substantial complication to
traditional toxicology screens conducted in Emergency Rooms and to drug
testing laboratories, whose assays rely on either immuno-assays or
mass-spectrometry to detect specific agents. The current Funding
Opportunity Announcement therefore aims to sponsor the development of
assays based on pharmacologic activity rather than chemical
structure.\n\n\tSuch assays should
be:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Non-invasive and able to detect quantities of illicit materials or
metabolites in a range of concentrations typically found biofluids of
substance users within a few days of
use.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Access to the biofluid samples should be minimally invasive and provide
 for temporal analysis. Such sample types include blood, urine, sweat
and oral
fluids.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Assays should be designed with a standard clinical or analytical
laboratory in mind, i.e., to be analyzed in a high throughput format by
technicians with a moderate scientific
training.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 The assays can be either designed to be analyzed with standard existing
 equipment, or include both the assay and development of analytical
hardware, provided that the ultimate system can be commercially viable
in a clinical and drug testing market
place.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Assays should be designed to remain relevant as illicit substance
chemists adapt to legislation by altering pharmacophoric substituents
such as side chains. Examples of such assays would include (but be not
limited to) scintillation proximity assays, robust cell-based assays to
detect pharmacology rather than a particular chemistry, or cells
expressing engineered receptors activated solely by synthetic ligands,
designed to pick up a range of metabolites. Other examples might include
 microfluidic surface plasmon resonance devices, which can both
concentrate and detect receptor or antibody-bound substances.\n\n\tAidan

SBIR applications are encouraged which propose to discover new chemical
compounds as biological probes either by synthesis or isolation from
natural resources in studying the mechanisms of action of drugs of
abuse. Such substances could be new chemical compounds, drug products,
or peptides. Currently there are several ligands available through the
NIDA drug supply system such as SR 141716A, SR144528, CP 55,840,
anandamide, epibatidine, Kaffiralin 1 and 2, etc. All probes for
cannabinoids, neuropeptides, nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptors and
related probes for drug abuse study are encouraged. In addition
applications on biological screening of such new compounds as potential
ligands for drug abuse research will also be considered.\n\n\tRao S.

electrophysiological methods to identify and characterize new
medications to treat substance abuse, as well as pharmacological
screening of novel compounds to identify potential drug abuse
medications. This also supports research on toxicity studies of
potential medications for the treatment of substance abuse, and
interactions of potential treatment medications with abused substances.
Areas that may be of interest to small businesses include, but are not
limited to, development of new methods for discovery of medications
useful in treating drug addiction. Of special interest would be the
development of new animal models of addiction, incorporating established
 drug self-administration techniques that show increased relevance to
the clinical setting. Development of relevant biochemical or
electrophysiological screening methods is also encouraged.\n\n\tClinical
 Drug Development.&amp;nbsp; Within this area, NIDA seeks to support the
 clinical development of compounds that have completed (or are nearing
completion of) successful preclinical evaluation of a novel
pharmacotherapeutic- or immunological treatment(s) for persons with
SUDs. Products can be evaluated in any Phase of clinical development, I,
 II, or III. Treatments should aim to help subjects become drug free,
mitigate drug use, prolong abstinence\/reduce craving, and\/or
facilitate survival from drug overdose. Whereas it is expected that all
clinical trials testing a novel medication will provide a behavioral
therapy component, the scope of this funding announcement does not
provide for the evaluation of the safety and\/or efficacy of
psychosocial interventions.\n\n\tTherapies that a small business might
consider developing include, but are not limited
to:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Repurposing of a compound developed for other indications (e.g., SSRIs,
 anti-epileptic drugs) that could be used to treat
SUDs.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 A novel (e.g., NCE, novel drug formulation) that could be used to treat

SUDs\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Vaccines for substances of abuse (e.g., cocaine,
nicotine)\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Monoclonal antibodies for substances of abuse (e.g., methamphetamine,
PCP)\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Naturally-occurring compounds (e.g., dietary supplements) that could be
 used to treat
SUDs\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Or, a rationalized poly-therapeutic combination of pharmacotherapies
designed to more comprehensively treat SUDs\n\n\tTreatments that
concurrently help alleviate associated psychiatric co-morbidities (e.g.,
 depression, schizophrenia, PTSD, anxiety, etc.) and\/or are focused
upon underserved\/vulnerable populations (e.g., pregnant women and their
 fetuses, adolescents, racial or ethnic minorities, women\/gender
issues, subjects within the criminal justice system) are also
encouraged.\n\n\tAlso of special interest are products that incorporate
technological advances to more efficiently develop novel therapeutics
for SUDs, such
as:\n\n\t1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Improved methods to assess patient compliance during clinical trials
(this can also include statistical
modeling).\n\n\t2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Improved adjuvants to boost antibody responses to drugs of
abuse.\n\n\t3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Discovery \/ development of biomarkers related to SUDs treatment
outcomes. Because drug addiction is a brain disease which can change the
 structure and function of the brain, there is a unique opportunity to
develop biomarkers that could reliably predict\/assess SUD treatment
outcome. To date, evaluations of SUDs often utilize subjective measures
(e.g., patient-reported questionnaires) to assess disease progression
and primary treatment outcomes. Biomarkers represent a more objective
measure of physiological functioning that can be used to predict,
diagnose, evaluate the progression of, and\/or more accurately assess
overall treatment safety and effectiveness. The goal of this initiative
is to support the small business discovery\/development of reproducible,
 quantitative biomarkers related to SUD treatment outcomes. Potential
biomarkers might be derived from underlying variations in DNA, gene
expression, proteins, metabolism, and\/or neuroimages, among others.
This solicitation is open to fast-track
applications.\n\n\t4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Improved methods that can predict oral bioavailability of drug-like
substances (in vitro; in vivo, in silico). For example, this might
include the development of an innovative test \/device that can be used
to help more effectively diagnose and\/or manage patients with SUDs. The
 use of this novel diagnostic tool might help to: (a) expedite the
development of-, and\/or (b) enhance existing treatments for patients
with SUDs. Possible diagnostic tests\/devices that a small business
might consider, but are not limited to,
include:\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; An assay\/device (e.g., skin
sensors, oral swabs) that detects a substance of abuse more reliably
than oft-used urinalysis. Optimally, the analytical test\/device would
be non-invasive and easy-to-use, such that it could be used on an
outpatient basis.\n\n\to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Discovery\/development of a
 diagnostic test\/screen that could help physicians more effectively
manage treatments for patients with SUDs.\n\n\tKristopher Bough, Ph.D.

        "topic_name": "Tools for Improved Exposure Assessment",
        "description": "\n\tFundamental to the NIEHS mission is the
ability to quantify an individual&amp;rsquo;s exposure, as well as the
unique characteristics that account for individualized responses to the
exposures. The goal for improved exposure assessment is to develop new
technology and assays to generate precise measurements of human exposure
 to chemical and biological agents that may lead to disease or
dysfunction. The desired application of these technologies and assays is
 in population-based (epidemiological) or clinical research and
practice. An emphasis is placed on tools that provide individual
exposure metrics either at the point of contact or through measuring
internal dose of environmental agents.\n\n\tIt is anticipated that the
new technologies and assays, such as those based on micro- and
nanotechnology and molecular imaging, may provide sensitive,
high-throughput, and potentially portable systems capable of measuring
exposure to environmental agents and the impact of the exposures on
human biology.\n\n\t1.&amp;nbsp; Technologies for Generating Precise
Measurements of Internal Dose of Environmental Agents\n\n\tThe NIEHS
supports the development of technologies and devices to generate precise
 measurements of internal dose of individual environmental agents and or
 their metabolites in real time and over time. It would be especially
valuable to analyze multiple agents within a single class or multiple
agents across more than one class. The development of a modular design
allowing measurement of specific classes of chemical exposures for
application in epidemiological studies (e.g., pesticides,
endocrine-active chemicals, toxic metals, or components of indoor air
pollution) is preferred. Approaches that combine detection of individual
 analytes together with functional assays, e.g., measures of total
estrogenicity or genotoxicity, are also encouraged. Likewise, an
emphasis is placed on measuring environmental factors with mixed routes
of exposure (i.e., inhalation, ingestion, and dermal exposure) for which
 biomonitoring is the only comprehensive exposure metric. In addition,
NIEHS is interested in the development of economical technologies and
approaches for storing human biological samples for long periods for
subsequent analyses of analytes or macromolecules. Methods to store
dried blood spots, urine samples, etc. with low cost, minimum storage
requirements, and minimal degradation of sample quality are
needed.\n\n\tExamples include but are not limited
to:\n\n\tA.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Development of
sensors for measuring the levels of toxicants in biospecimens easily
obtained from an individual, such as finger prick of blood, buccal
cells, hair, exhaled breath, meconium, or
urine.\n\n\tB.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The development
of integrated devices linking exposure at the point of contact, internal
 dose, and biological response.\n\n\t2.&amp;nbsp; Wearable Technologies
for Personal Exposure Assessment at the Point of Contact\n\n\tThe NIEHS
is interested in developing and validating new products\/devices, tools,
 and assays to improve our ability to precisely measure an
individual&amp;rsquo;s exposure to environmental agents, with high
temporal and spatial resolution. Ideally, the technologies, tools and
assays will be of appropriate scale to be field deployable and\/or
wearable. These point-of-contact devices should be capable of measuring
simultaneously and in near real time, multiple agents within a single
exposure class (e.g., multiple types of metals, multiple size fractions
of particulate matter, multiple components of diesel exhaust) and\/or
multiple agents across more than one exposure class. Exposures of
interest include ozone, particulate matter, diesel exhaust, metals
(e.g., arsenic, cadmium, or mercury), volatile organic compounds,
polybrominated diphenyls (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs), mold\/microbial toxins, allergens and pesticides\/herbicides.
Examples include but are not limited
to:\n\n\tA.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Novel technologies
and assays to generate precise, quantitative measures of human exposure
to environmental compounds at the point of contact or in easily obtained
 biological samples (e.g., skin, breath, saliva, or nasal mucosa). An
emphasis is placed on the ability to measure multiple analytes
simultaneously.\n\n\tB.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Remote
sensing technologies for detecting, quantifying, and monitoring
household exposures to toxicants and\/or
bioaerosols.\n\n\tC.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

standardizing, and validating sensitive and specific innovative tests
and integrated testing strategies that can reduce, refine, or replace
animal use and that will provide improved predictivity, and potential
cost and time savings compared to current standard laboratory animal
tests (i.e., assays for carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity, reproductive or
 developmental toxicity, dermal toxicity, and neuro or other organ
system toxicity including acute local and systemic toxicity); and (2)
developing mid- and high-throughput screens and tests using
phylogenetically lower animal species (e.g., insects, fish, worms) to
evaluate mechanisms of toxicity to identify mechanisms of
chemically-induced biological activity, prioritize chemicals for more
extensive toxicological evaluation, and develop more predictive models
of in vivo biological response. The proposed tests and strategies should
 use computational and\/or biochemical models, cell\/ tissue cultures,
and\/or animal models that are relevant to existing safety assessment
databases and human experience, and that can be extrapolated to estimate
 risks to humans. The endpoints for these tests or assays should take
advantage of the new technologies such as genomics, transcriptomics,
proteomics, and bioinformatics and of novel endpoints (biomarkers)
including those that are non-invasive. Examples include but are not

taking into account, for example, metabolism, the ability of chemicals
to pass through barriers (i.e., blood brain, kidney, lung,
gastrointestinal), and organ specific effects, or which allow the
development of endpoints that can be extrapolated to in vivo biomarkers
of toxicity. An emphasis is placed on the development of engineered 3D
tissue systems that include multiple cell types and that replicate the
anatomy and function of intact tissue. Of particular interest are
systems that replicate key functions of major organs (e.g., skin,

is more likely. Such products include, but are not limited to biological
 products, devices, drugs, medical implants, etc. related to the mission
 of the NIGMS. The previously funded Phase II SBIR grant need not have
been submitted in response to a particular solicitation, as long as the
research is appropriate to the purpose of this solicitation. Budgets up
to $750,000 total costs per year and time periods up to 2 years may be
requested for this Phase IIB Competing Renewal opportunity. These awards
 are intended to support completion of research needed to obtain an IND
or IDE. Applicants must provide evidence that they have consulted
formally with the FDA concerning the research needed for the development
 of a drug, biologic or medical device and that the proposed research
will address these regulatory requirements. Such evidence should include
 FDA correspondence from a pre-IND meeting for an IND application or a
pre-IDE meeting for an IDE application, and the status of the project in
 a timeline related to Federal regulatory approval
processes.\n\n\tProspective applicants are strongly encouraged to

 developed with considerable input from the scientific community. These
plans have always laid out ambitious goals and measurable objectives to
gauge progress. NHGRI initiated its most recent planning process in 2008

advances that have marked genomics and have allowed genomic applications
 to transform many important fields made it an opportune time for the
Institute to take a new look at genomics and its future.\n\n\tThe

realization of the genomics-based vision for biomedical research require
 continued technological and methodological developments before pilots
and then large-scale approaches can be attempted. Accordingly, the NHGRI
 will continue to support the development of new, fundamental
technologies in all areas of genomics. Important areas in which
technology development applications would be responsive to this Program
Announcement include (but are not limited to) analyses of gene
expression, discovery and characterization of genetic variation;
identification of the genetic contributions to health, disease, and drug
 response; statistical analytic methods for understanding human genomic
variation and its relationship to health and disease; and chemical
genomics. There is also continued interest in supporting technology
development for the comprehensive discovery of functional elements in
the human and model organism genomes, and new DNA sequencing technology.
 Many of these assays would benefit from the ability to work with very
small amounts of starting material, to the limit of single cells. As
these technologies mature, emphasis should be on high throughput,
cost-effective methods that consistently produce very high quality
data.\n\n\tThe Institute is also interested in contributing selectively

businesses who have received previous SBIR grants, have had success in
commercializing their previously supported technologies. Small
businesses that are mostly interested in research and development (and
not commercialization) should consider other grant mechanisms at NIH,

 The NIMH will accept Phase IIB SBIR Competing Renewal grant
applications in two categories: 1) to continue research and development
of technologies that ultimately require federal regulatory approval, and
 2) to continue research and development of complex instrumentation,
clinical research tools, or behavioral interventions and
treatments.\n\n\tTechnologies in the former category (those that
ultimately require federal regulatory approval) include, but are not
limited to: pharmacologic agents and drugs, biological products, medical
 devices, vaccines, etc., related to the mission of the NIMH. Phase IIB
SBIR Competing Renewal grants for such technologies should allow small
businesses to get research and development to a stage where interest and
 investment by third parties is more likely. Companies engaging in drug
development for the treatment of mental health disorders may be eligible
 to submit Competing Renewal applications through the specific funding
opportunity announcement PA-11-133 entitled &amp;ldquo;Complex
Technologies and Therapeutics Development for Mental Health Research and
 Practice (R43\/R44)&amp;rdquo;
http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/pa-files\/PA-11-133.html. For
this specific opportunity, budgets up to $1.0 million total costs per
year and time periods up to three years may be requested.\n\n\tCompanies
 that are developing technologies that do not focus on drug development,
 but that require federal regulatory approval prior to
commercialization, may be eligible to submit a Phase IIB Competing
Renewal application through the Omnibus SBIR funding opportunity
announcement. For this opportunity, budget limits of up to $800,000
total costs per year and time periods up to 3 years may be
requested.\n\n\tThe following examples would make appropriate topics for
 proposed NIMH SBIR Phase IIB Competing Renewal projects. These are
meant for illustrative purposes only and are not exclusive of other
appropriate
activities:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Preclinical studies, including pharmacology and toxicology, beyond
those conducted under the Phase I (R43) and initial Phase II (R44)
grants. Some in vivo or in vitro studies would be expected to have been
carried out in Phase I or the initial Phase II
grant.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Completion of studies as required by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for Investigational New Drug (IND) or Radioactive Drug Research
Committee (RDRC)
application.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Studies in normal healthy volunteers to determine a drug&amp;rsquo;s
safety profile, metabolism,
etc.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Clinical studies in patient\/disease population to assess the
drug&amp;rsquo;s
effectiveness.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Assessment of devices with regard to performance standards related to
the FDA approval
process.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Safety and effectiveness studies of novel medical
devices.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Evaluation of novel imaging approaches for diagnostic
purposes.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Clinical studies in support of Pre-Market Approval for
biomarkers\/medical devices by the FDA.\n\n\tAlthough technologies in
the latter category listed above (complex instrumentation, clinical
research tools, or behavioral interventions\/treatments) may not require
 federal regulatory approval, extraordinary time and effort is needed
for their research and development. Therefore, NIMH supports Phase IIB
Competing Renewal awards of existing Phase II grants for such
technologies. The Phase IIB Competing Renewal award for these would
provide up to an additional three years of support at total cost funding
 levels of up to $800,000 per year.\n\n\tPlease contact the Program
Director in the appropriate Division or Dr. Margaret Grabb (listed
below) before beginning the process of putting an application together.
In addition, prospective applicants are encouraged to submit to the
program contact a letter of intent that includes the following
information:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

 Funding Opportunity Announcement (e.g. PA-11-135).\n\n\tAlthough a
letter of intent is not required, is not binding, and does not enter
into the review of a subsequent application, the information that it
contains allows NIH staff to estimate the potential review workload and
plan the review. It is expected that only a portion of NIMH SBIR Phase
II awards will be eligible for a Phase IIB Competing Renewal grant.\n",

 accomplish this, NIMHD plans, reviews, coordinates, and evaluates all
minority health and health disparities research and activities of the
National Institutes of Health; conducts and supports research in
minority health and health disparities; promotes and supports the
training of a diverse research workforce; translates and disseminates
research information; and fosters innovative collaborations and

development leading to novel and or improved products capable of
contributing to NIMHD&amp;rsquo;s mission. Research and development may
proceed and or be initiated at the molecular, cellular, individual,
community or population level. Funding support for focus groups, phase
I\/II clinical trials, and other studies as needed to develop and test
the proposed product may be requested. Additionally, NIMHD seeks
innovative strategies that engage, collaborate, or partner with health
disparity communities for designing and delivering innovative products
and services to improve minority health and eliminate health
disparities.\n\n\tAn overarching objective of NIMHD&amp;rsquo;s
investments in SBIR\/STTR programs is to ensure that health disparity
populations benefit equally from innovations in health promotion and
prevention, biotechnology, imaging technologies, technologies for
computational biology and informatics, including for example, systems,

Against Chemical Threats (CounterACT) program. CounterACT supports
research and development on new and improved therapeutics or diagnostic
technologies to prevent or mitigate the toxic effects from exposure to
chemical threats, defined as toxic chemical agents that could be used in
 a terrorist attack against civilians, or those that could be released
at toxic levels by accident or natural disaster. This includes the
development of new (or support of existing) partnerships between small
business and not-for-profit laboratories engaged in this research. The
scope of research supported includes early screening for compounds with
the desired biological activity, advanced preclinical and efficacy
testing, through clinical research with promising candidate
therapeutics. For more information on this program, including specific
program announcements, please see: www.ninds.nih.gov\/counteract.

of CDC&amp;prime;s mission. Each of CDC&amp;prime;s component
organizations undertakes these activities in conducting its specific
programs. The steps needed to accomplish this mission are also based on
scientific excellence, requiring well-trained public health
practitioners and leaders dedicated to high standards of quality and
ethical practice.\n\n\tTokeep pace with emerging public health
challenges and to address the leading causes of death and disability,
the CDC has begun an effort to quickly achieve measurable impact in a
few targeted areas. The term &amp;quot;Winnable Battles&amp;quot;
describes public health priorities with large-scale impact on health and
 with known, effective strategies to intervene. The charge under
Winnable Battles is to identify optimal strategies and to rally
resources and partnerships to accelerate a measurable impact on
health.\n\n\tCDC has identified these winnable battles based on the
scope of the burden and our ability to make significant progress in
improving outcomes. These priority areas
include:\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Food Safety&amp;ndash; Foodborne diseases affect millions of people and
 kill thousands in the U.S. each
year.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Global Immunization&amp;ndash; CDC is implementing global immunization
programs to eradicate polio, prevent measles and rubella, end the
meningitis epidemic in Africa, accelerate the introduction of
pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines, and strengthen countries&amp;#39;
own immunization
systems.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Healthcare-associated Infections&amp;ndash; HAIs affect patient lives
and add to our growing healthcare
costs.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 HIV&amp;ndash; There are more than 1 million people living with HIV in
the
U.S.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Lymphatic Filariasis in the Americas- CDC and its partners are working
to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF) from the areas of the Americas
where the disease still
exists.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV and Congenital Syphilis- CDC works
with Ministries of Health and other partners to prevent HIV and syphilis
 from passing from mothers to babies, thus reducing the number of babies
 who suffer early death and\/or chronic illness caused by these
infections.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Motor Vehicle Injuries&amp;ndash; Motor vehicle-related injuries are
the leading cause of death in the first three decades of
life.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity&amp;ndash; Excess weight
contributes to many of the leading causes of death in the United States,
 including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and some types of
cancer.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Teen Pregnancy&amp;ndash; In 2009, the number of births to teenage
mothers was 409,840 &amp;ndash; a birth rate of 39.1 per 1,000 women
aged 15 to
19.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Tobacco&amp;ndash; Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of
 disease and death in the United States.\n\n\tBy identifying priority
strategies and clear targets and by working closely with our public
health partners, we can make significant progress in reducing health
disparities and the overall health burden from these diseases and

 Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) by the Use of Embodied Conversational
Agents to Improve Discharge Planning and Transition of Care",
        "description": "\n\tBackground: VTE is estimated to newly affect
 300,000 to 800,000 people and to cause 60,000 to 100,000 deaths each
year, making it one of the six leading causes of death in the US. About
one-quarter of new cases occur during a hospital stay and another
one-quarter within 3 months after discharge. Up to 50% of hospital
associated VTEs can be prevented through use of prophylaxis. The DHHS
Partnership for Patients has set as a goal a 50% reduction in VTE
occurring prior to discharge and a 20% reduction in 30 day readmissions
with VTE. Reducing VTE readmissions requires that at risk patients be
educated regarding their risk and prevention behaviors. New tools are
needed to educate at risk patients and motivate them to adhere to
recommended measures.\n\n\tEffective discharge and transition care
planning is limited by low health literacy and nursing staff time.
Interactive computer software for discharge planning, utilizing Embodied
 Conversational Agents (ECA a.k.a avatar), shows promise in addressing
both limitations. In one study 78% of patients rated overall
satisfaction with the ECA as &amp;ldquo;very satisfied.&amp;rdquo;
Patients with inadequate health literacy rated the ECA as favorably as
patients with adequate health literacy. Redesigned discharge planning
and transition of care employing ECA was associated with a 30% reduction
 in all-cause hospital readmission and emergency department visits
within 30 days of discharge. The effectiveness of these techniques in
reducing VTE associated hospital readmission has not been established.
If successful such software and techniques could be readily adopted by
almost all hospitals and lead to substantial reduction of VTE 30 day
readmissions.\n\n\tThis funding opportunity invites small businesses to
submit proposals to adapt interactive computer software utilizing ECA
for discharge and transition planning for patients at risk of VTE to
specifically address VTE prevention messages and to assess the effects
on 30 day readmission rates associated with a VTE for patients who were
on anticoagulation or mechanical prophylaxis while
hospitalized.\n\n\tSpecific Research Areas of Interest: Businesses that
are already active in this area are most likely to apply and will have
requisite knowledge in relevant scientific program areas.\n\n\tImpact
and Commercialization Potential:VTE is a CMS priority hospital
associated condition (HAC). Reducing in-hospital VTE is being addressed
through other initiatives. Reducing 30 day readmissions after VTE will
depend on improved discharge planning, patient education, and
coordination of post discharge transition care. Innovative solutions
utilizing ECA software have been shown to address two limitations in the
 discharge process and achieve substantial all cause 30 day
readmissions. Similar success in reducing 30 day readmission related to
VTE will be a significant public health advance. Given the priority of
this condition nearly every hospital in the country will be a potential
customer for an effective program. A successful program could generate
substantial commercial rewards.\n",

Disabilities Manage Their Own Care",
        "description": "\n\tBackground: Over 50% of Americans have a
chronic illness and 20% have disabilities. Chronic illness often leads
to functional disability. Disability and chronic illness cost over $260B
 every year, including preventable hospitalizations, emergency room
visits and surgery for wounds, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and
sepsis. Clinicians could more efficiently manage patients in greater
numbers through telemedicine that provides triage, timely intervention
and preventative care that has traditionally been carried out in person.
 This proposal seeks to further develop and test a unique telemedicine
portal linked to smartphone applications (apps) that enable clinicians
to remotely monitor and triage the self-care activities of patients.
Patients can be given apps customized to manage their own care of issues
 like clinical appointments, medications, supplies, bladder and bowel
programs, skin integrity, depression, nutrition and exercise.\n\n\tThe
system proposed here is unique, because it would allow patients and
clinicians to have two-way-communication. The proposed system would
allow patients to alert clinicians when new problems arise (e.g. urinary
 tract infection), report specifics about their medical problems (e.g.
size of a pressure sore), ask questions, refill medications, make
appointments, or seek medical advice. It would automatically send
reports when gaps in care arise (e.g. medications have not been
refilled). At the same time, clinicians could monitor the self-care
activities being completed by patients, receive alerts when there are
problems, triage large groups of patients, and intervene quickly before
problems arise.\n\n\tIt should be customized for individual patient
needs and inclusive of people with cognitive and physical impairments.
The proposed system would be mobile device-friendly, capable of giving
clinicians access to data obtained from a patient&amp;rsquo;s own home,
work, or leisure environments. It also would allow clinicians to collect
 data that could then interface with existing electronic health
records.\n\n\tSpecific Research Area of Interest:Application of smart
phone technology to improve health outcomes by systematic, interactive
monitoring of physical variables and adherence to intervention
routines.\n\n\tImpact and Commercialization Potential:By improving
medical outcomes and delivery of care and reducing cost, resources could
 be redirected from expensive, often inaccessible, in-person care to
care based on consumer-centered technology, informed decision-support
and patient participation. Commercialization potential is broad and
encompasses many patient groups with chronic conditions (like arthritis,
 obesity, cardiopulmonary disease, spina bifida and spinal cord
injuries) who are seeking greater autonomy over health and wellness
interventions. Mobile app downloads are predicted to jump from 7 billion
 in 2009 to almost 50 billion in 2012. Smartphone apps are expected to
enable the mobile health industry to successfully reach out to 500
million of a total 1.4 billion Smartphone users by 2015. One-half of US
health consumers are willing to engage in online care and consultation.
More than 50% of physicians are using Smartphones or PDAs on a regular
basis for everyday treatment activity.\n",

health concern affecting 1 in 33 infants. Today, approximately 67% of
birth defects have unknown causes. As part of the mission to prevent
birth defects, NCBDDD is collaborating with 8 state-based grantees on
the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS). The NBDPS is an
on-going, large, multi-site, population-based case-control study to

 Development of a Brief Video Intervention for Preventing Teen Pregnancy
 Among Female Adolescents Attending Family Planning
Clinics\n\n\tBackground: Teen pregnancy continues to pose a health and
social burden in many US communities, particularly among racial\/ethnic
minorities, and has been deemed a CDC Winnable Battle. Most
evidence-based behavioral interventions related to teen pregnancy
prevention, however, are multi-session, group- or individual-level, and
require substantial resource investments and time commitments from
providers and clients. These interventions can be difficult to implement
 at scale and to sustain over time. Conversely, simple interventions,
such as video interventions, can effectively deliver prevention messages
 because of their relative low cost, ease of implementation, likely
acceptability, broad reach, and high likelihood of being adopted and
sustained. There is increasing evidence that video interventions can
reduce adverse reproductive outcomes. For example, a 23-minute
&amp;ldquo;soap opera&amp;rdquo; style waiting room-delivered
video-based intervention, Safe in the City, recently was shown to reduce
 new sexually transmitted diseases by nearly 10% among a study sample of
 approximately 40,000 high-risk inner-city STD clinic patients (see
http:\/\/www.stdcentral.org\/SitC). The proposed activity will result in
 development of a new video that contains the elements contained in a
video-based intervention such as Safe in the City that integrates
prevention messages regarding unintended pregnancy into an appealing
product for adolescents at high risk of unintended pregnancy. The
intervention should be designed in such a way as to directly impact
rates of unintended pregnancy.\n\n\tSpecific Research Areas of Interest:
 The proposed activity will require an applicant with experience
developing video interventions in sexual and reproductive health or
related areas, expertise in use of behavior change theory to guide
intervention development, working with interdisciplinary groups such as
governmental agencies and community advisory boards. CDC is further
interested in the applicant conducting formative research to explore
strategies for enhancing message appeal for young women (e.g., focus
groups and in-depth interviews), and understanding of implementation
issues across clinical settings in which the new video could be used.
Enhancements to the video structure (e.g., gaming) to further engage
viewers is encouraged. One awardee will develop the video through an
iterative process with appropriate subject matter experts to ensure
broad appeal and acceptability of characters, content, and design. Given
 that most evidenced-based programs for teen pregnancy prevention have
examined the impact on sexual risk behavior as a proxy for teen
pregnancy rates, future activities could include an evaluation of
effectiveness of the video on teen pregnancy rates directly.\n\n\tImpact
 and Commercialization Potential: Video interventions offer immediate
public health benefit because the simplicity of the intervention permits
 wide reach and immediate dissemination capability. In the Safe in the
City example, dissemination to community partners began the day the
primary outcome article was published whereas this process of
dissemination typically requires two or more years to complete for other
 effective behavioral interventions. In the first 12 months of
availability, more than 2,000 clinics (i.e., STD clinics, family
planning clinics, and community health settings) requested the video,
and a six month follow-up evaluation of clinic directors has shown high
intervention uptake. From a marketing perspective, development of a
health video for purchase offers commercialization opportunities for
applicants.\n\n\tFor NCCDPHP programmatic information,

 Development of a Desktop\/Smartphone Software Application for Patients
Using Antiretroviral Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention\n\n\tBackground: The
 National HIV\/AIDS Strategy tasks CDC to develop, evaluate, and
disseminate interventions to reduce HIV incidence in the US (one of
CDC&amp;rsquo;s Winnable Battles). Effective use of antiretroviral
prophylaxis for HIV prevention requires that tools be provided to
patients and their providers to help identify levels of risk for HIV
acquisition, provide plain language guidance to patients of all literacy
 levels, and support adherence to medications and clinical monitoring.
Mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) and desktop applications are ideally
suited for these purposes because they allow individuals to tailor use
according to individual needs, and can facilitate sharing of information
 between patients and providers. According to one recent survey, 1 in 6
mobile subscribers own a smartphone and many who do not, have access to
computers at work, home, or in public spaces (e.g., public
libraries).\n\n\tSpecific Research Areas of Interest: The development of
 this technology should include some or all of the following features:
1) an HIV risk calculator (e.g.,
http:\/\/www.rmdstudio.com\/projects\/94-coronary-heart-disease-risk-calculator-iphone-app)
 that incorporates behavioral, demographic, and local prevalence factors
 using a GPS or zip code look-up function (e.g.,
http:\/\/www.aidsvu.org), 2) a medication adherence reminder and
monitoring function (e.g., http:\/\/www.dosecast.com), 3) a symptom
checklist with prompts for urgent physician contact when indicated
(e.g., http:\/\/www.ihealthventures.com\/app_details.php?aid=107970), 4)
 a clinical visit reminder function (e.g.,
http:\/\/www.ihealthventures.com\/app_details.php?aid=99707), and 5)
access to plain language, graphical displays of information for
low-literacy users. Additional potential features include: support for
push to peer support network sites (e.g.,
http:\/\/www.caringbridge.org\/), methods (with unique identifiers) to
allow an option of sharing information with clinical providers (e.g.,
http:\/\/www.welldocinc.com\/Products-and-Services\/Our-Products.aspx)
that meet all applicable federal security standards for confidential or
personal data, and support for risk behavior monitoring over time (e.g.,
 http:\/\/www.livestrong.com\/quit-smoking-app\/).\n\n\tImpact and
Commercialization Potential: High efficacy of antiretroviral prophylaxis
 in preventing HIV infection is only achieved with high adherence to
daily medication and safe use requires regular clinical monitoring
visits. Yet early studies indicate that adherence and persistence in
care are often lower than needed (in some studies &amp;lt;50%). Mobile
personal health applications are widely available for non-HIV conditions
 but this product would fill a needed market for HIV prevention in
clinical settings. The personal &amp;ldquo;app&amp;rdquo; market has
demonstrated significant commercialization potential and the anticipated
 number of users for this application would be significant.\n\n\tFor

        "description": "\n\tBackground: Each year, the U.S. Coast Guard
received reports over 4,500 boating incidents where more than 3,000
boaters are injured, and around 700 die. Among those who drowned, 9 out
of 10 were not wearing life jackets. Most boating fatalities are caused
by drowning with 90% of victims not wearing life jackets (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. Wide-ranging OnLine Data for
Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) [online]. (2010) Available from URL:
http:\/\/wonder.cdc.gov\/mortsql.html).\n\n\tFor those who take to the
water for occupational purposes, the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) estimates
during 1982-1987, the annual occupational fatality rate for U.S.
commercial fishermen was 47 deaths per 100,000 workers. The major cause
of these deaths was drowning. According to information gathered by
CDC&amp;rsquo;s Alaska Activity, the occupational fatality rate for
commercial fishermen in Alaska during 1991-1993 was 195 deaths per
100,000 workers -- nearly 30 times the average annual rate for all U.S.
workers. Of these 195 deaths, 91% were caused by drowning. Data clearly
show that life jackets greatly increase the chances of survival for
fishermen: 63% of fishermen wearing life jackets when they jumped or
fell into the water survived, whereas only 12% of those without life
jackets survived. These conclusions and recommendations may apply to all
 commercial fishing operations in the United States.\n\n\tPublic Health
Impact: Studies have shown that the majority of drowning incidents were
precipitated by unexpected entry into the water, which means the victim
had no time to grab a life jacket before entering the water. Many of the
 drowning incidents could have been prevented by wearing a life jacket.
Common reasons given for not wearing a life jacket include being 1)
uncomfortable and 2) expensive. A newly designed life jacket that
addressed these issued has the potential to increase use and decrease
morbidity and mortality from drowning. It is believed that awide array
of retail and commercial outlets (specialty outdoor retail stores,
warehouse stores, and convenience stores) will have an interest in this
product.\n\n\tSpecific Research Areas of Interest: Todevelop a
comfortable, lightweight, compact, inexpensive, and easy to use life
jacket that could be worn for recreational and\/or occupational
activities (boating, kayaking, fishing, etc.) to reduce the risk of
drowning.\n",

Injury Severity of Motor Vehicle Occupants to Emergency Medical
Personnel",
        "description": "\n\tBackground:Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) have
 been noted as a leading cause of death and injury among adults and
children in the United States. In 2009, more than two million adults
were treated in emergency rooms for injuries related to motor vehicle
crashes. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
 has identified this problem as a winnable public health battle and has
focused efforts on the prevention of crashes as well as reducing the
effects of crashes after they occur.\n\n\tOne method of decreasing the
effects of motor vehicle crashes is the development of Advanced
Automatic Collision Notification (AACN) systems. AACN systems are
described as a mechanism of sensors placed in automobiles that will
activate during events such as airbag deployment or tightening of
seatbelt pre-tensioners and will subsequently initiate an emergency
wireless call to a telematics service provider. This system can then
deliver such information as GPS location of the vehicle along with
crash-related data that can be used by emergency responders and will
also open a voice channel for communication with the driver. Development
 of AACN technology includes prediction of injury scores for passengers
in the vehicle using data such as speed of the vehicle, change in
velocity, number of persons in the vehicle at the time of crash and
other data pertinent to optimal field triage of victims. The use of this
 type of system is proposed to decrease response time to vehicle crashes
 and in turn will save lives.\n\n\tA current area of discussion in AACN
is how to transmit predicted injury scores to emergency medical
personnel in real time in order to efficiently allocate emergency health
 services. This includes dispatching emergency medical personnel,
activation of trauma centers if needed and providing medical personnel
with accurate information on injury severity that will aid in the
delivery of care once the injured occupant arrives at a definitive care
location.\n\n\tPublic Health Impact:Research has indicated that reducing
 time to definitive care can reduce mortality by up to twenty-five
percent. Much of this care for severely injured patients is provided at
trauma centers. Therefore, development of mechanisms that can quickly
and accurately relay injury information to all medical personnel can
reduce both the morbidity and mortality of injured motor vehicle
occupants as well as reduce healthcare costs by providing real time
information for efficient allocation of services.\n\n\tExamples of
specific research areas of interest, but not limited to: The CDC is
interested in the development of methods to communicate predicted injury
 scores in real time across the continuum of emergency medical services.
 This will entail the creation of new medical decision making models and
 the necessary technologies that inform not only AACN providers and
first responders, but also definitive care providers such as trauma
surgeons and emergency department personnel. Crash information that is
collected at the time of crash and transmitted in real time to all
levels of emergency medical response will reduce time to definitive
care, and prepare providers with quick and reliable information that
will result in decreased morbidity and mortality.\n",

Systems to Reduce Older Adult Falls",
        "description": "\n\tBackground: Falls and their associated
injuries are a growing public health concern&amp;mdash;responsible for
over 19,000 deaths and 2.2 million emergency department visits
nationwide, and costing over $28 billion annually. Clinical assessment
and individualized risk factor reduction is effective in reducing falls
and fall injuries. The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) has published
practice guidelines to promote falls risk assessment and management.
However, awareness of the AGS guidelines among health care providers is
low. Primary care providers report that they do not know how to assess
fall risk or do not have adequate knowledge about fall prevention. To
address these concerns and fill this identified knowledge gap, CDC has
used the AGS guidelines in conjunction with formative research methods
to develop STEADI, a comprehensive fall prevention toolkit for
healthcare providers.\n\n\tPublic Health Impact: TheUS population is
ageing. People aged 85 and older are the fastest growing segment of the
elderly population as well as those with the highest risk of falls and
fall injuries. On an individual basis, healthcare providers can prevent
falls through clinical falls risk assessment, treatment and referral.
This process could be streamlined by integrating the STEADI provider
toolkit into electronic medical records (EMR) systems. Such an
integrated system would facilitate the assessment process and simplify
referrals to appropriate providers, as well as demonstrate cost savings
by reducing fall-related injuries and hospitalizations.\n\n\tSpecific
research areas of interest: CDC is interested in the development of
EMR-compatible technology that will facilitate healthcare
providers&amp;rsquo; use of fall risk assessment procedures, treatment,
and referral within the office practice setting and would simultaneously
 streamline health care reimbursement procedures. Such technology would
help providers improve clinical care while at the same time increasing
efficiency, improving patients&amp;rsquo; health outcomes, and lowering
health care costs related to falls and fall injuries.\n\n\tFor NCIPC

occupational hazards in high risk industrial sectors. These include
manufacturing, services, mining, agriculture and construction sectors.
Workers in the manufacturing sector, comprising an estimated 14 million
paid workers in 2005, face risks that include machinery, repetitive
motion, over-exertion, chemicals, nanomaterials, noise and shift work.
In the services sector, work environments vary widely and these varied,
and often uncontrolled, environments may put the estimated more than 65
million workers at risk of workplace injury, illness and death. The
mining sector, comprised of over 300,000 paid workers in 2005 (not
counting those in the oil and gas extraction sub-sector), face risks
that include falling materials, explosions, fires, powered haulage,
overexertion, electrical equipment, and exposure to particulates and
dusts including diesel emissions, coal dust and silica dust.
Agricultureranks among the most hazardous industries. Farmers are at
high risk for fatal and nonfatal injuries, work-related lung diseases,
noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, and certain cancers
associated with chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. Farming is one
of the few industries in which the families (who often share the work
and live on the premises) are also at risk for injuries, illness, and
death. Each day, construction workersface injury hazards from falls,
machines, electricity, motor vehicles, and other equipment and
circumstances. Health hazards posed by construction work can include
dusts, fumes, noise, and chemicals. Research is needed to develop
control strategies, PPT, exposure assessment methods and interventions

as well as from the specific threats of exposures to certain airborne
biological particles, chemical agents, nanomaterials, splashes, noise
exposures, fall hazards, head hazards, and fires. It is estimated that
20 million workers use PPE on a regular basis to protect them from job
hazards and a total of 135,000 workers potentially could benefit from
the use of PPE (Worker Health Chartbook 2004). Engineering controls
include substitution of a safe material for a hazardous one, design

exposures. Respiratory protection research needs to be extended to a
broad range of engineered
nanomaterials.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Develop a heads-up display coupled with a personal noise exposure
monitoring system. Personal noise alert &amp;ldquo;badges&amp;rdquo; and
 personal noise dosimeters exist, but do not have an effective way to
alert the user immediately when a noise hazard occurs. A system that
displays a warning within the user&amp;rsquo;s visual field (via lights

recognition.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Develop an inexpensive hand-held earplug test device based on the NIOSH
 QuickFit concept. Studies of hearing protector users have shown
repeatedly that average protection values are much lower than the
labeled Noise Reduction Ratings (NRR) determined in laboratories. A
QuickFit test system would help workers determine if their hearing
protection is giving them at least 15 decibels of
attenuation.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Develop innovative engineering control approaches and technologies for
reducing asphalt exposures in roofing, and skin exposures and disease in
 construction
workers.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Conduct research to understand PPE integration and interoperability
issues. In most cases, individual PPE are currently used without
consideration for their ability to function together. Research is needed
 to test interfaces among different PPT and components. Current
interfaces do not provideseamless integration of PPT components

improving workplace safety and health. For example, to what extent can
mobile application media be focused on worker safety and health to
provide up-to-date PPT information to a diverse range of employers and
employees&amp;rsquo; through portable communication devices?\n\n\tImpact
 and Commercialization Potential:The impact of the proposed research

detecting nanoparticles and providing information on size distribution
and count, and that can be used for personal monitoring; and 2.
Development of methods that can detect and quantify the presence of
engineered nanomaterials in samples collected for the purpose of
characterizing exposures. These methods need to be cost-effective and
available to the OS&amp;amp;H practitioner community. Broader
application to general public health assessments should be factored into
 the
research.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Develop new or improved methods to measure occupational health
stressors such as psychological and ergonomic factors, noise, chemicals,
 particles and fibers, physical agents, non-ionizing radiation, or
mixtures of stressors in the work environment. Enhanced measurement
performance and functionality can include sensitivity, selectivity, size
 and weight considerations, ease of use, and capabilities to measure
multiple analytes
simultaneously.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Develop or adapt easy-to-use, direct-reading instruments and test kits

 exposure that can be used in underground coal
mines.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Improve the measurement of low concentrations of chemicals and
biomarkers in biological specimens such as blood, urine, saliva and
sweat so that such concentrations can be linked to internal dose at the
target organs, work tasks and workers can be categorized according to
hazard bands and exposure bands, and at-risk workers can be identified
and protected.\n\n\tImpact and Commercialization Potential: This
research will lead to the development of practical solutions and

of innovations to apply evidence-based interventions for occupational
occurrences of motor vehicle crashes and incidents. Priorities include
developing new design concepts and standards that may be used by
national standardization groups to update or develop design standards
for specific motor vehicles, enhancing effective interventions for
driver education and behavior to reduce motor vehicle incidents and
crashes among professional drivers, evaluating intervention strategies
for their effectiveness in reducing the number or severity work-related
motor vehicle incidents and crashes, and enhancing engineering controls
for the prevention of crashes and incidents or reducing the severity of
traumatic injury associated with such crashes and incidents.\n\n\tPublic
 Health Impact: Application of evidence-based interventions may have a
large impact on reducing the incidence occupational motor vehicle
crashes and incidents. Workers sustaining fatal or serious injuries
represent a huge toll on future years of productive life. In addition,
their families are adversely affected. Any reduction in occurrence will
have tremendous public health importance. In addition, reductions in
occurrence will also have beneficial impacts on reducing
workers&amp;rsquo; compensation and health insurance premiums and
improving the productivity of American businesses. Given the extremely
short induction period between exposure and injury occurrence, CDC can
make a measurable difference in a very short period of time (&amp;lt; 4

 vast range of food Americans eat; about 80 percent of all food sold in
the United States. This includes everything except for the meat,
poultry, and processed egg products that are regulated by the USDA.
Consequently CFSAN seeks research designed to complement and accelerate
efforts aimed at the detection, prevention, and control of contamination
 that may be responsible for illness or injury conveyed by foods,
colors, and cosmetics. CFSAN conducts research, and develops
regulations, guidance and standards related to the composition, quality,
 nutrition, and safety of food, food additives, colors, and cosmetics.
The Center evaluates FDA&amp;rsquo;s surveillance and compliance
programs relating to foods, colors, and cosmetics; reviews industry
petitions, and develops regulations for food standards to permit the
safe use of color and food additives.\n\n\tCFSAN maintains an active
research program that is focused on the following priorities; ensuring
the safety of food, dietary supplements and cosmetics; improving
nutrition; and promoting the security and integrity of the food supply.
The Center&amp;rsquo;s research activities are intended to; support the
FDA&amp;rsquo;s regulatory activities; reduce the incidence of foodborne
 illness by improving our ability to detect and quantify foodborne
pathogens, toxins, and chemicals that could jeopardize the safety and
security of the food supply; find new and improved ways to control these
 agents; and safely produce, process, and handle food and food products.
 FDA is committed to reducing the incidence of foodborne illness to the
greatest extent feasible while at the same time protecting the
nation&amp;#39;s food supply. Mission-critical knowledge gaps are
addressed through translation research focused on the risks associated
with FDA regulated products throughout their life cycles, from
production to consumption. Ideally extramural research is sought that
complements the Center&amp;rsquo;s intramural research efforts, and
which will enhance the Agency&amp;rsquo;s and the Nation&amp;rsquo;s
ability to reduce the incidence of foodborne illness and protect the
integrity of the nation&amp;rsquo;s food supply. FDA&amp;rsquo;s
mission-critical needs require that the research not simply end with the

treatment and save lives. The primary purpose of an asymptomatic
infection test would be to determine non- exposed, exposed and infected
individuals and to triage the cohorts to the appropriate care for the BT
 agent and to determine that an individual could discontinue
post-exposure prophylaxis. Asymptomatic infection tests have additional
non-medical applications, including triage and reducing fears among
concerned citizens, which in turn, may prevent large numbers of
asymptomatic individuals from descending on medical facilities.
\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCritical to the success of an emergency response is
the ability to administer these types of tests to large numbers people
and to provide timely results in a &amp;lsquo;near patient&amp;rsquo;
setting. Consequently these tests must be field deployable and have
either a low resource requirement (e.g. lateral flow assays with visual
readout) or harness established, widely used point-of-care technologies
(e.g. as used for blood glucose monitoring). \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSpecific
Research Areas of Interest: The most effective early diagnostic test for
 B. anthracis infection is detection of anthrax toxins in the blood.
This approach is also advantageous in monitoring the effectiveness of
medical countermeasure intervention. However, the current best practices
 for quantifying anthrax toxemia are laboratory based and require
specialized equipment. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCDC has prepared a panel of key
 reagents that potentially may be developed into high sensitivity and
specificity &amp;lsquo;near-patient&amp;rsquo; point of care tests. CDC
holds intellectual property on certain aspects of these reagents. The
objective of this SBIR will be to develop these reagent panels to
provide high specificity, high sensitivity field deployable tests for
early identification of B. anthracis infection that are not negated by
antimicrobial or vaccine interventions. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImpact and
Commercialization Potential: In vitro diagnostic assays have a critical
role in defining the medical needs and expediting the appropriate
prophylaxis of an exposed population following a BT event. In the 2001
anthrax letter events, using the post-mark date as the exposure time
point, the median number of days to onset of illness in the first case
cluster was 10 days (range 4-13 days) and in the

estimated at 4.5 days. In these individuals, on average, those who
survived inhalation anthrax started antimicrobial treatment 4.7 days
after symptom onset. Those who died started antibiotic treatment 5.8
days after symptom onset. The rapid and early diagnosis of case-patients
 with anthrax is therefore of paramount importance in saving lives.

        "topic_name": "Commercialization of a Serologic Kit for
Pertussis",
        "description": "\n\t\n\t\tBackground: Pertussis, also known as
whooping cough, is the most poorly controlled childhood vaccine
preventable disease with 27,550 U.S. cases reported in 2010. The
etiologic agent, Bordetella pertussis is a fastidious organism and
difficulties associated with diagnosis by culture or polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) make public health surveillance challenging. Isolation of
 B. pertussis by culture requires several days to perform and suffers
from a lack of sensitivity. PCR can provide increased sensitivity and
more timely results but similarly to culture, the sensitivity of PCR
decreases with the duration of cough. Therefore, it is a useful tool for
 diagnosis only for the first three to four weeks of coughing.
\n\t\n\t\tSerologic testing for pertussis infection has the potential
advantage of markedly improving diagnostic sensitivity. Serologic
measurement of pertussis antibodies would be helpful in cases where
paroxysmal coughing has been present for weeks (2 to 8 weeks) or in
adults in whom the typical features of pertussis are absent. Currently,
except for Massachusetts, the Council of State and Territorial
Epidemiologists (CSTE) case definition does not include serologic
confirmation; however, multiple serologic tests with unknown clinical
accuracy are commercially available. CDC in collaboration with Center
for Biologics Research and Review (CBER), US Federal Drug Administration
 (FDA) has developed and analytically validated a single serum\/single
dilution IgG anti-pertussis toxin (PT) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
 (ELISA) for diagnosis of pertussis, using the cut-off of 94
International Units (IU)\/mL. This quantitative and qualitative assay
has proven very useful in confirming pertussis outbreaks and efforts for
 its clinical validation are underway with testing of over 700
individuals with cough illness completed. Improving laboratory testing
capabilities is essential to meet public health objectives for the
prevention and control of B. pertussis infections. The overall aim of
this proposal is to ensure that a validated serodiagnosis assay is
commercially available for surveillance, control and prevention of
pertussis. \n\t\n\t\tSpecific Research Areas of Interest: CDC has
prepared a panel of key reagents including 6 standards and 3 controls
that potentially may be developed into a high sensitivity and
specificity commercial serodiagnosis test for pertussis. Before
serodiagnosis can be used in pertussis surveillance, possible
interfering factors, such as recent vaccination with a vaccine
containing the same component as that measured by the ELISA, need to be
identified. Recent CDC kinetic data (Pawloski et all 9th International
Bordetella Symposium, 2010) have demonstrated that receipt of Tdap
vaccination six months before testing did not confound interpretation of
 this ELISA. This seroassay remains a valuable diagnostic tool for adult
 pertussis infection even after Tdap vaccination. The objective of this
SBIR will be to make this assay widely available as a commercial kit to
be used for identification of B. pertussis infection during the late
stage of disease when culture or PCR are no longer positive.
\n\t\n\t\tImpact and Commercialization Potential: CDC and FDA co-own the
 intellectual property of this in vitro diagnostic test as published
(Clin. Vaccine Immunol., 6:1781-8, 2009) and propose to make it a
marketable product that can be accessed by local and state public health
 institutions as well as reference labs involved with pertussis
diagnosis. \n\n",

        "topic_name": "Kenya Enhanced Cookstoves for Health (KECH)",
        "description": "\n\tBackground: Indoor smoke from cooking with
biomass fuels leads to over 1.5 million premature deaths each year,
world-wide. In particular, acute respiratory infections (ARI) cause
nearly one-fifth of child mortality globally. Poor indoor air quality is
 a recognized risk factor for ARI in children (Wall, 2000; Bruce, 2000).
 Much of the poor indoor air quality in developing countries is
attributed to incomplete combustion of biomass using simple stoves, such
 as the three-stone firepits used in rural Kenya. Improved stoves
\n\n\t\n\t\thave been developed that decrease smoke output and are
relatively simple to construct with locally available materials and
skilled labor. However, results from pilot studies evaluating locally
produced suggest that, although these stoves remove visible smoke and
are very acceptable to the local population (&amp;gt;2200 sold), they
were not found to be effective in reducing particles less than 2.5
microns in diameter (PM2.5) to levels of exposure that would likely have
 an impact on childhood pneumonia and health outcomes.
\n\t\n\t\tSpecific Research Areas of Interest: The goal of this program
is to develop technology to enhance the performance of existing biomass
cookstoves to reduce particulate emissions (PM2.5) by &amp;gt;=85% as
compared to the traditional three-stone fire. A reduction in emission at
 this level is expected to have significant impact on child and maternal
 health. \n\t\n\t\tPhase I: Conduct a feasibility demonstration of a
proposed stove enhancement technology with an existing stove to show a
&amp;gt;=85% reduction in emissions as compared to the traditional
three-stone fire. This will involve the development and testing of a
prototype to confirm performance in a laboratory environment.
\n\t\n\t\tPhase II: Conduct a field trial of no less than five prototype
 devices to enhance the performance of biomass cookstoves in Kenya. In
coordination with CDC representatives in Kenya, tests will be conducted
to evaluate the performance of cookstoves with and without the stove
enhancing prototypes. The goal is to confirm &amp;gt;=85% reduction in
emissions as compared to the traditional three-stone fire.
\n\t\n\t\tPhase III: Conduct reliability testing for critical components
 of the prototype device to confirm successful operation for over 5000
hours of typical field use. In addition to accelerated laboratory
evaluation of reliability, this program will expand the Kenya field
trial to 30 devices. The safety of the cookstove with an enhancement
component will be assessed. \n\t\n\t\tImpact and Commercialization
Potential: The expected results will help identify a technology that can
 be disseminated in Kenya households through using social marketing
approach, that will reduce exposures to indoor air pollution, and
improve health outcomes. This proposal addresses the following CDC
public health priorities: 1) Increase global health impact; 2) Better
prevent illness, injury, disability and death. We will approach this new
 technology commercialization through a variety of approaches, including
 commercial spin-off companies and technology licensing. \n\t\n\t\tFor

        "topic_name": "RNAi Cancer Therapeutics using Nanotechnology",
        "description": "In 2011, the SBIR Development Center hosted an
industry roundtable to solicit inputs from life science industry
professionals on emerging areas that are ripe for technology development
 by the small business community. Participants at this meeting expressed
 strong interest in using the SBIR mechanism to foster and encourage the
 development of novel RNA interference (RNAi) delivery platforms,
particularly as a strategy for addressing therapeutic targets previously
 deemed \u201cundruggable\u201d by small molecules. Such therapeutics
are gaining prominence due to their versatility and efficiency in
treating cancer, as well as a variety of other genetic diseases;
however, treating patients with RNAi has proven challenging, as it is
difficult to achieve intracellular delivery to specific tissues and
organs expressing the target gene. In particular, cellular uptake of
naked RNAi is extremely inefficient owing to its polyanionic nature. The
 majority of intravenously administered RNAi is removed from circulation
 by hepatic and renal clearance, and the remaining RNAi is subject to
degradation by nonspecific nucleases in the blood. Moreover, injecting
large quantities of RNAi may elicit an immune response, and other
\u201coff-target\u201d effects may result in toxicity. While RNAi
delivery to tumor cells poses these and other challenges, the ability to
 overcome these challenges is expected to facilitate the development of
new and highly efficacious anti-cancer agents. Nanoparticle-based
delivery systems are especially attractive as such strategies afford the
 opportunity to target specific cell, tissue, and organ types, while
also increasing circulation half-life and shielding RNAi from
degradation. Importantly, ongoing clinical trials are successfully
utilizing nanoparticle-based delivery systems for cancer-related RNAi
therapeutics, indicating that nanotechnology-based approaches hold great
 promise. To accelerate such efforts, the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) requests proposals for the development of novel, commercially
viable nanotechnology-based platforms for the delivery of RNAi cancer
therapeutics.\nProject Goals\nProposals submitted under this contract
topic should involve the design, fabrication, characterization, and
preclinical evaluation of novel nanoparticle-based drug formulations
capable of delivering candidate RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of
cancer. Of particular interest are delivery systems that can achieve
targeted delivery of RNAi to tumor cells, favorable pharmacokinetics and
 circulation times, and efficient uptake of RNAi by tumor cells.
Nanotechnologies which minimize immune responses and\/or off-target
effects of RNAi are also desirable.\nNanotechnology-based RNAi
therapeutic agents acceptable under this contract topic include siRNA,
shRNA, miRNA, other ncRNA(s) and combinations thereof. Antisense
oligonucleotides are also acceptable. This contract topic is not
intended to fund basic research to identify molecular targets for RNAi
therapy, conduct exhaustive comparative studies of multiple nanoparticle
 delivery systems, or establish new animal models. Concepts delivering
DNA, messenger RNA, and\/or proteins are also not acceptable candidates
for this topic, nor are viral delivery platforms for RNAi.\nThe
RNAi-nanoparticle constructs under development may incorporate
additional functionalities to supplement or enhance the therapeutic
RNAi. Such functionalities may include, but are not necessarily limited
to, the following:\n\u2022 Novel nanoparticle delivery vehicles\n\u2022
Constructs involving novel tumor targeting\n\u2022 Novel RNAi loading
and releasing schemes\n\u2022 Nanoparticle constructs capable of
crossing the blood-brain barrier, penetrating pancreatic stroma,
overcoming multi-drug resistance, or treating metastatic cancer\n\u2022
Combination therapies utilizing multiple RNAi payloads (e.g., RNAi-based
 Logic Circuits)\n\u2022 Other combination therapies utilizing at least
one RNAi therapeutic and one conventional chemotherapeutic agent (i.e.,
non-nucleic acid agent)\nPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables\n\u2022 Provide a detailed experimental strategy to develop
 and deliver the RNAi\/nanotherapeutic, and identify an appropriate
cancer indication(s) for the nanoconstruct containing the
RNAi(s)\n\u2022 Encapsulate and\/or attach the selected RNAi therapeutic
 agent(s) to the nanoparticle\n\u2022 Demonstrate nanoconstruct
stability in vitro, and demonstrate controlled release of the RNAi
therapeutic agent(s) from the nanoconstruct\n\u2022 Perform in vitro
efficacy studies in the relevant cancer cell line(s): (a) quantitate
knockdown of the target gene transcript(s) and demonstrate a \u226570%
reduction in the corresponding protein product(s) (knockdown of multiple
 gene products is encouraged but not required); and (b) evaluate
appropriate correlative endpoints \/ phenotypic effects (e.g., cell
death, cell cycle arrest, cell differentiation) Establish specificity of
 the RNAi therapeutic and its phenotypic effects using appropriate
controls (e.g., mutational substitution, cDNA rescue, scrambled RNAi
sequences)\n\u2022 Perform a small in vivo efficacy study in a relevant
animal model of cancer: (a) quantitate knockdown of the target gene
transcript (i.e., at least one gene) and demonstrate a \u226570%
reduction in the corresponding protein product; (b) evaluate appropriate
 correlative endpoints \/ phenotypic effects\nPhase II Activities and

        "topic_name": "Development of Human Tissue Culture Systems that
Mimic the Tumor Microenvironment",
        "description": "There is a critical need to improve the accuracy
 of preclinical drug efficacy screening and testing through the
development of in vitro culture systems that more effectively mimic the
in vivo environment. Currently, two-dimensional (2D) in vitro culture
systems or in vivo animal models are the primary tools used to test
cancer cell responses to drugs. However, drug sensitivity data obtained
via 2D culture systems can be misrepresentative, while animal models are
 expensive, time-consuming, and not always predictive of the effects on
human tumors in their native environment. Three-dimensional (3D) culture
 systems that mimic the tumor microenvironment using human tissue could
be a better tool for drug screening by providing a more accurate, in
vivo-like structure and organization than 2D culture systems, without
the cost and time associated with using animal models. In addition,
culture systems using human tissue may produce responses more predictive
 of humans than animal models. Advances in bioengineering and 3D cell
culture models have led to in vitro systems that better replicate the
structure, physiology, and function of tissues seen in vivo. 3D models
more accurately mimic the in vivo milieu than current 2D in vitro
culture systems by recreating the morphology and arrangement of
individual cells, concentration gradients of signaling molecules and
therapeutic agents, and the composition, structure, and mechanical
forces of extracellular matrix around cells. The use of 3D systems that
recreate the human tumor microenvironment could improve drug development
 in at least two ways: 1) speed decision-making for whether a particular
 therapeutic agent is worth pursuing in an animal model, reducing the
time and cost of development; 2) lead to fewer clinical trial failures
because of earlier, more relevant results from human tissue.\nProperly
representing the tumor microenvironment is particularly critical for
testing the effectiveness of anti-cancer therapeutic agents. For
example, extravascular transport in solid tumors is a fundamental
determinant of the efficacy of both locally and systemically
administered cancer agents. Large diffusion distances in tumor tissues,
elevated interstitial fluid pressure, and interactions between
anti-cancer drugs, tumor tissue, and normal tissue are factors that
significantly limit drug diffusion in the extravascular compartment.
Additionally, due to rapid proliferation and poor blood supply to tumor
cells, the tumor microenvironment is often acidic and hypoxic, which can
 lead to the resistance of tumor cells to both drug and radiation
therapy. Thus, systems to properly recreate the tumor microenvironment
are essential to advance the discovery and development of effective
anti-cancer agents.\nProject Goals\nThe focus of this topic is the
development of 3D human tissue model culture systems that accurately
mimic the tumor microenvironment, including factors affecting tumor cell
 responses such as vascularization and interactions with heterogeneous
cell types. The project goal is to produce a system that is validated
against known effective anti-cancer agents to demonstrate the
system\u2019s utility as a predictive tool and screening assay. It is
anticipated that the development of 3D systems representative of human
tumor microenvironments will lead to an increase in the quality of and
reduction in the timelines and costs associated with screening drugs,
and enhancement in efficacy information for regulatory
decisions.\nEssential characteristics of an in vitro tumor microsystem
should include all or some of the following features: 1) multicellular
architecture that represents physiologically relevant characteristics of
 the tumor and tissue of origin; 2) reproducible and viable operation
with simple and clear protocols; 3) ability to examine multiple aspects
of cancer, such as tumor growth, angiogenesis, cell proliferation,
migration, and\/or invasion; and 4) compatibility with high content
screening platforms that include multiple molecular read-outs, such as
genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, or epigenomic analyses. System
development should permit scale-up production such that the system can
be reliably reproduced at a cost with reasonable expectation for market
success. An eventual goal for such systems may include the ability to
incorporate individual patient tumor biopsies to test patient-specific
responses to available agents.\nIt is important to note that full 3D
tumor microenvironment systems will consist of more than just an
extracellular matrix containing tumor cells and will facilitate the
inclusion of various cell types to mimic tumor cell interaction with
surrounding normal cells and their effects on cancer aggressiveness and
response to anti-cancer drugs. Examples include stromal cells that can
induce chemoresistance and encourage metastasis, as well as endothelial
cells that can carry therapeutics to the cancer. This topic is not
intended to fund microphysiological organ systems for the study of
toxicity, though tumor culture systems developed under this topic may be
 combined as a module with systems such as those being developed through
 the collaborative program between NIH, FDA, and DARPA:

        "topic_name": "Development of Companion Diagnostics: Enabling
Precision Medicine in Cancer Therapy",
        "description": "The demand for companion diagnostics has greatly
 increased with the recognition that matching the right patient to the
right drug at the right time can improve patient care and may decrease
health care costs. More than a dozen companion diagnostic tests have
been approved by the FDA to guide the prescription of products in
oncology, cardiovascular disease, and infectious disease. Among them,
tests of the Philadelphia chromosome, tumor-associated EGFR
overexpression, and HER2 protein overexpression have been identified by
the FDA as \u201crequired\u201d for the identification of candidate
cancer patients to receive Gleevec, Erbitux (cetuximab), and Herceptin
(trastuzumab), respectively, for certain indications. In 2011, the FDA
approved two pairs of new oncology drugs and their companion diagnostic
tests simultaneously. These decisions suggest that the era of companion
diagnostics has arrived.\nDespite initial success, many therapies in the
 cancer arena (both primary and adjuvant treatments) still lack
prediction and guidance from companion diagnostics. Many patients die
from recurrence and metastasis as a result of unpredicted resistance to
drugs or radiation developed during therapy, or due to pre-existing
tumor insensitivity to the drugs or radiation therapy. Guidance towards
effective and safe therapy is greatly needed and can be provided by
companion diagnostics, which include tests developed after a drug has
come to market, tests developed in conjunction with the development of a
 therapeutic agent, and tests to predict the interaction of novel agents
 with existing standard of care therapies, such as radiation or
cytotoxic chemotherapy. This topic seeks to stimulate research,
development, and commercialization of innovative tests and technology
platforms for all types of companion diagnostic applications. Companies
with advanced biomarkers are particularly encouraged to apply.\nProject
Goals\nThe goal of this contract topic is to develop companion
diagnostic assays that identify patients for which a particular
therapeutic regimen, including radiation therapy, existing drugs, and
drugs in clinical development will be safe and effective.\nTests for
monitoring the response to treatment for the purpose of adjusting
treatment (e.g., schedule, dose, discontinuation) to achieve improved
safety or effectiveness are also acceptable under this contract topic.
Though the examples mentioned above are for targeted therapies, tests
may also encompass therapeutics outside of this class. These tests
include, but are not limited to, tumor RNA\/protein expression or
overexpression, gene mutation or deletion\/insertion, allelic variation,
 and enzymatic deficiency. Noninvasive and minimally invasive sampling
methods (e.g., body fluids and mouth swab) are preferred. Other sampling
 methods are also acceptable if they provide significantly improved
predictive value, accuracy, and clinical applicability.\nThis topic is
not intended to support the development of assays that do not provide
predictive\/prognostic information for a therapy. For example, the
development of an assay for the sole purpose of measuring whether the
drug hits its intended target (e.g., pharmacodynamic assay) would not be
 considered responsive under this contract topic. A novel test\/device
providing information that is useful in cancer diagnostics or
prognostics, but not a determining factor for the safe and effective use
 of a therapeutic product, would also not be considered
responsive.\nPhase I Activities and Expected Deliverables\n\u2022
Develop a working companion diagnostic test that meets the criteria
described above\n\u2022 Characterize the variation, reproducibility, and
 accuracy of the test, and implement a QA\/QC plan\n\u2022 Demonstrate
the suitability of the test for use in the clinic, and conduct
benchmarking studies against current tests (if available);algorithms
must be tested with datasets other than those used for their
development\n\u2022 In cases where the drug for which the companion
diagnostic test being developed is not yet commercially available (i.e.,
 approved for marketing), the applicant must provide proof of
collaboration or partnership with the entity that is developing the
therapeutic agent or with an established diagnostic company\n\u2022 All
offerors must establish a collaboration or partnership with a diagnostic
 and\/or pharmaceutical company and\/or clinical\/research institution
that can provide relevant clinical trial specimens; offerors must

        "topic_name": "Development of CTC Isolation Technologies
Enabling Downstream Single Cell Molecular Analysis",
        "description": "Summary\nCirculating tumor cells (CTCs) are
cancer cells shed from either the primary tumor or its metastases and
are circulating in the peripheral blood. While metastases are directly
responsible for the majority of cancer deaths, CTCs may constitute seeds
 for metastases and may be instrumental for the spread of the disease.
Many studies have shown that the presence of CTCs in peripheral blood or
 bone marrow is of prognostic significance in different types of solid
tumors, and that the number and molecular changes of CTCs may help
predict or monitor response to treatment. An increasing number of
studies have shown large molecular and cellular heterogeneity of CTCs
from the same types of cancer and even from CTCs from the same patient.
This phenomenon has made the interpretation of cancer status very
difficult. Current FDA-approved CTC analysis is based on immunological
capture of CTCs by magnetic beads. This method does not capture all
types of CTCs, and the recovery of the captured cells for subsequent
molecular or cellular analysis is limited; hence, it is important to
develop improved methodologies for CTC isolation that enable subsequent
genomic, proteomic, or metabolomic analysis at the single cell level in
order to understand the origin and role of these subpopulations of CTCs
in cancer progression and treatment response. Enabling CTC analysis at
the single-cell level will significantly contribute to cancer research
and the selection of treatment options for patients based on changes in
CTC numbers and molecular characteristics before and during
treatment.\nProject Goals\nThe long-term goal of the project is to
integrate new or established technologies to enable molecular
characterization and analysis of individual CTCs isolated from blood or
bone marrow. An ideal system will be a modular platform combining a CTC
capture and separation module with several other modules for downstream
molecular analysis such as genomic, metabolomic, proteomic and mutation
analysis at the individual cell level. Non-modular systems will also be
acceptable. The short-term goal is to demonstrate the technical
viability of the proposed technology to isolate and analyze CTCs at the
single-cell level in an experimental setting. If molecular analysis is
not performed with the proposed device, a detailed description about
compatible downstream analysis technology(\/ies), including
manufacturers and model numbers, is required.\nAcceptable studies
include but are not limited to:\n\u2022 CTC isolation and enrichment
technologies such as magnetic separation, microfluidics, size
separation, and negative or positive selection\n\u2022 Integrated CTC
devices which combine CTC capture and molecular analysis \u2022 Viable
CTC cell isolation and\/or culturing for treatment assessment\n\u2022
Low-cost multichannel scanning, imaging, flow cytometry, spectral
analysis or equivalent technologies for CTC molecular analysis with the
potential to combine with innovative single-cell isolation (e.g. micro
dissection)\n\u2022 Non-separation-based technologies for CTCs that
enable molecular analysis\nPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables\n\u2022 Develop a method for CTC isolation or
identification amenable to downstream single-cell analysis\n\u2022 The
technology\/device should be able to isolate or identify CTCs from
samples with CTC counts as low as one cell\/ml of blood (for Phase I,
seeding experiments are acceptable)\n\u2022 The technology\/device
should be able to perform single-cell molecular analysis (or whole
genome amplification) for more than 100 CTCs, or isolate more than 100
CTCs individually in a format and volume that is compatible with
existing downstream single-cell molecular analysis\no In the latter
case, please specify the format, volume, and intended downstream
analysis\n\u2022 Characterize the variation, reproducibility, and
accuracy of the method; the method must demonstrate at least 80%
recovery and 70% purity\n\u2022 When applicable (e.g., when downstream
analysis is gene expression), determine the viability of CTCs\n\u2022
Demonstrate feasibility that the device (including imaging, spectral
analysis or equivalent technologies) can provide CTCs for molecular
analysis at the single-cell level, and at least 10 biomarkers (including
 markers to confirm that the isolated cells are CTCs) can be measured
(preferably simultaneously) for the same cell\n\u2022 Implement a QA\/QC
 plan\n\u2022 The establishment of a collaboration or partnership with
established diagnostic or pharmaceutical companies is strongly
encouraged\n\u2022 Provide the NCI with SOPs, including sample
collection, shipping, storage conditions, consumables used, and
molecular analysis, for evaluation\n\u2022 Provide the NCI detailed
design specifications (including components) and estimations of the cost
 of producing the proposed devices and\/or reagents, including an
analysis\/breakdown of vendors and\/or sources of raw materials\nPhase
II Activities and Expected Deliverables\n\u2022 Develop a prototype of
the device incorporating the technology demonstrated in Phase I with at
least two of the applications below or other applications with
significant clinical utility:\no Single CTC whole genome sequencing\no
Single CTC molecular phenotyping\no Single CTC proteomic analysis\no

analysis\no Single CTC targeted multiplex epigenetic analysis o Culture
of individual CTCs with sufficient percent of viable cells for ex vivo
analysis (e.g. drug treatment)\n\u2022 Test the device with a sufficient

        "topic_name": "Wound Healing Preparations Incorporating Nitric
Oxide-Releasing Materials (NIH Technology Transfer)",
        "description": "Summary\nNon-healing wounds can pose significant
 problems for cancer patients (e.g., in cases where multiple operations
are required for local recurrence, when large wounds are slow to close,
and especially when patients receive radiation at sites requiring
surgery). In addition, the effects of chemotherapy, nutritional deficits
 along with co-morbidities (e.g., diabetes), and infections can
complicate wound healing. Therefore, the cancer patient population has
the potential for non-healing wounds due to the nature and effects of
the oncologic disease process and its treatments
(http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2206003\/). Improved
methods are thus needed for treating non-healing wounds that often
result in lengthy hospital stays, application of multiple types of
dressings and ointments, and hyperbaric methods.\nNitric oxide (NO) is
an important bio-signaling molecule whose role has been extensively
recognized in the body\u2019s endogenous immune, inflammatory, and
tissue regenerative responses. Therapeutic application of exogenous
topical NO-generating agents has been shown to provide powerful,
broad-spectrum antimicrobial action, and NO is capable of providing
numerous wound-healing benefits if delivered at the proper
concentrations. However, since NO is an easily oxidized gas, controlled
topical delivery of NO to a desired area is difficult. The National
Cancer Institute (NCI) has developed a family of polymers based on
poly(acrylonitrile) that are capable of storing NO bound in a stable
chemical functionality, called a diazeniumdiolate group, and releasing
NO under aqueous conditions. The next logical step in the utilization of
 these materials for biomedical applications is the incorporation of
these NO-releasing poly(acrylonitrile)-based compositions into suitable,
 biocompatible dressings for application to wounds to fight infection,
modulate inflammation, and promote angiogenesis and collagen synthesis
in order to accelerate wound closure and\/or otherwise improve
functional outcomes.\nThis invention is the subject of issued patents US
 7,968,664 and US 8,093,343, and HHS Reference Number
E-188-2004.\nProject Goals\nThe ultimate goal of this effort is to
develop a commercially viable wound-healing dressing, utilizing this
NCI-developed technology, to alleviate the suffering and costs caused by
 non-healing wounds, thereby establishing a precedent for supportive
care for cancer while quickly creating a product of merit. The
short-term goal of this project is to develop a prototype of such a
dressing and to provide data that clearly demonstrate the potential of
this stable NO-releasing material\/formulation. The work scope may
include design and fabrication of the material with in vitro evaluation
(e.g., product stability testing) and preliminary in vivo assessment of
its efficacy and final prototype development. These data will support
the continued development of the experimental medical device to the
point of filing an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). The long-term
 goal of this topic is to enable a small business to bring a fully
developed product incorporating NCI\u2019s NO-releasing polymer
technology to the clinic and the market.\nThe dressing to be developed
under this contract should demonstrate the ability to maintain the
stability of the diazeniumdiolate group during storage and
sterilization, and to release NO when triggered by any mechanism related
 to wound contact (e.g., thermal or aqueous stimuli, biochemical
interaction, etc.), or triggered by the health care provider (e.g.,
light source, chemical mixing, etc.). Since one of the major potential
benefits of sustained and controlled release of therapeutic NO is the
reduced frequency with which the care provider must contact the wounded
skin to apply therapeutics and change the dressing, any stable,
NO-releasing formulation will be considered including, but not limited
to, fabric-based \u201ctraditional\u201d dressings incorporating
poly(acrylonitrile) as one of the textile components, hydrogels, creams,
 gels, nanomaterials, meshes, films, coatings, etc.\nThis is an NIH TT

        "topic_name": "Test to Predict Effectiveness of Docetaxel
Treatment for Prostate Cancer (NIH Technology Transfer)",
        "description": "Summary\nOver the past two years, medical
oncologists have added three new therapies to the therapeutic arsenal
against Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC): abiraterone,
Sipleucel-T, and cabazitaxel. Before approval of these agents, docetaxel
 was the only life-extending therapeutic option for men with CRPC, and
docetaxel remains the standard of care for men who can tolerate
chemotherapy. Moreover, there are several promising agents that are
likely to be FDA-approved for CRPC in coming years (i.e., MDV-3100,
EPI-001, and TOK-001). Therefore, the commercial availability of a
method to determine which CRPC patients will have a superior response to
 docetaxel therapy (and which CRPC patients will not respond), will
allow medical oncologists to consider other approved options in certain
patients, thereby \u201cpersonalizing\u201d CRPC therapy. The National
Cancer Institute (NCI) has developed a genotype test that can indicate
the duration of survival following docetaxel therapy in men with CRPC.
The test detects a genetic variant in cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1*3;
4326C&gt;G) that encodes a leucine-to-valine amino acid substitution,
L432V, in the translated protein. This genetic polymorphism causes P450
1B1 *3 to synthesize higher than normal concentrations of a reactive
estrogen species (e.g., estradiol-3,4-quinone [E2-3,4Q]) that reduces
docetaxel activity via two distinct mechanisms. Firstly, E2-3,4Q binds
directly to docetaxel at biological pH, thereby reducing docetaxel
potency. Secondly, E2-3,4Q antagonizes the mechanism of action of
docetaxel (i.e., microtubule stabilization), by destabilizing the
interaction between tubulin thiol groups that are required to form
microtubules. Therefore, a simple genotypic test can determine whether
or not a patient will respond to docetaxel, or whether treatment with
other newly-approved anticancer agents is warranted. The genetic marker
CYP1B1*3 could be used as a prognostic tool to predict survival rate and
 propensity to respond to docetaxel treatment.\nThis invention is the
subject of filed patent applications US20100280084A1 and EP1943358, and
HHS Reference Number E-307-2005\/0.\nProject Goals\nThe focus of this
topic is to advance development of this genetic test which would provide
 rapid and useful a priori predictions of the clinical outcome of
docetaxel patients and guide the therapeutic strategy for each patient.
The short-term goals of this project are to: (i) develop a rapid and
reproducible assay for the CYP1B1*3 variant; (ii) provide additional
preclinical evidence necessary for carrying the CYP1B1*3 genotype test
into the clinical setting; and (iii) determine if cabazitaxel activity
is related to the CYP1B1*3 allele and reactive estrogen species. The
long-term goal of this project is obtain FDA approval for the test, to
establish broader utility for the CYP1B1*3 test in treatment of other
cancer types, implement the test in conjunction with alternate
therapeutics that act via modulation of this estrogen responsive
pathway, and to further translate the utility of the genotype test to
wider clinical use. This technology, once demonstrated in the field of
prostate cancer, could be applied to breast and lung cancer genetic
markers that have clinical application in defining the chemotherapeutic
treatment schedules for individual patients.\nPhase I deliverables
include technique development, further demonstration of the mechanism of
 CYP1B1*3 interference, validation that genotype is related to survival
using retrospective CRPC patient samples, and identification of the
percentage of samples with the variant. A future Phase II SBIR award
would include a genotype-directed prospective clinical trial with
docetaxel and\/or cabazitaxel to demonstrate improved taxane outcomes in
 genotyped patients.\nThis is an NIH TT (Technology Transfer) contract

        "topic_name": "Technology to Generate Anti-Peptide Capture
Reagents for Affinity-Enriched Proteomic Studies",
        "description": "Summary\nAnti-peptide capture reagents can be
used to identify and quantify proteins containing a target peptide
sequence with a number of applications in biological research and
bioassay development. For instance, they are used routinely in
techniques such as immunoprecipitation, Western blot, and
immunohistological identification and protein localization. A
recently-developed application of such reagents is Stable Isotope
Standards and Capture by Anti-Peptide Antibodies (SISCAPA), which
utilizes antibodies to enrich peptides from complex matrices for
quantitation of proteins by stable isotope dilution mass spectrometry.
SISCAPA has the potential for simultaneous quantification of multiple
targets from a given sample. There is growing interest in the
development of such multiplex protein assays, including large-scale
biomarker candidate verification studies and analyses of targeted
biological pathways. Concurrent quantification of multiple protein
analytes is highly desirable in these applications to minimize sample
requirements, handling, and assay costs per analyte, while maximizing
throughput.\nProject Goals\nThe goal of this project is to develop new
technologies that generate reproducible, well-characterized anti-peptide
 capture reagents for use in affinity-enriched proteomic studies for the
 cancer research community. An important characteristic of the desired
reagents is the ability to immunoprecipitate their target peptide with
high affinity. These reagents should be comparable or superior to
ELISA-based antibody technologies in terms of specificity, affinity, and
 sensitivity and be reproducibly generated in a cost-effective and
efficient (e.g. renewable) manner. Currently, mice are often used to
generate monoclonal antibodies or alternative capture reagents, but
peptides do not always elicit a potent immune response, which can result
 in low yield of antibodies to effectively immunoprecipitate the target
peptides. The desired technology will likely be one that produces a
strong immune response to peptide antigens, and may include the use of
species other than mice for the generation of antibodies, since other
species may have more diverse epitope recognition and improved immune
response to small-size epitopes.\nThe development of these affinity
capture reagents will be done in coordination with NCI's Clinical
Proteomic Technologies for Cancer (CPTC)
(http:\/\/proteomics.cancer.gov). A list of proteins or proteotypic
peptides derived from cancer biomarker candidates may be requested from
CPTC. Furthermore, these capture reagents must be made available as a
resource to the scientific community. The suggested choices of
performance platforms that the affinity reagents must be compared to
include mass spectrometry-based quantitative assays,
immunoprecipitation, ELISA-based assays, Western blot, and
immunohistochemistry. In addition, other considerations should include
sensitivity\/specificity\/affinity information for the reagents, and
method comparison with gold standard practices, precision, and
LOD\/LOQ.\nPhase I Activities and Expected Deliverables\n\u2022 Develop
proof-of-concept strategies and\/or technologies that reliably generate
anti-peptide capture reagents that can immunoprecipitate the target
peptides; this includes, but is not limited to, strategies\/technologies
 that can produce stronger immune responses to peptide antigens than
current technologies\n\u2022 Demonstrate that the capture reagents
developed through this technology can repeatedly and reproducibly
immunoprecipitate the target peptides\n\u2022 Work with the Clinical
Proteomic Technologies for Cancer (CPTC) community
(http:\/\/proteomics.cancer.gov), private and public sector to identify
appropriate minimum characterization criteria for validation of the
assays\n\u2022 In coordination with CPTC program staff, select and
generate affinity reagents to at least ten proteotypic peptides and
demonstrate high affinity (Kd of10-9 M or better), specificity and
immunoprecipitation performance\n\u2022 If requested, be prepared to
make available to NCI sufficient reagents to perform 10 test runs for
each of the ten peptides for independent evaluation \u2022 Present
findings to an NCI CPTC Evaluation Panel and demonstrate any additional
characteristics (e.g. capture of corresponding full-length protein) and
how the capture reagents have improved cost effectiveness and throughput
 capabilities in production and method feasibility of screening of large

Metabolomics Research",
        "description": "Summary\nThe metabolome is a measure of the
output of biological pathways and, as such, is often considered more
representative of the functional state of a cell than other \u2018omics
measures such as genomics or proteomics. In addition, metabolites are
conserved across various animal species, facilitating the extrapolation
of research findings in laboratory animals to humans. Despite early
promise, challenges remain before the full potential of metabolomics can
 be realized \u2013 including the limited availability of high quality
metabolite standards and of companies\/core facilities that provide
metabolomics services. The NIH Common Fund is currently developing a
multi-component program to help increase metabolomics research capacity.
 SBIR contracts that focus on identifying and synthesizing reliable
metabolite standards will complement this effort by attracting current
and emerging small businesses to develop these much needed tools \u2013
which in turn will contribute towards achieving an important NIH Common
Fund goal of increasing the repertoire of high quality and authentic
standards for identification, characterization and quantization of
metabolites. Entities that wish to compete for such contracts must be
cognizant of the current cost and intellectual property rights
challenges that have restricted the use of said tools in basic,
pre-clinical, and translational research alike and consequently make
reasonable efforts to make said standards and corresponding product
sheets widely accessible to the metabolomics community at
large.\nProject Goals\nThe short and long-term project goals involve the
 development of both isotopically labeled (i.e., 15N, 13C or 2H) and
unlabeled metabolite standards for use with mass spectrometry (MS)
and\/or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), respectively.
Compounds need to be synthesized in GLP labs with ISO 9000
certification, and purified by either chromatographic methods or
crystallization to &gt;95% purity.  Classes of metabolites that require
standards for metabolite identification include, but are not limited
to:\n1. Glycolytic and other energy intermediates\n2. Amino acid
metabolism\n3. Lipids (phospholipids, glycerolipids, sphingolipids,
glycolipids, oxylipins)\n4. Acylcarnitines and acylglycines\n5.
Secondary drug metabolites\n6. Secondary food metabolites\n7. Fatty
acids\nOfferors should focus their proposals on developing at least one
set of metabolite standards, where all compounds in the set are linked
to one cancer-related metabolic pathway\nPhase I Activities and Expected
 Deliverables\n\u2022 Synthesize, as appropriate for any given metabolic
 pathway, a range of 10-1000 labeled or unlabeled compounds under GLP
conditions on a pilot scale sufficient to run at least 10 MS or NMR
analyses\n\u2022 Verify structures of the synthesized compounds\n\u2022
Purify compounds using either chromatographic methods or crystallization
 to &gt;95% purity\n\u2022 Investigate formulation issues and whether
the compounds in the metabolite standards set can stably be packaged
together versus separately\n\u2022 Run pilot MS or NMR validation tests
of the metabolite standards set to evaluate its performance\nPhase II
Activities and Expected Deliverables\n\u2022 Scale up of synthesis,
purification, and formulation\/packaging\/chemical stability of Phase I
deliverables to allow for more extensive product validation.\n\u2022
Validate the metabolite standards set for reproducible performance in MS
 or NMR as appropriate.\n\u2022 Provide letters of interest from
potential customers, and later letters of commitment from customers to
purchase the product developed under this contract. ",

        "topic_name": "Chemically Defined Glycan Libraries for Reference
 Standards and Glycomics Research (Joint NCI-NIGMS Program)",
        "description": "Summary\nGlycans play important roles in cell
recognition, motility, signaling processes, cell differentiation, cell
adhesion, microbial pathogenesis, and immune recognition.
Carbohydrate-based high throughput assays (e.g. glycan microarrays,
nanoparticles) hold great promise for the rapid analysis of carbohydrate
 binding proteins (CBPs), elucidation of CBP biology, and the
development of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics for a number of
diseases, including cancer. However, the utility of these high
throughput assays is limited by the paucity of robust biologically
relevant glycan libraries available for screening. Glycan standards are
also needed to perform structural analysis, especially for monitoring
changes in glycosylation that can significantly affect protein function
and the safety and efficacy of bio-therapeutics.\nNCI participates in
trans-NIH initiatives to further glycomics research as part of the
Alliance of Glycobiologists for Detection of Cancer, which partners with
 NCI\u2019s Early Detection Research Network, as well as the Glycomics
and Glycotechnology Biomedical Technology Research Centers and the
Consortium for Functional Glycomics which are funded by NIGMS. Small
businesses that develop new glycan libraries for defining the
specificities of CBPs, probing the immune response, screening for
cancer-associated glycan biomarkers, and enabling glycan structural
analysis will more rapidly advance the field of glycomics.\nContract
offerors must be cognizant of the current cost and intellectual property
 rights challenges that have restricted the use of chemical libraries in
 basic, preclinical, and translational research, and be willing to abide
 by NIH policies pertaining to the sharing and dissemination of unique
research resources developed with NIH funding. Abiding by the NIH
Principles and Guidelines for Recipients of NIH Research Grants and
Contracts on Obtaining and Disseminating Biomedical Research Resources
will ensure that libraries and data generated from them will be
deposited into existing repositories and databases that will serve as
resources for the entire glycobiology community for non-commercial
research purposes.\nProject Goals\nThe goals of this program are to
support the synthesis and commercial distribution of robust,
well-characterized new carbohydrate libraries that are amenable to being
 functionalized\/linkered for use in high throughput assays, are useful
as standards in mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) applications, and can be used to expand existing screening
platforms, structural assays, and additional tool development. These
libraries would need to be made with appropriate quality control
documentation, and at reasonable cost.\nThe Expanding the Chemical Space
 for Carbohydrates: Roadmap to Automated Synthesis workshop report,
presented to the NIGMS National Advisory Council in 2011, highlights the
 critical need for comprehensive chemically-defined glycan libraries
for: development of screening platforms with sufficient numbers of
structures and diversity to cover the major sectors of mammalian
glycomes, use as analytical standards, use as substrates for enzymology,
 and use as building blocks to increase the glycan chemical space with
newly identified enzymes. For analytical standards, biologically
relevant groups of related structures with emphasis on isomers will be
most useful. Compound collections that provide a basis for development
of MS or NMR-based experimental conditions for differentiation of
closely related structures are highly desirable. Based on current
literature, a 10k-12k glycan collection is needed to represent the
functional human glycome, and populate a comprehensive glycan array in a
 manner that would significantly move the field of glycomics forward.
Presently, estimates suggest that only 1000 or so glycans have been
synthesized for research purposes, and of these, only a few hundred are
commercially available.\nA number of NIH institutes (NIGMS, NCI, NIAID,
NHLBI) support specific efforts in glycomics and several others (NIDDK,
NIDCR, NICHD, NIAMS) also have interests in glycobiology. Discovery labs
 in The Alliance of Glycobiologists for Detection of Cancer
(http:\/\/glycomics.cancer.gov), supported by NCI have a current need
for libraries of glycans to facilitate structural studies and
high-throughput analysis of carbohydrates derived from biological
sources. SBIR contracts focused on synthesis of chemically defined
glycan libraries that represent important subsets of the human glycome
including representative N- and O- linked glycan libraries, glycan
structures found on glycosphingolipids, and libraries of
glycosaminoglycan oligomers, would speed progress towards a
comprehensive mammalian glycan library. Ready access to these reagents
is expected to speed progress in the emerging field of glycomics.
Compounds must be synthesized and purified utilizing best practices to
&gt;98% purity as established by NMR.\nIt is recommended that offerors
focus their proposals on developing at least one robust glycan library
of significant complexity. Libraries of free, reducing-end glycans
required include, but are not limited to:\nHybrid-type and complex
N-glycan core structures with various multiples of antennae\n\u2022
Hybrid-type N-glycans with all combinations of mannose cores \u2022
Complex-type N-glycans with basic structures of bi-, tri-
tetra-antennary, and bisected versions of those, terminating in either
sialic acid, galactose, or N-acetylglucosamine. Further elaboration of
antennae might include lactosamine extensions, fucosylation, or
sulfation. Variability of these features in the antennae is also
required to distinguish topological isomers.\n\u2022 High mannose-type
glycans and isomers.\nO-glycans\n\u2022 O-glycan Cores 1 and 2, as well
as O-glycans bearing fucosylated and sialylated lactosamines of various
lengths and degrees of internal fucosylation.\nHuman Blood Group

antigens (ABO(H) and their variations - A1, A2, H-type 1, H-type 2,
H-type 3, H-type 4, etc.).\n\u2022 Lewis blood group (human
fucose-containing) antigens (sLex, Lex , Lea, sLea, repeating Lex, etc.,
 on glycolipid, N- and O-glycan backbones, etc.).\nGlycosphingolipid
head groups\n\u2022 Ganglioside-, globoside-, lactosamine-, and
neo-lactosamine-based core structures\nPhosphorylated mannose
glycans\n\u2022 P-Man-R and GlcNAc-P-Man-R\nGlycosaminoglycans
(GAGs)\n\u2022 Glycosaminoglycan fragments (especially heparan sulfate
oligosaccharides) of 4 to 8 saccharides with\/without defined
sulfation.\nGlycopeptides\n\u2022 O-linked core structures on building
blocks (such as Fmoc, Ser, or Thr) that can be utilized in peptide
synthesis.\nPhase I Activities and Expected Deliverables\n\u2022

compounds) representative of a sector(s) of the mammalian glycome that
is not presently commercially available, under GLP conditions on a pilot
 scale (~ 200 \u03bcg\/compound)\n\u2022 Purify these compounds using
best practices to &gt;98% purity\n\u2022 Verify structures of the

        "topic_name": "Real-Time Integration of Sensor and Self-Report
Data for Clinical and Research Applications",
        "description": "Summary\nWireless sensors, and mobile devices
and applications are increasingly marketed for health monitoring or
interventions in consumer and clinical settings for prevention or
management of chronic disease. A rapidly expanding market segment of
technologies are focused on objective measures of health related
behaviors (e.g., physical activity, sleep, diet, medication adherence,
etc.). These mobile health technologies offer the capability to collect
tremendous volumes of high quality health data, with continuous
monitoring or event recording functions, in near real time. The
expanding use of behavioral monitoring technologies, applications and
mobile messaging provides new opportunities within consumer health,
clinical care, and research. However, meaningful interpretation of the
high volume of data generated from monitoring technologies is a
challenge for the patient, care team and the researcher. Further, health
 monitoring technologies are often criticized for lacking additional
contextual data to facilitate their interpretation.\nAdded to data from
sensors and monitoring technology, self-reported measures can provide
invaluable psychosocial, contextual, and environmental health-related
information. Patient-reported outcomes in physical, mental or social
health domains include physical abilities, fatigue, pain, depression,
and social interactions. The expanded use of smartphone technologies
lends itself to private, convenient, real-time data collection of
self-reported measures. However, development or optimization of
cross-platform mobile applications and scalable, efficient, cloud-based
server platforms for rapid and real-time self-reporting and monitoring
of these measures is needed.\nReal-time integration of objective and
patient-reported data could improve understanding and clinical
management of acute and time-varying symptoms such as fatigue, pain, or
depression experienced by cancer and other chronic disease patients. The
 integrated collection of objective and self-reported data can stimulate
 innovation within clinical and research settings, including clinical
trials, clinical care, case-management, interventions, surveillance, and
 epidemiologic studies. For example, temporal integration of medication
monitoring technologies, such as smart pill cases and sensor-based
activity and sleep data, with patient-reported measures of depression,
fatigue, or pain could enhance pharmaceutical clinical trial results.
However, efficient systems and platforms for the capture, storage,
integration, visualization, and reporting of these data streams are
extremely limited or non-existent. Project Goals\nThis topic\u2019s
short-term goal is the development of innovative, secure,
privacy-compliant mobile applications and paired analytic systems to
control the collection, transfer, integration, analysis and reporting of
 objective and self-reported health-related measures. Longer term goals
include the integration of these data systems and layers in health care
and research settings to support customized monitoring and feedback
loops, alerts, or alarms for consumers, patients, or members of the
health care team.\nResponses to this topic are expected to address the
development of efficient methods and platforms to:\n1. Collect data from
 behavioral health monitoring technologies and self-reported behavioral,
 psychosocial, environmental, and contextual measures.\n2. Demonstrate
integration with various wireless sensors.\n3. Appropriately secure data
 at each stage of collection, transfer, and storage.\n4. Temporally
integrate information from multiple data sources.\n5. Visualize data
using customizable tools.\n6. Analyze and report on (patient identified
or de-identified) individual or group level data using customizable
tools and reporting systems.\n7. Maintain compliance with HIPAA,
privacy, and consent management protocols as required for platform
specific applications.\nThe resulting platform\u2019s utility extends
from consumer health to clinical care and research settings for
behavioral monitoring and prevention or management of disease. This
topic encourages development of innovative, secure, privacy compliant
mobile applications and 2-way mobile messaging techniques to facilitate
and control the collection and transport of temporal data inputs from
behavioral health monitoring technologies, self-reported measures, and
associated metadata. The data acquisition systems described above must
be paired with efficient, scalable back-end systems for data
importation, storage, integration, visualization, analyses, and output
reporting. Data elements may include (but are not limited to) wireless
physical activity or sleep sensors\/monitors, physiologic sensors,
adherence monitors, sensor-based measures of stress or fatigue, dietary
intake measures, geospatial location tags or linkages, images, text
based annotations, speech recording and recognition; and self-reports of
 behavioral, psychosocial, environmental, and contextual data.\nAn
essential task for each proposal is the development of transparent and
customizable analytic tools for temporal data integration,
visualization, and summary reporting of individual or group level
measures. Recommended short term targets for system outputs are to
provide reports to patients\/participants, clinicians\/researchers, and
health systems; with longer term targets to provide reports directly to
electronic medical records and public health surveillance systems.
Recommended reports are consistent with current health outcomes policy
priorities and objectives in the Meaningful Use Matrix for electronic
health records established by the Health Information Technology Policy
Committee (see http:\/\/healthit.hhs.gov\/portal\/server.pt).\nPhase I

        "topic_name": "Development of Radiation Modulators for Use
During Radiotherapy",
        "description": "Summary\nRadiotherapy is employed in the
treatment of over half of all cancer patients. Many of those patients
suffer adverse effects during and\/or after treatment. Additionally,
tumors recur in approximately half the patients treated with curative
intent. Enhancing specific tumor killing and minimizing normal tissue
damage from radiotherapy would improve tumor control and patient quality
 of life. An ideal intervention would both enhance radiation effects in
tumors and protect the normal tissues.\nRadiosensitizers are agents that
 are intended to enhance tumor cell killing while having a minimal
effect on normal tissues. Recently, two new radiation sensitization
drugs have proven clinically effective: Temozolomide treatment with
radiotherapy for glioblastoma and Cetuximab treatment combined with
radiation for head and neck squamous cell cancers. There is significant
potential for further development of novel radiosensitizing
agents.\nConventionally, radioprotectors are defined as agents given
before radiation exposure to prevent or reduce damage to normal tissues,
 while mitigators refer to those agents given during or after a
patient\u2019s prescribed course of radiation therapy to prevent or
reduce imminent damage to normal tissues. Both radioprotectors and
mitigators are also being developed as potential countermeasures against
 radiological terrorism and several have shown promise in pre-clinical
testing. In order for these to be developed and useful in clinical
radiation therapy applications, it is imperative to demonstrate that
they do not protect cancer cells.\nThe importance of developing agents
that sensitize tumor cells, protect or mitigate radiation-induced damage
 in normal tissue, improve survival, quality of life, and palliative
care in cancer patients was emphasized in a recent NCI workshop on
Advanced Radiation Therapeutics - Radiation Injury Mitigation held on
January 25th 2010 (Movsas B, et al. Decreasing the adverse effects of
cancer therapy: National Cancer Institute guidance for the clinical
development of radiation injury mitigators. Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Jan
15;17(2):222-8. Epub 2010 Nov 3. PMID: 21047979), and in a workshop on
Radiation Resistance in Cancer Therapy: Its Molecular Bases and Role of
the Microenvironment on its Expression held Sept 1-3, 2010. Prior
workshops have dealt with sensitization, protection, or radiation
effects assessment (Colevas AD, et al. Radiation Modifier Working Group

radiation modifiers. J Natl Cancer Inst. 2003 May 7;95(9):646-51.

injuries. Report of an NCI Workshop, December 3-4, 2003. Radiat Res.
2004 Dec;162(6):711-28. PMID: 1554812.)\nThis contract topic encourages
the development of innovative and promising radioprotectors, mitigators,
 or sensitizers that either selectively protect normal tissues (but not
tumors) against ionizing radiation or selectively sensitize tumors,
thereby increasing the therapeutic ratio of radiation. Proposals for
radiation modulators are solicited that include preclinical and\/or
early phase clinical studies demonstrating safety, efficacy, dose,
schedule, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and metabolism.
Proposals should also demonstrate a clear understanding of regulatory
requirements, and should include a regulatory plan including key steps
such as a pre-IND meeting with FDA, submission of an investigational new
 drug (IND) application, approval of clinical trial design, and
ultimately drug registration. Project Goals\nThe goal is to stimulate
collaborations among academic institutions, small businesses, and
contract research organizations in order to promote the rapid
development of innovative radioresponse modifiers that will decrease
normal tissue injury and\/or enhance tumor killing, thereby improving
radiotherapy outcomes. The long-term goal is to enable small businesses
to fully develop, license, and\/or market radioresponse modifiers for
clinical use.\nThe contract proposal must describe:\nPhase I\n\u2022 A
quantitative estimate of the patient population that will benefit from
the availability of such radioresponse modifiers.\n\u2022 A plan for
generating evidence that the proposed compound(s) protects at least one
relevant normal tissue from radiation-induced injury, and\/or sensitizes
 at least two relevant tumor models.\n\u2022 Either:\n1. A plan for
generating evidence that the proposed radioprotector(s)\/mitigator(s)
does not significantly protect cancer cells, OR\n2. A plan for
generating evidence that the proposed radiosensitizer(s) does not
significantly sensitize normal cells and tissues.\n\u2022 The plans must
 include the methodologies proposed to evaluate the preferential effects
 on normal tissues or tumors by the compound(s) in vivo (including
appropriate biomarkers and endpoints as determined during early
interactions with the FDA).\n\u2022 Determination of the optimal dose
and schedule in vivo based upon preclinical pharmacodynamic and
pharmacokinetic studies.\n\u2022 Statistical validation of the proposed
study endpoints including where appropriate, power calculations and
rationale for proposed sample sizes.\nPhase II\n\u2022 The approach to
early-phase human trials designed to take into account relevant
molecular pathways and targets, and aim to gather pharmacodynamic and
pharmacokinetic data to confirm the compound\u2019s observed behavior in
 animal studies.\nThe approach and experiments to assess the safety and
efficacy of the compound(s) in early-phase human trials employing, as
appropriate, physician-reported endpoints as well as patient-reported
outcomes.\nDeliverables\nPhase I may include primarily preclinical
studies. Phase II or Fast-Track proposals must contain a section
entitled "Regulatory Plan" detailing plans for early involvement of the
FDA. There should be a description of how the applicant plans on meeting
 the requirements to: 1) define suitable biomarkers and endpoints, 2)
file IND and 3) design and perform phase 0-2 clinical trials in
preparation for product transition to phase 3 clinical trials by groups
such as the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
(http:\/\/www.rtog.org\/).\nWhere cooperation of other partners is
critical for implementation of the proposed methodology, the applicant
should provide evidence of such cooperation (through partnering
arrangement, letters of support, etc.).\nThe following deliverables may
be required depending on a compound\u2019s maturity in the developmental
 pipeline:  Phase I\n\u2022 Selection and approval of cell line panels
for in vitro testing\n\u2022 Demonstration of drug solubility and uptake

efficacy and specificity of radiosensitization for tumor cells\n\u2022
Preliminary evidence for lack of in vivo toxicity in normal cells or
organisms\n\u2022 Documentation providing a top-level description of the
 protocols and the testing results should be provided to NCI as part of
the Phase I progress report\nPhase II\nFor advanced pre-clinical
work:\n\u2022 Design of NCI and Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC)-approved in vivo experimentation plan including
statistical validation of experimental design, and sample size
determination including power calculations\n\u2022 Selection and
approval of tumor cell panel and normal tissues for in vitro
testing\n\u2022 Demonstration of bioavailability PK and PD in rodent
model\n\u2022 For radiation protectors\/mitigators: demonstration by
physiologic testing and histological assessment that irradiated normal
tissues are spared over a 6-month period\n\u2022 Demonstration of
effects (sensitization or lack of protection as appropriate) on tumors
using in vivo radiation regrowth delay assays\n\u2022 Collection of data
 validating lack of drug toxicity, efficacy, and specificity for normal
cells over tumor cells in the case of radiation
protectors\/mitigators\n\u2022 Documentation of the testing protocol and
 testing results should be provided to NCI as part of the Phase II
progress report for pre-clinical studies\nFor proposals advancing to
early-phase human trials:\n\u2022 Identify GMP drug source\n\u2022

 of information on cancer presence, spread, and metabolism.\nRecent
scientific advances in nanotechnology, radiochemistry, reporter gene
imaging, cancer stem cell imaging, and other fields enable the
development of novel imaging agents for:\n\u2022 Early detection and
diagnosis of cancer.\n\u2022 Differentiation of benign disease from
malignancy.\n\u2022 Stratification of patients for the purpose of
selecting a cancer therapy.\n\u2022 Surgical planning.\n\u2022
Evaluation of tumor response to chemotherapy and radiation
therapy.\n\u2022 Detection of cancer recurrence.\nDespite significant
preclinical scientific progress, very few cancer imaging agents are
available in the clinic. This SBIR contract topic seeks to stimulate the
 commercialization of novel imaging agents, including but not limited
to: nanotechnology-based imaging agents, radiopharmaceuticals for
positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed
tomography (SPECT), targeted contrast agents for X-ray, computed
tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical contrast
agents, and reporter gene imaging technologies.\nOne specific area of
interest under this topic is the development of single-domain antibody
fragments used to target radionuclides for imaging and targeted
radiotherapy of cancer. Single-domain antibody fragments are comprised
of the single variable region of naturally-occurring antibodies that
lack a light chain or engineered antibody fragments. This type of small
protein or peptide has advantages over conventional antibodies and
antibody fragments in terms of favorable and tunable clearance kinetics,
 ability to recognize hidden or uncommon epitopes, agent format
flexibility, and ease of manufacture. Therefore, developing an imaging
technology for early diagnosis of cancer at the molecular level based on
 single domain antibody fragments will be encouraged.\nProject
Goals\nThe short-term goal of this SBIR contract topic is to support
research and development activity at small businesses that are
developing cancer imaging agents. The imaging agent should be novel and,
 when appropriate, have high affinity and specificity against tumor
targets. It should also display fast in vivo clearance, rapid tumor
accumulation, sufficient in vivo stability and good biovailability, and
low immunogenicity and toxicity. The work scope may include animal
testing, formulation, GMP production, pharmacokinetic studies,
pharmacodynamic studies, and toxicological studies. These data will
support the rationale for continued development of the experimental
medical imaging agent to the point of filing an Investigational New Drug
 application (IND).\nThe long-term goal of this contract topic is to
enable small businesses to bring novel classes of fully developed cancer
 imaging agents to the clinic and the market. Therefore, businesses are
encouraged to submit applications for development of lead compounds
representing novel technology platforms.  Phase I Activities and
Expected Deliverables\nPhase I activities should generate scientific
data confirming the clinical potential of the proposed contrast agent.
The Phase I research plan must contain specific, quantifiable, and
testable feasibility milestones.\nExpected activities may
include:\n\u2022 Prepare an imaging agent that produces a high
signal-to-noise ratio\n\u2022 Demonstrate capabilities enabled by the
imaging agent\n\u2022 Quantify imaging signals to determine agent
affinity and specificity\n\u2022 Perform proof of concept pre-clinical
studies\n\u2022 Perform preliminary toxicological studies\n\u2022
Prepare a development plan that describes in detail the experiments
necessary to file an IND or an exploratory IND\n\u2022 Present Phase I
results and development plan to NCI staff\nPhase II Activities and
Expected Deliverables\nPhase II should follow the development plan laid
out in the Phase I, and should further support commercialization of
proposed cancer imaging agents. The Phase II research plan must contain
specific, quantifiable, and testable feasibility milestones.\nExpected
activities may include:\n\u2022 Complete all pre-clinical experiments
according to the development plan\n\u2022 Demonstrate fast in vivo
clearance, rapid tumor accumulation, sufficient in vivo stability, good
bioavailability, and low immunogenicity\/toxicity of the imaging
agent\n\u2022 Demonstrate high reproducibility and accuracy of the
imaging technology in several animal models\n\u2022 When appropriate,
demonstrate similar or higher specificity and sensitivity of the
technology compared to other imaging technologies\n\u2022 When
appropriate, demonstrate capabilities to monitor efficacy of drugs in
tumor cell lines and\/or animals\n\u2022 Produce sufficient amount of
clinical grade material suitable for an early clinical trial\n\u2022 If
warranted, file an IND or an exploratory IND for the candidate imaging
agent\n\u2022 Complete small-scale clinical study ",

        "topic_name": "Innovative Radiation Sources for Advanced
Radiotherapy Equipment",
        "description": "Summary\nRadiation therapy is an important tool
in the cancer treatment arsenal. Conventional radiotherapy with photons
is currently used to treat 50% of all cancer patients. The success of
radiation therapy and the risk of side effects depend heavily on the
ability to concentrate radiation in the tumor while not injuring
adjacent normal tissues. Recent developments in radiation therapy
instrumentation have increased the ability to direct radiation energy,
thereby improving the clinical utility of this treatment.\nAlthough
significant progress has been made, one of the limiting factors in the
development of novel radiotherapy approaches is the size and cost of
radiation sources. For many types of modern advanced radiotherapy, the
equipment needed to produce such radiation is bulky and extremely
expensive. At the same time, continuing advances in particle
acceleration approaches enable breakthrough innovations in this field.
An example of such advancement is the development of technologies for
charged particle acceleration using high-power lasers (laser-plasma
acceleration). New technologies enable the construction of compact,
cost-efficient external beam accelerators, and facilitate new
applications of radiotherapy. Another potential class of applications is
 the development of fiber-optics-based systems for endoscopic delivery
of gamma or electron beams. These and other technologies present key
opportunities in enabling next-generation radiation therapy
instruments.\nProject Goals\nThis contract topic seeks to stimulate
research, development, and commercialization of innovative radiation
sources that could be used to reduce the cost and footprint of radiation
 treatment systems, and thus enable novel routes for radiotherapy
delivery.\nIt is expected that the proposed innovation be driven by
clinical practice. Therefore, in addition to standard proposal
components, the contract proposal must contain specific discussion
of:\n1. Evidence of an existing clinical problem that is addressed by
the proposed radiation source\n2. Analysis of competitive methods to
address the same problem and explanation of competitive advantages of
proposed system.\nThe short-term goal of the project is to perform
proof-of-principle technical feasibility demonstration of innovative
radiation source or source components. The long-term goal of the project
 is to develop a robust, reliable radiation source and to incorporate it
 into a radiotherapy system.\nPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables\nPhase I activities should support the technical
feasibility of the innovative approach.\n\u2022 Design and build
proof-of-principle prototype system\n\u2022 Characterize beam
parameters, including energy spectra, spatial distribution, and
flux\n\u2022 Demonstrate that the prototype has a high probability of
development into a clinically-relevant radiation source in Phase II,
based on measured beam parameters\n\u2022 Provide documentation of the
prototype system design, characterization protocol, and testing results
to NCI as part of the Phase I progress report\nPhase II Activities and
Expected Deliverables\nPhase II activities should support development of
 a full-scale prototype of a radiation source with beam parameters
appropriate for the clinical application.\n\u2022 Design and develop a
prototype radiation source with parameters (e.g., beam energy, flux,
stability, etc.) that are acceptable for clinical radiation oncology
application \u2022 Demonstrate that the system is capable of delivering a
 treatment dose in a clinically acceptable period of time in an
anthropomorphic phantom\n\u2022 Provide a data sheet detailing
performance of the developed system to NCI as part of the Phase II
progress report\nWhere cooperation with other equipment manufacturers is
 critical for implementation of proposed technology, company should
provide evidence of such cooperation (through partnering arrangement,
collaboration, or letters of intent) as part of the Phase II proposal.",

Pathways of Translation",
        "description": "Translational science is very complex and can be
 characterized in a multitude of ways. Publications, grant applications,
 progress reports, funding, specific aims, study designs, hypotheses,
outcomes, scientific evidence, experts, collaborations, organizations,
and networks, as well as many other factors reflect the complex activity
 of translational and clinical research. These elements are interlinked
and often are represented by massive heterogeneous data, e.g. thousands
of papers are produced weekly. To make sense of these data and to aid in
 seeing the big picture, new methods are needed. Data visualization
techniques (e.g. maps, networks, clusters, time series) expose patterns,
 trends and correlations and are proven to be useful for extracting
information from abundant data. NCATS invites SBIR proposals that will
facilitate the introduction of visualization technology into
understanding the big picture of translational science, the evidence
behind the knowledge about human health, and interdisciplinary
communication of complex scientific information.\nMain requirements\nThe
 outcome of this contract is expected to be software that assists in
exploring multidimensional data and understanding complex concepts. The
software should:\n\u2022 visualize high-dimensional data from
potentially diverse data sources\n\u2022 enable data exploration, change
 of displayed dimensions, and semantic zooming\n\u2022 create
personalized views\n\u2022 work with complex data dimensions, utilizing

Institutes\nDeliverables\nThe deliverable of Phase I is a visualization
of a test dataset(s), which is made meaningful and valuable to NCATS
through the process of interactive learning with minimal burden on the
NCATS experts. It is envisioned that the offeror\u2019s representative
will gather initial information from publically available sources, and
then fine-tune it via observing NCATS activities and interactions with
NCATS staff to ensure that the presentation of data and analysis is
tailored to NCATS interests and facilitates actions, discussions,
feedback, and further learning.\nThe Phase II deliverable is web-enabled
 software that can be used for multidimensional data exploration and

Disorders",
        "description": "Creatine Transporter Deficiency (CTD) is a
severe x-linked linked mental retardation disorder. It is caused by
mutations in the creatine transporter gene (SLC68A). Mutations in this
gene result in an inability to move creatine across the blood brain
barrier. This inability to transport creatine across the blood brain
barrier results in a severe deficit of creatine in the CNS and this lack
 impacts energy homeostasis. Currently, diagnostic biomarkers rely on
CTD diagnosis. While there are only a few hundred patients who have been
 accurately diagnosed with this disorder it is estimated that there are
upwards of 40,000-50,000 individuals that are now labeled with x-linked
mental retardation or autism. Clinical research of potential
therapeutics will rely on the availability of a pool of patients, as
well as attempts to better understand the extent and progression of the
disease through natural history studies. This initiative seeks to
develop a biomarker for use in Creatine Transporter Defect disease. This
 biomarker would correlate to the nature of CTD and allow its use to
identify patients suitable for inclusion in clinical trials. There is
the potential that this biomarker could find utility as a diagnostic
after validation.\nMain requirements\nThe outcome of this contract is
expected to be a biomarker to monitor the effects of creatine depletion
in the CNS. This biomarker would be most useful if it could be tracked
in blood or urine but cerebral spinal fluid markers would also be
acceptable. This biomarker would have a large impact on patients if
banked tissue and blood samples could be examined as well. This
biomarker must show a difference between normal volunteer, diagnosed CTD
 patients and the difference from other autistic or cognitively impaired
 patients whose symptoms are not related to creatine transporter
deficiency. This assay should be able to be performed in reasonable
throughput.\nDeliverables Phase 1\nA biomarker assay that meets the
requirements listed above and also meets the following:\n\u2022 Develop a
 working assay\n\u2022 Characterize the variability, reproducibility and
 accuracy of the detection\n\u2022 Demonstrate the utility of the assay
by characterizing differences between normal volunteer, diagnosed CTD
patients and the difference from other autistic or cognitively impaired
patients whose symptoms are not related to creatine transporter
deficiency\n\u2022 Deliver the SOP of the working test to
NCATS\nDeliverables Phase 2\n\u2022 Demonstrate clinical utility by
testing a large number of patient samples or banked tissue or plasma
samples\n\u2022 Establish a relationship with companies developing

        "topic_name": "Automated Instrument to Clean Microtiter Plates",
        "description": "This initiative seeks to develop an automated
piece of instrumentation that can be used to clean previously used
microtiter plates, making them suitable for reuse. Given the large
quantities of microtiter plates required for high throughput screening
any such device developed has the potential of a viable commercial
market. Currently in high throughput screening the rule of thumb is to
treat every Society for Biomolecular Sciences (SBS) standard assay plate
 that gets run in a screen as a consumable that gets used only once and
is then discarded due to the risk of cross contamination. That being the
 case, the relationship of assay plates to compound plates to be
screened is a 1 to 1 association, meaning as your compound library
grows, your demand for assay plates increases, driving costs upwards.
Due to this 1 to 1 relationship, for many assays the most expensive part
 of the screen are the assay plates themselves. In addition to the cost
of the plates, these plates are typically made of non-biodegradable
plastics (polystyrene, polypropylene, etc.) that will eventually end up
in a landfill once discarded. A piece of instrumentation that could
utilize some technique to clean used assay plates would allow each plate
 to be treated as a resource instead of as a consumable, which could
greatly reduce screening costs in addition to the amount of solid waste
generated. Also, as an automated device this instrument could be used as
 part of the screening process itself, which would reduce the amount of
start up time and system real estate required for plate storage for
large scale screens. Another benefit of the instrument being automated
is it would remove the need for large scale screens to be run in
batches, since one set of assay plates could be used for the entire
screen allowing for continuous system operation.\nGiven the potential
for cost and environmental savings and the high degree of automated
instrumentation used in biological laboratory settings any instrument
developed that could allow for the reuse of microtiter plates could
potentially have a commercial market.\nProject Goals\nThe preliminary
goal of this project is to develop a functional prototype of an
instrument capable of removing both biological reagents and compounds
from a used SBS standard assay plate, specifically geared towards
biochemical assays. The final product will be an instrument, or set of
instruments, that could be integrated as a component of a high
throughput screening system in an automated fashion, capable of cleaning
 plates regardless of the number of sample wells. The long term goal of
this project is to bring this instrument to market to meet the needs of
those researchers using high quantities of assay plates, for both
biochemical and ideally cell based assays.\nPhase I Activities and

to be used within a biochemical assay with the ability to:\no Remove
over 99% of a biological reagent such as a BSA solution using different

(e.g. an absorbance assay utilizing Bradford staining solution);\no
Remove over 99% of a chemical compound such as Tannic Acid using
different assay detection modes, within the dynamic range of the assay
in question to verify wash results (e.g. a luminescence based assay
utilizing a dose response curve of Tannic Acid as a control to quantify
any residual Tannic Acid left in the sample area of the plate);\no Does
not degrade assay performance with repeated wash cycles, capable of
withstanding up to 50 wash cycles total;\no Although not a specific
requirement towards Phase I completion, there should be some ability or
plan to quantify a Sterility Assurance Level (SAL), geared towards later
 work in Phase II when some focus is given towards the ability to clean
cell based assay plates to ensure there is no contamination between
uses.\n\u2022 Cost estimates to manufacture a device capable of meeting
the specifications listed above.  \u2022 Provide NCATS with all data
resulting from Phase I Activities and Deliverables.\nPhase II Activities
 and Expected Deliverables\n\u2022 Build a prototype instrument that
meets the Phase I specifications in addition to several others geared
towards the device working as part of a larger automated process:\no Is
accessible enough to have a plate automatically loaded into the device
by standard laboratory robotic equipment;\no Has a remote programmatic
interface allowing the instrument to be controlled by an external
software application through standard laboratory communication protocols
 (RS-232, TCP\/IP, etc.);\no Can reliably operate for extended periods
of time in an automated fashion (overnight usage with a constant plate
throughput limited by the duration of the load\/unload time of the
device and the cleaning process itself).\n\u2022 Develop detailed
procedures to be able to quantify the instruments cleaning
effectiveness:\no Provide detailed protocols to show the effectiveness
of the instrument in removing biological reagents from a used assay
plate;\no Provide detailed protocols to show the effectiveness of the
instrument in removing chemical compounds from a used assay plate;\no
Develop procedures to potentially allow for the cleaning of cell based
assay plates, assuming these plates did not require any additional
coating to promote cell adhesion.\n\u2022 Demonstrate the ability of the
 prototype instrument to run the cleaning procedures as described above
in an automated fashion:\no A set of assay plates should be run for
multiple cycles and show no residual biological or chemical
contamination from previous uses;\no The assay performance should remain
 close to constant despite using the same plates repeatedly;\no The
assay performance should be comparable to using new assay plates;\no
Multiple assay detection modes should be tested as described in Phase
I.\n\u2022 Develop a robust manufacturing plan for the instrument, using

\u201ctoxicity\u201d \u2013 caused by pharmaceutical or environmental
compounds are a major cause of drug development failure and public
health concern. Methods to evaluate the potential of chemical compounds
to induce toxicity are based largely on animal testing, are
low-throughput and expensive while giving little insight into mechanisms
 of toxicity, and have not changed appreciably in the last 50 years
despite enormous advances in science. Multiple efforts, including Tox21
in the U.S., REACH in the E.U., and multiple industrial collaborations,
are attempting to develop in vitro methods to assess chemical toxicity.
These programs must assess toxicity potential in every organ system and
identify pathways and\/or targets affected. Given the protean nature of
these effects, it is likely that hundreds of in vitro assays will need
to be developed and tested for their ability to read out chemical
effects on particular cell types and pathways. Progress in the field is
currently limited by the relatively small number of pathways and cell
types that have been developed into high-throughput screening
(HTS)-ready assays, and the artificial nature of many of the assays that
 have been developed (e.g., immortalized\/transformed cell lines,
heterologous expression with lack of physiologically accurate
regulation).\nThe development of HTS-ready assays which can report on
particular pathways and cellular phenotypes across the full spectrum of

 novel assays for targets, pathways, and cellular phenotypes related to
any type of xenobiotic toxicity. These assays would utilize human cells,
 including immortalized cell lines, primary cells, and stem cell derived

novel, reflecting new pathways or cellular endpoints than are currently

Fibrosis",
        "description": "Summary\nMyocardial fibrosis is a crucial marker
 of adverse cardiac remodeling. Research suggests a strong correlation
between the extent of myocardial fibrosis and adverse myocardial
remodeling that occurs after ischemic injury or during the progression
of cardiomyopathies and heart failure. Diffuse myocardial fibrosis is
thought to provide a high-risk substrate for the development of atrial
and ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, early detection of myocardial
fibrosis might be prognostic for the development of heart failure and
increased risk of both atrial and ventricular heart rhythm disorders. In
 addition, a means to easily assess the development of myocardial
fibrosis is expected to provide a more effective way to monitor
therapeutic efficacy of interventions intended to slow or halt the
progression of these cardiac disorders. Although present methods can
detect \u201cfrank\u201d fibrosis, new methods that target the early
stages of fibrogenesis are expected to be extremely useful as they may
be more effective in guiding interventions that block further
development of fibrosis and prevent the onset of myocardial remodeling
associated with heart failure and arrhythmias.\nProject Goals\nThe goal
of this initiative is to significantly advance non-invasive methods to
detect, image, and monitor myocardial fibrosis in vivo. Myocardial
fibrosis is a hallmark of adverse cardiac remodeling associated with
development of heart failure and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.
Early detection of myocardial fibrosis is essential to development of
effective ways to diagnose, treat, and prevent these cardiac disorders.
Current methods for detection of myocardial fibrosis, however, are
either invasive (e.g., biopsy-based) or unable to detect early
fibrogenesis or diffusively distributed fibrosis in the myocardium. This
 initiative encourages researchers to develop innovative myocardial
fibrosis detection methods that overcome current challenges and
demonstrate their utility in appropriate experimental models.\nPhase I

Treatment Compliance",
        "description": "Summary\nAs a therapeutic option, an array of
existing oral appliances are approved for the medical treatment of
snoring and mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea but lack specific
capabilities necessary to fulfill regulatory requirements and conduct
population-based effectiveness research. Integration of oral appliance
and electronic monitoring technologies is needed to develop enhanced
oral devices capable of addressing regulatory requirements and
facilitating population-based research and clinical trials monitoring
adherence and effectiveness of sleep apnea treatment.\nProject
Goals\nAdapt therapeutic oral appliances currently used to maintain an
open airway during sleep with electronic and sensor technologies to
quantitatively monitor and evaluate patient adherence and the
effectiveness of treatment. Validate the implementation of monitoring
technologies as needed to fulfill regulatory requirements. Since oral
appliances vary in how an open airway is maintained, it is anticipated
that 2-3 different oral appliances with integrated monitoring
capability. Proposals to develop an oral appliance treatment as opposed
to integrate monitoring capabilities into an existing technology will
not be considered responsive to this request.\nPhase I Activities and
Expected Deliverables\nDevelopment of a prototype oral appliance with an
 integrated capability of monitoring treatment adherence and efficacy up
 to 24 hours independent of external power sources and connections. The
enhanced oral appliance must be should not change acceptance of the
device by patients, interfere with therapeutic efficacy of the device,
increase patient burden, or introduce potential electrical or biological
 risks to patient safety over the anticipated life of the instrument.
The prototype must demonstrate that the proposed design specifications
including sensitivity and longevity of sensor technology have been
achieved for successful completion of phase I activities.\nPhase II
Activities and Expected Deliverables\nA sufficient number of working
devices and procedures for deployment and field testing must be
developed. These procedures should validate the capabilities of the
monitoring technology, demonstrate adherence to therapy, and the
efficacy of treatment fulfilling regulatory requirements of the
commercial transportation industry.  Validation includes field testing
in a representative cohort of middle-age men and women diagnosed with
sleep apnea and physician-recommended treatment using an oral appliance.
 The cohort must be designed to allow a stratified analysis of the
device capabilities among apnea patients with Epworth Sleepiness Scale
scores greater than or equal to 10 compared to apnea patients with
scores below 10. The results obtained from device monitoring should be
compared with correlative measures such as actigraphy, daytime
sleepiness and psychomotor vigilance task to establish that the
monitoring capabilities of the integrated device can be used to
accurately predict functional outcomes. Proposals to enhance standard
medical practice in diagnosis or treatment of sleep apnea will not be
considered responsive.",

        "topic_name": "Improving Safety and Efficacy of Red Blood Cells
for Transfusion",
        "description": "Summary\nRed blood cell (RBC) products for
transfusion undergo metabolic and physical changes in both the cellular
and plasma fractions during storage (RBCs can be stored up to 42 days
currently) which may be associated with non-infectious risks and reduced
 tissue oxygenation capacity. The changes that occur during storage have
 been referred to in the literature as the RBCs \u201cstorage
lesion\u201d. Many of these changes have been characterized and include
increasing levels of microparticles and potassium; free hemoglobin
release; decrease in pH, adenosine triphosphate, and
2,3-diphosphoglycerate; loss of RBC membrane flexibility; and changes in
 enzymatic functionality resulting in a loss of nitric oxide (NO)
signaling. Current research suggests that the storage lesion may result
in extravascular hemolysis and inflammation, vasoconstriction, and
potentially suboptimal tissue oxygenation. Many retrospective and
prospective studies, including a recent meta-analysis of 21 studies,
have demonstrated that the transfusion of RBC units which have been
stored for longer periods (up to 42 days) appears to be associated with
increased recipient morbidity and mortality; but these associations may
be confounded by severity of illness. Two large blinded, multi-center
randomized trials are currently underway in the United States and in
Canada to determine if \u201cyounger\u201d vs. \u201colder\u201d or
\u201cstandard age\u201d blood is equally safe and effective in complex
cardiovascular surgery and ICU patients, respectively, but the results
of these studies will not be known for several years.\nWhile it is
unclear at this stage whether the RBC storage lesion results in serious
adverse clinical outcomes in transfusion recipients, it would seem
biologically plausible that a reduction in the number of potentially
toxic elements in RBC supernatants, as well as an increase in the
concentration of well-preserved RBCs, would be beneficial in many ways.
These potential benefits could include 1) improved effectiveness of RBC
products; 2) markedly reduced adverse events; and 3) optimal tissue
oxygenation by fully functioning RBCs. Developing improved blood bank
storage and transfusion processes and practices to mitigate the RBCs
\u201cstorage lesion\u201d, improve the effectiveness of transfusion,
and safely maintain the shelf-life of RBC components at or near the
current FDA mandated maximal storage limit of 42 days, will be important
 to assuring blood availability for future public health needs.\nThere
is scientific evidence that some of the RBC storage lesion changes might
 be reduced, restored or mitigated by changes in blood storage
conditions and\/or through manipulation prior to transfusion with
processes such as washing, filtration and\/or renitrosylation. Multiple
strategies may be needed because targeting any single parameter may be
insufficient to markedly improve RBC product quality.\nThe National
Blood Collection and Utilization Survey Report estimates that a total of
 17.3 million blood units were collected and 14.6 million RBCs units
were transfused in the United States in 2008. Except for pediatric
transfusions, blood banks always deliver the oldest available RBC units
when a RBC transfusion is requested to optimize their inventory
management. It is anticipated that a product and\/or process developed
for this contract Depending on the product, the market may be any or all
 of the following: blood centers, blood banks, and hospitals as these
are the facilities that collect, produce and\/or transfuse RBC component
 units.\nApplicants are encouraged to explore utilization of the NHLBI
SMARTT program (https:\/\/www.nhlbismartt.org\/ ) to assist with the
preclinical and early clinical study planning and regulatory support for
 IND\/IDE applications associated with this contract topic.\nProject
Goals\nThe purpose of this SBIR contract solicitation is to develop new
additive solutions, storage bags and\/or new processes to enhance RBCs
function and survival after storage and transfusion and\/or reduce
non-infectious complications associated with allogeneic RBC component
transfusions.\nAccepted products, devices or technologies for the
contract topic include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 New additive
solutions for RBC component storage,\n\u2022 Novel RBC component storage
 bags or modification of current storage bags,\n\u2022 Small footprint
cell washer and associated disposables for use in hospital blood banks
and transfusion services,\n\u2022 Pre- or post-storage processes and
systems that will deliver a more therapeutic, less toxic transfused RBC
component,\n\u2022 Development of kits, including combinatorial
approaches such as devices and technologies, to achieve the project
goals.\nDevelopment of products and\/or procedures for the sole purpose
of leukoreduction will not be considered responsive to this
solicitation.\nPhase I Activities and Expected Deliverables\nIn Phase I,
 the investigator(s) are expected to complete proof-of-concept, become
knowledgeable of regulatory requirements for required IND\/IDE approval,
 and present the Phase I results and the development plan to NHLBI
staff. The Phase I research plan must contain specific, quantifiable,
and testable feasibility milestones along with alternate approaches if
unexpected data are generated. The new technology needs to result in a
demonstrable reduction in the development of the RBC storage lesion such
 as a decrease in the number of red blood cell microparticles and\/or
better preserved RBC rheology.\nPhase II Activities and Expected
Deliverables\nPhase II should follow the development plan laid out in
the Phase I if the FDA has approved the approach and feasibility has
been demonstrated. Phase II studies should focus on developing the
required technologies and working towards the initiation of clinical
testing.\nDeliverables include the provision of evidence of having
initiated the process leading to IND\/IDE submission (and hopefully
approval), and the documentation that the plan is feasible and that
there are alternate approaches if any contradictory data are generated.
When appropriate, it must be documented that production of sufficient
amount of clinical grade material suitable for an early clinical trial
can occur. The Phase II research plan must contain specific,
quantifiable, and testable feasibility milestones.",

        "description": "Summary\nClinical MRI systems use local surface
receive devices (coils) to provide optimized signal to noise and enable
fast imaging using parallel imaging techniques. These surface coils are
designed for adult patients and function poorly for pediatric patients.
Pediatric coils are targeted at a certain age group and due to the wide
range of pediatric patient sizes (from neonates to preadolescents) it is
 not possible to design one set of surface coils that fit all pediatric
patients. In this solicitation we seek a set of dedicated cardiac MRI
coils that will cover the entire range of pediatric patients.\nProject
Goals\nThe aim is to create a set of four (4) different pediatric
cardiac MRI receive coil arrays to cover the size ranges of the
pediatric population: 1) Neonate\/Premie, 2) 3 months \u2013 2 years, 3)
 4-8 years, 4) 10-12 years. The coils could consist of a semi-rigid
shell in the shape of the pediatric torso and multiple receiver coil
elements will be placed on the shell. Optimal design in terms of coil
element sizes and placement needs to be determined (through simulation
and prototyping) during the project. The goal is to have coils with a
large number of coil elements (16-64) optimized for parallel imaging
(rate 4 for 2D imaging and rates 4-8 for 3D imaging). We envision an
iterative development process where prototype coils are refined and
optimized based on actual experiments in pediatric patients at the NHLBI
 operated MRI system at Children\u2019s National Medical Center (Phase
I). Commercial products will be developed based on the prototypes (Phase
 II).\nPhase I Activities and Expected Deliverables\nPhase I will be
focused on developing and fine-tuning prototypes. The end goal of the
project (after phase II) is to have a commercial set of 4 coils, but for
 phase I, two (2) coils will be expected (e.g. sizes 1 and 4 above).
Phase I will be initiated with discussions between the vendor and NHLBI
about coil sizes, element counts, and parallel imaging performance
expectations. The deliverables for Phase I are:\n\u2022 Initial survey
of reasonable coil geometries for the 4 body sizes mentioned
above.\n\u2022 Simulations of optimal element size and count for all 4
coil sizes.\n\u2022 Two prototype coils (sizes 1 and 4). Compatible with
 a Siemens 64-channel, 1.5T Aera MRI system (Dual Density Signal
Transfer system).\n\u2022 Coil test data needed for a) Siemens safety
compliance, b) NHLBI NMR Safety Committee approval for human use.\nPhase
 II Activities and Expected Deliverables\nPhase II represents the final
commercialization of the set of four (4) coils. Expected
deliverables:\n\u2022 One set of (4) coils approved for human use.",

approximately 10,000 times each year worldwide. The procedure suffers
large anatomic sampling error because of no current appropriate image

mitral valve replacement, currently requires cardiac surgery and
cardiopulmonary bypass. Minithoracotomy access remains high risk. NHLBI
has shown early feasibility of direct transthoracic large-port access to
 the beating heart, and effective closure using nitinol appliances in
animal models. The objective of this contract solicitation is to support
 the commercial development of purpose-built access ports and closure
devices for direct transthoracic cardiac access to the left and right
ventricles.\nProject Goals\nSafe non-surgical access to the beating
heart would be attractive to implant large appliances (such as mitral
valve replacement), to repair complex congenital or structural heart
defects, or to deliver smaller appliances such as transcatheter aortic
valve replacement in the large minority of patients ineligible for
transvascular delivery.\nNHLBI DIR has demonstrated early feasibility of
 this approach using MRI guidance and off-the-shelf nitinol closure
devices. A purpose-built device would be necessary for safe and robust
transthoracic access port and closure.\nPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables\nA phase I award would develop and test a port and closure
device system prototype. The awardee deliverable would be tested in vivo
 in the contracting DIR lab (cardiovascular intervention
program).\nApplicants are directed to several publications from NHLBI
regarding this topic in calendar year 2011 (Pubmed ID: 21234923,
22192372, and 2192373), accessible from
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=21234923,22192372,2192373.\nThe
specific deliverables include:\n\u2022 Access Port\no Access port in at
least two sizes, one being 32Fr and another 24Fr, to accommodate
implantation of large prostheses\no The port (\u201cintroducer
sheath\u201d) should incorporate features to assure retention inside the
 endocavitary space once delivered, to avoid inadvertent exit from the
targeted ventricular cavity.\no The port should have a mechanism to
protect against damage to endoventricular contents (papillary muscles,
chordae tendinae, valve leaflets) during delivery.\no The system should
have a hemostatic valve or equivalent mechanism to allow large
appliances to be introduced into the heart from a transthoracic access
port without significant blood loss and without entry of air.\no The
system should feature sufficient taper, rigidity, and curvature to be
introduced into the left or right ventricle via intercostal and
subxiphoid trajectories, and characteristics to accomplish non-surgical
intercostal separation if necessary.\no The system should allow delivery
 into the heart through the chest initially over a 0.035\u201d
guidewire\no The port should have length sufficient to reach the
mid-left atrium or proximal ascending aorta from a transthoracic
(subxiphoid and intercostal) access route in most patients.\no The
system should be conspicuous under multiple imaging modalities,
including ultrasound and MRI.\no The entire system should be MRI
compatible (free from magnetic displacement and from significant
magnetic susceptibility artifact) based on materials compatibility.  o
The system should be curved to allow operation within a large-bore (70cm
 diameter) MRI system.\n\u2022 Myocardial Closure System\no The
myocardial port must be closed with high reliability, immediate
hemostasis, and with a reliable bail-out mechanism in case of failure.
Targeted clinical reliability will be successful deployment and
immediate hemostasis in 99.9% of attempts.\no Anticipated closure
mechanisms include permanent implants with suitable fixation mechanisms
or suture-delivery. Any closure mechanism must assure high reliability
of deployment, high reliability of success, robust immediate hemostasis,
 extremely low risk of late erosion or pseudoaneurysm, and trivial or no
 degradation of myocardial function.\no One minimal mechanism of bailout
 is a parallel guidewire that allows a bailout\/temporizing hemostatic
mechanism to be inserted quickly and reliably should hemostasis fail, to
 allow controlled surgical rescue. Other options are invited.\no The
design should be safe from early and late myocardial erosion.\no The
proposal should include a risk\/failure analysis\no Operational
considerations should be described, including whether the closure system
 is deployed at the beginning of the transcardiac procedure
(\u201cpre-close\u201d) or at the conclusion.\n\u2022 Strategies should
be defined for use and withdrawal of secondary drainage catheters after
the access port is closed.\nPhase II Activities and Expected
Deliverables\nA phase II award would allow mechanical, fatigue, and
biocompatibility testing and regulatory development for the device to be
 used in human investigation, under Investigational Device Exemption. We
 expect the device will require a PMA for marketing, which is expensive.
 The contracting DIR lab would perform an IDE clinical trial at no cost
to the awardee.\nThe specific Phase II deliverables are as described
under Phase I.\n\u2022 The phase II award would consist of the
contractor obtaining an IDE based on the design finalized in phase I.",

obstructive cardiovascular lesions could have great utility in pediatric
 cardiology, but are unsuitable for small children. Commercially
available stents limit vessel growth and require future surgical
removal. Absorbable stents might revolutionize the treatment of
congenital heart disease in children. Small children require small
delivery systems for devices that are larger than adult coronary
arteries. Specific target diseases include aortic coarctation and
pulmonic stenosis, which currently require open surgical repair or
multiple X-ray-guided catheter procedures in early childhood.  Project
Goals\nThese are transcatheter stents to be delivered using conventional
 interventional cardiovascular techniques including guiding catheters or
 sheaths, translesional guidewires, and balloon-expandable or
self-expanding delivery systems. Conventional and novel approaches are
welcomed.\nSpecific requirements of the stents include small delivery
systems (5-6 French or smaller); sufficient radial force to resist
elastic recoil for the two applications; sustained radial strength
suited to the application for at least 6 months; controlled degradation
within 6-12 months; inflammatory response that does not cause
significant stenosis, restenosis, or aneurysm; resistance to downstream
embolization or toxicity; and nominal calibers suitable for the most
common lesions (pulmonary artery stenosis and aortic coarctation, see
below) .\nProposed stent nominal geometry should be diameter (6-10mm),
length (range 10-25mm), delivery system (5-6 French or smaller). The
radial hoop strength of the deployed device should approach that of
commercial balloon-expandable stent such as the Cordis Palmaz Genesis.
Percutaneous vascular access routes for the pulmonary artery application
 include femoral and jugular venous. Percutaneous vascular access routes
 for aortic coarctation application include transvenous-transeptal
antegrade and retrograde transfemoral artery. The implant or the

Deliverables\nPhase I should focus on mechanical and biological
performance of the proposed biodegradable stents in the intended use for
 pulmonary artery stenosis and aortic coarctation, taking into account
mechanical strength required for the application; geometry of the access
 vessels and geometry and morphology of target vessels including
tapering and branching; strategies to avoid inflammatory restenosis or
constriction; and delivery, implantation, and visualization
strategies.\nAt the conclusion of phase I, a candidate device design
should be selected for clinical development based on in vivo performance
 of a mature prototype resembling a final design. The sponsoring NHLBI
laboratory is willing to perform a limited number in vivo
proof-of-principal experiments in swine (by mutual agreement) to confirm
 mechanical performance.\nPhase II Activities and Expected
Deliverables\nAt the conclusion of phase II, the offeror should obtain
an investigational device exemption (IDE), and a supply of devices
provided, for a first-in-human research protocol, involving at least 10
subjects, to be performed by the sponsoring NHLBI laboratory. The
sponsoring NHLBI laboratory is willing to perform a limited number of in
 vivo proof-of-principal experiments in swine (by mutual agreement).
NHLBI offers to perform the clinical trial at no expense to the offeror,
 to participate in the development of the clinical protocol, and to
provide clinical research services. The vendor is expected to perform or
 obtain safety-related in vivo experiments and data to support the
IDE.\nThe specific Phase II deliverables are as described under Phase
I.\n\u2022 The phase II award would consist of the contractor obtaining
an IDE based on the design finalized in phase I.",

        "topic_name": "Fluorescent Nanodiamonds for In Vitro and In Vivo
 Biological Imaging",
        "description": "Summary\nThere is a need to develop a
biocompatible fluorescent label that never photobleaches or blinks, and
that is brighter than commonly used dyes. Fluorescent nanodiamonds
(FNDs) are 10 to 100 nm sized biocompatible particles with indefinite
photo-stability that make them superior imaging probes for a wide range
of applications. Whereas organic dyes and quantum dots are neither
biocompatible nor photo-stable as they photobleach and blink, and gold
nanoparticles exhibit weak, size and shape dependent fluorescence, FNDs
do not photo-bleach or blink and can provide bright fluorescence. In
particular, their near-infrared fluorescence and biocompatibility make
them ideally suited for in vivo diagnostic applications. The commercial
potential for fluorescent nanodiamonds is enormous. Because of their
superior fluorescence characteristics and inherent biocompatibility,
FNDs could replace the most commonly used optical probes; quantum dots
(QDs) and organic fluorophores.\nThe nanodiamond fluorescence comes from
 nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) centers, point defects in the diamond structure.
 By adjusting the number of N-V centers created in a particle, its
brightness can be tuned for a desired application. FND near-infrared
emissions are not only optimal for in vivo imaging but also can be used
as an optical readout of magnetic resonance. Furthermore, the relatively
 long fluorescence lifetime (~17 ns) of FNDs compared to ~1-2 ns
lifetime of in vivo autofluorescence makes FNDs ideal background-free
agents for time-gated imaging of, for instance various, cardiac
myopathies or blood malignancies where typically blood hemoglobin
interference in fluorescence spectrum has limited the uses of optical
imaging for these pathologies. At the single-molecule level, they can be
 used to track labeled biomolecules over extended periods of time, and
due to their wide excitation spectra, can be used as stable
multispectral fiducial markers for ultra high resolution microscopy
across multiple wavelengths to study sub cellular structures with nm
precision. While these are just a few of the biomedical applications of
FNDs, the energy level structure and electron spin coherence of N-V
centers have potential novel applications in ultra-low magnetic field
detection, ultra-sensitive NMR, ultra-low power consuming spin-based
spintronics, and quantum computing. The commercial routes to develop
this product for are numerous and highly profitable.\nProject
Goals\nCurrently there is no commercial source of fluorescent
nanodiamonds appropriate for biomedical imaging applications. This is a
rapidly emerging field that would be well served by a source of well
characterized FNDs that could be further processed by the end user for a
 wide range of applications in biomedical imaging and
nanotechnology.\nPhase I Activities and Expected Deliverables\nIn Phase
I, we expect 100 grams of fluorescent nanodiamonds. The mean diameter of
 the nanodiamonds should be in the range of 10 to 80 nm, with a
coefficient of variation not to exceed 60%. The peak fluorescence
emission of the nanodiamonds will be in the range of 650-750 nm and they
 will be photostable, i.e., not photobleach, under continuous laser
excitation of 20 mW or less in the range of 500-600 nm. A minimum of 50%
 of the fluorescent nanodiamonds will be at least 10 times brighter
(i.e., 10-fold higher fluorescence emission at the peak emission
wavelength with an optical bandwidth of 30 nm) than Alexa680, which is a
 commonly used near infrared dye. These specifications can be confirmed
with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM)
measurements in which the brightness of fluorescent nanodiamonds and
Alexa680 can be compared side-by-side under identical conditions. We are
 prepared to assist with these measurements if requested. We have
successfully made fluorescent nanodiamonds (~30 nm diameter), but their
brightness must be improved with optimization of the N-V center creation
 and annealing process. The contracting company will be expected to
optimize the process, deliver well-characterized fluorescent
nanodiamonds, and provide a description of the irradiation, annealing,
and any additional processing such that an expert in the field could
reproduce the process. We can assist the company with the
characterization of the nanodiamonds. Phase II Activities and Expected
Deliverables\nIn Phase II, the deliverables will be a range of FNDs with
 different levels of brightness and different sizes. Furthermore, the
more challenging deliverable in Phase II will be a high-yield product
with narrow size and brightness distributions. These well-defined
distributions can either be achieved by determining a method that
generates the desired distributions directly, or by separating the
fluorescent nanodiamonds based on size and brightness after the fact, a
technique that would solve a problem that the fields of nanotechnology
and molecular imaging have been struggling with. ",

profiles that make patient management difficult. Aerosolized delivery
offers the potential to bypass these barriers to drug efficacy by
achieving high drug concentrations in the infected pulmonary tissue with
 lower systemic exposure and by bypassing first-pass hepatic metabolism,
 thus allowing increased immediate potency. Given these potential
benefits, an easy to use, aerosolized delivery system would represent a
significant advance in the treatment of tuberculosis. Though

Anti-Retrovirals",
        "description": "Background\nEffective treatment of HIV-infected
individuals requires strict adherence to a multi-component regimen of
antiretroviral agents that currently must be taken daily on a life-long
basis. Non-compliance with recommended dosing regimens is a significant
factor contributing to the incomplete suppression of HIV and to the
development of drug resistance. The development of long-acting
formulations that might significantly simplify the dosing requirements
potentially could facilitate improvements in patient adherence.
Long-acting formulations also would have utility as components of drug
regimens provided to uninfected individuals for pre-exposure prophylaxis
 (PrEP) purposes. Some orally administered antiretrovirals readily
penetrate and accumulate in rectal and female genital tract mucosa and
achieve concentrations in those tissues higher than in plasma.
Formulations based on antiretrovirals with these properties might have
utility both as systemic and PrEP agents and thus are particularly
attractive as formulation development candidates.\nProject Goals\nThe
goal of this SBIR contract solicitation is to support small businesses
interested in developing novel formulations of antiretroviral drugs that
 can achieve clinically relevant systemic or tissue concentrations and
maintain these levels for an extended period of time. Formulations that
need only be administered once per month are of particular interest;
however, formulations that extend the dosing interval to once a week or
better still might be valuable additions to current or future PrEP and
treatment strategies. Antiretroviral agents selected for formulation
development should either be FDA-approved or in mid- to late-stage
preclinical development (estimated time to clinical evaluation of 1-3
years). Offerors will be responsible for obtaining the parent
antiretroviral compounds for their formulation efforts and for resolving
 any intellectual property issues that might arise regarding use of
these compounds.\nPhase I Activities\n1. Develop prototype formulations

alternative formulations of approved first and second line anti-TB drugs

child-friendly formulations of pediatric first and second-line anti-TB

standard practice to cut or crush un-scored adult tablets and administer
 them to children in juice or other palatable substances. This has
significant potential to deliver incorrect and highly variable doses to

pediatric applications is a recent regulatory requirement for novel
drugs in general, this requirement does not apply to approved, TB drugs
that are off patent and manufactured as generics. Additionally,
treatment of adult and pediatric patients may include the administration

 for medical rehabilitation purposes is to replace lost functionality
for people with physical disabilities. While great strides have been
made in the neuroprosthetics field, the state of the art falls far short
 of complete restoration of function. For example, there is no consensus
 on the best modality for extracting signals from the central nervous
system, peripheral nervous system, or the musculoskeletal system. There
is insufficient evidence of reliable, long-term neural interfaces in
human subjects. There are no decoding algorithms that allow for quick,
natural, and diverse use of multiple degrees of freedom in the end
effector. There is insufficient use of sensory input to close the
feedback loop. There are no common measures for training and testing of
neural interfaces and human subjects.\nTechnical areas of particular
interest that address unmet challenges in neuroscience, medicine,
materials, and engineering include: (1) Novel, reliable, and scalable
biotic-abiotic interfaces for recording neural or muscle signals;
innovation in tissue interface systems that demonstrate high-levels of
neural-information extraction, low levels of error, and long functional
lifetimes are highly encouraged. (2) Reliable, effective, and clinically
 viable algorithms for decoding limb-control signals; new algorithmic
approaches that maximize the amount and rate of limb-control information
 while reducing the error, degree of pre-processing, and need for
recalibration over time are highly encouraged. (3) Novel, reliable, and
scalable biotic-abiotic interfaces for providing sensory stimulation.
Proposals should address novel methods that go beyond conventional
neural stimulation approaches in order to extend the clinical
applications of neural stimulation. Approaches may include, but are not
limited to electronic, photonic, tactile, ultrasonic, or chemical
stimulation platforms. (4) Training and testing methods; identification
of common metrics related to function that would allow systematic
investigation of signal processing is encouraged.\nApplications for this

field of neural or muscle interfaces with the emphasis on a more
naturally controlled prosthesis for people with movement impairments by
improving the person\/device interface. This solicitation seeks novel
approaches for the fusion of neural data with the intent of controlling
extracorporeal systems. Proposals designed to capture neural-control
signals from central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS sources (e.g.,

to the above budget amounts and project periods. Proposals with budgets
exceeding the above amounts and project periods may not be

them.\n\u2014 C. Everett Koop, M.D, former U.S. Surgeon
General\nMedication adherence is described as the extent to which
patients take medications as prescribed by their health care
providers.\nA World Health Organization (WHO) report confirms that
almost half of patients with chronic illnesses do not take medications
as prescribed. Low medication adherence greatly lowers efficacy; and it
leads to preventable prolongation of illnesses, re-hospitalizations and
sometimes death. Approximately 125,000 Americans die annually (342
people every day) due to poor medication adherence. Every day,
prescription non-adherence costs more than $270 million in additional
hospitalization and other medical costs. Nine out of every 10
outpatients are taking prescribed medicines improperly, contributing to
prolonged or additional illness. Cost of non-adherence to medications is
 estimated approximately $100 billion a year in the U.S. In addition,
other forms of medication non-adherence such as misuse, underuse or
overuse (abuse) also have negative consequences in
individuals.\nMedication non-adherence is especially burdensome to
patients with substance use disorders who are prescribed medications for
 psychiatric and medical conditions. In addition, approximately 50% of
patients prescribed Buprenorphine for opioid dependence and NRT\/other
medications for smoking cessation report taking medications as
prescribed.\nNIDA seeks to develop and test prototype mobile\/tablet
technology-based application to provide a low-cost, highly personalized,
 interactive patient-centric medication adherence tool that improves
upon currently available mobile technology-based medication adherence
applications.\nBackground Information\nThe WHO, Institute of Medicine
(IOM), National Institute of Health (NIH), American Heart Association
(AHA) and advocacy organizations have all acknowledged that this is both
 a complex and a difficult issue to solve but the time for action is
now.\nBarriers to medication adherence are complex, variable and reside
at multiple levels: the patient, the provider, the healthcare system and
 their interactions.  Systematic reviews have found that existing
medication adherence interventions yield only modest benefits and while
simple reminder systems do work, most of the systems were complex,
cost-prohibitive and labor-intensive greatly limiting
generalizability.\nAdherence is an active process but existing low-cost
solutions are passive. Examples of commercially available apps for
Android and Apple devices: Pillbox Alert, Med Minder, Med Helper -
Prescription App, MyMedSchedule, Dosecast, RxmindMe, Intelecare. They
are typically simple to use and employ visual aids but are limited by
patient input of their medications; sole reliance on reminders;
predominant focus on the use of English language; and not always Health
Insurance Privacy and Portability Act of 1996 (HIPPA) and Health
Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act
compliant.\nOther solutions use electronic pillboxes which record pill
use by the patient and in some cases, provide reminders: MEMS cap,
Wisepill device, Med-eMonitor, etc. These products have limited main
stream application due to high costs of these stand-alone devices that
typically record one medication per container; with limited links to
real-time and interactive feedback or education; and most have limited
programming capacity.\nThe newer FDA approved medical devices such as
the SIMpill\u00ae Medication Adherence System and the PillStation\u00ae
medication adherence system are more complex and offer adherence
reminders and organization solutions but do not provide tailored
interventions based on the patient\u2019s baseline, nor do they address
adverse effects, other barriers to medication adherence.\nPhase I
Activities and Expected Deliverables\nDevelop and test the acceptability
 and feasibility of a mobile\/tablet-based technology application
prototype that improves medication adherence by successfully addressing
the barriers to medication adherence and contain the following
features:\n\u2022 Allow multiple user input and interaction (i.e.
between physician, pharmacy, patient, caregiver\/parent) and superiority
 to existing mobile applications and electronic pillbox\/medication
monitoring tools; \u2022 The core medication adherence enhancement
solution is to be a mobile application. However, hybrid solutions that
link to external systems will be preferred, e.g. demonstrate capacity to
 link to external electronic databases, such as pharmacy, laboratory
and\/or medication information systems; other existing stand alone
medication monitoring tools such as electronic pillboxes, etc.;\n\u2022
Account for low health literacy and visual impairment needs of
patient;\n\u2022 Demonstrate capabilities for GIS, GPS, SMS, phone,
Bluetooth, online, video and other platforms of real-time
communication;\n\u2022 Eliminate patient need to enter medication
information (i.e. names and doses of medications) through the use of
barcodes, photo\/camera capabilities and similar technologies;\n\u2022
Demonstrate capabilities to link to patient\u2019s record in EMR, EHR,
pharmacy database and other healthcare systems (e.g. appointment
scheduling systems, provider locations, etc.);\n\u2022 Use computational
 modeling, branching logic and\/or query functions to develop
sophisticated adherence solution algorithms for the software;\n\u2022
Provide a baseline ecological momentary assessment of patient\u2019s
status (such psychiatric and\/or physical symptoms, mood states, drug
cravings\/drug use) and its impact on medication adherence, so that
customized interventions can be delivered to the patient, based on their
 ability;\n\u2022 Offer a menu of customizable adherence strategies,
based on each individual\u2019s baseline rate of medication adherence,
ranging from simple to complex (and provide some rating mechanism for
the strategies offered);\n\u2022 Offer tailored medication education
content suited for adult learning and links to reliable information

possession of controlled substances. A large percentage of prescription
medicines are never used or are used in much smaller quantities than
prescribed. For example, a recent study showed that among upper
extremity surgery patients, who were prescribed an average dose of 30
narcotic pills, approximately half only used 2 days worth of pills or
fewer Rodgers et al 2012). This illustrates how leftover medicine is a
large problem. Death of an elderly family member or medication changes
can also result in surplus controlled substances in the home.\nResults
from the most recent (2010) National Survey on Drug Use and Health
(NSDUH) show prescription drug misuse is generally initiated via
\u201cdiversion\u201d- when people are given psychoactive pills (or
steal) from friends or relatives. Accordingly, safe drug disposal is a
pillar of the President\u2019s Prescription Drug Strategy
http:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/ondcp\/issues-content\/prescription-drugs\/rx_abuse_plan_0.pdf
 (page 7) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is in the process of
 rulemaking on the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010.
This rulemaking likely will involve a combination of take-back and other
 means to return medication to facilities with incinerators.\nAside from
 cost, one problem with all such programs is the drug remains available
to use\/misuse\/abuse until incineration or other final disposal.
Currently, DEA provides labor-intensive prescription drug disposal
\u201ctakeback\u201d programs that visit sites to collect unused
medications from households (e.g.
http:\/\/www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov\/drug_disposal\/non_registrant\/transcript_diposalmtg_011911.pdf).
 Federal sponsorship of this program underscores the high interest in
this problem.\nAlthough there are products like drug shredding machines
that are deployed in nursing homes and other care-giving venues
www.ultimateproducts.us\/DrugShredder.htm#features, there are few
alternatives for safe medication removal by patients in the home. For
most scheduled medicines, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
recommends mixing the medicines with coffee grounds or kitty litter and
then throwing these medicines in the trash. This process presumes
availability of such material in the household. Notably, in addition to
risk of diversion, household disposal of some medications in solid waste
 (especially in transdermal patches)
http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/Drugs\/DrugSafety\/ucm300747.htm can create
hazards to children and pets.\nFDA has recommended that only a subset of
 medications be flushed -
http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/drugs\/resourcesforyou\/consumers\/buyingusingmedicinesafely\/ensuringsafeuseofmedicine\/safedisposalofmedicines\/ucm186187.htm.
 Flushing some types of unused medications into the water supply can
create environmental hazards and is only recommended for medications
that pose the most imminent risk if accidentally ingested.\nAn in-home
prescription medicine deactivation or disposal system would meet the
goal of having an immediate method to render unused medicine harmless.
Recent advances in technology offer the opportunity for companies to add
 technology-based features such as mobile phone applications that could
include medication expiration dates and disposal reminders.\nFamilies
with small children and pets are likely audiences for this product in
terms of prevention of poisoning. As such, sales of this product may
benefit from positioning by child-proofing and pet-proofing products.
Parents of teenagers (particularly teens who are known to have
experimented with alcohol or marijuana) are likely consumers of this
product as well. At home drug test kits are routinely sold in
pharmacies, and positioning this product near opioid test-kits is a
natural marketing strategy. Finally, \u201cgreen\u201d consumers,
interested in reducing their environmental impact may consider such a
product for its environmental benefits.\nPhase I Activities and Expected
 Deliverables\nThis SBIR topic will help address the need for safe,
at-home deactivation of divertible medications for home disposal in
solid or liquid waste or before transit for third-party disposal. It is
expected that potential offerors can demonstrate with preliminary data
that agents or devices in their proposals (such as chemical-based
drug-deactivating agents, nanomaterials or mechanical processes) will
inactivate the proposed chemical class of psychoactive medication and
its medium of delivery (e.g. tablet, capsule, or patch) in direct
application (not embedded in a device or product). It is not expected
that a single agent or device would be suitable or capable of
deactivating all classes of medication or deactivating across all forms
of medication delivery.\nSpecifically, the contractor will be provided
with funding to develop this agent or device into a consumer-friendly,
low-cost, and simple-to-use product for home use that contains the
drug-deactivating device or agent, into which medication may be dropped,
 inserted, mixed or adhered for inactivation and disposal.\nPhase I
testing should include testing the product for ease of portability,
storage, and use. The device or product should be able to be handled and
 transported by an elderly or physically-challenged consumer. Because
repeat use of this type of product hinges on the user experience being
at minimum not unpleasant, focus groups may address ease of use and
aesthetic factors for the \u201cdisposal system\u201d. Phase I may also
include development and testing of materials such as instruction sets,
educational materials, calendars, and mobile applications to facilitate
use the product.\nDeliverables will include:\n1. Product usability
testing to establish that the product can be easily used by the targeted
 users, including elderly patients and their caregivers, families with
young and teenage children (particularly women). For example, testing
should assess the degree to which having to open the medication
container for inactivation of its contents paradoxically introduces
exposure and toxicity risk. Additionally, tests should ensure the
product provides an optimized aesthetic experience (i.e., does not emit
unpleasant or noticeable odors) and is amenable to cleaning, if the
product is a reusable device.\n2. Market research to determine how the
proposed product could either compete with, compliment, or assist
existing drug-disposal schemes, like in-person drop-off boxes at
participating pharmacies or programs that provide mailers to consumers
to mail unused medications to an incineration service. This research
should be geared toward determining whether the product would have a
market for direct sales to families, or would be best distributed by
pharmacies as part of the costs of scheduled drug dispensing. Notably,
the product should have a unit cost low enough to be either sold readily
 directly to consumers or distributed routinely with medications and
prescriptions along with patient information sheets.\n3. Risk-assessment
 and solutions for product liability issues with regard to
incompletely-deactivated medications, such as from misuse of the
product.  4. Toxicology assessment to demonstrate that the agent or
product itself (or as an amalgam with a medication), is non-toxic and
either directly disposable or eligible for transport by the postal
service or other commercial carriers.\nPhase II Activities and Expected
Deliverables\nProjects that demonstrate feasibility, safety, and
marketability of the product\/device in Phase I may be extended into
Phase II. In Phase II, the offeror will be expected to have packaged the
 deactivating agent or device in a deployable form for
mass-distribution. In addition, in Phase II the offeror will be expected
 to conduct assays, tests or surveys to assess:\n1. Degree of adherence
by prescribers, pharmacies, and\/or home users\n2. Whether use under
normal household conditions improves outcomes (e.g., reduces calls to
poison centers, changes total medication reported used or total
medication reported destroyed). Such a test should include random or
quasi-random assignment of patients and families typically prescribed
narcotics and likely to have leftover medicine (e.g., acute injury
patients or patients undergoing orthopedic surgery.) Because certain
individuals are at high risk for substance misuse it is recommended
investigators stratify assignment based on whether people have a history
 of a substance use disorder, chronic pain, or mental illness.\n3. The
classes of chemical compositions or delivery systems of medicines
(transdermal patch, tablets, capsules) for which the device or agent is
most effective or exclusively effective. This might be specific
individual medicines.\n4. Adverse events from use of the product\n5. The
 durability or shelf-life of the product, so as to establish and provide
 expiration dates of products that use chemical or nano-particle based
inactivating agents.\n6. Development of ancillary materials to ensure
adoption and consistent use- such as educational and public-awareness
materials, a programmable adherence application for a mobile phone, or
paper reminder calendars.",

        "topic_name": "Development of Predictive in vivo Screening
Systems for Phenotypic Drug Discovery for Smoking Cessation",
        "description": "Summary\nPhenotypic drug discovery is a
complement to target-based drug discovery and provides an alternative
approach that begins by querying more complex cellular of physiological
systems instead of specific targets. The possible advantage resides in
the fact that a relevant biological context is interrogated without
predisposed bias toward mechanism(s). Thus, an opportunity is created to
 identify compounds that may interact with one or more targets or
pathways not anticipated by a single mechanism-driven hypothesis. In
essence, phenotypic approaches screen multiple mechanisms and targets
simultaneously. This solicitation for Small Business Innovation Research
 (SBIR) contract proposals invites contract proposals from small
business concerns (SBCs) for a multi-pronged research program to develop
 and evaluate a weighted battery of animal behavioral tests that can be
used for the phenotypic drug discovery and development of smoking
cessation medications. The battery should be, preferably, high- or
medium- throughput and designed to improve the predictive validity of in
 vivo screening of drug candidates. Since people continue to smoke for
many different reasons - withdrawal relief, pleasure, taste, improvement
 in concentration, weight control, stress control, arousal, etc. \u2013
the battery should be capable of assessing the multiple components
(reinforcement, affective, cognitive, etc.) that underlie smoking. The
offeror is expected to identify and propose the behavioral domains of
particular importance to human tobacco dependence, and to develop the
necessary animal behavioral protocols to test multiple processes
believed to be contributing to smoking in humans. It is not necessary
that the behavioral measures model the aspects of smoking in precise
fashion. That is, this contract solicitation focuses on the predictive
(and construct) validity of the behavioral battery, not on its face
validity. The SBC must screen in uniform fashion and, then, build a
large database of pharmacological signatures of currently available
medications (with known anti-smoking efficacy in humans) comprised of
measures reflecting the reinforcement, affective, cognitive, etc.
functions. The critical part of this solicitation is the focus on
biostatistical\/computational solutions and modeling. Bioinformatics
algorithms are to be developed which will complement and enhance the
statistical power to recognize phenotypic profiles of drugs. Proposals
are expected to include animal behavior tests only.\nBackground
Information\nDespite major developments in computational, in vitro and
ex vivo model systems, in vivo animal testing remains a necessary part
of drug development. This solicitation invites offers from SBCs
interested in developing a weighted battery of animal behavioral
tests\/assays (rat or mouse) to function as a screening system for
preclinical development of smoking cessation medications.\nIn this
solicitation, behavioral assay is defined as a means of qualifying a
dependent biological variable. In this solicitation, animal model is
defined as a theoretical description of the way a system (or disease)
works. The animal model induces under- or over-expression of a
biological variable which assay quantifies. This solicitation seeks to
establish a battery of carefully selected behavioral tests\/assays that
will provide a comprehensive behavioral assessment of domains of
particular importance in tobacco smoking and quitting. A battery must be
 comprised of currently used and available tests whose appropriateness
and validation could be assessed through literature search. Applications
 proposing new animal models or assays are not allowed.\nThis assay
battery will be used to obtain standardized data on the responses to
existing first-line pharmacotherapies that have been approved by FDA as
aids for smoking cessation (i.e. varenicline, bupropion ), and
second-line pharmacotherapies (i.e. clonidine, nortriptyline). Measuring
 several domains and several medications will result in obtaining a rich
 dataset, which is to be systematically analyzed for identification of
critical parameters or axes, selecting the most useful features and
identifying underlying variables. The critical parameters in each domain
 are to be selected to be combined into final, \u201clean\u201d,
standardized and validated battery of assays, with the goal to provide
superior reliability, greater statistical power and higher throughput
than standard methods. This validated battery of assays will be used for
 in vivo screening of anti-smoking drug candidates to advance future
research and discovery in this area.\nBecause of the importance of
tobacco-dependence treatment to national tobacco control efforts, the
National Cancer Institute and the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA) convened a meeting, entitled \u201cTranslational Medication
Development for Nicotine Dependence Workshop.\u201d Participants from
industry, academia and government agencies provided their views on the
greatest opportunities for accelerating the translational efforts in the
 area of nicotine dependence. One of the challenges in medications
development for addictive disorders is to determine the predictive
validity of preclinical and clinical pharmacology models of various
aspects of drug dependence. Several pharmacotherapies are, in fact,
available to support treatment of nicotine (tobacco) dependence,
including ones with an overt nicotinic mechanism of action, such as
nicotine replacement therapies and varenicline (Chantix\u00ae,
Champix\u00ae), others, in which nicotinic mechanisms may be a
component, such as bupropion (Zyban\u00ae), and still others, for which
there is no obvious nicotinic component to their action (e.g., the
second-line medication clonidine, an \u03b12 adrenergic agonist). Each
of these drugs significantly improves the quit-rate compared to placebo.
 With these currently available medications, however, only about 20% of
smokers are able to maintain long-term abstinence, and more efficacious
pharmacotherapies need to be developed promptly.\nScientific knowledge
to be achieved through research supported by this contract\nBasic
research into the mechanisms of nicotine addiction has the benefit of
the availability of a wide array of preclinical animal behavioral models
 and assays. A number of these tests have seen extensive use as research
 tools, and, as a result, they are known to have utility in studying the
 mechanisms and processes related to addiction and drug abuse relapse.
In addition, some of these models, such as drug-self administration and
drug discrimination, have demonstrated translational utility in
providing preclinical data in support of the development of varenicline.
 However, given that varenicline is the only smoking cessation
pharmacotherapy to have been developed through the typical
pharmaceutical industry drug discovery approach, there is little
evidence for the predictive validity of any of these animal behavioral
models for medication development for drug addiction. Indeed, since
inadequate efficacy remains a significant cause of failure in the drug
development process, improvements in the ability to predict efficacy at
various stages across the drug development process are warranted. The
intent of this contract solicitation is to fund small business concerns
(SBCs) capable to undertake screening of anti-smoking medications (with
various mechanisms of action and known to demonstrate some efficacy in
humans) in multiple animal behavior paradigms. Although addiction is
frequently and preferentially conceptualized in terms of reward and
reinforcement, this contract solicitation seeks to collect data
simultaneously in other domains that may be relevant to drug addiction
and drug abuse relapse, namely cognition and affect. For each of these
domains, there exist well-established assays and models that have
validity within the domain (e.g., for reward and reinforcement \u2013
drug self-administration, intra-cranial self-stimulation; for cognition -
 pre-pulse inhibition, 5 choice serial reaction time; affect -
open-field test, elevated plus-maze). It is important to note that these
 examples are not intended to be exclusive or prescriptive; other models
 may be worthy of validation in this effort. The purpose of this
initiative is to support research to estimate if individually and\/or
collectively these tests are predictive of medication efficacy in
clinical trials.\nA critical part of this solicitation focuses on
improving the reproducibility of preclinical data which will be
obtained. Given the high cost of clinical drug development, factors such
 as low reproducibility and translatability, or heterogeneity in study
design that hinder the comparison of preclinical data are major
disincentives for investment in development of novel treatments.
Diseases of addiction are not among the priorities for pharmaceutical
companies. In addition, a major concern highlighted in other CNS- and
non-neurologic disease areas is the poor reproducibility of preclinical
data for compounds progressing from academic laboratories to industrial
development programs and, ultimately, to clinical trials. The reasons
for these obstacles are multiple and varied, but methodological issues
related to the design, execution, and reporting of preclinical studies
are important components. Thus, offerors are expected to meticulously
address methodological issues in their applications and, if successfully
 selected, in execution of this contract.  Fig 1 illustrates the basics
of the concept. Please note that the examples of behavioral paradigms
are not intended to be exclusive or prescriptive. The offeror is
expected to identify and propose the behavioral domains of particular
importance, and to develop the necessary animal behavioral protocols to
test multiple processes believed to be contributing to smoking in
humans. In general, the tests chosen should be ones that have been used
pre-clinically, so that reliability of the data generated has been
established and that there exists some conceptual understanding of what
the test measures. In addition, while considering models for the reward
and positive reinforcement domain, investigators must be aware that
certain animal behavioral tests appear not to generate reliable data
with nicotine, and these should not be proposed (e.g., conditioned place
 preference, nicotine-primed reinstatement). Equally, it is important to
 highlight the fact that this contract solicitation is not intended as a
 mechanism to support the development of new behavioral models, assays
or tests, or to uncover novel behavioral processes or neurobiological
mechanisms. Nor is it intended to be directed only to investigators with
 addiction research expertise. NIDA welcomes the interest of small
businesses who have expertise with animal models that have not seen wide
 use in addiction research (e.g., potentiated startle, elevated plus
maze), but that might be useful as part of a screening
battery.\nOfferors must provide the rationale for:\n\u2022 Selecting the
 model system. A detailed description of the animal model
characteristics such as a definition of study population using a common
strain and individual commercial stock designations of each animal
provider, diet, housing conditions, microbial status and handling should
 be described. Before using compounds in the rat or mouse, detailed
information about the cross-reactivity of the compounds with the target
in the rat or mouse is necessary. For example, lower binding affinity in
 mice would require higher dosing which, in turn, might compromise
target specificity and affect the results of testing. In addition, other
 interspecies differences should be taken into consideration. Bupropion
is metabolized differently in the rat compared to human and mouse.
Therefore, offerors need to specify how they will address this and
similar species differences (e.g., comparison of dosing with bupropion
compared to its metabolite over a sufficient dose\/time range).\n\u2022
Selecting the assays\/models for the behavioral domains to be studied.
Provide the rationale for the selected domains, assays, models and end
points. The proposed tests must be validated for their specificity and
selectivity to measure clinically relevant symptom(s) or physiological
parameters. It is expected that, regardless of the model or assay chosen
 for testing, investigators will propose an approach that is sensitive
to the need for relatively high throughput assessment. Approaches that
require lengthy training or assessment periods will be deemed not
feasible. For behavioral domains different from Reward, testing in
nondependent animals is expected. Testing in animal models of nicotine
dependence is not required, although may be proposed if justified and
deemed consistent with high- and medium-throughput. There are a variety
of behavioral tests in the behavioral neuroscience field that could be
adapted to this purpose of phenotypic drug screening. For the selection
and validation of the tests, it is important to recognize that some
drugs that provide similar phenotypic effects have differential
effectiveness in aiding smoking cessation. For example, nicotine
improves attentional function and does help with smoking cessation,
whereas amphetamine also improves attentional function but there is no
evidence for it aiding smoking cessation. Buproprion is an
antidepressant and aids smoking cessation but sertraline which also is
an antidepressant has not been found to help smoking cessation. It is
thus important to integrate the phenotypic information with the
neuropharmacological information to help develop a more integrated
neurobehavioral approach. Importantly, the selected behavioral
tests\/models must provide internal behavioral validation such as
learning rate or habituation which offers assurance that the conditions
of the tests are appropriate.\n\u2022 Adequacy of controls. Verification
 that interventional drugs reached and engaged the target. A potential
concern about the specificity of drug effects in this screen \u2013
establishing a balance between sensitivity and specificity- should be
addressed through selection of appropriate drug controls. The evaluation
 of both of these components, sensitivity and specificity, of predictive
 validity is vital in work of this type to avoid costly clinical studies
 of false-positive drugs that affect behaviors in preclinical screens
but are ineffective in humans that are addicted to tobacco.\n\u2022
Selecting the dose, timing and route of administration for the
medications being tested. A drug administration and dose regimen that is
 adapted to the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug, and to the
duration of the study requires careful consideration. The rationale for
dosing the animal must be evident from appropriate pharmacodynamic and
pharmacokinetic assays, published in the literature or obtained in
applicants\u2019 laboratories. The route of administration is important
not only because of animal welfare, but also out of consideration that
the oral route is the desired route of administration in humans. Hence,
oral dosing is preferable whenever possible. Frequent subcutaneous,
intraperitoneal or intravenous injections lead to considerable stress in
 the animals and could influence test outcome. Assistant application
devices, such as minipumps, should be avoided wherever possible, as they
 require surgery, additional control groups and can cause technical
complications. For testing, a minimum of 3 doses of first and second
line medications should be proposed. All of the medications are to be
screened in each model proposed for evaluation.\n\u2022 Selecting the
experimental design.\no Must describe methods of blinding, strategies
for randomization and \/or stratification. To improve the reliability of
 the proposed studies, the offeror must use randomization to eliminate
systematic differences between treatment groups; induce the condition
under investigation without knowledge of whether or not the animal will
get the drug of interest; and assess the outcome in a blinded
fashion.\no Demonstrate the reconciliation between statistical needs for
 the detection of biological effects and constraints of animal welfare,
cost and time. To guard against 'underpowered' studies, researchers must
 calculate the number of animals required to have a reasonable chance of
 detecting the anticipated effect given the expected variance of the
data. A detailed discussion about the use of appropriate statistics must
 be provided, including the evidence that applicants consulted a
statistician to obtain information about the sufficient group size, and
the appropriate statistical method to be applied for data analysis for
each behavioral test and adapting the statistical approach for combining
 data across behavioral tests in developing an optimized predictive
\u2018screening system.\u2019\no Detailed description of statistical
methods used in analysis and interpretation of results\n\u2022
Guidelines on nicotine dose selection for in vivo research. If the
models, in which in vivo nicotine dosage is warranted, are selected for
this project, an evidence for species-specific nicotine dosage ranges
must be presented. Nicotine dose ranges tolerated by humans and their
animal models provide guidelines for experiments intended to extrapolate
 to human tobacco exposure through cigarette smoking or nicotine
replacement therapies. Just as important are the nicotine dosaging
regimens used to provide a mechanistic framework for acquisition of
drug-taking behavior, dependence, tolerance, or withdrawal in animal
models. The literature is replete with reports in which a dosaging
regimen chosen for a specific nicotine-mediated response was suboptimal
for the species used. Guidelines on nicotine dose selection for in vivo
research must be consulted (Psychopharmacology (2007)
190:269\u2013319).\nPhase I Activities and Expected Deliverables\n\u2022
 Select the behavioral assays and models representing the behavioral
domains of particular importance believed to be contributing to smoking
and quitting in humans.\n\u2022 Develop the necessary animal behavioral
protocols to test multiple processes in those identified domains. Must
finalize the selection of model systems, controls, experimental design,
the dose, timing and route of administration, and provide verification
that interventional drugs reached and engaged the target.\n\u2022
Demonstrate that the selected behavioral tests are capable of high or
medium throughput.\n\u2022 Must agree and comply with good reporting
practices, such as ARRIVE Guidelines. The ARRIVE guidelines consist of a
 checklist of 20 items describing the minimum information that all
scientific publications reporting research using animals should include,
 such as the number and specific characteristics of animals used
(including species, strain, sex, and genetic background); details of
housing and husbandry; and the experimental, statistical, and analytical
 methods (including details of methods used to reduce bias such as
randomization and blinding). All the items in the checklist have been
included to promote high-quality, comprehensive reporting to allow an
accurate critical review of what was done and what was found (see:
Improving Bioscience Research Reporting: The ARRIVE Guidelines for
Reporting Animal Research, PloS Biology, 2010, Volume 8, issue 6,

must be reported.\n\u2022 Must provide data interpretation, including
alternative interpretations. Must include the review of relevant
literature in support or in disagreement with results.\nPhase II
Activities and Expected Deliverables\n\u2022 Establish the battery of
carefully selected behavioral tests.\n\u2022 Demonstrate that the
battery of carefully selected behavioral tests is capable of high or
medium throughput. Demonstrate that this battery can make data
collection and analysis more efficient without compromising the quality
of the phenotypic assessment.\n\u2022 Demonstrate that the battery of
carefully selected behavioral tests is sufficiently sensitive to produce
 a comprehensive behavioral assessment in functional domains of cardinal
 importance for tobacco dependence.\n\u2022 In selected model systems,
using appropriate controls, experimental design, the dose, timing and
route of administration, obtain standardized data on the responses to
existing first-line pharmacotherapies that have been approved by FDA as
aids for smoking cessation (i.e. varenicline, bupropion ), and
second-line pharmacotherapies (i.e. clonidine, nortriptyline).  \u2022
Establish, test and validate the bioinformatics algorithms\/processes
which are able to quickly and reliably recognize phenotypic profiles
produced by varenicline, bupropion, clonidine and nortriptyline. The
proposed bioinformatic approach must aid the predictions of the
therapeutic effect of candidate compounds for smoking cessation to be
developed in the future.\n\u2022 Confirm that multivariate and\/or
bioinformatics algorithms are able to discriminate between varenicline-,
 bupropion-, clonidine- and nortriptyline-treated animals and at least
two positive and two negative controls.\n\u2022 Demonstrate the
compliance with good reporting practices, such as ARRIVE Guidelines. The
 ARRIVE guidelines consist of a checklist of 20 items describing the
minimum information that all scientific publications reporting research

        "topic_name": "Video Game Targeting Relapse Prevention in Youth
with Substance Use Disorders",
        "description": "Objective\nThis topic addresses the need for
improved relapse rates among adolescent substance abusers. A video game
should be designed for substance using adolescents in a commercializable
 and compelling package, for the purpose of reinforcing and maintaining
behavior changes (e.g., skills development) accomplished through a
theory-driven and evidence-based therapy. The video game may be
compatible with an off the shelf commercially available gaming system.
The project may, depending on the console selected, also involve
development of peripherals for use with the system. The technology used
must be familiar and accessible to youth, and developmentally
appropriate.\nBackground\nDespite advances in the development of
treatments for adolescents with substance use disorders, relapse remains
 a significant concern. Although approaches to adolescent substance
abuse almost exclusively focus on abstinence, relapse is likely to occur
 for one third to one half of youth, within 12 months of treatment
completion (Grella, Joshi &amp; Hser, 2004; Winters, Botzet, &amp;
Fahnhorst, 2011). Some studies report that less than half of adolescents
 are abstinent 3 months after discharge from outpatient treatment
programs (Brown et al., 2001, Dennis et al., 2004, Kaminer et al., 2002,
 Winters, 2003). In the study of adolescent relapse risk, continuing
care and aftercare have repeatedly been shown to reduce the likelihood
of relapse and enhance the maintenance of treatment gains (Burleson,
Kaminer, &amp; Burke, 2012; Winters et al., 2011).\nDigital media and
communication technology is pervasive in youth culture. Developing a
video game for the purpose of maintaining treatment gains, using
technology that is appealing, accessible and familiar to youth, and
developmentally-appropriate, has the potential to greatly improve
relapse rates in this population. This technology could improve
engagement and reach, as well as reduce the cost and time burden of
implementation on community treatment providers. Recent research by
Girard et al (2009) has shown that participating in video game sessions
that included behaviors that were incompatible with smoking cigarettes
(crushing virtual cigarettes), within a virtual environment was more
efficacious for smoking cessation than a similar game in which patients
found and crushed virtual balls. The mechanism of this treatment is not
well understood and it may be a form of extinction, counter
conditioning, exposure with response prevention, or re-evaluative
conditioning. Nonetheless, such practice in a \u201cgame\u201d
environment may be uniquely helpful because it can deliver a large
\u201cdose\u201d of alternative practice in a manner that people not
just tolerate but also enjoy. The fact Girard et al\u2019s short
duration gaming experience could improve outcomes in comparison with a
\u201cplacebo\u201d control suggests that video games may hold great
promise for treating addiction.\nPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables\n\u2022 Modification of an existing game or development of a
 new therapeutic game for use by one or several players (e.g., internet
based, social networking opportunity)\n\u2022 Development of peripherals
 to interact with the game as needed\n\u2022 The game should provide
opportunities for participants to practice skills learned in treatment

(NTD) Programs",
        "description": "Background: Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)
are bacterial and parasitic infections that disproportionately affect
poor and marginalized populations around the world. A subset of NTDs,
including lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis,
trachoma and intestinal helminth infections, can be targeted effectively
 through mass chemotherapy. These NTDs are not considered to cause
appreciable mortality; however, they are associated with high levels of
morbidity because of the chronic nature of many of the infections.
Blindness and disability due to these NTDs increase in prevalence with
age, reducing the productivity of adults. Intestinal helminths, among
the commonest of infections, have profound effects on the growth and
cognitive development of children. The past five years have seen
significant increases in the number of countries implementing NTD
programs and in the number of persons being treated. These increases are
 the direct result of generous donations of drugs from pharmaceutical
manufacturers and new funding support from the US Agency for
International Development (USAID) and the Department for International
Development (DFID), among others. Reducing the morbidity caused by NTDs
is an objective of the Global Health Initiative (GHI) and the global
elimination of lymphatic filariasis and trachoma are specific GHI
targets. Available diagnostic tools for lymphatic filariasis (LF),
trachoma, schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis and intestinal helminth
infections do not at present meet the needs of the control
programs.\nProject Goal: Diagnostic tests are needed to guide
programmatic decisions on community treatment for diseases addressed by
mass drug administration (MDA). Despite the molecular revolution in
biology, little of the new found knowledge of parasite genes and gene
products is being translated into tools than can be used in the field to
 guide program decisions. Tools for mapping and monitoring program
impact are still conventional parasitologic methods, based on
microscopy. These tests lack sensitivity and are not adequate for NTD
programs with elimination endpoints. New antibody tests could provide
more sensitive tools to monitor transmission, facilitate
decision-making, and conduct surveillance. The potential advantages of
antibody-based tests for post-MDA surveillance supports the efforts to
develop a standard platform therefore opening opportunities for
integrated surveillance for NTDs.\nImpact: Development of improved
diagnostic tools will address one of CDC\u2019s efforts to address
lymphatic filariasis (LF in the Americas) and the GHI targets on NTDs.
They will also enhance the commitment of donors and policy makers to the
 control and elimination programs for NTDs by providing higher quality
information and increased confidence that public health goals are being
met. Significant savings in human and financial resources could be
obtained through the development of improved diagnostic tools.",

Infections and Ensure Blood Safety",
        "description": "Background: During the past decade, several
companies have developed lateral flow immunochromatographic devices to
detect antibodies to individual communicable diseases. More recently,
these platforms have also been adapted to detect specific antigens
associated with these infections. These inexpensive point-of-care (POC)
tests offer considerable advantages over conventional laboratory tests,
since they can be performed in remote, peripheral settings with little
or no instrumentation by primary health care workers. This also allow
for counseling (and treatment if appropriate) at the initial
consultation. Point-of-care (POC) tests have been used successfully to
screen pregnant women for HIV and syphilis to prevent vertical
transmission of these infections and therefore prevent congenital
disease. In addition, in areas remote from formal, organized blood
banks, these and other POC tests have been used to screen potential
blood donors to prevent transfusion related infections. Unfortunately,
these tests are usually performed as individual tests for antibodies or
antigens for single infections. This results in a series of test strips
being run in parallel, which may have different flow characteristics,
buffers and run times that may lead to confusion and potential
inaccuracies.\nProject Goal: CDC is seeking the development of a highly
sensitive, highly specific, rapid and easy to use, disposable multiplex
immunochromatographic screening device to detect Hepatitis BsAg and
malarial antigen together with antibody to Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1
 and 2 (HIV 1\/2) and syphilis in a single finger-stick sample of whole
blood. The purpose is for screening pregnant women with the intent to
prevent vertical transmission of infection. CDC is also interested in a
single device to detect Hepatitis BsAg and malarial antigen together
with antibody to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1
 and 2 (HIV 1\/2) and syphilis in a single finger-stick sample to screen
 blood donors for transfusion-related infections in settings where
conventional laboratory facilities are not available. Optimization of
assays to detect both antibodies and specific antigens in the same
cassette device on a single specimen is strongly encouraged.\nImpact: It
 is anticipated that the development of these two multiplex
immunochromatographic test cassettes could result in a significant
reduction in rates of congenital HIV and syphilis, together with other
infections that can be transmitted from mother to child. In addition,
these tests would help make blood transfusions safer in areas where
laboratory testing is either not available, or of poor quality.",

infections with these organisms. In a 10-year period from 1997 to 2008,
over 400 cases of schistosomiasis were reported in travelers to the
international travelers\u2019 health surveillance network (GeoSentinel).
 In addition, the United States resettles 50,000-80,000 refugees
annually from around the world. It is estimated that the prevalence
rates of parasites, such as Strongyloides and Schistosoma in many
U.S.-bound refugee groups are between 20 and 40%. Diagnosis of these
infections in returning travelers and refugees in the United States is
difficult because patients often present initially with a constellation
of vague symptoms and thus, diagnoses of strongyloidiasis and
schistosomiasis typically rely on confirmatory laboratory testing. The
availability of parasitic serology testing in the United States is
limited to six commercial laboratories and the CDC reference laboratory.
 Most commercial laboratories use reagents prepared by one or two
manufacturers. To further complicate diagnosis, the reliability of these
 reagents and tests are variable and typically not FDA-cleared. To
improve laboratory diagnosis of parasitic diseases, reliable serological
 tests are needed, especially for schistosomiasis and
strongyloidiasis.\nProject Goal: CDC is particularly interested in the
development, validation, and FDA clearance of serological tests for
diagnosis of strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis. Use of recombinant

        "description": "Background: The number of people affected by
complex childhood rare conditions (CCRC), such as spina bifida (SB), is
estimated to be 1\/1500 globally. While the prevalence of these
conditions is low, they have high impact in terms of health care costs
and impact on the family and the community. Reliable and valid clinical
data are scarce and insufficient to identify and evaluate clinical
practices that lead to the best outcomes in care for these populations.
Diagnosis-specific Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) offer an important
opportunity for specific clinical populations and their providers.
Currently, most spina bifida clinics are required to enter data in both
their institution\u2019s EMR, as well as in the spina bifida electronic
medical record (SB-EMR). A software application that will eliminate
double data entry and allow each institution to maintain its electronic
medical record while also populating a diagnosis-specific record will
allow the extraction of data that can be used to measure and evaluate
quality of care. This in turn has the potential to significantly impact
the health and cost of care of people with spina bifida and other rare
disorders.\nProject Goal: CDC is seeking software that will build on the
 existing spina bifida electronic medical record (SB-EMR) being used by
19 clinics in the National Spina Bifida Patient Registry (NBSPR).
Funding will support the development of intraoperative software to
extract relevant data from an institution\u2019s legacy medical record
system and input it into the SB-EMR, significantly reducing the
resources needed to collect the condition-specific information critical
for research. Data can then be used to evaluate the effectiveness of
various treatment and prevention approaches for SB patients. Any
software product developed as a part of this proposal must follow the
Enterprise Performance Life Cycle process for project management,
producing each of the required artifacts for a gate review prior to
moving to the next stage in the process. Also, it must obtain Authority
to Operate (ATO) from the Office of the Chief Information Security
Officer (CISO), CDC.\nImpact: The proposed software tool has
applications for other health condition and clinical practices. For
example, other registries (e.g., ALS) could use this tool for recording
and tracking patient information. In addition, state and local health
departments could use a similar tool to avoid double data entry into
multiple surveillance systems. Labor and associated resources at the
clinic level could be reduced dramatically while improving the quality
of data needed to identify health care trends and best practices for
care. This project will build on the current expansion of technology and
 use of EMR as they are rapidly being implemented in health systems
across the country. If successful, the technology and tools developed
will result in a more efficient and effective data entry operation by
which clinical care and prevention can be improved.",

Surveillance",
        "description": "Background: Every year approximately 8 million
children are born worldwide with severe birth defects. Currently, data
about the magnitude of birth defects prevalence in low and middle income
 countries are either nonexistent or severely underestimated, creating
difficulties for health strategic planners to convince policy makers of
the burden and the public health impact of birth defects in their
countries. The use of smartphone technology has proven to be a useful
tool in the collection of data that is otherwise not available,
incomplete or not easy to capture. The use of smartphones is a novel,
simple, efficient and instructive approach to the collection of data and
 offers great potential for encouraging health care personnel to
contribute data using their mobile telephones. In particular, this
technology would help address a critical need in large continental areas
 like Africa, South America and East Asia where birth defect registries
are limited or do not exist and thus little is known about disease
burden and service need. Use of smartphones to establish standard global
 surveillance data will help to more accurately identify the prevalence
of birth defects and expand the reach and impact of clinical and public
health services for affected children and their families.\nProject Goal:
 CDC is seeking the development of smartphone technology for the
implementation of birth defect registries in global settings.
Application of smartphone technology has the potential to improve the
accuracy of data collection, reduce the time and the cost of data
transmission and retrieval, reduce data entry errors and synchronize
collected information with a central database. Use of smartphone
technology has the potential to address many of the issues involved in
global birth defect surveillance such as the standardization of the data
 collection process. Built-in data quality indicators can assess key
elements of data quality such as accuracy of diagnosis (providing
clinical decision support to the health provider in the field),
completeness of information of a minimal set of required variables,
geographic information systems (GIS), timeliness of data transmission,
availability of population denominator information, and evaluation of
performance. Impact: Many large countries have remote areas where the
implementation of appropriate birth defect surveillance is very
difficult. A smartphone application will strengthen surveillance by
facilitating the standardization of birth defect collection, and
storage, transmission and retrieval of data across worldwide
communities. Local providers will have access to clinical information
and guidelines for initial management of patients with birth defects. In
 addition, the technology will contribute to the awareness of the public
 health burden of birth defects, and the need for more targeted
prevention strategies leading to a positive global health impact. Once
developed, the smartphone application for birth defects registries has
the potential to be easily converted into a collection tool for other
existing epidemiological data registries with numerous uses and to
further applications for insurance companies, government entities and

remains high, particularly among racial\/ethnic minorities compared with
 many other industrialized nations. The adverse consequences of teen
pregnancy are substantial at individual, family, and community levels. A
 range of innovative tools and interventions is needed to foster an
environment that enables teens to experience better reproductive health.
 In 2011, more than one-third of US teens ages 13-17 years and over 50%
of young adults ages 18-24 years owned a smart phone. Evidence shows
that teens access the internet for reproductive health information.
Direct access to accurate, evidence-based, comprehensive, and
teen-friendly information regarding pregnancy prevention that is also
confidential and immediate can be made available with smart phone
technology. While evidence related to the public health impact of smart
phone apps is limited, similar technology-based tools, including
internet-based and text-messaging interventions, have been shown to be
effective at increasing health-related knowledge, motivation, and
behaviors.\nProject Goal: CDC is seeking the design and development of
complex mobile phone applications for multiple smart phone platforms.
The applications should be developed with input from multiple
stakeholders, including one or more leading teen pregnancy organizations
 that already maintain youth-friendly websites with relevant content.
The development of the platforms should include a marketing plan for the
 app that targets teens, caregivers, youth-serving organizations, and
health care providers. Teens and provider representatives must be
involved in the testing of smartphone platforms, in line with standard
practices in product development. The app should be interactive and
comprehensive, including information about pregnancy and pregnancy
prevention that may include quizzes, games, and other engaging means; a

        "topic_name": "Development of Nanoparticle Dengue Diagnostic
Tests",
        "description": "Background: Dengue is a major public health
problem in global tropical and subtropical areas. Primary prevention of
this mosquito vector-borne (transmitted) disease is limited because
vaccines are only in the late-stage development phase and vector control
 has been thus far unsuccessful. Dengue presents as an acute febrile
illness often without signs or symptoms that differentiate it from other
 common diseases such as influenza and leptospirosis. Some patients
progress to severe dengue near the end of their febrile period, which
can result in death. Good clinical management, early in the course of
dengue, prevents excess morbidity and mortality. Yet, early clinical
management requires accurate laboratory diagnosis to differentiate
dengue from other similar presenting diseases (e.g., influenza,
leptospirosis).  Until recently, dengue diagnostic testing was
problematic because most patients present during the first days after
onset of fever. Dengue virus (DENV) detection in serum is the only way
to make the diagnosis, but anti-DENV IgM levels usually do not reach
measurable levels until the critical phase. While molecular testing
identifies most persons with dengue, this method is not widely available
 in developing countries where the disease is endemic. In addition, a
soluble non-structural antigen (NS1) can be detected by immunoassay
during this period, but is not as sensitive as molecular
tests.\nNanoparticle-based technology significantly increases the
sensitivity of antigen and antibody detection tests and can be used for
molecular diagnostics and in multiplex formats. Microresonator
constructs and nanowire-based field effect transistors allow this
technology to detect biolytes at low femtomolar concentrations. Surface
enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and extrinsic Raman labels (ERLs) have
been used with metal nanoparticles (gold, silver) organic reporter
molecules to magnify the Raman response by ~106, which surpasses
fluorescence.\nProject Goal: To develop prototype dengue diagnostic
tests that identify DENV by either molecular or immuno-detector systems
(e.g., DENV specific nucleic acid, NS1 and E antigen) using
nanoparticle-based technology that includes but is not limited to SERS
and ERLs. The prototype test(s) should be developed as a biochip with a
product profile that is amenable to a short-turn-around diagnostic
result for use in resource constrained settings. Prototype test(s) would
 be judged as \u2018acceptable\u2019 if they detect a high proportion of
 dengue cases during the early phase of the febrile illness across all
DENV serotypes, in primary and secondary infections and do not
cross-react or misdiagnose other flavivirus infections or infections due
 to other causes of febrile illness that present with signs and symptoms
 similar to dengue.\nImpact: The availability of dengue diagnostic tests
 with high sensitivity and specificity that detect DENV infection soon
after the onset of fever would greatly change the public health impact
of current secondary prevention activities by improving clinical
outcomes, and would provide the basis for evaluation of dengue vaccines
following introduction. The market for dengue diagnostic tests has not
been estimated, however, it is estimated that 40-60% of the world\u2019s
 population reside in dengue endemic areas of the world (i.e., 100%
cases of dengue are reported annually). Thus, one would expect there
would be a many-fold great market for these tests each year.",

 present with clinical symptoms similar to those of other bacterial or
viral infections, such as a flu-like illness, encephalitis, or
polio-like myelitis. Laboratory diagnosis is essential to determine
etiology and calculate disease burden in order to guide treatment and
control strategies, particularly if there is an effective vaccine
available, such as for yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis. Detection
 of virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody in an enzyme-linked
immunosorbant assay (MAC-ELISA) is the standard serological test for
diagnosis of acute arbovirus infections. However, diagnostic tests are
not available for many of these \u201cneglected\u201d but medically
important arboviral diseases in resource poor laboratories. Samples must
 be sent to reference laboratories for testing, which delays diagnosis
and reduces the number of laboratory-confirmed cases.
\u201cIn-house\u201d assays developed in reference laboratories are
unsuitable for use in laboratories with limited technical capacity, due
to the lack of standardized reagents and format.\nProject Goal: The goal
 of this project is the development of a laboratory test based on IgM
detection to diagnose arboviral infections in a standardized kit format.
 A prototype yellow fever virus MAC- ELISA should be developed initially
 showing proof-of-concept. The developed assays should have the
characteristics of simplicity and robustness as described by the World
Health Organization. The format should be designed so that the assay can
 easily be modified to test for other arboviruses by switching out a
limited number of standardized and validated reagents and controls. The
variation, reproducibility, and accuracy of the test should be
characterized and benchmarked against current tests. Suitability of the
test for use in resource-limited surveillance laboratories should be
demonstrated.\nImpact: The test is meant to be a screening test used at
primary health care level. A rapid diagnostic test is essential to
support vaccination and surveillance programs by increasing the number
of biologically confirmed cases, thus improving the accuracy of disease
burden estimates. These data will in turn improve the effectiveness of
vaccine programs for vaccine-preventable diseases such as yellow fever.
The primary benefit of such diagnostics is intended for resource-poor
countries. Such rapid arbovirus diagnostics can be incorporated into
resource-poor countries as laboratory capacity-building
efforts.\nInnovative approaches such as \u201cdipstick\u201d technology
that can be used in the clinic and the field are already being employed
by manufacturers of commercial diagnostic assays for other medically
important infectious diseases. Rapid diagnostics is an area that should
be of particular interest to small business concerns. Laboratories in
developing countries have either no alternative methods or only
elaborate and inefficient methods to diagnose arbovirus infections at
this time, a gap which a small business has the opportunity to fill.",

combatting of antibiotic resistance in the pathogens causing these
infections are national public health priorities as demonstrated in
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) national action plans.
Public reporting of HAIs by hospitals using the National Healthcare
Safety Network (NHSN) is mandated in over half of all states and the
number of states is increasing annually. The public reporting of three
HAIs is currently incentivized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services and this program is slated to expand dramatically in coming
years. Meanwhile, as the crisis of antibiotic resistance continues to

preserve remaining drug activity. Electronic data submission provides
the best method for meeting increasing informational needs while
containing the costs of public reporting. Already several hundred
hospitals are submitting electronic data to NHSN to meet present and
future mandates for public reporting.\nProject Goal: To develop a
technical prototype for summarizing antimicrobial resistance data (as
outlined on the NHSN website) using a laboratory or infection control
information system and reporting to NHSN within the CDC clinical
document architecture specifications

antimicrobial resistance data to NHSN, therefore providing risk adjusted
 resistance patterns to guide infection prevention and antimicrobial
stewardship activities at a facility. Infection control information
systems and laboratory information systems that enable such electronic
reporting will consider this functionality an attractive option to
hospitals to comply with state mandates on reporting and adhering to
emerging federal policies in this arena. If the experience of reporting
HAI data electronically from vendor systems to NHSN is any indication,

Durable Protective Immunity against HIV",
        "description": "Background: Substantial progress has been made
recently towards identifying effective HIV prevention strategies. The
RV144 trial demonstrated that an HIV vaccine comprised of a recombinant
ALVAC prime + gp120 boost regimen was partially efficacious (VE=31.2%),
although it\u2019s protective effects waned over the study period and
study volunteers faced barriers related to transportation to clinic for
the required multiple injections with vaccine. Thus, there is an urgent
need to identify innovative approaches to elicit or to boost HIV
vaccine-elicited immunity, via simplified immunization regimens. If
identified, these approaches have the potential to increase the
durability of vaccine-mediated protection against HIV acquisition. Use
of platforms to sustainably deliver HIV vaccine antigens, which could
also incorporate delivery of antiretroviral drugs, would potentially
allow for co-delivery of biomedical preventions for HIV.\nProject Goal:
The goal of this project is to stimulate research and development of
biomedical devices that elicit durable protective immunity against HIV.
Specific areas of research interest include the development of novel
devices to achieve sustained delivery of HIV vaccine antigens to mucosal
 surfaces for the purpose of priming antiviral immune responses and\/or
boosting prior vaccine-elicited immune responses with the goal of
increasing the duration of protective immunity against HIV as well as
reducing the need for multiple visits to a provider. Development of
products based upon platforms that have (1) demonstrated high levels of
safety, acceptance and adherence in human usage for sustained delivery
(e.g. implants, vaginal rings) and (2) intrinsic flexibility for
advanced development to incorporate co-delivery of antiretroviral
compounds, other HIV microbicides, vaccine adjuvants, or hormonal
contraceptives are highly encouraged.\nThe expected end-product is the
design and construction of a device that could be used in humans to
achieve sustained delivery of HIV vaccine antigens to mucosal surfaces
and that is suitable for efficacy assessment in a relevant non-human
primate model. It would be expected that there would be documentation
providing a detailed description of all testing results, including ex
vivo characterization of the device as well as pre-clinical assessment
protocols and a preliminary efficacy trial design (including statistical
 power estimates).\nImpact: Globally, more than 2.6 million new HIV
infections occur each year (&gt;50,000 in the US). As such, the need for
 efficacious biomedical preventions is needed to complement existing
behavioral interventions. Products determined to be efficacious under
this proposed evaluation have enormous market potential in HIV
prevention.",

Determination of Recent HIV-1 Infection",
        "description": "Background: The estimation of HIV incidence, or
the rate of new infections in a population, is an important public
health indicator that provides valuable information on the growth of the
 epidemic and the efficacy of various intervention strategies. Within
the past 15 years, a new strategy for estimating HIV incidence has been
employed based on the observation that certain biomarkers (mainly
HIV-specific antibody levels and avidity) can distinguish recent from
long-term infection. Since the immune response to HIV gradually develops
 post-infection, the immune profile of newly infected individuals will
present differently from the immune profile of individuals with chronic
infection. Although several laboratory tests have been developed for the
 purpose of identifying recent infection, most approaches rely on a
single assay measure. Relying on a single measure of the immune response
 is subject to greater misclassification due to inherent immune
variation among individuals. Recent studies have shown that a
combination of antibody responses or immune measures may reduce
misclassification rates and improve incidence estimates. Ideally,
multiple immune responses should be measured in a single assay, since it
 is not always feasible or cost effective to require several different
tests for accurate incidence estimates.\nProject Goal: The goal of the
proposed project is to develop a portable and cost-effective assay that
is capable of measuring multiple immune responses at the same time
(multiplexing). The assay should be able to provide a quantitative or
semi-quantitative measure of HIV-specific antibody levels and avidity to
 multiple antigens using a relatively small volume of plasma (\u2264
20\u03bcl). The assay should be similar in sensitivity to HIV
antibody-based tests that are currently commercially available. While
several technologies with multiplexing capability do exist, there are
some limitations to the assay formats, as they are typically costly,
technically complicated, and not accessible to all testing settings\/
laboratories. The technology should be a portable, high-throughput, and a
 scalable multiplexing platform for determining recent
infection.\nImpact: The availability of a low-cost, portable assay that
can measure multiple HIV-specific biomarkers will enhance accessibility
to diverse laboratory or field settings, enabling large-scale use of HIV
 incidence by various public health entities to chart their respective
epidemics. The platform may also be suitable for other infectious
disease diagnostics.",

Prevention Strategies in Nonhuman Primates",
        "description": "Background: Although substantial progress has
been made to identify new biomedical HIV prevention strategies,
including topical and oral antiretroviral drug pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP) regimens and vaccines, they are not yet approved for general use.
 However, these preventions (or related derivatives) are likely to be
implemented widely in upcoming years. The identification of HIV
preventions such as these, despite being only partially efficacious,
offer an opportunity for small companies with flexible portfolios to
consider the possibility of combining novel or existing biomedical
preventions to generate a high probability for complete
protection.\nBecause future clinical trials of HIV vaccines will likely
incorporate control arms that include PrEP, there is also a need to
model whether such combinations may result in additive, synergistic,
neutral or even subtractive effects. Non-human primate modeling, to
determine the efficacy and interactions of combinations of two partially
 effective, clinically relevant HIV biomedical prevention approaches,
can directly inform clinical trial design and impact the implementation
of biomedical preventions against HIV.  Project Goal: The long-term goal
 of this project is to determine, in non-human primates, whether two
biomedical HIV preventions, such as vaccines and PrEP, may be combined
to achieve additive or synergistic protective efficacy. Proposals are
sought where small businesses will combine biomedical preventions, such
as vaccines and drugs that are known to have efficacy (complete or
partial), to prevent HIV infection in humans or animal models of HIV. In
 the event that one or both prevention modalities do not have extensive
prior assessment in non-human primates or human clinical trials,
demonstration of safety and scalability is of primary importance. Safety
 testing can include use of in vitro or small animal model testing.
Proposals should include plans for the design, construction and
characterization of prevention modalities suitable for efficacy
assessments of the combination of partially effective interventions in a
 relevant non-human primate model. Proposals should also document a
detailed description of the prevention modalities and pre-clinical
assessment protocols.\nImpact: Globally, more than 2.6 million new HIV
infections occur each year (&gt;50,000 in the US). As such, the need for
 efficacious biomedical preventions is urgently needed to complement
existing behavioral interventions. This mechanism specifically enables
small businesses to rapidly conduct relevant pre-clinical evaluation of
combined HIV prevention products in a nonhuman primate model that
presages the changing landscape of domestic HIV prevention trials to
incorporate PrEP as a standard of care. Combined HIV prevention products
 in a nonhuman primate model could facilitate the identification of the
most promising HIV prevention solutions early in the developmental
pipeline, which would accelerate the pace at which they are translated
into effective products to prevent HIV infections.",

        "topic_name": "Development of an Inactivated Rotavirus Vaccine
for Use in Global Immunization",
        "description": "Background: The currently licensed oral
rotavirus vaccines Rotarix\u2122 and Rotateq\u2122 are effective in
reducing cases of severe diarrhea among children in high and middle
income countries, but are significantly less effective in low income
countries. In addition, both vaccines are associated with a low risk of
diarrhea and intussusception among infants who receive the first dose of
 vaccine. To improve the safety and efficacy of oral rotavirus vaccines,
 CDC scientists have developed a proprietary inactivated rotavirus
vaccine (IRV) technology (new human strains and a novel method for
rotavirus inactivation) and demonstrated the immunogenicity in mice and
protective efficacy in piglets of this IRV by intramuscular (IM)
administration.\nCDC has demonstrated good immunogenicity of the IRV
using an innovative microneedle patch technology, achieving comparable
antibody titers with a 1\/10th of the antigen dose compared to those
induced by a full IM dose of vaccine. Microneedles provide a simple and
painless method to administer vaccines without using hypodermic needles.
 They are inexpensive to manufacture and may not need the cold chain, a
major advantage for immunization campaigns in the developing world. The
findings from this study may allow us to enhance public health through
the development of a low cost vaccine with an improved safety and
efficacy profile and thus help achieve and sustain global immunization
initiatives such as rotavirus vaccines.  Project Goal: With the
establishment of proof of concept for intramuscular and skin
immunization in animals, the CDC has licensed the technology to a number
 of vaccine manufacturers in the US and emerging developing countries
for scale-up and clinical development as a stand-alone IRV first and
then a combined pediatric vaccine. However, phase 1 safety data in the
country of origin (USA in this case) is a prerequisite for vaccine
manufacturers in developing countries to receive approval from their
national regulatory agencies for clinical trials of a new vaccine. To
meet this requirement, the goal of this project is to propose several
specific research areas of interest, (1) production of a Vero cell bank,
 (2) production of two rotavirus seed banks and, (3) preparation of two
pilot vaccine lots under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions in
 partnership with a contract manufacturing organization (CMO). Pilot
lots will include the preparation of an injectable IM vaccine first and
microneedle patches for skin immunization, if enough funding is
available.\nImpact: Availability of GMP materials and phase I safety
data will provide the opportunity to move this project forward, working
with partners, to jointly develop this new and innovative IRV for use in
 children throughout the world. In long term, this IRV can be combined
with other pediatric vaccines, such as IPV. Due to the parenteral
administration, IRV will be equally effective in all settings, help save
 more lives, and ultimately increase global health impact through large
immunization campaigns.",

Sublingual Administration",
        "description": "Background: Vaccines are one of the most
powerful tools available for preventing disease. Measles vaccine has led
 to the elimination of endemic measles from the Western Hemisphere and a
 tremendous reduction in global mortality. However, the logistic
difficulties inherent in vaccination by injection create barriers to
high measles vaccine coverage. Vaccination by injection requires highly
skilled vaccinators, maintenance of an expensive cold-chain, vaccine
reconstitution with risks of contamination and bio-waste disposal of
millions of syringes and needles to prevent reuse or injuries.
Needle-free vaccine delivery would lower these barriers and expand the
benefits of vaccination to a larger at-risk population.\nProject Goal:
Although sublingual drug delivery has been used for years, only recently
 has research begun to demonstrate the potential of sublingual vaccine
delivery. Proposals are solicited for the development of a thermostable
dry measles vaccine formulation to be administered sublingually in a
melting tablet, wafer or strip format. The goal of this project is the
development of the thermostability of the vaccine formulation in the
selected format with &lt; 1 log titer loss after 6 months at 37\u2070 C
and a clear demonstration of immunogenicity in a small animal model
(i.e., cotton rat).\nImpact: A thermostable sublingual measles vaccine
would lower barriers to vaccination, especially in the developing world,
 by reducing the skill level required to vaccinate, eliminating cold
chain requirements and the risks associated with reconstitution and
injection. Dry sublingual vaccine would reduce shipping costs, cold
chain costs and the direct cost of syringe and needles as well as many
hidden costs (e.g., costs of vaccinator training, sharps disposal,
disease from needle reuse or injury).",

        "description": "Background: CDC has both domestic and
international laboratory programs that provide clinical specimen testing
 for the detection of known and emerging infections, chemical, or
radiological agents that pose global health threats. Current methods for
 collection, storage, and transport of biological specimens are
expensive and labor and material intensive. Clinical specimens are often
 collected by highly trained phlebotomists and other health
professionals, transported to laboratories in compliance with shipping
regulations for potentially infectious specimens, and shipped cold chain
 to ensure specimen integrity. There is a need for novel, minimally
invasive, low-complexity specimen collection, and preservation
technologies.\nProject Goal: CDC is interested in improving capabilities
 in low-complexity methods to collect, preserve, and safely transport
clinically relevant specimens or samples for endemic\/outbreak
surveillance and chemical or radionuclide exposure. Additionally, these
technologies could translate well to low resource settings or home
health care environments. High quality proposals must address the
following priority area and preference will be given to proposals that
can address any additional areas of interest. Specifically excluded is
research that only incrementally advances the current state of the art.
Proposals that aim to simply integrate existing methods and technologies
 will be considered non-responsive.\nPriority Area of
Interest:\nTechnologies\/methods that allow for the self-collection of
blood specimens in all point of care\/contact settings without the
necessity for trained personnel, require minimal materials\/reagents,
yet maintain the integrity of either nucleic acids (DNA and RNA),
protein analytes (antigens, enzyme, and antibody), or both, at ambient
temperature (0-40oC) for \u226514 days, and allow for inexpensive
storage and transportation.\nNucleic acids and\/or protein analytes must
 be compatible\/interoperable with downstream assays including
functional (activity) assays, real-time PCR, real-time RT-PCR, ELISA,
sequencing, mass spectroscopy, and serology, as appropriate.\nAdditional
 Areas of interest:\nCompatibility of the technologies\/methods with
additional biological specimens (e.g., serum, sputum, nasopharyngeal
swabs\/aspirates, whole blood or urine).\nWhen warranted, inactivation
of infectious agents by methods that do not interfere with
detection\/measurement of the diagnostic target, to allow laboratory
testing under BSL2 conditions.\nSuitability for testing a broad range of
 target analytes (including but not limited to, antibodies, antigens,
cytokines, enzymes, carbohydrates, small molecules, metals,
radionuclides, lipids, and nucleic acids) at clinically relevant
concentrations.  Potential for FDA clearance or CLIA waiver for use with
 diagnostics in low resource settings, patient homes, and first
responder use, Potential for Point of Care or Point of Need settings or
laboratory environments.\nImpact: Improved capabilities for specimen or
sample collection, preservation, inactivation, and transportation will
result in faster laboratory testing, reduce public health costs, and
improve testing capabilities in low complexity settings. The impact of
this initiative is broadly applicable to many CDC\u2019s \u201cWinnable
Battles\u201d including HIV, food safety, obesity, achieving and
sustaining global immunization goals, and eliminating lymphatic
filariasis in the Americas. In addition, this improved capability will
support core CDC surveillance programs such as the National Health and

National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System. New technologies resulting
from this project have commercialization potential within the growing

DFRC, GRC\n\nNASA is concerned with the prevention of encounters with
hazardous in-flight conditions and the mitigation of their effects when
they do occur.  Hazardous flight conditions of particular interest are:
wake vortices, clear-air turbulence, in-flight icing, lightning, and low
 visibility.  NASA is interested in new and innovative methods for
detection, identification, evaluation, and monitoring of in-flight
hazards to aviation.  In the case of lightning, interest is centered on
the mitigation and in-flight measurement of lightning damage,
particularly to composite aircraft.  \n\nNASA seeks to foster research
and development that leads to innovative new technologies and methods,
or significant improvements in existing technologies, for in-flight
hazard avoidance and mitigation.  Technologies may take the form of
tools, models, techniques, procedures, substantiated guidelines,
prototypes, and devices.   Proposed products may be for retrofit into
current aircraft or for installation in future aircraft.  Both manned
and unmanned aircraft are of interest.\n\nA key objective of the NASA
Aviation Safety Program is to support the research of technology,
systems, and methods that will facilitate transformation of the National
 Airspace System to Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen)
(information available at www.jpdo.gov).  The general approach to the
development of airborne sensors for NextGen is to encourage the
development of multi-use, adaptable, and effective sensors that will
have a strong benefit to safety.  The greatest impact will result from
improved sensing capability in the terminal area, where higher density
and more reliable operations are required for NextGen.\n\nUnder this
subtopic, proposals are invited that explore new and improved sensors
and sensor systems for the detection and monitoring of hazards to
aircraft before they are encountered. With regard to hazardous lightning
 conditions, the emphasis is not on remote detection, but rather on
developing systems that make aircraft more robust in a lightning
environment or provide in-flight damage assessment or other hazard
mitigating benefits.  The scope of this subtopic does not include human
factors and focused development of human interfaces, including displays
and alerts.  Primary emphasis is on airborne applications, but in some
cases the development of ground-based sensor technology may be
supported.  Approaches that use multiple sensors in combination to
improve hazard detection and quantification of hazard levels are also of
 interest.\n\nAreas of particular interest to NASA at this time are
described in more detail below.  The list and details are provided as
encouragement but are not intended to exclude other proposals that fit
the scope of this subtopic. \n\nTurbulence and Wake
Vortex\n\n\u2022\tRemote detection of kinetic air hazards - The class of
 hazards including wake vortices, turbulence, and other hazards
associated with air motion is referred to as kinetic air hazards.
Within this class, wakes and turbulence are the highest priorities;
however, NASA is particularly interested in sensor systems that can
detect multiple hazards and thus provide greater utility.  For example,
air data systems are at times disabled by icing, and a multi-function,
multi-hazard sensor that includes a robust alternative air data source
would be a great asset in such conditions.\n\u2022\tAirborne detection
of wake vortices -Airborne detection of wake vortices is considered
challenging due to the fact that detection must be possible in nearly
all weather conditions, in order to be practical, and because of the
size and nature of the phenomena.  In particular, NASA is interested in
the ability to detect and measure wake vortex hazards for arbitrary
viewing angles.\n\u2022\tAirborne detection of turbulence -NASA has made
 a major investment in the development of new and enhanced technologies
to enable detection of turbulence to improve aviation safety. Progress
has been made in efforts to quantify hazard levels from convectively
induced turbulence events and to make these quantitative assessments
available to civil and commercial aviation. NASA is interested in
expanding these prior efforts to take advantage of the newly developing
turbulence monitoring technologies, particularly those focused on clear
air turbulence (CAT). NASA welcomes proposals that explore the methods,
algorithms and quantitative assessment of turbulence for the purpose of
increasing aviation safety and augmenting currently available data in
support of NextGen operations. \n\nLightning\n\n\u2022\tLightning Strike
 Protection - NASA is investigating means for mitigating damage to
aircraft, with a particular interest in protecting composite aircraft.
Currently, an electrically-conductive screen protects composite aircraft
 by functioning as a Faraday shield and is intended to confine lightning
 and electromagnetic effects to the outside or outermost skin of the
aircraft.  The lightning strike protection system, hereafter referred to
 as the LSP, is incorporated in the coatings, layers, and structure that
 comprise the skin of the aircraft.  NASA is most interested in LSP
solutions that will be cost effective and
light-weight.\n\u2022\tMitigation of lightning strike damage - NASA is
seeking solutions that will provide better protection from lightning
damage by directing attachment points or lightning currents to safe or
less hazardous areas and by reducing the susceptibility of the aircraft
to thermal or other damage due to strikes.\n\u2022\tIn-flight lightning
damage measurement and assessment - A typical commercial aircraft is
struck by lightning about once per year.  At this time, composite
aircraft that are struck in-flight are inspected upon landing for a
damage assessment. Such assessments may be time-consuming and difficult.
  Innovations that will provide a measurement or damage detection system
 in the LSP are solicited.  The objective would be to achieve a
capability to have damage detection and assessment capability in the
aircraft that will provide immediate information to the flight crew
after a lightning attachment.\n",

        "topic_name": "Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration into the
National Airspace System Research",
        "description": "Lead Center: DFRC\nParticipating Center(s): ARC,
 GRC, LaRC\n\nThe following subtopic is in support of the Unmanned
Aircraft Systems (UAS) Integration in the National Airspace System (NAS)
 Project under the Integrated Systems Research Program (ISRP). There is
an increasing need to fly UAS in the NAS to perform missions of vital
importance to National Security and Defense, Emergency Management,
Science, and to enable commercial applications. The UAS Integration in
the NAS Project is structured under the following technical challenges:
\n\n\u2022\tAirspace Integration - validate technologies and procedures
for UAS to remain an appropriate distance from other aircraft, and to
safely and routinely interoperate with NAS and NextGen Air Traffic
Services (ATS).\n\u2022\tStandards\/Regulations - validate minimum
system and operational performance standards and certification
requirements and procedures for UAS to safely operate in the
NAS.\n\u2022\tRelevant Test Environment - develop an adaptable,
scalable, and schedulable relevant test environment for validating
concepts and technologies for UAS to safely operate in the NAS. The
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations are built upon the
condition of a pilot being in an aircraft. \n\nThere exist few, if any,
regulations specifically addressing UAS today. The primary user of UAS
to date has been the military. The technologies and procedures to enable
 seamless operation and integration of UAS in the NAS need to be
developed, validated, and employed by the FAA through rule making and
policy development.\n\nThe Project goal is to capitalize on NASA\u2019s
unique capabilities and competencies by utilizing integrated system
level tests in a relevant environment to eliminate or reduce critical
technical barriers of integrating UAS into the NAS. The project is
further broken down into five subprojects: Separation Assurance\/Sense
and Avoid Interoperability (SSI); Communications; Human Systems
Integration; Certification; and Integrated Test and Evaluation. The
fifth sub-project, Integrated Test and Evaluation, is responsible for
developing a live, virtual, and constructive test environment for the
other four subprojects. The first phase of the project includes the
following: \n\n\u2022\tConduct initial modeling, simulation, and flight
testing.\n\u2022\tComplete early subproject-focused deliverables
(spectrum requirements, comparative analysis of certification
methodologies, etc.).\n\u2022\tValidate the key technical elements
identified by this project. \n\nThe second phase includes the following:
 \n\n\u2022\tConduct systems-level, integrated testing of concepts
and\/or capabilities that address barriers to routine access to the
NAS.\n\u2022\tProvide methodologies for development of airworthiness
requirements and data to support development of certification standards
and regulatory guidance.\n\u2022\tDevelop a body of evidence (including
validated data, algorithms, analysis, and recommendations) to support
key decision makers in establishing policy, procedures, standards and
regulations, enabling routine UAS access in the NAS.\n\nThis
solicitation seeks proposals, but is not limited, to
develop:\n\n\u2022\tCertified control and non-payload communications
(CNPC) system - Current civil UAS operations are significantly
constrained by the lack of a standardized, certified control and
non-payload communications (CNPC) system. The UAS CNPC system is to
provide communications functions between the Unmanned Aircraft (UA) and
the UA ground control station for such applications as: telecommands;
non-payload telemetry; navigation aid data; air traffic control (ATC)
voice relay; air traffic services (ATS) data relay; sense and avoid data
 relay; airborne weather radar data; and non-payload situational
awareness video. New and innovative approaches to providing terrestrial
and space-based high-bandwidth CNPC systems that are inexpensive, small,
 low latency, reliable, and secure offer opportunities for quantum jumps
 in UAS utility and capabilities. Of particular interest are:
\no\tTechnologies for High power C-band amplifiers and highly linear
C-band power amplifiers\/linearization of high power C-band
amplifiers.\no\tMiniaturization of C-band radio
components\/systems.\n\u2022\tA \u201cSynthetic Vision System\u201d for a
 ground control station (GCS) - Integration of display technology that
presents the visual environment external to the unmanned aircraft using
computer-generated imagery in a manner analogous to how it would appear
to the pilot in a manned aircraft. A \u201csynthetic vision system\u201d
 displays critical features of the environment external to the aircraft
through a computer-generated image of the external scene topography
using terrain and obstacle databases. Several research and technological
 developments have made synthetic vision systems possible.
Fundamentally, these systems require only precise ownship location, a
database, available graphics and computing capability and display media.
 In terms of safety benefits, synthetic vision may help to reduce many
accident precursors including: Loss of awareness of vertical\/ lateral
path, terrain traffic, etc. Operational benefits may include transition
from instruments to visual flight, non-normal and emergency situations,
virtual visual self-spacing and station keeping capability, etc. SVS
have been extensively studied and there is a vast body of knowledge on
their application to manned aviation. Special interest is in the
integration of a SVS into a UA ground control station to support
operator in the loop, sense and avoid (SAA) functions for UAS operations
 in the NAS. Guidelines for sense and avoid requirements and functions
are currently being developed by standards organizations (e.g., RTCA
SC-203) and the FAA.\n\u2022\tWeather information systems for GCS -
On-board, real-time graphic aviation weather information products have
been developed and successfully implemented for manned cockpits. Their
use is now widespread and their safety impact widely recognized. The
applicability of such products for operators and ground control pilots
to enhance situation awareness and improve mission planning and
execution is of interest to NASA. Systems such as the NASA developed
Aviation Weather Information (AWIN) system that included software, data
and data-link applications, color weather graphics such as
composite-radar mosaic, lightning-strike data, wind data, satellite
images and forecasts could be integrated into a ground control station
to provide pilots with weather awareness before and during mission
execution. Improved weather awareness should allow aircrews to avoid
most weather-related problems through both pre-flight and en-route
planning. While the use of these systems has been explored for military
UAS operations, their applicability to civil and public operations has
not yet been explored.\n\u2022\tOperator Displays for Sense and Avoid
Systems - While guidelines for the integration of UAS operations in the
NAS are being developed new SAA systems are being designed to provide
the ground control pilot with situation awareness and the ability to
execute required ATC procedures. SAA systems provide UAS with the
capability to avoid collisions and remain well clear of other aircraft
by means of sensor systems and equipment specifically designed for this
purpose. SAA systems consist of surveillance sensors, data
communications, threat detection and\/or resolution logic and the
display of traffic information and\/or resolution guidance\/advice. Of
interest is the development of display technologies to enable ground
control pilots to participate in any phase of the SAA process as
indicated by operator procedures. These new technologies should utilize
the vast experience and body of knowledge developed over the years for
airborne\/ground separation assurance systems, TCAS displays, and
cockpit displays of traffic information. In addition, these new displays
 will exhibit unique and very challenging new problems associated with
the nature of unmanned systems as well as the communication latencies
and potential safety risks of failure conditions. Human factors
considerations should be applied in the design of these
systems.\n\u2022\tLost Communication Link Procedures and Operations -
The procedures followed by unmanned aircraft and their pilots when the
command and control link is lost with the ground station are not
standardized and frequently do not take into account ATC regulations.
Each UAS appears to have custom-designed procedures for \u201clost
link\u201d despite the existence of well-established rules for pilots to
 follow when communication capability is lost. Research should establish
 a desired set of procedures to be followed that parallel the existing
requirements, but departing from those where necessary to meet critical
safety considerations. These procedures may be codified in technologies
used by the unmanned aircraft or the pilot in the ground control station
 to maximize the predictability of the UAS\u2019 actions from an ATC
perspective.\n\u2022\tSafety Analysis and Methodologies - UAS operations
 are untried in the civil NAS. Unlike other aircraft, there is not an
extensive record of civil operations upon which to forecast the safety
of UAS operations in the NAS. The introduction of UAS into the NAS
raises many safety issues and concerns. Typically, anytime a new
capability is added into the NAS, an Operational Safety Assessment (OSA)
 is performed by the FAA, to determine whether that introduction of new
capability will enhance or detract from the safety of the NAS. As these
UAS represent a wholly new operational system, traditional approaches
cannot suffice. Research is needed to identify and develop new safety
analysis approaches, as well as prognostic indicators and potential new
safety metrics.\n",

        "description": "Lead Center: LaRC\n\nMaterials and Structural
Concepts for Aeroelastically-Tailored Aircraft Wings\n\nThe Fixed Wing
and High Speed projects are focused on development of enabling
technologies and advanced concepts for subsonic and supersonic cruise
transport category aircraft, respectively, demonstrated to TRL 4-6 in
the 2025 time frame. Both projects require simultaneous reduction of
weight and drag to achieve their respective performance objectives. For
subsonic transport aircraft, lift-induced drag is approximately 40% of
the total drag at cruise and can be directly addressed via increased
wing aspect ratio. For supersonic flight, speed requirements dictate
highly swept wings with a very thin airfoil section. Both of these wing
geometries, with higher aspect ratio or thinner airfoil section, result
in more flexible structure that can exhibit aeroelastic instability and
thus require more complicated aeroelastic design, analysis and control.
The traditional solution to these aeroelastic issues has been primarily
to stiffen the wing by adding additional structure, thus creating a
weight penalty. Solutions that favorably modify the aeroelastic response
 of thin or high aspect ratio wings with no or little weight increase
are needed. Furthermore, maneuverability of the vehicle is dependent
upon the control authority achievable by wing-located control surfaces
in traditional aircraft designs, and possibly actively tailorable
portions of wings in more integrated aircraft designs. Designing the
wing to have desired aeroelastic characteristics makes the wing amenable
 to minimal-input active control solutions to further modify the
aeroelastic response. Using a building block approach in this research
topic, the current solicitation focuses on materials and structural
concepts for aeroelastically-tailored aircraft wings, while the more
complex aeroservoelastic solution will be the subject of a future
solicitation.\n\nThis solicitation topic seeks innovative materials
and\/or structural concepts and technologies for lightweight wings with
aeroelastic tailoring, such as tailored bending and torsional stiffness
as an example. Proposals should involve novel materials, processes and
structural concepts with significant potential to improve the structural
 efficiency and reduce specific weight. Laboratory scale approaches may
be proposed for proof of concept, but must be scalable to application
across a broad range of fixed wing aircraft sizes and
speeds.\n\nTailored stiffness may include spatial or temporal variations
 in stiffness achieved by a combination of passive stiffness tailoring
of anisotropic or functionally graded materials, novel structural
topologies, or active integrated elements to change structural and\/or
material properties. The use of existing design and analysis tools and
techniques to the greatest extent possible is encouraged, as it is not
the intent of this solicitation to develop new computational tools.
Specifically, the following concepts and technologies are
sought:\n\n\u2022\tMaterials and processing routes to fabricate
engineered materials with tailored material properties along all three
axes.\n\u2022\tAeroelastically-tailored structural concepts by which
desired static or dynamic aeroelastic responses can be
achieved.\n\nPhase I: Identify candidate material systems and structural
 concepts that enable aeroelastic tailoring of wing structure for
reduced weight, for example, variable bending and torsional stiffness.
Assess the feasibility and benefits of the proposed concept, including
scale-up, necessary material property quantification, and design trade
studies. The studies must include quantification of expected structural
weight benefits. Identify limiting factors and recommendations for
further technology development to address the shortfalls. For novel
material systems and structural concepts requiring development, conduct
initial proof of concept computational studies and\/or element
tests.\n\nPhase II: Perform scale-up of materials and processes as
necessary, and produce a detailed structural design and hardware build
of a subscale wing suitable for laboratory testing to assess structural
performance of the concept. Structural testing of the subscale wing will
 be performed subsequently by NASA and is beyond the scope of the Phase
II effort.\n",

        "topic_name": "Aerodynamic Efficiency- Drag Reduction
Technology",
        "description": "Lead Center: LaRC\n\nThe challenge of
energy-efficient flight has at its foundation aerodynamic efficiency,
and at the foundation of aerodynamic efficiency is low drag.  Drag can
be broadly decomposed into four components: viscous or skin friction
drag, lift-induced drag, wave or compressibility drag, and excrescence
drag due to various protruding items such as antennae, wipers, lights,
etc.   The relative impact of these four forces depends upon the
targeted flight regime and vehicle-specific design requirements.  The
first force, however, viscous skin friction, stands out as particularly
significant across most classes of flight vehicles and effective
measures for its control would have a major impact on flight efficiency.
 In particular, supersonic, low-boom flight and new generations of
energy-efficient subsonic transport airplanes including high L\/D
strut-braced designs, the blended wing body (BWB), the so called
\u201cdouble-bubble\u201d designs and other concepts with large expanses
 of surface area would benefit from effective viscous drag control.
\n\nViscous skin friction can be classified as either laminar or
turbulent.  While the laminar case and its attendant laminar flow
control (LFC) techniques remain important scientific and technological
disciplines, the goal of high Reynolds number flight efficiency requires
 that the turbulent case receive renewed attention.  In place of the
first-principles-derived theoretical framework of the laminar flow
stability problem, in the turbulence case we have a wide collection of
experimental observations, data correlations, various CFD approaches
requiring turbulence closure models and, at low Reynolds numbers, full
direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations (DNS).
While such experimental and CFD-derived knowledge, has greatly increased
 our understanding of turbulent boundary layer physics over the past
decades, key relationships between wall layer and outer layer dynamics
essential to a full understanding remain to be identified and
verified.\n\nInadequacies in our understanding of boundary layer
turbulence increase reliance upon a more qualitative, physics-guided
approach to discovery.  For example, the experimental observation of
reduced skin friction in the corners of triangular cross-section pipes
led to the discovery of drag-reducing V-groove riblets (subsequently
also associated with the skin of certain shark species).  The
quasi-periodic, low-speed streak structures observed in the near-wall
layer of turbulent boundary layers led to the implementation of
mechanically controlled spanwise waves or lateral oscillations of the
wall to disrupt the processes associated with low speed streak bursting.
 Similar observations have either been made or suggested with respect to
 the stabilizing influence of convex and in-plane curvature; long
length-to-diameter ratio particulates; passive, active and reactive wall
 motion; manipulation of the wall layer by various geometrical devices
(e.g., vortex generators (VG) and large eddy breakup devices (LEBU)),
and various weakly ionized gas (WIG) and
magnetohydrodynamic\/electrohydrodynamic (MHD\/EHD) concepts.  This
solicitation is offered in this spirit of innovation based on
experimental or computational observations guided by a basic, though not
 necessarily complete, physical understanding of the turbulent
processes. \n\nIn order to stimulate innovation in the area of turbulent
 viscous drag reduction, proposals are sought subject to the following
guidelines:\n\n\u2022\tProposals shall address passive, active, or
reactive concepts for external, attached, fully developed, turbulent
boundary layer viscous drag reduction in air.\n\u2022\tExperimental,
hardware\u2013based proposals and theoretical\/computational proposals
based on realizable hardware are preferred.\n\u2022\tAll practical
physical concepts are acceptable including but not limited to:

concepts, laser\/microwave energy deposition, MHD\/EHD devices, surface
microstructure\/geometry, embedded mechanical devices (VG\u2019s,

curvature effects and pressure gradient (vehicle shaping).

and technologies are acceptable.\n\u2022\tFirst order assessment or
technically plausible discussion of any net system energy saving claims
shall be provided.  \n\u2022\tProof-of-concept experimental
demonstrations are encouraged for Phase I where applicable but are not
required. \n\u2022\tTarget conditions are flight-relevant Reynolds

DFRC\n\nPropulsion controls and dynamics research is being done under
various projects in the Fundamental Aeronautics Program (FAP). For
turbine engines, work on Distributed Engine Control (DEC) and
Model-Based Engine Control (MBEC)is currently being done under the
Subsonic Fixed Wing (SFW) project, and Active Combustion Control
research is currently being done under the Supersonics (SUP) project.
These 3 efforts are expected to transition to the new Aeronautics
Sciences (AS) project in FY13. Aero-Propulso-Servo-Elasticity (APSE)
research will continue under the SUP project. Research activity on
Controls\/Dynamics for electric propulsion systems is expected to be
initiated in FY13 under the reformulated Fixed Wing (FW) project.
Propulsion control and dynamics technologies that help achieve the goals
 of FAP, in terms of: reducing emissions; increasing fuel efficiency;
tool and technology development and validation to address challenges in
High Speed flight; and enabling fast, efficient design and analysis of
advanced aviation systems, are of interest. Proposed activities that are
 compatible with current propulsion controls and dynamics activities
supported by the FAP will be given preference. Following technologies
are of specific interest:\n\n\u2022\tHigh Efficiency Robust Engine
Control - Typical current operating engine control logic is designed
using SISO (Single Input Single Output) PI (Proportional+Integral)
control. The control logic is designed to provide minimum guaranteed
performance while maintaining adequate safety margins throughout the
engine operating life. Additionally, the control logic provides control
of variables of interest such as Thrust, Stall Margin etc. indirectly
since these variables cannot be measured or are not measured in flight
because of restrictions on sensor cost\/placement\/reliability etc. All
this results in highly conservative control design with resulting loss
in efficiency. NASA is currently conducting research in Model-Based
Engine Control (MBEC) where-in an on-board real-time engine model, tuned
 to reflect current engine condition, is used to generate estimate of
quantities of interest that are to be regulated or limited and these
estimates are used to provide direct control of Thrust etc. Alternate
methods such as Model Predictive Control, Adaptive Control, direct
non-linear control, etc. which will achieve the same objectives as the
current MBEC approach while providing practical application of the
control logic in terms of operation with sensor noise, operation across
varying atmospheric conditions, operation across varying engine health
condition over the operating life, and real-time operation within engine
 control hardware limits, are of interest. The emphasis is on practical
application of existing control methods rather than theoretical
derivation of totally new concepts. Control design approaches that can
accommodate small to medium engine component faults and can still
provide desired performance with safe operation are of special interest.
 The pre-requisite for proposals for engine control design methods is
that the NASA C-MAPSS40k (Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System
Simulation for 40,000 lb class thrust engine) be used for control design
 and evaluation. This simulation can only be used by U.S. citizens since
 it is subject to export control laws. Methods for real-time engine
parameter identification using flight data are also of interest by
themselves.\n\u2022\tDistributed Engine Control - Current engine control
 architectures impose limitations on the insertion of new control
capabilities primarily due to weight penalties and reliability issues
related to complex wiring harnesses. Obsolescence management is also a
primary concern in these systems because of the unscheduled cost impact
and recertification issues over the engine life cycle. NASA in
collaboration with AFRL (Air Force Research Lab) has been conducting
research in developing technologies to enable Distributed Engine Control
 (DEC) architectures. The current need is to develop a DEC test-bed
which can be used to investigate a wide range of issues such as system
robustness, stability and performance of various DEC architectures, the
development of network communications requirements, network performance
evaluation, robustness of DEC architectures to data transmission faults
and impact on system performance. The tools just described must be
compatible with the NASA C-MAPSS40k simulation software and easily
integrated into the Hardware-in-the-Loop research facility currently
being developed under a separate contract. Restrictions on access to
these technologies require that any proposed effort will be limited to
work being done by U.S. citizens.\n\u2022\tActive Combustion Control -
The overall objective is to develop all aspects of control systems to
enable safe operation of low emissions combustors throughout the engine
operating envelope. Low emission combustors are prone to thermo-acoustic
 instabilities. So far NASA research in this area has focused on
modulating the main or pilot fuel flow to suppress such instability.
Advanced, ultra-low emissions combustors utilize multi-point
(multi-location) injection to achieve a homogeneous, lean fuel\/air
mixture. There is new interest in using precise control of fuel flow in
such a manner as to suppress or avoid thermo-acoustic instabilities.
Miniature fuel metering devices (and possibly also fuel flow measurement
 devices) are needed that can be physically distributed to be close to
the multi-point fuel injector in order to enable the control system to
accurately place a given proportion of the overall fuel flow to each of
the fuel injection locations.\n\u2022\tAero-Propulso-Servo-Elasticity
(APSE) - The objective of NASA research effort in APSE is to develop a
comprehensive dynamic propulsion system model that can be utilized for
thrust dynamics and integrated APSE vehicle controls and performance
studies, like vehicle ride quality and vehicle stability under typical
vehicle maneuvering and atmospheric disturbances, for supersonic
vehicles. Innovative approaches to dynamic modeling of supersonic
external compression inlets; parallel flow path modeling of the
compression and whole propulsion system to accurately model the
distortion effects of flexible modes, maneuvering and atmospheric
disturbances; and integration of dynamic propulsion models with aircraft
 simulations incorporating flexible modes, are of
interest.\n\u2022\tElectric Propulsion Systems -The objective is to
achieve the required increase in the specific power of high efficiency
electric components to make a 10 mega-watt onboard power generation
and\/or utilization feasible for propulsion. Specific areas of interest
are: advanced electric power control systems for energy management of
battery and fuel cell systems including potentiostatic sensor array to
determine battery state-of-charge (SOC) and battery cycle affected state
 lifetimes; advanced phase angle control systems for electric motors;
and advanced power control systems for effective management of large
multi-motor arrays designated for use in newer turbo-electric aircraft
and embedded boundary layer electric propulsion systems.\n",

        "description": "Lead Center: GRC\nParticipating Center(s):
LaRC\n\nConceptual design and analysis of unconventional vehicle
concepts and technologies is needed for technology portfolio investment
planning, development of advanced concepts to provide technology pull
and independent technical assessment of new concepts. The aerospace
flight vehicle conceptual design phase is the most important step in the
 product development sequence, because of its predefining function.
However, the conceptual design phase is the least well understood part
of the entire flight vehicle design process, owing to its high level of
abstraction and associated risk, its multidisciplinary design
complexity, its permanent shortage of available design information and
its chronic time pressure to find solutions. Often, the important
primary aerospace vehicle design decisions at the conceptual design
level (e.g., overall configuration selection) are still made using
simple analyses and heuristics. Progress has been made recently in
incorporating more physic-based analysis tools in the conceptual design
process, especially in the aerodynamics area, and NASA has developed a
capability that integrates several analysis tools and models in
engineering architectures, such as ModelCenter and OpenMDAO. However,
gaps still remain in many disciplines.\n\nDeveloping higher order, high
fidelity tools suitable for conceptual design is a difficult challenge.
The first issue is analysis turnaround time. To perform the
configuration trades and optimization typical of conceptual design,
runtimes measured in seconds or minutes, instead of hours or days, are
required. However, rapid analysis turn around time alone is
insufficient. To be suitable for conceptual design, tools and methods
are needed which accurately predict the \u201cas-built\u201d
characteristics. Because it is not possible to model every detail of the
 design and account for all the underlying physics in the problem
formulation, it is difficult to predict the \u201cas-built\u201d
characteristics with physics-based methods alone. What is usually
required is a combination of these methods with some semi-empirical
corrections. Ignoring this aspect can lead to higher order tools which
are lower fidelity (less accurate) than the lower order tools they are
intended to replace. Another challenge in conceptual design is a lack of
 detailed design information. Lower order, empirical-based methods
typically used in the past for conceptual design often require only
gross design parameters as inputs. It is, therefore, not necessary to
know design details to obtain a reasonable estimate of the design\u2019s
 performance. High-order, physics-based methods currently require
detailed design knowledge to be useful. For example, whereas
semi-empirical drag prediction tools provide estimates for wing drag
without needing full 3-D geometry including an airfoil design, such
detail is necessary to successfully utilize CFD tools. This gap in the
analysis capability and the maturity of the design being analyzed limits
 the usefulness of the high order analysis in conceptual design.
Physics-based tools for conceptual design must be developed which are
consistent with the amount of design knowledge that is available at the
conceptual design stage.\n\nNASA continues to investigate the potential
of advanced, innovative propulsion and aircraft to improve fuel
efficiency (i.e, reduce CO2 emissions) and to reduce the environmental
footprint (noise and NOx) of future generations of commercial transports
 across the flight speed regime. As such, the agency\u2019s systems
analysts need to have the best design\/analysis tools possible. The
intention of this sub-topic is to solicit proposals for robust,
physics-based tools enabling unconventional configurations to be
addressed in the conceptual design process. Specifically for 2012, the
solicitation will center on new tools and methods that pertain to the
propulsion system. Modeling areas where enhanced capabilities are
desired include the following:\n\n\u2022\tElectric\/Turbo-electric
performance &amp; weight estimation methodologies. Some examples:
\no\tElectric component performance\/weight estimation.\no\tElectric
grid performance and analysis.\no\tThermal management
analysis.\n\u2022\tEnhanced propulsion system performance &amp; weight

incidence-angle swings associated with 50% speed change, and operation
at low unit Reynolds numbers at cruise. VSPT mechanical challenges are
associated with potential response of shaft and blade modes to critical

 advanced turbomachinery and heat transfer concepts, methods and tools
to enable NASA to reach its goals under the Fundamental Aeronautics
Program. These goals include dramatic reductions in aircraft fuel burn,
noise, and emissions, as well as an ability to achieve mission
requirements for, Subsonic, Rotary Wing, and High Speed Project flight
regimes and fundamental research under the Aeronautical Sciences
Project. Turbomachinery includes rotating machinery in the high and low
pressure spools, transition ducts, purge and bleed flows, casing and
hub. In the compression system, advanced concepts and technologies are
required to enable higher overall pressure ratio, high stage loading and
 wider operating range while maintaining or improving aerodynamic
efficiency. Such improvements will enable reduced weight and part count,
 and will enable advanced variable cycle engines for various missions.
In the turbine, the very high cycle temperatures demanded by advanced
engine cycles place a premium on the cooling technologies required to
ensure adequate life of the turbine component. Reduced cooling flow
rates and\/or increased cycle temperatures enabled by these technologies
 have a dramatic impact on the engine performance.\n\nProposals are
sought in the turbomachinery and heat transfer area to provide the
following specific items:\n\n\u2022\tAdvanced instrumentation to enable
time-accurate, detailed measurement of unsteady velocities, pressures
and temperatures in three-dimensional flowfields such as found in
turbomachinery components and transition ducts. This may include
instrumentation and measurement systems capable of operating in

 clearance to chord ratios may be on the order of 5% or above.
Technologies are sought to eliminate flow separation in low pressure

sought to enable very high turbine cooling effectiveness especially
considering the manufacturability of such concepts. These concepts may
include film cooling concepts, internal cooling concepts, and innovative
 methods to couple the film and internal cooling designs. Concepts
proposed should have the potential to be produced with current or
forthcoming manufacturing techniques. The availability of advanced

examine a range of key technology options associated with cryogenic,
non-toxic storable, and solid core nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP)
systems for use in future exploration missions.\n\nNon-toxic engine
technology, including new mono and bipropellants, is desired for use in
lieu of the currently operational NTO\/MMH engine technology. Handling
and safety concerns with toxic chemical propellants can lead to more
costly propulsion systems. NTP systems using nuclear fission reactors
may enable future short round trip missions to Mars, by helping to
reduce launch mass to reasonable values and thereby increasing the
payload delivered for Mars exploration missions.\n\nNon-toxic and
cryogenic engine technologies could range from pump fed or pressure fed
reaction control engines of 25-1000 lbf up to 60,000 lbf primary
propulsion engines. Pump fed NTP engines in the 15,000-25,000 lbf class,
 used individually or in clusters, would be used for primary
propulsion.\n\nSpecific technologies of interest to meet proposed engine
 requirements include:\n\n\u2022\tNon-toxic bipropellant or
monopropellants that meet performance targets (as indicated by high
specific impulse and high specific impulse density) while improving
safety and reducing handling operations as compared to current
state-of-the-art storable propellants.\n\u2022\tManufacturing techniques
 that lower the cost of manufacturing complex components such as
injectors and coolant channels. Examples include, but are not limited
to, development and demonstration of rapid prototype techniques for
metallic parts, powder metallurgy techniques, and application of
nano-technology for near net shape manufacturing.\n\u2022\tHigh
temperature materials, coatings and\/or ablatives or injectors,
combustion chambers, nozzles, and nozzle extensions.\n\u2022\tLong life,
 lightweight, reliable turbo-pump designs and technologies include
seals, bearing and fluid system components. Hydrogen technologies are of
 particular interest.\n\u2022\tHighly-reliable, long-life, fast-acting
propellant valves that tolerate long duration space mission environments
 with reduced volume, mass, and power requirements is also
desirable.\n\u2022\tHigh temperature, low burn-up carbide- and
ceramic-metallic (cermet) based nuclear fuels with improved coatings
and\/or claddings to maximize hydrogen propellant heating and to reduce
fission product gas release into the engine\u2019s hydrogen exhaust
stream.\n\u2022\tHigh temperature and cryogenic radiation tolerant
instrumentation and avionics for engine health monitoring. Non-invasive
designs for measuring neutron flux (outside of reactor), chamber
temperature, operating pressure, and liquid hydrogen propellant flow
rates over wide range of temperatures are desired. Sensors need to
operate for months\/years instead of hours.\n\nNote to Proposer:
Subtopic S3.03 under the Science Mission Directorate also addresses
in-space propulsion. Proposals more aligned with science mission
requirements should be proposed in S3.03.\n\nFor all above technologies,
 research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility
during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II demonstration, and
delivering a demonstration package for NASA testing at the completion of
 the Phase II contract. \nPhase I Deliverables - Research to identify
and evaluate candidate technology applications to demonstrate the
technical feasibility and show a path towards a demonstration. Bench or
lab-level demonstrations are desirable. The technology concept at the
end of Phase I should be at a TRL range of 3-4.\n\nPhase II Deliverables

 The space suit pressure garment requires innovative technologies
focused on performance, environmental protection, and mass reduction.
Two of the critical performance characteristics of a suit are mobility

areas. Other key suit performance enhancements include materials that
enable improved fit and sizing, such as shape change materials that

specific functional tasks. Space suit environmental protection includes
protection from thermal extremes, vacuum, cuts, abrasion and
micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD). Additional environmental
protection is desired for plasma, radiation, electrical shock,
antimicrobials and dust. It is desirable to provide protection in as few
 material layers as possible; therefore, multi-functional materials are

robust, lightweight, and maintainable Primary Life Support System
(PLSS). The PLSS attaches to the space suit pressure garment and
provides approximately an 8 hour supply of oxygen for breathing, suit
pressurization, ventilation and CO2 removal, and a thermal control
system for crew member metabolic heat rejection. Innovative technologies
 are needed for high-pressure O2 delivery, crewmember cooling, heat
rejection, and removal of expired CO2 and water vapor.\n\nSpace Suit
Avionics Systems\n\nFuture generations of advanced space suit avionics
will be far superior to those on the current generation of space suits.
They will be more capable, configurable, lightweight, and low power with
 a footprint that will rival current consumer electronic devices, but
survive the harsh space environment. They must be self-contained, so
that maintenance on the devices can be performed on-orbit or they can be
 easily swapped for functioning or upgraded devices. Those considered
will be radio, displays, and cameras.\n\nFuture advanced radios will be
configurable and, potentially, software-defined and\/or re-configurable
to support future communications network-based architectures in addition
 to the point-to-point communications links that are prevalent today.
The next-generation EVA radios will need to support voice, telemetry,
and standard\/high definition video data flows (up to 20 Mbps) and the
radio architecture will need to be lightweight and power efficient while
 managing data in a seamless and lossless manner between multiple
interfaces. Radios should support space-based or terrestrial-based
protocols to enable communications between multiple entities across a
communications link and have an open and modular architecture.\n\nThe
current generation of Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) and Near-to-Eye (NTE)
 Displays are not viable, since it is desirable for the display to be
decoupled from the user's head for improved safety, comfort, and
alignment. The decoupling makes the specifications for the eyebox
(tolerance to misalignment before image goes out of focus), field of
view (angle of the image created by the optics), and eye relief (working
 distance from the eye to the last optical element) difficult. Key
performance targets include:\n\n\u2022\tGraphical Data Presentation:
SXGA @ 40 \u00b0FOV (possibly biocular).\n\u2022\tDecoupled from User's
Head - Large Eyebox: 100 mm x 100mm x 50mm (D).\n\u2022\tSunlight
Readability: 500 fL inside visor, 1800 fL outside visor (&gt;10 to 1
contrast).\n\nDisplay technologies must ensure that suit displays can
operate outside the suit environment in thermal, radiation, and vacuum
as well as internally without imposing ignition hazards due to 100%
oxygen environment.\n\nCameras will not only provide the crewmember the
ability for still and motion image, but also situational awareness,
which enhances safety for the crewmember. The cameras should be capable
of recording high definition motion and high-resolution imagery with the
 ability to compress the data for transmission over a variety of RF
transmissions and\/or IP networks with varying bandwidths. Hemispherical
 and dynamic cameras are desired. Dynamic cameras can take still images
and motion video in variable bandwidths, capture images based on link
quality, and change frame rates. Hemispherical cameras record 360 \u00b0
 video views of a crewmember, distort views through optics and then
undistort the views via software on the ground to pan\/zoom for total
situational awareness. Cameras should be low-power and lightweight with a
 number of mounting options for optimal placement on the
suit.\n\nTechnology Readiness Levels (TRL) of 4 to 6 or higher are
sought.\n\nPotential NASA Customers include:\n\n\u2022\tEVA Project

 objective of SMD instrument development programs is to implement
science measurement capabilities with smaller or more affordable
spacecraft so development programs can meet multiple mission needs and
therefore make the best use of limited resources. The rapid development
of small, low-cost remote sensing and in situ instruments is essential
to achieving this objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the
 subtopics reflect a focus on instrument development for airborne and
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms. Astrophysics has a critical
need for sensitive detector arrays with imaging, spectroscopy, and
polarimetric capabilities, which can be demonstrated on ground,
airborne, balloon, or suborbital rocket instruments. Heliophysics, which
 focuses on measurements of the sun and its interaction with the Earth
and the other planets in the solar system, needs a significant reduction
 in the size, mass, power, and cost for instruments to fly on smaller
spacecraft. Planetary Science has a critical need for miniaturized
instruments with in situ sensors that can be deployed on surface
landers, rovers, and airborne platforms. For the 2012 program year, we
are restructuring the Sensors, Detectors and Instruments Topic, rotating
 out, combining and retiring some of the subtopics. Please read each
subtopic of interest carefully. One new subtopic, S1.09 Surface and
Sub-surface Measurement Systems was added this year. This new subtopic
solicits proposals that are for ground-based surface vehicles, and
submerged systems. Systems that will provide near-term benefit in a
ground-based application but that are ultimately intended for flight or
mobile platforms are in scope. A key objective of this SBIR topic is to
develop and demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies
that reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of SMD observing
instruments and to enable new measurements. Proposals are sought for
development of components, subsystems and systems that can be used in
planned missions or a current technology program. Research should be
conducted to demonstrate feasibility during Phase I and show a path
towards a Phase II prototype demonstration. The following subtopics are
concomitant with these objectives and are organized by technology.\n",

communications. If crews in the spacecraft must manage, plan and operate
 much of the mission themselves, NASA must migrate operations
functionality from the flight control room to the vehicle for use by the
 crew. Migrating flight controller tools and procedures to the crew
on-board the spacecraft would, even if technically possible, overburden
the crew. Enabling these same monitoring, tracking, and management
capabilities on-board the spacecraft for a small crew to use will
require significant automation and decision support software. Required
capabilities to enable future human spaceflight to distant destinations
include:\n\n\u2022\tEnable on-board crew management of vehicle
consumables that are currently flight controller
responsibilities.\n\u2022\tIncrease the onboard capability to detect and
 respond to unexpected consumables-management related events and faults
without dependence on ground.\n\u2022\tReduce up-front and recurring
software costs to produce flight-critical software.\n\u2022\tProvide
more efficient and cost effective ground based operations through
automation of consumables management processes, and up-front and
recurring mission operations software costs.\n\nThe same capabilities

GSFC, JPL\nOCT Technology Area: TA08\n\nNASA recognizes the potential of
 lidar technology in meeting many of its science objectives by providing
 new capabilities or offering enhancements over current measurements of
atmospheric and topographic parameters from ground, airborne, and
space-based platforms.  To meet NASA's requirements, advances are needed
 in state-of-the-art lidar technology with emphasis on compactness,
efficiency, reliability, lifetime, and high performance. Innovative
lidar subsystem and component technologies systems that directly address
 the measurements of the atmosphere and surface topography of the Earth,
 Mars, the Moon, and other planetary bodies will be considered under
this subtopic. \n\nProposals relevant to the development of lidar
instruments that can be used in planned missions or current technology
programs are highly encouraged.  Examples of planned missions and
technology programs are: Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA),
Doppler Wind Lidar (3D-WINDS), Ozone Lidar, Lidar for Surface Topography
 (LIST), Mars atmospheric sensing, Mars and earth re-entry atmospheric
entry and descent, Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days,
and Seasons (ASCENDS), and Aerosols-Clouds-Ecosystems (ACE).  In
addition, innovative technologies relevant to the NASA sub-orbital
programs, such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Venture-class
focusing on the studies of the Earth climate, carbon cycle, weather, and
 atmospheric composition, are being sought.  \n\nThe proposals should
target components and subsystems development for eventual space
utilization.  Phase I research should demonstrate the technical
feasibility and show a path toward a Phase II prototype unit. Phase II
prototypes should be capable of laboratory demonstration and preferably
suitable for operation in the field from a ground-based station or an
aircraft platform. For the PY12 SBIR Program, we are soliciting the
component and subsystem technologies described below.\n\nSolid state,
single frequency, pulsed, laser transmitter operating in the 1.0 \u00b5m
 - 1.7 \u00b5m range with wall-plug efficiency of greater than 25%
suitable for CO2 measurement, interferometry, and free-space laser
communication applications. The laser transmitter must be capable of
generating frequency transform-limited pulses with a quality beam M2 of
less than 1.5.  We are interested in two different regimes of repetition
 rate and output energy:  in one case, repetition rate from 5 KHz to 20
kHz with pulse energy from 1 - 4 mJ, and in the second case, repetition
rate 20 Hz to 2 kHz with pulse energy from 30 - 300 mJ. In addition,
development of non-traditional optical amplifier architectures that
yield optical efficiency of &gt;70% are of interest.  Attention to the
compact and rugged designs for possible aircraft flight tests is highly
desirable.\n\nSingle-frequency solid-state crystal, planar waveguide or
fiber amplifiers\/lasers operating at 1.5 and 2.0 micron wavelength
regimes suitable for direct detection differential absorption lidar
(DIAL) and coherent lidar applications. These lasers must meet one of
the two general requirements: \n\n\u2022\tPulse energy 0.5 mJ to 2 mJ,
repetition rate 2 kHz to 10 kHz, and pulse duration of 10 nsec for
direct detection lidars. \n\u2022\t5 mJ to 50 mJ, 20 Hz to 2 kHz, 200
nsec for coherent detection lidars. \n\n2-micron single frequency laser
system generating at least 30 mW of power with a precision frequency
locking mechanism suitable for measurements of atmospheric CO2.  The
laser must be locked to a CO2 absorption line peak via a fiber gas cell
with accuracy better than 200 kHz. The frequency locked laser shall be
modulated to generate two preset offset frequencies from the center
frequency alternatively, one at 3-4 GHz, and the other at 15-20GHz
range.  The frequency stability at these off-center frequencies shall be
 better than 500 KHz.\n  \nPulsed, single frequency, solid state laser
operating in the 450-500 nm range serving as a transmitter for an
oceanography lidar.  The laser must be able to produce bandwidth-limited
 pulses with 10 nsec or shorter duration.  The proposed design must be
scalable to at least 10 W of average power, preferably generating100 mJ
at 100-200 Hz, but will consider lower pulse energies with higher
repletion rates. Pulse energies can be less than the above stated goals
by a factor of 10 for the Phase II delivered unit.\n",

        "topic_name": "Entry, Descent and Landing Technology",
        "description": "The Thermal Protection System (TPS) protects a
spacecraft from the severe heating encountered during hypersonic flight
through a planetary atmosphere. In general, there are two classes of TPS
 - reusable and ablative. Typically, reusable TPS applications are
limited to relatively mild entry environments like that of Space
Shuttle. No change in the mass or properties of the TPS material results
 from entry with a significant amount of energy being re-radiated from
the heated surface and the remainder conducted into the TPS material.
Typically, a surface coating with high emissivity (to maximize the
amount of energy re-radiated) and with low surface catalycity (to
minimize convective heating by suppressing surface recombination of
dissociated boundary layer species) is employed. The primary insulation
has low thermal conductivity to minimize the mass of material required
to insulate the primary structure. Ablative TPS materials, in contrast,
accommodate high heating rates and heat loads through phase change and
mass loss. All NASA planetary entry probes to date have used ablative
TPS. Most ablative TPS materials are reinforced composites employing
organic resins as binders. When heated, the resin pyrolyzes producing
gaseous products that are heated as they percolate toward the surface
thus transferring some energy from the solid to the gas. Additionally,
the injection of the pyrolysis gases into the boundary layer alters the
boundary layer properties resulting in reduced convective heating.
However, the gases may undergo chemical reactions with the boundary
layer gases that could return heat to the surface. Furthermore, chemical
 reactions between the surface material and boundary layer species can
result in consumption of the surface material leading to surface
recession. Those reactions can be endothermic (vaporization,
sublimation) or exothermic (oxidation) and will have an important impact
 on net energy to the surface. Clearly, in comparison to reusable TPS
materials, the interaction of ablative TPS materials with the
surrounding gas environment is much more complex as there are many more
mechanisms to accommodate the entry heating. NASA has successfully
tackled the complexity of thermal protection systems for numerous
missions to inner and outer planets in our solar system in the past; the
 knowledge gained has been invaluable but incomplete. Future missions
will be more demanding. Better performing ablative TPS than currently
available is needed to satisfy requirements of the most severe missions,
 e.g., Near Earth Object Earth Return with velocities exceeding 11.5
km\/s and Heavy Mass Mars Landing with 8 km\/s entry. In addition, new
low ballistic coefficient deployable systems may require flexible
ablative TPS materials that can protect systems experiencing heat fluxes
 ranging from 30 W\/cm2 to 300 W\/cm2, depending on their missions.
Beyond the improvement needed in ablative TPS materials, more demanding
future missions such as large payload missions to Mars will require
novel entry system designs that consider different vehicle shapes,
deployable or inflatable configurations and integrated approaches of TPS
 materials with the entry system sub-structure.",

systems that exhibit maximum robustness, reliability and survivability
while maintaining minimum mass requirements, and capable of enduring
severe combined convective and radiative heating. In addition, in order

anisotropic materials have been installed in their proper orientation,
that the bondline as well as the TPS materials have the proper integrity

 JPL, KSC, MSFC\nOCT Technology Area: TA08\n\nCryogenic cooling systems
often serve as enabling technologies for detectors and sensors flown on
scientific instruments as well as advanced telescopes and observatories.
 As such, technological improvements to cryogenic systems (as well as
components) further advance the mission goals of NASA through enabling
performance (and ultimately science gathering) capabilities of flight
detectors and sensors. Presently, there are six potential investment
areas that NASA is seeking to expand state of the art capabilities in
for possible use on future programs such as GEOID, SPICA, WFirst
(http:\/\/wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov\/), Spirit, Specs
(http:\/\/nmdb.gsfc.nasa.gov\/geons) and the Europa Science missions
(http:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/multimedia\/podcasting\/jpl-europa20090218.html).
 The topic areas are as follows: \n\n\u2022\tExtremely Low Vibration
Cooling Systems - Examples of such systems include pulse tube coolers
and turbo brayton cycles. Desired cooling capabilities sought are on the
 order of 20 mW at 4K or 1W at 50K. Present state of the art
capabilities display &lt; 100 mN vibration at operational frequencies of
 30-70 Hz. Proposed systems should either satisfy or improve upon this
benchmark. \n\u2022\tAdvanced Magnetic Cooler Components - An example of
 an advanced magnetic cooler might be Adiabatic Demagnetization
Refrigeration systems. Specific components sought include: \no\tLow
current superconducting magnets.\no\tActive\/Passive magnetic shielding
(3-4 Tesla magnets).\no\tSuperconducting leads (10K - 90K) capable of 10
 amp operation with 1 mW conduction.\no\t10 mK scale thermometry.
\n\u2022\tContinuous Flow Distributed Cooling Systems - Distributed
cooling provides increased lifetime of cryogen fluids for applications
on both the ground and spaceborne platforms. This has impacts on payload
 mass and volume for flight systems which translate into costs (either
on the ground, during launch or in flight). Cooling systems that provide
 continuous distributed flow are a cost effective alternative to present
 techniques\/methodologies. Cooling systems that can be used with large
loads and\/or deployable structures are presently being sought after.
\n\u2022\tHeat Switches - Current heat switches require detailed
procedures for operational repeatability. More robust (performance wise)
 heat switches are currently needed for ease of operation when used with
 space flight applications. \n\u2022\tHighly Efficient Magnetic and
Dilution Cooling Technologies - The desired temperature range for
proposed systems is &lt; 1K. Presently, systems with performance
capabilities on this scale are limited to continuous ADRs. Alternative
systems and\/or technologies are desired. \n\u2022\tLow
Temperature\/Input Power Cooling Systems - Cooling systems providing
cooling capacities approximately 0.3W at 35K with heat rejection
capability to temperature sinks upwards of 150K are of interest.
Presently there are no cooling systems operating at this heat rejection
temperature. Input powers should be limited to no greater than 20W.
Study of passive cooler in tandem with low power, low mass cryocooler

allow future missions to implement new and more capable science
instruments, greatly enhance human missions beyond Earth orbit, and

antenna technology, transmit array concepts, and communications in
support of launch services are very important to the future of
exploration and science activities of the Agency. Additionally,

that can be used to fabricate 16 m class or greater, lightweight,

GRC, GSFC\nOCT Technology Area: TA05\n\nThis subtopic seeks to develop
innovative long-range RF telecommunications technologies supporting the
needs of space missions.\n\nIn the future, spacecraft with increasingly
capable instruments producing large quantities of data will be visiting
the Moon and the planets. These spacecraft will also support long term
missions, such as to the outer planets, or extended missions with new
objectives. They will possess reconfigurable avionics and communication
subsystems and will be designed to require less intervention from earth
during periods of low activity. The communication needs of these
missions motivate higher data rate capabilities on the uplink and
downlink as well as more reliable RF and timing subsystems. Innovative
long-range telecommunications technologies that maximize power
efficiency, reliability, receiver capability, transmitted power and data
 rate, while minimizing size, mass and DC power consumption are
required. The current state-of-the-art in long-range RF space
telecommunications is 6 Mbps from Mars using microwave communications
systems (X-Band and Ka-Band) with output power levels in the low tens of
 Watts and DC-to-RF efficiencies in the range of 10-25%.\n\nTechnologies

GSFC, JPL\nOCT Technology Area: TA08\n\nThis subtopic solicits solutions
 in the following areas:\n\n\u2022\tOptical Components, Coatings and

Coatings and Systems for potential UV\/Optical missions. \n\u2022\tLarge
 aperture diffusers (up to 1 meter) to calibrate GeoStationary Earth

specifically identifies optical components and coatings as key
technologies needed to enable several different future missions,
including:\n\n\u2022\tLight-weight X-ray imaging mirrors for future
large advanced X-ray observatories.\n\u2022\tLarge aperture,
light-weight mirrors for future UV\/Optical
telescopes.\n\u2022\tBroadband high reflectance coatings for future
UV\/Optical telescopes.\n\nThe 2012 National Academy report \u201cNASA
Space Technology Roadmaps and Priorities\u201d states that one of the
top technical challenges in which NASA should invest over the next five
years is developing a new generation of larger effective aperture,
lower-cost astronomical telescopes that enable discovery of habitable
planets, facilitate advances in solar physics, and enable the study of
faint structures around bright objects.  To enable this capability
requires low-cost, ultra-stable, large-aperture, normal and grazing
incidence mirrors with low mass-to-collecting area ratios.  To enable
these new astronomical telescopes, the report identifies three specific
optical systems technologies:\n\n\u2022\tActive align\/control of
grazing-incidence imaging systems to achieve &lt; 1 arc-second angular
resolution.\n\u2022\tActive align\/control of normal-incidence imaging
systems to achieve 500 nm diffraction limit (40 nm rms wavefront error,
WFE) performance.\n\u2022\tNormal incidence 4-meter (or larger) diameter
 5 nm rms WFE (300 nm system diffraction limit) mirrors.\n\nFinally,
effecting potential space telescopes, NASA is developing a heavy lift
space launch system (SLS).  An SLS with an 8 to 10 meter fairing and 80
to 100 mt capacity to LEO would enable extremely large space telescopes.
  Potential systems include 12 to 30 meter class segmented primary
mirrors for UV\/optical or infrared wavelengths and 8 to 16 meter class
segmented X-ray telescope mirrors.  These potential future space
telescopes have very specific mirror technology needs. UV\/optical
telescopes (such as ATLAST-9 or ATLAST-16) require 1 to 3 meter class
mirrors with &lt; 5 nm rms surface figures.  IR telescopes (such as
SAFIR\/CALISTO) require 2 to 3 to 8 meter class mirrors with
cryo-deformations &lt; 100 nm rms.  X-ray telescopes (such as GenX)
require 1 to 2 meter long grazing incidence segments with angular
resolution &lt; 0.5 arc-sec and surface micro-roughness &lt; 0.5-nm rms.
  \n\nProposals should show an understanding of one or more relevant
science needs, and present a feasible plan to fully develop a technology
 and infuse it into a NASA program.\n\nTechnical Challenges \n\nIn all
cases, the most important metric for an advanced optical system is
affordability or areal cost (cost per square meter of collecting
aperture).  Currently both X-ray and normal incidence space mirrors cost
 $4 million to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area.
This research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical
components by 5 to 50 times, to less than $1M to $100K\/m2.
\n\nSuccessful proposals shall provide a scale-up roadmap (including
processing and infrastructure issues) for full scale space qualifiable
flight optics systems.  Material behavior, process control, active
and\/or passive optical performance, and mounting\/deploying issues
should be resolved and demonstrated.\n\nOptical Components, Coatings and
 Systems for potential X-ray missions \n\nPotential X-ray missions
require: \n \n\u2022\tX-ray imaging telescopes with  1 to 5 m2
collecting area.\n\u2022\tMultilayer high-reflectance coatings for hard
X-ray mirrors (similar to NuSTAR).\n\u2022\tX-ray transmission and\/or
reflection gratings.\n\nMultiple technologies are needed to enable &lt; 1
 arc-sec X-ray telescopes.  These include, but are not limited to:  new
mirror materials such as silicon carbide, porous silicon, beryllium;
improved techniques to manufacture (such as direct precision machining,
rapid optical fabrication, slumping or replication technologies) 0.3 to 2
 meter mirror shells or segments; improved testing techniques; active
alignment of mirrors in a telescope assembly; and active control of
mirror shape.  \n\nFor example, the Wide-Field X-Ray Telescope (WFXT)
requires a 6 meter focal length X-ray mirror with 1 arc-sec resolution
and 1 m2 of collecting area.  One implementation of this mirror has 71
concentric full shell hyperbola\/parabola pairs whose diameters range
from 0.3 to 1.0 meter and whose length is 150 to 240 mm (this length is
split between the H\/P pair).  Total mass for the integrated mirror
system (shells and structure) is &lt; 1000 kg.  For individual mirror
shells, axial slope errors should be ~ 1 arc-sec rms (~100 nm rms figure
 error for 20 mm spatial frequencies) and surface finish should be &lt;
0.5 nm rms.\n\nSuccessful proposals will demonstrate an ability to
manufacture, test and control a prototype X-ray mirror assembly in the
0.25 to 0.5 meter class; or to coat a 0.25 to 0.5 meter class
representative optical component.  An ideal Phase I deliverable would
deliver a sub-scale component such as a 0.25 meter X-ray precision
mirror.  An ideal Phase II project would further advance the technology
to produce a space-qualifiable 0.5 meter mirror, with a TRL in the 4 to 5
 range.  Both deliverables would be accompanied by all necessary
documentation, including the optical performance assessment and all data
 on processing and properties of its substrate materials.  The Phase II
would also include a mechanical and thermal stability analysis.
\n\nOptical Components, Coatings and Systems for potential UV\/Optical
missions \n\nPotential UV\/Optical missions require: \n\n\u2022\tLarge
aperture, light-weight mirrors. \n\u2022\tBroadband high reflectance
coatings.\n\nFuture UVOIR missions require 4 to 8 or 16 meter monolithic
 or segmented primary mirrors with &lt; 10 nm rms surface figures.
Mirror areal density depends upon available launch vehicle capacities to
 Sun-Earth L2 (i.e., 15 kg\/m2 for a 5 m fairing EELV vs. 60 kg\/m2 for a
 10 m fairing SLS).  Additionally, future UVOIR missions require
high-reflectance mirror coatings with spectral coverage from 100 to 2500
 nm and extremely uniform amplitude and polarization
properties.\n\nSuccessful proposals will demonstrate an ability to
manufacture, test and control ultra-low-cost precision 0.25 to 0.5 meter
 optical systems; or to coat a 0.25 to 0.5 meter representative optical
component.  Potential solutions include, but are not limited to, new
mirror materials such as silicon carbide, nanolaminates or carbon-fiber
reinforced polymer; new fabrication processes such as direct precision
machining, rapid optical fabrication, roller embossing at optical
tolerances, slumping or replication technologies to manufacture 1 to 2
meter (or larger) precision quality mirrors or lens segments.  Solutions
 include reflective, transmissive, diffractive or high order diffractive
 blazed lens optical components for assembly of large (16 to 32 meter)
optical quality primary elements.  \n\nPotential solutions to improve UV
 reflective coatings include, but are not limited to, investigations of
new coating materials with promising UV performance; new deposition
processes; and examination of handling processes, contamination control,
 and safety procedures related to depositing coatings, storing coated
optics, and integrating coated optics into flight hardware.  An ability
to demonstrate optical performance on 2 to 3 meter class optical
surfaces is important.\n\nAn ideal Phase I deliverable would be a
precision mirror of at least 0.25 meters; or a coated mirror of at least
 0.25 meters.  An ideal Phase II project would further advance the
technology to produce a space-qualifiable mirror greater than 0.5
meters, with a TRL in the 4 to 5 range.  Both deliverables would be
accompanied by all necessary documentation, including the optical
performance assessment and all data on processing and properties of its
substrate materials.  The Phase II would also include a mechanical and
thermal stability analysis.  \n\nLarge aperture diffusers (up to 1
meter) to calibrate GeoStationary Earth viewing sensors\n\nThe
geosynchronous orbit for GEO-CAPE coastal ecosystem imager requires
technology for alternative periodic solar calibration strategies
including new materials to reduce weight, and new optical analysis to
reduce the size of calibration systems. GEO-CAPE will need a
light-weight large aperture (greater than 0.5 m) diffuse solar
calibrator, employing multiple diffusers to track on-orbit degradation.
Typical materials of interest are PTFE (such as Spectralon\u00ae surface
 diffuser) or development of new Mie scattering materials for use as
volume diffusers in transmission or reflection.  Material needs to be
stable in BTDF\/BSDF to 2%\/year from 250 to 2500 nm and highly
lambertian (no formal specification for deviation from lambertian).\n",

especially techniques and instrumentation that can perform measurements
while the optic is mounted to the figuring\/polishing machine. Large
lightweight monolithic metallic aspheres manufactured using innovative
mirror substrate materials that can be assembled and welded together

Navigation, and Timing (PNT) state-of-the-art relies on both
ground-based and space-based radiometric tracking, laser ranging, and
optical navigation techniques. Post-processed GPS position determination
 performance accuracy is at the cm-level at Near-Earth distances and at
meter-level at High-Earth Orbit distances; while autonomous real-time
GPS performance, such as provided by GPS-Enhanced Onboard Navigation
System (GEONS) can achieve accuracy performance of 20 meters. For
missions at Mars, Deep Space Network navigation services provide
performance accuracy of 1km, while optical navigation methodologies
obtain performance accuracy of 10s of km at this distance.\n\nFuture
NASA missions will require precision landing, rendezvous, formation
flying, cooperative robotics, proximity operations, and coordinated
platform operations. As such, the need for increased precision in
absolute and relative navigation solutions increases. As operations
occur further from Earth and more complex navigational maneuvers are
performed, it will be necessary to reduce the reliance on Earth-based
systems for real-time decisions. Investments in technologies to
implement autonomous on-board navigation and maneuvering will permit a
reduction in dependence on ground-based tracking, ranging,
trajectory\/orbit\/attitude determination, and maneuver planning and
support functions. Therefore, the early focus for NASA will be to
improve PNT through increasing real-time PNT accuracy and precision, as
well as achieving this performance in autonomously on-board the

 innovative, game changing communications technologies that have the
potential to enable order of magnitude performance improvements for
space operations, exploration systems, and\/or science mission
applications. As NASA moves towards an integrated network architecture,
infusion of critical, enabling technologies will be key to meeting user
needs and offering standardized services. Emphasis for this subtopic is
on the mid - (3-8 yrs.), and far-term (&gt;8 yrs.) with focused research
 in the following areas:\n\nDevelop novel techniques for size, weight,
and power (SWAP) of communications systems by addressing digital
processing and logic implementation tradeoffs, dynamic power management,
 hardware and software partitioning. Address reliability, robustness,
and radiation tolerance for missions beyond low Earth orbit. Investigate
 and demonstrate unique, innovative electronic or optical technologies
to alleviate demanding mission requirements (at least 10X improvement
over state-of-the-art) in areas such as chip speed, compression,
encoding\/decoding, etc. Communication systems optimized for energy
efficiency (information bits per unit energy) will be increasingly
important for low energy communication systems.\n\nSmall spacecraft, due
 to their limited surface area, are typically power constrained,
limiting small spacecraft communications systems to low bandwidth
architectures. Technologies and architectures that can exploit
commercial or other terrestrial communication infrastructures to enable
novel small satellite (e.g., CubeSat) missions are desired. Identify
advanced solutions for higher density integration techniques and
packaging. Address how existing communications architectures can be
adapted and utilized to provide higher bandwidth communications
capabilities with better performance and at lower cost for spacecraft to
 ground, and spacecraft to spacecraft applications.\n\nNovel approaches
to addressing extremely high bandwidth, high data rate signaling using
RF, mm-wave (Ka- to W- band), and\/or optical (1550 nm) links.) Purely
optical links are subject to atmospheric interference (clouds, rain,
snow, fog, etc.) and can restrict operations for Earth-based optical
terminals, so hybrid RF\/optical systems are intriguing. Technologies
that address flexible, scalable digital\/optical core processing
topologies to support both RF and optical communications in a single
dual-feed terminal, such as: programmable modulation\/coding, multi-rate
 clocking and data recovery, system-on-a-chip integration, memory
management, multi-processor architectures, etc. are sought to mitigate
risk of such a system.\n\nFor all above technologies, research should be
 conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a
 path towards Phase II demonstration with delivery of a demonstration
unit or package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II
contract.\n\nOpportunities and plans should also be identified and
summarized for potential commercialization.\n\nPhase I Deliverables -
Phase I deliverables shall include a final report describing design
studies and analyses, system, sensor, or instrumentation concepts,
prospective formulations, testing, etc. Prototype systems, components,
sensors, instruments or materials can be developed in Phase I as well.
The designs or concepts should have commercialization potential. For
Phase II consideration, the final report should include a detailed path
towards Phase II proof-of-concept system or component or testing as
applicable. The technology concept at the end of Phase I should be at a
TRL range of 2-3.\n\nPhase II Deliverables - Phase II deliverables shall
 consist of working proof-of-concept systems, samples, component,
sensor, or instrumentation hardware, etc. which have been successfully
demonstrated in a relevant environment and delivered to NASA for testing
 and verification. The technology at the end of Phase II should be at a

subtopic, proposals are solicited to develop energy storage and power
electronics to enable or enhance the capabilities of future science
missions.  The unique requirements for the power systems for these
missions can vary greatly, with advancements in components needed above
the current State of the Art (SOA) for high energy density, high power
density, long life, high reliability, low mass\/volume, radiation
tolerance, and wide temperature operation.  Other subtopics that could

(http:\/\/nasascience.nasa.gov\/about-us\/science-strategy), and the
2003 SSE Decadal Survey describe the need for lighter weight, lower
power electronics along with radiation hardened, extreme environment
electronics for planetary exploration.  Radioisotope power systems (RPS)
 and Power Processing Units (PPUs) for Electric Propulsion (EP) are two
programs of interest that would directly benefit from advancements in
this technology area.  Advances in electrical power technologies are
required for the electrical components and systems for these future

state-of-the-art.  Of importance are expected improvements in energy
density, speed, efficiency, or wide-temperature operation (-125 \u00b0C
to over 450 \u00b0C) with a number of thermal cycles.  Novel approaches
to minimizing the weight of advanced PPUs are also of interest.
Advancements are sought for power electronic devices, components and
packaging for programs with power ranges of a few watts for minimum
missions to up to 20 kilowatts for large missions.  In addition to
electrical component development, RPS has a need for intelligent,
fault-tolerant Power Management And Distribution (PMAD) technologies to
efficiently manage the system power for these deep space

fault-tolerant electrical components and PMAD systems.\n\u2022\tAdvanced
 electronic packaging for thermal control and electromagnetic

advanced primary and secondary battery systems capable of operating at
temperature extremes from -100 \u00b0C for Titan missions to 400 \u00b0
to 500 \u00b0C for Venus missions, and a span of -230 \u00b0C to +120
\u00b0C for Lunar Quest.  The Outer Planet Assessment Group and the 2011
 PSD Relevant Technologies Document have specifically called out high
energy density storage systems as a need for the Titan\/Enceladus
Flagship and planetary exploration missions.  In addition, high
energy-density rechargeable electrochemical battery systems that offer
greater than 50,000 charge\/discharge cycles (10 year operating life)
for low-earth-orbiting spacecraft, 20 year life for geosynchronous (GEO)
 spacecraft, are desired.  Advancements to battery energy storage
capabilities that address one or more of the above requirements for the
stated missions combined with very high specific energy and energy
density (&gt;200 Wh\/kg for secondary battery systems), along with
radiation tolerance are of interest.  \n\nIn addition to batteries,
other advanced energy storage\/load leveling technologies designed to
the above mission requirements, such as flywheels, supercapacitors or
magnetic energy storage, are of interest.  These technologies have the
potential to minimize the size and mass of future power
systems.\n\nResearch should be conducted to demonstrate technical
feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II, and when
possible, deliver a demonstration unit for NASA testing at the
completion of the Phase II contract.  Phase II emphasis should be placed
 on developing and demonstrating the technology under relevant test
conditions. Additionally, a path should be outlined that shows how the

obtainable step-free area achievable by prior art processes. The
step-free SiC surface is particularly suited for the heteroepitaxial
growth of 3C (cubic) SiC, AlN, and GaN films used for the fabrication of

GSFC, JSC\nOCT Technology Area: TA04\n\nNew technologies for robotic
mobility, manipulation, and sampling are needed to enable access to
sites of interest and acquisition and handling of samples for in-situ
analysis or return to Earth from planetary and solar system small bodies
 including Mars, Venus, comets, asteroids, and planetary moons.
\n\nMobility technologies are needed to enable access to crater walls,
canyons, gullies, sand dunes, and high rock density regions for
planetary bodies where gravity dominates, such as the Moon and Mars.
Trafficability challenges include steep terrain, obstacle size, and low
soil cohesion.  Tethered systems, non-wheeled systems, and marsupial
systems are examples of mobility technologies that are of interest.
Technologies to enable mobility on small bodies in micro-gravity
environments are also of interest.   \nManipulation technologies are
needed to enable deployment of sampling tools and handling of samples.
Mars mission sample-handling technologies are needed to enable transfer
and storage of a range of rock and regolith cores approximately 1cm long
 and up to about 10cm long.   Small-body mission manipulation
technologies are needed to deploy sampling tools to the surface and
transfer samples to in-situ instruments and sample storage
containers.\n\nSample acquisition tools are needed to acquire samples on
 planetary and small bodies.  For Mars, a coring tool is needed to
acquire rock and regolith cores approximately 1cm diameter and up to
10cm long which also supports transfer of the samples to a sample
handling system.  Abrading bits for the tool are needed to provide
rock-surface abrasion capability to better than 0.2mm scale roughness.  A
 deep drill is needed to enable sample acquisition from the subsurface
including rock cores to 3m depth and icy samples from deeper locations.
 Tools for sampling from asteroids and comets are needed which support
transfer of the sample for in-situ analysis or sample return.  Tools for
 acquisition and transfer of icy samples on Europa are also of interest.
   Minimization of mass and ability to work reliably in the harsh
mission environment are important characteristics for the tools.
Example environmental conditions include microgravity for small-body
missions, high pressure and temperature (460 \u00b0C, 93bar) on Venus,
and at Europa the radiation environment is estimated at 2.9 Mrad total
ionizing dose (TID) behind 100 mil thick aluminum.\n\nContamination
control and planetary protection are important considerations for sample
 acquisition and handling technologies.  Contamination may include
Earth-source contaminants produced by the sampling tool, handling
system, or deposited on the sampling location from another source on the
 rover.  Consideration should be given to:\n\n\u2022\tInnovative
\u201ccleaning to sterility\u201d technologies that will be compatible
with spacecraft materials and processes. \n\u2022\tSurface cleaning
validation methods that can be used routinely to quantify trace amount
(~ng\/cm2) of organic contamination and submicron particle (~100nm size)
 contamination. \n\nPriority will be given to the cleaning and
sterilization methods that have potential for in-situ applications.
Avoiding cross contamination between samples is also a priority.
Innovative mechanical or system solutions\u2014e.g., single-use sample
"sleeves" or fully integrated sample acquisition and encapsulation
systems are also needed to ensure sample integrity.\n\nInnovative
component technologies for low-mass, low-power, and modular systems
tolerant to the in situ environment are of particular interest.
Technical feasibility should be demonstrated during Phase I and a full
capability unit of at least TRL 4 should be delivered in Phase II.
Proposals should show an understanding of relevant science needs and
engineering constraints and present a feasible plan to fully develop a
technology and infuse it into a NASA program.  Specific areas of
interest include the following: \n\n\u2022\tSteep terrain adherence for
vertical and horizontal mobility. \n\u2022\tTether play-out and
retrieval systems including tension and length sensing.
\n\u2022\tLow-mass tether cables with power and communication.
\n\u2022\tSampling system deployment mechanisms. \n\u2022\tLow

separated from their significant others and will no longer have access
to social support currently provided to the ISS crews. They are living
in a confined and isolated environment devoid of normal Earth settings
as they venture to distant destinations. Long communication delays

TA06\n\nThe purpose of the NASA Advanced Food Technology Project is to
develop, evaluate and deliver food technologies for human centered
spacecraft that will support crews on long duration missions beyond
low-Earth orbit. Safe, nutritious, acceptable, and varied shelf-stable
foods with a shelf life of 5 years will be required to support the crew
during these exploration missions. Concurrently, the food system must
efficiently balance appropriate vehicle resources such as mass, volume,
water, air, waste, power, and crew time.\n\nRefrigeration and freezing
require significant vehicle resource utilization, so NASA provisions
consist solely of shelf stable foods. Stability is achieved by thermal
or irradiative processing to kill the microorganisms in the food, or
drying to prevent viability of the microorganisms. These methods do
impact the micronutrients within the food substrate. Environmental
factors (such as moisture ingress and oxidation) are also capable of
compromising the nutrient content over the shelf life of the food. Since
 the food system is the sole source of nutrition to the crew, a
significant loss in nutrient availability could significantly jeopardize
 the health and performance of the crew. Optimal nutritional content of
the food for five years will ensure that the food can support crew
performance and help protect their bodies from deficiencies that cause
disease.\n\nVitamin content in NASA foods, such as vitamin C, vitamin A,
 thiamin, and folic acid, is degraded during processing and as the
product ages in storage.  The goal is to develop a system that either
increases the bioavailability of the nutrients or protects the vitamins
from this biological or chemical degradation at ambient temperatures

increasingly turning to large-scale numerical simulation on
supercomputers to advance understanding of complex Earth and
astrophysical systems, and to conduct high-fidelity aerospace
engineering analyses. The goal of this subtopic is to increase the
mission impact of NASA\u2019s investments in supercomputing systems and
associated operations and services. Specific objectives are
to:\n\n\u2022\tDecrease the barriers to entry for prospective
supercomputing users.\n\u2022\tMinimize the supercomputer user\u2019s
total time-to-solution (e.g., time to discover, understand, predict, or

NASA\u2019s supercomputing users, broaden NASA\u2019s supercomputing
user base, accelerate advancement of NASA science and engineering, and
benefit the supercomputing community through dissemination of
operational best practices.\n\nThe approach of this subtopic is to seek
novel software and hardware technologies that provide notable benefits
to NASA\u2019s supercomputing users and facilities, and to infuse these
technologies into NASA supercomputing operations. Successful technology
development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for
follow-on funding by, and infusion into, NASA\u2019s high-end computing
(HEC) projects: the High End Computing Capability project at Ames and
the Scientific Computing project at Goddard. To assure maximum relevance
 to NASA, funded SBIR contracts under this subtopic should engage in
direct interactions with one or both HEC projects, and with key HEC
users where appropriate. Research should be conducted to demonstrate
technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path
toward a Phase II prototype demonstration.\n\nOfferors should
demonstrate awareness of the state-of-the-art of their proposed
technology, and should leverage existing commercial capabilities and
research efforts where appropriate. Open Source software and open
standards are strongly preferred. Note that the NASA supercomputing
environment is characterized by: HEC systems operating behind a firewall
 to meet strict IT security requirements, communication-intensive
applications, massive computations requiring high concurrency, complex
computational workflows and immense datasets, and the need to support
hundreds of complex application codes \u2013 many of which are
frequently updated by the user\/developer. As a result, solutions that
involve the following must clearly explain how they would work in the
NASA environment: Grid computing, web services, client-server models,
embarrassingly parallel computations, and technologies that require
significant application re-engineering. Projects need not benefit all
NASA HEC users or application codes, but demonstrating applicability to
an important NASA discipline, or even a key NASA application code, could
 provide significant value.\n\nSpecific technology areas of
interest:\n\n\u2022\tEfficient Computing: In spite of the rapidly
increasing capability and efficiency of supercomputers, NASA\u2019s HEC
facilities cannot purchase, power, and cool sufficient HEC resources to
satisfy all user demands. This subtopic element seeks dramatically more
efficient and effective supercomputing approaches in terms of their
ability to supply increased HEC capability or capacity per dollar
and\/or per Watt for real NASA applications. Examples include:\no\tNovel
 computational accelerators and architectures.\no\tCloud supercomputing
with high performance interconnects (e.g., InfiniBand).\no\tEnhanced
visualization technologies.\no\tImproved algorithms for key
codes.\no\tPower-aware \u201cGreen\u201d computing technologies and
techniques.\n\u2022\tApproaches to effectively manage and utilize
many-core processors including algorithmic changes, compiler techniques
and runtime systems.\n\u2022\tUser Productivity Environments: The user
interface to a supercomputer is typically a command line in a text
window. This subtopic element seeks more intuitive, intelligent,
user-customizable, and integrated interfaces to supercomputing
resources, enabling users to more completely leverage the power of HEC
to increase their productivity. Such an interface could enhance many
essential supercomputing tasks: accessing and managing resources,
training, getting services, developing and porting codes (e.g.,
debugging and performance analysis), running computations, managing
files and data, analyzing and visualizing results, transmitting data,
collaborating, etc.\n\u2022\tUltra-Scale Computing: Over the next
decade, the HEC community faces great challenges in enabling its users
to effectively exploit next-generation supercomputers featuring massive
concurrency to the tune of millions of cores. To overcome these
challenges, this subtopic element seeks ultra-scale computing
technologies that enable resiliency\/fault-tolerance in extreme-scale
(unreliable) systems both at job startup and during execution. Also of
interest are system and software co-design methodologies, to achieve
performance and efficiency synergies. Finally, tools are sought that
facilitate verification and validation of ultra-scale applications and
systems.\n",

and unique approaches to solve issues associated around the use of
\u201cBig Data\u201d within NASA. The emphasis of this subtopic is on
tools that leverage existing systems, interfaces, and infrastructure,
where it exists and where appropriate. Reuse of existing NASA assets is
strongly encouraged. \n \nSpecifically, innovations are being sought in
the following areas:\n\n\u2022\tParallel Processing for Data Analytics
\u2013 Open source tools like the Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS)
 have shown promise for use in simple MapReduce operations to analyze
model and observation data. In addition to HDFS, there is a rapid
emergence and adoption of cloud software packages integrated with object
 stores, such as OpenStack and Swift. The goal is to accelerate these
types of open source tools for use with binary structured data from
observations and model output using MapReduce or a similar
paradigm.\n\u2022\tHigh Performance File System Abstractions \u2013 NASA
 scientists currently use a large number of existing applications for
data analysis, such as GrADS, python scripts, and more, that are not
compatible with an object storage environment. If data were stored
within an object storage environment, these applications would not be
able to access the data. Many of these applications would require a
substantial amount of investment to enable them to use object storage
file systems. Therefore, a file system abstraction, such as FUSE (file
system in user space) is needed to facilitate the use of existing data
analysis applications with an object storage environment. The goal is to
 make a FUSE-like file system abstraction robust, reliable, and highly
performing for use with large NASA data sets.\n\u2022\tData Management
of Large-Scale Scientific Repositories \u2013 With increasing size of
scientific repositories comes an increasing demand for using the data in
 ways that may never have been imagined when the repository was
conceived. The goal is to provide capabilities for the flexible
repurposing of scientific data, including large-scale data integration,
aggregation, representation, and distribution to emerging user
communities and applications.\n\u2022\tServer Side Data Processing
\u2013 Large data repositories make it necessary for analytical codes to
 migrate to where the data are stored. Hadoop does that at the level of a
 single HDFS. In a densely networked world of geographically distributed
 repositories, tiered intermediation is needed. The goal is to provide
support for migratable codes and analytical outputs as first class
objects within a provenance-oriented data management
cyberinfrastructure. \n\u2022\tTechniques for Data Analysis and
Visualization \u2013 New methods for data analytics that scale to
extremely large data sets are necessary for data mining, searching,
fusion, subsetting, discovery, visualization, and more. In addition, new
 algorithms and methods are needed to look for unknown correlations
across large, distributed scientific data sets. The goal is to increase
the scientific value of model and observation data by making analysis
easier and higher performing. Among others, some of the topics of
interest are:\no\tTechniques for automated derivation of analysis
products such as machine learning for extraction of features in large
image datasets (e.g., volcanic thermal measurement, plume measurement,
automated flood mapping, disturbance mapping, change detection,
etc.).\no\tWorkflows for automated data processing, interpretation, and
distribution.\n\u2022\tAccelerated Large Scale Data Movement \u2013
There are a multitude of large distributed data stores across NASA that
includes both observation and model data. The movement of data across
the network must be optimized to take full advantage of large-scale data
 analytics, especially when comparing model to observation data. The
goal is to optimize data movement in the following ways:\no\tAccelerate
and make it easier to move data over the wide area to facilitate
large-scale data management and analysis.\no\tOptimize the movement of
data within more local environments, such as the usage of Remote Direct
Memory Access (RDMA) within HDFS.\no\tVirtualization of high-speed
network interfaces for use within cloud environments.\n \nResearch
proposed to this subtopic should demonstrate technical feasibility
during Phase I, and in partnership with scientists, show a path toward a
 Phase II prototype demonstration, with significant communication with
missions and programs to ensure a successful Phase III infusion. It is
highly desirable that the proposed projects lead to software that is
infused into NASA programs and projects. \n\nTools and products
developed under this subtopic may be used for broad public dissemination
 or within a narrow scientific community. These tools can be plug-ins or
 enhancements to existing software, on-line data\/computing services, or
 new stand-alone applications or web services, provided that they
promote interoperability and use standard protocols, file formats and
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or prevalent applications.\n",

 JPL\nOCT Technology Area: TA11\n\nNASA seeks innovative systems
modeling methods and tools to: \n\n\u2022\tDefine, develop and execute
future science missions, many of which are likely to feature designs and
 operational concepts that will pose significant challenges to existing
approaches and applications, and \n\u2022\tEnable disciplined system
analysis for the ongoing management and decision support of the space
science technology portfolio, particularly with regard to understanding
technology alternatives, relationships, priorities, timing,
availability, down-selection, maturation, investment needs, system
engineering considerations, and cost-to-benefit ratios; to examine
\u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios; and to facilitate multidisciplinary
assessment, coordination, and integration of the technology roadmaps as a
 whole.\n\nUse of System Modeling Language (SysML) is encouraged but not
 required. SysML is a general purpose graphical modeling language for
analyzing, designing and verifying complex systems that may include
hardware, software, information, personnel, procedures and facilities.
As a language, SysML represents requirements, structure, behavior, and
equations in nine different diagram types, and can represent both
hardware and software models. The language can be extended to provide
metamodels for different disciplines, and is supported by multiple
commercial tools. SysML is finding increased use throughout the agency
to support systems engineering and analysis. \nSpecific areas of
interest include the following:\n\n\u2022\tIntegration of system and
mission modeling tools with high-fidelity multidisciplinary design and
modeling tools, supporting efficient analysis methods that accommodate
uncertainty, multiple objectives, and large-scale systems - This
requires the development of robust interfaces between SysML and other
tools, including CAD\/CAE\/PDM\/PLM applications, used to support NASA
science mission development, implementation and operations. The
objective is to produce a unified environment supporting mixed
systems-level and detailed analysis during any lifecycle phase, and
rapid analysis of widely varying concepts\/configurations using
mixed-fidelity models, including geometry\/mesh-based models when
required. The human interface for such a system could be a
\u201cdashboard\u201d (web-based is highly desirable) which initially
allows for monitoring of the dataflow across a heterogeneous set of
tools and finally allows for control of the data flow between the
variety of applications.\n\u2022\tModeling and rapid integration of
programmatic, operational, and risk elements - Fully integrated system
model representations must include non-physics based constructs such as
cost, schedule, risk, operations, and organizational model elements.
Novel methods and tools to model these system attributes are critical.
In addition, approaches to integrate these in a meaningful way with
other system model elements are needed. Methods that consider the
development of these models as by-products of a collaborative and\/or
concurrent design process are particularly valuable. \n\u2022\tLibrary
of SysML models of NASA related systems - Using a library of SysML
models, engineers will be able to design their systems by reusing a set
of existing models. Too often, these engineers have to begin from
scratch the design of the systems. A library of verified and validated
models would provide a way for the engineers to design a new spacecraft
by assembling existing models that are domain specific, and therefore
easy to adapt to the target system. In order to provide for seamless
integration between SysML models each model must identify it level of
abstraction both in terms of the modeling of time (progression: no
ordering of events, qualitative ordering of events, metric time ordering
 of events) and the modeling of space (progression: lumped parameters
models, distributed parameter models). Such levels of abstraction
\u201ccertificates\u201d for SysML will help determine integration
interface requirements between any two models.\n\u2022\tProfiles for
spacecraft, space robotics, and scientific instruments - Profiles
provide a means of tailoring SysML for particular purposes. Extensions
of the language can be inserted. This allows an organization to create
domain specific constructs which extend existing SysML modeling
elements. By developing profiles for NASA domains such as Spacecraft,
Space Robotics and Scientific Instruments, powerful mechanisms will be
available to NASA systems engineers for designing future space
systems.\n\u2022\tRequirements Modeling - SysML offers requirements
modeling capabilities, thus providing ways to visualize important
requirements relationships. There is a need to combine traditional
requirements management, supported by tools including but not limited to
 DOORS and CRADLE, and SysML requirements modeling in a standardized and
 sustainable way.\n\u2022\tFunctional Modeling - The intermediate data
products between requirements and specification are detailed functional
models that identify all of the functions required to achieve the
mission profile(s). There is a critical need to model this layer as it
is a key data product to provide traceability between requirements and
implementation. \n\u2022\tModel and Modeling Process Synthesis -  As
model-based design broadens and integrates larger and more complex
models, methods for how to sequence and operate the design synthesis ,
evaluation (e.g., V&amp;V) and elaboration process will become more
important, as will considerations of how model-based processes are made
compatible with existing review and development cycles.\n",

        "topic_name": "Fault Management Technologies",
        "description": "Lead Center: MSFC\nParticipating Center(s): ARC,
 JPL\nOCT Technology Area: TA11\n\nAs science missions are given
increasingly complex goals and have more pressure to reduce operations
costs, system autonomy increases.  Fault Management (FM) is one of the
key components of system autonomy.  FM consists of the operational
mitigations of spacecraft failures.  It is implemented with spacecraft
hardware, on-board autonomous software that controls hardware, software,
 information redundancy, and ground-based software and operations
procedures. \n\nMany recent Science Mission Directorate (SMD) missions
have encountered major cost overruns and schedule slips during test and
verification of FM functions. These overruns are due to a lack of
understanding of FM functions early in the mission definition cycles and
 to FM architectures that do not provide attributes of transparency,
verifiability, fault isolation capability, or fault coverage. The NASA
FM Handbook is under development to improve the FM design, development,
verification &amp; validation and operations processes.  FM approaches,
architectures, and tools are needed to improve early understanding of
needed FM capabilities by project managers and FM engineers and to
improve the efficiency of implementing and testing FM.\n\nSpecific
objectives are to:\n\n\u2022\tImprove ability to predict FM system
complexity and estimate development and operations
costs.\n\u2022\tEnable cost-effective FM design architectures and
operations.\n\u2022\tDetermine completeness and appropriateness of FM
designs and implementations.\n\u2022\tDecrease the labor and time
required to develop and test FM models and algorithms.\n\u2022\tImprove
visualization of the full FM design across hardware, software, and
operations procedures.\n\u2022\tDetermine extent of testing required,
completeness of verification planned, and residual risk resulting from
incomplete coverage.\n\u2022\tIncrease data integrity between
multi-discipline tools.\n\u2022\tStandardize metrics and calculations
across FM, SE, S&amp;MA and operations disciplines.\n\u2022\tIncrease
reliability of FM systems.\n\nExpected outcomes are better estimation
and control of FM complexity and development costs, improved FM designs,
 and accelerated advancement of FM tools and techniques.\n\nThe approach
 of this subtopic is to seek the right balance between sufficient
reliability and cost appropriate to the mission type and risk posture.
 Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be
considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, SMD missions.
Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and
NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II
prototype demonstration.\n\nOfferors should demonstrate awareness of the
 state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage
existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where appropriate.
 \n\nSpecific technology in the forms listed below is needed to increase
 delivery of high quality FM systems. These approaches, architectures
and tools must be consistent with and enable the NASA FM Handbook
concepts and processes.\n\n\u2022\tFM design tools - System modeling and
 analyses significantly contributes to the quality of FM design;
however, the time it takes to translate system design information into
system models often decreases the value of the modeling and analysis
results.  Examples of enabling techniques and tools are modeling
automation, spacecraft modeling libraries, expedited algorithm
development, sensor placement analyses, and system model tool
integration. \n\u2022\tFM visualization tools - FM systems incorporate
hardware, software, and operations mechanisms.  The ability to visualize
 the full FM system and the contribution of each mechanism to protecting
 mission functions and assets is critical to assessing the completeness
and appropriateness of the FM design to the mission attributes (mission
type, risk posture, operations concept, etc.).  Fault trees and state
transition diagrams are examples of visualization tools that could
contribute to visualization of the full FM design.\n\u2022\tFM
verification and validation tools -  As complexity of spacecraft and
systems increases, the extensiveness of testing required to verify and
validate FM implementations can be resource intensive.  Automated test
case development, false positive\/false negative test tools, model
verification and validation tools, and test coverage risk assessments
are examples of contributing technologies.\n\u2022\tFM Design
Architectures - FM capabilities may be implemented through numerous
system, hardware, and software architecture solutions.  The FM
architecture trade space includes options such as embedded in the flight
 control software or independent onboard software; on board versus
ground-based capabilities; centralized or distributed FM functions;
sensor suite implications; integration of multiple FM techniques;
innovative software FM architectures implemented on flight processors or
 on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs); and execution in real-time
or off-line analysis post-operations.  Alternative architecture choices
could help control FM system complexity and cost and could offer
solutions to transparency, verifiability, and completeness
challenges.\n\u2022\tMulti-discipline FM Interoperation - FM designers,
Systems Engineering, Safety and Mission Assurance, and Operations
perform analyses and assessments of reliabilities, failure modes and
effects, sensor coverage, failure probabilities, anomaly detection and
response, contingency operations, etc.  The relationships between
multi-discipline data and analyses are inconsistent and misinterpreted.
 Resources are expended either in effort to resolve disconnects in data
and analyses or worse, reduced mission success due to failure modes that
 were overlooked.  Solutions that address data integrity, identification
 of metrics, and standardization of data products, techniques and
analyses will reduce cost and failures.\n",

ISS facilities for new scientific payloads or to provide on orbit
analysis to enhance capabilities. Current utilization of the ISS is
limited by available upmass, downmass, and crew time as well as by the
capabilities of the interfaces and hardware already developed.
Innovative interfaces between existing hardware and systems, which are
common to ground research, could facilitate both increased, and faster,
payload development. Technologies that are portable and that can be

GSFC, JPL\nOCT Technology Area: TA08\n\nEarth is a complex, dynamic
system we do not yet fully understand. We need to understand the Earth's
 atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere as a
single connected system. The purpose of NASA's Earth science program is
to develop a scientific understanding of Earth's system and its response
 to natural or human-induced changes, and to improve prediction of
climate, weather, and natural hazards. A major component of NASA\u2019s
Earth Science Division is a coordinated series of satellite and airborne
 missions for long-term global observations of the land surface,
biosphere, solid Earth, atmosphere, and oceans. This coordinated
approach enables an improved understanding of the Earth as an integrated
 system. NASA is completing the development and launch of a set of
Foundational missions, new Decadal Survey missions, and Climate
Continuity missions.\n\nThis subtopic seeks innovative laser
transmitters and receivers to allow accurate measurements of atmospheric
 parameters with high spatial resolution from ground and airborne
platforms. These developments require advances in the state-of-the-art
lidar technology with emphasis on compactness, efficiency, reliability,
lifetime, and high performance. This subtopic is seeking only the
innovative laser transmitter subsystem or complete receiver subsystem
for the three listed areas, which upon delivery would be infused into a
lidar system demonstration.  (Individual lidar components are NOT
solicited in this subtopic but can be submitted under theS1.01 Lidar
Remote Sensing Technologies) With the larger funded effort, NASA seeks
to have delivered a full transmitter or receiver subsystem with turnkey
operation meeting the requirements of one of the three targeted areas
below. The selected proposal(s) will be required to work closely with
the NASA customers to understand performance requirements.

radiation, stratospheric \/tropospheric exchange, and even impacts
satellite validation activities. There is a critical need for high
accuracy, high resolution water vapor measurement and its impact at the
highest altitudes. The most critical unmet need for a high-altitude a
water vapor DIAL system is a compact, rugged, and efficient tunable
laser transmitter to operate on one of the strong H2O absorptions lines
near 934.55, 935.43 or 944.11 nm (H2O line center).  Tunability over the
 side of the line up to 100 pm is needed.  Need to demonstrate the laser

including:\n\n\u2022\tLight-weight X-ray imaging mirrors for future very

light-weight mirrors for future UV\/Optical telescopes.\n\nThe 2012
National Academy report \u201cNASA Space Technology Roadmaps and

which NASA should invest over the next 5 years is developing a new
generation of larger effective aperture, lower-cost astronomical
telescopes that enable discovery of habitable planets, facilitate
advances in solar physics, and enable the study of faint structures
around bright objects. To enable this capability requires low-cost,
ultra-stable, large-aperture, normal and grazing incidence mirrors with
low mass-to-collecting area ratios. To enable these new astronomical
telescopes, the report identifies three specific optical systems
technologies:\n\n\u2022\tActive align\/control of grazing-incidence
imaging systems to achieve &lt; 1 arc-second angular
resolution.\n\u2022\tActive align\/control of normal-incidence imaging

WFE) performance.\n\u2022\tNormal incidence 4-meter (or larger) diameter
 5 nm rms WFE (300 nm system diffraction limit) mirrors.\n\nTechnical
Challenges\n\nTechnological developments at the telescope system level
are required to enable higher capability measurements, longer duration
flights and more affordable missions. The purpose of this sub-topic is
to mature demonstrated component level technologies (TRL4) to
demonstrated system level technologies (TRL6) by using them to
manufacture complete telescope systems. Examples of desired
technological advances relative to the current state of the art include,
 but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022\tReduce the areal cost of telescope

thermal\/mechanical wavefront stability and\/or pointing stability by 2X
 to 10X.\n\nSuccessful proposals shall provide a credible plan to
deliver for the allocated budget a fully assembled and tested telescope
assembly which can be integrated into a potential balloon mission to
meet a high-priority NASA science objective. Successful proposals will
demonstrate an understanding of how the engineering specifications of
their telescope meets the performance requirements and operational
envelop of a potential balloon science mission. Phase I delivery shall
be a reviewed design and manufacturing plan which demonstrates
feasibility. While detailed analysis will be conducted in Phase II, the
preliminary design should address how optical, mechanical (static and
dynamic) and thermal designs and performance analysis will be done to
show compliance with all requirements. Past experience or technology
demonstrations which support the design and manufacturing plans will be
given appropriate weight in the evaluation. Phase II delivery shall be a
 completely assembled and tested optical telescope assembly ready to be
integrated into a potential balloon mission. Testing shall confirm
compliance of the telescope assembly with its requirements.\n\nHigh
Energy Telescope\n\nA high-energy telescope is desired which includes
the collecting optic, the structure which connects the collecting optic
to the detecting instrument, and any mechanisms needed to maintain
alignment and pointing stability of the collecting optic relative to the
 detecting instrument. Collecting optic should be able to collect and
concentrate high-energy photons (above 10 keV). Collecting optics can be
 grazing incidence reflective, refractive or diffractive with a
potential focal length ranging from 4 to 10 meters. Other
\u2018optical\u2019 elements such as coded apertures can be considered.
Angular resolutions should be significantly less than 1 arcminute for
grazing-incidence optics, and ideally in the arcsecond range. Active
control of the optic figure may be necessary. For refractive
\/diffractive optics, lower resolutions are acceptable, depending on
energy. Effective collecting area should be greater than 10\u2019s cm2
at 10 keV to enable useful data from typical balloon observing times.
Higher energy \u2018optics\u2019 should provide enough area for a
significant signal during flight. Optical assemblies must ideally be
light weight to satisfy future mission demands. Total telescope mass
budget goal is 200 kg.\n\nUltra-Stable 1-meter Class UVOIR
Telescope\n\nPotential Exoplanet balloon studies require a complete
optical telescope system with 1 meter or larger of collecting aperture
to characterize exoplanets and dust disks over the range of wavelengths
from 300 to 1100 nm, and ideally as long as 1600 nm. The telescope
should be diffraction limited at 500 nm (&lt; 36 nm transmitted
wavefront) over a total field of view subtending at least 10 arc-seconds
 and over a field of regard extending from 20 to 70 \u00b0 elevation
angle with respect to the gravity vector. The wavefront error power
spectral density should monotonically decrease with increasing spatial
frequency i.e., have no strong harmonics, from 0 to 30 cycles per
aperture.\n\nDynamic wavefront stability must be &lt; 0.3 nm rms over
timescales of 100s seconds and &lt; 1 nm rms over timescales of 100s
minutes. Sources of wavefront instability include thermal variations
with boresight angle, thermal drift, coupling of residual vibration from
 reaction\/momentum wheels, residual wind effects above 100,000 ft, and
pointing induced beam shear. The telescope can achieve the stability
requirement via either passive design or an actively controlled mirror
(i.e., secondary mirror, fine steering mirror, deformable mirror,
etc.).\n\nPossible telescope configurations include, but are not limited
 to, two mirror Cassegrain and Gregorian configurations, and 3 mirror
anastigmat designs. Ideally the telescope is an unobscured off-axis
system that can function with several different types of coronagraphs.
But on-axis systems with simple secondary support spiders are allowed
for a subset of possible high-contrast instruments. The telescope should
 form a centimeter scale real pupil image after the primary mirror
vertex. The total telescope mass budget goal is 300 kg.\n\nLow-Cost CMB
Telescopes\n\nPotential balloon measurements of CMB linear polarization
desire complete 3 to 4 meter class off-axis telescope systems which are
2X lower areal cost and 2X lower areal mass than the current 2 meter
class state of the art (as represented by the BLAST telescope) with the
following optical, mechanical and operational requirements.\n\nOptical

less.\n\u2022\tRecurring production cost &lt; $200 K per
telescope.\n\nSuccessful proposals will deliver a complete preliminary
design for the telescope at the end of Phase I and two to four complete
telescope systems at the end of Phase II.\n\nLow-Cost Far-Infrared
Telescopes\n\nPotential balloon Far-Infrared missions desire complete
off-axis telescope systems which are 2X lower areal cost and 2X lower
areal mass than the current state of the art with the following optical,
 mechanical and operational requirements.\n\nOptical
requirements:\n\n\u2022\t2.5 meter to 4 meter diameter primary
mirror.\n\u2022\tDiffraction-limited performance at 100 micron
wavelength at 250 K.\n\u2022\tWavefront stability of 2.5 micrometers rms

telescope systems at the end of Phase II.\n\nCryogenic Far-Infrared
Telescope\n\nPotential Far-Infrared balloon missions achieve significant
 improvements in sensitivity using cryogenic optics. Anticipated
missions require a complete telescope system with larger collecting
apertures and lower areal mass than the current state of the art. A
cryogenic telescope is desired with 3 meter on-axis collecting aperture
maintained at temperatures below 20 K. Low mass and long cryogenic hold
time are particularly important.\n\nOptical
requirements:\n\n\u2022\tDiffraction-limited performance at 300 micron
wavelength at 20 K.\n\u2022\tF\/1 to F\/1.5 primary

GRC, GSFC, LaRC, MSFC\nOCT Technology Area: TA08\n\nThe present state of
 practice for building space systems for exploring our solar system
planets is based on the placing space craft subsystems into
environmentally protected housings that are power inefficient and bulky.
  The goal of the subtopic is to develop technologies that dramatically
change this practice resulting in the development of highly power
efficient and light weight space subsystems by developing space
subsystems that would be capable of operating directly in the extreme
environment of the planets of our solar systems.\n\nHigh Temperature,
High Pressure, and Chemically Corrosive Environments - NASA is
interested in expanding its ability to explore the deep atmosphere and
surface of Venus through the use of long-lived (days or weeks) balloons
and landers. Survivability in extreme high temperatures and high
pressures is also required for deep atmospheric probes to giant planets.
 Proposals are sought for technologies that enable the in situ
exploration of the surface and deep atmosphere of Venus and the deep
atmospheres of Jupiter or Saturn for future NASA missions. Venus
features a dense, CO2 atmosphere completely covered by sulfuric acid
clouds at about 55 km above the surface, a surface temperature of about
486 degrees Centigrade and a surface pressure of about 90 bars.
Technologies of interest include high temperature and acid resistant
high strength-to-weight textile materials for landing systems (balloons,
 parachutes, tethers, bridles, airbags), high temperature electronics
components, high temperature energy storage systems, light mass
refrigeration systems, high-temperature actuators and gear boxes for
robotic arms and other mechanisms, high temperature drills, phase change
 materials for short term thermal maintenance, low conductivity and
high-compressive strength insulation materials, high temperature optical
 window systems (that are transparent in IR, visible and UV wavelengths)
 and advanced materials with high specific heat capacity and strength
for pressure vessel construction, and pressure vessel components
compatible with materials such as steal, titanium and beryllium such as
low leak rate wide temperature (-50 degrees Centigrade to 500 degrees
Centigrade) seals capable of operating between 0 and 90 bars.\nLow
Temperature Environments - Low temperature survivability is required for
 surface missions to Titan (-180 degrees Centigrade), Europa surface
(-220 degrees Centigrade), Ganymede (-200 degrees Centigrade), near
earth objects and comets. Also the Earth's Moon equatorial regions
experience wide temperature swings from -180 degrees Centigrade to +130
degrees Centigrade during the lunar day\/night cycle, and the sustained
temperature at the shadowed regions of lunar poles can be as low as -230
 degrees Centigrade. Mars diurnal temperature changes from about -120
degrees Centigrade to +20 degrees Centigrade. Also for the baseline
concept for Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM), with a mission life of
 10 years, the radiation environment is estimated at 2.9 Mega-rad total
ionizing dose (TID) behind 100 mil thick aluminum. Proposals are sought
for technologies that enable NASA's long duration missions to low
temperature and wide temperature environments. Technologies of interests
 include low-temperature resistant high strength-weight textiles for
landing systems (parachutes, air bags), low-power and
wide-operating-temperature radiation-tolerant \/radiation hardened RF
electronics, radiation-tolerant\/radiation-hardened
low-power\/ultra-low-power wide-operating-temperature low-noise
mixed-signal electronics for space-borne system such as guidance and
navigation  avionics and instruments, radiation-tolerant

advanced electronics assembly), low to medium power actuators, gear
boxes, lubricants and energy storage sources capable of operating across
 an ultra-wide temperature range from -230 degrees Centigrade to 200
degrees Centigrade and Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools for modeling
and predicting the electrical performance, reliability, and life cycle
for low-temperature electronic\/ electro-mechanical systems and
components.\n\nResearch should be conducted to demonstrate technical
feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II

\u2013 The $1000 Genome",
        "description": "\n\t1. Research
Objectives\n\t\n\tPurpose\n\n\tThe National Human Genome Research
Institute (NHGRI) solicits Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR
[R43\/R44]) grant applications to demonstrate feasibility and develop
novel technologies that will enable extremely low-cost, high quality DNA
 sequencing.&amp;nbsp; This FOA continues a program that began in 2004,
when the cost to produce a high quality draft mammalian genome sequence
was estimated at $5 to $10 million, and the goal was to reduce costs by
four orders of magnitude &amp;ndash; to approximately $1,000 &amp;ndash;
 in ten years.\n\n\tWhile substantial progress toward the $1,000 genome
has been made, daunting scientific and technical challenges
remain.&amp;nbsp; This program will continue to support both fundamental
 scientific investigation underlying the technologies, and their
engineering, to achieve this goal.&amp;nbsp; The program supports
development of key system components and of full systems.&amp;nbsp; In
this context, &amp;lsquo;key components&amp;rsquo; refers to the method
for determining the linear order of nucleotides, in contrast to upstream
 or downstream steps in sequencing.&amp;nbsp; Exploration of methods
other than those currently being pursued as potential $1,000 genome
technologies is encouraged.&amp;nbsp; High-risk\/high-payoff proposals
are appropriate to achieve the goals of this FOA by approximately
2014.\n\n\tParallel FOAs of identical scientific scope (RFA-HG-10-012
and RFA-HG-10-013) solicit applications under the R01 and R21 grant
programs.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tThe ability to sequence complete genomes
and the free dissemination of sequence data have dramatically changed
the nature of biological and biomedical research.&amp;nbsp; Sequence and
 other genomic data have the potential to lead to remarkable improvement
 in many facets of human life and society, including the understanding,
diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease; advances in agriculture,
 environmental science and remediation; and our understanding of
evolution and ecological systems.\n\n\tThe ability to sequence many
genomes completely has been made possible by the enormous reduction of
the cost of sequencing in the past 30 years, from tens of dollars per
base in the 1980s to a fraction of a cent per base today.&amp;nbsp; We
have progressed from the early Human Genome Project goals to sequence
the genomes of the human and mouse and a few additional model organisms
(E. coli, C. elegans and D. melanogaster), through programs to sequence
at varying pre-determined quality levels numerous genomes across the
evolutionary tree including multiple species and variants for some of
those, to current programs to sequence portions or the entire genomes of
 increasing numbers of tumors and human individuals.&amp;nbsp;
Technology advances, and in particular the recent emergence of a new
generation of sequencing systems, have enabled the launch of several
such projects that are producing stunning insights into biology and
disease.&amp;nbsp; Nevertheless, the cost to completely sequence large
numbers of entire genomes remains too high to allow complete genome
sequencing to be used routinely, and we remain far from achieving the
low costs and high quality needed to enable the use of comprehensive
genomic sequence information in individual health care.\n\n\tA few
examples of high priority research to which genomic sequencing at high
quality and dramatically reduced cost would make vital contributions
include:\n\n\t\n\t\tComparative genomic analyses across species to yield
 insights into the structure and function of the human genome and,
consequently, the genetics of human health and disease;\n\t\n\t\tStudies
 of human genetic variation and its relationship to health and disease,
in large numbers of individuals, that capture not only common single
nucleotide variation but also rare, copy number, and structural variants
 that are increasingly thought to play an important role in complex
disease;\n\t\n\t\tCharacterization of somatic changes in the genome that
 contribute to cancer, revealing information from large numbers of
matched tumor\/normal samples on a genome-wide basis rather than
restricting analysis to &amp;ldquo;suspect&amp;rdquo; genomic regions
that are based on incomplete knowledge;\n\t\n\t\tAdditional genome
sequences of agriculturally important animals and plants that are needed
 to study individual variation, different domesticated breeds and wild
variants of each species; and\n\t\n\t\tSequence analysis of microbial
communities, many members of which cannot be cultured.&amp;nbsp; This
will provide a rich source of medically and environmentally useful
information.&amp;nbsp; Accurate, rapid sequencing may also be the best
approach to microbial monitoring of food and the environment, including
rapid detection and mitigation of bioterrorism threats.\n\n\n\tThe broad
 utility and high importance of dramatically reducing DNA sequencing
costs prompted the NHGRI, in 2004, to embark on two parallel technology
development programs (Nature Biotech. 26:1113, 2008). &amp;nbsp;The
first had the objective of reducing the cost of producing a high quality
 sequence of a mammalian-sized genome by two orders of magnitude, to
about $100,000.&amp;nbsp; This goal has been achieved so no additional
grant applications are being solicited at this time.&amp;nbsp; Rather,
the NHGRI is focusing its efforts on attaining the goal of the second
program, which, as described in this FOA and parallel FOAs for other
grant mechanisms, is the development of technologies with which to
sequence a human genome for about $1,000 (a four order of magnitude cost
 reduction).&amp;nbsp; Implicit in this goal is the quality of the
expected sequence product, as sequencing cost targets are meaningless
without associated quality standards as described below.\n\n\tSequencing
 Strategy and Quality\n\n\tThe sequencing technology that was used to
produce the reference human genome sequence (Nature 431:931, 2004;
Nature 409:860, 2001; Science 291:1304, 2001) was fluorescence detection
 of dideoxynucleotide-terminated DNA extension reactions resolved by
capillary array electrophoresis (CAE).&amp;nbsp; Individual sequence
&amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; segments can be as long as 1000
nucleotides.&amp;nbsp; If all of the DNA in a 3 Gb genome were unique,
it would be possible to determine the sequence of the entire genome by
generating a sufficient number (tens of millions) of
randomly-overlapping 1000-base reads and aligning their
overlaps.&amp;nbsp; However, the human and the majority of other
interesting genomes contain a substantial amount of repetitive
DNA.&amp;nbsp; To cope with the complexities of repetitive DNA elements
and to assemble the thousand-base reads in the correct long-range order
across the genome, genomic sequencing methods involve a variety of
additional strategies, such as the sequencing of both ends of cloned DNA
 fragments, use of libraries of cloned fragments of specified lengths,
incorporation of map information, achievement of substantial redundancy
(multiple reads of each nucleotide from overlapping fragments) and
application of sophisticated assembly algorithms to filter and align the
 reads.&amp;nbsp; As new sequencing technologies are developed, they
must incorporate means to deal with these features of the structure of
the genome.\n\n\tThe gold standard for genomic sequencing is based on
the above-described methods and remains =99.99% accuracy (not more than
one error per 10,000 nucleotides) with essentially no gaps
(http:\/\/www.genome.gov\/10000923).&amp;nbsp; The
&amp;ldquo;finishing&amp;rdquo; steps needed to achieve that very high
quality have not been automated and thus require substantial
hand-crafting.&amp;nbsp; However, experience shows that much comparative
 and medically useful sequence information can be obtained from
automatically generated sequence assemblies that are known as
&amp;ldquo;high-quality draft&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;comparative
grade.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; Therefore, the cost targets for
NHGRI&amp;rsquo;s sequencing technology development programs were
originally defined in terms of a mammalian-sized genome with a sequence
quality equivalent to or better than that of the mouse draft assembly
published in December 2002 (Nature 420:520, 2002).&amp;nbsp; Producing
such a product for $1,000 is still not possible, so this remains a
useful and challenging technology target.&amp;nbsp; However, it is
critical to note that the ultimate need, for medical research and
individualized medicine, will be for far higher quality sequence of the 3
 Gb diploid human genome\n\n\tSubsequent to dideoxy\/CAE sequencing, a
second generation of sequencing technologies has been developed and
implemented.&amp;nbsp; These are broadly described as array-based
methods in which large numbers of templates are extended one base at a
time, the extensions are detected, and that cycle is repeated (reviewed
in Nature Biotechnology October 2008).&amp;nbsp; These technologies
enable the sequencing of larger numbers of genomes for under $100,000
dollars each, and even less for targeted sequencing of particular
genomic regions.&amp;nbsp; While challenges remain related to producing
and interpreting sequence information using these technologies, they are
 proving invaluable to the biomedical research enterprise and they
validate the impetus toward further substantial decreases in cost with
increases in quality, throughput and speed of genomic
sequencing.\n\n\tThe eventual goal of these programs is to achieve
technologies that can produce assembled sequence of genomes that had not
 been previously sequenced (i.e., de novo sequencing).&amp;nbsp;
However, an accompanying goal is to obtain highly accurate sequence data
 at the single base level that can be overlain on a reference sequence
of the organism (i.e., re-sequencing).&amp;nbsp; This could be achieved,
 for example, with short reads that lack information linking them to
other reads.&amp;nbsp; In spite of shortcomings (some of which are
described below), re-sequencing would potentially be available sooner
and of considerable value for certain studies on disease etiology and
individualized medicine.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, technology development for
 re-sequencing will be supported under this FOA.&amp;nbsp; As the cost
goal for the more difficult challenge, de novo assembly sequencing, is
$1,000, the goal for re-sequencing is to develop technologies that will
provide a genome&amp;rsquo;s worth of less-well-mapped sequence for well
 below $1,000.\n\n\tFor re-sequencing, the per-base accuracy must be
sufficient to distinguish between sequencing errors and real
polymorphism.&amp;nbsp; Additional challenges include assigning reads to
 gene families with very similar sequence, the identification of copy
number changes and genomic rearrangements, and the identification of
haplotypes (i.e., linear juxtapositioning of particular single
nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] alleles along a single chromosome) in
diploid organisms.&amp;nbsp; Thus, in proposing the development of
re-sequencing technologies, it is essential that the applicant clearly
address the extent to which the proposed technology will meet or fall
short of these various challenges, and the cost tradeoffs that justify
developing the technology to produce data of high value for particular
biomedical studies.\n\n\tResearch and Scope\n\n\tThe goal of research
supported under this FOA is to develop new or improved technology to
enable rapid, efficient DNA sequencing of mammalian-sized
genomes.&amp;nbsp; The target cost for a 3 Gb diploid genome sequence
determined at reasonably high quality is about $1,000 because the
ability to generate routinely complete genomic sequences at that cost
would revolutionize biological research and medicine.\n\n\tBoth
fundamental scientific discovery and cutting edge engineering will
likely be needed to achieve these goals.&amp;nbsp; For example, new
sensing and detection modalities and fabrication methods may be
required, and the physics of systems operating at nm length scales will
need to be better understood.&amp;nbsp; It is therefore anticipated that
 proposals responding to this FOA will involve fundamental and
engineering research conducted by multidisciplinary teams of
investigators.&amp;nbsp; The guidance for budget requests accommodates
the formation of groups having investigators at several institutions, in
 cases where that is needed to assemble a team of the appropriate
balance, breadth and experience.\n\n\tThe scientific and technical
challenges inherent in achieving the cost goals are significant.
Achieving these goals may require research projects that entail
substantial risk.&amp;nbsp; That risk should be balanced by an
outstanding scientific and management plan designed to achieve the very
high payoff goals of this solicitation.&amp;nbsp; High-risk\/high-payoff
 projects may fail for legitimate reasons, so applicants proposing such
projects should identify them as such, elaborate key quantitative
milestones to be achieved, and describe the consequences of not
achieving those milestones in a reasonable period of
time.\n\n\tApplicants may propose to develop full-scale sequencing
systems or investigate key components of such systems.&amp;nbsp; For the
 latter, applicants must describe how the knowledge gained as a result
of the proposed project would be incorporated into a full system that
they or others might subsequently propose to develop.&amp;nbsp; Such
independent proposals are an important path for pursuing novel,
high-risk\/high-payoff ideas, short of developing a full
system.\n\n\tWhile the major focus of this program is on the development
 of new technologies for detection of nucleotide sequence, any
successful technology will have to address matters related to the
practical implementation of the technologies so that the technology can
form the basis of, or be incorporated into, an efficient, high quality,
high-throughput DNA sequencing scheme.&amp;nbsp; Any new technology will
 eventually need to be incorporated effectively into a sequencing
workflow, starting with a biological sample and ending with sequence
data of the desired quality.&amp;nbsp; Sample preparation requirements
can depend upon the detection method which, in turn, can affect the way
in which output data are handled.&amp;nbsp; If a full system development
 is proposed, these issues should be addressed on an appropriate
schedule in the research plan; applicants should focus as early as
possible in the research plan on the most critical and highest-risk
aspects of the project related to determining the sequence of
nucleotides, on which the rest of the project depends.&amp;nbsp;
Projects to address key components must address the fundamental method
of determining the base sequence (that is, a proposal addressing only
sample prep or only the downstream informatics would not be considered
responsive to this FOA).\n\n\tMost technology developers lack practical
experience in high-throughput sequencing and in testing of methods and
instruments for robust, routine sequencing operation.&amp;nbsp;
Applicants may therefore wish to include such expertise as they develop
their teams.&amp;nbsp; Academic investigators may wish to consider
collaborating with commercial entities that have the experience and
capabilities to bring practical systems into the hands of
users.\n\n\tThe quality of sequence to be generated by the technology is
 of paramount importance for this solicitation.&amp;nbsp; Two major
factors contributing to genomic sequence quality are per-base accuracy
and contiguity of the assembly.&amp;nbsp; Much of the utility of
comparative sequence information will derive from characterization of
sequence variation between species, and between individuals of a
species.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, per-base accuracy must be high enough to
discern polymorphism at the single-nucleotide level (substitutions,
insertions, deletions) and distinguish polymorphism from sequencing
errors.&amp;nbsp; Experience and resulting policy have established a
target accuracy of not more than one error per 10,000 bases.&amp;nbsp;
All applications in response to this FOA, whether to develop
re-sequencing or de novo sequencing technologies, must propose to
achieve at least this standard.\n\n\tAssembly information is needed for
determining sequence of new genomes and ultimately also for genomes for
which a reference sequence exists, to detect rearrangements, insertions,
 deletions, and copy number changes.&amp;nbsp; All of these are genomic
changes have been shown to be associated with disease, and knowledge of
rearrangements can reveal new biological mechanisms.&amp;nbsp; The phase
 of single nucleotide polymorphisms to define haplotypes is important in
 understanding and diagnosing disease.&amp;nbsp; Achieving a high level
of sequence contiguity may be essential to achieve the full benefit from
 the use of sequencing for individualized medicine, e.g., to evaluate
genomic contributions to risk for specific diseases and syndromes, and
drug responsiveness.&amp;nbsp; Nevertheless, it is recognized that
perfect sequence assembly from end to end of each chromosome is unlikely
 to be achievable with most technologies in a fully automated fashion
and without adding considerable cost.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, for the
purpose of this solicitation, grant applications proposing technology
development for de novo sequencing shall describe how they will achieve,
 for about $1,000, a draft-quality assembly that is at least comparable
to that represented by the mouse draft sequence produced by December
2002:&amp;nbsp; 7.7-fold coverage, 6.5-fold coverage in Q20 bases,
assembled into 225,000 sequence contigs connected by at least two
read-pair links into supercontigs [total of 7,418 supercontigs at least 2
 kb long], with N50 length for contigs equal to 24.8 kb and for
supercontigs equal to 16.9 Mb (Nature 420:520, 2002).&amp;nbsp; Grant
applications that propose technology development for re-sequencing
should fully describe the qualities and characteristics of the genomic
sequence information that the technology would produce, and the
projected cost.&amp;nbsp; That cost should be at least four orders of
magnitude lower than was the cost to produce comparable quality data in
2004, when this program was initiated.\n\n\tGrant applications will be
evaluated, and funding decisions made, in such a way as to develop a
balanced portfolio that has strong potential to develop both robust de
novo and re-sequencing technologies, exploring a variety of technology
approaches. If the estimate is correct, that achieving the goal of
$1,000 de novo genome sequencing incorporating substantial assembly
information will be achieved by about 2014, then low-cost re-sequencing
technologies for even lower cost might be expected in a shorter time.
Projects with a plan to achieve re-sequencing while on the path to de
novo sequencing will receive priority.\n\n\tResearch conducted under
this FOA may include development of the computational tools associated
with the technology, e.g., to extract sequence information, including
image analysis and signal processing, and to evaluate sequence quality
and assign confidence scores.&amp;nbsp; It may also address strategies
to assemble the sequence from the information being obtained from the
technology or by merging the sequence data with information from
parallel technology.&amp;nbsp; Applications that incorporate effective
plans to develop systems that address the bioinformatics challenges in
concert with the sequencing wet-ware will receive high priority
consideration.&amp;nbsp; However, this FOA will not support development
of sequence assembly or sequence analysis software independent of
technology development to obtain the linear nucleotide
sequence.\n\n\tThis program is aimed at technology to sequence entire
genomes.&amp;nbsp; Projects are under way to determine sequence from
selected important regions (e.g., all of the genes).&amp;nbsp; Grant
applications that propose to meet the cost targets by sequencing only
selected regions of a genome will be considered unresponsive to this
FOA.&amp;nbsp; However, applications that propose novel ways to sequence
 selected genomic regions, cost-effectively, while on a path to
whole-genome sequencing, will be considered to be responsive.\n\n\tNHGRI
 is interested in supporting diverse approaches to achieving the goals
of this FOA.&amp;nbsp; To assist the research community, investigators
who are pursuing one set of technology paths that involve the use of
nanopores and nanogaps published an overview of the challenges they face
 (Nature Biotech. 26:1146, 2008).&amp;nbsp; Similarly, challenges
attending sequencing by synthesis have been described (Nature Biotech.
27:1013, 2009). Proposals to meet these and related challenges, and
proposals to pursue alternative technologies, are welcome under this
FOA.&amp;nbsp; Information on projects funded under earlier versions of
this and related FOAs and a program bibliography are available at

Nervous System",
        "description": "\n\tThe purpose of this funding opportunity is
to facilitate the development of small molecule probes that will add a
pharmacological dimension to basic neuroscience work, and enable
proof-of-principle studies linking nervous system therapeutic targets,
mechanisms or phenotypes to disease onset or progression.\n\n\tNIH has
made a significant commitment to probe development via
Institute-specific and Blueprint for Neuroscience
(http:\/\/neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov\/) support, and via Roadmap
Programs associated with the Molecular Libraries Initiative
(http:\/\/nihroadmap.nih.gov\/molecularlibraries\/). For example,
Molecular Libraries Programs fund the development of novel in vitro
screening assays (see:
http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/pa-files\/PAR-08-024.html).
These assays can then be used to identify small molecule interactors
(hits) in automated, high-throughput screening (HTS) of large, small
molecule collections such as the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule
Repository (http:\/\/mlsmr.glpg.com). These screening projects are
performed in centers belonging to the Molecular Libraries Probe
Production Centers Network (http:\/\/www.mli.nih.gov), as well as in a
variety of screening centers established in recent years to address the
need to develop small molecule probes as aids to hypothesis-driven
research investigation, as imaging agents, and as therapeutic leads.
This effort by the scientific community to automate and screen novel
assays against small molecule diversity collections has created a large
portfolio of neuroscience-related small molecule probe development
projects. This FOA will provide a bridging step between these medium and
 high-throughput automated screening efforts to find small molecule
interactors, and the insertion of optimized probes derived from these
compounds into pharmacological studies aimed at gaining a better
understanding of nervous system function, and dysfunction leading to
disease states.\n\n\tSuccessful compound screening efforts to identify
small molecules typically progress to early chemistry optimization work
(the generation of analogues) in order to identify features of these
template molecules that contribute to the useful attributes needed in a
small molecule probe, such as affinity and selectivity for a target. At
the completion of this step of early structure-activity-relationship
(SAR) studies SBCs will have employed distinct small molecule hits that
interact with their biological target to generate and test some small
molecule analogues, with the aim of identifying structural features of
the hit that are important to its activity. As a result, plans can be
proposed for further chemical synthesis to create advanced analogues in
which the biological attributes needed in a useful probe are improved.
In vitro screening assays available in the SBC principal investigators
laboratory that have been miniaturized and optimized could be used to
support a medium-throughput screening effort aimed at rapidly
characterizing the properties of these compounds. \n\n\tMany probe
development projects that have succeeded in identifying chemicals
possessing the basic attributes of the small molecule probe(s) they are
seeking will require a continued biological screening and chemistry
effort over 1-2 years to optimize these molecules so that useful probes
are the end result. This FOA will provide the resources that allow a SBC
 to successfully identify the small molecule probe (and\/or lead
compound series) that is the goal of their assay development, screening,
 and SAR study effort. The Program specifically funds completion of the
small molecule probe development when additional time and resources are
needed, aims to facilitate the formation of biology and medicinal
chemistry partnerships to achieve this, and encourages the use of
efficient cheminformatic strategies for compound acquisition and
semi-custom synthesis. At the end of the project the investigator should
 be able to insert these pharmacological tools into their ongoing
research Program as investigative tools and pharmacological imaging
agents. An emphasis will be placed on the funding of small molecule
probe development projects that are focused on novel nervous system
targets and mechanisms for which small molecule probes and therapeutic
leads are not currently available, or, projects where the currently
available compounds are not optimal for the proposed use.
\n\n\tApplications should include both a biological and chemical
component. The biological component should include a plan of in vitro
and, when appropriate, limited in vivo assays, each capable of measuring
 the activity of a test compound towards an attribute that the hit
compound proposed as a starting point for modification possesses, and
that needs to be further enhanced or eliminated by redesign of the hit.
Examples of possible biological test activities are listed below.
Applications are expected to provide a description of the final small
molecule probe that is the target of design, including a detailed
description of needed attributes such as affinity, activity and\/or
selectivity, and a description of how this will be measured (for
example: the use of measures of affinity or activity such as Ki or IC50
and\/or fold-selectivity comparing two target affinity or activity
values). The chemistry component should include a description of the hit
 scaffold molecules that will be the starting point of design, as well
as information about known structure-activity relationships for these
hits and the needed values for key compound attributes. A plan for the
design of analogues of these small molecule hits should be provided that
 includes a description of the strategy and approach for optimizing
molecules, and decision-making criteria for continuing, or stopping,
work on a compound series. An appropriate biological component of a
project that could be candidate for the Program might address (but is
not limited to) the following topic areas in neurobiology, and would be
expected to fit within the interests of the participating NIH
Institutes:\n\n\t\n\t\tMolecular targets expressed in the nervous system
 and measured via biochemical or cell-based assays of activity, or, via
cell-based assays of cellular signaling or biosynthetic pathway
activation.\n\t\n\t\tCellular or molecular phenotypes relevant to
nervous system function.\n\t\n\t\tGene expression in the nervous system,
 including effects on transcription, translation or RNA
splicing.\n\t\n\t\tProtein:protein interactions important to neural or
glial cell signaling.\n\t\n\t\tNervous system function modeled in
organisms such as yeast, drosophila, C. elegans and
zebrafish.\n\t\n\t\tPotential therapeutic targets associated with the
pathophysiology and\/or treatment of neurological disorders, aging
disorders, alcohol and substance abuse disorders, mental disorders (to
include: disorders of mood, anxiety, eating or obsessive-compulsive
behavior; schizophrenia; fragile x; autism) and eye disorders involving
nervous system impairment.\n\n\n\tThe in vitro testing methodologies
proposed would be expected to have already been developed, characterized
 and implemented in a medium or high-throughput screening (HTS) Program
in which hit compounds to the proposed target were identified and
characterized. Investigators can refer to the Assay Development for HTS
Program announcement
(http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/pa-files\/PAR-08-024.html) for a
 description of performance criteria useful in developing assays that
would be suitable for use in a small molecule probe optimization plan.
The investigator should be capable of running these assays at a
throughput that would support the proposed chemical analogue testing
program. An appropriate tier of screening assays should be proposed and
prioritized (both in terms of sequence and frequency) such as to provide
 test information (eg; IC50, Ki) about chemical analogues for the
different attributes to be encompassed in the probe design. It is
generally expected that project applications will have the ability to
test 20-40 compounds every two months. A further, small molecule probe
confirmation assay can be proposed as a final validation step to
demonstrate its utility in the system in which it will be used.
\n\n\tThe proposed medicinal chemistry design for the Program would be
expected to address (but is not limited to) the following
components:\n\n\t\n\t\tOne or more distinct small molecules that have
been identified via a medium or high-throughput screening effort as
possessing the principal probe attribute, as measured by interaction in
the primary biological screening assay and further confirmed via repeat
dose-response testing (or, testing of the same activity but in an
alternative format), testing of previously undissolved compound, and
physical-chemical structural confirmation. Test values for additional
attributes to be included in the probe improvement plan should also be
provided in the hit profile. \n\t\n\t\tA design plan proposing small
molecule chemical analogues of the hit structure that is based upon
structure-activity-relationship (SAR) information, obtained from an
initial effort to acquire chemical analogues that relate discrete
changes in structure of the molecule to changes in its important
biological properties. This plan can include proposals to further
explore structure-activity relationships of the hit molecule and its
related structures, as well as the SAR of related chemical scaffolds
which resemble, yet are different from the original hit structure.
However, the aim of the planning should be to improve the requisite
biological attributes of the starting hit molecule to meet the design
objectives for developing a useful molecular probe. It is expected that
this will require the iterative design and testing of chemical
analogues. A model for such a design plan could be based on biased array
 design and synthesis, and require the design, acquisition and testing
of ~20-40 chemical analogues every 2 months.\n\t\n\t\tA small molecule
probe design capability: It is expected that expert medicinal chemistry
will be included in the proposal for the design of small molecule
analogues in support of SAR studies and compound optimization, but not
to a significant extent for the support of synthesis, which is expected
to be guided substantially by external procurement as described in the
text that follows. The NIH Institutes participating in this Program
acknowledge the importance of medicinal chemistry expertise in design
and optimization as a critical component of the research proposal, and
will therefore support funding allowance within the proposal for
attaining such expertise. Some potential applicants may be in need of,
or seeking, medicinal chemistry expertise. For those applicants needing
assistance in identifying experts to work with, upon request, the
Program Director will provide a listing, of medicinal chemists that have
 expressed interest in providing this design support service under this
program as an active participant in both the application planning and
proposed studies. The applicant would be responsible for contacting
consultants from the list to develop a detailed plan for expert
involvement in chemical design. Applicants that have already identified
and have access to appropriate medicinal chemical expertise to guide
probe development are not required or otherwise obligated to obtain the
list or to consult with anyone on the list to develop their proposal.
\n\t\n\t\tA small molecule acquisition strategy: The use of
cheminformatic strategies to search for and acquire small molecule
analogues identified in the design effort is highly encouraged as a
means of efficient and inexpensive compound acquisition from commercial
suppliers. Investigators can include in their applications the use of
cheminformatic systems currently in use. One such web-based capability
are chemical procurement resources provided by the company
ChemNavigator, some of which have been newly developed with support of
the National Cancer Institute and now available to NIH-funded
investigators without cost (http:\/\/www.chemnavigator.com\/nih.asp).
These resources include capabilities for searching currently available
analogues, and for semi-custom synthesis and procurement of compounds
(SCSORS: Semi-Custom Synthesis On-line Request System). It is expected
that procurement and testing of newly designed analogues will be
obtained from sources such as ChemNavigator and, for the most part, will
 not involve de novo synthesis. \n\n\n\tSmall molecule probe
optimization supported through the R43 mechanism will be funded with up
to $150,000 in direct costs each year for a period of up to two years.
Projects funded with the R43 mechanism will emphasize the development of
 highly innovative small molecule probes and therapeutic leads that are
not currently available. Some degree of risk is acceptable, particularly
 if innovation is high. It is expected that preliminary data will be
provided in the application demonstrating that the small molecule probe
candidate(s) can be developed within the project period. In addition,
experimental plans aimed at the design, acquisition and testing of
chemical analogues, leading to the development of small molecule probes,
 must be well defined in the project proposal. Applicants may propose
limited follow-up studies to assess the utility of a potential probe or
advanced probe candidates in the system of interest, including in vivo
models. \n\n\tApplicants proposing a broader program of discovery,
development and preclinical testing of novel compounds (to include small
 molecule probes developed in the current program) are directed to the
PAR-07-049 (R21) and PAR-07-048 (R01) announcements. These links are:

        "topic_name": "Directed Stem Cell Differentiation for Cell-Based
 Therapies for Heart, Lung, and Blood Diseases",
        "description": "\n\tThe purpose of this Funding Opportunity
Announcement (FOA) is to define the factors and mechanisms controlling
the differentiation of embryonic or adult stem or progenitor cells,
either in vitro or in vivo. The FOA is designed to stimulate new
scientific advances in stem cell differentiation including technology
research that may not be hypothesis driven. The long-range goal of this
program is the development of methods to direct the differentiation or
development of stem cells along specific cell lineages to yield
replacement cells for clinical use, whether the replacement cells are
formed in vitro for delivery or formed in vivo in the tissue or organ
environment. \n\n\tBasic research has identified stem cells or
progenitor cells with potential applications for the repair or
regeneration of heart, blood vessels, lung, and blood tissues. However,
in order to utilize these stem or progenitor cells for reparative or
regenerative therapeutic strategies, it will be necessary to
differentiate and expand these cells into specific cell lineages and in
sufficient quantities. Cells suitable for cell based therapy need to (1)
 provide robust and persistent engraftment to repair injury or correct
genetic disease; (2) undergo tissue specific differentiation, either
prior to transplantation or in vivo, and; (3) be expandable to the scale
 required for clinical application. Safety considerations are paramount,
 including a lack of tumor formation and the prevention of germ line
transmission. Stem cell differentiation likely involves critical
pairings of cell types essential to lineage specification. Therefore,
the influence of resident cells on the stem cell in the microenvironment
 of the niche must be assessed.\n\n\tOur understanding of stem cell
differentiation and development has been limited by the complexity of
the biology. Prior research on individual growth factors, signaling
molecules, or extracellular matrix components has been insufficient to
define the factors and conditions required for the production of
differentiated cells in sufficient number for clinical use or to
stimulate appropriate differentiation in situ. Advances in stem cell
biology, including the identification of key molecules regulating
self-renewal and differentiation and the establishment of new model
systems, provide opportunities to address this roadblock and to
stimulate the field.\n\n\tCritical elements that control the
proliferation versus differentiation choices of resident heart,
vascular, lung, and blood stem or progenitor cells need to be
understood. This information is of paramount importance to devising and
successfully implementing cell-based therapies for heart, vascular,
lung, and blood diseases. Cell-based therapies could impact treatment of
 diseases such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, end-stage
emphysema, and the repair of atherosclerotic vessels. The availability
of lineage-specific blood cells could lead to novel replenishment
therapies including the establishment of either immune competence or
immune tolerance.\n\n\tThis announcement focuses on elucidating and
defining factors that direct cell differentiation of stem or progenitor
cells, of embryonic or adult origin, into defined pathways or cell
lineages and maintaining that differentiated state. Knowledge of these
factors should provide us with the ability to differentiate and expand
stem and progenitor cells into the required cell lineages and in the
quantities required for cell-based therapies so that promising advances
can be applied clinically.\n\n\tResearch Topics\n\n\tResearch topics are
 intended to provide a perspective on the scope of research that would
meet the objectives of this program. It is not required that all or any
of these topics be included. Applicants are encouraged to consider other
 topics that are relevant to the goals of this FOA. Examples of research
 topics include but are not limited to those listed
below:\n\n\t\n\t\tIdentify and characterize lung or heart stem or
progenitor cells and establish lineage of specific heart and lung cell
types.\n\t\n\t\tDefine vascular progenitor cells and assess their
potential for vascular differentiation.\n\t\n\t\tDetermine methods and
conditions to differentiate blood stem cells into platelets, red cells, T
 cells or other blood products for transfusion medicine and other
applications.\n\t\n\t\tDefine the factors and mechanisms that control
the differentiation of stem or progenitor cell into specific cell
subtypes.\n\t\n\t\tDefine conditions for expansion of stem or progenitor
 cells in vitro and in vivo into defined lineages for use in biologic,
pharmacologic, tissue engineering, gene transfer, or other
protocols.\n\t\n\t\tElucidate the influence of the stem cell niche or
microenvironment on stem cell self-renewal and
differentiation.\n\t\n\t\tAssess the role of accessory cells, e.g.,
mesenchymal or stromal cells, and their potential to form differentiated
 cells.\n\t\n\t\tInvestigate the use of novel stem cell factors, e.g.,
wnt pathway, hoxB4 and homologues, and notch pathway, for cell expansion
 and differentiation.\n\t\n\t\tDevelop methodologies to isolate,
characterize, and purify differentiated cell
lineages.\n\t\n\t\tInvestigate the potential for tumor formation, germ
line transmission or other safety issues.\n\t\n\t\tAssess the role of
stem cell donor age, gender, risk factors, or disease status on
differentiation and function of cells derived.\n\n",

        "topic_name": "Multiplex Assay Development for Arthritis and
Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases",
        "description": "\n\tBackground: \n\n\tThe National Institute of
Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) is interested in
 SBIR projects to develop multiplex assay methodologies for candidate
biomarkers of musculoskeletal, rheumatic and skin diseases. The assay
technologies are intended to enable accurate quantitative measurement of
 multiple candidate biomarkers in small volumes of blood or other body
fluid or small biopsies. Many of the diseases within the NIAMS mission
are chronic and very complex in nature. The slow development and
progression leads to variable spectra of circulating biological markers
(usually breakdown or biosynthesis products) that could be used, in
combination, as markers of disease state. Biological resources to
evaluate these biomarkers are in limited supply and in most cases,
non-renewable. Treatment strategies to prevent, arrest or reverse many
of these diseases are not available, partly because laboratory tests to
predict disease onset or progression or to determine whether therapies
may be altering the disease course are limited for many of these
diseases. There are expectations of improved diagnosis and
prognostication leading toward personalized medicine and targeted
treatments based on test results.\n\n\tEmerging proteomic and genomic
technologies have the potential to identify and quantify novel markers
in biospecimens that, in combination, can function as biomarkers of the
presence or severity of clinical disease states. Multiplex arrays that
simultaneously measure multiple biomarkers can be useful in disease
screening and assessing disease risk, severity, and prognosis. Use of
such platforms saves time, cost, sample consumption, and reagent volumes
 while increasing sample throughput relative to single biomarker
measurement. The use of single biomarker assays has been widespread for a
 variety of diseases and found to be limited. A multi-marker approach is
 more useful in deriving information about the diverse physiologic
pathways that contribute to diseases activity.\n\n\tThe field of
biomarkers has grown extensively over the past decade in many disease
areas, and biomarkers are currently being studied in many academic
centers and in industry. However, few single biomarkers have reached the
 stage of utility in routine clinical practice. With many disorders it
is likely that a panel of biomarkers will be required to properly
characterize the stage and\/or nature of disease. Because of this, the
development of high-throughput multiplex assays that are capable of
producing highly accurate quantitative data to meet the requirements of
the clinical laboratory is needed. At present, few assays for multiple
biomarkers are available in the multiplex format that would allow high
throughput of a large number of specimens for the clinical
proof-of-concept studies that are needed. Most of these are plagued with
 lack of sensitivity and reproducibility, high variability and
correlation of variances, and non-specific binding. The goal of this
proposal is to develop multiplex assay platforms that overcome the above
 limitations. These platforms can be antibody or other capture method
based but must be scalable and amenable to high throughput formats.
Diseases that have a mixed course of progression would benefit greatly
from easy characterization of a wide spectrum of biomarkers. Examples
include but are not limited to osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis,
SLE, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and
development of implant wear following hip and knee replacement
surgeries. It is critical that these new assays are standardized and
validated against existing individual assays and show clinically
relevant response to treatments.\n\n\tObjectives:\n\n\tThe NIAMS seeks
projects to apply state-of-the-art multiplex technologies for the
measurement of multiple candidate biomarkers in small volumes of body
fluid or small tissue biopsies. New technologies are now available that
simultaneously identify a wide spectrum of biomarkers and save time and
costs. Successful applicants will provide the types of technology
platforms used for the assay, the types of molecules the assay can
detect (protein, RNA, DNA, etc.), the ability of the assay to precisely
quantify multiple biomarker candidates in small quantities of
biospecimens, and the ability to incorporate new candidate biomarkers
into the assay as they become available.\n\n\tPhase I applications
should address initial development and feasibility testing of the
multiplex platforms and Phase II applications should be focused on
completing the development of the technology for incorporation into the
clinic.\n",

        "description": "\n\tThe purpose of this funding opportunity
(FOA) is to improve hearing health care outcomes and reduce health
disparities through the development and commercialization of improved
devices for hearing health care (HHC).&amp;nbsp; For the purposes of
this FOA, &amp;ldquo;hearing health care&amp;rdquo; is defined as
assessment and access to hearing aids and nonmedical treatment,
including hearing screening and hearing assessment as well as acquiring
an appropriate device and services for the individual&amp;rsquo;s
hearing loss and communication needs.&amp;nbsp; Appropriate technologies
 must have the following basic characteristics: easily affordable,
effective, culturally acceptable, and accessible to those who need
them.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThis announcement calls for applications to develop
 devices and other technologies that address the HHC needs of the
nation, including health disparity populations.&amp;nbsp; Generally,
health disparity populations include racial and ethnic minorities, the
rural and urban poor, and other medically underserved
populations.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tMedical and scientific advances have
introduced new opportunities for the continued improvement of health for
 all Americans. However, in spite of notable technological advancement,
there continues to be an underutilization of HHC and a disproportionate
burden of illness among minority and other health disparity
populations.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tHearing loss (HL) is among the leading
public health concerns.&amp;nbsp; Approximately 17% of American adults,
or 36 million people, report some degree of HL.&amp;nbsp; It is the
third most prevalent chronic health condition facing seniors.&amp;nbsp;
Yet, fewer than 20% of those who require intervention and treatment seek
 help for their condition.&amp;nbsp; Most hearing aid users have lived
with HL for over 10 years and their impairments have progressed to
moderate-to-severe levels before seeking a hearing aid.&amp;nbsp; For
many reasons, the current HHC needs of the vast majority of adults with
HL are not being met.&amp;nbsp; In addition, overcoming persistent
disparities in healthcare access and health outcomes remains a foremost
challenge. To meet this challenge, the NIH is committed to supporting a
wide range of research, aimed at the development of innovative
diagnostics, treatments, and preventative strategies to reduce, and
eventually eliminate, health disparities.\n\n\tNIDCD sponsored a
research working group on Accessible and Affordable Hearing Health Care
for Adults with Mild to Moderate Hearing Loss on August 25 -27,
2009.&amp;nbsp; The purpose of the working group was to develop a
research agenda to increase accessibility and affordability of HHC for
adults with mild to moderate HL, including accessible and low cost
hearing aids.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tSmall businesses are well suited to address
 many of the articulated research needs, and the SBIR (R43\/R44) and
STTR (R41\/R42) grant programs represent a unique opportunity to provide
 assistance to these groups. This FOA is one of several NIDCD research
initiatives created in response to the working group
recommendations.&amp;nbsp; A summary of the working group report with
the accompanying recommendations can be found
at:&amp;nbsp;http:\/\/www.nidcd.nih.gov\/funding\/programs\/09HHC\/summary.htm\n\n\tResearch
 Objectives and Scope\n\n\tThe primary objective of this funding
opportunity is to support the translation of technologies, new or
existing, that can have a significant impact on healthcare access and
health outcomes for individuals with hearing loss, including health
disparity populations.&amp;nbsp; A requisite component of the research
plan is a description of the healthcare requirements and needs of the
population and the existing barriers to adequate healthcare
delivery.&amp;nbsp; Several of these barriers have been identified and
are described below.&amp;nbsp; Applications submitted to this funding
opportunity must have potential to improve HHC by developing and
translating technologies that address one or more of these existing
barriers.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\tPhysical Barriers&amp;mdash;factors such
as proximity to healthcare facilities and transportation may limit
access to healthcare.\n\t\n\t\tInfrastructure Barriers&amp;mdash;rural
hospitals and community health centers may not have the same resources
and expertise of large hospitals, and may not be able to afford advanced
 but costly medical technologies.\n\t\n\t\tEconomic
Barriers&amp;mdash;lack of insurance coverage or financial resources may
 contribute to disparities in healthcare access and
outcomes.\n\t\n\t\tKnowledge Barriers&amp;mdash;health literacy and
language barriers can inhibit healthcare delivery, including the
patient&amp;rsquo;s knowledge of their healthcare
needs.\n\t\n\t\tCultural Barriers&amp;mdash;religious beliefs and social
 customs often deter certain populations from seeking
healthcare.\n\t\n\t\tUser Barriers&amp;mdash;manual dexterity, cognitive
 capacity.\n\n\n\tAppropriate technologies must be effective,
affordable, culturally acceptable, and deliverable in ways that are
likely to provide significant gains in access for a specific health
disparity population. It must provide an improvement over the current
quality of care and overcome one or more of the barriers listed
above.&amp;nbsp; The technology must also be low-cost, so as to be
affordable to the local hospital, community health center, primary care
physician, or individual patient in need.&amp;nbsp; For a medical
technology to be accepted and adopted, the technology development must
be amenable to the population&amp;rsquo;s social customs and cultural
beliefs.&amp;nbsp; To be physically deliverable to those in need, a
technology must be developed within the specifications of the operating
environment of the end-user.\n\n\tAn overarching list of the types of
technology that might achieve the objectives of this initiative
includes, but is not limited to:\n\n\t\n\t\tTelehealth technologies for
remote evaluation and monitoring.\n\t\n\t\tDevices or sensors for
point-of-care assessment or treatment.\n\t\n\t\tDevices for in-home
monitoring.\n\t\n\t\tMobile, portable assessment and therapeutic
systems.\n\t\n\t\tDevices which integrate assessment, diagnosis and
treatment.\n\t\n\t\tDevices that do not require special
training.\n\t\n\t\tDevices that can operate in low-resource
environments.\n\t\n\t\tNon-invasive technologies for assessment,
diagnosis and treatment.\n\t\n\t\tIntegrated, automated systems to
assess or monitor a specific condition.\n\n\n\tSome specific examples
include:\n\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of a HHC kiosk, allowing low cost
hearing testing and hearing aid fitting, for underserved patients or in
underserved geographic areas.&amp;nbsp; Services might include hearing
testing and\/or hearing aid fitting, adjustment, user training, and
diagnostic services.\n\t\n\t\tUse of the internet for hearing testing,
hearing aid fitting and adjustment, patient education and
followup.\n\t\n\t\tThe development of calibration systems for automatic
audiometer.\n\t\n\t\tTelephone and internet screening
systems.\n\t\n\t\tUse of currently available basic technology (e.g.
phone lines, internet, universal remote controls, home audiovisual
equipment, smart phones) to promote patient education, surveillance of
hearing loss, hearing aid maintenance, and patient-clinician
communication.\n\t\n\t\tTechnologies minimizing the need for multiple
patient visits to a practitioner&amp;rsquo;s
office.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of automated eudiometry with potential for
implementation beyond the traditional clinical or research
environment.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of low cost self-fitting hearing aids
that improve accessibility though appropriate use of new or existing
technology, after special consideration of patient needs for limited
dexterity, cosmesis, selection, fitting, and
aftercare.\n\n\n\tApplications may seek to increase access to HHC by
using existing instrumentation, if the proposed intervention will be
provided in a format likely to be significantly more affordable,
culturally acceptable, or readily used by patients.&amp;nbsp; Since the
core challenge of this FOA is delivery of HHC to users that have not
accessed this service in the past, atypical and\/or novel strategies for
 commercialization are encouraged\n",

        "topic_name": "Virtual Reality Technologies for Research and
Education in Obesity and Diabetes",
        "description": "\n\tBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:\n\t\n\n\tThe
public health infrastructure is being overwhelmed by problems related to
 over-eating and under-exercising, and it has become clear that many,
perhaps most, people have difficulty assimilating and implementing
information on optimal diet and physical activity. Furthermore, the
emotional, cognitive, and logistical complexities of diabetes management
 have resulted in a situation where a large fraction of patients are in
sub-optimal glycemic control, leading to poor clinical outcomes and high
 expenses. Even if individuals are willing to adhere to professional and
 public health guidance, it is hard to navigate the emotional demands,
environmental choices and opportunity cost issues that present
themselves at the point of decision. This is the cause of failure for
many approaches seeking to promote positive behavioral changes, which is
 of particular concern for individuals with obesity and
diabetes.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tOnline communities and virtual worlds with
avatars (animated characters representing oneself or others) are
increasingly a component of the everyday social world for many
people.&amp;nbsp; Virtual Reality (VR) technologies might prove useful
in bridging the gap between information (healthy population guidance or
therapeutic lifestyle change guidance for obesity and diabetes) and
sustainable behavior change. VR technology allows users to interact with
 (rather than simply observe) computer-simulated environments, typically
 with adapted flat-screen monitor displays or stereoscopic goggles, but
also sometimes with tactile (&amp;ldquo;haptic&amp;rdquo;) or other
sensory feedbacks including taste and smell.\n\n\tVR applications are
currently in development and use for a number of health- and
medicine-related issues, notably rehabilitation medicine (stroke,
Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease, pain control in burn victims), behavioral
 medicine (phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder, drug addiction,
autism), and surgery (technical training, robotics, remote site
treatment). However, except for small studies in clinical eating
disorders (anorexia, binge eating), there has been almost no development
 of the VR field in relation to common issues of food intake, food
choice and encouragement of physical activity among the broader
population.\n\n\tVR technology could be used to complement motivational
interviewing, assess emotional states of readiness for behavioral
change, and help patients to grapple with their emotional reactions to
food choices. The visual presentations could assist patients in
adjusting their distorted assessments of portion sizes; correcting their
 unrealistic expectations of the rate of weight loss; managing sensory
experiences that occur as a result of behavior change, such as hunger or
 satiety from altered consumption patterns, or delayed muscle soreness
from unaccustomed exercise; and enhancing their sense of self-efficacy
by giving them successful experiences in navigating virtual
environments.\n\n\tVR also might be suitable for addressing adherence
barriers in cardiovascular exercise rehabilitation (particularly for
coronary artery disease, heart failure, and peripheral arterial disease)
 such as perceived exertion, anxiety, and capacity to walk to a
prescribed duration and intensity. Another clinical use of VR might be
in the provision of non-judgmental support for patients with various
medical conditions through virtual coaches, and it might be especially
suitable for housebound or reclusive individuals with social anxieties
or mobility restrictions due to morbid obesity or other medical
conditions. VR could be used in the therapeutic setting as a component
of patient visits, to help guide and select educational materials and
strategies and timelines. It might be an especially suitable modality
for children, adolescents and young adults, who already are becoming
familiar with VR as an entertainment technology.&amp;nbsp; VR could also
 be applicable to individuals with low verbal or numerical literacy who
may be more oriented to pictorial (vs. written or abstract)
information.\n\n\tAn evolving body of evidence indicates that poor sleep
 behaviors and insufficient sleep may be causally linked with disordered
 endocrine and appetite regulation and with risk of metabolic syndrome,
diabetes, hypertension and clinical cardiovascular
disease.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\tVR technology presents new
opportunities to apply recent advances in sleep research in relation to
obesity and diabetes risk by objectively evaluating individual sleep and
 alertness status, delivering personalized guidance on healthy sleep
behaviors, implementing physician-recommended treatments (e.g., positive
 airway pressure devices, light therapy), and assessing treatment
outcomes in terms of changes in sleepiness, psycho-motor vigilance, and
ocular markers of sympathetic tone.&amp;nbsp; Sleep parameters (e.g.,
schedules, phasing, quality and quantity), perceptive and affective
aspects of sleepiness (e.g., cognizance of sleepiness, self-monitoring
of sleep habits), and sleep deprivation consequences (slower reaction
times and impairments in memory, cognition, emotional processing,
judgment, and decision-making) are all amenable to study with
VR.\n\n\tVR has some unique characteristics as a research tool. The
virtual environments can be designed to address specific hypotheses, and
 data on the study participant&amp;rsquo;s response to the intervention
can be collected in high detail without additional intrusiveness.
Phenomena that are amenable to study, and also treatment, include cue
responsiveness and extinction through virtual exposure, a feature that
has been used to advantage in treatment of phobias and addictions.
Visual presentations can be tailored to the user, along with therapeutic
 guidance to modify affective reactions and choices, and can prepare the
 user for future &amp;ldquo;real-world&amp;rdquo; encounters, thus
making VR suitable for role-playing and training. Performance feedback,
an essential component of learning and skill acquisition, can occur in
real-time; thus VR can be used as a teaching tool and also to study
cognitive processing of information presented in increasingly complex
(&amp;lsquo;hierarchical&amp;rdquo;) environments, a research approach
that often is not practical in &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo;
settings. Also, the capability to distribute identical virtual
environments across multiple locations gives new meaning to the concept
of multi-site data collection.\n\n\tFor researchers, an advantage is
that the VR approach can simultaneously deliver an intervention and
collect data on how it is utilized, particularly with regard to the
cognitive and emotional processes involved.&amp;nbsp; Study design and
methodology challenges include: identification of appropriate control
groups and control conditions, and of characteristics of rigorous
efficacy and effectiveness studies of VR;&amp;nbsp; exploration of
ethical issues with different types of studies such as direct comparison
 designs (Standard of Care (SOC) vs. VR) and additive designs (SOC vs.
SOC+VR); characterization of how participant traits (such as age,
literacy and numeracy level, motivation and other cognitive and
psychosocial traits), and previous gaming experience moderate technology
 usability and study outcomes; development of well-defined metrics for
assessment of interventions and outcomes, including actual as well as
intended VR &amp;ldquo;dose&amp;rdquo;; development of&amp;nbsp; VR
research tools that could be used in group or multi-site formats (e.g.
classrooms); and development of methods for mining data from existing
health games for research purposes.\n\n\tSELECTED RESEARCH
EXAMPLES:\n\t\n\n\tThere is a need for both developmental VR research
leading to new methods and technologies and marketable commercial
products.&amp;nbsp; There is also the need for research that provides a
venue for well-powered effectiveness trials of the new
interventions.&amp;nbsp;Progress in the field will be enhanced by
multidisciplinary collaborations between the technology industry and
academia, and among researchers with diverse expertise in biomedical
sciences (such as endocrinology, nutrition, and exercise physiology),
behavioral science and pedagogical disciplines, and computer sciences
including VR technologies.&amp;nbsp; There is a need to document and
evaluate currently available off-the-shelf programs.&amp;nbsp; Projects
will need to be clearly defined with regard to:&amp;nbsp; research
questions, technical approach, VR platforms, target population (by age,
health condition, psychological status, education or literacy level,
etc), and research outcomes. Many projects can be usefully conducted
taking advantage of already existing tools, games, and software,
although there is also a need to develop unique
technologies.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\tApplications must involve development,
use or adaptation of immersive or non-immersive VR
environments.&amp;nbsp; Those projects focusing only on electronic means
 of research data collection (so-called &amp;ldquo;e-tools&amp;rdquo;),
without VR components, will not be considered responsive.\n\n\tPotential

Education in Obesity and Diabetes",
        "description": "\n\tBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:\n\t\n\n\tThe
public health infrastructure is being overwhelmed by problems related to
 over-eating and under-exercising, and it has become clear that many,
perhaps most, people have difficulty assimilating and implementing
information on optimal diet and physical activity. Furthermore, the
emotional, cognitive, and logistical complexities of diabetes management
 have resulted in a situation where a large fraction of patients are in
sub-optimal glycemic control, leading to poor clinical outcomes and high
 expenses. Even if individuals are willing to adhere to professional and
 public health guidance, it is hard to navigate the emotional demands,
environmental choices and opportunity cost issues that present
themselves at the point of decision. This is the cause of failure for
many approaches seeking to promote positive behavioral changes, which is
 of particular concern for individuals with obesity and
diabetes.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tOnline communities and virtual worlds with
avatars (animated characters representing oneself or others) are
increasingly a component of the everyday social world for many
people.&amp;nbsp; Virtual Reality (VR) technologies might prove useful
in bridging the gap between information (healthy population guidance or
therapeutic lifestyle change guidance for obesity and diabetes) and
sustainable behavior change. VR technology allows users to interact with
 (rather than simply observe) computer-simulated environments, typically
 with adapted flat-screen monitor displays or stereoscopic goggles, but
also sometimes with tactile (&amp;ldquo;haptic&amp;rdquo;) or other
sensory feedbacks including taste and smell.\n\n\tVR applications are
currently in development and use for a number of health- and
medicine-related issues, notably rehabilitation medicine (stroke,
Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease, pain control in burn victims), behavioral
 medicine (phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder, drug addiction,
autism), and surgery (technical training, robotics, remote site
treatment). However, except for small studies in clinical eating
disorders (anorexia, binge eating), there has been almost no development
 of the VR field in relation to common issues of food intake, food
choice and encouragement of physical activity among the broader
population.\n\n\tVR technology could be used to complement motivational
interviewing, assess emotional states of readiness for behavioral
change, and help patients to grapple with their emotional reactions to
food choices. The visual presentations could assist patients in
adjusting their distorted assessments of portion sizes; correcting their
 unrealistic expectations of the rate of weight loss; managing sensory
experiences that occur as a result of behavior change, such as hunger or
 satiety from altered consumption patterns, or delayed muscle soreness
from unaccustomed exercise; and enhancing their sense of self-efficacy
by giving them successful experiences in navigating virtual
environments.\n\n\tVR also might be suitable for addressing adherence
barriers in cardiovascular exercise rehabilitation (particularly for
coronary artery disease, heart failure, and peripheral arterial disease)
 such as perceived exertion, anxiety, and capacity to walk to a
prescribed duration and intensity. Another clinical use of VR might be
in the provision of non-judgmental support for patients with various
medical conditions through virtual coaches, and it might be especially
suitable for housebound or reclusive individuals with social anxieties
or mobility restrictions due to morbid obesity or other medical
conditions. VR could be used in the therapeutic setting as a component
of patient visits, to help guide and select educational materials and
strategies and timelines. It might be an especially suitable modality
for children, adolescents and young adults, who already are becoming
familiar with VR as an entertainment technology.&amp;nbsp; VR could also
 be applicable to individuals with low verbal or numerical literacy who
may be more oriented to pictorial (vs. written or abstract)
information.\n\n\tAn evolving body of evidence indicates that poor sleep
 behaviors and insufficient sleep may be causally linked with disordered
 endocrine and appetite regulation and with risk of metabolic syndrome,
diabetes, hypertension and clinical cardiovascular
disease.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\tVR technology presents new
opportunities to apply recent advances in sleep research in relation to
obesity and diabetes risk by objectively evaluating individual sleep and
 alertness status, delivering personalized guidance on healthy sleep
behaviors, implementing physician-recommended treatments (e.g., positive
 airway pressure devices, light therapy), and assessing treatment
outcomes in terms of changes in sleepiness, psycho-motor vigilance, and
ocular markers of sympathetic tone.&amp;nbsp; Sleep parameters (e.g.,
schedules, phasing, quality and quantity), perceptive and affective
aspects of sleepiness (e.g., cognizance of sleepiness, self-monitoring
of sleep habits), and sleep deprivation consequences (slower reaction
times and impairments in memory, cognition, emotional processing,
judgment, and decision-making) are all amenable to study with
VR.\n\n\tVR has some unique characteristics as a research tool. The
virtual environments can be designed to address specific hypotheses, and
 data on the study participant&amp;rsquo;s response to the intervention
can be collected in high detail without additional intrusiveness.
Phenomena that are amenable to study, and also treatment, include cue
responsiveness and extinction through virtual exposure, a feature that
has been used to advantage in treatment of phobias and addictions.
Visual presentations can be tailored to the user, along with therapeutic
 guidance to modify affective reactions and choices, and can prepare the
 user for future &amp;ldquo;real-world&amp;rdquo; encounters, thus
making VR suitable for role-playing and training. Performance feedback,
an essential component of learning and skill acquisition, can occur in
real-time; thus VR can be used as a teaching tool and also to study
cognitive processing of information presented in increasingly complex
(&amp;lsquo;hierarchical&amp;rdquo;) environments, a research approach
that often is not practical in &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo;
settings. Also, the capability to distribute identical virtual
environments across multiple locations gives new meaning to the concept
of multi-site data collection.\n\n\tFor researchers, an advantage is
that the VR approach can simultaneously deliver an intervention and
collect data on how it is utilized, particularly with regard to the
cognitive and emotional processes involved.&amp;nbsp; Study design and
methodology challenges include: identification of appropriate control
groups and control conditions, and of characteristics of rigorous
efficacy and effectiveness studies of VR;&amp;nbsp; exploration of
ethical issues with different types of studies such as direct comparison
 designs (Standard of Care (SOC) vs. VR) and additive designs (SOC vs.
SOC+VR); characterization of how participant traits (such as age,
literacy and numeracy level, motivation and other cognitive and
psychosocial traits), and previous gaming experience moderate technology
 usability and study outcomes; development of well-defined metrics for
assessment of interventions and outcomes, including actual as well as
intended VR &amp;ldquo;dose&amp;rdquo;; development of&amp;nbsp; VR
research tools that could be used in group or multi-site formats (e.g.

Arresting Gear Components",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a dynamic bearing material
(aka"slipper") to replace the current material used in the various
subsystems of the carrier based arresting gear system that has improved
service life with emphasis on galling and embedding resistance over the
current material.    DESCRIPTION: Carrier aviation is dependent on the
ability to recover aircraft expeditiously and safely aboard ship.  The
system that arrests the aircraft, the Arresting Gear system, utilizes
slippers or bearing materials between moving components.  The current
slippers material conforms to specification MIL-P-5431 or commercial
product Spaulding T-768.  This material is a cotton-fabric reinforced
graphite phenolic-based composite material.  It is currently sole source
 procurement, and swells when exposed to ethylene glycol, which causes
clearance issues in the operating equipment.  When this material is used
 as packing, galling of material results in unwanted leakage,
necessitating replacement prior to scheduled maintenance.  Maintenance
involving replacement of the slippers is a labor intensive, expensive
process.      The Navy is seeking a material for the slippers that is
more wear resistant than the current material.  Improving the life of
the slippers will result in labor savings and greater equipment
availability.        The slipper materials bear the weight of the
various arresting gear components:  main engine cylinder piston,
crosshead, accumulator piston, and sheave damper piston.  The slippers
are the sliding medium between arresting gear components to allow free
movement during arrestments, therefore the static and dynamic frictional
 characteristics of the slippers are significant.  The slippers bear the
 weight of the components both statically and dynamically during
arrestments.  Static loading on slippers varies from 10 psi to 530 psi.
The dynamic loading has not been resolved.  The slippers are subject to
immersion in ethylene-glycol based hydraulic fluid, humid air, and
various greases and lubricants.  The slippers must maintain dimensional
stability throughout their lifetime, and have low wear rates compared to
 the existing material.  System operating temperature is ambient to 200
degrees F.  Acceleration of components varies from 0 to 18 G"s during an
 arrestment.  Total linear movement of the slippers during an arrestment
 is from 0 in. to 112 in.  Velocity of the slippers during an arrestment
 ranges from 0 in\/s to a peak of 540 in\/s.  It is desired for the
slippers to have a life of 20,000 arrestments, with no shelf life
limitations. The slippers are presently machined to shape, and some are
required to be custom fitted and machined in situ during replacement.
It is desired, but not required, for the same material to be used in all
 applications.    The Navy will consider proposals for new materials,
application of existing materials, or novel approaches to slipper
materials, but the solution must be a drop-in replacement for the
current material.  No proposals that require arresting gear component
re-design will be considered.      PHASE I: Develop a concept for an
improved"slipper"material including an approach for manufacturing
the"slipper"material.  Demonstrate feasibility of the approach through
limited testing.    PHASE II: Fully develop the concept conceived under
Phase I into a prototype"slipper"material for use in the various
arresting gear system applications.   Demonstrate the ability of the
system to provide the required life under operational conditions along
with the ability to produce the material in a repeatable fashion.
PHASE III: Perform qualification testing and transition
the"slipper"material to the fleet.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL

system that allows for Time\/Angle of Arrival analysis, testing,

sensors on fixed wing (manned and unmanned) and rotary wing aircraft.
 DESCRIPTION: ASW systems and sensors under development require
increasing test and evaluation prior to production decision to ensure
the adequacy and effectiveness of the technology.  Sensors such as
Software Defined Sonobouy Receiver (SDSR) process acoustics signals
received from sonobuoys, based on Time\/Angle of Arrival (T\/AoA),
require a dispersal pattern for the signals to test the range and
accuracy of the system processor hardware and software.  Current test
environments only allow for acoustic signals radiated from a single
source (antenna) which are not geographically dispersed. T\/AoA cannot
be calculated properly without geographical separation of antennas.  An
innovative approach is needed to provide multiple acoustic signal time
and angle of arrival to simulate a real time ASW environment for the
test, validation, and verification of the SDSR.  In addition, up to 64
acoustic signals will need to be generated from the acoustic array
simulator to ensure the fidelity of the processing hardware and software
 systems and sensors.  Also, an innovative process to convert the
acoustic signal for ground testing application and environmental
simulation must also be part of the proposed solution.    PHASE I:
Determine the feasibility and recommend an approach for developing an
innovative, low cost, acoustic array simulation system that provides for
 end to end test and system effectiveness modeling of T\/AoA in an ASW

acoustic signal conversion for ground testing and sensor simulations.
Investigate the potential for the use of reusable sonobuoys as part of
the acoustic array simulation system.    PHASE II: Develop a prototype
design of the acoustic array simulation system and determine all
technical challenges and risks with the implementation of the proposed
design in a real time environment.  Demonstrate the feasibility of
leveraging new technologies into the prototype system design.
Demonstrate the generation of up to 64 acoustic signals in the test

 the real time tracking of the narcotic traffickers at sea.  A GPS

thermally resistant portable vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) pad
system for Marine Expeditionary Airfields.    DESCRIPTION:  In austere
environments, brownout conditions can be a problem to rotary wing
aircraft and its personnel.  A brownout condition is an in-flight
visibility restriction due to dust or sand in the air.  in a brownout,
the pilot cannot see nearby objects which provide the outside visual
references necessary to control the aircraft near the ground.  This can
cause spatial disorientation and loss of situational awareness leading
to a deadly mishap.    To combat these types of situations, the USMC
installs a lightweight mat vtol pad, such as mobimat, for landing and
takeoff.  Lightweight mat serves as a dust suppressing material.  As
rotor wash passes through the semi-permeable mat systems, the dirt,
dust, and sand are kept down and prevent the brownout effects.
Mobimat fails when subjected to the increased downward thermal loads
expected from future helicopters\/vertical landing aircraft.  The Navy
needs research and development of a new lightweight mat with material
that is lightweight, strong, and highly heat resistant for compatibility
 with future aircraft.    General requirements:  1.   shall be able to
withstand 650 degrees fahrenheit minimum for 20 minutes minimum.   2.

 different landing and takeoff procedures. A successful demonstration
will also exhibit fast setup and installation.    PHASE III: The

System Capable of Detecting, Localizing, and Characterizing Damage in
Composite Aircraft Structures",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative structural
health monitoring (SHM) system capable of detecting damage in composite
aircraft structures. The system must be able to successfully detect
damage events, localize where the damage occurred, and characterize the
type of damage in critical components of the aircraft structure that if
left undetected might lead to loss of the aircraft and crew.
DESCRIPTION: Advanced composite materials are becoming more commonly
used in modern aircraft structural components to reduce the overall
weight, fuel expenditures and life cycle cost of the aircraft.  Despite
their high strength and flexibility in design, composite materials are
susceptible to damage.  The main sources of damage are fatigue and
direct impact, causing cracking, crushing, or delamination of the
composite material. The ability to detect anomalies or damage in
composite aircraft structures could significantly reduce the amount of
inspection and testing required, resulting in greater aircraft
availability and higher readiness rates.     The aim of this program is
to develop a structural health monitoring system capable of detecting,
locating, and characterizing damage in composite aircraft structural
components. The SHM system should have a math\/physics based model that
is the basis for characterizing damage and be capable of characterizing
as many types of damage as possible.    A potential system's sensors
must be capable of operating in typically harsh aviation environments
including wide temperature and humidity variation as well as high
vibration. Proposed systems must minimize the number of sensors used
while maintaining the ability to monitor globally and detect damage
locally. Ideal systems will utilize wireless sensors and technology.
PHASE I: Develop a SHM system concept that detects, localizes, and
characterizes damage on composite aircraft structures.  Demonstrate
damage detection, localization, and characterization capability on a
composite aircraft structure.    PHASE II: Develop a prototype SHM
system capable of deployment for damage detection on an actual aircraft

thermal gradients, etc.).    PHASE III: Integrate developed SHM system
with end user systems and interfaces.  Conduct final experimental
testing on actual NAVAIR assets.  Transition damage detection of

mitigation.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE
APPLICATIONS: A number of other applications and industries would
benefit from a composite SHM system.  The system could potentially
benefit any Navy application where composite structures are subjected to
 harsh environments where the risk of damage is high.  Commercial
aviation could also benefit from a successfully developed composite SHM

Refurbishment of Infrared Search and Track (IRST) Germanium (Ge) Domes",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a process to refurbish
hemispherical Ge domes, which will restore infrared (IR) transmission
and meet the operational performance specifications of the IRST system.
   DESCRIPTION:  After extensive use in adverse environments such as
sandstorms, rain, and fog, IR domes develop pits and surface anomalies,
which lead to a reduction in the average transmission to below
acceptable limit. New domes are quite costly since they are constructed
of single-crystal germanium (Ge) with very sophisticated inner and outer
 surface coatings.  A process is needed that is capable of restoring the
 ge domes to a state or condition that will pass all imaging and
environmental specifications set for the original dome design.  The
refurbishment process must take into consideration the tight tolerances
on inner and outer radii to maintain focal length and eliminate any
image distortion. A refurbishment process that results in a change in
dome thickness, and therefore focal length, should be detailed.  A
process to rebuild the ge dome to its original thickness should be
included in the contractor's report.  The IRST system operates in the
nominal 7.5-13 um region.  Ge is a wide-band gap semiconductor with a
refractive index of n=4.00 (10 um) and is naturally 54 percent
transparent to IR light in the wavelength range of 2-14 um.  No IR
energy is lost in the material but a reduction of 56 percent
transmission occurs due to reflections at the front and back surfaces of
 a highly polished ge window.  Antireflective (AR) coatings deposited
onto these surfaces can help to virtually eliminate surface reflections
and increase IR transmission to greater than 95 percent over specific
wavelength ranges.  The contractor must include recommendations for the
alternative AR coating materials and rain and sand erosion protection
will both maximize IR transmission in the designated IR wavelength band
and provide durability to withstand the operational environment.
PHASE I: Develop a process for refurbishing Ge Domes. Research existing
processes and provide a conceptual analysis of the proposed process.
Provide pertinent calculations, which demonstrate the knowledge required
 to design, develop and produce a process to re-polish and recoat
existing IRST Ge domes that have not passed the transmission test.
Provide an estimate of the cost benefit of refurbishment compared to
dome replacement.    PHASE II: Produce and verify a process that will
refurbish the Ge domes to an operationally ready state. Refine a process
 to rebuild the domes to their original thickness while maintaining the
required performance specifications of the IRST system.  A test case
should be generated to validate the rebuild\/refurbish process developed
 by the contractor.    PHASE III: Restore IRST domes to the original
specifications required by the IRST system.  The restoration shall, at a
 minimum, make ready for issue (RFI) all domes that have previously been
 removed from the inventory.  Domes that cannot be restored should be
evaluated for further reconditioning or recommended for condemnation.
 PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: The
electric power utility industry utilizes IR sensors in the same
bandwidth as the IRST sensor to perform evaluation on above ground power
 transmission lines for insulation leaks. These power line insulator
leaks result in power transmission loss costing the electric utility
companies millions of dollars annually. To identify failures in power
line insulation, public utilities use specially configured aircraft that
 fly over the nation's power lines using an IR sensor to detect the
leaks. The IR systems used in the utility company's aircraft generally
have the same type of IR window used in an IRST system. While less harsh
 (lower speed), the utility company aircraft's IR system is subject to
much of the same environment. However, the utility companies operate
their aircraft IR systems more than the Navy uses the IRST. Further, the
 flights are made at lower altitudes where airborne particulate matter
has a greater opaquing effect on the IR window. As a result, failure of
the IR window occurs as often if not more often than in the Navy.
Development of a refurbishment process can be directly applied to this
particular commercial application. The same applies to the oil and gas
industry in the identification of leaks in their pipelines.",

with Excellent Beam Quality",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To significantly improve the overall
efficiency of 808 nm, kilowatt class laser pump diode arrays through 1)
electrical to optical efficiency improvement and 2) combined beam
quality improvements to most effectively use the optical energy in the
pumped, lasing medium.    DESCRIPTION: Today's commercially available
kilowatt class, 808 nanometer (nm) laser diode arrays and stacks are
approaching 60% electrical to optical conversion efficiency.  However,
due to the low combined beam quality, high temperature coefficient and
line width, the generated optical pump poser cannot be used efficiently.
  The DARPA Super-High-Efficiency Diode Sources (SHEDS) program made
great strides in the last decade, particularly in the 975 nm range.  At
that time though, the 808 nm efficiency was advanced to approximately
45%.  To reduce the size, weight and power draw of current, near-term,
and future Navy laser sensors, particularly Nd:YAG based laser
transmitters, further improvements in 808 nm diode array efficiencies,
approaching or exceeding 85%, must be made.    This SBIR topic focuses
on several aspects of high power laser diode efficiency.  The first is
electrical to optical conversion efficiency, sometimes called wall plug
efficiency.  This high efficiency goal includes cooling of the laser
diode array.  If cryogenic techniques are used, this requires additional
 electrical power.  Therefore room temperature operation with standard
water or convection cooling techniques are desired.  The next aspect is
combined beam quality.  While Gaussian beams with M2 (a popular measure
of beam quality) values of 1 with low beam divergence are desired, it is
 difficult to achieve.  However, the beam quality is very important for
maximizing the optical power density and uniformity in the laser media
pumped volume.  This might be considered optical to optical efficiency
where the maximum laser diode pump power is converted to the end product
 laser power, 1064 nm power in the Nd:YAG case.  A third aspect that
contributes to efficacy is the stability and line width of the laser
diode array.  The pumped laser media tends to have peaked absorption
spectra so a low temperature coefficient and a narrow line width output
of the laser pump diode array will contribute to the optical power
conversion efficiency in the overall laser system.    In summary, Key
performance objectives that are to be optimized are: 1) maximizing diode
 array, efficiency for kilo-watt class stacks, 2) maximizing beam
combining efficiency and beam quality and 3) minimizing the temperature
coefficient and laser line width.    PHASE I: Demonstrate the
feasibility of the technical approach.  Perform preliminary bench-top
testing to verify performance of components or design.    PHASE II:
Develop and demonstrate a working bench-top design.  Sufficiently harden
 bench-top design for testing and demonstration in dynamic environment.
 Design and develop working proto-type based on results of bench-top
device.    PHASE III: Complete prototype development and document the
design. Units procured under this phase may be tested\/demonstrated in
Navy systems.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE
APPLICATIONS: In the laboratory environment efficiency is not required,
however, the cost per KiloWatt will be reduced and therefore highly
desirable in a wide range of commercial laser systems.",

        "topic_name": "Deep Vector Sensor System",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Determine the feasibility of
developing a Reliable Acoustic Path Vector Sensor Sonobuoy System
DESCRIPTION: The Navy is becoming increasingly interested in the
prospect of deploying acoustic sensing systems below critical depth in
the ocean at extremely deep depths close to or on the ocean bottom in
convergent zone type environments [1].  At these depths the ambient
noise structure and sound propagation physics are unique [2] and have
the potential to be exploited by future surveillance systems.  The
concept of reliable acoustic path sensing within the sonobuoy community
is not new since a sonobuoy known as the reliable acoustic path sonobuoy
 was developed in the 1980s, but never went into production [3].  That
buoy employed monostatic sonar system architecture and had an
operational frequency of approximately 4 kHz.  Recent investigation of
the ambient noise structure in the deep ocean [2] suggests that a
passive directional sonobuoy system covering the band from 5 to 500 Hz
would be of interest.  When the sea state is calm, the ambient levels
are nominally 40 to 50 dB re 1 1\/4Pa2\/Hz [2].  A directional sonobuoy
comprised of a single triaxial vector sensor having an electronic noise
floor that is 15 to 20 dB below the ambient (25db re 1 1\/4Pa2\/Hz goal)
 is thought to be well-suited for this application particularly in view
of the array gains achievable as a result of the anisotropic noise
field.  The low electronic noise specification puts extreme demands on
the sensor given the A-size sonobuoy form factor coupled with operation
at 6 km depths [4].  Another major challenge concerns the use of a
hard-wire telemetry link to route the data from the sensor to a surface
buoy which in turn has an RF link.  The term hard-wire is meant in the
general sense of having a physical connection from the sensor to the
surface buoy.  Given this physical connection, special consideration
must be made concerning how the system is packaged, deployed, and
mitigates self-noise.  In addition to the difficult requirements for the
 triaxial sensor, innovative sonobuoy engineering concepts are needed to
 achieve this goal.      The lessons learned regarding mitigation of
vertical motion and flow-induced noise on the AN\/SSQ-53 DIFAR sonobuoy
[3] should be folded into the design, as appropriate.  RF link
considered shall be the new proposed sonobuoy link which is composed
CPGFSK (Continuous Phase Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying) waveform of
320 kbps of which 288 kbps can be acoustic data.    Note that A-size
refers to the standard U.S. Navy Sonobuoy form factor or a
right-circular cylinder having a diameter, length, and maximum weight of
 D=4.875 inches, L=36 inches, and W=39 pounds.    PHASE I: Perform
modeling and simulation studies to evaluate prospective sensor,
telemetry, packaging, deployment, and self-noise remediation designs
within the overall architecture of an A-size sonobuoy    PHASE II:
Fabricate and test a pre-prototype sonobuoy for an over-the-side test in
 a convergence zone type area location    PHASE III: Develop a
production design of the Phase II solution. Demonstrate full operational
 functionality in Navy-supported test scenarios. Transition the

 density, high efficiency power conversion and conditioning device for
high power, low duty cycle, rotary wing aircraft-based applications.
Proposals shall demonstrate the ability to receive input voltages that
shall consist of standard military aircraft ac and dc voltages; to
include 115 volt ac (vac), 400 hz, 3-phase; 28 volt dc (vdc); and\/or
270 vdc sourced from an aircraft power generation system, unregulated
aircraft-qualified transformer rectifier, battery, and\/or capacitor
module.     The technology solution shall provide a high vdc output
(estimated between 270 and 500 vdc), at an estimated power level of 100
to 150 kwe for a minimum duration of 30 seconds. the estimated duty
cycle shall vary between 10 to 25% over a period of one-hour, but will
be assessed dependent on the technology solution(s) provided within the
proposal.  Voltage tolerances of +\/- 1 to 5% during the duty cycle,
independent of the change in input voltage when utilizing battery or
capacitor technologies, shall be required.  The technology solution
shall be designed to minimize output voltage ripple amplitude throughout
 operation, with a maximum allowance of 6.0 volts.  The technology
solution may include a dedicated thermal management system (tms) to
support operation, or can include requirements for interface to
existing\/planned aircraft tms.      The ability for the technology
solution to be scalable and support paralleled operation to allow for
increased system level power (&gt;150 kwe) is valid and of significant
interest under this topic.  The use of multiple lower power level
technology solutions in parallel to support the stated power level goal
of 100 to 150 kwe may also be valid, provided benefits of doing so are
clearly shown.     Proposals shall focus on the innovative use of
technologies that support dc to dc and\/or ac to dc conversion; which
may include wide temperature power electronics\/components, optimized
thermal management design methodologies, and\/or advanced material use;
to ensure the technology solution is within reasonable size, weight, and
 power (swap) for use onboard a rotary wing platform.  Additional system
 level design requirements shall be provided to support the selected
design approach during a Phase I requirements review.    Technical
challenges include, but are not limited to, 1) producing components of
sufficient reliability under estimated high power conditions, 2)
producing components of sufficient power densities for aviation
applications, 3) producing components that can withstand high operating
temperatures and 4) developing components that can withstand the harsh
navy aircraft operational, electrical, and environmental requirements
(e.g. temperature, altitude, shock, vibration, emi).    PHASE I: Define a
 technical approach and implementation plan for developing an aircraft
electrical power conversion and conditioning technology for high power,
short duty cycle applications. Validate the approach analytically or
provide test data or bench top hardware that would validate the

 power conversion and conditioning technology for high power, short duty
 cycle applications for use in a Navy aircraft platform, complete safety
 of flight certification, and perform a flight demonstration. Transition

evaluations, and procurement.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL
POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: The results of this work can be
commercialized to provide high density, high efficiency aircraft
electrical power conversion and conditioning technology for space, sea,
air, and land vehicles. This technology will result in improved safety
and reliability, reduced maintenance costs, and reduced procurement
costs by extending the service life of the equipment. Private sectors
that face similar reliability concerns include aerospace, power
utilities, and automotive industries. Commercial airlines are

        "topic_name": "GPS-Iridium Anti-Jam (AJ) Antenna Systems for Air
 Vehicle and Sea Vehicle Platforms",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop integrated military anti-jam
(AJ) antenna systems with small footprint which can operate using both
GPS navigation satellite signals and Iridium communication satellite
signals. Antennas are desired for both air vehicle and sea vehicle
platforms. An integrated antenna system offers the following potential
benefits compared to the use of two separate antenna systems: reduced
antenna footprint more suitable for platforms with limited size, weight
and power (SWAP) constraints, reduced integration and test costs,
reduced complexity of upgrade (e.g. an existing GPS antenna may be
replaced with a GPS-Iridium antenna), integrated antenna provides AJ
benefits to both types of systems, common antenna aperture for
navigation and timing, e.g. facilitates compensation of Doppler effects
associated with antenna lever arms and enables enhanced signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR).    DESCRIPTION:  Signals broadcast by GPS satellites are
susceptible to degradation or disruption by low levels of RF
interference.  One method to counter GPS interference is through the use
 of multi-element adaptive array antenna technology to either form an
antenna beam null in the direction of interference sources, form beams
in the direction of GPS satellites or perform a combination of these two
 operations.  Current GPS antenna systems operate on the military L1 and
 L2 frequency bands.    The inclusion of iridium signal functionality
within a common adaptive array antenna system introduces significant
challenges into the antenna design requirements.     GPS AJ antenna
systems must operate in the presence of multiple GPS satellites in view,
 e.g. up to 12 satellites, and also multiple GPS interferers in view
having different line-of-sight (los) directions. Whereas older antenna
technologies often operated on the principle of"nulling"the interferer
signal, e.g. by forming nulls in the antenna gain pattern in the
direction of the interferers, many of the newer antenna systems combine
nulling with beam forming or beam steering, i.e. forming antenna beams
in the direction to GPS satellites.  The combination of nulling towards
interferers and beam forming towards GPS satellites has the effect of
attenuating the interference signals while amplifying the satellite
signals. even when interference is not present, the effects of beam
forming can provide increased SNR and link margin for processing GPS and
 iridium signals.    The process of"nulling"can result in rapidly
changing composite RF signal phases (often in an unpredictable fashion)
in the GPS receiver and navigation algorithm. since some gps
applications, e.g. aircraft landing systems, require the use of precise
carrier phase information, the navigation function associated with these
 applications can be degraded when nulling occurs.  If the complex
antenna weights are controlled (or known) in the same processor as the
navigation function, then the effect of the complex weights on the
composite RF signal phase can be predicted.  More advanced algorithms
can combine adaptive antenna array and adaptive filter technologies in
the time or frequency domains to perform space-time adaptive processing
(STAP) or space frequency adaptive processing (SFAP).    On some air
vehicle and sea vehicle platforms the functions of beam forming and
nulling must also compensate for aircraft kinematics, e.g. rotation of
the antenna array plane.  Thus modern adaptive antenna system signal
processing may be tightly coupled with GPS and inertial navigation
systems (INS) for improved performance.    Designs which digitally form
the antenna array beams within the receiver\/navigation processor may
also generate a different beam for each satellite signal processed, with
 the processing of each type of signal optimized for frequency band,
signal power, signal and interference characteristics within the
frequency band of interest, and signal type requirement (e.g. navigation
 or communication), etc.    Solutions for both air vehicle and sea
vehicle platforms are desired, including small form factors with
diameters of four inches or less and depth of three inches or less
(including antenna and antenna electronics).  Both iridium signal
transmission and reception functions are required.  For air vehicles, AJ
 capability is desired for both the received GPS and iridium signals.
For the sea vehicle version, AJ is required for the GPS signal reception
 and the GPS reception and iridium transmit\/receive capability does not
 have to be simultaneous.  Objectives include frequency bandwidth
compatible with the GPS m-code (L1&amp;L2 with at least 24 mhz
bandwidth) and a 30 db interference rejection capability for at least
three los directions while maintaining good signal availability for
accuracy.    Some of the technical challenges associated with an
integrated GPS-iridium AJ array antenna system include: (1) the antenna
system must address platform constraints and interface requirements for
both gps and iridium signals, and must operate synergistically with GPS
and iridium transceiver signal processing, (2) interoperability with
other platform blue force rf emissions, (3) received iridium signal can
be significantly stronger than received GPS signals, (4) the antenna
must also support transmissions from the platform to the iridium
satellites and the transmission signal is much stronger than the
received signals -- thus the antenna system must provide good isolation
to prevent the transmission signal from activating the nulling function,
 and to enable simultaneous reception of weak navigation and
communication signals and transmission of strong signals, if applicable
for platform mission requirements, (5) iridium is a LEO system and GPS
is a MEO system so that the iridium satellites are subject to much
smaller rise to setting time intervals, e.g. on the order of several
minutes for iridium as compared to several hours for GPS satellites, and
 higher doppler and doppler rates for iridium than for GPS satellites,
(6) iridium satellites do not have as much geometric diversity as the
GPS satellites, e.g. whereas often eight or more GPS satellites are in
typically in view, only four satellites are needed to enable a
navigation solution.  On the other hand, often only a single iridium
satellite is in view and this satellite must maintain connectivity for
the duration of the communications interval or until another satellite
comes into view.  Thus for a single iridium satellite in view, the los
direction must be given a strong preference within the spatial
processing algorithm.  The beam forming may need to be coordinated with
the iridium satellite communications function, including a coordinated
switching to new iridium satellites at the appropriate time epochs.
PHASE I: Perform analyses and trades to illustrate a strong
understanding of the requirements and to predict performance.  Develop
designs for integrated GPS-Iridium antenna systems or
antenna\/transceiver navigation\/communication systems that address the
technical issues and challenges indicated above.  Demonstrate how the
antenna system integrates into air and sea vehicle platforms and
operates synergistically with the GPS-Iridium and INS, if applicable,
signal processing. The design should emphasize reuse of existing antenna
 technology and consideration of platform requirements and constraints,
including interface and availability requirements.  Document the design
and predicted performance results in a report.    For the sea vehicle
version, a Phase I objective includes demonstration via breadboard or
test bed.    PHASE II: Develop the design into a mature bread board,
test bed or prototype system, and demonstrate performance in an RF
interference environment using simulated or real GPS and Iridium
satellite signals.    PHASE III: Develop operational GPS-Iridium
integrated antenna systems or antenna\/transceiver
navigation\/communication system, integrate and test the performance in
air vehicle and sea vehicle platforms in the presence of interference.
  PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: This
technology may also be used for navigation on commercial air and sea
vehicle systems, e.g. commercial aircraft. For example, because of the
proliferation of low-cost GPS jammers, the FAA is becoming more
concerned about the loss of GPS or Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)
signals due to RF interference, such as recently occurred in the Newark
airport area. In this case, the antenna design could be modified to
include the WAAS signal as broadcast from WAAS satellites deployed at
geosynchronous (GEO) orbit.",

Surface Transceivers",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Provide innovative concepts leading
to the development of a Lasercom (Free-space optical (FSO)
communication) system for use in Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW)
Operations.    DESCRIPTION: Lasercom, also known as free-space optical
(FSO) communication, has emerged in recent years as an attractive
alternative to conventional RF communication [1, 2, 3]. This is due to
the increasing maturity of lasers and compact optical systems as well as
 unique advantages of Lasercom. Setup is relatively low-cost, with no
licensing or frequency allocation requirements.     Lasercom's primary
advantages for military applications are covertness, lack of Radio
Frequency Interference (RFI) from any RF sources (radars or
communication systems), immunity to jamming, lack of frequency
allocation requirements (allowing operation in all national and
international waters), and high bandwidth. Lasercom inherently has a low
 probability of interception and detection (LPI\/LPD). The successful
demonstration of FSO links for ASW operations will enable diversified
communication paths that will allow operations in situations where RF
sources are inoperable due to multiple possible causes RF interferences,
 jamming, spectrum allocations issues, lack of host nation approval.
 Lasercom system will consist in the implementation of a bi-directional
free-space point-to-point optical link utilizing invisible beams of
light to send and receive voice, video, and data information between two
 transceivers within line-of-sight transmission. FSO technology is based
 on the connectivity between FSO-based optical wireless units, each
consisting of an optical transceiver to provide full-duplex
(bi-directional) capability. The Lasercom system plan of integration
consists of a low-cost solution, small size factor, low power
consumption, and minimum hardware impact to both transceivers. For this
application, acoustic data will be transmitted to the aircraft platform
using the Lasercom uplink, while commands will be sent to the ocean
surface transceiver via the Lasercom downlink.      Given the
ever-present need for secure communication, the increasing need for
higher bandwidth, and the decreasing available RF spectrum , it seems to
 be the question of when, not if, free-space optical links will be used
for many military applications.     PHASE I: Develop an initial
conceptual design for the full-duplex Free-space Optical Communication
Link.  Perform a design modeling in order to provide a conceptual design
 trade study for the proposed Lasercom Link. Identify small-size factor,
 low-cost and power consumption and minimum hardware impact to the ocean
 surface transceiver solution.    PHASE II: Refine and modify the
Lasercom link design developed in Phase I.  Develop, construct and
demonstrate the operation of the prototype Lasercom link selected in
Phase I.  Perform a laboratory based proof of concept demonstration for
the Lasercom link selected in Phase I.    PHASE III: Optimize the
Lasercom link design based on the test and evaluation results of Phase
II.  Demonstrate full system performance and conduct sea tests in areas
of interest.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE
APPLICATIONS: Free-space optical communication links will provide a
diversified communication path for ASW operations where RF sources are
inoperable due to RFI, jamming and spectrum allocation issues. Lasercom
link will benefit the U.S. DON by providing a secure communication path
between ocean surface transceivers and air platforms transceivers in RF
inoperable areas.",

Swarming and Other Nonlinear, Dispersed Tactics Against Naval Surface
Forces",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop innovative intelligent agents
 for the prediction of swarming and other nonlinear, dispersed tactics
against Naval surface forces utilizing airborne radar and electro-optic
sensor information.    DESCRIPTION: Naval forces conducting transits
through straits and other congested littoral operational areas are
presented with a challenging force protection requirement.  Surface
traffic density is often high, with many ferries, fishing and pleasure
boats, and large cargo ships maneuvering in a small area. Existing rules
 of engagement designate query and warning ranges, but international law
 and freedom of navigation allow vessels to operate in very close
proximity to our combatants. These small vessels are often difficult to
regulate and many lack basic equipment such as bridge to bridge radios.
With a host of stationary and seemingly randomly moving boats,
determining a hostile action in a timely manner is difficult at best.
These conditions make the identification of and defense against hostile
small craft extremely difficult.  Of particular concern when operating
in these areas is countering pre-planned or opportunistic hostile swarm
attacks. A variety of swarm and counter-swarm tactics exist, but the
single most important enabler for success is having superior situational
 awareness.  This is in fact a fundamental advantage that all types of
military forces seek.     At present airborne surveillance radar and
electro-optics are of limited value to the surface combatant as they are
 seen as unable to provide the ship watch standers actionable
information to support the determination of hostile action and\/or
hostile intent. A contact's speed, angle of approach, and location are
not sufficient to determine intent in such high density environments. In
 the absence of additional insight regarding intent, surface combatants
rely on a last minute determination of intent which is based on based
direct visual observation by the ship's watch standers.  However, radar
systems can now provide the ability to observe the behavior of specific
targets over extended periods of time utilizing maritime classification
aids and target fingerprinting. The missing component and the focus of
this topic is the development intelligent agent to predict impending
threats, much as is done with crime forecasting tools, based on a
knowledge of target classification and behaviors of all contacts within
the surveillance field of view. These analysis tools are necessary for
general pattern analysis including the detection of preparations for
swarm encirclement actions.     PHASE I: Investigate technical
approaches that provide determination of, or give indications of,
hostile intent against Naval surface forces operating in congested
littoral operational areas.  Radar and electro-optic maritime
classification aids along with high range resolution radar
fingerprinting and tracking are to be utilized in the technical
approach.  Identify the specific nature of the analysis algorithms and
the human-machine interfaces to be used and develop a detailed
implementation plan.    PHASE II:  Develop a robust intelligent agent
analysis tool for the candidate sensor suite.  Demonstrate non real time
 processing using government-provided data with sufficient fidelity to
enable assessment of operator workload reduction, algorithm tuning, and
sensor utilization.  Demonstrate the functionality, performance, and
correctness of all components.  Prepare an integration plan to complete
the development and transition of the toolset into the candidate sensor
suite.    PHASE III: Transition the intelligent agent to appropriate
platforms and interested commercial entities.    PRIVATE SECTOR

        "topic_name": "Automated Antenna CAD for Installed Performance
Assessment and Optimization",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an antenna design tool that
will produce antenna CAD models and design candidates optimized for use
in CEM on-aircraft antenna analysis.    DESCRIPTION: It is vital to
understand the installed performance of antennas as mounted on a
platform and in the presence of cosited antennas. The two alternatives
for quantifying installed performance are measurement and simulation.
Measurements are costly and often impractical during the design phase of
 antenna\/platform integration. At the same time, computational
electromagnetic (CEM) techniques and codes continue to mature, and CEM
tools are increasingly used to assess installed performance for a known
antenna placement or to optimize the placement for a given mission.
Regardless of the CEM technique employed, one must ultimately acquire or
 develop a functional CAD model of the antenna in order to execute
platform-level CEM simulations.    Many aircraft antennas are
commercial-off-the-self (COTS).  While manufacturers typically provide
limited, top-level performance specifications and physical
characteristics for their antennas (e.g., frequency range, impedance,
VSWR, peak gain, highest sidelobe, principal-plane pattern cuts, power
capacity, polarization, weight, form factor), they seldom make available
 engineering data that enables installed performance CEM simulations
involving their products: the internal geometric and material structure
of the antenna, its feed structure, and associated circuitry. If the
function that the antenna performs is known, this helps to identify the
basic antenna type but not its detailed design and engineering. Even
when the detailed antenna design is known, its structure may be too
complex to develop a workable CEM CAD model within the constraints of
time and budget. If a similar radiation pattern and input impedance can
be achieved with a simpler CEM CAD model, useful installed performance
results can still be obtained.    The above demonstrates the need for a
methodology (and for its implementation in software) that can produce a
physical or CEM CAD model of an antenna given a subset of top-level
performance data, physical characteristics, and functional purpose\/type
 (e.g., radar, GPS, direction finding, electronic steering, etc.). Given
 such inputs, the capability should also produce candidate design types
to assist in the selection of COTS antennas. A well-designed graphical
user interface (GUI) should guide the user through the process of
engaging this capability. If computationally intensive, the software
should run efficiently on CPU and CPU\/GPU clusters. All supporting
modules in the software should either be the intellectual property of
the proposing company or secured through licensing so that the tool can
be commercialized.    PHASE I: Develop and demonstrate a methodology
that uses COTS antenna performance and physical data to yield antenna
designs and their physical descriptions. Develop a set of metrics to
gauge the quality of the design versus spec. Make a list of antennas for
 aircraft and prioritize according to antenna complexity. Consult with
the TPOC regarding interfaces between the Navy's CEM codes and the
proposed tool. Develop a detailed outline of the tool requirements,
including the GUI.    PHASE II: Convert the process developed in Phase I
 into an engineering tool, including computation engine, GUI, and
interfacing to Navy CEM codes. Validate the tool on cases of interest to
 NAVAIR. Make necessary arrangements to commercialize the tool either in
 partnership with another company or alone and seek potential sponsors.
   PHASE III: Refine methodology and tool developed in Phase II either
alone or in partnership with another company. Port the tool to clusters
of CPUs and CPU\/GPUs.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE

        "topic_name": "Carbon Monoxide Detector For Aviation Oxygen
Systems",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a sensor for detecting toxic
contaminants in oxygen produced by aircraft On-Board Oxygen Generating
Systems (OBOGS).    DESCRIPTION: Aircraft equipped with On-Board Oxygen
Generating Systems (OBOGS) provide aircrew breathing oxygen using
molecular sieves and Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) technology. The
OBOGS selectively filters compressed air from the aircraft's engine to
remove nitrogen and other gaseous contaminants to provide the aircrew
with an oxygen enriched breathing gas. During shipboard operations, Navy
 aircraft are particularly vulnerable to excessive levels of toxic
byproducts from ingesting the jet exhaust from other aircraft. Under
suboptimal operating conditions, toxic byproducts can breach the OBOGS
and enter the aircrew's oxygen supply. NAVAIR is developing an oxidizing
 catalyst to eliminate these toxins, but a sensor is needed to determine
 when the catalyst may be losing effectiveness.    The sensor must be
capable of detecting, as a minimum, low level hydrocarbons including
carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and
aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons that are byproducts of incomplete
jet fuel and lubricant combustion. The sensor must be capable of
operating in an oxygen rich environment from 21 to 100% oxygen. Oxygen
system pressures range from 24 PSIA to 100 PSIA. Operating temperature
ranges from -40C to +160C (objective), or from -10C to +160C
(threshold). The sensor must be capable of providing a visual indicator
that can be inspected by a maintainer, and an electronic output signal
that can interface with an aircraft's caution and warning system to
alert the aircrew. The warning should be triggered when toxic
hydrocarbon contaminants have breached the oxygen system and oxidizing
catalyst and entered the pilot's breathing oxygen.    Current sensor
technology consists primarily of electrochemical cells and solid state
detectors capable of sensing single components. These sensors tend to
lack the response time, reliability, and robustness needed for military
aircraft. Compact, multi-component, highly reliable sensors that do not
drift over time are required for this application. The ideal technology
will have sensitivity in the part-per-million range, be compact and
light weight, and require minimal power. Weight limits should not exceed
 1 pound, and volume limits should not exceed 2.5 inches in height, 10
inches in width, and 8 inches in depth.     PHASE I: Determine concept
feasibility and should culminate with a working prototype to demonstrate
 the sensor's capability of detecting toxic hydrocarbons along with the
capability of providing a visual indicator for maintainers, and an
electronic output to interface with the aircraft's caution and warning
system. Phase I shall include a draft of systems requirements for
aircraft integration including environmental qualification testing.
PHASE II: Refine the operational system requirements based on the
aircraft selected for flight testing. Utilize the Systems Engineering
Process for solidifying the system requirements, conducting preliminary
and critical design reviews, and producing flight worthy prototype
hardware for concept demonstration testing.    PHASE III: Finalization
of the design, low rate initial production, followed by full production.
    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS:
Commercial and civil aviation are transitioning from traditional high
pressure gaseous and liquid oxygen systems to OBOGS. Additionally,
point-of-use oxygen generators are being developed for ground

randomness of typical signal intelligence (SIGINT) signal spaces with
sampling techniques that can sample a signal space at lower sampling
rates without losing any information, or conversely, obtain more
information from the signal space from without increasing sample rate.
  DESCRIPTION: Typical SIGINT collection platforms attempt to collect
signal information over a wide RF spectrum for extended periods of time,
 resulting in large amounts of data that need to be transported off the
platform through sometimes limited-bandwidth communications links. With
new communications services and radar systems being developed over an
ever-expanding RF spectrum, the job of covering all signals of interest,
 and handling the large amount of associated data, is becoming more of a
 challenge for data collection platforms such as the E-2 Hawkeye and
Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS). This is especially true in the
case of communications intelligence (COMINT), in which it may be
desirable to send samples of signals off-board for analysis.    Although
 the typical signal space is in fact busy, it is also commonly the case
that the signals in the space are randomly spaced within the spectrum,
and that there are substantial portions of the spectrum that are empty.
These empty spaces are not necessarily known a priori, thus, when
conventional Nyquist-type sampling is used, it is necessary to sample
the space at sufficiently high speeds to cover the entire space, even
the unknown blank regions.    It is desirable to exploit the relative
sparseness and randomness of typical SIGINT signal spaces with sampling
techniques that can sample a signal space at lower sampling rates
without losing any information, or conversely, obtain more information
from the signal space from without increasing sample rate. This would,
for example, reduce the demands on air-to-ground links that would be
used to transport samples of COMINT signals to ground-station analysis
centers.    PHASE I: Identify methods of improving high efficiency
SIGINT data collection and assess their feasibiilty in use on Navy
aircraft. Select one or more critical hypotheses for small scale
experimentation if necessary to support prototyping algorithms and
approaches.     PHASE II: Develop and prototype the approach on one or
more aircraft and\/or one or more frequency band of interest. May pilot
the approach with proof of concept for ground use on an aircraft with a
frequency band of interest.    PHASE III: Apply lessons learned to
develop and produce high efficiency SIGINT collection for Navy aircraft.

processes can create complex, three-dimensional parts akin to castings,
but without the high costs and logistical difficulties associated with
the production and maintenance of larger-scale manufacturing facilities
(e.g., foundries). However, the range of alloys that DDM can be applied
to is currently highly limited and oftentimes accompanied by significant
 property sacrifices relative to the baseline (wrought or cast) alloys
[1]. Additionally, the certification of DDM-produced components for
airworthiness is time-consuming and expensive [2]. With recent advances
in computational materials design [3] and process-structure-property
modeling [4], the Navy is interested in the development of high
performance materials specifically developed for DDM. Materials of
interest include titanium, steel, and aluminum alloys for critical Navy
aerospace applications such as airframe structures, helicopter rotor
components, and other components of interest. The new materials should
demonstrate similar (if not better) static and fatigue properties to
incumbent alloys (wrought or cast). New materials may address current

support for real-time re-tasking and re-planning of multiple assets and
the ability to visualize data and information in a complex multi-domain

unmanned vehicles is performed routinely by operators. There is a
considerable amount of current development within both industry and
government in support of these activities based on concepts ranging from
 basic decision theory to full automation of single vehicles. SBIR
topics such as ONR managed N05-T017 NAVAIR PMA-281 managed N111-022
respectively titled Mixed-initiative Interaction Module for Littoral and
 Mine Warfare (MIIM-LMW) and Intelligent Proxies for Automated Mission
Planning focus on the automation of unmanned vehicle mission planning
problems. When simultaneously dealing with multiple unmanned vehicles in
 multiple domains the operator or mission commander's decision making
processes are impeded by current state-of-the-art capabilities to
display pertinent information. Limitations are inherent in current
control systems during re-planning and re-tasking of vehicles in
situations when target priorities change, a vehicle experiences a
malfunction or encounters fuel limitations or inclement weather
conditions and other situations. Decision making must be made in real
time and many scenarios increase the complexity of decision making to a
point which makes it nearly impossible for an operator to make the
necessary changes. Academia and industry are addressing the topic of
multi-vehicle, multi-domain, single operator issues as outlined in such
reports as [ref1, ref2]. Automating complex real-time mission planning
will demand development of not only novel, non-deterministic,
decision-theoretic, intelligent algorithms that can perform these
functions but also provide a unique human-computer interface to
visualize the problems and recommended decisions. Simplicity of
visualization will be required to allow operators uncomplicated control
of multi-vehicle, multi-domain operations. Development should be
conducted within an open architecture. Performance and evaluation
metrics will need to be established in order to determine the degree of
benefit of the solution. Ref3, Ref4 and Ref5 are sample reports from
academia and industry providing an overview of research related to the
topic. It does not imply endorsement nor guidance.    PHASE I: Develop

generating power and remotely transferring that power using by radio
frequency (RF) to power miniature active or passive RFID tags and
ensuring a read range adequate to support logistics and maintenance
functions. This will be used to facilitate individual parts and
component identification\/tracking of life-limited components, critical
safety times and high cost repairables. This is complimentary to current
 digital DNA efforts and will greatly improve upon current methods.
DESCRIPTION: Radio frequency identification (RFID) is becoming a common
tracking technology. The use of RFID to accurately track parts results
in cost savings due to traceability. The ability to precisely track
parts improves reliability of part usage data, supporting analysis to
potentially extend the life of the part and reduce maintenance efforts.
    Passive RFID systems are small and compact but are restricted in
readability range because of power limitations and available antenna
size. Active RFID's have a greater readability range but require primary
 batteries, greatly increasing the package size relative to passive
RFID's. The goal is to develop a RFID tag that combines the size of a
Passive RFID and the readability range of an Active RFID by
wirelessly\/remotely powering or recharging the battery in the RFID tag.
 Developing such an RFID would combine the advantages of the passive and
 active RFID's and eliminate some of their individual disadvantages.
 The RFID tag dimensions and weight should be insignificant and must not
 interfere with the aircraft functionality. Therefore, tag size
optimization is critical to the design and form factor and must be part
of the study. In addition, the RFID tag should be strategically located
to remotely access for data communication and power source. It is
required that the RFID tags be mounted with the antenna on, or in close
proximity to, metallic surfaces. A recharge range of 10 meters is
required when using an RF source, preferably a source that complies with
 FCC Part 15, intentional radiators in license free ISM bands. Mounted
RFID's must be able to endure aircraft environment; endure vibration,
hot-wet and corrosive environments, radiation, and high pressures.
Whether active or passive, the RFID tag should be compliant with DoD
RFID\/UID requirements with a frequency of 433 MHz or 915 MHz and ISO
18000 or ePC, respectively for active and passive RFID tags and achieve a
 read range in excess of ten meters.    PHASE I: Develop an innovative

peak E-field levels while simultaneously raising the average E-field
levels of four of the standard Intersystem EMC electromagnetic
environments that aircraft must operate in and demonstrate survivability

standard RF environment into a peak and an average field level test
instead of a single environment that provided both at the same time like
 the aircraft would see when deployed. The best technology for testing
purposes currently in existence that is closest to our requirements is a
 type of close coupled cavity TWT (Traveling wave-tube). However, TWT
amplifiers leak approximately 1 watt when they are in operate mode and
this has caused systems to fail that should not.     The concept

superconducting systems (such as degaussing, propulsion motors,
electrical generators and power distribution systems) for use onboard
future ships and submarines to reduce system weight, energy usage and
installed volume. These systems rely on the use of cryogenic helium gas
for operation. Helium has a low heat capacity at the operational
temperatures of 10-150K and significant amounts of heat from 100-4000W
need to be removed from these systems during operation. Current
commercially available cryogenic heat exchangers utilize a combination
of stainless steel and copper helix coils wrapped around a mass of metal
 (Ref 1).  Gaseous helium is then pumped through the coils in order to
convectively and conductively transfer cooling power from the cryocooler
 to the superconducting system. Current heat exchanger designs have a
heat exchanger effectiveness of about 70%, weigh approximately 50lbs,
and maintain a pressure drop of less than 1 psi. The current equipment
package required to transfer the heat (cold box containing the heat
exchanger plus a cryocooler) weighs approximately 350 lbs and costs
approximately $75K (Ref 2).  Given the amount of potential heat to be

reduction in the overall weight and cost of the system.  Novel materials
 such as metal foams and matrix materials have been investigated for
cryogenic heat exchangers but have not been implemented because of their

material(s) and manufacturing processes, develop a mooring fixture to
replace the existing bitt and\/or chock configuration onboard naval
surface ships.    DESCRIPTION: Presently, both the naval and commercial
industry use carbon steel bitts and chocks to properly tie-up or moor a
ship (Ref 2 and 3). For DDG 51 Class ships, those bitts and chocks,
which are located on the flight deck, are limited in their allowable
height above the deck by specifications pertaining to helicopter
operations. As a result, they are recessed into the deck itself.
Raising and lowering the bitts and chocks are manual operations
requiring as many as four individuals (due to the weight of the
assemblies in excess of 270 lbs) and also require the use of specialized
 tools. Once raised, both are locked in the"up"position. For the bitt
assembly, there is a rubber gasket seal at the deck opening which fits
tight to the bitt barrel for the purpose of preventing water from
reaching the decks below. Both have either 2-inch or 4-inch drain lines
to facilitate water exiting the pockets in which the fixtures are
stowed. Naval flight decks are a highly corrosive environment, and
corrosion rapidly affects the operation of these mooring fixtures due to
 their weight, tight tolerances and method of operation. Bitt and chock
assembly corrosion and the subsequent degradation of system performance
are top recurring issues for DDG CLASSRON. The effort to reduce manning
has forced prioritization with regards to maintenance and the attention
the crew is able to pay to these mooring fixtures often suffers as a
result. Limited personnel and the flight deck"s highly corrosive
environment present a recurring and costly maintenance challenge. System
 failure results in a reduced mooring capability, increased maintenance
time and frequency, and as a result, increased life-cycle costs.
This topic seeks to explore innovative approaches to resolve a
long-standing, life-cycle management issue for DDG 51 Class ships.
Proposers are encouraged to explore alternative design solutions,
manufacturing processes and\/or material systems with robust mechanical
properties to withstand the harsh operating environment seen by these
mooring fixtures on a daily basis. Proposers are also encouraged to
explore solutions that provide a combined (bitt and chock) functionality
 to deliver equivalent performance within the footprint of the allotted
space onboard ships (Ref 1). Proposers will need to be mindful of the
requirement to provide a solution that can be recessed within the
storage pocket of the deck and should address the ability to be sealed
to prevent water intrusion into adjacent spaces. Proposed concepts
should be simple to maintain and operate. Material systems proposed
should not be predisposed to galvanic corrosion. In addition, proposers
should address the method of deployment and locking, with the use of
minimal manpower. Meeting the need for reduced maintenance and increased
 operational reliability and maintainability in a maritime environment
represents the most significant challenge associated with a bitt and
chock replacement design solution.    PHASE I: Demonstrate the
feasibility of a replacement retractable mooring fixture and its ability
 to reliably operate in the presence of corrosion. Proposers should
identify suitable configurations, candidate materials, equipment,
manufacturing processes and methods of installation anticipated to
enable the development and integration of the proposed system. Establish
 performance goals and metrics to analyze the viability of the proposed

 well as a test and evaluation plan with performance goals and key
technical milestones to be utilized to verify performance and
suitability.    PHASE II: Develop, demonstrate and fabricate a prototype
 as identified in Phase I. In a laboratory environment, demonstrate that
 the prototype system meets the performance goals established in Phase
I. The prototype will be evaluated to determine its capability in
meeting the performance goals defined in Phase II development and

Navy ships is critical to the operation of shipboard electronic systems.
 Quiet and reliable cooling technology is especially important for ship
control systems. On the VIRGINIA Class submarine, most ship control
equipment uses forced air cooling. Water cooling is not presently used
because it creates a dependency on cooling water systems, lowering ship
control system availability and reliability. However, the current ship
control cooling fans in use on VIRGINIA Class have a large number of
mechanical parts, requiring significant noise qualification and
reliability testing. Furthermore, space and weight is very important
aboard submarines and the additional space for cooling fans make
arrangements challenging.     It is expected that the OHIO Replacement

better system is developed. The Navy would like to reduce the footprint
of the cooling system and eliminate the use of fan cooling (and
subsequent noise qualification testing), while maintaining the
reliability of the ship control station. Although there are currently
non-mechanical cooling systems used in industry, such as heat pipes,
these technologies cannot always be adapted for Navy Submarine use
because of material concerns (see references 1 and 2). However,
companies applying to this SBIR should be encouraged to leverage
commercial-off-the-shelf cooling technologies wherever applicable.
The Navy is seeking innovative technologies and methods to address the
cooling problems it is having with ship control electronic equipment.
Innovation should minimize the use of mechanical components such as
fans, consider the use of heat pipes, and investigate innovative
alternative materials for control equipment enclosures. All heat
transfer methods must meet the required cooling loads (estimated to be
1kW) and be constructed of approved materials for use on US Navy

cooling system requirements, will be prepared. Prepare a development
plan for Phase II with performance goals and key technical milestones.
  PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II development
 plan, the small business will develop and evaluate a prototype cooling
system to determine its effectiveness in cooling ship control stations
within the performance goals defined in Phase I and the requirements
above. Based on the results of the evaluations, the small business will
develop a preliminary design that can be implemented on the OHIO
Replacement Class submarine. Develop a Phase III development plan to
transition the technology into a system that can be acquired by the
Navy.    PHASE III: If Phase II is successful, the small business will
be expected to support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy
use should a Phase III award be made. Based on the Phase II results, the
 small business will develop an enclosure cooling system for the ship
control station for shipboard testing. The small business will support
evaluation aboard ship and in qualifying and certifying the system for
use on the OHIO Replacement Class submarine and for back fit to the
VIRGINIA Class submarine.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL

        "topic_name": "Innovative Approach to the Control of Vacuum
Collection, Holding and Transfer (VCHT) Foaming",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop an innovative approach to
detect and control or eliminate foaming in sewage VCHT tanks and systems
 onboard naval ships without the use of biological or hazardous
materials.    DESCRIPTION: Currently used DDG 52 AF Class sewage VCHT
systems are highly susceptible to foaming. Foam can be generated in the
VCHT tank due to the combination of liquid and solid human waste,
freshwater flushing and detergents being re-circulated through the
ejector pump and ejectors at high velocities. VCHT tank vents, which are
 under atmospheric pressure (14.7 pounds per square inch gauge (psig)),
are vented to the weather decks onboard ship. Once foam enters the tank
vent and tank overflow piping in sufficient quantity to prevent the
venting of pressure and hazardous fumes from the tank, pressure builds
up inside the tank as a result of frequent in-rush of sewage and air
from the ejector pumps. The tanks become pressurized (approximately 15
20 psig and at some point force the foam from the tank out through the
tank vent onto the weather deck (Ref 1).  In addition, the foam clogs
sensors, and causes premature pump failure due to the easily cavitating
foam in the ejector pump. Traditionally, foam generation inside VCHT
tanks has required Ship"s Force to: a) deactivate the sewage collection
system; b) flush and clean the VCHT tanks, which is time consuming and
often ineffective; c) increase ejector pump corrective maintenance
(repair) as a result of the damage from foam, which is costly, dangerous
 and impacts system availability. Previous attempts at resolving this
issue have resulted in numerous engineering modifications to reduce the
occurrence of foam generation in VCHT tanks and subsequent spills
through the tank vents. While changes to date have effectively
segregated plumbing waste from the VCHT tanks, foam reduction due to
these actions has not been adequate and continues to be an un-resolved
issue of concern. In the commercial maritime industry, some Marine
Sanitation Device (MSD) manufacturers recommend pouring diesel fuel in
to the VCHT tanks to mitigate foaming, but this method is neither
recommended nor approved since it introduces oily waste into a sewage
system, which is regulated by different discharge standards.     This
topic seeks to explore the development of innovative approaches to
detect and mitigate the effects of foam generation in sewage VCHT tanks
(Ref 2 and 3). Proposed concepts must be non-biological and
non-hazardous, should provide an indication of when foam is detected
inside VCHT tanks and should mitigate, by control and\/or elimination,
the effects of foam on sewage collection system operations. While foam
detection is not the sole focus of this topic, it is important for
several reasons.  In practice, a foam mitigation system may not be
required to function at all times during VCHT tank operation, but only
during times when foam generation has been detected. Additionally, the
ability to detect the presence of foam is important in order to be able
to determine the effectiveness of the foam countermeasures proposed.
Proposers should address proposed candidate processes, materials,
equipment(s), and manufacturing processes, as applicable, as well as
methods of installation anticipated to enable the development and
integration of a detection and mitigation solution(s). Specifically,
concepts proposed should contribute to a reduction in corrective
maintenance and total ownership costs as well as improving system
availability and may be considered for application on LPD 17 Class,
LCS-1 and LCS-3 VCHT systems as well.     PHASE I: Demonstrate the
feasibility of the development of an innovative approach(es) to detect
and counter-act VCHT foam generation or otherwise mitigate its effects
in VCHT tanks and systems based on the requirements above. With an
emphasis on counter-acting foam generation, the company will demonstrate
 the feasibility of the concepts in meeting the Navy needs and will
establish that the concepts can be feasibly developed into a useful
product for the Navy. The feasibility demonstration will include Rough
Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimates for system acquisition, daily
operation and maintenance requirements, system size and how it would be
integrated on a VCHT Tank as well as a notional commercialization plan
and will identify any potential safety hazards associated with the
proposed concepts. The company will provide a Phase II development plan
and schedule with performance goals that contains discrete milestones
for product development and will be utilized to verify candidate
concept(s) performance and suitability.    PHASE II: Based on the
results of Phase I and the Phase II development plan, the company will
develop a scaled prototype for evaluation. In a laboratory environment,
demonstrate that the prototype system meets the performance goals
established in Phase I. Perform a safety analysis of the modified system
 and any consumable materials and identify any potential safety hazards
associated with the proposed concepts. Provide a detailed Phase III
development plan for certification, validation, and method of
implementation into a future ship test and\/or design environment.
Prepare refined cost estimates for system acquisition, daily operation
and maintenance requirements as well as logistics data packages, and
interface documents for use in both forward fit and retrofit ship
programs. Refine the commercialization plan.    PHASE III: Upon
successful completion of Phase II, the company will work with government
 and industry, as applicable, to construct a prototype based on the
Phase II results for testing in a shipboard environment. The full-scale
prototype will then be installed onboard a selected DDG 52 AF class hull
 and extended shipboard testing will be conducted. Upon successful
completion of the testing, validation, certification and qualification
requirements, the technology will be incorporated for use onboard naval
ships as practicable. The company will support the Navy for test and
validation to certify and qualify the system for Navy use.    PRIVATE
SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: These systems are
installed in most modern warships, cruise ships and other commercial
cargo or personnel carriers. Any vacuum collected non-oily wastewater
(including sewage) system will also have foam-generation issues and
should benefit from the developed product.",

Weapons Stations",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a series of reconfigurable
and non-reconfigurable advanced ballistic shields for crew served
weapons stations.    DESCRIPTION: The existing 10 Crew Served Weapons
Stations (CSWS) aboard CVN 68 class ships do not have ballistic shields
installed. Commercially available ballistic shields do not meet
shipboard integration requirements or military levels of ballistic
defeat, and are too heavy and cumbersome to be rapidly reconfigured as
shipboard operations dictate. Handling or routinely reconfiguring by
personnel is generally not considered and presents a unique problem set.
 Innovation is required to develop ballistic protection that not only
exceeds what is currently available in terms of ballistic defeat, but
addresses the difficult issues associated with human systems integration
 and shipboard integration and operations. There is a need for the
development of innovative concepts for a series of reconfigurable and
non-reconfigurable ballistic shields.    It is intended that
reconfiguration to remove interference with ship"s operations be
accomplished without having to remove and stow the shields in a separate
 location. The development of shields for locations where
reconfiguration is not necessary is also intended, and requires
innovative integration techniques to minimize ship impact. The following
 ballistic defeat threshold and objective is intended: Caliber .50 MK
263 AP bullets with a specified mass of 48.6 grams (750 grains) and a
velocity of 887 meters per second (2910 feet per second), and
14.5-millimeter API-32 bullets with a specified mass of 64 grams (990
grains) and a velocity of 914 meters per second (3000 feet per second)
respectively. The shields are intended to meet defined environmental
loads and factors, human systems, ship and weapons interfaces, and
protection dimensions.  Global Security and Federation of American
Scientists websites have various articles pertaining to small arms,
ballistic defeat materials and U.S. Navy ships (see References 1-3).
Photos of shipboard crew served weapons stations can be found at photo
posting sites (see References 4-5), Wikipedia and various Navy websites
including navy.mil and navy.com.    PHASE I: The company will conduct
the necessary R&amp;D to develop innovative concepts for a series of
reconfigurable and non-reconfigurable ballistic shields that meet the
requirements described above. Define and clearly illustrate the
ballistic shield concepts and materials proposed to be used in Phase II,
 and CSWS arrangement techniques through use of computer modeling and
simulation, drawings, photographs, and data analyses. Clearly explain
the proposed ballistic defeat and shipboard integration methods and
provide supporting data that ensures environmental loading factors have
been taken into consideration. Provide all findings and any supporting
data in a final report. Provide a Phase II development plan with
performance goals and key technical milestones.    PHASE II: Based on
the results of Phase I and the Phase II development plan, the company
will produce prototype samples of each shield type. If variations in
materials and techniques within each type are intended for experiment,
samples of each variation shall be produced. Samples shall exhibit all
of the physical configuration, materials and ship"s interface features
as the proposed production units including mounting features and
hardware, coatings and markings, in addition to the primary ballistic
defeat components. Samples shall be subjected to ballistics testing as
defined by the Navy. Computer modeling and simulation will be used for
selected environmental tests. The company shall provide test samples and
 all findings, test reports, collected data and supporting photographs,
video, and modeling results in a final report.    PHASE III: If Phase II
 is successful, the company will work with a selected shipbuilder
and\/or prime contractor-integrator to refine the ballistic shield
design and manufacturing process for cost effective production. Test
fixtures will be produced representative of deck, bulwark, life rail or
other ship structure for mounting test articles as intended for
shipboard integration. Prototype test articles shall be subjected to
environmental loading tests including shock and wave slap.  Additional
ballistics testing will be performed if required as a result of design
modifications.  Subsequent to successful environmental and ballistics
prototype testing, the company will develop a complete ship set of CSW
station ballistic shield manufacturing and installation drawings for a
selected ship. The company will manufacture all shields and one spare of
 each type necessary to outfit the ship. Working with the shipbuilder,
prime contractor-integrator and\/or Alteration Installation Team, the
company will install appropriate shields at all CSW stations, and will
provide documentation and training to Ship"s Force on the
reconfiguration and maintenance of the shields as necessary. The
selected ship will conduct sea trials of installed shields during
scheduled underway periods. Together with NSWCCD, the company will
collect data on shields"performance based on Ship"s Force reports and
inspections conducted during in port periods and will provide PMS 312
with a report of findings and a recommended plan ahead.    PRIVATE

        "topic_name": "Enhanced De-Interleavers for Submarine Electronic
 Warfare Support (ES) Systems",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to develop
innovative algorithms and techniques to automatically detect, classify,
and uniquely identify emitters exhibiting multi-dimensional agilities,
extremely wide band RF distribution, high time bandwidth coherent
characteristics, and solid state power amplifier technologies.
DESCRIPTION: As the submarine"s electronic operational environment
becomes increasingly complex and dense, the AN\/BLQ-10 (the submarine
Electronic Warfare (EW) system) cannot provide accurate data to the
Electronic Warfare Support (ES) operator. The automatic functions of the
 system are not keeping pace with the new technology in emitters being
fielded. This forces the operator to spend the majority of his time
processing, verifying accuracy, correlating, and trying to provide
timely operational information to decision makers. Consequently, ES
operators are drawn from their primary responsibilities of ship safety,
self protection, and 360 degree situational awareness to a more time
consuming effort of signal recognition and analysis.     De-interleaving
 is the process of taking random RF energy as it is received by the ES
system and sorting the energy into cluster\/groups so that all the
received energy from individual emitters is separated out into their
individual components. De-interleaving is the process used to ensure all
 pulses being used to identify an emitter actually come from the same
emitter and are not being intermingled with other emitter pulses.
Submarine ES operators need de-interleaving techniques that can deal
with the rapid proliferation of extremely complex emissions. These new
target sets are agile in multiple dimensions simultaneously, can exhibit
 random \/ pseudo random characteristics in all parameters, and are
demonstrating a trend to lower peak power transmissions yet maintaining
extremely capable detection properties through coherent integration.
The complex electronic environment of today demands newer algorithms to
be able to detect, classify, localize, and uniquely identify the current
 extremely agile emitters and the new solid state radars.     Current
State of the Art capabilities for de-interleavers do not address these
new emitter types.  State of the Art for the detection and
classification of LPI emitters is the PENNANT\/SHAWNA capability and it
cannot handle these new emitter classes.  It is extremely capable
against first generation coherent emitters, but the second and third
generation coherent emitters are too complex for the current capability
to classify and identify them.  For the current generation of radars
that are demonstrating agilities on a pulse by pulse basis, the
traditional delta Tau de-interleavers are inadequate.  These emitters
change their parameters so frequently that the current state of the art
algorithms cannot adequately detect, classify or identify them.    The
Navy is seeking de-interleavers that do not require a priori knowledge
of the emitters to be able to automatically detect, classify, and
uniquely identify the extremely complex emissions of today and tomorrow.
 This must be performed in real time while operating in extremely dense
littoral mission areas.     Specific items that will need to be
addressed:   1) Radars that can change Pulse Repetition Interval (PRI),
Pulse Width (PW), Frequency (RF) on a pulse by pulse basis.   2) Radars
that can change their Intra-Pulse Characteristics on a Pulse by Pulse
basis.   3) Radars that can change their Inter-Pulse Characteristics on a
 Pulse by Pulse basis.   4) Radars that are very low power (less than
200 Watts peak transmit power).   5) Radars that are extremely low power
 (less than 10 Watts Peak transmit power).   6) Real time processing of a
 dense environment (greater than 5 Million pulses per second in a 10
millisecond burst; and greater than 2 million pulses per second at a
sustained rate)   7) Pulse widths varying from 10 nanoseconds to 10
milliseconds wide   8) Frequency agility greater than 400 MHz wide   9)
Emitters exhibiting phase coded RF properties.    The current
capabilities of the AN\/BLQ-10 are severely handicapped by the
proprietary nature of the individual subsystem (Early Warning receiver
(EWR), Radar Wideband (RWB), Radar Narrowband (RNB), Specific Emitter
Identification (SEID), Advanced Processing Receiver (APR), Automatic
Direction Finding (ADF) and Improved Communication Acquisition and DF
(ICADF)) and the age of the systems involved (ADF is greater than 20
years old and RWB and RNB are each greater than 15 years old).  These
systems do not have the capability of de-interleaving today's complex
emitter sets. There are currently no current techniques available to
perform the de-interleaving of these complex emitters of today's
operational environment.    The NAVSEA PMS435 need is to develop new
de-interleavers that can automatically detect, classify and uniquely
identify these new complex emitters, allowing the operator to spend his
time performing ship safety and self protection vice signal analysis and
 classification.  These new algorithms must be open architecture in
nature and easily extensible as future radars create new requirements.
  The Phase I effort will not require access to classified information.
If need be, data of the same level of complexity as secured data will be
 provided to support Phase I work. The Phase II effort will likely
require secure access, and the contractor will need to be prepared for
personnel and facility certification for secure access.      PHASE I:
The company will develop concepts for autonomous algorithms to
de-interleave extremely complex radar emissions in real time that meet
the requirements identified above. Demonstrate the feasibility of the
concepts in de-interleaving these emitters in extremely dense RF
environments with a very high degree of accuracy (&gt;90% correct
reports) for operators within the requirements described above.
Demonstrate the feasibility of technology development to achieve the
objective. Develop and evaluate breadboard concepts of key technology
components. Prepare a Phase II development plan with performance goals
and key developmental milestones and identify risks and risk mitigation
efforts.    PHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II
development plan, develop a working prototype of the selected concept.
Evaluate the prototype in the laboratory to prove the ability of the
concept to meet performance goals established in Phase I and Phase II
development plan. Based on the results of the evaluation, finalize the
concept into a preliminary design. Develop a detailed plan and method of
 implementation into a full-scale application.    PHASE III: If Phase II
 is successful, the small business will be expected to support the Navy
in transitioning the technology to Navy use should a Phase III award be
made. The small business will implement the Phase III plan developed in
Phase II and will prepare a manufacturing plan for the technology. The
small business will be expected to make the necessary teaming
arrangements with the manufacturers of the components used in end
product.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS:
The US Coast Guard and Homeland Defense have a need (requirement) to be

        "topic_name": "Seam Engineering: Stitchless Seam Technology",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this Small Business
Innovative Research (SBIR) opportunity is to systematically investigate
and analyze current and evolving stitchless seam technologies, and to
evaluate their use in existing Navy clothing end-items. The desired end
result would be a reduction in bulk and weight, enhanced performance
characteristics such as moisture management (breathability), wind\/water
 resistance, durability, abrasion resistance, flexibility and improved
ergonomics. In conjunction with improved technical performance, a
reduction to end item costs will be realized through manufacturing
efficiencies given the speed of the proposed processes.  Furthermore,
rapid prototyping of test quantities could be employed using the
selected technology in support of developmental garment programs versus
current cost-prohibitive approaches.    DESCRIPTION: Historically,
production methods for clothing manufacturing involve traditional labor
intensive mechanical stitching processes in conjunction with operator
precision which involves a variety of stitch types, each utilizing a
specific sewing machine.  The construction of a typical garment would
incorporate many stitch types and associated machines requiring
virtually endless transportation from station to station as the garment
is formed.  Detrimental to the garment performance and functionality are
 overlapping and complex seams in areas such as the crotch, armhole,
neck, cuff, pocket, waistband, and hems.  These areas are the source of
increased bulk and a source of abrasion and potential failure.  In the
case of high performance technical apparel, seam sealing tape is applied
 to the sewn seam to prevent penetration of liquids, chemicals and
particulates. This seam sealing operation can add as many as eleven
yards of tape to a garment, thereby increasing bulk, weight and
stiffness.  The process of sewing and seam sealing adds approximately
25% to the manufacturing costs and therefore presents a fine opportunity
 to realize cost savings.    PHASE I: Phase I will examine and rank
novel stitch-free technology processes currently in development by
manufacturers. The investigation would include welded seams, adhesive
techniques or unique bonding mechanisms.      Promising concepts will be
 produced and compared to traditional sewn seams using a variety of
internationally recognized standards and test methods such as those
referenced in International Organization for Standardization (ISO), ASTM
 International, and the American Association of Textile Chemists and
Colorists (AATCC) to determine the most appropriate candidate
technologies prior to down selection and subsequent assembly of
pre-prototype garments. Tests of interest will include bonding\/seam
strength, hydrostatic pressure resistance, stiffness, dimensional
stability and durability predictions.  Results documenting the potential
 viability of novel seaming techniques into Navy garments will be
compiled into a final report with recommendations for Phase II.  It is
also envisioned that leap ahead technologies would emerge and could be
pursued in later Phases of the effort.     PHASE II: The focus of Phase
II will be to design, develop and test prototype garments utilizing the
best candidate stitch-free technologies selected from Phase I and to
conduct a manufacturing feasibility analysis.  A standard Navy garment
will be chosen as a demonstration model but it is anticipated that the
Parka, Navy Working Uniform (NWU) which utilizes both traditional
stitching and complex seam sealing techniques would be an excellent
example to assess the technologies"viability.  Garments will be
developed and subjected to laboratory durability prediction assessments
using multiple shipboard launderings, prior to laboratory testing.  The
best candidates will be subjected to a limited shipboard and shore side
user evaluation.  Following the wear test, they will be evaluated
through objective laboratory assessments and by collecting user feedback
 through focus groups to determine performance, durability, reduction of
 bulk and weight, operational compatibility and ease of care.    PHASE
III: Equipment and processes will be optimized for the selected
technology which will transition to end items on a prioritized basis and
 accompanying technical data packages updated to reflect the changes.
 PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: Alternate
seam technologies are employed in a variety of garment manufacturing
processes. They have been in the commercial market for several years,
however situations where seam strength is critical, the alternative
solutions did not create satisfactory results. Some manufacturers in the
 commercial sector have adopted stitchless seam technology in
recreational garments in the areas of pockets, zippers and
other"non-stress"seams. The technologies have evolved dramatically and
are worthy of consideration. This initiative will analyze the technology
 improvements.",

Transistors on Native GaN Substrates for Power Switching Applications",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop homoepitaxial GaN high
voltage (5000V) vertical power switching transistors on GaN substrates
to enable compact, efficient high power converters.    DESCRIPTION: GaN
power switching transistors have recently been demonstrated with
performance superior to conventional silicon (Si) or silicon carbide
(SiC) based devices.  The demonstrated GaN devices offer a better
combination of on-resistance, capacitance and breakdown voltage than
competing technologies.  However, GaN devices have been limited by the
non-native substrates (such as Si or SiC) required to date.  The
heteroepitaxy of GaN material on non-GaN substrates has led to lower
quality material and required thick GaN buffer layers to support the
depletion region required for high voltage devices, limiting practical
devices to ~1,500 volts (V).  The recent and on-going development of
high quality bulk GaN substrates offers the new possibility of GaN
transistors developed homoepitaxially on GaN substrates.  This approach
would reduce the requirement for thick GaN buffers, lowering materials
growth and process costs, as well as, open the door to new power device
topologies, such as vertical devices, which could potentially support up
 to 5 kilovolts (kV) with 50% lower resistance versus SiC devices.
State of the art is focused on Si, SiC and GaN devices.  Si devices are
the most mature but disadvantaged relative to Wide Bandgap (WBG)
materials (SiC and GaN) due to fundamental materials aspects that limit
breakdown field and on-resistance.  SiC materials are similar to GaN but
 are more developed with demonstrated Depletion Metal Oxide
Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (DMOSFET) devices operating up to
15kV.  Due to higher critical breakdown field, GaN offers the best
combination of fundamental materials properties for power switching but
has been exclusively developed on non-GaN substrates to date.  GaN
Schottky diodes have been demonstrated to benefit from free standing
substrates, but this effort will focus on transistor structures.
PHASE I: Design\/develop an innovative concept that demonstrates the
scientific merit and feasibility of developing a normally-off, high
voltage Field Effect Transistor (FET) technology in GaN on native GaN
substrates.  The effort will demonstrate a device approach that provides
 a blocking voltage of 5,000V, a threshold voltage&gt;1V, with a
specific on-resistance, RDS,ON-SP of 30 mOhm-cm2.  These specifications
are to be achieved in a vertical device geometry that is capable of
comparable frequency response characteristics to current SiC power
switching devices.    PHASE II: Demonstrate a device with a 1 amp drain
current while maintaining the blocking voltage at 5,000V, a threshold
voltage&gt;2V, and reducing the on-resistance, RDS,ON-SP to 20 mOhm
-cm2.  In addition the drain current collapse, RAC\/RDC, at 600V, will
be50%.    PHASE III: Demonstrate a device with a 5 amp drain current
with a blocking voltage to 5000V, a threshold voltage&gt;2V, and
reducing the on-resistance, RDS,ON-SP to 10 mOhm-cm2.  Reduce the drain
current collapse, RAC\/RDC, at 600V, to90%.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL
 POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: Normally-off GaN devices will replace
 Si in most power applications where improved efficiency is required.
This is currently a major drive in the commercial sector in an effort to

of Unmanned Systems",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate metrics for a
 team of decision makers, managing multiple autonomous vehicles, to
assess transaction efficiencies given autonomy and control
interventions.    DESCRIPTION: Unmanned systems currently require
increasingly large teams of operators.  Diagnostic system and operator
team metrics for teams of decision makers supporting these systems
largely do not exist.  Autonomy, currently being developed, will
transform the nature of these systems and the requirements of
warfighters to support them.  Tools and metrics to assess the impact of
autonomy, identify system performance issues, and to evaluate the impact
 of interventions do not currently exist.  This topic will provide tools
 to measure the impact of emerging autonomy systems on warfighter
manning and training requirements and ensure that the autonomous systems
 being developed meet the Navy"s operational objectives and life cycle
costs.    Autonomous systems will require warfighters to interact with
vehicles and other warfighters using higher-level information related to
 missions and tasks.  Alternative schemes for managing autonomous
systems are under development to achieve appropriate manning levels.  As
 unmanned systems increasingly involve multiple vehicles with different
levels of automation, the impact and utility of the autonomy to the
warfighter and the overall man-machine system must be evaluated.  New
metrics and assessment techniques to evaluate alternative schemes, given
 the autonomy, are desired for evaluating overall system effectiveness
and performance.  System-level metrics may include: efficiency of
warfighter control and information transactions, bandwidth impact, scope
 of control, and timeliness.  User-level metrics may include:
warfighter-autonomy expectation convergence, situational awareness,
information uncertainty and operator workload.  Metrics should result in
 a real-time, graphical model to aid in the visualization of transaction
 effectiveness and assist in the diagnosis of issues in the coordination
 of the human-machine system.  This topic seeks innovative proposals for
 evaluating the users and usage of autonomous systems.     PHASE I:
Conceptualize and design an innovative approach to assess performance of
 teams operating multiple autonomous vehicles.  The proposed approach
should describe human performance metrics and their application in
evaluating the operational use of autonomous systems.  Clearly state
what diagnostic requirements are anticipated and how the proposed
approach would address them.  Metrics should identify and quantify
critical, anticipated human performance capabilities and limitations
relevant to managing autonomous systems as well as mission-based
performance parameters.  Metrics could include: operator information
processing effectiveness, speed of decision making, minimization and\/or
 reduction of procedural errors, and tactical control performance.  The
proposed metrics should operate in real time and communicate with
operators in"quick look"graphical formats.  Successful metrics will
support both overall assessment of the autonomy in operational contexts
as well as diagnostic indicators of critical factors contributing to the
 observed performance.  Phase I must identify a proposed operational
context (i.e., application) for developing and demonstrating proposed
metrics that would be employed during Phase II.    PHASE II: Develop and
 demonstrate tools, techniques and metrics) to assess the management of
highly autonomous systems.  Conduct testbed-based validation in a lab or
 using a modeling and simulation environment.  Initial demonstrations
may be conducted using a notional scenario and synthetic data; however,
evaluations with actual data are desired by the end of Phase II.
Conduct one or more controlled experiments to validate tools and
quantifiably demonstrate their benefit in improved team decision-making
performance.  Prepare guidelines and documentation for transition of the
 tool to an operational setting.  Use the results of the development
phase to build and test a prototype to assess the impact of system
design changes (e.g., different autonomy designs) on team performance in
 a subsurface or similar tactical environment.    PHASE III: Conduct
testing to validate, standardize, and document metric evaluation and
assessment software and implement in a field experiment.  Collect
performance data with an autonomous system to validate improved
performance.  Develop guidelines and documentation for transition to an
operational setting.  Field-test the tool in an operational setting and
produce improved performance measures.  Implement the tool in a

        "topic_name": "Interactive Generative Manifold Learning",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop techniques or mechanisms
whereby a human operator may describe and\/or generate previously unseen
 realizations of target data based on a low-dimensional representation
learned from a training dataset (i.e., without a physical model.)
DESCRIPTION: Within the field of target recognition, the use of manifold
 learning has become increasingly popular and powerful (Ref. 1-3).
Consider a classic example from facial recognition where a dataset is
comprised of a single face imaged at many rotations (e.g., profile,
head-on, etc.).  In this example, a learned manifold would be low
dimensional (here, one-dimensional) and correspond to rotation angle.
There would be a corresponding mapping from the high-dimensional space
of the image (where the dimensionality equals number of pixels) to the
low-dimensional manifold.  Therefore any point on the manifold would
correspond to an image of the face at that given rotation.  Recent
advances have developed generative models for manifolds as well as
one-to-one mappings (Ref. 4).  Therefore, it is now possible to pick any
 arbitrary point along a manifold and map it back into the high
dimensional space.  This allows one to generate previously unseen data
directly from the manifold without a physical model of the process that
generated the data.  The purpose is to enable the human to
both"explore"and"describe"target characteristics beyond those
represented by existing datasets.    The goal of this effort is to
investigate methods and develop techniques for a human operator to
explore high-dimensional data by: 1) traversing along the
low-dimensional manifold in a meaningful, intuitive, and efficient
manner (i.e., interpolating along the existing manifold); and 2)
exploring data that either lives on the existing manifold beyond the
currently characterized regions or exists on an expanded manifold of
larger dimensionality (i.e., extrapolating beyond the existing
manifold).  This later focus on extrapolation is aimed at leveraging the
 expertise of the human operator to characterize manifestations in the
data that have not been sufficiently sampled yet are well understood by
the human.  For example, in the facial recognition problem,
manifestations due to head tilting, illumination effects, or facial
gestures may be present to a minor degree.  These manifestations could
be brought out by the operator, characterized, and used to generate
additional previously unseen data.     It is emphasized that facial
recognition is used here as an example only; the high-dimensional data
of interest to this effort may be imagery, video, etc., derived from
electro-optic, sonar, radar, etc.  Additionally, the data
characteristics to be interactively explored by the human include any
meaningful characteristics of the data (e.g., target shape, pose,
appearance, motion, motion characteristics, background effects).
Finally, recall that a low-dimensional manifold may still have
dimensionality greater than three; therefore, a significant portion of
this effort should focus on how the human may effectively interact with
the low-dimensional data to explore the implications in the
high-dimensional representation.    PHASE I: Investigate methods and
techniques for a human operator to generate meaningful, previously
unseen data in a high-dimensional space by exploring a low-dimensional
manifold in an intuitive and efficient manner (i.e., the interpolation
goal).  For Phase I, developers should use their own data, publicly
available data, or data they acquire after approval by the technical
point of contact (TPOC) (i.e., data will not be provided by the
government for Phase I).  The nature of this data is less important and
may, in general, be anything that is intuitive to a human (e.g., camera
images, video).  Additionally, the data provided by the performers need
not be from a military application.    The option period will ensure
that the methods and techniques investigated in the base effort are
amenable to manifolds of dimensionality greater than three.  It will
also begin investigating methods and techniques for exploring data
beyond the currently characterized regions of the existing manifold and
extending the dimensionality of the existing manifold in a meaningful
way, the extrapolation goal.    PHASE II: Develop prototype software
system complete with user interface for both interpolation and
extrapolation.  Phase II will be initiated with data provided by the
developer; however, the government may elect to provide additional data
and\/or sensing modalities as appropriate.  Again, the nature of the
data is secondary; the primary focus of this effort should be on the
interaction between the human and the data.     The option period will
be used to expand the robustness and effectiveness of the interface with
 the human.  Emphasis here will be placed on the extrapolation goal.
PHASE III: Extend the software to operate effectively, be robust, and be
 fault tolerant to a full spectrum of government-provided data.  This
will involve significant coordination with a government laboratory to
fully integrate and test in the program of record.    PRIVATE SECTOR
COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: This capability is

 gathering training data. Therefore, it has significant

 methods for the fabrication of vector velocity sensors from relaxor

 sensors provide major system gains over legacy arrays of
omnidirectional hydrophones in bottom moored and submarine\/unmanned
undersea vehicle (UUV) towed applications.  For example, the left-right
ambiguity of legacy devices is eliminated and an array sensitivity null
can be steered at a noisy source of interference making much quieter
targets detectable.  The exceptionally sensitive, compact accelerometers
 made possible by the new relaxor piezocrystals are the key enabler for
this performance enhancement.  Since these sensors are only millimeters
in size and are required in large numbers, a major technical hurdle for
this technology is to devise cost-effective ways to manufacture the
vector sensor.  A cost model, relating the component and touch labor
costs, is needed for the various design options.  Once the dominant cost
 drivers have been identified, approaches to reducing costs, either
through reducing component or labor costs, are essential if the Navy is
to benefit from the new technology.    A variety of accelerometer
designs are under development for these vector velocity sensors, for
example, cantilevered-beams, shear-mode, and pressure-gradient devices.
 While acoustic performance is the primary driver in the choice of
device configuration, cost will ultimately determine the acquisition
choice.    PHASE I: Devise cost-effective innovative technologies to

capable of handling diverse, agile signals in an energy efficient manner
 in a dense signal environment.    DESCRIPTION: Signals of interest
(SOI) are becoming much more frequency agile, numerous, and have a low
probability of intercept (LPI) by design, making signal recognition and
classification much harder. The saturation of state-of-the-art Si clock
speeds, increased operational tempo, and surging interest in
light-weight, low-power, distributed sensors have focused attention on
low latency, energy efficient digital signal processing. Re-optimization
 of signal classifiers is needed to allow discrimination based on
agilely defined subsets of a large set of potential attributes which
differentiate specific SOI. Initial ambiguity regarding which attributes
 are required call for multiple interpretation hypotheses to be
generated, their reality probability evolved, and the branching set
thinned every time a new piece of information is received. A method for
backing up to still viable hypotheses when new information assigns a low
 probability to a previously high probability hypothesis is needed. The
virtue of maintaining an evolving database of all the signals currently
in the environment, as a way of eliminating the need to recategorize
packeted and discretely pulsed signals, could be considered. Systems
capable of differentiating receiver caused spurs and intermodulation

of the new system to keep up in real-time with an evolving situation

agility. This sort of energy efficient signal classification will also
assist base stations in sorting the signal environment into paying
users, non-disruptive interlopers, and spectral interlopers who are
disruptive and should be pursued (e.g., thorough the civil courts). The

 Acoustic countermeasures, deployed from ships and submarines, serve as
decoys by mimicking the acoustic signature of the vessel.  These
autonomous devices require a highly efficient, high-power, broadband,
compact acoustic source to achieve their goals.  The combination of the
most effective acoustic radiator design (i.e., a sphere) and the new
high-coupling, high-strain relaxor piezocrystals provides an optimum
combination to meet these exacting requirements.  The primary technical
challenge is to devise a cost-effective method of making a tiled
approximation to a sphere; much as current piezocrystal cylindrical
transducers are tiled approximations to a cylinder.  Other issues to be
addressed, primarily by modeling, include specifically the actuation
mode (d31 or d33) of the crystals, whether a fully active tiling is
appropriate or whether some passive tiles should be included, and the
implications of these choices for the drive electronics.    In these
applications both cylindrically and spherically shaped sources made from
 legacy piezoceramics have been employed with good results.  Segmented
cylinders of the relaxor piezocrystals provide a dramatic enhancement
over the legacy piezoceramic cylinders, matching their acoustic
performance in a package one hundredth the size requiring only half the

provide a similar step improvement over legacy piezoceramic technology.
    PHASE I: Design a transducer that closely approximates a sphere
using tiles made from plates of relaxor piezocrystals.  Model the
acoustic performance of the design: crystallographic orientation of the
plates, location of the electrodes, dimensions of the components and
overall transducer size for the frequency bands appropriate for acoustic
 countermeasures.  Devise a method to assemble a notional transducer and
 validate the feasibility of the assembly technique by making at least

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an analytical capability to
predict the response, in nanosecond time intervals, of highly

 The protection of vital spaces on ships is a critical concern.  Recent
efforts utilizing low-cost glassy, highly rate-sensitive materials
(e.g., conventional soda-lime glass, Plexiglas, and highly
rate-sensitive polyurea and polyurethane polymers) to defeat ballistic
and blast threats have been demonstrated.  These materials exhibit
strongly nonlinear, strain rate dependent behavior that can currently
only be determined by costly and time-consuming test series.  In order
to rapidly design and evaluate different configurations of these
materials, a modeling and simulation methodology is necessary to
evaluate the trade space.    The primary focus of this topic is to
develop an analytical capability\/method to predict the complex
responses, in nanosecond time intervals, of these highly rate-sensitive
materials when under stress.  This predictive method should capture the
transient levels of stability, support, and load transfer as well as the
 erosion characteristics and fracture and failure waves generated by
armor penetrators such as hypervelocity jets and fragments.        The
predictive method should be capable of characterizing: shockwave
propagations and interactions; the generation of failure waves;
granulation\/comminution; and, the erosive capability of conventional
glass.  For Plexiglas specifically, the predictive method should include
 fracture property transitions at high rates of loading (petalling to
Hertzian failure) and the partitioning of energy and erosive capability.
  Additionally, high rate properties, rate-induced glass-transition, and
 phase change effects are of specific interest in predicting behavior in
 polyurea and polyurethane polymers.      The predictive method will
support the analysis of a layered structure of highly rate-sensitive
materials with different thickness and component arrangements.  It
should be able to distinguish different thicknesses, placements, and
orientation (obliquity of the threat) of these materials.  It should
also incorporate capabilities for energy loss from momentum trapping
from failed components.  The predictive method should include
constitutive equations and Equation of State (EOS) in subroutines that
can be readily utilized in existing computer programs such as ABACUS,
AUTODYN, DYNA-S, LS-DYNA, and CTH or in Meshless and Particle methods.
    The predictive method should be capable of responding to threat
weapons of interest.  A sample weapon, a long-rod penetrator, will be
provided by ONR to support the development of a predictive capability in
 Phase I.  Later phases will include an Explosively Formed Projectile

maximum protection against these various threats, will be required.
PHASE I: Develop an analytical capability (i.e., subroutines) to
predict, with nanosecond time resolution, the response of layered

erosion\/comminution, wave propagation\/reflections, phase changes,
fracture transitions, and momentum trapping.  ONR will supply a long-rod
 penetrator for analytical purposes.    PHASE II: Transition the
analytical capability to an existing computer program such as ABACUS,

Perform blind design and optimization of targets to validate and verify
the analysis against test data and actual EFP and shape charge threats

Decision Making",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop innovative technologies that
blend rapid data processing capabilities of computers with intuitive
decision making skills of humans to improve human information throughput
 and decision making.    DESCRIPTION: Computers can process vast amounts
 of data in a short time but programming them to detect patterns is
extremely difficult. Humans, on the other hand, are adept at extracting
patterns from large amounts of data, yet are limited by the rate at
which they can apply these cognitive abilities to large amounts of
quickly changing information. Consequently, computers have low success
rates when tasked with detecting relevant and important information
embedded in complex data streams, while humans are unable to effectively
 process large amounts of data that are fast becoming a hallmark of
today"s decision-making environments. Compounding the problem,
traditional support technologies, like decision aids and visualization
tools, create an artificial barrier which plays to either the strengths
of computers or the strengths of their human operators, but not both.
  The process through which humans quickly make sense of partial,
incomplete, or rapidly presented information is known as intuition.
Intuitive decision-making processes are associated with rapid
recognition of patterns among incoming streams of information followed
by retrieval of associated knowledge without conscious attention. The
neural processes underlying intuition occur on a very rapid timescale
and can be captured by non-invasive imaging technologies. Combined with
cognitive and behavior-based measures of intuition, neural measures
should provide significant improvement in measurement accuracy. In
parallel to these discoveries, advances in bio-inspired adaptive data
analysis techniques like genetic algorithmic modeling are now being used
 to filter and sort information presented to humans. This is achieved by
 first generating"hunches"around likely human responses, then using
human behavioral responses to establish the plausibility of such hunches
 and finally, refining the information being presented through multiple
iterations of this process. Consequently, it should be possible to
augment the support of these bio-inspired data processing techniques by
integrating into them neuro-cognitive measures of intuition, enabling
humans to accurately and quickly detect meaningful information from a
mass of data.     The requested effort will augment current data
processing techniques by developing measures of intuition (e.g.,
cognitive, behavioral, and neural markers) that can be used to rapidly
identify the initial saliency and relevance of information, and then
refine the information presented through multiple iterations. This will
enable humans to rapidly analyze large amounts of information in complex
 information environments. This effort will develop a suite of
neuro-cognitive measures that can be reliably detected, integrate this
measurement suite into decision support and analysis technologies,
demonstrate increased amounts of information processed per unit time,
show reduced overall decision-making time, and quantify decision-making
effectiveness using signal detection theory.    PHASE I: Determine the
feasibility of developing a system that will blend rapid data-processing
 capabilities of computers with intuitive decision-making skills of
humans to improve human information throughput and decision making. The
performer will propose a prototype system and a preliminary design and
architecture, including descriptions of the following: proposed measures
 of intuition; appropriate sensor technologies for detecting these
measures; and, proposed method for linking these measures to decision
support and analysis technologies and the planned experimental paradigm
and use case. Modeling and simulation are encouraged to guide the
development of overall system design as well as to demonstrate the
potential effectiveness of the proposed system. A final report will be
generated, including system performance metrics and plans for Phase II.
Phase II plans should include key component technological milestones and
 plans for at least one operational test and evaluation event. Phase I
should also include the processing and submission of all required human
subject use protocols.    PHASE II: Develop a prototype system based on
the preliminary design from Phase I. All appropriate testing and a
critical design review will be performed to finalize the design. Phase
II deliverables will include: (1) a working prototype of the technology,
 (2) specification for its development, and (3) test data on its
performance collected in one or more operational settings.    PHASE III:
 Deploy the developed system for use in high operations tempo
environments, such as Command and Control, Maritime Operations Center or
 disaster management information centers.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL
POTENTIAL\/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: This technology will have broad
application in military as well as commercial settings in which large
quantities of information must be quickly and accurately analyzed for
effective decision making in high-risk and high-stress operational
settings. The military is reducing the number of personnel involved with
 weapons platforms and Command, Control, Communications, Computers,
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems while
increasing the total amount of information that these reduced crews must
 manipulate. Therefore, systems that help warfighters effectively
process this information are urgently needed. Similar trends are
occurring in commercial sectors, where fewer personnel are tasked with
processing ever-increasing amounts of information (e.g., air traffic
control, commercial shipping, manufacturing facilities, power plant
control systems, crisis management, and emergency management). For the
DoD, this technology will provide a means for ensuring that reduced
manpower does not result in reduced readiness and performance.
Commercially, this technology will provide a new capability to enable
fewer personnel to handle increasingly greater quantities of information
 across a wide range of domains.",

Wireless Ad Hoc Networks",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To develop a service that provides
distributed, secure data storage and sharing on a tactical wireless ad
hoc network.    DESCRIPTION:  The new generation of tactical radios and
networks will include remote unmanned sensors and radio nodes that
dynamically join and leave self forming networks and subnets. The
dissemination and storage of data across wireless links pose new
challenges on how these systems will access data and where the actual
data will reside. The Joint Tactical Radio System Program (JTRS)
encompasses a family of multi-functional Software Defined Radio (SDR)
communications systems that provide the next generation of voice, video
and data for the warfighter. Although JTRS is the platform of choice for
 this future, JTRS, and any tactical networking system, must be
supported by developments in networking and applications to meet future
warfighter data needs.    Specifically, while distributed data storage
and sharing is an important paradigm that has been embraced in many
computing contexts, it faces unique challenges in the military wireless
domain. Military tactical networks have unique characteristics that are
not easily addressed by available commercial solutions existing today.
Military networks are composed of mobile nodes with different, often
highly-specialized mission functions and capabilities, such as, sensing,
 fusion, planning, command and control, situational awareness, storage,
computation power, etc. Node mobility in a noisy, often-obstructed,
adversarial communications environment causes nodes to lose contact with
 the network frequently and unpredictably. The network can, and often
must, be partitioned into smaller sub-networks. Nodes can be lost due to
 loss of power or destruction, and they can be captured. Moreover, the
data in the network is highly dynamic, time sensitive, and critically,
it is prioritized relative to vital mission roles that vary by node and
over time.    Data must be reliably stored and accessed in military
networks under the above conditions. Solutions for data storage and
transmission in military mobile ad-hoc networks should address issues of
 i) performance: the warfighter should be able to access the information
 products needed for current mission functions efficiently and
selectively; ii) security: the data stored and transmitted over the
network should be secured from outside eavesdropping or loss of a node
to destruction, capture, or compromise by an enemy; and iii) resilience:
 the data should be highly available in the face of node loss,
interference and temporary loss of connectivity, with priority relative
to mission roles and objectives. Proposed research developments should
be compatible with planned future tactical platforms and components
(e.g., JTRS), but are expected to impact other situations where
highly-dynamic data is maintained in highly-disrupted networks. In the
commercial world, first responder and homeland defense communication
systems present similar characteristics and requirements.    PHASE I:
Develop initial concept design and model key elements of an enterprise
level strategy to distribute and store digital data collected from nodes
 in a tactical mobile ad-hoc networking topology. Develop an initial
concept design, identify and define key parameters necessary to store,
secure and access data in a system where nodes dynamically join and
leave the network in realistic, dynamic tactical scenarios.    PHASE II:
  In Phase II the contractor will finalize and validate the"distributed
data storage"design proposed in Phase I as well as construct and
demonstrate a working prototype with a minimum of 30 networking nodes,
showing resilience against lost nodes, network interference and
protection of data-at-rest. The contractor will also provide a detailed
plan for practical implementation in larger networks with potentially
hundreds of nodes.    PHASE III:  The transition opportunities within
the DoD will grow in parallel with the deployment and adoption of mobile
 ad hoc networks. A secure, distributed data, storage strategy will be
necessary in order to share information between network nodes in a
tactical environment.    PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL:
Commercial systems are moving to a"cloud storage"topology and DoD
systems will eventually make the same transition. Strategies developed
through this SBIR will leverage existing research and develop
a"distributed storage"strategy applicable for the first responder and
homeland defense communication systems.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop novel CubeSat payloads for
Naval space missions.    DESCRIPTION:  Nano-satellites are popular among
 universities and gaining momentum with commercial and government
organizations.  Standards based satellite buses and deployment
mechanisms, such as the CubeSat and Poly Pico-satellite Orbital Deployer
 (P-POD), have stimulated growth in the area.  Small satellites have
proven capable and cost effective in many areas traditionally dominated
by large satellites, however many challenges remain.    Beyond state of
the art research is needed to drastically reduce the size, weight and
power of payloads that have traditionally performed Naval space missions
 on much larger satellites.  Traditional Naval space missions include
narrowband communications (UHF Follow On, Mobile User Objective System),
 astrometry (Joint Milli-Arcsecond Pathfinder Survey), and ocean sensing
 (GEOdetic SATellite, GEOSAT Follow On).  Other missions of Naval
interest will also be considered.  Smaller, more cost effective
satellites will enable the Navy to continue vital space missions despite
 limited resources.    One important consideration in developing a new
CubeSat payload technology is mission life.  Most CubeSats are deployed
in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) where atmospheric drag is considerable.  Since
they generally do not carry propellant for station keeping, atmospheric
drag is often a mission life limiting factor.  The technology"s impact
on mission life must be weighed in the design process.    Novel
technologies will enable CubeSats to expand from university experiments
to operational missions.  It can be assumed that approximately two
thirds of the 3-U spacecraft size, weight and power will be used for
power management, attitude control, communications and other basic
spacecraft functions.  In general, proposed payloads should:    Meet the
 CubeSat Design Specifications    Fit within approximately 10x10x10 cm
and have 1.33 kg or less mass (fit within 1-U of a CubeSat)    Generate
less than 32 kilobits per second of data to be transferred to the ground

to provide enhanced cellular coverage in a variety of scenarios.  Beyond
 state of the art research is required to develop innovative new

secure, more efficient means to access systems performing recruiting,
personnel, travel and training functions.  An integrated approach is
needed to make maximum use of mobile, hand held technology while
maintaining information security.    DESCRIPTION: There are several
initiatives throughout DoD that focus on: portal consolidation, the
delivery and use of hand-held devices (e.g. tablets, mobile phones and
other PDAs) for mobile users, and a DoD enterprise marketplace for
widgets and web apps that can be rendered in i-frames for user
configurability with browsers.  This task is to investigate current DoD
and commercial products and initiatives for mobile users and develop a
security approach that supports integration of these devices for use
with business systems.  The security challenges (e.g. protection and
integrity of data in transit and at rest) associated with use of the
latest hand-held devices need to be investigated and a strategy for
resolution of these security concerns needs to be identified and proven.
  A light weight mobile device management approach is desired which
balances the use of server side platforms with a more containerized
solution.  The approach should support a cloud construct.    A common
user interface is needed to give users the flexibility to configure
according to their specific needs.  It needs to make use of widgets
developed to perform simple business functions and provide interfaces to
 all the appropriate business systems.  These widgets need to be
discoverable and able to be downloaded from a DoD repository.  In
addition to the challenge associated with data security, single sign-on
access control should be considered to simplify user access to needed
systems.     Mobile users of business systems also need the ability to
download and use simple web apps.  A standard approach and web apps need
 to be developed that provide functionality in disconnected,
intermittent, and limited communications conditions as well as safeguard
 the data (i.e. personally identifiable information) that is used by the
 particular business application.  Additionally, an approach for the use
 of these user-facing capabilities needs to be integrated with portal
consolidation strategies.    The ideal solution would provide for device
 diversity such that multiple OS systems can be supported as well as
various mobile platforms ranging from laptops, to tablet to smart
phones.  Securing and compliance verification should also be a
capability as well as software distribution.  Emerging techniques using

capabilities and initiatives, research and development of a strategy and
 security approach that allows for adaptation of these capabilities for
users of business systems, and recommendations for the products and
security that would be best suited for use with business systems and to
be piloted in Phase II.  The strategy, approach, and recommendations
need to ensure data security, access controls, performance, cost, and
effectiveness for the user within a mobile device management
architecture.  Architectural standards and constraints for these
capabilities should be defined as well as an improved mobile device
policy.    PHASE II: Piloting of the security approach for using these

devices, environment and need.  The pilots should include demonstration
of appropriate security for data and access controls using a

care associated and community acquired infections, but also from

which bacterial pathogens become resistant to antibiotics and more
virulent is through Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT), which allows for
genetic material transfer in the form of extrachromosomal plasmids from
one cell to another. This phenomenon is capable of transferring
resistance and\/or virulence genes to normally antibiotic susceptible
and avirulent bacteria. This creates a severe risk to front line

from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that contain
vancomycin resistance genes (in plasmid form) transferred from
vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).  Likewise, G9241, a benign form
of Bacillus cerus has acquired a B. anthracis virulence plasmid,
demonstrating transfer of virulence plasmids by HGT.       One way to
reverse the resistance of emerging or engineered bacteria created by HGT
 may be to specifically target the plasmids being transferred between
the cells, rather than using methods to directly kill the cells. This
idea is known as Plasmid Curing. Proposals are sought that will develop
novel plasmid curing therapeutics against plasmid encoded antibiotic
resistant and highly virulent pathogens. Studies working with ESKAPE
bacteria (Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter,
Pseudomonas, and bacteria that produce Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase
(ESBL) enzymes (Enterobacter and Escherichia coli)) are encouraged. The
therapeutic should be clinically relevant and therefore shown to be
non-toxic to humans and appropriate regulatory approval that would be
needed in bringing forth such a therapeutic in the drug development
pipeline should be considered.  Developing such a safe intervention may
help protect and provide appropriate treatment to our warfighters
against the dangerous pathogens they encounter in theatre.    PHASE I:
Demonstrate via in vitro experiments that the proposed therapeutic is
capable of removing any stable plasmid from a bacterial model
(identified by proposer). Therapeutic approaches that are effective
against both Gram (+) and Gram () will be prioritized.  Metrics should
demonstrate clearance and include clearance from two separate bacteria.
 If only partial clearance is achieved, state how this is still
appropriate as therapeutic treatment.  Propose an infectious in vivo
animal model capable of assessing the health of the microbiome after
treatment in addition to the efficacy of the treatment.  Criteria also
include providing details of the therapeutic; delivery method, proposed
dosage, storage and stability, etc.  Please note: Animal Subject
Research (ASR) and Human Subject Research (HSR) are NOT expected or
required for Phase I.    PHASE II:  Demonstrate the efficacy of the
therapeutic to cure two plasmid containing pathogens of interest
(identified by the proposer and relevant to the warfighter) that are
either antibiotic resistant or virulent in an in vivo animal model.
Demonstrate further the ability of the therapeutic to remove two or more
 plasmids from a pathogenic bacteria within the same animal model.
Therapeutic approaches that are effective against both Gram (+) and Gram
 () will be prioritized. Appropriate toxicology studies of the
therapeutic in an animal model to support an IND application should also
 be conducted.   The overall health of the microbiome after use of the
therapeutic in vivo should be described. Make sure to adhere to
biosafety and ethical guidelines.    PHASE III:  Successful or promising
 approaches identified in Phase II would continue the development
pathways for FDA approval and would support protecting the warfighter
against such microbial threats.   In addition, these therapeutics can be
 used as a medical countermeasure against any pathogen that may strike
the general population. Phase III and IND approval would lead to
appropriate clinical trials to gain FDA approval that may be funded
through additional government and\/or private funding sources.    This
SBIR Topic addresses the biomedical key technology area identified in
the Defense Technology Area Plan from February 2003. Specifically drug
resistant microbes are a significant current and future threat to US
military personnel deployed overseas. Military personnel suffer
significant life and limb threatening injuries and survive or
resuscitated only to face months of hospitalization and multiple
surgeries trying to combat extensively antibiotic resistant microbial
pathogens. In the current military medical system we encounter microbes
that are not responsive to any known antibiotics. In addition, naturally
 emergent or purposely engineered extensively antibiotic resistant
microbes pose a significant threat to military operational activities.
Most antibiotic resistance and many virulence genes are carried on
portable and easily transferable circles of DNA called plasmids that
live inside bacteria. Research and development under our topic will
identify innovative ways of"curing"plasmids, that is, to directly attack
 the plasmids instead of the bacteria. Although high risk, if successful
 this approach could open a new way of countering biological threats.",

 Using an Ensemble of Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) Centers in Diamond",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop compact magnetic field
imagers with nT\/Hz^1\/2 field sensitivity and sub-micron spatial
resolution using an optically-addressed ensemble of NV centers in
diamond.    DESCRIPTION: Highly sensitive magnetic field imaging systems
 are important tools in both military and civil sectors, finding
applications ranging from the detection of landmines and submarines to
the high-resolution imaging of sub-cellular phenomena. State-of-the-art
high-resolution magnetometers, Superconducting Quantum Interference
Devices (SQuIDs), are frequently found in medical devices for
magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They
can operate at the nT\/Hz^1\/2 level but are limited to micron
resolution, require cryogenic environments, and consume high power.
An attractive means of boosting the sensitivity and resolution of modern
 magnetometers in a room temperature, low power and rugged device, is to
 employ optically-addressed ensembles of NV centers in diamond. As well
as supplanting SQUIDS in medical applications, such magnetometers, with
sub-micron spatial resolution, could be used in the non-destructive
imaging of integrated circuits for the presence of malicious circuits.
  NV centers are atom-like defects in diamond that are highly sensitive
to magnetic fields despite being embedded in the solid state. In fact,
operation at the pT\/Hz^1\/2 level has been demonstrated and it is
expected that nm-scale resolution can be achieved [1-4].     This
approach is particularly exciting for biological and neuroscience
applications because it works under ambient conditions (room temperature
 and pressure) without significantly affecting the operation.
Furthermore, ensemble NV magnetometry offers a large field-of-view, a
robust, solid state system and low noise optical preparation and
detection. Because sensitivity scales as the square root of the number
of NV centers [5], ensembles are essential to achieving high-sensitivity
 over a broad area.        While impressive results have been obtained
in the laboratory, significant development is necessary to construct a
robust packaged imaging system with high-NV density and sufficiently
narrow inhomogeneous broadening, reduced background noise and efficient
collection efficiency. Methods of achieving the critical properties of a
 magnetic imager could include, but are not limited to, an improved
collection efficiency with solid-immersion lenses [6], side collection
schemes or anti-reflection coatings; reduced background noise with IR
absorption spectroscopy [2] in a low finesse resonant cavity or
obtaining high resolution with STED spectroscopy [7].    PHASE I:
Design a robust packaged magnetic field imaging system with an ensemble
of NV centers in diamond. Such a system should include high-grade
diamond with NV ensembles with long coherence times, a novel imaging
system with high-resolution, and optimized NV collection efficiency over
 a broad area. The chosen work must be compatible with an imaging system
 that has 1-10 nT\/Hz^1\/2 ac sensitivity and a 10-100 nm spatial
resolution. Exhibit the feasibility of the approach through a laboratory
 demonstration. Phase I deliverables will include a design review
including expected device performance and a report presenting the plans
for Phase II. Experimental data demonstrating feasibility of the
proposed device is favorable.    PHASE II:  Fabricate and test a
prototype device demonstrating the device performance outlined in Phase
I. The Transition Readiness Level to be reached is 5: Component and\/or
bread-board validation in relevant environment.    PHASE III:Compact
magnetic field imagers at the submicron level could have applications in
 the non-destructive imaging of integrated circuits for the presence of
malicious circuits and neuronal and brain imaging. Operation at room
temperature may lead to numerous applications in the imaging of living
tissue such as imaging the structure and composition of proteins and
molecules possibly in real time, informing the development of
pharmaceuticals. Innovations in Phases I and II will enable such devices
 to transition out of the laboratory and into fieldable devices.",

        "topic_name": "Minimally Invasive, Self-Collection of Large
Volume Biospecimens",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop advanced technologies that
can be self-operated by a patient or a minimally trained operator to
collect large volumes\/weights of a biospecimen for clinical use, such
as diagnostic and remote clinical trials, or for research applications
such as biomarker discovery\/validation.     The majority of diagnostic
tests and research assays require blood biospecimens that are
traditionally collected using phlebotomy techniques performed by trained
 personnel.  In limited resource areas, such as DoD deployment
locations, remote or impoverished geographic areas, or emergency
response locations, absence of blood sample collection by a trained
phlebotomist can be a significant limitation to clinical care.  Lancet
or finger stick blood collection methods are one solution to minimize
the need for these resources but suffer from low biofluid volumes that
statistically may not contain the biomarker(s) of interest at the
concentrations necessary for detection or clinical correlation.  See
reference #1 for examples of proteins in blood.  Solutions are sought
that enable the simple self-collection of sufficient biospecimen volumes
 or weights for the detection of low abundance diagnostic biomarkers.
All biospecimens are of interest and include blood, sweat, tears, etc.
Technologies developed should be minimally invasive, simple to operate,
and allow for remote self-collection of a sufficient sample volume
(e.g.&gt;100 microliters for blood) or weight, to allow for detection of
 a low-abundance panel of biomarkers at a reference laboratory or
point-of-care setting.  Potential users include minimally trained
individuals and medics in settings where phlebotomy is not available.
  If the technology is successfully developed, the capability to
statistically capture low abundance biomarkers by increasing the amount
of biospecimen collected in low resourced settings is anticipated to
widely improve clinical care and biomedical research by enabling remote
clinical trials, distributed remote access diagnostics, public health
surveillance and biomarker research.    DESCRIPTION: There is the need
for technologies capable of collecting patient biospecimens at
sufficient volumes or weights, in a manner that allows for statistically
 relevant clinical guidance after the sample has been processed and
analyzed. At the same time, enabling the capability to self-collect a
biospecimen could provide a means to more confidently diagnose or track
disease at its earliest stages, provide an ability to better expand
clinical trials into remote settings, and increase the diversity of
population cohorts needed for biomarker research. For example, blood
biospecimens are the biofluid of choice for most diagnostic applications
 but require trained phlebotomists to collect and process.
Simultaneously, there has been a push towards the miniaturization of
detection technologies (eg."lab-on-a-chip"and"nano-bio"technologies),
but there has been a disconnect between sample acquisition and
downstream analysis in a manner that allows for the detection of low
abundance analytes.     Aggressive low volume scaling through
finger-stick or lancet components affords clear advantages for sample
preparation, reagent usage, thermal load, manipulation, and reaction
kinetics, but there is nevertheless the challenge of dealing with"the
law of small numbers", or Poisson"s Distribution, which indicates that
for small biospecimen volumes there may be no targets available for
amplification or detection. In other words, diagnostic instruments may
be developed that are small, portable, and require only a few drops of
blood, but if the target analyte is not present in the small volume, the
 test could be susceptible to false negatives or not provide sufficient
statistical confidence to provide clinical guidance.     Additionally,
biospecimens other than blood, such as sweat, interstitial fluids, or
tears may have the potential to be a powerful natural repository of
clinically relevant biomarkers but there lack the technologies for
self-collection and concentration. Technologies that offer the
simplicity of a finger stick device (as an example) with the capability
to collect larger biospecimen volumes or weights would overcome a
diagnostic hurdle that limits widespread diagnostic testing outside of
traditional clinical settings such as a clinic or hospital. Therefore,
proposals are sought that address large volume (eg.&gt;100
microlitersfor blood) or weight biospecimen collection via a device that
 is simple to operate and minimally invasive. The design should consider
 minimally trained individuals and medics as potential users.  Proposers
 are encouraged to consider methods and technologies compatible with
clinical workflows, good laboratory practices (GLP), and good
manufacturing practice (GMP) procedures.    PHASE I: Demonstrate
feasibility of methods or technologies for large volume or weight
collection. Proposers must address both the volume\/weight of
biospecimen collected, as well as address how device operation is
conducted under conditions of minimal invasiveness and ease-of-use.
Proposers should aim to collect as large a volume or weight as possible
(eg. at least 100 microliters for blood) while retaining the capability
for operation by a minimally trained user.     Collection devices may be
 designed to hold the collected biospecimen within the device or to
dispense the biospecimen into an instrument or alternate storage device.
 Proposers should demonstrate initial designs and collection
volumes\/weights, and project Phase II collection volume\/weight
capabilities.     Proposals that demonstrate universal compatibility for
 downstream analysis under a wide dynamic range of analytes are
preferred. Of interest are quantitative metrics measured with a variety
of protein, nucleic acid, metabolic and\/or other analytes relevant to
human biology. Phase I efforts should justify the applicability to
settings such as home use, and consideration of FDA regulations is
encouraged.    PHASE II: Phase II efforts should quantify collected
biospecimen volume\/weight and address reproducibility of the collection
 volume\/weight with different prototypes under similar and different
conditions. Detection of a panel of well-characterized, low abundance
biomarkers should be demonstrated from collected samples using standard
laboratory practices. Of interest are quantitative metrics measured with
 a variety of protein, nucleic acid, metabolite and\/or other analytes
relevant to human biology.     Phase II efforts should evaluate the
device effectiveness and reproducibility when operated by untrained
users. Additional interests include demonstrations that the proposed
technology is developed to include standardization\/normalization of the
 biospecimen to reference analyte concentrations across collections,
with sensitivities that can address sample variability.
Manufacturing designs and costs should be considered for all components
of the device. Compatibility of the collection device with downstream
biospecimen storage devices and\/or analysis technologies should be
considered. Device potential for FDA clearance as a blood collection
device for home use or physician office settings should be described.
 PHASE III: The technology to be developed should enable blood
collection outside of a major clinical facility and therefore could have
 significant impact on the clinical diagnostic market. There is a
significant commercial market for medical diagnostics and home-use
physician-office based diagnostic testing is a growing element of this
market. The developed technology would potentially allow collection of
sufficient sample in such settings, as well as enable clinically valid
diagnostic testing and biomarker research. Potential commercial
partnerships\/customers include major diagnostics companies and life
sciences research technology companies.    The technology to be
developed is critical for DoD, as many medics have minimal training.
Development of a FDA-approved collection device could enable use of
newly developed diagnostic tests in remote\/deployment settings as well
as expand the military capabilities to perform more effective clinical
trials of new therapeutics and diagnostics in remote settings or expand
capabilities to detect and track emerging disease. Potential transition
customers include Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Air Force
Surgeon General, Military Health System - Defense Medical Research and
Development Program (MHS DMRDP), Military Infectious Diseases Research
Program (MIDRP), and the commercial sector.",

        "topic_name": "Blending Skills Training and STEM Education:
Game-Based First-Responder Application",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a mobile application that
uses innovative game-based strategies and visualization techniques to
teach medical first-responder skills combined with intelligent tutoring
systems to teach underlying STEM principles. Game design, architecture,
and research approach should allow for the optimization of pedagogical
approaches based on performance of the individual learner and across a
large population of users.    DESCRIPTION: Computer-based medical
training applications are usually developed to mimic skill sets that
would normally require a live patient or manikin rather than considering
 what a computer provides that these methods do not.  Thus, medical
simulations have focused heavily on training specific skills and
techniques as a surrogate to other modes of training.  However, computer
 game-based technologies provide the opportunity to combine skills
training with generalizeable educational principles.  For example,
instead of simply providing instruction on where to apply a tourniquet, a
 computer-based system can reinforce the lesson with demonstrations and
discussion of the underlying physiology of the circulatory system.
Thus, a student may learn why wounds in slightly different locations
respond differently or why applying pressure in certain conditions is
essential. The game-based approach also allows for integrating the
lessons into dramatic and engaging scenarios.      Combining skills
training with the underlying STEM principles from biology\/physiology
should more readily allow for the generalization of the skills to novel
situations.  This tool is envisioned for both medical training and in
basic civilian education science classes.  The goal is to create a
game-based application on mobile platforms to teach first responder
principles that integrates intelligent tutoring systems to not only
teach basic skills, but answer the underlying questions of why a student
 should or should not have responded the way they did.  Using this
application, students should learn BOTH basic skills and also basic
principles of human physiology.  Thus, this can be used as a classroom
resource for science education as well as a resource to teach medical
skills for first responders.     The underlying architecture should
allow for the analysis and optimization of the software to both the
individual user and across the entire population of users.  We are not
seeking standard computer-based learning systems, but game-based
interactive systems that are engaging and challenging to the user.
Design and development should be to professional game standards and the
proposed game concepts should be compelling, innovative, and designed to
 motivate users for continued interactions.  Innovative approaches for
visualization and interaction with these different types of information
are required.           The system should educate, train, and assess the
 student"s knowledge.  The patient models should respond accurately and
be based on underlying physiology models that respond appropriately to
both injury and treatment.  The simulation should include a case editing
 tool that instructors and students can use to customize injury
scenarios.   The system should be developed in such a way to allow
customization of options for basic first responders with limited
resources to more advanced options for Corpsmen\/Medics\/EMTs.
Proposals must reflect team expertise in medical training (military and
civilian), education, and game production.  Teams that do not reflect a
balance between these skill sets will not be considered.  Proposals
should clearly outline proposed development tools, design standards,
educational approaches, and validation strategies.  Proposals must also
discuss details of transition strategy and market opportunities.
PHASE I:  Identify the exact training\/education goals of the prototype
system and metrics for success.  Develop the conceptual design and
framework for the proposed system.  At a minimum, provide extensive
storyboards outlining gameplay, user interface, and user interactions.
Develop detailed strategies for using this application for medical
training and in the classroom.  In preparation for Phase II, develop a
robust methodology with clear metrics for assessing usability, user
acceptance, and effectiveness of the application. It is important to
note that there will be no human use testing in Phase I.    PHASE II:
Develop, demonstrate, and validate an initial prototype on mobile-based
software platforms that can be used in a variety of
educational\/military environments. The required deliverable for Phase
II will include: the prototype system, demonstration and testing of the
prototype system, and a Final Report. The Final Report will include (1) a
 detailed design of the prototype mobile, game-based application(s) tool
 sets, (2) the experimental results from such toolsets, and (3) a plan
for Phase III.    PHASE III: Delivery of a complete game-based mobile
application with validated pedagogical efficacy that is engaging and
ready for integration into identified learning environments.  Scenarios
should be applicable to civilian first-responder training.  Application
should be available for licensing or download.    Delivery of a complete
 game-based mobile application (IOS\/Android) with validated pedagogical
 efficacy that is engaging and ready for integration into identified
learning environments.  Scenarios should be applicable to
first-responder scenarios encountered by military personnel.",

Which Laser Diode Fails",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Improve the reliability\/lifetime and
 increase power and performance of high power laser diodes (LD).
DESCRIPTION: There is a compelling need for substantially increasing the
 power and brightness of LD optical-pumps in the 9xx nm spectral range
for scaling single-mode narrow-line fiber lasers to high power for DoD
high energy laser (HEL) applications. The power and brightness of
state-of-the-art LDs are severely limited by catastrophic optical-damage
 (COD) at the front facet. COD severely limits the power\/bar that could
 be attained and hence a larger number of LD bars are required for a
given LD pump power. The larger number of bars increases system
complexity and decreases efficiency of the high power laser system.  In
addition it results in an increase in size, weight and cost of the laser
 system.      The focus of this SBIR is to significantly improve the
reliability of high-power semiconductor LDs so they can be reliably
operated at 6-7X higher power density per bar than the present
state-of-the-art. Specifically, state-of-the-art 980nm, 20 percent
fill-factor, 10mm wide bars operate at approximately 70W.   Achieving
this goal of 400-500W\/bar may directly impact DARPA"s high-power fiber
lasers such as Revolution in Fiber Lasers RIFL by increasing the
specific power of laser diodes pumps from the present 1kW\/kg to
6-7kW\/kg.  Since LD pumps contribute about 50% of the cost and weight
of the high power laser system, increasing the specific power (kW\/kg)
will have a significant impact on the size of the high energy laser
system.  In addition, the cost of the laser diode pumps is inversely
proportional to the power\/bar and increase of 6-7x in power that could
be obtained from a bar decreases the cost by a similar factor.     The
weight and cost of LD pumps is estimated to be approximately 50% of the
laser system so decreasing them by 6X will decrease the all-important
weight and cost of the HEL by 40%. This technology will also provide
similar benefits to the HEL solid-state lasers.    PHASE I:   Determine
the technical feasibility of the growth of a single-crystal passivation
layer on the (110) facet of a 9xx laser diode formed at low temperature
and in ultra-high vacuum.  Current passivation techniques are either
amorphous, resulting in significant residual surface state density
within the bandgap, or require high temperature growth which degrades
the Ohmic contacts.  Low temperature growth (",

        "topic_name": "Ultra-Bright Diode Laser Emitters for Pumping
High-Power Fiber Amplifiers",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate a wavelength-stabilized
diode laser system for pumping high-power fiber laser amplifiers
consisting of diode laser emitters that are at least ten times brighter
than conventional broad-stripe emitters.    DESCRIPTION: High average
and peak power fiber lasers and amplifiers offer an attractive
combination of high efficiency, near diffraction-limited beam quality,
low phase noise, and reliable operation.  They have found wide use in
industrial and scientific applications ranging from cutting and welding
to gravitational wave detection, and their small size makes them
promising candidates for defense applications such as laser-based
weapons and long-range lidar on airborne platforms.  Fiber laser and
amplifier systems can also be scaled to even higher power using coherent
 or spectral beam combining [1], but two competing nonlinear processes
limit the power available from a single continuous-wave fiber amplifier
and, by extension, the power from a beam-combined system.        To
achieve good efficiency, both coherent and spectral beam combining
require the fiber lasers and amplifiers to have a narrow spectral
bandwidth, but these narrow-band systems are very susceptible at high
powers to stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), which is a nonlinear
process that can scatter significant power backwards into the laser
system.  Several approaches have been used to suppress SBS, but the most
 common is to utilize short fibers with large cores to reduce the
interaction length and lower the Brillouin gain [2].      Recently, a
new modal instability has been identified that drastically reduces the
output beam quality and limits the useful power from high-power
beam-combinable amplifiers [3]. Experimental data show that a
significant amount of signal power is coupled into higher-order optical
modes of the fiber core and\/or cladding when the average amplifier
power exceeds a threshold on the order of 1 kW.  Theoretical
investigations into the mode-coupling mechanism and ways to mitigate it
are not yet conclusive [4]. Smaller cores with fewer modes would reduce
this instability but at the expense of higher Brillouin gain.      One
approach to reducing both SBS and modal instabilities is to use
extremely short fibers with narrow cores that guide only a few modes, at
 most.  However, short double-clad fibers require extremely bright pump
lasers that are spectrally narrowed and locked to match the gain
fiber&amp;#39;s absorption peak in order to efficiently absorb the pump
light.    Currently, state-of-the-art fiber-coupled diode pump lasers
are limited to an ex-fiber brightness of ~25 MW\/cm2sr, corresponding to
 100 W from a fiber with a 105-&amp;micro;m core and 0.12 NA (numerical
aperture) without wavelength stabilization [5], but this fiber-coupled
spatial brightness is significantly lower than the record of 1 GW\/cm2sr
 for a single diode laser [6,7].      This SBIR topic seeks innovative
approaches to realizing a high-power wavelength-stabilized fiber-coupled
 diode laser system that employs extremely bright emitters to achieve an
 ex-fiber brightness&gt;100 MW\/cm2sr.  The resulting pump laser module
could be transitioned to multiple government-funded high-power laser
programs or commercialized as a part of systems targeting industrial
laser cutting applications.    PHASE I:  Demonstrate a single diode
laser operating at ~976 nm with output power&gt;10 W, spatial
brightness&gt;1 GW\/cm2sr, and electrical-to-optical efficiency&gt;52%.
 All three performance metrics should be achieved simultaneously on a
single device.  Develop a concept to package several of these emitters
into a single wavelength-stabilized module that can achieve the Phase II
 performance metrics.    PHASE II:  Construct and demonstrate a
prototype laser system suitable for pumping high-power fiber lasers
based on the Phase I module concept and diode emitters. The key
performance goals are: 1) fiber-coupled power&gt;500 W continuous-wave,
2) ex-fiber spatial brightness&gt;100 MW\/cm2sr, 3)&gt;42% ex-fiber

New Communications Concepts",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop detailed foliage propagation
models applicable to multiple environments that will support creation
and analysis of new communications concepts that greatly exceed the
operational performance of current systems in these environments.
DESCRIPTION: The need for propagation models that extend beyond free
space and urban environments into foliage-rich environments is
well-known. The rising need for communications in forests, jungles and
triple canopy environments shows the importance of characterizing these
RF environments. This will allow for real-time situational awareness,
sensor and command and control data throughout the entire battle space.
Traditional communications through dense foliage and vegetations is
challenged by severe multipath and attenuation thereby limiting the
warfighter"s access to critical data. There is little to no data on RF
propagation across the entire frequency spectrum through the various
foliage elements and current models, such as FOREST, typically view
foliage environments as a uniform dielecteric slab and are limited by
the assumptions that they treat forests as reasonably uniform, the floor
 as absorptive, and only address frequencies up to approximately 1 GHz.
 A model is needed that can address the entire range of spectum,
including current military radio systems, new 4G wireless technologies,
millimeter wave communications (30-300 GHz), and can be equally applied
to forest and jungles that are assumed to be non-uniform.  A more
thorough understanding of how RF signals act in these areas will allow
for a communications concept to be developed that will overcome these
challenges and limitations. The model will be combinable with other RF
models to create a single, comprehensive RF propagation model.    PHASE

and provide the framework for a comprehensive foliage propagation model.
 The study should analyze the effects of multipath, attenuation and
dispersion and be capable of statistical characterizations of system
performance. It should analyze current limited models to decide if these
 models can be leveraged to support the new model and investigate other
technologies that may provide indirect information that could be
utilized or adapted such as information from LandSat imagery or foliage
penetrating radars. This analysis will include RF properties from
multiple types of foliage, trees and vegetation to provide a basis for
the study.  Phase I should result in the framework for a comprehensive
foliage propagation model in Phase II.    PHASE II:  Develop a
comprehensive foliage model to accurately predict RF propagation through
 multiple types and densities of vegetation. The model will be validated
 and tested using government provided emperical data as well as
real-world measurements obtained from field testing in various
enviornments across the full spectrum of frequencies.  The model will
then be used to support a separate research and development program of
new communications technologies and systems with performance
capabilities beyond current systems operating within these environments,
 e.g. increased communications range, accuracy, capacity, bandwidth and
reduced equipment size, weight and power. Phase II will result in a
comprehensive, working foliage penetration model that can be applied to
current and future communications systems in these type environments.
The technology readiness level at the end of this phase will be a
minimum Level 6.    PHASE III:  The system should be applicable to
commercial and homeland security operations in dense, foliage-rich
environments.  A military prototype communications system, based on the
results found from the Phase II foliage propagation model, should be
designed, field tested and verified.  Potential interested military
organizations include the Defense Spectrum Organization (DSO) and
CERDEC"s Space&amp;Terrestrial Communications Directorate, specifically
the Antennas&amp;Spectrum Analysis Division.",

electrical energy storage at high charge and discharge rates, high cycle

transient in nature and effective storage of megawatt scale power is a
critical technology to enable forward operating base (FOB) level power
management. Currently available batteries are not effective solutions
with inadequate large scale energy storage, rapid recharge\/discharge
capabilities, and cycle life.  These deficiencies preclude their use for
 vehicle portable large scale storage and limit the utility of renewable
 power sources which are subject to large fluctuations. An effective
solution has the potential to impact a variety of applications, such as
load leveling of power grids to providing uninterruptible backup power,
and reduce the logistical burden associated with fuel for power
generation at critical DoD bases and FOBs.  In addition, large scale
power storage technology will enable the use of renewable power
generation including photovoltaics or wind power.  This SBIR topic seeks
 new high-performance energy storage solutions that will reduce fuel
dependence for power generation at FOBs.    PHASE I:  Prepare a

lifetime&gt;1,000 cycles,&gt;100 Wh\/kg,&gt;0.3 kWh\/l,&gt;1 MW charge

Awareness",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate a cognitive-centric
User-Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) capability that allows
multi-national teams to maintain a common understanding of the space
situation.    DESCRIPTION:   This effort will apply cognitive science
technology to develop human-system interfaces for a multi-national space
 operations center with a focus on Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance (ISR).  This area is critical to space situational
awareness (SSA) and a focus area for the Air Force, DARPA, and overall
national security.    The U.S.-centric Joint Space Operations Center
(JSpOC) is quickly becoming a multi-national Coalition Space Operations
Center (CSpOC).  These multinational forces do not always have access to
 the same information and yet they need a common situational
understanding to make informed joint decisions.  Differences in
cultures, security levels, collaboration preferences, tactical
priorities, and information accessibility pose unique cognitive science
challenges for human-system interface design.  Applying innovative
cognitive science solutions to the problem  such as
work-centered\/sensemaking support and visual analytics  could
positively impact routine operations and dramatically impact operations
during contingencies when human-to-human coordination needs to happen
quickly.    Effective coordination among multi-national forces requires
continuous and rapid information sharing, group problem solving,
error-checking, and progress monitoring. All of these and possibly other
 capabilities are needed to support independent and interdependent tasks
 for plans, operations, intelligence, and communication. These team
members will need a decision-centric environment supporting work flows
and processes. Additionally, team members separated by security levels
and\/or geography will need an extension of the UDOP concept for their
collaborative work environment where they can generate shared
understanding and synchronize collective Command and Control (C2) and
ISR activities and missions.    Innovative technology is needed to
identify and navigate multi-national teams through relevant
human-centric issues allowing effective, accurate, and timely
collaboration and information sharing. This tool will provide the
underpinnings of multi-national force collaboration strategies allowing
teams the ability to provide C2 information to Allied Force commanders. A
 few issues of concern might be: (1) human-computer interface
differences, (2) multi-level security, (3) cultural differences, (4)
language and terminology, (5) working and learning environment
differences and preferences, and (6) command structure differences and
preferences.    Ultimately what needs to be defined and navigated
through is the difference between JSpOC and CSpOC working environments
for improved SSA. This effort will confront multi-national issues for
the JSpOC Mission System (JMS) before the system, and in particular the
UDOP, become too big to incorporate changes.    PHASE I: Design a
concept for a human-computer interface that supports multi-national
space situational awareness with a focus on ISR. Other areas are also
performed jointly  including Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT),
Satellite Communication, Missile Warning, and Environmental Monitoring
but these would be considered above and beyond the scope of this effort.
  The end product of this phase will include a technical report that
outlines the approach for Phase II and the completed system. The concept
 description will need to address how the technology will integrate with
 or augment existing capabilities used in space operations centers.
PHASE II: Develop, demonstrate and validate the human-system interface
software in a relevant environment that closely corresponds to an actual
 multi-national space operations center. By successfully demonstrating
in a relevant environment, the software should obtain a Technology
Readiness Level of 5.    PHASE III: With the expanding global satellite
services industry, multi-national space operations are not unique to the
 military. This capability will also be valuable to the commercial space
 industries that need to coordinate operations across multi-national
companies. The software will interface with many other space monitoring
and information tools, yet maintain a unified look and feel for the
user. In addition to the software, the small business could be in a good
 position to act as a consultant for any enterprise interested in
multi-national space operations.",

Identification of Satellites",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Define and demonstrate approaches to
establish and maintain rapid and reliable positive object identification
 of individual satellites in orbit through sparse but regular data
collection.    DESCRIPTION: Current methodologies supporting the
maintenance of the satellite catalog based upon information derived from
 the Space Surveillance Network are inadequate to enable a proactive
approach to certain issues relevant to Space Situational Awareness
(SSA).  Among the challenges for SSA is the capability to maintain
active custody of individual satellites.  Some objects are frequently
lost and sometimes serendipitously reacquired without recognition of its
 previous catalog existence unless manpower-intensive analysis
intervenes to uncover the situation for some cases.  Maintaining custody
 of a large number of satellites is a leap in capability requiring
innovative solutions that are amenable to automation in order to be
feasible for implementation.        The challenge of maintaining custody
 is magnified in certain crowded regions of space by the sheer number of
 objects present, the fact that most active satellites perform periodic
but unannounced maneuvers for orbit and\/or attitude corrections,
dynamical models are approximate, and a certain number of faint objects
are marginally detectable thus forming a sort of background clutter.
Active custody encompasses the indication for when objects are missing,
action to identify and search likely regions for reacquisition, and
positive identification of a reacquired object as the previously missing
 object.  Timeliness and accuracy in the identification of reacquired
objects are key performance metrics.        Positive identification of
satellites is linked to defining signatures that are predictable and
uniquely indicating the presence of some feature(s) of an object,
manifesting from its physical and\/or operational attributes.  For
objects in space, signatures may stem from any observable phenomenology
that may be remotely sensed from ground-based or space-based
instrumentation.      A collection of appropriately selected signatures
may be sufficient to unambiguously identify individual satellites, even
among those of common manufacturers and of similar bus types.  Combining
 signature information with orbital dynamics modeling may increase
confidence in the identification of reacquired objects.    PHASE I:
Develop an initial concept design and model key elements for a feasible
approach to establish and maintain positive identification of individual
 satellites, including active payloads and tumbling objects.  Phase I
deliverables will include a detailed report of the chosen approach.
PHASE II:  Develop, demonstrate, and validate through high simulation
and\/or real data if suitable test cases are available the approach
proposed in Phase I.  Develop a detailed mathematical or parametric
relationship between available observation data and the probability of
maintaining custody.  Initial target TRL at beginning of Phase II effort
 is 2, and target TRL at conclusion of Phase II is 5.  Required Phase II
 deliverables will include documented algorithms, detailed reports of
validation efforts and findings, and software implementations used to
demonstrate and validate the approach.    PHASE III:  Most likely path
for transition of this effort is through the Joint Space Operations
Center (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS) with the end user being the JSpOC.
Additional efforts may be required to mature the technology to TRL 6.
Potential commercial applications include establishing attribution for
radio frequency interference or any other actions that may result in
loss of service to the detriment of a payload operator.",

substrates for radiation hard devices",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Investigate and develop a method for
 cost-effective growth of semi-insulating bulk GaN crystals suitable for
 use as substrates for radiation-hard electronics and detectors
DESCRIPTION:  Nuclear events present major challenges to the continuous,
 reliable operation of electronics and detectors.  A variety of means
have been developed to radiation-harden electronics technology,
including Radiation Hardening By Design (RHBD), Radiation Hard By
Process (RHBP), and the use of wide band-gap semiconductor materials
such as GaN and SiC.  The former approaches have generally focused on
novel uses of otherwise industry-standard processing based on silicon,
and therefore are subject to all the limitations inherent to silicon.
For example, high frequency amplifiers are generally fabricated on
materials such as GaAs or InP that have greatly improved performance
characteristics compared to silicon, and devices fabricated on GaN or
SiC are being developed as well.    The ideal solution for many classes
of devices is to use radiation-hard architectures with a material system
 that is inherently radiation hard.  The best such system appears to be
gallium nitride, particularly for devices requiring high frequency
operation such as microwave and millimeter wave amplifiers.  Indeed, a
radiation hard, Schottky-contact-free, GaN-based MOS HEMT has been
reported recently [1].  However, like most GaN-based devices being
manufactured today, these devices relied on GaN layers grown
heteroepitaxially on a non-GaN substrate.   It is well known that such
layers are highly defective, with threading dislocation densities in the
 range of 108  1010 cm-2, and such dislocations have been shown to
markedly degrade the leakage current in HEMT structures [2].
Semi-insulating bulk GaN substrates, grown by hydride vapor phase
epitaxy, meeting many of the property requirements for high-performance
electronics have been reported [3].  However, the dislocation density of
 the HVPE substrates remains 10-100 higher than desirable for many
electronic and detector applications.  In addition, cost is a major
challenge:  commercially-available 2"diameter bulk GaN substrates
typically cost $2000-5000, and 4"and 6"substrates are disproportionately
 more expensive still and are not yet being manufactured in the U.S.
Native substrates fabricated from bulk single crystals are foundational
to virtually all electronics technologies, and the relative immaturity
and high cost of bulk GaN crystal technology is a significant impediment
 to device development.  Semi-insulating bulk GaN substrates, with a
diameter of at least 100 mm, a room-temperature resistivity of at least
109&amp;#61527;-cm, a threading dislocation density below 105 cm-2, and a
 cost below $500, would greatly improve the nation"s ability to develop
next-generation, radiation hard electronics and detectors.  Successful
proposers need to demonstrate a clear path to achieving each of these
objectives.    PHASE I:  Develop a model that demonstrates that the
proposed approach can meet the target cost of $500 for a 100 mm wafer.
Synthesize proof-of-concept semi-insulating GaN crystals with a
room-temperature resistivity of at least 109&amp;#61527;-cm and a
threading dislocation density below 105 cm-2.  Demonstrate reaction
conditions that, upon scale up, would enable achieving the cost target.
   PHASE II:  Develop a process to implement the proposed improved GaN
crystal growth technology, including all necessary ancillary capability.
  Demonstrate routine capability to synthesize 2"diameter GaN crystals
meeting the property metrics under process conditions that can be scaled
 to meet the cost target.    PHASE III \/ DUAL USE COMMERCIALIZATION:
Military applications will include high power RF amplifiers with high
performance and excellent radiation hardness.  Commercial applications
will include RF amplifiers for cell phone base stations and for high
voltage light emitting diodes.      OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:  The
commercial unavailability of electronic device grade native GaN
substrates is an extreme constraint on the large-scale development and
implementation of this wide band-gap, high performance, and radiation
hard technology.  This SBIR has the prospect of leading to an important
breakthrough.",

 Polymer Layer(s) with Very High Thermal Conductivity",
        "description": "DESCRIPTION:  With advances in
Microelctromechanical systems (MEMs) technologies, miniaturized smart
munitions have been used in missiles as well as ordnance. The extremely
small circuit board assembly (CBA) in these systems is one of the most
critical parts of this new generation of smart munitions.  However,
limitations are being achieved due to the thermal heat budget of the
MEMS components.  These problems are evident as two types of thermal
management issues related to the CBA reliability: (1) CBA thermal
management during long-term storage, up-to 15-20 years, sometimes under
un-controlled harsh and extreme bunker environments.  (2). CBA thermal
management during projectile launch  operation, when the board is
functional.    In the last four years, DARPA-Microsystems Technology
Office has been investigating"Thermal Ground Plane"(TGP) research
efforts. An important feature of the DARPA intended TGP technology is to
 be able to insert this new material(s) easily into existing DoD systems
 without redesign of those systems.  This will provide new engineering
heat transfer margins that can be taken up by increasing the power use
of the system, reducing the operating temperature of the electronic
devices, and reducing the size of the other components of the thermal
management system.  In addition, the availability of TGPs will allow
future DoD electronic system designs to be more aggressive in increases
of weapon density, allow for larger power consumption, significantly
larger electromagnetic radiation output, and provide greater performance
 than is presently allowed (Ref 1).    The DTRA is seeking proposals to
develop flexible\/formable polymer layer(s) to enhance Smart Weapons \/
Sensor Systems operational survivability.  The proposed solution needs
to satisfy the following requirements to include: 1) formable polymer
layers capable of encapsulating 4"x 8"CBAs with a tight fit for all
critical components regardless of shape; 2) formable polymer layer
thermal conductivity at less greater than 400 W\/m-K (copper thermal
conductivity) preferably 800 W\/m-K or better; 3) polymer layers will
provide EMI protection, attenuation and infiltration; 4) polymer layer
will have moisture barrier capabilities; 5) polymer layers need to be
compatible with FR4 (fiberglass reinforced printed wiring board
material) coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and will survive a
temperature cycling range (-50 C to 70 C); 6) the upper limit of the
polymer layer(s) thickness shall be 0.150 cm; 7) polymer layers will not
 degrade shock\/vibration loads of the existing smart munitions subject
to 25K g-force over less than 1 msec duration due to hard target impact
(ref. 2).    PHASE I:  Proof of concept and development of
flexible\/formable polymer layer(s) with the required thermal
conductivity; EMI shielding and water barrier capabilities. The polymer
layer should be capable of encapsulating the complete CBA.    PHASE II:
 Develop proposed solutions with at least two existing smart munitions
applications from AFRL including all necessary experimental test
verifications. Present a plan for additional DoD and commercial
(dual-use) applications.    PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  To be
determined based on Phase II progress reports. Based on the research
carried out during Phase II, the commercial preparation phase will
include a tool made after product sample environmental, shock and
vibration, thermal and EMC testing. Test results will provide data
needed to finalize material selection, process adjustments and assembly
techniques.     UNIQUENESS OF TOPIC:  Advances in this work are
necessary to enhance weapon survivability for counter weapons of mass

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop unique CBRN-specific
transformational materials that augment our capabilities to detect
individuals and\/or materials associated with the development,
manufacture, or proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).
 DESCRIPTION:  DTRA is exploring innovative technologies for CWMD by
developing transformational materials to support Intelligence,
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) of individuals or materials
associated with CBRN weapons technologies and\/or products. These
technologies will enhance our ability to associate individuals or
material with CBRN weapons programs and support DTRA\/SCC-WMD"s priority
 of reinforcing the COCOMS and the Department of Homeland Defense
capability to rapidly and efficiently respond to WMD threats. DTRA has
significant interest in materials that physically transform upon
exposure to CBRN agents, isotopes, and their precursors. For example:
chemical detection technologies would produce identifiable signatures
when exposed to GB, GD, VX, HD or simulants such as DMMP, DIMP, DCH,
CEPS and TDG; biological detection technologies would produce
identifiable signatures when exposed to anthrax spores; and
radiological-nuclear detection technologies would produce identifiable
signatures when exposed to radiation from special nuclear materials or
medical isotopes, such as Cs-137 or Co-60. Preferably, these materials
will be optically covert to the unaided eye before and after
transformation, or tailored into a covert key corresponding to a
specific library. Ideal solutions would allow an operator to use a
currently available imaging\/targeting system with\/without filters to
observe the material after transformation. Ideal solutions would be
discernible under both day and night illumination. Emphasis should be
placed on signal to noise characteristics to enhance distinguishing a
transformational material from its surrounding background. An ideal
material would have the potential for the transformational signal to
degrade after operationally relevant timeframes. Potential applications
for these materials include incorporation into fibers\/clothing,
solvents, ink, paint, aerosol cans, appliques, construction materials
(concrete, wood, steel, asphalt), and other innovative materials.
PHASE I:  Develop and demonstrate in a laboratory environment,
transformational materials that possess a detectable signature change
when exposed to CBRN agents, simulants, or isotopes, such as GB, GD, VX,
 HD, anthrax spores, Cs-137, and\/or Co-60.           PHASE II:  Develop
 transformation materials and the initial definition of production
process controls needed for reliable device performance, as well as
quantification of the prototype material sensitivity, specificity, and
stability when exposed to CBRN agents or simulants. Characterize and
optimize transformational materials for environmental conditions.
Conduct a demonstration of a standoff (200 meter) detection capability
in an operationally relevant environment.      PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS:  Phase III efforts include transition of this technology
and implementation into a variety of uses. Properly designed
transformational material would satisfy current civilian safety needs of
 labor workers in the chemical, biological, or nuclear industry. For
example, a worker"s clothing could be treated with a material that
transforms upon exposure. At the end of the worker"s shift, their
clothing could be inspected under black light or Infrared IR to
determine exposure levels. Civilian infrastructure components could use
smart materials embedded into construction materials (concrete, wood,
steel, asphalt) to enhance or induce naturally occurring transformation.
 An example: placing embedded transformational materials in asphalt,
capturing natural earth (background) radiation or sunlight during the
day and transforming with an associated optical property at night; this
ultimately improves roadway visibility. Civilian law enforcement could
also use transformational materials by adding\/infusing to paint or home
 products, revealing a stand-off signature of illicit manufacturing labs
 which threaten homeland security. CBRN-specific transformational
materials offer the ability to detect threats before incidents occur and
 have unique applications with respect to civil sector. This WMD ISR
topic supports TTL Program technology requirements and fosters current
efforts to expand innovation into C-WMD material applications.",

        "topic_name": "Soil-Structure Interaction (SSI) Effects for
Fully and Partially Buried Structures",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop simplified models to
approximate soil effects for fully and partially buried structures.
DESCRIPTION:  Computing the response caused by munitions on fully
and\/or partially buried structures often necessitates using very large
finite element (FE) models that include the soil in the structure"s
vicinity.  This is necessary in order to achieve sufficiently accurate
results which require approximations for SSI effects, even in the cases
of relatively simple structures.  Such FE models have been long used in
nuclear and conventional weapons effects analyses for buried structures.
  Soil springs were used to approximate the SSI phenomena and reduce the
 size of the analytic model.  However, there are some problems such as:
 (1) the soil spring characterization is very dependent upon loading
magnitude and frequency, but there is insufficient data and lack of a
methodology by which to adequately define this dependency; (2) the need
for developing an STF to define the forces hitting the structure based
on the motions in the soil that the effects of ground shock and forces
imparted to the structure; (3) the influence of arching on the load
transfer through the soil, which is related to the relative stiffness of
 the soil and structure; etc.    Having a simplified soil structure
model that appropriately addresses the problems mentioned above would
significantly simplify the development of engineering models for fully
and\/or partially buried structures.  Such a methodology would allow the
 soil effects to be captured without unduly increasing the extent and
complexity of the model of the structure, with consideration of
frequency effects, nonlinear behaviors (e.g., related to porosity and
saturation), and the inherent uncertainties associated with soil
behaviors (especially since soil"s data in such problems is likely to be
 sparse).      This proposal looks for characterizing soil effects on
the blast and shock response of a structure to reduce computation time
in the simulation of underground structures subjected to blast induced
shock waves.      PHASE I:  Investigate soil material models for their
applications to structural analyses under extremely high loading rates
such as blast load.  Develop nonlinear impedance functions for general
geo-materials and evaluate candidate techniques for the introduction of
arching effects.    PHASE II:  Develop mathematical soil transfer
functions (STFs) based on nonlinear impedance functions in closed form
following compatibility condition.  Compatibility between the FE model
and the STF model should address concerns related to discontinuities at
the soil-structure interface (e.g., due to arching).  Implement
mathematical STFs in an existing FE code that should use actual soils
data and be validated against results from weapon effects soil-structure
 tests as a final product of this phase.    PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS:  Incorporate the soil modeling concept (i.e., implemented
as a new type of element) for simulating nonlinear soil characteristics
under extremely high loading rates into general FE method software.  In
this implementation, the shape of the element (i.e., the soil-structure
module) will be of a form similar to a general shell or solid element.
This element would be suitable for incorporation into commercial
software, which will allow it to be used widely for the analysis of
structural systems where SSI is important.  Such a module can also be
used for the prediction of ground shock effects due to explosive-based
excavations and seismic excitations.  The technology developed may also
be implemented in the form of a FRM to represent surrounding soil layers
 with small numbers of element.",

seeks development of new combined effects explosives (CEX) that provide
superior performance in both metal accelerating capability and enhanced
blasts.  DTRA desires that these new CEX formulations be guided and
designed by a first-principles numerical simulations that describe
detonation, anaerobic reaction (reaction between fuel components and
oxidizer components of the explosive after the detonation) and aerobic
reaction (reaction between remaining fuel components and the ambient
air).  The explosive would have at least an equivalent metal
acceleration capability of the best current Service certified
explosives, while producing 50 % more blast than the best current
Service certified explosives.    PHASE I:  Development of proof of
concept, with design guidance from rigorous numerical simulations and
through small scale testing, for a class of combined effects explosives
(CEX) that provide superior performance in both metal accelerating
capability and enhanced blasts.      PHASE II:  Develop, scale up
combined effects explosives and demonstrate their technology in
prototype weapon configuration demonstrations.   Deliverables are a
prototype demonstration, experimental data, numerical simulation
methodology and analyses.    PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  Develop
Army, Navy or Air Force explosives to be used in their munitions.
Explore drop-in replacement opportunities for use of CEX materials
developed in Phase I and II to replace current high explosives used in
current inventory weapons.  Demonstrate the advantages of the CEP
materials over existing high explosives using the modeling capability
developed in Phase I and II, with emphasis on the minimization of
technical risk due to use of high fidelity predictive capability.",

Blasts",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop reactive structural
materials (RSM) that will replace steel cases of munitions so that the
munitions will generate much stronger blast performance while
maintaining a certain degree of penetration capability into targets.
DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency desires to develop
reactive structural materials (RSM) for increased blast effectiveness of
 certain munitions. In these conceptual munitions, steel warhead cases
are completely or partially replaced with reactive structural material
cases. When a steel case is completely replaced by an RSM case, the RSM
is expected to have high density and strength enough to allow the
munition to be able to penetrate moderate strength targets, such as
triple brick walls.  When an RSM is not as strong or dense, it can be
used together with a somewhat thinner steel case to achieve the same
penetration objective as above.  Either way, munitions with these RSM
cases are expected to generate significantly stronger blast (at least
three times stronger) than conventional counterpart munitions with steel
 cases with a case-mass-to-fill-mass-ratio of 3:1.   Low manufacture
cost of such RSM is highly desirable.    PHASE I:  Development of proof
of concept, through small scale testing, for a class of RSM that will
allow conceptual munitions with the RSM to generate 3 times as powerful
blast while maintaining its penetration capability into triple brick
walls.      PHASE II:  Develop, scale up RSM and demonstrate its
technology in prototype munitions, supported by testing and numerical
simulations to the extent possible.   Demonstrate that the RSM can be
manufactured at low cost.  Deliverables are a prototype demonstration,
experimental data, a model, numerical simulation technology and
substantiating analyses.    PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  Develop
Army, Navy or Air Force munitions with enhanced blasts and desirable
fragment characteristics.  Explore drop-in replacement opportunities for
 use of RSM materials developed in Phase I and II to replace current
inert warhead structural materials used in current inventory weapons.
Demonstrate the advantages of the RSM materials over existing inert
structure through model analyses combined with field and generic target
testing of weapon-scale generic warheads followed by tests of new design
 warheads.      REFERENCES;  1.  Figure 7 of William Wilson, LV

        "topic_name": "Insensitive Munitions Disposal Attack",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a means of causing
detonation of Insensitive Munitions (IM) and\/or bulk Insensitive High
Explosives (IHE) without using large amounts of donor explosives.
Device needs to be capable of attacking IM ranging in size from 81mm to
missile warheads and bulk explosives in quantities exceeding five
pounds.    DESCRIPTION: A means is needed to assist in the disposal of
munitions or devices using IHE.  Current disposal procedures require
excessive disposal charges due to the main charge explosives being made
less sensitive to shock.  These procedures increase blast overpressure
and fragment hazard distances. Additionally, current demolitions
materials are shifting to IHE which will make them less sensitive to
current demolition initiation methods.      Current 66mm shape charges
being pursued may prove impractical in WMD using IHE.  Shape charge
technology, improved insensitive explosives, and penetration rounds have
 all shown promise, but none have yet proven to be the answer.  Water
jet or thermic based technology are also possible answers but have not
yet been thoroughly researched or developed.  Innovations using
described technologies can be a solution to this problem, but other
innovative and promising approaches will also be considered.  Regardless
 of the specific approach, the product needs to be man portable and
equal to or preferably weighing less than current means; for example, a
pound for a projectile and 10 pounds for a larger bomb.      As the
Unites States Military and our partners shift to IM and IHE the
likelihood for military and civilian personnel to have to dispose of it
will only increase.  Both civilian and military bomb disposal
technicians will be put at a great disadvantage if they have no reliable
 method to dispose of IM and IHE.  Movement to IHE in civilian blasting
is currently unknown.    PHASE I:  Phase I should conduct studies to
develop an item to breech munitions cases and initiate the explosives.
Item must show the capability of penetrating munitions\/WMD cases of
various thicknesses, up to 1\/2 inch, and capable of causing a high
order detonation.  Low order detonations and\/or candle burns are less
desirable.  The decision to move to Phase II will be based upon
likelihood of success based upon computer modeling and\/or practical
demonstration.    PHASE II:   Phase II must develop a prototype of the
new tool or unique explosive. Any new explosive items must obtain
requisite explosives certification. Item must show consistency in
attacking both heavy and thin cased IM of various calibers and
configurations.   A 10 for 10 level of consistency is the desired
outcome against representative projectiles, bombs, and bulk samples. The
 results should be quantitatively compared to those of existing
technologies in the same environments.  Existing military\/civilian law
enforcement initiation systems are the required means of initiation. The
 Phase II close-out must include a plan for follow-on production and
fielding.    PHASE III: Phase III must include identification of support
 for commercialization of the item to include support from other
government entities. Third party verified demonstrations for the DoD and
 DHS community should clearly demonstrate 99% reliability of the
disposal of IM without kick outs.  In that this is a disposal tool, cost
 per use should be kept low (threshold $100\/objective $25) and should
not require cost prohibitive consumables.  Weight and cube of final
design must minimize weight and cube while being all weather capable.",

        "topic_name": "Intelligent Clothing for Rapid Response to Aid
Wounded Soldiers",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop uniforms with integrated
sensors built into the fabric allowing for measurement of overall
health, detection of bullet location, detection of exposure to CBRNE
(Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear and Explosive) agents, and
communication capabilities to provide location via GPS coordinates as
well as critical health assessment information to medical personnel
regarding the wounded soldier.     DESCRIPTION:  In a situation where a
soldier has been hit with either a single bullet or shrapnel from an
explosion or has been exposed to CBRNE within their surrounding
environment, it is critical to quickly evaluate the vital organs that
have been impacted and the life-saving procedures that need to be
performed.  Current practice involves calling human medics to assess
injuries and provide first aid or stabilization. This causes inevitable
delay and with CBRNE may prevent first aid.     With Intelligent
Clothing, the location of a bullet can be determined with
appropriately-embedded sensors within the clothing"s fibers that can
estimate the depth of penetration and the effected surrounding organs.
Additionally, if the person was in an environment where a CBRNE weapon
had been stored, manufactured, or used, the Intelligent Clothing could
identify the agents via specific biomarkers detected within the blood,
saliva, sweat, urine, or could distinguish damage at the cellular,
tissue, and\/or organ levels post exposure.  For example, individuals
exposed to a commonly used explosives compound, 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene
(TNT), have been shown to have hemoglobin adducts within their blood and
 form the urine metabolites of TNT, 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4ADNT)
and 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2ADNT), all of which can be utilized as
biomarkers for TNT.  In addition, radiation biomarkers include
alterations in serum enzyme levels post exposure to ionizing radiation,
such as modifications in serum amylase and diamine oxidase concentration
 levels, which are presently being considered as potential biodosimeters
 within the medical community.  These biomarkers could then be linked to
 the appropriate array of sensors within the Intelligent Clothing
material to detect CBRNE targets, and this information could then be
transmitted immediately to emergency responders via communications
devices weaved directly into the fabric.  This aids in triage and
preparation of first responders to be able to handle emergency
situations in a critically timely and efficient manner. The collected
remotely data would provide commanders venue battlefield awareness as to
 type of weapons, numbers of casualties and location of engagements.
DTRA requires an assessment of the suitability of various biosensors,
communications options and means of integrating these with the
appropriate clothing materials and also considering relevant
characteristics of the Intelligent Clothing (i.e.  size, thickness,
weight, robustness, power requirements, lifetime, as well as sensor
sensitivity and selectivity) and the added burdens for the individual
troop to manage.    PHASE I:  Identify appropriate types of the fabrics,
 sensors, and related components that are currently available and may be
 useful for intelligent clothing systems.  This phase would also include
 the selection of biomarkers specific to each agent along with
corresponding sensor, and a proof of concept demonstrating operability
of components within the military uniform.     PHASE II:  Design of
selected sensor interfaces and conduct a demonstration of a uniform
containing a sensor and communications network.    PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: Other applications currently being researched include
heart\/muscle monitoring for athletes, vitals measurements for babies,
and blood sugar levels for Type I and Type II diabetics.  Dual Use may
be possible for occupations involving hazardous work conditions, mobile
diagnostic of life style (as in mobile heart monitors).  Furthermore,
identification of potential commercial partners and\/or
commercialization markets in which Intelligent Clothing technology could
 be transitioned to as an end-user or for further
optimization\/development.",

individual portable, light weight, all-weather, self-powered device to
identify the filler of unknown ordnance and suspect devices without
opening the case for sampling in order to determine safety precautions,
protective measures, and disposal methods while wearing chemical
protective clothing.      DESCRIPTION: First responders need the
capability to quickly examine suspect items to determine chemical,
biological, radiological, and high explosive materials.  Any technology
that can provide on-site interrogation of suspect material through
casings without requiring contact with the material is acceptable.  The
desired prototype must be capable of being used by personnel with
minimum to no training.    The current Portable Isotopic Neutron
Spectroscopy (PINS) Systems and the Swept Frequency Acoustic
Interferometry (SFAI) are currently not sufficiently ruggedized, require
 operator training, and are not field upgradeable. However, improvements
 upon the science of those devices are acceptable.      PHASE I: Must
show in a laboratory environment the capability of penetrating
munitions\/WMD cases of hardened steel or composite materials up to 1\/2
 inch thicknesses and classifying the liquid or solid material.  90%
identification rate in a lab setting must be capable of identification
of both solids and liquids at a full spectrum of ambient operational
temperature ranges. In this phase, the device must be able to
differentiate generically between explosives, biological materials,
radioactive materials, war gasses, and inert materials and provide
analysis and read-out to the device operator. A design concept for a
prototype that will improve upon current commercially available devices
will be a key decision point for continuation to Phase II.      PHASE
II: Phase II must develop a prototype device that can be validated
independently.  The prototype device must show consistency in attacking
both heavy (1\/2 inch) and thin cased items (&gt;1\/8 inch) of various
calibers and configurations.   A 9 for 10 level of consistency is the
desired outcome in a field setting. Device must be capable of being
operated and the interrogation information processed on-site by
individuals with minimal training. In this phase the device must be able
 to differentiate between specific types of explosives, biological
materials, radioactive materials, war gasses, and inert materials. The
prototype device must also have a field upgradable library to learn new
materials as they are encountered. The threshold for the prototype
device is 30 lbs. with an objective of 10 lbs.  Prototype must be
battery operated.  Phase II final report should include a development
plan for follow-on production and a Phase III roadmap.    PHASE III:
Phase III must include identification of support for commercialization
of the device to include other government and commercial entities. Third
 party verified demonstrations for the DoD and DHS community should
clearly demonstrate threshold of 95% and an objective of 99% reliability
 of filler identification.  Modification for ruggedization should be
carefully undertaken to minimize any increases in weight or cube. Device
 should be capable of operating using a common battery type and capable
of a threshold of 10 samples and objective of 25 samples before the
device must be recharged or the batteries replaced.  Device cannot
require special nuclear licensing or pose a radiation threat if used in a
 TSA or DHS environment.  The device catalog\/library must be field
upgradable and contain the standard explosives, war gasses, biological
materials, toxic industrial chemicals, toxic industrial materials, and
radiological materials that are currently of interest to the DoD and
DHS. If the device uses a laser, it must be eye-safe. Desired cost of
reproducible units is less than $50,000 per copy.",

 Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals, their
country of origin, and what tasks each would accomplish in the statement

OBJECTIVE:  We seek proposals to develop radiation detectors of extended
 range and capability based on the detection of alternative signatures
to facilitate the rapid detection and localization of radiological and
nuclear threats.     DESCRIPTION:  In DTRA"s efforts to interdict
Special Nuclear Material (SNM), standoff detection capabilities have the
 potential to be advanced through the detection of alternative
signatures. This mode refers to the detection of a radioactive material
by means other than by the direct interaction of gammas or neutrons
emitted by the source.  Examples include techniques that are capable of
exploiting the physical or chemical characteristics of radioactive
material (e.g. density, temperature, spectral) or their effect of the
surrounding environment (e.g. O3 production via radiolysis, N2
excitation by secondary electrons).    As for one example, when gamma,
beta, and alpha radiation interact with the atmosphere produce certain
ions and chemicals which, while not providing spectroscopic information
about the source, may be more readily detected at standoff than the
radiation itself.  Radiolytic products such as ozone (O3) and nitrogen
oxides (NO and NO2), in particular situations, may be produced in
sufficient quantities with lifetimes adequate for detection.  Although
some of these products may be naturally present in the atmosphere,
elevated levels may be indicative of a radioactive source.  As such, a
study of anticipated signal-to-noise ratios is appropriate.
Techniques with potential for the detection of radiolytics products at
standoff include but are not limited to Laser Induced Fluorescence
(LIF), Raman Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(FTIR) absorption, Differential Absorption LIDAR (DIAL) and passive
microwave detection of short-lived elemental hydrogen.    PHASE I:
Phase I should conduct a study on the signal-to-noise ratio of the
radiolytic products to the natural background. A design concept for a
new sensor and demonstrate how it will improve the measurement
capability of existing systems with respect to accuracy, false alarm
rate and standoff.  A clear Phase I to Phase II decision point must be
part of the final delivery in Phase I along with a roadmap that takes
the program through Phase III.    PHASE II:  Phase II must develop
prototype sensor that can be validated independently.  The results
should be quantitatively compared to those of existing technologies in
the same environments.  Relative cost\/benefit studies should be
performed to demonstrate the advantages of the new technology.  The
Phase II final report should include a development plan and partnering
approach for follow-on production and fielding along with a roadmap that
 takes the program through Phase III.    PHASE III:  Phase III must
include identification of support for commercialization of the sensor
system to include other government and commercial entities.",

fabrics and heat resistant equipment; development of enhanced materials
for C-WMD operations using novel nanomaterial processing techniques.
DESCRIPTION:  Recent research has found that using clay nanoparticles to
 reinforce a polyurethane material makes it 20 times as stiff and twice
as resistant to heat.  This process uses two solvents, one to disperse
the clay nanoparticles and one to dissolve the polyurethane.  When the
two solvents are mixed, the nanoparticles spread evenly throughout the
dissolved polymer.  When the second solvent is removed, the clay
particles are trapped within the tangle of polymer chains.  This process
 is able to leave areas of the polyurethane flexible, so that the
material can stretch substantially without breaking, and the material
does not get brittle.      The application of this material would be in
the fabrication of tear-resistant clothing for military use, or in the
creation of lightweight, resilient packaging.  Further, since this
material has high heat resistance, it could be used in equipment that is
 exposed to elevated temperatures.  This research is also to investigate

C2 systems to include ARCGIS and GOGGLE Earth like applications.
DESCRIPTION:  Current analysis for CBNRE toolsets are displayed as 2-D
visualizations at a selected time step.  These images are then placed in
 MS PowerPoint, ArcGIS Layer files or Goggle shape files.  Although this
 allows the product to be viewed in the customers"C2 system of choice,
the images only depict the plume in two dimensions (x, y), or (x, z).
Critical data such as horizontal and vertical extent as well as time,
take several images to clearly articulate.  The raw data from these
software tools are in gridded format and have x, y, z and time
associated with them.  Based on computer technology at the inception of
these programs, 3-D visualization was seen as to intensive for the quick
 calculations needed.  However, it is believed that technology has
matured enough to reinvestigate this decision.  Commanders currently
have extensive visualization capabilities within their operations
centers.  With this capability, a single image can display horizontal
extent as well as vertical variations critical to land, sea and airborne
 operations.  Recent experience in Operation TOMADACHI supporting United
 States Forces Japan (USFJ) showed how critical this capability has
become.  Our models of the radioactive release from the damaged reactors
 had to be briefed in multiple parts.  The first part was the current
expected extent of the contamination in a Goggle Earth display to show
the potential impact to fielded forces, followed by a MS PowerPoint
slide depicting the estimated maximum vertical extent for the entire
forecast period and concluding with a series of slides showing the
progression of the plume in a horizontal display over time.  With a
series 3-D images the horizontal and vertical extents could be quickly
shown and a time lapse of these images would show the evolution of the
plume over time.    PHASE I:  Develop a method to demonstrate that the
raw data can be ingested and projected in a 3-dimensional display.  This
 process can be part of the parent program, or as a third party add on.
 The software should be able to operate on a standard laptop 64-bit
machine running MS Windows 7 or higher.     PHASE II:  Develop a module
that will integrate into the parent program or can be included in future
 software releases as third parties add on.  The program must meet DoD
Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program (DIACAP)
compliance standards and visualizations timelines must not exceed 60
seconds from ingest of data to display.  Final product must be able to
be ported to ArcGIS, Goggle Earth or comparable visualization systems.
Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) should be developed to make the creation
 of these displays easy to follow and execute in a time constrained
environment.  The software should be able to operate on a standard

Realization Generator",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a real-time implementation of
 a channel realization generator for frequency-selective fading
channels. The channel realizations must take the form of sampled
time-varying impulse response functions or time-varying transfer
functions. DTRA"s Generalized Power Spectral Density (GPSD) currently
provides the only statistical formulation of fading channels arising
from high-altitude nuclear detonations that is accepted throughout the
DoD.  DTRA"s ACIRF code generates channel realizations characterized by
GPSD statistics, and provides DoD"s strategic communication and radar
communities with a DTRA-approved method of representing disturbed
trans-ionospheric propagation channels. DTRA seeks innovative channel
realization generator methods that have all of the GPSD-based modeling
capabilities of DTRA"s ACIRF code, while better serving those
applications requiring real-time or higher-speed channel realization
synthesis. Such applications include hardware-in-the-loop RF fading
channel simulators that test strategic communication and radar systems
operating under simulated disturbed-propagation conditions, as well as
fast-running software simulations that analyze scintillation-hardened
communication and radar system design concepts. To support
commercialization, the real-time channel realization generator should be
 extendable to support the propagation channels exhibiting non-GPSD
fading statistics such as those typically employed for testing and
analyzing non-strategic communication and radar systems.    DESCRIPTION:
 DTRA has supported DoD"s strategic communication and radar communities
by: 1) formulating models of propagation channels disrupted by
high-altitude nuclear weapons effects (NWEs) that realistically
represent received signal scintillation (i.e., distortion and fading);
2) developing detailed computer simulations to analyze and predict the
disturbed-channel performance of strategic RF systems; and 3) developing
 hardware-in-the-loop fading channel simulators, which have been used
for developmental and acceptance testing of strategic RF systems. These
research activities have given DoD two important capabilities: 1) the
ability to scintillation-harden the design of strategic RF systems; and
2) the ability to test the performance of fielded RF systems under
simulated wartime conditions. These capabilities are dependent upon
DTRA"s fading channel models, the mechanization of which is the subject
of this topic.    Time-varying RF channels are assumed to be linear, and
 therefore can be represented using time-varying complex baseband
impulse response functions or transfer functions. The fading channels of
 interest are assumed to be random, and are described using the
statistical characterization presented in Reference 1.  DTRA has
developed a particular parameterized statistical formulation called the
Generalized Power Spectral Density (GPSD), based on Gaussian statistics,
 which characterizes a range of random fading channel models that are
appropriate for ionospheric propagation paths disturbed by high-altitude
 NWEs. The ACIRF code is a software mechanization of the GPSD that also
models the filtering effects of the receive antenna.  ACIRF generates
pseudo-random baseband equivalent realizations of RF fading channels.
Both the ACIRF code and its underlying GPSD statistical fading channel
formalization are described in Reference 2.    Although the ACIRF code
has proven to be a valuable tool, it has limitations. It runs off-line
to generate one fixed-length realization that must be stored and
repeatedly played back to represent a fading channel over a long time
duration. This approach has two drawbacks. First, the fading channel
cannot be as well-represented with a repeating fixed-length channel
realization update sequence as with an arbitrarily long non-repeating
sequence of channel realization updates. Second, any test or analysis
application using ACIRF realizations must storage and retrieval
capability to accept and playback ACIRF realizations, rather than just
accepting a stream of channel realization updates. Also, the fading
channel represented by a single ACIRF realization is stationary.
Non-stationary channels can only be represented in an ad-hoc fashion by
interpolating or other-wise piecing together multiple ACIRF
realizations. Finally, ACIRF only generates complex baseband
realizations with Rayleigh or Rician amplitude statistics. This is
appropriate for the highly-disturbed propagation paths associated with
extreme wartime conditions, but not for propagation paths disturbed by
natural phenomena such as tropospheric scatter or auroral effects.
The goal of this topic is to identify innovative real-time channel
realization generator implementations that can create non-repeating
GPSD-based channel realizations exhibiting user-definable non-stationary
 statistics that become immediately available as needed in real-time or
high-speed applications without being stored and retrieved. To enhance
commercialization possibilities, the channel realization generator
should also support non-Gaussian or non-GSPD-based random fading channel
 models for the testing and analysis of non-strategic RF systems.
PHASE I: Develop the design of the proposed channel realization
generator in sufficient detail to quantify the ranges of decorrelation
times, frequency-selective bandwidths, and signal bandwidths for which
the proposed design can sustain real-time operation. Also, develop an
off-line (i.e., non-real-time) software emulation of the proposed
implementation that can create testable channel realization update
sequences. Formulate metrics or figures of merit that gauge the fidelity
 with which the generated channel realizations exhibit GPSD statistics,
and provide a direct comparison to realizations created by the ACIRF
code. Write a DTRA Certification test plan.    PHASE II: Build the
channel realization generator implementation designed during Phase I.
Describe how the implementation can be interfaced to or embedded into a
high-speed software simulation (such as the COMLNK code described in
Reference 3) or the MATLAB Communications Toolkit described in Reference
 4 or a hardware-in-the-loop fading channel simulator (such as the
Configurable Link Test Set described in Reference 5). Write a detailed
operator manual explaining how to use the channel realization generator.
 Execute the DTRA Certification test plan written during Phase I.
PHASE III: Separate marketing strategies may be required for DoD and
commercial applications. For DoD applications, team with software
simulation or hardware-in-the-loop channel simulator developers to
directly integrate the original GPSD-specific implementation of the
channel realization generator into their products. Non-GSPD and possibly
 even non-Gaussian implementations could be developed for non-strategic
RF system testing and analysis.",

        "topic_name": "Formulation Development to Enhance
Bioavailability and Pharmacokinetic Profile of Protein-based Drugs",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop novel methods to improve
bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profile of protein-based drugs.
 DESCRIPTION: Protein-based drugs are becoming an increasingly important
 class of drugs.  A great deal of effort is being made to improve their
efficacy by improving their bioavailability and increasing their
stability within the circulatory system.  For example, Human-derived
Butyrylcholinesterase (hBuChE) remains to be an effective treatment for
pre- and post- exposure to nerve agents.  Human BuChE is produced from
outdated human plasma and requires large quantities for production.
Estimates made in 2008, indicate that the existing capabilities to
process blood to be used for bioscavenger production could only make
100,000 doses of bioscavenger per year, far below the estimates needed
for protecting the entire military and civilian population.  Since the
source is limited, it necessitates the need to find an alternate, more
reliable source of hBuChE.  To date, much of the research has focused on
 recombinant expression systems.  Human BuChE has been successfully made
 from transgenic goats, transgenic plants, and cultured mammalian cells.
  Unfortunately several challenges have been identified using these
alternate systems.  These challenges include:    1.)  Reduced
bioavailability in the blood    2.)  Short half life in the blood stream
    There are several methods that can be employed to increase the half
life of proteins, including pegylation, sialylation etc.  It is thought
that sialic acids on hBuChE may be responsible for its half-life in the
blood stream.      To resolve the challenges, formulation development
should focus on the following:    1.)  Delivering a protein either
intramuscularly or subcutaneously and have it be rapidly (within
minutes) bioavailable in the blood.    2.)  Delivering a protein
intramuscularly or subcutaneously that will be enzymatically active and
have an extended circulatory presence (multiple days) without inducing
an immune response or causing any pathology.    3.)  Store an enzyme for
 long periods of time on the shelf without loss of activity, in a format
 that is either ready for injection or can rapidly be made ready for
injection.    The current goal for a maximum dose of a bioscavenger is 1
 mg\/kg (or roughly 80 mg\/adult person), with proteins that are soluble
 in the 2-20 mg\/ml range.  It is possible that a dry or semi-solublized
 formulation could be injected.  The key parameter is getting active
enzyme into the blood.      Development of a technique(s) to improve the
 bioavailability and stability in the circulatory system of a
bioscavenger like BuChE could be applied to any protein-based drug that
could be used in Chemical and Biological Defense treatments.    PHASE I:
  Initially, develop a formulation(s) that will improve the
bioavailability (within minutes of administration) and pharmacokinetic
profile of a protein-based drug, selected by the proposer.  The product
formulation should extend its shelf life and be readily amenable for
intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.  Demonstration of the
formulation should be evaluated for 2 different proteins in vitro to
show that there is no loss of protein activity due to the protein
modifications or formulation.    PHASE II:  Evaluate the pharmacokinetic
 profile of the formulated protein in plasma in an appropriate animal
model to demonstrate that the formulation is superior to existing
methodology with regards to protein half-life (greater than 2-fold
increase) compared to native protein.  In addition, perform
toxicologogical and immunological studies in an appropriate animal model
 to demonstrate that the formulations and modification to the protein
does not induce toxicity or an undesired immune response.  Demonstration
 should be conducted on 2 proteins selected by the proposer.    PHASE
III:  Conduct further characterization of the formulated proteins.  The
proposer should also begin developing a pilot-scale manufacturing
process of the formulated protein(s) internally or with a collaborator.
 An appropriate transition or collaborative partner(s) who will
implement this technology in their cGMP manufacturing of protein-based
drugs to support the warfighter mission or commercial interests should
be identified.",

        "topic_name": "Advanced Purification Technology for the
Manufacture of Vaccines, Biologic Drugs, and Enzymes",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop novel,
non-synthetic-resin-based protein purification technologies that enables
 the low-cost production of kilogram quantities of proteins for chemical
 and biological defense applications.      DESCRIPTION:  Recent
investments by the DoD have been made in areas to increase the agility
of the government to respond to a future pandemic or
chemical\/biological threat in development of appropriate
countermeasures.  This includes novel manufacturing platforms that can
rapidly respond to expression of a given protein, given an unknown
target sequence, and also rapidly scale the production of protein to
meet national needs. The utility of these manufacturing platforms
however can extend beyond protein based vaccines and therapeutics and
have proven potential in manufacturing industrial proteins at scale for
other DoD applications such as sensors and remediation based
technologies.  The protein manufacturing process generally consists of
two distinct phases: 1) protein synthesis and 2) recovery and
purification of the protein of interest from the matrix of the source
organism.  Although efforts are ongoing to develop alternative
expression platforms (recombinant protein manufacturing hosts), often
the low cost production of the desired protein ("Upstream"production)
does not reduce the"Downstream"costs of manufacturing.      The
downstream processing costs typically represent the majority of the
expense associated with manufacturing recombinant proteins and can be as
 high as 60 to 80% of the total manufacturing costs for biologic drugs.
 These costs can often be prohibitory in development and deployment of a
 viable countermeasure technology.  Current protein manufacturing
technology relies primarily on chromatographic resins and other methods
which have been used for decades.  Ion exchange chromatography, size
exclusion chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography,
affinity chromatography, and other similar methods are well understood
process steps that are relied upon as workhorses in protein therapeutic
manufacturing.  While these methods are functionally robust, they tend
to be expensive to execute with high material and labor costs and limit
the amount of product that can be produced from a single production
batch. In addition, the purification materials (resins, etc) themselves
can be limited in availability for large scale use without long lead
times.    Recent advances have been made in exploring alternative
methods, such as aqueous phase separation or self-cleaving affinity
tags.  Advanced downstream processing technologies that are widely
applicable to recovery and purification of a number of protein classes
and applications are needed.  Preference will be given to
biotechnology-based strategies which can supplant traditional
chromatographic methods and their associated high labor and material
costs.  The technology should be applicable to recover and purify
proteins from various production hosts and provide significant cost
reductions of at least two-fold compared to conventional methods.  The
technology should also demonstrate ability to scale on demand for use in
 rapid response manufacturing.  The technology must provide purified
protein preparations with technical specifications as good as or better
than conventional technologies across a range of targets.    PHASE I:
Develop a non-synthetic-resin-based protein purification technology
capable of recovering and purifying a range of protein products in a
manner which meets the technical requirements for the specific
proteins-of-interest.  Express and purify two (2) different proteins of
interest to the DoD at pilot scale using the novel technology and
demonstrate purity is comparable or better to that of the same proteins
expressed in same expression platform but purified with traditional
chromatographic methods.      PHASE II:  Demonstrate a cost-effective
production technology (2-fold less compared to conventional
technologies) for selected protein product targets relevant to the DoD.
 Demonstrate that the technical efficiency of recovery, protein product
quality and cost efficiency of the process are suitable for the protein
product.  Demonstrate the utility of this process at large scale.
PHASE III:  The development of a novel downstream processing technology
should complement novel large scale biological expression platform
technologies being developed by the DoD to rapidly express proteins of
interest for medical countermeasures and industrial technologies.  The
proposer should identify appropriate transition or collaborative
partners who will use this technology in their manufacturing process in
expression of proteins that support the warfighter mission.  The
economic purification of these proteins may also be beneficial in the
commercial sector and for Homeland Security.",

Architectures",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate a DNA design
 automation software package that allows for the specification of large
and complex DNA-based architectures.  Develop methods to define and
manipulate charge and hydrophilicity at the nanoscale.    DESCRIPTION:
The folding of single- and double-stranded DNA is a chemically
well-understood and controllable process.  DNA is generally associated
with the storage of genetic information.  However, in many ways, it is
also an ideal building material.  DNA"s sequence dictates its shape and
structure. Recently, progress has facilitated inexpensive and easy
manufacturing of DNA strands with custom sequences.  Much of the science
 of DNA origami is centered on producing better design software.  The
ability to produce better design software is a critical component of the
 controlled design and production of large complex structures using DNA
origami.  There is a need in the chemical\/biological defense community
to develop new and novel bio-structures.  In particular, DNA
self-assembly methods have become useful in the mimicry of biological
systems such as antibodies and vaccines.  In order to mimic biological
systems, a DNA origami structure must possess a shape that mimics the
antibody or vaccine structure.  It needs to also mimic the charge
distribution and hydrophobic\/hydrophilic nature of a bio-structure at
the nanoscale.     To extend DNA origami techniques to bio-molecular
applications, the development of simulation tools for defining
electrostatic and hydrophilic properties of structure at the nanoscale
are needed.  In the DNA origami approach, a large DNA structure, such as
 a plasmid or virus, is tethered together using short strands of DNA
that are called"staples".  Since every base of the staple DNA strands
can be modified, the surface charge distribution on the surface of a DNA
 origami can be controlled.  Likewise hydrophobic and hydrophilic
regions can be precisely determined and manipulated.  However, current
design software packages do not support these needs.  Improved design
software is needed to support the requirements of the
chemical\/biological defense community.      Recent advances in the
development of evolutionary search algorithms have provided the ability
to perform optimizations over sequence design spaces previously thought
to be intractable.  However, a comprehensive development tool for
developing very complex DNA-based nanostructures and architectures still
 does not exist.  An ideal development tool would be able to determine
optimal sequence sets according to first principle constraints that are
imposed by topology, molecular thermodynamics and self-assembly
kinetics.  The system would also be able to accommodate designs with up
to 30,000 bases and arbitrarily complex pseudo-knots.  An ideal system
would also address the problem of localized target melting temperatures
and would address kinetics as well as thermodynamic issues.  A necessary
 component of a new design tool will be a graphical user interface (GUI)
 which would allow specification of nanostructure designs, including
strand position and topology, designation of the location of non-DNA
species in the design and the designation of fixed bases versus variable
 bases.    PHASE I:  Produce a detailed requirements document for a
design automation tool that addresses the needs of the chemical and
biological defense community in the area of bio-mimicry using DNA
origami techniques.  In particular, the ability to define charge
distribution as well as hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity at the
nanoscale should be addressed.  The DNA-based design should also address
 the computational resources that will be required for these
applications.  Design software that can function in a distributed
computing environment is preferred.  A description of the core
thermodynamics and sequence optimization algorithms should be provided.
 A distributed, design tool architecture should be proposed that
satisfies the usability and computational complexity challenges of the
envisioned application.  A plan for producing DNA staples with necessary
 functionality should be addressed.  Phase I efforts that also include a
 corresponding proof-of-concept software demonstration are strongly
preferred.    PHASE II:  Develop a prototype software application that
allows complex nanostructure designs to be specified and automatically
populated with optimized sequences.  Develop design software that allows
 for the specification of charge and hydrophilic\/hydrophobic structures
 at the nanoscale.  The research and development work should include
experimental verification that the resultant sequence sets self-assemble
 into the targeted designs with high fidelity and yield. The relevance
to defense and security applications should be demonstrated through
simulation of a bio-molecular structure response.  In particular, the
problem of molecular recognition should be addressed.  Non-covalent
bonding to a biomolecule of interest should be modeled and demonstrated.
  For demonstration purposes, Streptavidin should be used as a target
molecule.     PHASE III:  Further research and development during Phase
III efforts will be directed towards refining a final design,
incorporating design modifications based on results from tests conducted
 during Phase II, and improving the software to meet Chemical and
Biological Defense Programs goals and end-user requirements.     PHASE
III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The new design software will have broad
impact across several avenues of defense applications.  Once an
effective prototype software system is achieved, the system will be
amenable to the design of numerous architectures for biological sensing
and characterization.  Specifically, the software will be a key enabler
of sensors having relevance to scientific studies of biological
materials, to the detection and identification of biological threats, to
 medical diagnostics and therapeutics of biological induced diseases,
and to the monitoring of commercial consumables for biological
contamination.",

        "topic_name": "Detection of Liquid Contaminants on Surfaces
Using Hyperspectral Imaging",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a hyperspectal imaging
standoff sensor for detecting liquid contaminants on surfaces using
passive infrared spectroscopy based on cold-sky reflectance.
DESCRIPTION:  Surface contamination by CB agents presents a serious
threat both to the civilian and military sectors and an adequate defense
 against these weapons will require rapid detection and identification
of both known and unknown agents. Recent measurements in the scientific
literature suggest that passive long wave infrared sensors are capable
of detecting liquids on the ground by utilizing cold sky reflectance.
Cold-sky reflection drives the physics of passive detection of liquids
on surfaces. The sky is radiometrically very cold, emitting far fewer
infrared photons than objects on the ground. Due to cold sky
reflectance, there is an apparent enhanced emission of the resonance
bands of the liquid on the ground, which is at ambient temperature. A
number of open literature publications have appeared that demonstrate
the ability of this technology to detect surface contamination at
relevant concentration for the needs of the chemical\/biological defense
 community. A passive infrared approach offers advantages in terms of
wide area detection capabilities.     The Joint Chemical Surface
Detector (JCSD) program has the goal of detecting liquid and solid
chemicals on the ground using noncontact technologies. The system is
required to rapidly interrogate the ground to provide wide area standoff
 detection of chemical warfare agents (CWA) and Toxic Industrial
Chemicals (TICs) in real-time. This system has shown the potential to
significantly increase the operational speed of the Stryker NBCRV and
future reconnaissance vehicles by enabling rapid surface agent detection
 and identification. Currently the JCSD program utilizes a laser Raman
based sensor. The laser system places a small laser spot on the ground.
The detection of a chemical contaminant is determined by inelastic
scatter from the liquid or solid contaminant. In situations where the
contamination is in the form of droplets, this requires that the laser
intercept a droplet of contaminated liquid. Also the use of a
laser-based detection system raised issues such as eye-safety hazards
and high power consumption.     The detection of relevant contaminants
on surfaces is challenging because they typically exist in the form of
sparse, optically thick droplets with a median mass diameter (MMD) of
0.5 mm or less. Contamination can be as low as 1 droplet per square
centimeter and still exceed the objective detection level of 0.5
gram\/m^2 that are set for the JSCD.  The current laser-based JSCD can
easily pass over a contaminated surface without detection due to low
probability of intercept of the small laser beam with a small droplet. A
 false negative can place personnel at risk.  A hyperspectral imaging
(HSI) approach would significantly increase the probability of intercept
 with a contaminated droplet on the ground.  In the HSI approach, a
large area is monitored.  A droplet appearing anywhere within the view
of the HSI instrument is instantly detected.  The false negative rate
would be significantly decreased, providing better protection for
personnel and equipment.     On-the-move detection of this sparse
droplet field is further complicated by the need to collect the signal
at short acquisition times and high frame rates in order to avoid
spatial and spectral blurring due to vehicle motion as well as increase
the probability of particle intercept within the detector"s field of
view. On-the-move operation requires vehicle speeds as fast as 45 miles
per hour.  Operating a hyperspectral imager at the very high data rates
imposed by this effort will require advances in high speed signal
processing and will likely require new algorithm development.  It is
envisioned that the initial HSI system would use approximately a 1 meter
 standoff detection distance looking a 30 to 60 degree angle from the
vertical and would be positioned in front of the moving vehicle.     It
is desirable to extend this technique to longer standoff ranges.  Using
passive standoff techniques, it should be possible to extend the
standoff range to 100 meters or more.  Operating at longer standoff
distances should be straightforward.  Passive detection utilizes
cold-sky reflection.  The cold-sky reflection provides a constant source
 term at all distances.  However, issues related to slant angle and
field-of-view will need to be determined.  Larger collection optics may
be required at longer distances.     PHASE I:  Conduct a feasibility
study of detecting liquid contaminants on the ground using a passive
long wave infrared hyperspectral imaging spectroradiometer operating in
the 8 to 12 m (micron) region of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Perform
spectral measurements of a contaminant deposited on concrete, painted
metal, grass, and sand surfaces in order to validate the sensor and
algorithm models.  For this study, a silicone based lubricant should be
used.  Examine droplets of mission-relevant sizes (~500 m, micron) on
relevant surfaces.  Examine the hyperspectral images of surfaces with
contaminant present and absent using unpolarized and S-polarized
infrared radiation.  Develop a system model and the conceptual design of
 a fast hyperspectral imaging detection system for on-the-move
detection.  The system should operate in the 8-12 micron region of the
spectral region and have necessary spectral resolution to detect
chemical agents.  The system should assume speeds of operation up to 45
mph with a standoff distance of 1-2 meters and a slant angle of 30 to 60
 degrees from the vertical.  The system should be able to detect 0.5 mm
droplets of contamination on a surface running at these velocities and
still provide coverage of a reasonable area in front of the
reconnaissance vehicle.  Examine issues related to slant-angle,
field-of-view, and collection optics.  Examine methods for extending the
 standoff range to larger distances.        PHASE II:  Develop a model
to describe how well the proposed system will perform.  After reviewing
the results of the model with the DoD Technical Point of Contact, build a
 hyperspectral imaging sensor operating in the 8-12 micron region of the
 spectral region that can operate from a moving vehicle traveling at 45
mph with a standoff distance of 1-2 meters and a slant angle of 30 to 60
 degrees from the vertical.  The system should have sufficient spectral
resolution to detect chemical agents.  The system should be able to
detect a 0.5 mm droplet of contamination on a surface running at 45 mph
and still provide coverage of a reasonable area in front of the
reconnaissance vehicle.  Develop necessary data acquisition system to
provide real-time detection of chemical agents and stimulants.  Develop
all necessary detection algorithms for real time detection.  Demonstrate
 detection of liquid contaminants on surfaces using a simulant such as a
 small amount of a silicone oil.  Examine the utility of using the
sensor at longer standoff ranges.  Examine methods for extending the
standoff range to 100 meters or more. Issues related to slant-angle,
field-of-view, and collection optics should be examined.     PHASE III:
 Further research and development during Phase III efforts will be
directed towards refining a final deployable design, incorporating
design modifications based on results from tests conducted during Phase
II, and improving engineering\/form-factors, equipment hardening, and
manufacturability designs to meet the operational requirements of the
Joint Chemical and Biological Defense Program, U.S. Army CONOPS and
end-user requirements.     PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  There are
many environmental applications for a sensitive standoff chemical
detector\/identifier.  A rugged, sensitive, and flexible standoff
chemical detector will benefit the manufacturing community by providing
very finely tuned monitoring of chemical processes. Also, first
responders such as Civil Support Teams (CST) and Fire Departments have a
 critical need for a rugged, versatile, and rugged sensor that can be
transported to the field to test for possible contamination by chemical
warfare agents.",

        "topic_name": "Oxygen Storage Technology for Closed-Circuit
Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To develop high-capacity,
low-pressure oxygen storage technology for the development of lower
maintenance and lighter weight closed-circuit self-contained breathing
apparatus with reduced logistical burden.     DESCRIPTION:  A
Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) is a type of respiratory
protection device that provides breathing gas from a source independent
of the surrounding atmosphere.  A closed-circuit SCBA
or"rebreather"re-circulates the breathing air after the carbon dioxide
has been removed and the oxygen content restored by either a compressed
or liquid oxygen source or an oxygen generating solid.  The most common
type of non-escape rebreather used in the workplace employ a compressed
oxygen cylinder under high pressure to replenish the depleted oxygen in
the re-circulated breathing air. The main advantage of a closed-circuit
verse an open-circuit SCBA, whereby the breathing gas from a compressed
air cylinder is exhaled to the outside, is the extended wear time
capable of these devices.  Rebreathers have a service life of up to 4
hours whereas open-circuit SCBAs have a maximum service life of only 45
minutes to one hour.  However, to achieve their long service life the
oxygen cylinder in a rebreather device must be filled to a high pressure
 (~3000 psi).  Special equipment and procedures are required to safely
handle and refill these specially designed high-pressure cylinders.
This substantially increases the cost and logistical burden of using
these devices.    Novel technology is needed to overcome the
shortcomings associated with high-pressure oxygen storage.  Innovative
oxygen storage solutions are sought that reduce the weight, maintenance,
 and overall logistic burden associated with high-pressure oxygen
cylinders while providing comparable performance in rebreather
applications.  Potential solutions may include novel physisorptive media
 (e.g., zeolites and carbon nanotubes), low-power oxygen concentrating
technology, or hybrid systems.  The goal is to develop a lower
maintenance, lower profile, and lighter weight closed-circuit SCBA for
unique military operations.  Such operations may include prolonged entry
 into immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) atmospheres or
unknown CBRN environments.      PHASE I:  Develop high-capacity,
low-pressure, oxygen storage technology that offers significant
improvements in the logistical burden associated with the refilling and
handling of high-pressure cylinders.  Demonstrate feasibility of
proposed enabling technology solution(s) through computer modeling and
use of existing empirical data where available.  Identify key
performance parameters and test criteria relevant to closed-circuit SCBA
 applications.  Establish test set up and procedures to assess and
validate proposed approach.  Fabricate physical"breadboard"model and
conduct bench top testing to characterize the performance of the
proposed solution(s) to include but not limited to the following, where
applicable to the proposed technology:  adsorption capacity, desorption
rate, adsorption enthalpy (thermodynamic properties), power
requirements, production by-products, and efficiency under relevant
temperature\/humidity conditions.      PHASE II:  Refine and optimize
Phase I breadboard model to improve oxygen storage capacity and
performance.  Perform follow-on bench top evaluations to verify
improvements made to the basic enabling technology.  Modify test setup
and improve test procedures as required.  Develop functional scalable
prototype by incorporating enabling technology into a suitable test bed
(e.g., oxygen storage platform or container). Characterize test bed
performance under an operational relevant range of external
environmental (temperature\/humidity) conditions and in-mask
heat\/humidity loads.  The evaluations should include characterizing the
 breathing air quality, release of any by-products, exothermic
reactions, and other factors relevant to the technology.  Based on
results obtained, implement necessary refinements to the scalable test

Closed-Circuit Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To develop high-capacity,
low-pressure carbon dioxide removal technology for the development of
lower maintenance and lighter weight closed-circuit self-contained
breathing apparatus with reduced logistical burden.    DESCRIPTION:  A
Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) is a type of respiratory
protection device that provides breathing gas from a source independent
of the surrounding atmosphere.  A closed-circuit SCBA
or"rebreather"re-circulates the breathing air after the carbon dioxide
has been removed and the oxygen content restored by either a compressed
or liquid oxygen source or an oxygen generating solid.  The most common
type of non-escape rebreather used in the workplace employs a compressed
 oxygen cylinder under high pressure to replenish the depleted oxygen in
 the re-circulated breathing air. Carbon dioxide is typically removed
using an absorbent material such as soda lime.  The primary advantage of
 a closed-circuit verse an open-circuit SCBA, whereby the breathing gas
from a compressed air cylinder is exhaled to the outside environment, is
 the extended wear time capable of these devices.  Rebreathers have a
service life of up to 4 hours whereas open-circuit SCBAs have a maximum
service life of only 45 minutes to one hour.  The current carbon dioxide
 removal process uses an exothermic reaction and does not remove the
water produced by the exhaled air.  The generated heat is typically
removed using ice or re-freezable cooler packs1,2 incorporated into the
re-breather system, increasing the weight and logistics.  Additionally,
the absorbent material cannot be regenerated and must be replaced when
expended.    Novel technology is needed to overcome the shortcomings
associated with carbon dioxide and water removal.  Innovative carbon
dioxide and water removal solutions are sought that reduce the
weight\/size, maintenance, and overall logistic burden associated with
currently employed chemical absorbent materials such as lithium
hydroxide while providing comparable performance in rebreather
applications.  Potential solutions may include novel physisorptive media
 (e.g., zeolites, carbon nanotubes), chemical reactions, or hybrid
systems.  Efficiency improvements that reduce exothermic heat production
 over current technologies are desirable.  Solutions that also generate
oxygen, such as with a KO2 process,3 are acceptable but not required.
Technologies that are non-hazardous in use and disposal are desirable.
The goal is to develop a lower maintenance, lower profile, and lighter
weight closed-circuit SCBA for unique military operations that does not
have the heat, size, and weight burden seen in current rebreather
systems.4   Such operations may include prolonged entry into immediately
 dangerous to life and health (IDLH) atmospheres or unknown CBRN
environments.      PHASE I:  Develop high-capacity, low-pressure carbon
dioxide removal technology that offers significant improvements in the
logistical burden associated with currently used absorbent materials and
 ice packs.  Demonstrate feasibility of proposed enabling technology
solution(s) through computer modeling and use of existing empirical data
 where available.  Identify key performance parameters and test criteria
 relevant to closed-circuit SCBA applications.  Establish test set-up
and procedures to assess and validate proposed approach.  Fabricate
physical"breadboard"model and conduct bench top testing to characterize
the performance of the proposed solution(s) to validate improvements to
the limitations of current rebreather materials to include but not
limited to the following where applicable to the proposed innovative
technology: adsorption capacity, desorption rate, adsorption enthalpy
(thermodynamic properties), power requirements, production by-products,
efficiency under relevant temperature\/humidity conditions, and
size\/weight reductions.      PHASE II:  Refine and optimize Phase I
breadboard model to improve carbon dioxide removal capacity and
performance.  Perform follow-on bench top evaluations to verify
improvements made to the basic enabling technology.  Modify test setup
and improve test procedures as required.  Develop functional scalable
prototype by incorporating enabling technology into a suitable test bed
(e.g., carbon dioxide storage platform or container). Characterize test
bed performance under an operational relevant range of external
environmental (temperature\/humidity) conditions and in-mask
heat\/humidity loads.  The evaluations should include characterizing the
 breathing air quality, release of any by-products, exothermic
reactions, and other factors relevant to the technology.  Based on
results obtained, implement necessary refinements to the scalable test
bed model.    PHASE III:  Fully integrate solution into a full-scale,
fully-functional prototype containment unit comparable to the size and
weight of a typical re-breather carbon dioxide absorbent and cooling
mechanism.  Demonstrate ability of the technology to be incorporated
into a fully-functional closed-circuit SCBA through modification, where
feasible and appropriate, of an existing off-the-shelf system.  Expand
applications to other commercial markets to include industrial and
homeland defense closed-circuit SCBAs.      PHASE III DUAL USE

industrial, mine rescue, and escape SCBAs.  Other possible applications
include gas purification, gas separation, and underwater breathing

        "topic_name": "Continuous Ionization System for Electrostatic
Collection of Bioaerosols in Building Protection Applications",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a system capable of
continuous ionization of airborne bioaerosols in the 0.5-5 m size range
that does not generate ozone. The system should be designed for use in
electrostatic removal of bioaerosols in HVAC environments at reduced
operational costs compared to HEPA filtration.     DESCRIPTION:
Continually operating, or"always on,"removal of airborne particulates
provides not only day-to-day treatment of air in building environments
but also provides the most rapid response in the event of a biological
contamination event, such as an aerosolized anthrax attack.  These
systems require no sensors or activation delays since they are already
up and running.  Systems currently used for high removal efficiency of
particulate contaminants are limited to fabric filters and electrostatic
 precipitation.  Filters such as HEPA are effective at removing
particles, but induce a large pressure drop (1-6"W.G. depending on
loading) that is expensive from an energy standpoint.  While
electrostatic precipitators are widely used in particulate removal in
flue gas streams, typical ionization methods utilize a corona discharge
that may generate significant (&gt;10 ppm) levels of ozone which is
undesirable in an indoor environment.      Standard air filtration
relies on impaction and interception of particles on filter fibers.
Prolonged use requires cleaning or replacement of filter media.  To
achieve high particle removal efficiencies, more tightly woven filters
are utilized, increasing energy costs associated with the pressure drop
across the filter.  Additionally, filters contaminated with biological
material are hazardous and must be properly disposed of to avoid spread
of contaminants.  Ionization-based filtration processes charge
particulate matter in the air stream which is subsequently collected by
electrostatic precipitation, eliminating the pressure drop associated
with fabric filters.  Ionization of the airborne particulates is
traditionally obtained by corona discharge.  However, work funded under a
 previous SBIR project has demonstrated that an effective ionization
region can be established using an electrospray wick array.  As with
industrial-type electrostatic precipitation systems, it is possible to
remove contaminants without the need to directly contact the collection
surface, thus eliminating the difficulties associated with disposal of
fabric filters.      Electrospray ionization has been used for
laboratory chemical analysis and has recently been proposed for
incorporation into low-pressure drop air filtration units demonstrating a
 potential reduction in O&amp;M costs while providing particle removal
rates similar HEPA filtration. One significant benefit of electrospray
ionization is that ozone is not formed as a byproduct of the process.
Rather than direct ionization of particles by an applied voltage
difference, electrospray induced ionization of airborne particulates is
achieved by charge transfer to the particle from a water based aerosol.
 Implementation of electrospray into"always on"air filtration
applications is currently limited by the lack of reliable,
continuous-feed fluid delivery mechanisms for ionization.      Recently,
 bipolar ionization (BPI) has been demonstrated as an effective method
for charging of indoor aerosols, inducing agglomeration and settling of
particles, as well as destruction of harmful VOCs.  Additionally, BPI
has been used as a charging mechanism for a newly designed aerosol
time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled with a differential mobility
analyzer and charged plates.  BPI can generate high levels of negative
and positive ions in an indoor environment without producing ozone and
has potential for use in electrostatic precipitation applications.
This topic seeks the development of a novel system for bioaerosol
ionization to be used in an electrostatic collection system for building
 protection applications.      PHASE I: Conduct research on ionization
systems that provide uniform and continual delivery of the ions across
the entire volume of influent air.  The system should be designed for
autonomous operation requiring minimal maintenance or user operation
(service less than once per month).  Additionally, power consumption
should be targeted to achieve less than 1.0 watts per cubic feet (35.3
W\/m3) of treated air, to align with Department of Defense goals to
reduce energy costs.  The system should be capable of adapting to
treatment of a high concentration spike of bioaerosols that would occur
during a biological attack.  By the end of Phase I, continual operation
of the proposed ionization system should be demonstrated for periods of
at least one week without losing effective ionization capabilities or
having to replace consumables.  The system should be capable of
operating for at least two weeks without need for maintenance or
replenishing consumables.  It should be able to ionize 2,000 particles
per cm3 at 50 CFM (1.42 m3\/min) to a level adequate for removal of
99.97% of 0.3-1.5 um (micron) diameter particles in a 20 kV downstream
collection region with no measurable ozone generation and minimal
temperature increase (20,000 CFM [&gt;566 m3\/min]) for demonstration at
 an DoD installation or other relevant facility.  Product performance
should be verified to meet the metrics targeted for the bench scale
system.  At this stage, attention should be paid to parameters such as
operational noise, product footprint, and material costs and
modifications made as necessary to increase commercialization and
manufacturing potential.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:
Electrostatic air filtration technology has potential markets both
within and outside of the government for buildings in which there is an
elevated threat of chemical and biological contamination.  In addition,
the technology has the potential to be used in hospitals, schools, and
other buildings where high levels of indoor air purification are desired
 as an alternative to HEPA filtration.",

        "topic_name": "Rapid Sample Transport in Austere Environments",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To develop advanced, innovative
approaches for rapid sample preservation and transport in austere
environments.  Topic objectives include innovative technologies to
enable a low-cost capability to preserve and exfiltrate small medical
and environmental biological samples from austere locations and
precisely deliver the sample to a pre-determined recovery area.  Austere
 locations are defined as remote and typically inaccessible locations.
This capability will be used to exfiltrate medical or environmental
samples from an inaccessible area, perhaps with Chemical and\/or
Biological issues, to enable rapid receipt of physical samples at a
laboratory analysis facility.    DESCRIPTION:  In austere and
inaccessible environments, exfiltration of critical medical, chemical
and\/or biological samples can be difficult.  Lack of maintained
infrastructure, inaccessible or remote locations and other factors can
limit the ability to transport samples from the area of interest to a
location with suitable laboratory facilities.        The Chemical,
Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) sample, which will weigh up
 to approximately two pounds, will need to be packaged to preserve the
sample integrity, and then transported distances ranging from 50 to
1000+ miles to a point within approximately commercial Global
Positioning System (GPS) levels of precision.  Innovative solutions may
choose to focus on part or all of this time\/distance\/weight
performance tradespace -- for instance, lighter packages that travel
shorter distances, or heavier packages that travel longer distances.  At
 the end of the transport, the sample should be able accurately
delivered (commercial GPS-levels of precision) to a pre-determined
and\/or in-route updated location for recovery by ship or by a ground
recovery team.  Transport could take as little as 1 hour or as much as 4
 days from the time the sample is packaged.  The system needs to provide
 near real-time tracking of the sample from initiation to the final
delivery location.  Because this system will be used in remote locations
 and austere environments, a self-contained set-up that can be operated
by non-expert personnel after minimal training is required.    For more
than 50 years, researchers have defaulted to freezing biological samples
 at -20degreesC or -80degreesC as a means of preservation and storage.
It is critical to maintain the integrity and quality of nucleic acids
for use in downstream analysis.  Using current standards for sample
preservation via freezing and shipping with dry ice, proposed approaches
 would be constrained by a requirement to include in an insulated
container approx 7lbs of dry ice for every 24 hours of transport time.
Dry ice mass should be calculated to ensure complete sublimation will
not occur prior to the package arriving at the destination site.
Sublimation is the transition from solid directly to gas since it does
not transition from solid to liquid to gas.  Storing and preserving the
quality of nucleic acids at ambient room temperature would represent a
paradigm shift with significant savings in cost, environmental impact
and ensured sample integrity.  Innovative approaches to room temperature
 sample preservation may be included in the proposed approaches as a
means to extend the performance envelop since this may significantly
reduce the size\/weight limits and the logistics for obtaining dry ice
in austere environments.    The proposed approach should have the
following properties:    1) A basic design architecture and a crosswalk
between the proposed low-cost design approach and key performance
metrics to include end-to-end timeline analysis as a function of payload
 weight and distance.         2) A basic operational construct matched
to the innovations proposed, including proposed or assumed method for
sample preservation, transport, precision delivery, and near real-time
tracking of the sample from initiation to the final delivery location.
    3) A proposed prototype approach that would demonstrate the
capability.  Identification of any specific Government Furnished
Equipment (GFE) associated with future capability demonstration phases
to include possible use of Government test sites.    PHASE I:  Determine
 the feasibility of a low-cost rapid sample transport system for use in
austere environments.  Develop the initial design architecture and a
proposed test event for proof-of-concept.  Identify key system
dependencies and assess global availability of capabilities, like the
use of GPS, SATCOM, weather balloons, air corridor restrictions, etc.
Develop an initial planning tool to support operational capabilities and
 limitations for the proposed innovation.  For instance, if the proposed
 transport mechanism uses a low-cost balloon, then given a specific
sample collection location, the tool would determine viable destination
sites as a function of weather\/wind limited by system range, mass, and
sample viability timeline restrictions.  Down-select to the most
promising technologies for further testing in a realistic environment in
 Phase II.     PHASE II:  Design a prototype system that best integrates
 the proposed components into an optimized system, and demonstrate at
least two sample transport events using two different ranges and payload
 weights.  Update the system planning tool to incorporate initial
demonstration results.    PHASE III:  Develop and perform two overseas
field-demonstration for recovery at land and sea locations.  Analyze
cost-performance trade-offs for low-cost disposable and options for
creation of version sets that are releasable and usable by foreign
national partners while abiding by International Traffic in Arms
Regulations (ITAR) restriction limitations.     PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS:  Enhancements to sample preservation and transportation
have wide applications in worldwide medical surveillance, detection and
response markets.  Other Potential DoD Uses for Technology Innovations:
this capability could also be used for the placement of small sensors or
 unmanned ground systems (UGS) into denied areas.  In this situation,
the system would be launched from friendly territory, such as a ground
location or a boat, and would transport the sensor or UGS into a denied
area.  Once in the denied area, the system would deliver the sensor or
UGS to within ten (10) meters of a desired ground or water location.
The system could also be used to measure and transmit atmospheric data
to provide real-time weather information via a communications link.
Because one operational low-cost construct may be via the use of an
altitude adjustable balloon that drifts with the wind and deploys a
small guided airdrop system for final delivery, then this system could
also be used to return the expensive electronic components of sondes and
 artillery balloons or commercial weather launch systems to allow for
multiple re-uses and to collect weather during assent and descent.",

in the performance of high throughput integrated circuit evaluation and
reverse engineering efforts.  However, synchrotron x-ray sources are
prohibitively expensive (approximately $1B) for commercial and

also been successfully demonstrated, the evaluation time using these

indicate the ability to image several thousand gates using
non-synchrotron sources, but that this would take close to a year to

Control Training System",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop a simulation-based
training system to assist in teaching and training junctional and
non-compressible hemorrhage control. The primary target is existing US
Army \/ DOD military medical special operations training programs, but a
 secondary target could be other government agencies upon coordination
with the government topic manager.  The system could also have
application to medical training programs in the academic and private
sectors. The training audience is"soon-to-be-deployed"medics. The field
of point of injury care is dynamic, but the simulation technologies
applied to improve trauma training are nascent. So, we seek the
development of an innovative, adaptable, and expandable trauma training
system.    DESCRIPTION: Deployed military medics and non-medic soldiers,
 especially those with non- medical functions, are driven on the
battlefield to manage significant junctional and non-compressible
hemorrhage that, until recently, have not been treatable. New adjuncts
have been developed, e.g., Combat Ready Clamp (CROC) and Abdominal
Aortic Tourniquet, but suitable training systems have not.  As a result,
 both medics and non-medic soldiers may be unprepared to use them
proficiently.  Also, medical skills are prone to deteriorate during
deployment.  Thus, both the US Army and other DOD medical training
programs have a need to rapidly refresh skills of soldiers and soldier
medics who are going to, and returning from, forward based assignments.
 Junctional and non-compressible hemorrhage control is a prime example
of traumatic injuries that (1) are rarely seen in non-combat situations
and, therefore, (2) difficult to train for.     This opportunity focuses
 on developing and assessing this junctional and non-compressible
hemorrhage control training system to determine its effectiveness for
training and use in demanding military medical training environment(s).
 The training system must support and respond to non-specific mechanical
 pressure.  This training has a direct impact on the care of our
military personnel, and the criteria for success are weighted toward
systems demonstrating the ability to assist the staff to accomplish
their mission.    We seek a system that:    - is based on established
educational objectives  - includes metrics upon which to judge
proficiency performance  - supports practice of both cognitive and
psycho-motor skills required of medics  - presents multiple trauma cases
 \/ scenarios  - tests the cognitive and psychomotor skills of trainees
at the beginning of training   - identifies deficiencies in cognitive
and psychomotor capability  - tests the cognitive and psychomotor skills
 of trainees at the conclusion of training   - develops a training
program to correct them prior to deployment  - assesses the training
effectiveness of the system   - results in minimal negative impact,
e.g., time, disruption, resources, of the training staff  - improves the
 quality of cognitive and psychomotor training, to teachers and\/or
students  - improves the efficiency of cognitive and psychomotor
training, to teachers and\/or students  - equals or reduces the cost of
cognitive and psychomotor training, to teachers and\/or students  -
addresses virtual mentoring capability with potential to reduce time
required by instructors and students  - is SCORM-compliant  - employs
open architecture principles    Required: Final product must address
junctional and non-compressible hemorrhage control at inguinal injury
sites, pelvic injuries, e.g., groin injuries, and axillary injury sites.
    Optional:  1. Hemorrhage control including target abdominal target
application points, e.g., umbilicus.  2. Team training system that
includes training for all members of a maneuver element, soldiers and
medics.    PHASE I:  Perform a feasibility study and analysis and
develop a concept including discussion of how the system could be
implemented.  Identify the innovative technologies and approach
proposed, technical risks of the approach, as well as the costs,
benefits and schedule associated with development and demonstration of
the prototype.  Identify minimum system requirements and development
tools. Demonstrate the foundational technology for simulation based
junctional and non-compressible hemorrhage control training.    PHASE
II:  Demonstrate the prototype system"s capability to train for multiple
 junctional and non-compressible hemorrhage control scenarios.
Validation of the proposed Junctional and non-compressible and
Non-Compressible Hemorrhage Control Training System is mandatory. Data
from these studies will need to be provided, analyzed, and presented in
the final report.  Report data obtained as a result of the training
assessment.  In the marketing plan section of the Phase II proposal,
include recommendations for effective implementation and estimates of
resources required to operate, maintain and sustain the system into the
future.    PHASE III: This capability is expected to result in a system
with military and civilian wide application to train to proficiency both
 the cognitive and psychomotor skills necessary to treat junctional and
non-compressible hemorrhage.",

        "topic_name": "s Performance Measurement",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To accelerate the integration of
advanced sensor technology into synthetic mannequins to facilitate
objective measurement of user metrics during both training and education
 activities. At the end of Phase I, a proof of concept must be
demonstrated and at the end of Phase II an integrated prototype (Beta)
must be developed and demonstrated.     DESCRIPTION: Mannequins are
currently a common tool for medical training and education. Many of
these have a hard exterior cover and lack adequate and\/or appropriate
modeled internal anatomy and thus may not even be considered for open
surgical procedural training and\/or laparoscopic \/ endoscopic
procedural training. Although these existing mannequins are functionally
 capable of objectively measuring a user"s actions, this functionality
is not adequate for tracking the performance of open procedures. In some
 cases, the space requirements for the sensor and communication
apparatus prevent the user from performing other procedures entirely.
Anatomically appropriate synthetic models have been developed and some
of these have different tissue properties and may possibly serve the
open and laparoscopic surgery community. The structure of these
synthetic models allows trainees to dissect, cut, suture, and
potentially perform a broader-range of tasks than are currently
available on most commercially available mannequin(s). Mannequins which
incorporate synthetic models representing a variety of tissues and\/or
tissue planes that are currently under development require further
functional testing and validation and most still need an expert to
review the novices actions subjectively. One effort that could
accelerate this validation process would be the integration of advanced
sensor technology to track and report on user manipulation of the
specific tissues and connected with the overall systemic model. Existing
 advanced sensor technology is sophisticated enough to allow for the
integration of embedded sensors into these mannequins\/models to
facilitate the measurement and reporting of targeted metrics. The
integrated model as a whole must be reusable and have a high degree of
repeatability of measurement. The sensors employed must provide for
economical use in repeated training exercises either through high
quality, durable components or low cost replaceable ones. The overall
design must support repeatability of measurement in either case. The
integration of the sensors with the tissues must detect dissection of
tissue planes, incisions into\/through tissues, and suturing
(approximation) of the modeled anatomy to name a few. In addition, the
advanced synthetic mannequin should replicate as much of the systemic
human physiological response system as possible (i.e. changes at the
tissue level have systemic affects that should be represented.  Sensors
implemented at the tissue level need to be integrated with other sensors
 and communicate data to and from other systemic sensors to measure and
communicate data and information such as blood pressure, pulse,
respiratory rate, stroke volume, tidal volume, pCO2, renal output, and
glomerular filtration rate to name a few to the end user.  The goal is
to provide as realistic of a human response to interventional procedures
 on the synthetic mannequin as possible while also providing objective
measurement of user metrics during both training and education
activities.     PHASE I:  Deliverable at the end of Phase I: a proof of
concept for integrating advanced sensor technology with the synthetic
tissues\/organs demonstrating the ability to detect several different
parameters including (no particular order) 1) force(s) exerted on the
tissue, 2) direction(s) the force(s) applied, 3) cutting or tearing of
tissue(s), and 4) forces for approximation of tissue.  Must provide
preliminary data relevant to the robustness and repeatability of
measurement of the sensor systems and the synthetic tissue. In addition
to the monthly reports and final reporting requirements, an initial
concept design for an integrated system must be delivered as well. A
Review will be held around the 5th or 6th month at the government site
Fort Detrick, Maryland to present and demonstrate the proof of concept
developed and results obtained to date.  Suggested alternates to sensors
 used during Phase I as well as suggested alternate bio-materials used
for synthetic tissues need to be considered as a part of the research.
   The Phase I proposal must include projected concept and develop key
component technological milestones, have a preliminary methodology on
how analysis of the predicted performance of both the sensors and the
synthetic tissue in addition to items such as working hypothesis,
clinical impact, military impact, technical tasks, research
methodologies supporting the hypothesis, and statement of work. No
trials\/studies needing Institutional Review Board (IRB) during Phase I
will be accepted.     PHASE II:  At the end of Phase II, it is expected
that a fully integrated prototype system (i.e. integration of sensors,
synthetic material with properties mimicking tissue, and software) be
demonstrated and the demonstration is included as a final project
deliverable (i.e. presentation at the government site Fort Detrick,
Maryland).  This integrated prototype system must provide sensing
capabilities at both the tissue and system levels and provide the end
user with objective data regarding the performance of the trainee.
Examples of sensing capabilities are, but not limited to (and in no
particular order), 1) force(s) exerted on the tissue, 2) direction(s)
the force(s) applied, 3) cutting or tearing of tissue(s), 4)
approximation of tissue, 5) occlusion and the release of occlusion of
tissue, 6) application of energy onto the tissue, 7) multiple tools
(hands \/ fingers can be included as"tools"applied to the tissue (such
as the concept of retraction) to name just a few, and 8) measurement
of"fluids"within the vasculature to name a few.     Preliminary
validation of the tissue level sensor and synthetic model is mandatory:
this would include items, but not necessarily limited to, detection of
stretch and how much tension and distance is used on the tissue,
detection of tissue cut and percentage cut (note, need to detect partial
 tissue cuts), tissue approximation and how much tension was placed on
the tissue during approximation, and if tissue has been occluded
(including partial occlusion) and release of occlusion.  Validation at
the systemic level (refers to something that is spread throughout,
system-wide, affecting a group or system such as a body) is optional.
Data from these studies are an anticipated outcome of Phase II and data
should be analyzed, summarized, and presented in the final report.
At the end of Phase II it is also expected that preliminary
specifications on synthetic tissue model are provided, and sensor
specifications are outlined. Preliminary data regarding robustness,
reliability, accuracy, and repeatability is optional as a delivery at
the end of Phase II. Estimated cost for production of prototype based on
 costs of sensors, synthetic tissues, other materials and supplies,
labor, and overhead required to produce the prototype be provided as a
deliverable. Descriptions of preliminary estimated product life and
robustness of synthetic tissues and sensors should be provided, and a
concept of the overview of maintenance should be included in the final
report.    Phase II should also include a preliminary evaluation by
Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). These SMEs should not have been a part of
 the requirements and development and should serve only in the
evaluation portion. These SMEs are not required to be military and\/or
government, but need to be in good standing with their respective
organization and professional society. Evaluation should include
clinical relevance as well and may include content and\/or construct
methodologies. Summary and analysis of data needs to be included as a
deliverable.     The Phase II proposal should include a
commercialization plan\/strategy, including letters of support or
agreements if applicable.  This commercialization plan should include
analyses of customers (types and size), market opportunities and value,
cost estimate of the unit for production and for sale, and projected
company"s sales, revenues or operating loss.      PHASE III:  A fully
robust, ergonomic, cost-effective, manufactured commercialize product
should be developed. Manufacturing capabilities and scale up plans
provided. Test results on robustness, shipping, electrical safety
testing, accuracy, consistency, and repeatability should be included.
Specifications of manufactured product as well as manufacturing process
need to be prepared and finalized. Materials, material properties, and
conditions under which product may be shipped and stored are needed.",

        "topic_name": "Anatomic 3D Synthetic Tissue Printer for Medical
Training",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Create a multi-substrate 3D printer
with the ability to render high-fidelity anatomically accurate synthetic
 physical tissue models that can be used for anatomy, trauma and
surgical training purposes.  It is desired that such simulated tissue
consist of multiple substances with varying physical properties, so that
 bone, muscle, vessels, skin and adipose or organ tissue can be
simulated.    DESCRIPTION: As part of a strategy to lower costs and
reduce the use of animal and human cadaveric tissue, this SBIR intends
to develop 3D printing technology so that anatomically accurate,
multi-substance human tissue analogues can be produced for training
purposes.  The printer should be able to produce several simulated types
 of tissue and deposit them in mixed format; i.e., a sample of printed
tissue could include hard bone as well as compliant muscle, skin and
major blood vessels and perhaps empty spaces within that substrate.  If
such technology were possible, a wide variety of human anatomy sections
could be printed on demand.  These simulated anatomy sections could be
used for surgery rehearsal, visualization, procedural training and other
 uses.  The actual printed substrates should ideally not be actual
biological tissues, but rather materials that simulate their physical
properties.        PHASE I: At the end of Phase I it is expected that a
proof of concept of a 3D printer be demonstrated for multi-substrate
deposition, including detailed data on performance of the concept and
identify anticipated performance of a more sophisticated working
prototype.  It is expected that appropriate stimulants be created and
tested for bone, muscle, adipose tissue, integument (vessels or tissue
planes), skin and possibly organs.  Plans for software to be used in the
 Phase II effort, if the company is selected, should be elucidated.
The Phase I proposal must include proposed concept and identify key
component technological milestones, have a preliminary methodology on
the predicted performance of the printer and printing substrates in
addition to a working hypothesis, research methodologies supporting the
hypothesis, technical tasks, clinical impact, military impact, and
statement of work.   The Phase I proposal must also include a target
end-consumer cost for the printer if it were to be successfully
developed.  Similar cost estimates, with practical examples, must be
provided for consumables needed to produce anatomical sections.
Anticipated resolution must be specified.    PHASE II: At the end of
Phase II it is expected that a working prototype system will be
demonstrated.   The working prototype must work with multiple substrates
 and effectively produce printing outputs that contain at least three
types of tissue and empty space areas.  The task of creating effective
tissue planes (including major vessels) must be definitively addressed.
 Description of plans, if any, to colorize tissue stimulant materials
during printing need to be included in the deliverable     Phase II must
 contain a validation study that examines simulated anatomy output for
use in a medical training setting.  In addition, the Phase II system
must include software tools and anatomy data to allow users to produce a
 variety of simulated tissue sections.  The ability to produce printed
tissue output from data of CT and MRI scans is desired.  A robust
prototype, including 3D anatomy data and consumables, must be delivered
for independent testing. Testing of the prototype needs to be performed
by an organization that has not participated in the requirements or
development. Summary and analysis of data needs to be provided as a
Phase II deliverable.     PHASE III: Fully robust, ergonomic,
cost-effective, manufactured commercialized product. Manufacturing
capabilities and scale up plans shall be provided. Test results on
robustness, shipping, electrical safety testing, accuracy, consistency,
and comparability to current existing methodologies are required.
Detailed product cost and consumable cost information is necessary.
Specifications of manufactured product as well as manufacturing process
need to be prepared and finalized. Materials, material properties,
conditions under which product may be shipped and stored are needed.",

        "topic_name": "Prototype, Open-Source, Universal Healthcare
Exchange Language",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Prototype architecture to execute an
open source, universal health exchange language, as described in a
recent President"s Council Of Advisors On Science And Technology (PCAST)
 Report.    DESCRIPTION: Most DOD, VHA, and civilian healthcare systems
encounter significant challenges in exchanging health information due to
 the lack of a universal health exchange language.  Without effective
health information exchange, continuity of patient care is less than
optimal, healthcare access and availability are hampered, and healthcare
 costs increase.   This topic is of particular importance to DOD, which
is a provider and payer of care for 9.6M beneficiaries. Two thirds of
military healthcare is delivered in the civilian sector.    As a matter
of background, the PCAST Report On"Realizing The Full Potential Of
Health Information Technology To Improve Healthcare For Americans:  The
Path Forward", sets forth general recommendations regarding how
healthcare information technology can be used to improve healthcare
access, availability, acceptability, continuity, cost-effectiveness, and
 quality.  The report cites the beneficial work of the HHS Office of the
 National Coordinator  (ONC) for Healthcare Information Technology in
developing standards and an initial nationwide healthcare information
exchange to share data to improve healthcare delivery and support
research for the public good.  The report points out that"national
decisions can and should be made soon to establish a"universal exchange
language"that enables health IT data to be shared across institutions;
and also to create the infrastructure that allows physicians and
patients to assemble a patient"s data across institutional boundaries,
subject to strong, persistent, privacy safeguards and consistent with
applicable patient privacy preferences."The PCAST report further states
that,"creating the required capabilities is technically feasible, as
demonstrated by technology frameworks with demonstrated success in other
 sectors of the economy. The best way to manage and store data for
advanced health informatics is to break data down into the smallest
individual pieces that make sense to exchange or aggregate. These
individual pieces are called"tagged data elements, because each unit of
data is accompanied by a mandatory"metadata tag"that describes the
attributes, provenance, and required security protections of the
data."Current state: Some research surrounding use of healthcare
metadata is underway and moving from academic labs into some early
practical uses, such as demonstrated by Dr. Parsa Mirhaji for use in
public health surveillance.  Much of this research has been conducted
using semantic web technologies employing the Resource Descriptive
Framework (RDF), and Web Ontology Language (OWL), and query technologies
 such as SPARQL, which utilize the concept of"tuples", (subject,
predicate, object), to relate data and achieve semantic
interoperability.  Other similar technologies exist, such as those from
Metadata, Inc., although the semi-proprietary Metadata language, parts
of which is available from Open Health Tools, is based on quintuplets
vice tuples.  Through their Health Data Dictionary (HDD) product, 3M has
 also supported some degree of semantic interoperability, using a
knowledge representation scheme linked to a unique concept identifier,
but it is not a true first-order predicate logic ontology.  Language and
 Computing, now owned by Nuance, developed LinkBase, the world"s largest
 medical ontology, with limited commercial success.       Adoption of
these commercial technologies may have been limited by their
proprietary, versus open nature, and associated licensing costs.  It may
 be possible for some of these commercial technologies to be made open
source, with companies then selling services around their technology,
but this is a business decision that is up to the companies.  Moving
towards developing open source terminology mediation services may place
these companies in a position wherein the Office of the National
Coordinator for Healthcare IT could adopt those terminology mediation
services for use in the Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN),
and NwHIN Connect and Direct products (typically using a Berkeley
Software Development License).  In any event, the environment is ripe
for continued academic and commercial collaboration under an STTR to
advance the domain.    Desired State:  Research conducted under this
topic will directly support the PCAST and ONC visions, but would be
conducted primarily on behalf of the Military Health System, which
provides an integrated healthcare delivery system for 9.6 million
beneficiaries.  This care is delivered through a combination of direct
care Military Treatment Facilities and private healthcare delivery
organizations under the TRICARE triple option health benefits program.
Nearly two thirds of healthcare is delivered to military beneficiaries
through the private sector.  Given that military families are also
highly mobile, moving on average every three years to new duty stations,
 finding a way to exchange data and create a longitudinal virtual
electronic health record is an important objective of military medicine.
  Clearly the research would also be extensible to other national
publically and privately funded healthcare delivery systems and
information exchanges.      The prototype to develop a universal
exchange language for healthcare information and a digital
infrastructure for locating patient records while strictly ensuring
patient privacy may employ the U.S. Army Telemedicine and Advanced
Technology Research Center"s (TATRC) Early Stage Platform (ESP) for
Research and Development, which provides a fully replicate DOD
Electronic Health Record and CHCS computerized physician order entry and
 results retrieval system for third party development, using virtual
machine access.      TATRC will coordinate this research closely with
HHS, Office of the Nationwide Healthcare Information Coordinator, the
Veterans Administration, and with the Center for Medicare Services
(CMS).  It is fully expected that the research will be extendable into
the public good and will benefit the development of new electronic
health records developed by the private sector that would utilize the
universal exchange language.    PHASE I: In Phase I, the awardee will
outline a strategic, operational, and technical alternatives to creating
 a prototype, open source, universal health exchange language service
that can operate as a service on the NwHIN, and support health exchange
for military medicine.   Phase I work should center on a limited number
of use cases to be determined in conjunction with the government
Contracting Officer Representative.  Phase I will also provide
opportunity for consultation with ONC for Healthcare IT and other
subject matter experts.  At the conclusion of Phase I, the awardee will
recommend a technical reference implementation architecture, which will
then be built as a prototype in Phase II of the SBIR.    PHASE II: In
Phase II, the awardee will build the universal health language
prototype, as an open source service on the NwHIN Connect solution, and
demonstrate the exchange of military, VA, and civilian health data with
semantic interoperability in a laboratory setting, potentially using the
 TATRC early stage platform for research and development.  At the
conclusion of Phase II, the prototype will be demonstrated to U.S. Army
TATRC, Military Health System, HHS ONC for Healthcare IT, HHS CMS,
Veterans Administration, and other government officials.    PHASE III:
In Phase III, the universal health language service would be implemented
 on the NwHIN, or otherwise in local or regional health information
exchanges to support scalable terminology mediation between electronic
health records systems.  Such work may also be commercialized and of
interest to commercial electronic healthcare vendors.  Ideally, the
universal health language service would be an open source service, with
the vendor choosing to sell services around the open technology.",

        "topic_name": "Prototype Application of Mobile, Cloud-based,
Watson-Like Technologies for TBI\/PTSD Clinical Decision Support and
Predictive Analytics",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Explore the use of natural language
and clinical language understanding technologies, combined with IBM
Watson-like technologies, to predict provisional diagnosis, provide
clinical decision support, predictive analytics, and improved outcomes
for mild TBI and PTSD patients. Develop a mobile, cloud-based
architecture that can integrate with existing or improved clinical
workflow, and ties to the Electronic Health Record.    DESCRIPTION: For
more than 30 years, academic researchers have studied the use of
computers to predict diagnoses and make recommendations for treatment.
Such work has developed a number of standards and frameworks for
developing and executing clinical decision support guidelines and
algorithms, such as SAGE, EON, GLIF, and ATHENA. Several commercial
products to couple knowledge with problems, and to predict diagnosis and
 recommend treatments, such as PKC Couplers, Agile Diagnosis, Isabel,
TheraDoc, Zynx, and others, and have emerged on the marketplace but have
 not been widely adopted, perhaps because the clinical decision support
guidelines are typically segregated to one disease domain, and do not
cross domains. In addition, such clinical decision support systems have
not been truly integrated into a clinician"s workflow and\/or into the
Electronic Health Record. Maintaining current medical knowledge within
the algorithms has also posed considerable challenge. The TATRC
Morningside Initiative, started in 2007, was an attempt at a
private-public partnership to create an open source repository of
clinical knowledge.    Two recent developments may change adoption
rates, however. First, Qualcomm has joined forces with X-Prize
foundation to over a $10M prize to any individual or company that can
develop a mobile computerized decision support tool that can diagnosis
patients as good as a panel of board certified physicians. Second, using
 technology that has evolved out of the widely advertised Watson
Jeopardy game challenge, IBM has announced a major collaboration with
WellPoint to use Watson technologies to diagnosis and recommend
treatments for oncology patients. Several key partnerships have formed
between Nuance, IBM, and 3M to apply speech recognition, natural
language processing, and medical ontologies towards development of
improved clinical decision support tools to predict diagnoses and offer
treatment options. A number of companies are also releasing products
that use embedded sensors to collect patient physiological signs, and
include them as input to the clinical decision support algorithms. Some
of these products are smart-phoned based, although research in mobile,
cloud-based technologies is just beginning and is 5 to 10 years from
maturation.    PHASE I: In Phase I, the awardee will develop alternative
 strategic, operational, and technical architectural views for a
clinical decision support aid which can predict diagnosis from patient
history, symptoms, and\/or physiological signs, with a focus on using
mobile, cloud-based speech recognition, natural language processing, and
 IBM Watson-like technologies to capture and analyze data.  Initial use
case will focus on improving outcomes for mild TBI and PTSD patients.
The awardees will work with TATRC and its partners to incorporate
existing, ongoing natural language processing and clinical decision
support work as applicable, and produce a complete design document for a
 clinical decision support tool that will predict diagnoses based on
patient history and symptoms. The government encourages evaluating the
use of cloud-based algorithms which can be executed on mobile devices.
The government also encourages the use of standards based, open source
clinical practice guidelines for execution. To the extent that the
specific pathways can be seen within the algorithm, and are not
proprietary, they can also be used to support training of residents.
PHASE II: In Phase II, one or more awardees from Phase I will build and
test a prototype. TATRC can provide use of a virtualized Early Stage
Development (ESP) platform that can be used in the project, although a
vendor use fee will be negotiated under a CRADA. The ESP platform has
access to a fully functional AHLTA and CHCS development and test
environment. TATRC will also make available open source VISTA code that
the awardees can consider using in the project. TATRC will attempt to
supply sufficient military clinical subject matter expertise to test and
 evaluate the prototype as to clinical relevance, accuracy, and
usability. The awardees should also provide their own clinical expertise
 in addition to what expertise the government may provide.    PHASE III:
 It is anticipated that this research will yield improvements in
application of mobile-based natural language processing, clinical
language understanding, text analytics, computerized algorithms, and
artificial and business intelligence, that may have applicability
outside of the medical domain and may be applied in other domains, such
as military intelligence. The government also expects that this research
 may yield new developments in computerized modeling and simulation to
train personnel in a number of industries.",

        "topic_name": "Cohort Builder for Healthcare Quality Assurance
and Comparative Health Effectiveness Research",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Define and prototype architectural
alternatives resulting in an easy-to use cohort builder for clinicians,
nurses, and QA personnel.  The cohort builder would be used for
conducting quality assurance and comparative health effectiveness
research; to recapitulate findings in the literature; and to remediate
patient care issues for chronically ill patients.    DESCRIPTION: The
mantra of the Military Health System is to deliver available,
accessible, acceptable, high quality, continuous, and cost effective
healthcare to 9.6M beneficiaries.  Each budget cycle the Military Health
 System is called upon to deliver continuously improving healthcare, yet
 has ever-increasing constraints placed on its resources.  In order to
do more with the same or less level of resources, and without adversely
impacting health outcomes and patient safety, the Military Health System
 should engage in comparative health research studies to ascertain which
 treatments provide the best outcomes at equal or less cost than other
therapies.  Additional studies should be conducted to determine why one
clinician may get better outcomes at equal or less cost than his\/her
peers, considering case mix (i.e. clinician profiling).  Yet the
Military Health System does not currently have the clinical analytical
tools to conduct such analyses. Although the Military Health System
(MHS) has a number of Automated Information Systems (AIS) in its
inventory, including AHLTA, Clinicomp Essentris, CHCS, ICDB, MDR, M2,
CDM, HSDW, AFCHIPS, Air Force Population Health Portal, Medical Home
Clinical Data Mart, and others, there is no system that allows
clinicians to build cohorts for quality assurance studies or comparative
 health effectiveness research, and compare those cohorts as to
differences in health outcomes.      In the current state, clinical
quality assurance and comparative health effectiveness research studies
cannot be easily conducted.  Executing such studies requires extensive
expertise in the form of data priests and statisticians, to identify
appropriate data, pull it from the right sources, consolidate it, and
analyze it.  Conducting such studies can take months.  Issues impacting
the care of chronic care patients at the point of care cannot be easily
identified or remediated at the point of care.  Studies in the
literature cannot be re-capitulated in a clinician"s panel in a matter
of minutes.  Of additional concern is the current rapid promulgation of
domain-specific data marts and registries in the new Centers of
Excellence, with no robust toolsets to conduct health outcomes on those
registries.    In the envisioned state, access to information would be
democratized, with no need for data priests or statisticians.
Clinicians, nurses, and QA personnel would access an easy-to-use cohort
builder on their desks, that allows one to quickly build cohorts on any
combination of parameters collected in base transaction systems; which
supports different time events for different parameters; and provides
for risk windows and blackout periods; for the primary purpose of
remediating issues identified in chronic care patients.  In addition,
the cohort builder would be self-documenting in terms of identifying the
 basis for the cohorts, and produce analysis suitable for publication in
 research journals.  The tool would incorporate a statistical service to
 make automated, on the-fly comparisons between cohorts as to
differences in morbidity and mortality. All parameter lists, cohorts,
and outcomes could be saved as objects and reused.  The output of one
study could become the input for another study.      PHASE I: In Phase
I, awardees will outline strategic, operational, and technical
architecture alternatives for a prototype cohort builder to support
health outcomes studies.  The alternatives would include an analysis of
existing GOTS and COTS products and their ability to be integrated into
current clinical intelligence frameworks.  The output of Phase I is a
report that would provide details on the cohort builder would integrate
with existing and planned MHS transactional, data marts, registries, and
 data warehouses, and which would serve as a complete design document to
 actually build a prototype cohort builder.    PHASE II: In Phase II,
the SBIR recipient(s) will build or buy a cohort builder, integrate it
with various MHS data sources, and pilot the tool with approximately 20
clinicians at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, USU, and Centers of
Excellence.  During the prototype, the Phase II recipient(s) would
collect data on the usability of the cohort builder in conducting health
 outcomes studies, and conduct measurements on how the cohort builder
improves the effectiveness and efficiency of outcomes studies over
previously conducted manual efforts.  Any particular studies conducted
would require IRB approval in advance.    PHASE III: Clinical
intelligence and\/or electronic health record vendors that support the
analysis of healthcare delivery in traditional inpatient and outpatient
settings could commercialize this research for use in new markets,
including the life sciences.  Those conducting comparative effectiveness
 of commercial products might even adopt the work outside the healthcare
 of life sciences arena.",

        "topic_name": "Novel Sampling Device for the Surveillance of
Adult Flying Insect Vectors",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a novel freestanding,
lightweight, compact, portable sampling device to collect a broad
spectrum of adult flying insect disease vectors.    DESCRIPTION: Vector
borne disease historically ranks among the leading causes of Disease and
 Injury (D&amp;I) among U.S. service members deployed in support of
military operations. Entomologists perform vector surveillance in order
to mitigate the threat of vector borne disease among military
populations. Vector surveillance provides information on density,
abundance, distribution, and species composition of vectors as well as a
 way to evaluate results of control measures. In order to properly
characterize the threat of vector borne diseases and develop effective
control techniques, equipment used in vector surveillance operations
needs to be highly effective, easily transported, and relatively
maintenance free.  Vector surveillance devices should ideally be able to
 target multiple groups of insect vectors and be self-contained, to
eliminate the need for numerous devices and reliance on external power
or fuel sources.    The CDC light trap was developed in the mid-20th
century and has been virtually unchanged since the 1960s.  It is the
primary piece of equipment used in vector surveillance for adult insect
vectors, such as mosquitoes and sand flies, in military and civilian
vector surveillance and control programs.  Depending on availability,
the CDC light trap is sometimes augmented with carbon dioxide from dry
ice or another source. Unfortunately, even with carbon dioxide
supplementation, this trap does not work well for many militarily
important adult insect vectors, including the vectors of Dengue fever,
malaria, and leishmaniasis.     While the CDC light trap is recognized
to have serious flaws in its ability to provide reliable, accurate
vector surveillance for most adult flying insect vectors, it remains the
 standard trap used by military entomologists during deployments.  As a
component of the U.S. Army Medical Equipment Set (MES) Entomological Kit
 Field (UA 124A), it is fielded to all level II and III Army preventive
medicine assets for operational use worldwide.  Unfortunately, this trap
 has not kept up with the rapidly changing understanding of insect
behavior and improving technology in recent years.     Over the last two
 decades, newer adult flying insect traps have been developed in the
commercial sector in an attempt to provide more effective means of
surveying for important insect vectors.  These newer devices rely on
chemical cues, such as carbon dioxide or other chemicals that are
present in human skin secretions, and\/or different wavelengths of
light.  While some of these new traps, including the Mosquito Magnet, BG
 Sentinel, and Zumba traps, are more effective than the CDC light trap
at collecting certain groups of host seeking mosquitoes, none of these
traps are broadly effective against the variety of flying adult insect
vectors (Bhalala and Arias 2009, Dusfour et al 2010). In addition, many
of the new traps available are not as portable as the CDC light trap and
 still require reliance on external power or fuel sources, ranging from
large batteries to propane tanks.      The DoD Armed Forces Pest
Management Board (AFPMB) has identified the need for new or improved
vector surveillance systems as the most important research priority for
military entomology (AFPMB 2011).  Military vector surveillance varies
from other governmental and non-governmental vector surveillance efforts
 in that military entomologists need the tools to conduct accurate
surveillance in any environment or geographic region to which they may
be deployed.  Furthermore, military entomologists need tools that are
easily transported in order to ensure that they can get them to any
location, no matter how remote, where vector surveillance will be
required.  A vector surveillance tool that is broadly effective,
reliable, and portable will fill a major gap in our ability to
accurately characterize the threat of vector borne disease in military
operations.    The purpose of this project is to develop a novel device
to perform surveillance on adult insect disease vectors. This device
should be attractive to a variety of vector groups, including mosquitoes
 (Anopheles, Aedes, and Culex species) and sand flies (Phlebotomus and
Lutzomyia species). Efficacy against black flies, biting midges, and
tsetse flies would be desirable, but is not the primary focus of this
effort. The trap should be freestanding, lightweight, compact, portable,
 and should not require an external power source. The internal power
source should be DoD Green Energy compliant. The device may be either
one standard piece of equipment that is effective against the broad
range of vectors outlined above or it may consist of a modular design
that can be tailored to the specific group of interest.    PHASE I: This
 phase of the SBIR should focus on developing the initial concept and
design for the surveillance trap.     PHASE II: During the Phase II
portion of this SBIR, the awardee should develop the prototype trap
design. Once the initial prototype is developed, it should be tested in
both laboratory and field environments for efficacy in collecting a
variety of insect disease vectors, such as mosquito and sand fly
vectors. Field testing should include operation in a variety of
environments, including desert and tropical environments. At the
conclusion of Phase II, the awardee should have developed a prototype
that is effective in sampling for mosquitoes (Anopheles, Aedes, and
Culex species) and sand flies (Phlebotomus and Lutzomyia species), is
freestanding, lightweight, compact, portable, and operates without an
external power source.     PHASE III: The proposed SBIR has commercial
applications outside of the military. This sort of novel vector
collection device could be used in public health disease surveillance
programs (both governmental and non-governmental) and by public health
researchers. At the completion of a successful Phase II, the company
should seek funding from either a private company for commercialization
of the product or through advanced development funding. The product
resulting from this SBIR should be considered for NSN assignment so that
 it may be readily purchased by military and other US governmental
organizations. In addition, the product should be considered for
inclusion in the MES Entomological Kit Field as a replacement for the
CDC light trap.  The product should also be commercially available for
other vector borne disease surveillance applications.",

Control",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop and optimize integration of
networked sensors located on torso and appendages of body to assess
accurate center of-gravity and center-of-pressure in real time.
DESCRIPTION: The most frequent and challenging symptom experienced by
military personnel exposed to IED or concussive events is dizziness or
loss of balance (Balaban 2009). Balance is also an issue for warfighters
 who require prostheses to compensate for loss of limbs. Biofeedback
vibrotactile prostheses have recently been developed to assist patients
during recovery while they are undergoing rehabilitation to achieve
unsupported upright posture. (Atkins 2011, Rupert 2010). These sensory
aids receive center-of-pressure (COP) and derived center-of-gravity
(COG) information from static force plates. In order to provide
assistive sensory information during the dynamic condition of walking
without falling, it is necessary to provide real time COP\/COG
information to the assistive device.      Recent advances in
Micro-Electrical-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) have made accessible a
variety of extremely small, rugged, reliable, low power consumption, and
 inexpensive sensors of acceleration and pressure. A collection of these
 devices should be capable of providing similar proprioceptive
information that the distributed biological sensors of the human body
provide the brain to carry out complex mobility tasks. What are the
minimal number, location and type of sensors required to provide
real-time balance information to an integrative device, which with an
appropriate algorithm can provide assistive cueing to prevent falls?
 The technology achievements in MEMS, garments with built in
electronics, and miniaturized short-range wireless transmission now
create the opportunity to efficiently link multiple sensors (e.g.
inertial, pressure, etc) that can provide the basis
for"real-time"COG\/COP information, which can be integrated with
additional sensors and utilized to provide the patient tactile, visual
and auditory cueing systems to enhance balance during dynamic
conditions. This same technology has immediate and obvious applications
to robotics.     This topic seeks proposals addressing both hardware and
 software issues: the hardware must provide sufficient information to
provide real-time COG\/COP no matter how the extremities are being moved
 dynamically in space and the software should be able to predict falls
during dynamic walking conditions.    PHASE I:   1) Develop and
demonstrate a prototype integration of distributed sensors capable of
providing real-time COG and COP for ambulatory human or robot.     2)
Outline plan for software development capable of predicting excursions
outside the normal envelope of walking.     PHASE II:   1) Building on
the prototype from Phase I, test and demonstrate the system hardware and
 the software algorithm developed to predict falls.     PHASE III:   1)
Provide caretakers of wounded warriors with ambulatory device to replace
 current static force plate training and evaluation devices.    2)
Incorporate balance technology into humanoid robotics.",

        "topic_name": "Ear Protection Validation System",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a user-friendly, portable,
universal hearing protection device (HPD) field attenuation estimation
system (FAES) that deployed or garrison personnel can use to measure the
 effective noise protection provided by a hearing protection device or
system that is fit and worn in the field.    DESCRIPTION: It is
generally understood that hearing protection devices typically fail to
provide the protection that is measured in carefully controlled
laboratory tests conducted in accordance with national testing standards
 (e.g., ANSI\/ASA 12.6-2008). Berger (1993) conducted a meta-analysis of
 a number of field noise attenuation measurements and concluded (1) that
 the noise protection (as defined by the protectors"Noise Reduction
Ratings [NRRs]) as seen in the field (i.e., real world) are appreciably
lower than the NRRs calculated from carefully controlled standard-based
laboratory studies and (2) that there is no clear relationship between
the laboratory measurements and the real-world performance of the
various hearing protectors. These two observations are valid for both
insert (i.e., earplug) devices and circumaural (i.e., ear muff) devices.
    Berger (1980) summarizes various reasons why the field measurements
do not meet the numbers obtained in the laboratory (comfort,
utilization, fit, compatibility, readjustment, deterioration, and
abuse). The point is, however, that only highly trained and motivated
users of hearing protection devices can obtain consistent fits yielding
noise protection that approaches that measured in the laboratory.
Furthermore, hearing protection devices are not being employed
sufficiently or properly in the military. Bjorn, Albery, Shilling and
McKinley (2005) conducted a survey of hearing protector use by flight
deck crews on six US Navy capital ships, four aircraft carriers and two
amphibious ships. (Three ships were surveyed from the Second [Atlantic]
and Third [Pacific] fleets.) They reported that only 53% of the flight
deck crew that were surveyed (and who were required to wear double
protection [i.e., earplugs and earmuffs]) wore earplugs and only 7% wore
 their earplugs in a manner to achieve the published 22 dB noise
protection. Thus, the 46% of the Sailors that actually used earplugs
wore them incorrectly.    PHASE I: This topic seeks the development of a
 hearing protection validation system for use by medical or trained
deployed personnel to evaluate the fit and protection of hearing
protection devices. It will provide a single value Personal Attenuation
Rating (PAR), calculate protected exposure levels in dBA, calculate
protected exposure time limits, provide a percent dose estimate, conduct
 testing using a Field Microphone-In-Real-Ear (F-MIRE) technique that
does not modify the hearing protection device, be capable of testing
attenuation of any commercially available device including single,
double, and triple (Active Noise Reduction) hearing protective devices,
complete all measurements bilaterally in 15 minutes or less, be sold at a
 fixed single unit price ($2500 - $3500 range to include computer re:
(2011 prices), use an iPad, tablet or portable hardware and operating
system technology, have little to no consumables, have up-gradable
software, be portable (less than 15 lbs), be ruggedized and durable for
field or deployed use, be capable of data import and export from and to
existing DoD systems, have computer interface capability, have database
extraction and Excel file data transfer modality, be capable of testing
multiple individuals concurrently (up to 8-10), be capable of DoD
service or unit-self calibration, have a color screen display, produce a
 printable report, have an examiner testing menu, have a patient
instructional display screen, provide individualized patient results and
 instructional materials, and be compliant with all current applicable
ANSI standards.    The Phase I deliverable will include an initial
design concept that addresses solutions for at least 80% of the HPD FAES
 characteristics described in the previous paragraph.    PHASE II:
During Phase II, the awardee will implement the best approaches from
Phase I into hardware and software and develop, test, and demonstrate
all of the requirements of the HPD FAES noted above. At the end of Phase
 II, the company will deliver to the US Army Aeromedical Research
Laboratory three (3) field-ready prototypes for laboratory and field
testing. Laboratory testing will include, but not be limited to,
comparisons with hearing protection performance measurement systems such
 as those that adhere to the requirements specified by ANSI\/ASA
S12.6"American National Standard Methods for Measuring the Real-Ear
Attenuation of Hearing Protectors"(2008). Field testing will involve
insertion of the device into an Army hearing conservation clinic and its
 use included as part of the Army Hearing Program (2008).    PHASE III:
The problem of HPD fit and fit verification is one faced by military,
civilian governmental organizations (e.g., law enforcement agencies),
and industry. The FAES developed as a result of this SBIR will be a
valuable tool for all environments (including recreational environments)
 in which noise hazards exist and hearing protection is mandated or
recommended. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration"s (OSHA)
Alliance Program (2008) notes that individual HDP fit verification
testing is an emerging"best practice"trend in hearing conservation
programs. Phase III deliverables will be a validated, ruggedized FAES
that is easily and reliably manufactured and can be utilized in harsh
environments including military forward operating bases, shipboard, and
on factory floors.",

 respiratory effort, and ECG monitoring. It will be demonstrated that
wearable biosensors can be self-powered by harvesting ambient energy or

monitoring, and for monitoring personnel carrying heavy loads or in
high-stress situations, such as monitoring Warfighters health, providing
 support for assessing Warfighter readiness and feedback mechanism for
improving Warfighter performance, and reducing Warfighters"battery load.
 To enable wearable sensors, power on the order of mW must be available
to enable continuous data sampling and processing, and wireless data
transmission [1, 2].  Power that far exceeds those requirements, on the
order of Watts, has been extracted from human gait using shoe, knee, and
 back-pack mounted generators [3-5].  Human energy sources may
potentially provide not only a power source, but also physiological
information [6-7]. In particular, respiratory effort and bioelectricity
are always present energy sources that intrinsically carry rich
physiological information. Respiratory effort available power has been
estimated to be between in the mW range [3, 7]. Innovative solutions are
 being sought to provide and maintain continuous medical and health
support for any operation requiring military service, through deployment
 of wearable biosensors. Minimum accomplishments include monitoring of
at least one respiratory parameter, such as respiratory rate, and at
least one cardiac parameter, such as heart rate. It is required that
sensor will be battery-less, and derive electric energy from ambient
sources or physiological signals.  Ergonomic design embedded in
clothing, continuous (24\/7) operation, and wireless connectivity must
be demonstrated.  Use of a small, light, rechargeable battery is
acceptable.    PHASE I:  During Phase I, technical feasibility of the

for powering wearable biosensors. Required Phase I deliverables will
include initial biosensor concept design, energy harvesting and

wearable biosensor prototype, including ergonomic energy harvesting and
physiological sensing hardware, robust software for physiological
information extraction, and low-power wireless connectivity.    PHASE

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research is to
develop durable, scalable, robust and effective long-term antimicrobial
textile finish.      DESCRIPTION: There is a continuing need for
antimicrobial textiles to provide a range of capabilities  to the DOD.
These include improved hygiene for soldiers via integration into
uniforms to control odor; in medical textiles to control the
transmission of pathogenic bacteria in field medical shelters and
military hospitals.      The goal of this topic is to identify
light-weight, durable, antimicrobial finishes for textiles such that no
degradation of other properties (e.g., porosity, mechanical properties)
occurs.  This is an important component in the overall strategy for
improving soldier performance, and the development of Smart Textiles.
Research will focus on developing and optimizing catalytic antimicrobial
 systems for direct integration into fabric for clothing, shelters, etc.
  The resulting technology should be easily integratable into fabric
weaving and manufacture, and scalable to a high through-put process,
allowing large volumes of fabrics to be treated.    PHASE I: Initial
research will focus on chemical functionalities that can be applied as a
 fabric finish to provide high antimicrobial activity.  Key functional
properties that need to be addressed include non-leaching behavior of
the coating, and an assessment of antimicrobial activity against Gram
positive and Gram negative bacteria.  Application of the finish must not
 lead to significant degradation of other properties (i.e., porosity,
dyeability, printability, durability, mechanical strength, flexibility).
      PHASE II: In this Phase, the process and characterization should
be expanded to include cotton, polyester, and nylon and polyaramid
textiles.  Antimicrobial activity must be determined for coatings on all
 fiber types.  Uniformity of the finish on each type should also be
demonstrated.  Textile properties should be determined using reliable
metrology, and under typical conditions encountered by Soldiers and
after multiple laundering cycles. The final coating and textile must be
characterized to provide data on the extent of coating coverage,
functional group density, coating adhesion, and antimicrobial activity
and lifetime.      PHASE III: This technology will have both DoD and

        "topic_name": "Biosensor and Controller for Closed Loop
Anesthesia Delivery System",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop solution to enable closed
loop anesthesia delivery system that can be used in far forward
operations with regulatory plan for FDA approval, leading to
commercialization of the product for use in the United States.
DESCRIPTION: Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) technique through a
target controlled infusion (TCI) approach is an accepted method of
inducing and maintaining sedation and analgesia in Europe and other
parts of the world, except the United States.  Advantages of TIVA
include improved postoperative outcomes and faster recovery with minimal
 side effects such as postoperative nausea and vomiting. Use of TCI
anesthesia (TCIA) in the United States and in theater of operations for
the United States Armed Forces could improve treatment of casualties
including service members, but it is currently not possible because
there is no FDA approved TCI devices on the market. One of the reasons
for this absence of FDA approved TCI devices stems from a safety concern
 due to the fact that TCIA infusion rates are determined by
population-based pharmacokinetic data and individual patient biometrics.
 Therefore, the exact targeted plasma or effect-site concentration
selected by the anesthesiologist is more art than science (i.e. lacks
precision). Current TCI devices with biofeedback for closed loop control
 of propofol infusion exists, using bispectral impedance brain
monitoring as the biofeedback for example to guide anesthesiologist the
level of consciousness in the patient. Although such method has been
validated in clinical studies and can be used in feedback control
paradigms, there are limitations to bispectral impedance brain
monitoring for closed-loop propofol delivery. Chief concerns include
that the level of consciousness is an indirect measure of the level of
drug in the blood and as such is a delayed biomarker and that bispectral
 impedance brain monitoring does not provide information regarding the
potentially lethal levels of the drug (i.e. acute toxicity). Hence,
inclusion of a biosensor would be one approach that could provide for
direct measured drug levels in the serum and development of an algorithm
 to control infusion rate of drugs in TCI devices would enable automated
 TCIA with minimal additional external devices and monitors that add
more weight and volume, which need to be minimized in the far forward
operations.    The algorithm for correlating blood concentration to
individual pharmacodynamics needs to be accurate and responsive (i.e.
less than 1 second response time) to ensure the appropriate conscious
state is reached without overdosing or under dosing the patient.  The
objective of this SBIR is to solicit for concepts that will enable
automated TCIA system that could also be deployed for use in military
theaters, to include far forward surgical teams and providers. Since
existing TCI devices are already available, the solution should not
include redesign of this component, but should focus on components that
can be easily integrated into existing TCI devices to enable direct
measurement of drug level and automation of the device, minimizing
volume and weight for portability and taking into design considerations
to fit within the environment. Due to the range of variance between
individuals in the normal pharmacodynamics and kinetics of propofol, the
 functional physiologic end point is critical in assessing the patient"s
 conscious state.  Therefore, innovation is also solicited for other
biomonitoring concepts (other than bispectral impedance brain
monitoring) that assess physiological parameters to guide
anesthesiologist the depth of anesthesia whether the concept is used as
an addition, separate, or alternative feedback control to direct measure
 of analgesia, but must address weight, volume, and ease of use to
enable operations in the far forward.    The proposed solution must
account lags whether using physiologic state assessment and\/or
analytics associated with on-line propofol analysis, with less than 1
second response time.  Partnership with TCI device maker is encouraged,
but not required. Designs that can be easily integrated into all or most
 existing TCI devices are preferred.     PHASE I: Conceptualize, design,
 and build a solution to enable closed loop TCIA and test the prototype.
 Required Phase I deliverables will include research design, prototype
with limited testing in demonstrating proof-of-concept in vitro
including performance metrics such as accuracy and sensitivity, research
 plans for preclinical testing, and commercialization strategy including
 regulatory plans. Literature and market review should be done as part
of the proposal background information and not as a task to be executed
during Phase I period. No animal or human use testing is to be proposed
or executed during this 6-month Phase I period due to requirement of
second level DoD review, which generally adds more time beyond the
6-month Phase I period. Travel should be budgeted to government site at
Fort Detrick, Maryland for In Process Review at month 5 or 6 of Phase I,
 where results and deliverables obtained to date be presented before
government subject matter experts, stakeholders, and program managers.
   PHASE II: Demonstrate the proposed closed loop system in preclinical
studies (i.e. relevant large animal model). Required Phase II
deliverables will include design improvements to the prototype based on
Phase I testing, demonstration of the solution in relevant animal model,
 performance metrics of the system determined, and commercialization
plans including regulatory pathway for FDA clearance.     PHASE III:
Phase III efforts should lead to FDA approval and be focused towards
technology transition, preferably commercialization of STTR research and
 development. Efforts leading to FDA approval require execution of Phase
 II plans on commercialization and regulatory pathway, including
identifying relevant patient population for clinical testing to evaluate
 safety and efficacy. The small business should have in plans to secure
funding from non-SBIR government sources and \/or the private sector to
develop or transition the prototype into a viable product for sale in
the military and\/or private sector markets. Commercialization plans
that include the private sector generally help lower cost through
economy of scale.",

        "topic_name": "Drug Delivery System for Topical Treatment of
Peripheral Neuropathy",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a controlled, target-specific
 delivery system for topical treatment of peripheral neuropathy.
DESCRIPTION: Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a painful, debilitating, and
often chronic condition associated with diabetes, cancer treated with
various chemotherapies, and a wide variety of other diseases and
conditions, such as infections, environmental\/toxic exposures,
alcoholism, and extremity injuries. PN is caused by damage to the small
nerve fibers and may occur anywhere in the body, but is most common in
the feet and lower legs. Pain symptoms may include sudden burning
discomfort, electric shock-like sensation, tingling, numbness, and
sensitivity to non-inducing stimuli (allodynia).     The incidence of PN
 in diabetes is estimated as low as 20-25% and as high as 70%. The
incidence of PN is about 30-40% in cancer patients treated with some of
the commonly administered chemotherapeutic agents, including cisplatin
and paclitaxel. In addition to the impact of PN on individuals with
diabetes and cancer, the impact of PN on military and veteran
populations is significant. Deployment-related conditions put military
personnel at risk of peripheral nerve injuries and many other nerve
injuries resulting from trauma, blasts, and exposure to agents or
environmental factors. Pain management for neuropathies is a major
medical concern for military and veteran healthcare. Taken together, the
 prevalence of PN-associated diseases like diabetes and cancer, combined
 with the significant relevance to military and veteran populations,
underscore the need to develop novel treatments for PN.    Currently,
there is no established treatment for chemotherapy-induced PN, and only
two agents (duloxetine and pregablin) are approved by the US FDA for
treatment of diabetic PN. Treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
 drugs (NSAIDs) is common, but is limited due to nonspecificity and
long-term treatment toxicities. The analgesic efficacies of several
other agents in treating PN are being tested in pre-clinical studies and
 clinical trials. While not all-inclusive, the major categories of
systemically administered treatments for PN that have recently been
investigated include: 1) tricyclic antidepressants; 2) selective
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs); 3)
anticonvulsants; and 4) opioids.      Considering the dose-limiting
toxicities of several of these systemic treatments, topical treatment
for PN is a promising, yet underdeveloped area of research and
development. Topical capsaicin treatment has been investigated in
diabetic patients and has shown some evidence of benefit. Topical
lidocaine administered through a patch has also shown pain improvement
in clinical trials done in diabetic patients. Topical treatments
combining antidepressants and anticonvulsants have also recently emerged
 with promising findings in a clinical trial of patients with
chemotherapy-induced PN. Some of the constraints and challenges of
topical treatment development that need to be resolved include skin
penetration and drug permeation, as well as optimum drug dosage for long
 periods to increase efficacy.    This topic seeks to develop a drug
delivery system for a novel topical treatment for PN. The innovative
approach will deliver one or more drugs through the skin and into the
affected area to relieve pain. The drug delivery system should optimize
efficacy and bioavailability of the treatment by integrating a
target-specific and a controlled drug-release mechanism. The delivery
system is also expected have no, or minimal, toxicity. The choice of
drug(s) to be tested should be based on current knowledge and recent
studies on PN treatment.  The system should include a topical
formulation that would be easily applied by the patient or caregiver.
  PHASE I: Phase I work will design and develop the drug delivery
system, and will use in vitro assays to test its feasibility in
transporting the therapeutic through skin. Data will provide
proof-of-concept that the system can be applied topically and penetrates
 through the skin barrier to transport and deliver the drug. An
appropriate skin or skin-like model will be utilized. Parameters
including optimal concentrations and topical formulation, nerve
targeting capability, and controlled release will be defined.
Appropriate controls will be used.     PHASE II: Phase II work will
test, optimize, and validate the delivery system in animal model(s) of
PN to demonstrate the analgesic effects in reducing pain. The FDA
approval pathway should be outlined and considered at each developmental
 stage. Parameters including optimal concentrations, biological
activity, toxicity, nerve targeting specificity, and controlled release
will be defined. In addition, tolerability of the topical formulation on
 the skin will be demonstrated. Validation of success will include the
marked reduction or resolution of pain in the animal model(s). During
Phase II, clinical experts with insight into relevant patient
populations should be consulted as the system is being fully optimized.
Potential commercial and clinical partners for Phase III and beyond
should be identified. Phase II technical proposals should include a
detailed explanation of how the small business will obtain a monetary
return on investment within two years of completion of Phase II (e.g.
through sales, licensing agreements, venture capital, non-SBIR grants).
   PHASE III: If successful, Phase II work will result in a novel
nerve-targeted, controlled release drug delivery system to treat PN.
During Phase III, additional experiments will be performed as necessary
to prepare for FDA review of an IND application. A plan for protection
of intellectual property should be created and executed. A detailed
market analysis will be conducted, an initial clinical application for
the therapeutic system will be selected, and a Phase I clinical trial
will be initiated. Military application: The new therapeutic will be
available to military personnel and veterans who suffer from PN caused
by deployment-related conditions, including peripheral nerve trauma,
infections, and environmental agents or toxins. In addition, healthcare
and quality of life for veterans with diabetes and cancer could also
benefit significantly. Commercial application: Health professionals
around the world could utilize this therapeutic to treat PN caused by
diabetes, cancer chemotherapy, and many other conditions that cause
PN.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop and validate a biometric
model for use by the medical research community to address dismounted
complex blast injury of the pelvis, abdomen, and genitals.
DESCRIPTION: In Afghanistan, military medical healthcare providers have
expressed an interest in providing protection to soldiers to mitigate
dismounted complex blast injury (DCBI). Specifically, they would like to
 provide protection to the pelvic floor anatomical area, the abdomen,
and the genitalia during a blast event such as that seen during the
explosion of an improvised explosive device (IED). The problem was
outlined in Report #8 from the OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF) Field
Assistance in Science&amp;Technology  Medical Team OEF FAST Team 04.
Subject Matter Experts are in the process of collecting data to
characterize the epidemiology of this event. Patient trauma data is
being captured in the Joint Theater Registry (JTTR).    A Pelvic
Protection Working Group (PPWG) was formed, and an abbreviated analysis
of JTTR shows six soldiers were recently wounded in action and sustained
 pelvic injuries. At least two commercial products were identified, and
an evaluation was requested. In April, 2011, the Army Research
Laboratory (ARL) conducted testing using a"sand cannon."These sorts of
tests provide impact forces, but do not necessarily model what
anatomical and physiological damage would result.     Regional Command
(South) (RC(S)) is a multi-national military group that is part of the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. Its
headquarters is located in Kandahar, Afghanistan. In May, 2011, A Joint
Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) was presented to RC(S). The
Project Manager, Soldier Protection and Individual Equipment (PM-SPIE)
is pursuing the evaluation of potential products. The U.S. Army Research
 Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) Subject Matter Experts
(SMEs) are planning to use a thermal manikin for an interim evaluation
of commercial products.    The ARL and USARIEM models are not ideal for
identifying the anatomical and physiologic damage of DCBI to the pelvis,
 abdomen and genitalia that may occur. They will estimate the forces
transmitted, etc. and can be used to provide input data for a biometric
model of the anatomy and physiology of the targeted area. A biometric
model of the anatomy and physiology of that pelvic area is needed. How
well a possible protective solution performs will need to be determined
using this biometric model.     PHASE I: This phase would include
investigation of the epidemiology of the problem. It would include the
design of a concept for the model. This feasibility study would
determine the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and
feasibility of a biometric model for dismounted complex blast injury of
the pelvis, abdomen and genitalia. The Phase I deliverables would
include the results of the epidemiology study and the feasibility study
as well as a validation plan for the model.  The deliverables will be
used to evaluate the readiness to move the effort to Phase II.    PHASE
II: This phase would include modeling and simulation of the three
dimensional aspects of the anatomy and physiology of the area in
question. The model would take force input (blast effect metrics), and
provide some indicator of the resulting tissue disruption. The Phase II
deliverables would include a demonstration of the prototype biometric
model.    PHASE III: Phase III includes the technology transition to an
Acquisition Programs of Record and\/or commercialization of the
biometric model for pelvic injury. Funding will be from non-SBIR
government sources and\/or the private sector to develop or transition
the biometric model into a viable product or service for sale in the
military or private sector markets. The end-state of this research
effort is a validated biometric model of the anatomy and physiology of
pelvic floor injury. There is potential commercial application in the
private sector with regard to blunt trauma resulting from sports injury,
 and the development and design of improved personal protective sports
equipment.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an objective assay for the
rapid and reliable detection\/diagnosis of pain and its intensity for
use with the traumatically injured including the severely cognitively
impaired and sedated patients. The developed assay may include but is
not limited to biomarker, imaging, electrophysiological, and other
physiological and behavioral monitoring techniques.     DESCRIPTION: A
high percentage of evacuated soldiers reported experiencing severe acute
 pain. In a survey of 110 soldiers evacuated from Iraq to Landstuhl
Regional Medical Center between July 2007 and February 2008, 60% of
soldiers reported their worst pain to be severe (seven or greater on a
zero to ten numeric rating scale; Buckenmaier III et al, 2009). Well
managed pain in the battlefield is not only an immediate need to a
suffering injured warrior but may reduce the probability of suffering
from chronic pain (Perkins and Kehlet, 2000). For reasons not completely
 understood, many soldiers will be afflicted with chronic pain.
Complicating the treatment of these patients is the high co-prevalence
of chronic pain, posttraumatic stress disorder, and persistent
post-concussive symptoms. Despite the numerous treatment options that
have been developed for acute and chronic pain management, the treatment
 of pain often requires a multimodal approach that is individually
tailored for the patient.   The ability of health care workers to
rapidly and reliably detect and measure the intensity of pain among
patients that cannot reasonably"self-report"would provide a great
advantage for managing pain and for the objective evaluation of
treatment options.     PHASE I: Required Phase I deliverables will
include identifying the measures of pain and designing the plan for
practical development of the proposed assay.    PHASE II: Required Phase
 II deliverables will include the development, testing and demonstration
 of a prototype assay based on the finalized design from Phase I.
PHASE III: The contractor should identify a market for the requested
effort outside of the parameters of this initiative. A commercialization
 plan should be described including intended market, design and
fabrication requirements, marketing plan, and distribution concept.",

        "topic_name": "Development of Technologies that Control Scar
Contracture after Burn Injuries",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this effort is to
design a new innovative technology to intervene during the wound healing
 process (i.e. inflammatory, proliferative and\/or remodeling stages) as
 to attenuate\/control scar contracture and retain skin aesthetics
following deep tissue burn injuries.    DESCRIPTION:  Here we recognize
450,000 burn injuries requiring medical occur in the U.S. each year.
Approximately 55% of 45,000 of acute hospitalizations cases require
admission to specialized burn units for treatment.  Burn injuries also
complicate approximately 5% to 10% of contemporary combat casualties not
 returned to duty within 72 hours.  Military combat casualties may be
complicated by burn injuries that comprise deep partial thickness, or
second degree burns, to full thickness, third and forth degree burns.
Re-epithelialization after injury often results in the formation of
scars which may subsequently lead to contracture.  A contracture scar is
 a permanent tightening of the skin where normal elastic connective
tissue is replaced with inelastic fibrous tissue.  Primary skin
contractures are common and are the result of the destruction of skin,
subdermal fat and fascia.  Secondary contractures involve muscles and
tendons and inhibit their mobility and may also result in nerve damage
or degeneration.    Current treatment options for scar contracture may
involve over-the-counter treatments, steroid injection or even surgical
intervention.  The unmet needs lie in scar prevention or, in the case of
 scarring, the prevention of resultant scar contracture.  It is
envisioned that proposals will focus efforts on early intervention
during the wound healing process, thereby preventing scar formation, or
after scar formation has already occurred as a scar remodeling strategy.
       PHASE I:  Conceptualize and design an innovative solution for
inhibiting scar formation or subsequent contracture following burn
injuries. The required Phase I deliverables will include: 1) a research
design for engineering the proposed therapeutic and 2) A preliminary
prototype with limited testing to demonstrate in vitro proof-of-concept
evidence (to be executed at Phase I). Other supportive data such
resulting from in vivo proof-of-feasibility studies may also be provided
 during this 6-month Phase I period.      PHASE II:  The researcher
shall provide demonstration of solution in relevant animal model,
performance metrics, and commercialization plans including regulatory
pathway for FDA clearance design, develop, test, and demonstrate a
prototype therapeutic that implements the Phase I methodology to prevent
 scar formation and facilitate wound healing at a burn injury site
during this two year Phase II period. The researcher shall also describe
 in detail the plan for the Phase III effort.    PHASE III:   Plans on
the commercialization\/technology transition and regulatory pathway
should be executed here and lead to FDA clearance\/approval.  They
include: 1) identifying a relevant patient population for clinical
testing to evaluate safety and efficacy and 2) GMP manufacturing
sufficient materials for evaluation. The small business should also
provide a strategy to secure additional funding from non-SBIR government
 sources and \/or the private sector to support these efforts.
Military application: The desired therapy will allow military
practitioners to apply the therapy.  Commercial application: Healthcare
professionals world-wide could utilize this product as a therapy meant
to improve the standard of care presently available to burn patients.",

        "topic_name": "Numerical Model of Variable Surface Roughnesses
for Parasite Drag Estimation",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop a numerical model for
variable surface roughness distributions that can be implemented into
computational fluid dynamics simulations for the estimation of the
parasite drag of an aircraft.    DESCRIPTION: Surface roughness can be a
 significant contributor to the drag of an immersed body such as an
aircraft [1]. Current Army aircraft can employ a number of materials,
paints and protective coatings over the wetted surfaces of the vehicle
that can have significantly different surface compositions and textures.
 Exposure to harsh environments and sunlight can cause oxidation of
paints and protective coatings and corrosion of metals which roughen the
 exposed surfaces. In addition, the effects of roughening and scouring
due to rain and sand abrasion can alter the roughness characteristics of
 leading edge surfaces. The resulting differences in roughness height
result in changes in parasite drag [1], which ultimately affects the
performance and operational capability of the aircraft through engine
power required for flight.     Current computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) methodologies are not able to geometrically simulate surface
roughness with respect to the time and computational resources typically
 available for engineering drag estimation of complex shapes. Rather,
the fluid dynamic effects of surface roughness are approximated through
turbulence models [2,3], transition models [4], or wall functions [5,6].
 These roughness models typically assume a single characteristic surface
 roughness applies over the entire body [7]. This assumption can result
in an over- or under-prediction of the aircraft"s true aerodynamic drag,
 depending on the cumulative relative differences between the assumed
roughness and the actual distributed roughnesses.    The objective of
this topic is to advance the state-of-the-art CFD in aerodynamic drag
estimation due to parasite drag contributions from variable surface
roughnesses, such as glasses, bare metals, protective coatings and
paints. The desired ultimate end-product will be a numerical model that
can be implemented into CFD software to estimate the parasite drag for
an Army aircraft for flight within its design envelope.  Equivalent
sand-grain size roughness for the applicable surfaces would range from 0
 to 200 microns. The ideal numerical model would cover a range in Mach
number from the subsonic to the transonic regime, and would be
applicable for a range in Reynolds number up to the tens of millions
(O(10^7)). In the ideal implementation, the model would interact with a
CFD solver through a boundary condition interface rather than requiring
highly refined computational meshes that approximate the rough surfaces.
 This boundary condition interface could involve such physical
characteristics as equivalent sand-grain sizes and concentrations.
PHASE I: Identify innovative methods for modeling variable surface
roughness distributions in computational fluid dynamics simulations
utilizing current engineering-practice CFD meshes. Provide preliminary
verification and validation approaches to support the activity. Identify
 the experimental data sets that will be used for validation.    PHASE
II:  Develop and implement software modules implementing the new
roughness model consistent with a component or system level flow
simulation tool. Demonstrate the level of accuracy improvements in
aerodynamic drag estimation and additional simulation cost in applying
the model. Incorporate the model into current state-of-the-art CFD
simulation tools useful for complete air vehicle aerodynamic drag
estimation.     Phase II deliverables may be subject to International
Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) control for the algorithmic
implementation of the numerical model, dependent upon any previously
existing distribution limitations for the CFD software into which the
numerical model is integrated.    PHASE III:  If successful, the end
product will be a numerical model for variable surface roughness
distributions that can accurately estimate parasite drag for purposes of
 engineering analysis. For both military and civilian applications, this
 numerical model will be applicable for implementation into
production-level CFD codes for estimating the total drag of a complete
aircraft, as well as the constituent components of the aircraft. The
accuracy of the aircraft drag estimates will be such that the results
from the CFD simulations can be used as the basis for total aircraft
aerodynamic performance estimation, estimation of engine power required,
 and to provide aerodynamic force and moment inputs to other engineering
 disciplinary tools such as computational structural mechanics and
dynamics analysis software packages.     In addition, military
application of the model will allow evaluation of aircraft performance
degradation due to deployment in regions of the world with high
probabilities of surface roughening due to sand, rain and other
environmental factors. The model will then allow for trade-off studies
on the effect of different protective coatings versus operational
capability impacts from aerodynamic drag.",

        "topic_name": "Advanced Seal Technology for Helicopter Drive
System Application",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate advanced high
 speed seals for helicopter drive system application.  The objective is
to develop low cost, low friction, high speed seals as an alternative to
 existing seal technology.      DESCRIPTION: There is currently a need
in the Army for advanced seals in helicopter gearboxes.  These seals are
 used to keep fluids from escaping the gearbox.  The helicopter industry
 has typically used carbon face seals for high speed (surface speed)
applications.  These carbon face seals require cooling and a lubricant
supply.  They also have a low tolerance for misalignment and a low
tolerance to debris on the sealing surface (i.e. grit on the face).
Large diameter magnetic face seals are also used in the industry, and
have problems with being very temperamental and causing significant
leaks.  Elastomeric lip seals are also used, but are limited in high
speed applications, create sleeve wear, and generate heat.
Experience has shown that seal failure is one of the leading drivers for
 gearbox removals.  These failures impact not only costs, but also
availability of aircraft.  In order to reduce the occurrence of seal
failures and improve aircraft reliability, an improved seal is needed.
This topic seeks an innovative solution or a new approach in design in
order to improve gearbox seals beyond the state of the art.  The
technology should be designed to be affordable, scalable and capable of
application across multiple Army helicopter platforms. Minimal impact on
 the existing gearbox hardware is desired.    The development,
demonstration, and validation of a gearbox seal is required for this
topic.  The specific seal locations targeted for this topic are the:
main gearbox shaft seals, nose gearbox shaft seals, intermediate gearbox
 shaft seals, and tail gearbox shaft seals.  The proposed improved seal
does not have to be developed for implementation in all locations, but
the proposal must state the specific location targeted for development.
 Due to high shaft speeds, the proposed seal should be capable of speeds
 between 5,000 to 13,000 RPMS.  Shaft diameters vary, and the seal
design should be scalable between 2 to 5 inches.  Due to the high
temperature environment, the proposed seal design should be capable of
temperatures up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.  Performance parameters can
be established through models and\/or experiments that would lead to the
 construction and demonstration of a seal to validate these parameters.
     PHASE I: During Phase I, the contractor shall design an improved
gearbox seal for the proposed location.  Specific metrics of this design
 are that it must be capable of speeds between 5,000 to 13,000 RPMS, be
scalable between 2 to 5 inches, and be capable of withstanding
temperatures of 500 degrees Fahrenheit.  At the end of Phase I, the
contractor shall demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept.
This feasibility demonstration can be done through the use of modeling
and simulation, or a prototype test.  Experimental data (from testing)
of materials and\/or components should be provided to demonstrate that
the proposed concept meets the metrics.         PHASE II: The contractor
 shall further develop the prototype seal based on the Phase I effort
for implementation on a relevant hardware platform.  Offerors are
encouraged to work with an Army helicopter OEM to tailor their design
towards a specific application, and improve the chance for transition.
The capabilities of the advanced seal will be validated by conducting
additional bench or rig testing.  This testing may be on a rig of the
offerors choosing, but access to a Government test rig will not be
provided.      PHASE III: This technology could be integrated in a broad
 range of military\/civilian aircraft where high speed seals are used.
The potential exists to integrate and transition this system into
existing and future Army gearboxes, such as those for the Apache,
Chinook, Black Hawk, and Kiowa Warrior. This technology should also be
applicable to ground platform PTOs and pumps.",

        "topic_name": "Selective Ammunition Feed System for Machine Guns
 and Auto Cannons",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a compact, lightweight,
high-rate ammunition feed system that will enable an airborne machine
gunner to select a specific type of round for a particular shot. This
will allow efficient use of rapidly evolving , force multiplying"smart
rounds"including precision guided munitions, as well as current
ammunition.  Benefits include improved lethality, reduced collateral
damage, improved vehicle performance due to reduced ammunition carriage,
 efficient use of expensive smart rounds, and potential for application
across many vehicle and high-rate-of-fire weapon types.    DESCRIPTION:
Modern sorting systems take advantage of non-contact sensors, advanced
computer algorithms, and precision actuation systems to sort
heterogeneous items quickly and accurately. Mail, packages, luggage,
farm produce, and manufactured components are commonly sorted in a
highly efficient manner using such systems (reference 1).
Microelectromechanical (MEMs) technologies and high speed digital
communications are enabling the development of"smart"rounds for small
caliber (12.7  30 mm) weapons (references 2a  2e). These smart rounds
and specialized rounds are force multipliers but are expensive compared
to typical rounds (references 2b, 3) and must be used judiciously.
Military vehicles, as well as stationary ground emplacements, use
machine guns and autocannons as offensive and defensive weapons.
Current gun systems typically feed rounds from magazines or ammunition
belts which are loaded with predetermined mixes of various munitions,
e.g. ball, high explosive incendiary (HEI), tracer, etc. These mixes are
 always a compromise and may not be optimum for a particular engagement.
  Introducing additional \/ custom mixes becomes a logistical burden.
Some guns use dual feed mechanisms (M242 Bushmaster) to enable more
flexibility in selecting rounds, but that approach is clearly limited in
 growth capability.     If shooters are to use smart rounds in an
effective and affordable manner, weapon systems must have the ability to
 load a specified round at a particular time. Certain large caliber, low
 rate-of-fire weapon systems have developed robust selective feed
systems (reference 4), but no such systems exists for the small caliber
weapons commonly used on aircraft, boats, and light vehicles. Previous
efforts to address this issue have had limited success, achieving
operationally representative 325 rounds\/minute loading rates but
suffering from heavy, immature mechanisms prone to jamming (reference
5).    A successful Smart-Feed system has application across a broad
spectrum of weapon systems and portable sorting systems.
High-rate-of-fire weapons ranging from 12.7mm machine guns, to
20\/25\/30mm auto cannons, to 40mm grenade launchers are likely
candidates based on currently active smart round development programs
(references 2a  2e). Such weapons are widely used on ground vehicles,
helicopters, boats, and in ground emplacements by militaries and civil
authorities around the world. A smart feed system would also enable the
use of a turreted gun to deploy programmable countermeasure flares in
any pattern desired rather than being restricted to finite sectors as is
 done today. Smart-Feed technology would enable high-speed, portable
sorting \/ dispensing systems for commercial applications such as; in
medical research labs where space is limited and hundreds of identically
 shaped but uniquely labeled specimen vials must be meticulously
manipulated, or in mobile \/ emergency distribution sites where filling
of customized supply orders or routing of packages could be done at
high-speed from varied stocks of standard sized item containers.    The
present Topic will concentrate on the development, integration, and
demonstration of a selective ammunition feed system (Smart-Feed) for
machine guns and auto cannons such as those commonly used on Army
helicopters. Key capabilities of the system will include; near real-time
 inventorying of rounds, reliable and accurate mechanization of
ammunition selection and feeding, lightweight and compact configuration,
 speed of operation in continuous and burst modes, and safety of
operation. The fully provisioned Smart-Feed system shall impose no
penalties for space, weight, and power when compared to current
ammunition storage \/ feed systems.     PHASE I: Demonstrate feasibility
 of system. The awardee shall; create a conceptual design based on the

between failure    Smart-Feed will use the existing feed chute
interfaces on the M230 chain gun (reference 7). The Government will
provide technical drawings as required. A particular challenge is how to
 deliver the selected round(s) from the magazine to the feeder at the
gun turret. Specification of the desired type of round, corresponding
fusing parameters, and rate of fire will be done by a system other than
the Smart-Feed system. Interaction with the"smarts"of each round (i.e.
setting fusing, arming, initializing parameters) will be done by a
system other than the Smart-Feed system and need not be demonstrated.
Communications between the aircrafts fire control system and Smart-Feed
need not be addressed under the Phase 1 or Phase 2 efforts. Rounds are
randomly loaded into the ammunition carriage container.    PHASE II:
Demonstrate proof of concept. The awardee shall; design and build a
Smart-Feed system for the AH-64D chain gun, demonstrate key capabilities
 in a benchtop environment, employ M848 dummy rounds for all
demonstrations. Other types of M230 ammunition shall be simulated by
repainting dummy rounds with appropriate color code bands. Efforts
result in a TRL 4 system.    PHASE III: The Smart-Feed technology will
be validated in a ground-based live-fire demonstration, thereby
resulting in a TRL 6 system ready for subsequent integration onto
specific military boats, ground vehicles, and helicopters.      The
awardee shall design and build a Smart-Feed system compatible with the
mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, and digital communications interfaces
 of the AH-64D helicopter. The system shall be live-fire tested on the
ground using a Government furnished test stand or aircraft including an
AH-64 gun turret. Operating commands (inventory status, type \/ number
\/ rate of rounds to be delivered, etc.) shall be provided to the
Smart-Feed system in a digital format compatible with that of the AH-64,
 but need not be generated by the aircraft.    The basic technology for
lightweight compact commercial sorting \/ dispensing products will also
have been proven. Adaptation of the technology will enable portable
systems useful in temporary or emergency instances where customized
logistics supply orders must be rapidly and accurately built up for
distribution. Customized orders for medical supplies, food, tools, or
hazardous waste response supplies could be rapidly dispensed onsite from
 pre-stocked trucks, thereby reducing response times and reducing
potentially critical errors.",

        "topic_name": "Low Cost Cockpit head tracking and gestural
recognition",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a system to track pilot head,
 hand, and arm positions and movements in a rotorcraft cockpit using
advanced human-machine interface technology like those used in gaming
systems to identify gestures, movements, and head tracking (approximate
eye aim-point).    DESCRIPTION: Current Head Position Sensing systems,
like those on Helmet Mounted Displays like the Apache IHADSS, pose a
significant challenge and so tend to be a rather high cost component to
install and maintain. HMD designs must sense the elevation, azimuth and
tilt of the pilot's head relative to the airframe with high precision
even under high"g"maneuvers and during rapid head movement. Two basic
methods are used in current HMD technology - optical and
electromagnetic. Optical systems employ infrared emitters on the helmet
(or cockpit) and infrared detectors in the cockpit (or helmet), to
measure the pilot's head position. The main limitations are restricted
fields of regard and sensitivity to sunlight or other heat sources.
Electromagnetic sensing designs use coils (in the helmet) placed in an
alternating field (generated in the cockpit) to produce alternating
electrical voltages based on the movement of the helmet in multiple
axes. This technique requires precise magnetic mapping of the cockpit to
 account for ferrous and conductive materials in the seat, cockpit
sills, and canopy to reduce angular errors in the measurement. Current
aviation HMD designs use the pilot's eye aimpoint (actually head angle)
as a pointing device to give aircrew the ability to target nearly any
point in the environment seen by the pilot. These systems allow targets
to be designated with minimal aircraft maneuvering, minimizing the time
spent in the threat environment, and allowing greater lethality,
survivability, and pilot situational awareness.(1)     New technology
from the gaming world has the potential to substantially reduce the cost
 of adding head tracking to conventional helicopters, as well as the
ability to do body tracking and gesture recognition to support future
intelligent cockpits. In Nov 2010 Microsoft released the Kinect for
Xbox, and it became a sensation holding the Guinness World Record for
being the"fastest selling consumer electronics device". The Kinect
provides 3 basic capabilities: advanced gesture recognition, facial
recognition and voice recognition. Soon after its release, open source
drivers for the Kinect were released which spurred an avalanche of
application development by third party developers. Applications include
3D mapping, browser control, motion controllers, 3D teleconferencing,
and basic visual SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping). The
Kinect has a range limit of 1.23.5 m (3.911 ft) and an angular field of
view of 57 degrees  horizontally and 43 degrees  vertically. The Kinect
can simultaneously track up to six people, including two active players
for motion analysis with a feature extraction of 20 joints per player.
The depth sensor consists of an infrared laser projector combined with a
 monochrome CMOS sensor, which captures video data in 3D under any
ambient light conditions. Similar technologies are being developed by
other game system developers (PS2 Eye Toy, etc.) and by other companies
with similar application (head tracking and gesture recognition) and are
 indeed applicable to this effort.     Head tracking, along with gesture
 recognition, has the potential of being an integral part of future
advanced\/intelligent cockpit technologies enabling abilities like
helmet\/head\/face tracking, virtual controls and displays, pilot
physical status assessment (consciousness\/fatigue\/tunneling\/injury),
cockpit damage, and identifying objects\/areas of interest internal and
external to the cockpit using head tracking,     On an aircraft its
potential applications include both cockpit and passenger cabin, with
the main area of interest being the cockpit. The ability to track a
pilot's head to determine what he is looking at is one of the main
tasks. This can be used to estimate current object of interest, help
identify when a pilot is becoming overly focused on a single display or
control (cognitive tunneling), and identify areas\/locations of interest
 to the pilot, for example, when reacting to threats.     The primary
focus for this effort will be to determine the feasibility of using
gaming or other low cost technologies like the Kinect in a modern
cockpit and adapting it into an application suitable for Army helicopter
 cockpits and other aviation systems. Key questions to be answered by
this effort include: 1) can the gaming technology be adapted to work
within the physical environment of an aviation cockpit and\/or cargo
bay; 2) What is the impact on the overall cockpit (electromagnetic
interference (EMI), SWAP (space, weight, and power), avionics system
integration, mounting, reliability, impact on other systems like night
vision goggles, system airworthiness, etc.); 3) what modifications to
the system are needed to make it applicable to Army aviation; and, 4)
what is the overall performance and accuracy of system in head tracking,
 motion\/body tracking, face recognition, etc. Other issues to resolve
are how many systems and how best to arrange them to support different
cockpit configurations and the ability of the system to self calibrate
and compensate for variation in the cockpit environment. Ultimately the
feasibility of such a system needs to be verified in a true cockpit
environment.     PHASE I: Assess the feasibility of using head and
gesture tracking gaming technology in a cockpit environment, to include
assessing body mapping accuracies, fidelity of gesture recognition, and
overall system ruggedness. Develop a concept for integrating a system in
 a variety of cockpit configurations (side-by-side and tandem). Conduct
proof of concept testing for key subsystems to validate that a viable
system can be integrated into a cockpit.     PHASE II: Develop software
to do body tracking and gesture recognition. Build a prototype system to
 track body movement (especially head) and recognize various mission
relevant gestures and support human machine interactions in a cockpit
mock up. Conduct testing to assess the software's ability to determine
what the pilot is doing, what controls and systems he is interacting
with, and what is his primary interest (specific screen of control
inside the aircraft or where outside the vehicle he is looking) in
real-time. The offeror shall integrate a breadboard system into a
surrogate commercial cockpit and demonstrate its functionality in a
flight.     PHASE III: In follow-on research the offeror needs to work
with an army rotorcraft manufacturers to integrate the system into a
army cockpit. Additional efforts will also be required to integrate this
 technology with cockpit software and interfaces that can utilize the
information from the system to interact better with the pilot.     This
system would have key applications to both commercial and military
cockpits with greatest impact on those systems that do not have head
tracking capabilities like the Blackhawk, Kiowa Warrior, and Chinook.
Besides being applicable to aircraft cockpits, this system would also
have application to almost all ground vehicles, C2 Vehicles, even fixed
workstations: any work station where an operator is interacting with
displays and control. Commercial application for such a ruggedized
system are nearly endless and would include: monitoring vehicles and
facilities for home land security and industry at large; a variety of
automotive, trucking, commercial airline, etc. for monitoring operator
status; and support aiding systems, and monitoring safety in shops,
hangers, construction sites, etc.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a lightweight agile motion
base having a high axial load capacity and capable of high precision
pointing over a small range of angular displacements. Such a mechanism
would enable lightweight stabilized mounts for the forward firing
weapons and laser designators used onboard military aircraft and ground
vehicles.    DESCRIPTION: Problem: Military helicopters such as the
MH-6, OH-58, UH-1, MH-60M DAP, and ARH-70 employ fixed forward firing
machine guns and auto cannons as weapons. These installations are
lightweight and simple, but require the pilot to point the aircraft with
 high precision in order to hit their targets. Many ineffective rounds
are expended due to unexpected motions encountered in the dynamic flight
 environment of combat.  Turreted systems such as that used on the
AH-64, and pintle mounted systems such as used in the doors \/ windows
\/ ramps of AH-1, UH-60, CH-47, CH-53, and V-22 allow off-axis shots but
 are an order of magnitude heavier than fixed gun mounts and are also
subject to wasted rounds due to aiming errors during dynamic flight. The
 wasted rounds mean heavier ammunition loadouts are required to do the
mission, and also increase the risk of collateral damage.     The
standard of performance for aerial gunnery from an OH-58D is to achieve
at least one hit out of 70 shots fired at a wheeled vehicle between 800
 1200m distant (see ref 1). This improves to one hit in 30 shots for the
 AH-64 with a stabilized gun turret using current technology. Some
OH-58D flight crews consider their machine guns to be area suppression
weapons rather than point target weapons, preferring to use expensive
guided missiles (see ref 2) in order to minimize collateral damage (see
ref 3).    Modern technology enables highly accurate stabilized weapons
turrets by incorporating direct-drive brushless stepper motors,
lightweight and stiff composite gimbal assemblies, and computerized
stabilization \/ fire controls (see references 4-6). However, these
gimbal \/ motor assemblies are still too heavy for application as
stabilized mounts for forward firing guns.     Payoff: The resulting
Agile, Small-deflection, Precision (ASP) Motion Base would serve as the
heart of a stabilized mount for forward firing weapons. Such a mount
would allow precision pointing of the weapon throughout the firing
sequence, reducing the number of shots required. Fewer shots required
results in more stowed kills per loadout, or lighter weight ammo loads
with a corresponding improvement in   aircraft lift and reduction in
sustainment costs.  Fewer round fired also minimizes the risk of
collateral damage.    Technical Approach: The ASP motion base should be
capable of small (7 degrees ) azimuth and elevation deflections at low

Recuperators for Small Turbine Engines in Army Unmanned Aerial Systems",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate lightweight,
high effectiveness, low cost recuperators for small turbine engines to
power small manned and unmanned aerial systems for increased reliability
 and operational capability.     DESCRIPTION: Tactical requirements for
Army manned and unmanned aerial systems are exceeding current
capabilities for performance (payload, range, time on station),
reliability, maintainability, and supportability. Mission requirements
such as increased power, extended endurance, low altitude
maneuverability in urban environments without detection, and high
reliability are becoming paramount. These requirements are currently not
 fully realized with conventional rotary, internal combustion, or
turbine-based propulsion. Electrical power requirement for advanced
payloads is also increasing, which adds weight to the air vehicle.
Turbine based propulsion systems offer improved power to weight ratio
over typical internal combustion engines, however, do not compete well
in fuel efficiency in small size engines due to increased clearances and
 losses. The addition of recuperation can improve small turbine fuel
consumption across the operational spectrum, such that it is competitive
 with internal combustion engines. This would allow Army manned and
unmanned aerial systems to take advantage of the turbine engine"s
inherent reliability and durability, while reducing the weight advantage
 somewhat. Therefore, for a successful recuperated small turbine engine
(30-700 horsepower) to be developed for application to Army manned and
unmanned aerial systems, it will be critical for the recuperator to be
lightweight, have high effectiveness for good fuel consumption
characteristics, use low-cost manufacturing techniques, and be
durable\/reliable so that overall engine performance, cost, and
reliability\/durability is achieved. The objective of this topic is to
develop lightweight, high effectiveness, low cost, and durable\/reliable
 recuperators for small turbine engines, which offer potential for
increased engine power to weight ratio and reliability, in order to meet
 current and anticipate future needs of Army manned and unmanned aerial
systems. Current conventional engines are sized to provide enough power
and speed for takeoff capability, often leading to a propulsion system
which operates inefficiently at other operating conditions. An advanced
recuperated propulsion system would need to be able to meet different
operational requirements of a small\/mid-sized manned and unmanned
aircraft, which include full power takeoff capability, high part-power
cruise fuel efficiency for improved endurance, and quiet operation
capability. Additional capabilities required for both Army manned and
unmanned aerial systems include the ability of the engine to operate off
 of heavy-fuel (JP-8, diesel) and ability to provide power to electrical
 payloads.     PHASE I: During Phase I effort, key components of the
proposed recuperated engine concepts should be developed and validated
to substantiate the ability to provide a lightweight, high
effectiveness, low cost, and durable\/reliable recuperator that can be
integrated into a current or future turboprop\/turboshaft engine system.
 A lightweight recuperator design will increase the weight of the engine
 system by no more than 80%. The target specific fuel consumption (sfc)
reduction for the recuperated engine system will be 35% less than that
of the baseline engine system.    PHASE II: Phase II will fully develop,
 fabricate, and demonstrate the full recuperated turboprop\/turboshaft
engine system in a ground test environment.    PHASE III: Phase III
options should include endurance testing and integration of the enhanced
 propulsion system into the airframe and demonstrate the performance of
the system with flight testing in an Army manned or unmanned aerial
system mission environment.",

        "topic_name": "Analysis Tools for Composite Laminate Material
Properties Prediction",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Successful fielding of lightweight
composite material components requires dependable material property data
 early in the design cycle. Full sets of laminate data can be costly and
 time consuming to generate. The objective is thus to develop the
analysis techniques for reliable prediction of fiber reinforced polymer
matrix composite material properties based on ply level material
property data.    DESCRIPTION: Fiber reinforced polymer matrix composite
 materials continue to rapidly improve in terms of structural
performance. After a new material becomes commercially available,
however, there is often a significant lapse in time before that material
 can be successfully integrated into a structure. Large amounts of data
must be collected before there is adequate confidence in the material
properties to invest in designing hardware with that material system.
The laminate level material strength properties are heavily dependent on
 fiber orientation, and it is necessary to have thorough knowledge of
these laminate level material properties for design. These properties
are longitudinal and transverse tension and compression, longitudinal
and transverse open hole tension and open hole compression, shear,
bearing, and compression after impact. Currently available analytical
tools have been repeatedly demonstrated to fall short in terms of their
ability to reliably predict the aforementioned material properties based
 on ply level material property data. Having analysis techniques that
can reliably predict laminate level material properties based on reduced
 sets of ply level material property data could prove invaluable early
in the design cycle of fiber reinforced composite structures. This could
 greatly improve the rate at which advanced material systems mature and
thus bring benefit to missile and aviation systems in terms of weight
and insensitive munitions performance.    PHASE I: Develop and
demonstrate analytical approaches to predicting laminate level tensile
and compressive coupon material strength properties with a limited
amount of ply level material property data. Ply level data shall include
 unidirectional axial and transverse tension and compression material
property data.    PHASE II: Develop a modeling tool that allows the user
 to create a set of material property strength data for a pre-defined
laminate. This modeling tool should be able to predict a set of material
 strength property data that includes tension, compression, open hole
tension, and open hole compression all in both the axial and transverse
directions. This predicted data set shall also include shear and bearing
 properties. The statistical nature of each of these properties should
be able to be predicted using the modeling tool. Understanding the
statistical nature of the predictions is key to getting reliable
allowable material strengths early in the design cycle. The inputs to
the analysis tool should be limited to basic ply level material property
 data as well as matrix material properties. This phase should
successfully demonstrate the accuracy of the predictions across relavent
 environmental conditions including room temperature\/dry, cold
temperature\/dry, and elevated temperature\/wet.    International
Traffic in Army Regulation (ITAR) control is required.    PHASE III:
Weight reduction is of great importance in many aviation and missile
structures. The ability to reliably predict laminate material properties
 using ply level material property data and understanding the accuracy
of the predictions can drastically reduce the design cycle and allow the
 use of high performance material systems more quickly as they become
commercially available. This technology can be used across a number of
applications where weight reduction is important. This is considered
pervasive technology and can be applicable to future weight reduction
efforts for multiple Army systems including Javelin, JAGM, and TOW. It
has the potential to find uses in both military and commercial
applications. An example would be to create an analysis code that could
be integrated into a commercial finite element analysis code such as
Abaqus. This would allow users to quickly evaluate different laminates
in their designs prior to committing to a material system early in the
design cycle.",

        "topic_name": "Advanced Nonintrusive Dispense Tracking
Diagnostics for Aerospace Delivery Vehicles",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop accurate nonintrusive
techniques to track sub-missile dispense in very high speed flows.
DESCRIPTION: Missile carriage has been both proposed and used as a
practical means for the delivery and dispense of sub-missiles while
offering the advantage of quick response out to a considerable range.
Here the term sub-missile covers a broad spectrum to include munitions,
airframes, ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance)
platforms, supplies, flechettes, and even warhead fragments. Such
sub-missiles may themselves be powered, unpowered, guided, unguided,
intelligent, or passive devices. Regardless of the type, clean dispense
from the carrier missile remains a key problem area for the designer
with sub-missile-to-missile, and sub-missile-to-sub-missile interactions
 to be resolved. Often the dispense technique for a particular design
can only be validated through flight testing which is problematic enough
 and especially so at endoatmospheric conditions and flight Mach numbers
 from the supersonic into the hypersonic range.     Recently, the Army
has developed a shock tunnel based ground test facility that permits
free flight stage separation and sub-missile dispense. The facility is
unique in that it can produce the flow conditions required to duplicate
flight conditions of interest to missile developers (fully duplicated
flight conditions) with all the advantages provided by a ground test
facility for accurate test measurements. Principally because of the
extremely short facility run times (typically 10 to 100 milliseconds)
the types of instruments commonly used are limited primarily to
pressure, heat transfer rates, and accelerometer measurements.     What
is needed then for sub-missile dispense ground testing is an accurate
nonintrusive technique to track a finite number of dispense objects in
three-dimensions. The number of objects to track could be simply one for
 an ISR platform to as many as one hundred for flechettes. The existing
nonintrusive laser methodologies for flowfield velocity measurements,
LDV (laser doppler velocimetry) and PIV (particle image velocimetry),
might possibly be adapted for this particular application since
flowfield seeding is not an issue. Starring array CCD cameras and
tomographic techniques offer another possibility. Still, issues with the
 short run times and flowfield line-of-sight access must be addressed.
   PHASE I: This solicitation seeks innovative ways to make nonintrusive
 three-dimensional measurements (position and velocity) of sub-missiles
during free flight dispense in a ground test facility at flight Mach
numbers from 2 to 12 and altitudes from sea level to 80 km. Positional
accuracies to +\/- 2.5 mm over a spherical envelope of 2.5 m diameter
are desired. Technical approaches will be formulated for new and
innovative ways to make these measurements. These approaches shall be
distilled into a measurement concept(s). Phase I will then produce one
or more preliminary designs for innovative measurement devices.
PHASE II: The concepts formulated in Phase I will be developed and
refined in order to design and build an instrument. The instrument shall
 be demonstrated in an aero-propulsion facility defined by the
Government. A test program demonstrating the capability of the
instrument will be formulated and the instrument tested in this
facility. Test measurements shall be validated by comparison with known
experimental results or well characterized analytical results.     PHASE
 III: If successful, the end result of this Phase-I\/Phase-II research
effort will be a validated aero-propulsion measurement instrument. The
transition of this product will require additional tests to insure the
validity, accuracy, and range of the measurements. Furthermore,
practical limits to the number of dispense objects which can be tracked
will need to be developed.     For military applications, this
technology is directly applicable for validation testing of all systems
utilizing missile delivery and sub-missile dispense to include stage
separation and shroud separation, wherein multi-body interactions must
be characterized utilizing the tracking instrument and technology of
this SBIR.     For commercial applications this measurement technology
as an instrument has direct use for tracking particulates in a gas
stream, e.g. coal particulates in a cyclone furnace.     The most likely
 customer and source of Government funding for Phase-III will be those
service project offices responsible for the development of missile
delivered sub-missiles to include munitions, airframes, ISR
(Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) platforms, supplies,
and fragmenting warheads.",

        "topic_name": "Residual Property Prediction for Damage Composite
 Structures",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a novel modeling approach for
 predicting and quantifying the residual strength and stiffness of
composite material structures, specifically compression after impact
(CAI) strength.    DESCRIPTION: Advanced composite material systems are
vital to the development of lightweight, multi-functional Army missile
systems. In addition to reducing the weight of the structure, these
material systems provide the ability to expand the function of the
structure by tailoring stiffness and strength characteristics for
numerous applications. Carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy structures have
become very attractive for applications such as solid rocket motor
cases, missile airframes, missile guidance housings, as well as many
launch tubes and launcher primary structures. The Weapons Development
and Integration Directorate within AMRDEC has identified a need to
understand the operational fitness of these types of structures
following impact events from a wide range of energy levels.    It is
normally accepted that a limiting characteristic of thin composite
structures of this nature is the response of the impacted material to
compressive loads, such as buckling. It is also well documented that
delamination is the predominant damage mode in composite materials
subjected to impact damage. This delamination significantly affects the
residual compressive strength in the structure and there have been
numerous studies to characterize the compressive response of the
impacted structure using a variety of approaches. Post-impact
test-determined material properties, Hertzian law, force-energy
relationships, load-rate sensitivity approaches, absorbed-to-impact
energy ratio methods, hydro-code and semi-empirical methods are current
approaches used to estimate residual strength.    Novel advanced
composite material design and analysis approaches are sought to minimize
 the risk of damage by the combined effects of blast and fragmentation
from sources such as warhead detonation as well as single low-energy
impacts resulting from operations and maintenance impact accidents.
Little work has been performed on understanding these combined effects
on the residual strength of these structures. Additionally, a better
understanding of the low energy single or multi-point impact
characteristics on these materials\/structures is sought.    AMRDEC
seeks to advance the state of the art in post-impact determination of
residual strength, including compressive residual strength of composite
material structures used in defense applications.    A successful
response to this topic will deliver a computer subroutine that contains
novel mathematical\/physical approaches that can accurately assess the
residual compressive strength in impact-damaged composite material
structures. The code would be easily interfaced with existing finite
element or finite difference codes to perform design trade studies,
preliminary designs, and residual strength and fitness assessment of the
 structures. The computer model would provide a test-proven method that
can be used for design and inspection of composite material structures
subjected to single and multi-point impact scenarios with varying impact
 energy levels. The high-energy events typically result from high
velocity debris due to warhead detonation. The low energy events are
attributed to accidental tool impact, handling or dropping, and low
frequency, low amplitude vibration impacts due to ground transportation.
 Examples of critical structures are cylindrical solid rocket motor
cases and airframes, launcher primary structures, and launch tubes. The
goal of a three-phase SBIR process is the delivery of a novel
test-proven and verified method for use in determining the residual
compressive strength of composite structures for Army missile
applications.    PHASE I: Phase I will evaluate the technical merit and
feasibility of the proposed technology to determine residual compressive
 strength of advanced composite material structures. The awardee shall
present an initial concept method as a required Phase I deliverable;
supporting proof-of-principle data may be obtained by correlation with
existing data or selected strategic testing. This should include a work
flow for the subroutine, major parametric models to be included in the
subroutine, and strategies for integrating the model into commercially
available analysis codes. Projects seeking Phase II funding should
consider: 1) a sound strategy for validating the technology on different
 material systems and structural configurations; 2) simplicity of use
for design and analysis activities; and 3) development of new
understanding of critical parameters and their sensitivities on the
determination of residual compressive strength.    PHASE II: The initial
 approach verified in Phase I will be further developed and refined with
 the goal of maturing and expanding the computer model. The second phase
 will focus on expanding to validate the models using relevant material
systems, configurations, impact conditions, and environmental
conditions. Any processes\/methods developed in Phase I will be expanded
 to perform more robust correlations based on real world impact and
loading scenarios as defined by the appropriate AMRDEC Directorate. The
awardee should interface with potential military and commercial
customers to guide the scope of a potential Phase III effort.
International Traffic in Army Regulation (ITAR) control is required.
 PHASE III: Phase III will demonstrate a mature analytical computer
code\/technology. The goal will be a tool that can assess residual
strength in relevant composite material systems that are subjected to
impact damage scenarios in their operating environment. It will be
important also to understand the limitations of the model with respect
to the different conditions for which it will be used. The awardee will
deliver a product that can easily be integrated with existing computer
codes. This will enable transition of the technology to defense and
aerospace users. This is considered a pervasive technology but will have
 application for future Army weight reduction efforts for systems
including TOW, Javelin, and JAGM.",

Processing Techniques in Noisy Environments",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop and demonstrate
semi-active laser (SAL) signal processing algorithms designed to
optimize true target detection and tracking in noisy battlefield
environments.    DESCRIPTION: The military"s on-going need to maintain a
 precision strike capability for its SAL homing missiles and bombs
depends upon industry to develop innovative signal processing techniques
 for discerning true target laser signal returns in the noisy
electro-magnetic battlefield. As the employment of SAL-based seeker
weapon systems increases, SAL countermeasures are likely to be fielded
to degrade the war-fighter"s offensive capability. Conventional SAL
sensor designs utilize silicon-based detectors that measure laser
returns in amplitude and time. The seeker"s signal processing must be
able to discriminate the coded true target return from false laser
returns generated from natural or man-made sources, i.e. smokes, jammers
 and repeaters. These false laser returns include stretched pulses as
well as correlated and non-correlated pulses with variable repetition
rates. Legacy seeker designs were limited by the electronics available
at the time; thereby, producing signal processing methods tailored to
legacy electronics"processing capabilities and memory limitations. With
the vastly improved processing and memory capabilities in modern
electronics, alternative signal processing methods can implement in the
seeker to optimize detection of the true target and reject false targets
 and noise. These techniques may include adaptive filters and other
techniques that utilize characteristics (statistical, temporal, etc.) of
 the false target returns as discriminants. Since the engagement time
for SAL weapon systems is short, these techniques must be able to be
processed in real-time and within reasonable memory limitations for
embedded systems. This SBIR effort will focus on developing new SAL
signal processing algorithms that identify the true target"s coded laser
 pulses in dirty battlefield environments, prototyping the new
algorithms in a SAL seeker design using silicon-based detectors, and
demonstrating the algorithms in a laser seeker laboratory at the US
Army"s Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering
Center. These algorithms should be compatible with contemporary SAL
tracking methods. Data to be used to evaluate new algorithms will
include randomly generated pulses and laser decoy pulses. A goal of this
 research into SAL signal processing algorithms is to maintain the
viability of the existing SAL missile and bomb inventories as well as to
 assist future SAL seeker design efforts.    PHASE I: The proposal for
Phase I should identify innovative signal processing approaches that
optimizes true target pulse detection and tracking in noisy
environments, including natural and active SAL noise sources. Modeling
of the laser sources, seeker sensor, seeker electronics and signal
processing of a prototype seeker design will be performed to quantify
signal processing techniques in benign and dirty battlefield
environments.     PHASE II: In Phase II, the signal processing
algorithms will be programmed into a SAL seeker and demonstrated in an
AMRDEC laser laboratory to evaluate the performance of the algorithms in
 benign and simulated dirty battlefield environments. Classified
proposals are not accepted under the DoD SBIR Program. In the event that
 this effort will involve classified work in Phase II, companies invited
 to submit a proposal must have or be able to obtain the proper facility
 and personnel clearances in order to perform Phase II work. For more
information on facility and personnel clearance procedures and
requirements, please visit the Defense Security Service Web site at:
http:\/\/www.dss.mil\/index.html.  International Traffic in Arms
Regulation (ITAR) control is required.     PHASE III: Improvements to
SAL seeker signal processing can be incorporated into contemporary SAL
seeker designs for missiles, rockets and bombs as new countermeasure
technologies are fielded. Programs that would benefit from this
technological innovation would include, but are not limited to, the
following programs: HELLFIRE, Griffin, JAGM and small guided munitions
with SAL seekers. Commercial use of these signal processing algorithms
includes potential technology transfer applications for optical
communications in noisy environments.",

Signature Models and Simulations",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a technique or system to
rapidly develop earthen background terrain model representation of
actual world locations for use in electro-optical and infrared scene
rendering applications.    DESCRIPTION: This SBIR seeks innovative
approaches to decrease complexity and time associated with creating
terrain models for Multispectral Terrain Signature Models and
Simulations to a week or less. Current state of the art is to develop
physics-based imagery relying on accurate, high-fidelity scenes
characterized by their topography, terrain components (bushes, trees,
roads, etc.) and the EO\/IR characteristic of each. Scene sizes of 0.5
km X 0.5 km up to 10 km X 10 km are typically needed for such
applications. Historically extensive labor and brute force usage of
computer computational throughput has been leveraged to address terrain
model developments and objectives. These attempts have been met with
limited success and still require extensive amounts of labor and unique
processes to complete hence there is need for an innovative approach to
automating or semi-automating the processes. Computer computational
throughput enhancements have been tried without much success for
achieving our objectives. Examples of technical areas for consideration
are level of detail method, anti-aliasing for computation rendering,
clutter classification of real-world imagery, DTED extrapolation and
\/or surface model management. The goal for this task is to design,
develop and demonstrate an innovative technique or techniques for
rapidly developing real world background scenes compatible with and
suitable for use in Army scene rendering codes for UAS, and missile
simulations.    PHASE I: Design, develop and demonstrate a system
process for creating earthen background terrain databases used by
physic-based EO\/IR scene rendering tools for integration into missile
flight simulations. Metrics to quantify time improvements, end product
accuracy and fidelity will be chosen or developed by the contractor. An
actual world location will be selected to encompass many different
natural and man-made background elements: trees, bushes, roads,
buildings, etc. Attention to automate or semi-automate stage development
 of the current manual process is suggested to relieve bottleneck issues
 currently experienced.     PHASE II: Develop a prototype demonstration
system for rendering earthen background scenes compatible with existing
scene rendering system tools for missile flight simulations. The
software architecture and system operational requirements will be
clearly stated and compatible with existing Army tool suites.
Comparisons of the new scene development technology will be evaluated
against current development technologies for scene generations speed,
complexity, definition, accuracy. Scene development time reduction shall
 be determine and documented.    Example: Scenes shall be developed for
one real world location that encompasses many different natural and
man-made background components such as trees, bushes, roads, buildings
and so on at varying levels of fidelity. Metrics identified in Phase I
will be used again to assess speed, accuracy, and fidelity improvements
from background generation.    Classified proposals are not accepted
under the DoD SBIR Program. In the event that this effort will involve
classified work in Phase II, companies invited to submit a proposal must
 have or be able to obtain the proper facility and personnel clearances
in order to perform Phase II work. For more information on facility and
personnel clearance procedures and requirements, please visit the
Defense Security Service Web site at: http:\/\/www.dss.mil\/index.html.
International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) control is required.
PHASE III: Earthen background scenes of real world locations are used in
 many simulations from missile development to intelligence gathering.
Our goal is to generate EO\/IR scenes capabilities for a wide variety of
 environmental conditions and geographical domains. This technology is
targeted at scene rendering software integrated into flight simulations
such as: Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM), Small Organic Precision
Munition (SOPM) \/ Switchblade, Javelin, and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB).
Additional applications could be planning and rehearsal for soldiers,
UAS devices to determine the best approach routes, time of day for
mission execution, hazard identification or other limitations for
mission success.   Additional commercialization opportunities are: land
use monitoring for natural resources by NASA, disaster preparedness and
boarder monitoring for Department of Homeland Security. Adding rapidly
high fidelity scene generating capabilities to these organization"s
tools set for predictive models will improve their engagement modeling
to support a better use of resources.",

        "topic_name": "Flexible, Compact Acoustic Transducer Arrays",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Acoustic reconnaissance for Army
applications has had limited usage due to the large size of the
transducer arrays required for beamforming. The objective of the Phase I
 is to perform a feasibility study of a transducer technology that can
be integrated with flexible substrates for applications in compact
acoustic beamforming arrays.     DESCRIPTION: Acoustic reconnaissance
has a variety of unique capabilities including spoofing immunity,
ability to penetrate clutter, unique signature identification, jam
resistance, low cost, low weight, and minimal power consumption[1, 2].
Acoustic arrays not only provide directional information but also limit
background noise due to wind and other locally decorrelated noise. The
significant disadvantage of acoustic reconnaissance is the size of the
array. Direct size reduction of the individual transducers results in
decreased sensitivity, increased noise floor and correspondingly poor
sensor performance. Recent developments in acoustic transducers have
indicated several promising materials for reducing the size of acoustic
transducers[3] and most are compatible with current processing
technologies[4].  As a result, the potential for compact acoustic
transducers on flexible substrates is realistic in the near future.  In
conjunction with new transducer technology is the recent development of
acoustic metamaterials[5, 6].  Acoustic metamaterials have the potential
 to enhance the signal by controlling and directing the incoming
acoustic waves and aid in the size reduction of the overall array. The
main objective of this solicitation is to investigate material solutions
 to reduce the size of transducer arrays without a large reduction in
the sensitivity. The array itself should be flexible for the widest
possible range of applications, including unmanned aerial systems.
Incorporation of acoustic metamaterials is expected to aid in the
sensitivity of the array. Frequency range of interest is 20Hz to 20 kHz.
 This solicitation is aimed at the development of the transducer array.
The advancement of signal processing techniques is beyond the scope of
this task.     PHASE I: Conduct a feasibility analysis of a flexible,
compact, transducer array for acoustic beamforming. The transducers
should be compatible with current microfabrication techniques.     PHASE
 II: Design and fabricate a prototype transducer array on a flexible
substrate for acoustic sensing applications. Perform basic testing of
the transducer parameters including sensitivity and noise floor.
PHASE III: Develop a manufacturing plan for transition from prototypes
to initial production that is producible with a manufacturing process
such as a wafer scale process to reduce components costs.    Low cost,
compact acoustic transducer arrays that can be applied on a variety of
surfaces have numerous dual use applications including collision
avoidance for automobiles, imaging, and communications.      Collision
avoidance of unmanned aerial systems is currently achieved with the aid
of RADAR and optical sensors.  However, the availability of the RADAR in
 the battlefield may be limited.  Optical sensors often tend to yield
falls results in identifying incoming UAS.  Therefore, acoustic sensors
can be used to augment the existing detection technologies.  The
flexible acoustic sensors can be mounted on a curved surfaces of the
aircraft wing.      Unattended ground sensors currently used in the
battlefield are mounted on flat surfaces and they have to be deployed
manually. Sensors mounted on curved surfaces (e.g. spherical) can be
air-delivered.",

        "topic_name": "Sensitive and Diagnostic Mental Workload
Classifier",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this topic is to
develop an automated mental workload classifier sensitive to systems and
 tasks, as well as diagnostic of different types of mental workload
experienced.    DESCRIPTION:  The measurement of Soldier mental workload
 during test and evaluation (T&amp;E) is critical to understanding total
 system (comprised of the human and system) performance issues.
Currently the measurement of mental workload is a two step process.
First, a training session is conducted prior to the actual test event.
The training session is used to build a model of each subject.  During
the training session, subjects are instrumented to acquire physiological
 data while they perform specific cognitive tasks having pre-assigned
high and low states.  The physiological data is then processed and
psycho-physiological features of the subject"s mental state are
extracted and used to build a linear model.  Once the models are
developed and trained, the actual test event can begin.  During the test
 event, the model classifies new physiological data acquired from the
subject while they perform specific tasks associated with a system.
This approach provides a linear scale of the mental workload experienced
 by subjects.  However, the approach is limited by only being able to
determine when the mental workload was experienced and at what the level
 (high or low).  Assessing total system performance issues with the
current capability is challenging, if not impossible.      A more
comprehensive measure of mental workload is necessary for T&amp;E.  The
T&amp;E community desires a mental workload measurement that is
sensitive to the task or system and capable of diagnosing the type of
mental workload experienced.  A sensitive mental workload measure is
needed to discriminate between the workload imposed by one system or
task versus the workload imposed by another system or task.  A
diagnostic mental workload measure is required to discriminate between
different types of mental workload (visual, auditory, cognitive, fine
motor, gross motor, speech, and tactile) experienced during a task or
activity.  Such a capability will enable testers and developers to
optimize mental workload by identifying when a particular type of mental
 workload occurred and the system component or task associated with that
 mental workload.      The ideal mental workload classifier would
resemble the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Improved Performance
Research Integration Tool (IMPRINT) mental workload model.  The IMPRINT
model decomposes mental workload into 7 types: visual, auditory,
cognitive, fine motor, gross motor, speech, and tactile.  These 7 types
of mental workload are further decomposed into behaviors.  Each behavior
 is associated with a numeric value.  As the behaviors for each type of
workload become more complex, their numeric value increases.  This
establishes an ordinal and interval scale of mental workload.  The
IMPRINT model also takes into account the fact that several mental
workload types may be used simultaneously, thus creating conflict which
impacts the overall mental workload experienced.  Finally, the IMPRINT
model considers strategies to mitigate or compensate for high workload.
 By combining these features, the IMPRINT model can predict subject
mental workload over time, predict the type of mental workload
experienced, and identify the task or system component associated with
the mental workload.  This powerful tool enables the optimization of
mental workload for system design and analysis.      The intent of this
SBIR is to develop a physical capability to replicate what IMPRINT can
do in the modeling world.  The desired outcome from this topic is a
mental workload classifier for physiological data built around the
IMPRINT model of mental workload.  The classifier shall be capable of
discriminating between mental workload types and associated behaviors.
Additionally, the classifier shall be capable of accounting for
conflicts between different types of workload.  The desired product is a
 software application, and the associated source code, capable of
operating on a Windows XP platform or greater.    PHASE I: The Phase I
project shall determine the technical feasibility for developing a
mental workload classifier based on the IMPRINT workload model.  The
feasibility study shall focus on the development of a classifier capable
 of discriminating between various types of workload.  Phase I shall
also include the design of an IMPRINT based mental workload classifier
and the development of approaches for implementing the classifier.
Phase I deliverables will include results from the feasibility study,
the initial classifier design concept, initial development approach,
monthly progress reports and a final report.  The Phase I proposal shall
 emphasize the breadth of the commercial market for the proposed
classifier and explain in detail how the proposed classifier will fit
into the commercial market.    PHASE II: The Phase II project shall
develop a prototype automated mental workload classifier and the
associated methodology for implementing the classifier.  Efforts during
Phase II shall also include a validation study to ensure classifier
results.  The study shall compare classifier results against IMPRINT
predicted workload for a specified task.  Phase II deliverables include
the software application for the mental workload classifier, source code
 for the classifier application, a technical manual on how to use the
classifier, results of the classifier validation study, monthly progress
 reports, and a final report.    PHASE III: The vision for this research
 effort is to develop a fully automated mental workload classifier and
methodology for use in real time monitoring of subjects.  This effort
has the potential to transition to various military applications.  One
specific application is the Natick Soldier Center (NSC) Soldier Load
Management program.  The foundation for this program is to optimize the
Soldier"s physical and mental load.  The classifier developed from this
SBIR topic can play a vital role in the design of systems for the
Soldier Load Management program and it can be embedded as a part of the
fundamental technologies within the program to assess Soldier mental
workload.  Additional transition paths include the Test Resource
Management Center (TRMC) Tri-Service Warfighter Performance Test
Capability (TSWPTC) program.  TSWPTC is aimed at identifying and
developing critical Warfighter performance testing capabilities across
DOD agencies.  The program kicked off with a study which identified and
prioritized gaps associated with Warfighter performance test
capabilities.  The number two gap identified was physiological state,
which includes mental workload.     The Tactical Human Integration with
Networked Knowledge (THINK) and High Definition Cognition ATOs are
possible transition paths for this SBIR effort.  These ATOs will benefit
 from the advanced mental state classification algorithms developed
under this SBIR effort.  The classifications algorithms have the
potential to be applied to other psycho-physiological measurements for
more in-depth understanding of neuro-cognitive process and aid in
development of neuro-ergonomically designed Soldier-system interfaces.
  Commercial transition paths include the growing brain computer
interface (BCI) and ergonomics communities.  With respect to the BCI
community it is envisioned that the classifier developed from this
effort will be easily adaptable to other brain measures or functions.
This will allow BCI developers the opportunity to quickly tailor the
classifier to meet their system needs.  Additionally, the classifier has
 great potential for transitioning into the gaming market.  There are a
variety of systems currently being sold whereby users interact with a
video game or even a toy via their brain waves.  With the advanced
classifier developed from this SBIR, developers can greatly enhance the
types of mental interactions possible.    With respect to the ergonomics
 community there is a large interest in the assessment of operator
performance based on ergonomic design concepts.  Mental workload
measures related to operator performance are of great interest to the
ergonomics community, particularly in the automotive and aviation
fields.  Markets for the development and enhancement of air traffic
controller technologies are a prime use case for highly sensitive and
diagnostic mental workload classifiers.",

        "topic_name": "Free-Space Optical Communications: Light
Detection and Ranging Enhanced Data Delivery",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Using a single laser source,
demonstrate the capability to collect and transmit LiDAR (Light
Detection and Ranging) data via free-space optical communications in an
effort to expedite the delivery of tactical topographic information.
DESCRIPTION: LiDAR, or Light Detection and Ranging, is presently the
fastest developing mapping technique in the geospatial sciences and is
an invaluable asset to the Department of Defense (DoD).  However, unless
 the expedited transmission of data is addressed, the capture,
processing and delivery of LiDAR-generated tactical topographic products
 will not be possible in a manner advantageous to planners, field
commanders, and ultimately the soldier.    Over the past 10 years, as
laser scanning technology has developed, significant milestones have
been achieved in efficiency of the collection of range points for
mapping.  For example, the time to collect 1 million range points has
gone from 15 years using traditional survey methods, to 1.5 years using
analytical stereo photogrammetry, to 6.7 seconds using a LiDAR operating
 at a Pulse Repetition Frequency (prf) of 150 kHz.  Recently, with the
development of flash LiDAR technology, full-waveform recovery, and
Geiger-mode detection array-based systems, LiDAR is evolving from a
topographic mapping-only system into a truly active remote sensing
capability.  As a remote sensing system, however, the tactical and
terrain analysis benefits of LiDAR have yet to be fully realized,
especially as the technology moves away from analog detection and
processing (i.e., monopulse detection) to waveform digitization (i.e.,
full characterization of a target).    As LiDAR technologies become
increasingly capable of delivering tens or even hundreds of returns per
pulse, the utilization of this data will require novel delivery
strategies and algorithmic processing approaches to make this
information available to the Warfighter on an operationally-relevant
timeline. To address the data capture and delivery issue, this SBIR
solicitation seeks to explore the potential of enhancing LiDAR
capabilities by using free-space optics (FSO) to deliver data using the
same laser source that was used to acquire the data.     Presently,
LiDAR acquisitions require anywhere from 48 hours to 14 days for
meaningful product generation.  This is typically based on first
acquiring the data and either: 1) disk removal and transport to a
processing facility or 2) radio frequency (RF) transmission of data in
small packages to a processing facility.  The recent adaptation of a
free-space optics approach to data streaming is now moving data at a
potential 10 Gbps or more providing faster through-put for processing.
Furthermore, the advances in adaptive optics and real-time correction
algorithms will provide for data continuity and quality control.  While
this capability development is being explored for the transmission of
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, it has yet to be accomplished using
 the active source of a LiDAR system.  The development of a dual-purpose
 laser system for data capture and delivery is considered to be a high
risk \/ high reward technical obstacle.    PHASE I: Determine the
technical feasibility of using short-wave infrared lasers, inherent to
present-day LiDAR collection systems, as dual-use data transmission
devices.  Develop an innovative conceptual design which addresses laser
attributes (e.g., wavelength- such as 1550nm, pulse rate, propagation,
atmospheric effects such as scattering, absorption and scintillation),
as well as payload \/ power issues in the adaptation of collection
lasers to transmission lasers.  This research should also present
information on a realistic data streaming rate potentially achievable
with such a conceptual system.  Potential partners with regards to
existing LiDAR collection systems should be identified.      PHASE II:
Leveraging the results from Phase I, develop a prototype adaptable to a
current theater-operational gimbaled LiDAR (preferably airborne system).
  Provide practical implementation demonstrating the acquisition of
LiDAR data over a variety of topographies, and the subsequent
pre-processing and data telemetry via free-space optics (using the same
laser source) to transmit the data to a processing or collection
facility.  Address data continuity and quality control
capabilities\/limitations.    PHASE III: The expedited, FSO-based
delivery of LiDAR data (via a novel, dual-use laser
collection\/transmission capability) would benefit both the mapping and
tactical communities.  From a commercial perspective, such advancement
in geospatial data delivery would aid emergency response and disaster
relief efforts.  Technology transition would occur as integration into
an existing LiDAR mapping system, and military applications would
include expedited battlefield visualization and urban warfare
planning.",

 a research program to develop cell-based sensors for assessment of
toxicity in environmental water samples the US Army Engineer Research
and Development Center (ERDC) is seeking novel methods and materials for
 the long-term sustainment and storage of vertebrate cells. Unlike
current biorecognition based sensors that utilize antibodies, aptamers,
or other analyte-specific binding mechanisms, biosensors incorporating
intact living cells can respond to emerging, unknown, or combinatorial
chemical or biological threats and can act as broad spectrum screening
tools(1). Many of the available rapid cell-based toxicity tests for
water require significant control of environmental parameters, limiting
their use under non-ideal field conditions(2). Current cell-based
sensors are limited in utility and fieldability by the storage logistics
 and shelf life imposed by the use of vertebrate cell-based elements.
The use of bacteria on portable, rapid toxicity sensors enables several
long-term preservation methods such as freeze-drying or vacuum drying(3)
 that generally are not suitable for vertebrate cells. Importantly, the
results of these bacterial cell-based biosensors cannot be directly
extrapolated to vertebrate toxicity. Therefore, the use of vertebrate
cells in portable, rapid toxicity sensors becomes ideal due to the
direct translation of the toxicity information to a real time risk
assessment. Significant advances in the development of biosensors
utilizing mammalian cells have been made resulting in portable devices
that improve the cell survivability(4) or storage conditions(5). To
improve the fieldability and utility of cell-based sensing constructs we
 are seeking methods and\/or materials to allow long-term storage of
vertebrate cells under fieldable environmental conditions (see
performance metrics below) that require minimal operating and
preparatory steps prior to use.    PHASE I: Provide proof of concept
demonstration of methods and\/or materials for long-term storage of
vertebrate cells with minimal operating and preparatory steps and
environmental requirements. The concept will be original or will
represent significant advances or extensions of existing approaches.
Design and performance metrics for the proof of concept are given below.
 Note that due to the performance requirements cryogenic storage is not
an acceptable solution.  1) The method and\/or material must sustain
cells for a minimum of 3 months with greater than 80% viability.  2) The
 method and\/or material must require minimal temperature or
environmental control during storage. An ideal method\/material will
sustain cells under ambient conditions with storage temperatures up to
40 degrees C. Acceptable methods\/materials may require controlled
storage temperatures down to 4 degrees C. Methods\/materials requiring
lower storage temperatures are not acceptable. Preference will be given
to methods\/materials capable of cell storage under ambient conditions.
 3) The method must not require substantial user interaction to maintain
 cell viability. For example, solutions requiring frequent media or
reagent changes or additions are not acceptable.  4) The method and\/or
material must maintain the physiological functioning of the cells.  5)
Cells must be ready to use after storage in 3 hours or less with minimal
 preparatory or operational steps; shorter times are favored.  6) The
method and\/or material must be applicable to and effective for a broad
range of cell types, including fish, amphibian, avian, reptilian, and
mammalian. No method\/material must be developed that specifically
precludes the potential use of human cell lines.  7) The method and\/or
material must be transferrable to a glass or fused silica microfluidic
chip OR allow facile loading of reanimated cells onto a glass or fused
silica microfluidic chip with minimal operational steps.   Note that
many of the criteria above apply only to the conditions required for
storage\/maintenance and not to initial preparation of the cells for
storage\/maintenance.    PHASE II: Expand on the Phase I proof of
concept work to demonstrate extended cell viability and functioning for 6
 months with greater than 90% viability and be ready to use in 60
minutes or less with minimal operational steps under the performance
parameters described in Phase I. Demonstrate that the method is
applicable to a variety of cell types including fish, amphibian, avian,
reptilian, and mammalian. Additionally, the material and\/or method must
 either be contained on a glass or fused silica microfluidic chip OR
allow facile loading of reanimated cells onto a glass or fused silica
microfluidic chip with minimal operational steps. The total weight of
components necessary for cell sustainment, including protective case,
consumables, and any necessary hardware should be less than 2 lbs. Total
 volume, including protective case and any consumables should be less
than 1.0 ft(3)  note that this requirement applies only to cell
storage\/sustainment and not to initial cell preparation for storage.
Smaller and lighter solutions are favored. Demonstrate that the method
is viable under environmental conditions encountered in field testing.
Phase II deliverables include equipment and materials for independent
evaluation and testing.    PHASE III: Evaluate the ability of the
material\/method to preserve cells used in cell-based sensor constructs
during field testing. The material\/method will be used with the
SafePort water analysis system as well as other systems incorporating
cell-based sensors(6). Methods to preserve cells for cell-based sensing
have potential applications in a wide variety of areas including drug
toxicity screening in pharmaceutical studies, toxicity screening of
municipal and military water supplies, and studies of environmental
toxicity. A well-formulated marketing strategy will be critical for
success in these commercial applications.",

Organic Compounds in Water",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a field portable analysis
capable of detection and quantitation of chlorinated organic solvents in
 environmental water samples.    DESCRIPTION: As part of a research
program to develop field-portable sensors for water contaminants and
toxicants, the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC)
is seeking novel methods for rapid quantitation of chlorinated organic
solvents in environmental waters. Chlorinated organic solvents, such as
trichloroethylene (TCE), dichloromethane (methylene chloride),
tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene, PERC), and trichloroethane are
employed as industrial solvents in both military and civilian
applications and have proven to be persistent environmental
contaminants.  While the military has largely phased out use of these
compounds, detection of their presence in contaminated ground water is
an ongoing concern due to known toxic and carcinogenic effects
associated with exposure (1, 2). Current methods primarily involve the
use of gas chromatographic\/mass spectrometric (GC\/MS) methods (3, 4).
 While field-portable GC\/MS instrumentation is available, the
associated logistical burden is cumbersome and not ideal for rapid
sensing in the field.  We are seeking innovative research and
development to provide hardware and methodology for quantitation of
chlorinated organic compounds in environmental water samples with rapid
analysis times and minimal sample processing steps.     PHASE I: Provide
 proof of concept demonstration for quantitation of chlorinated organic
solvents in water. Design and performance metrics for the proof of
concept are given below. The concept will be original or will represent
significant advances or extensions of existing approaches. Note that due
 to the performance metrics, gas chromatography (GC) based solutions are
 not acceptable.  The proof of concept will demonstrate the technical
feasibility of all key elements required for successful execution of the
 proposed method.  1) The method should provide quantitation of
chlorinated solvents in environmental water samples with limits of
detection less than 5 ppb.  2) The method should require minimal
processing steps and require less than 30 minutes from water sample
collection to results.  3) The method must be transitionable to a glass
microfluidic chip-based design.   4) All hardware and consumables must
have a shelf life of at least 6 months with minimal temperature or
environmental controls.  5) The solution must be transitionable to a
handheld, battery-powered device.  Preference will be given to
technologies that provide quantitative analysis of individual compounds
in a mixture with the highest priority given to selective and
quantitative measurement of trichloroethylene (TCE).    PHASE II: Expand
 on the Phase I proof of concept work to construct and demonstrate
operation of a prototype chlorinated organic solvent quantitation
system. The system, including protective case, hardware, and consumables
 must be less than 2 pounds and must occupy a volume less than 1.0 ft3.
Demonstration will include determination of limits of detection,
sensitivity, selectivity for particular compounds, characterization of
interferant effects, and response time using simulated environmental
samples. Phase II activities should also demonstrate device feasibility
under field testing conditions. Phase II deliverables also include two
devices for independent evaluation and testing.    PHASE III: Evaluate
the ability of the device to quantify chlorinated organic compounds in
field studies.  Field tests will involve testing at Army and USACE
sites.  This device will be incorporated into the SafePort hand-held
water analysis system.  Military uses include detection and quantitation
 of chlorinated organic compounds on military lands and ranges and
monitoring of cleanup activities.  Civilian uses include monitoring of
municipal water supplies, environmental compliance studies, and
environmental monitoring of industrial process or waste streams. A
well-formulated marketing strategy will be critical for success in these

        "topic_name": "Environment and Conflict: Developing a Framework
for Vulnerability Assessment.",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop a framework that
understands and synthesizes the relationship between the natural
environment, local populations, and the corresponding impact upon
operations in areas of conflict.    DESCRIPTION: Environmental security
and human security are inextricably linked. However, less understood is
the impact that environmental security can play in creating conflict or
providing stability within a community. Secondly, the lack of a
synthesized framework to understand and assess impacts of this
relationship means that they are not fully incorporated into military
doctrine or planning paradigm. By seeking to fulfill this void, this
SBIR's objective is to systemically document the impact of environmental
 security upon local populations and the role that military operations
can play in sustaining and mitigating potential conflict.    As the US
Army is increasingly involved in military operations located in areas
where the natural environment is a contributing factor to the conflict,
it becomes important to understand what quantifies the environment and
qualifies how it contributes to the surrounding conflict. Therefore, the
 environment has significant potential in either positively or
negatively affecting military operations. For example, a degraded
natural environment can introduce stress into an area of operations and
in conjunction with other factors, either initiate conflict or
exacerbate existing conflict.  Additionally, US Army operations can
either directly or indirectly cause an environment to be degraded,
thereby introducing undesirable 2nd and 3rd order effects as a result.
To understand how military operations affect the natural environment and
 local populations, and conversely how the natural environment and local
 populations affect military operations will require a systemic
perspective that looks at the military operations, the natural
environment, and the local population all holistically together.
Given the changing security landscape, it is imperative to understand
the nuances that structure the relationship between environmental
security and human security. Although it is one that has been generally
understood, sometimes even anticipated and expected, the connection
between environment as a catalyst for conflict or cooperation is one
that has yet to be tangibly proven. To what degree can human security be
 linked to the environment? It is evident that there is an overwhelming
need for the military to assist positively relationship given the
potential for more successful military operations.    In attempting to
deal with these types of problems, the US Army has been increasingly
looking at how to view the complex operational environment from a
systemic perspective - especially when it comes to COIN
(counterinsurgency) operations. PAM 525-5-500 discusses the"wicked
problem"and the need to look at the battle-space from a systemic
perspective. Numerous articles in Military Review and Parameters have
cited the same need, especially in articles pertaining to the Army's new
 concepts on operational design. Operational design is reflected
formally in new US Army doctrine - specifically FM's 3-0 and 5-0.
However, while the general need for a systemic approach has been
described in these documents, the difficulty comes in how to actually
executing the approach into practice - especially when capturing and
modeling the social, environmental, and conflict systems. Given that the
 natural environment has the potential to: 1) contribute to conflict; 2)
 finance and sustain conflict; 3) undermine peace-making, it is
necessary to thoroughly understand how the environment operates in
initiating and transforming conflict. This SBIR will also consider how
environmental remediation has the potential to sustain effective local
governance.    PHASE I:  The contractor will need to create a notional
framework that captures and incorporates conceptually both the
significant entities and significant relationships of elements from all
three systems: the social, environmental, and conflict systems. During
this phase, a framework will be developed that will provide a
comprehensive capability for capturing and assessing the inter-related
roles that social, environmental, and conflict systems have on each
other in a dynamic setting across time and space. We know that it is not
 desirable or practical to build a complicated
social\/environmental\/conflict system from scratch. The goal is to
provide a framework with a practical number of significant entities and
relationships that would allow a tactical commander to understand and
explain his system and then effect change.  Ideally, we want a tool that
 will allow a commander to create and model his own environment so that
he can develop COAs and do"what if"scenarios.  Finally, the contractor
must demonstrate some basic capability to build a portion of the
proposed framework with software developed under this contract.    PHASE
 II: Using the framework derived from Phase I, the contractor will
complete system design. The contractor will develop the framework as
defined in Phase I as a prototype software system. The prototype system
will further develop and enhance the capabilities developed in Phase I.
The software must minimally allow the commander to visualize and
understand the indicators of the natural environment, the social factors
 and conflict. The SBIR will analyze the continuum between conflict and
cooperation and the role that the environment plays within it.    PHASE
III: Using methods derived from Phase I and Phase II, a deployable
vulnerability assessment will be the final outcome. The vulnerability
assessment tool will be able to diagram vulnerability based upon set
metrics and indicators. This should be demonstrated within a variety of
diverse case-studies. The system tool will incorporate both quantitative
 and qualitative methodologies and attempt to bridge the gap between
measuring direct and indirect correlations and causalities between the
environment, local populations and conflict. Potential users of this
technology beyond the Army include: State Department, USAID, NGOs, World
 Bank etc.",

        "topic_name": "System for Application of Biopolymer for
Revegetation of Soil",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop technology for application of
 biopolymer (non-petroleum-based compound) for rapid revegetation and
soil improvement on active training lands for improved usage and surface
 water quality, and reduced dust emissions.     DESCRIPTION: Military
training activities often result in environmental degradation due to
creation of heavily disturbed soil areas. These heavily disturbed areas
include, but are not limited to, dirt road beds, vehicular training
areas, tank trails, training areas for earth moving engineering systems,
 terrain subject to wildfires, artillery impact areas, helipads and dirt
 landing areas for aircraft. These areas are currently a challenge in
that they are resistant to revegetation efforts. These sites are also
susceptible to sediment loss through water erosion and the generation of
 dust through wind erosion. The traditional revegetation process
requires fertilization and application of a moisture retention agent,
currently a petroleum-derived polymer. Dust reduction on dirt roads
currently requires application of either water retentive and\/or a
petroleum product. Surface applied fertilization provides temporary
vegetative growth and often leads to nutrient transport to surface
waters, eutrophication of those waters and regulatory scrutiny. The
petrochemical products most often used as soil additives are known to
leach carcinogenic monomers and their use is often regulated by
environmental entities. The technical challenges that research and
development efforts should address are:   1. Specific soil mass loadings
 based on plant and soil type   2. Biopolymer application methods for
optimal performance   3. Delivery techniques including wet or dry
introduction of biopolymer to soil or seed coatings amended with the R.T
 biopolymer.   4. Selection of seed mixtures coordinated with biopolymer
 for specific climates and land use parameters.     This solicitation
will address EO 13514, which encourages the use of sustainable practices
 on all DoD installations and promotes conservation and protection of
the water resources of the nation through storm water management and
erosion control. In addition, this innovative research will support
recommendations set out in AR 200-3 (modified 2000) and PWTB 200-3-30
(2004),"Current Technologies for Erosion Control on Army Training
Lands."Innovative techniques for reduction of both water and wind-driven
 erosion of soil falls under several Federal laws and regulations
including the Clean Air Act (1990), Clean Water Act (1972, 1990), Soil
and Water Conservation Act (1977), and NEPA (1970). It is expected that
successful Small Business Innovative Research will contribute to
revisions of the Army"s BMP Technical Bulletin 200-3-30.     PHASE I:
Design an optimized system and techniques through the development of
soil mass loading rates for biopolymer based on climate, soil type and
native plant species commonly used for re-vegetation activities of
eroded or otherwise degraded soils. These application rates should be
high enough to reduce sediment transport in runoff water and fugitive
dust emissions across a range of climate and use conditions but low
enough to keep the biopolymer commercially competitive with
petroleum-based soil stabilization products.  Develop preliminary
(proof-of-concept) data for innovative methods of biopolymer\/seed
delivery based on climate, soil type and land use that may include, but
are not limited to, hydroseeding, seed coatings for aerial delivery, as
well as wet and dry application methods.  The success criteria for the
concept of biopolymer for erosion control and re-vegetation of degraded
lands are:    Decreased sediment transport in runoff water    Decrease
in fugitive dust emissions   Rapid establishment of planted species
compared to controls as measured by above ground biomass and soil
coverage   Increased rate of germination for seeds in the
biopolymer-treated soil versus seeds in an untreated control soil
Increased drought tolerance for seeds in the biopolymer-treated soil
versus seeds in an untreated control soil    Increased root mass for
plants in the biopolymer-treated soil versus plants in an untreated
control soil     PHASE II: Based on the results of the preliminary
testing and the application design schemes (Phase I), perform a
pilot-scale test for application and evaluation of biopolymer for rapid
re-vegetation of heavily disturbed soils in areas where soil
disturbances are contributing to loss of topsoil, excessive fugitive
dust emissions, and\/or reduced habitat or soil viability. The success
criteria for the pilot-scale evaluation are:    75% reduction of total
suspended solids in runoff water from the biopolymer-treated area versus
 an untreated control area    50% reduction of fugitive dust emissions
from the biopolymer-treated area versus an untreated control area    50%
 increase in viable habitat for indigenous species versus a control area
    Increase in soil quality indicators such as soil nitrogen content as
 a result of the growth of multiple crops of nitrogen fixating legumes,
organic carbon, soilorganic matter.     A technical report will be
provided that documents the optimized system and techniques for the
application of a biopolymer formulation for the revegetation of
disturbed soil areas, preliminary data for application of the biopolymer
 using candidate climate specific plant species commonly used for
revegetation, design schemes for field application, and results of
preliminary laboratory tests that address the Phase I and Phase II
success criteria.     PHASE III: Develop a commercial system for
application of the biopolymer to areas of heavily disturbed soil that
can be used throughout the Army and DoD. Based on the results of Phases I
 and II, perform one or more field demonstrations on an active or closed
 U.S. Army facility using the commercial system for biopolymer
application. Other commercial applications could be found in the
construction or agriculture industries.    Completion of multiple soil
amendment procedures in varied climates and soil types representing a
range of Army facilities.    Publication of guidance documents detailing
 specific approaches for the use of biopolymer soil additives for

        "topic_name": "Downscaling Techniques for Ground State
Information",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Define and develop scaling algorithms
 to support rapid computation and identification of Army scale soil
strength    DESCRIPTION: The computation of high resolution near surface
 profiles of soil moisture is critical to determining soil strength for
Army scale mobility predictions, DoD target acquisition and
identification, and flood mapping.   There is a significant technology
gap between the ability to compute high resolution soil moisture maps in
 austere environments due resolution limits in remote sensing and
weather modeling technologies (weather scale).  New methods are needed
to bridge the gap between the limits of available coupled weather and
land surface modeling science with target and mobility scale resolutions
 required by Army.  This topic addresses a specific goal of developing
mathematical modeling method designed to bridge the gap between weather
scale and Army scale.     PHASE I: This proposed SBIR seeks to define
downscaling and up scaling algorithms and related available software and
 hardware to support rapid identification of areas of low surface soil
strength and related soil moisture.  The study is expected to support
mobility predictions, buried explosive detection, improved flood models,
 and other related terrestrial engineering studies.  The downscaling
algorithms will support current data sources for soil moisture at the
global scale as generated at resolutions of 25 kilometers or less as
distributed by the Land Information System (LIS) generated by the Air
Force Weather Agency (AFWA).  Currently the LIS fails to define the
localized extremes in soil moisture variability occurring due to
elevation changes, vegetation, soil type, or other related factors.
Local weather stations provide only point data requiring upscaling of
information to define soil moisture outside the local area.  The
investigator will address innovative techniques to support in
downscaling and up scaling soil moisture data.      The required
deliverables in Phase I will include bi weekly progress reports, a
prototype algorithm supporting input of low resolution soil moisture
along with correlated attributes (as defined in this study) with outputs
 of high-resolution moisture data, and supporting ground truth documents
 of the down scaling and up scaling programs.  The small business will
produce a conceptual design and breadboard supporting the development
and demonstration of a prototype program to downscale moisture data
derived from existing LIS AFWA supplied data sets, elevation data, soils
 data, and any other data sources determined as highly correlated to
changes in soil moisture.  Obtaining soil moisture grids at 1 to 25
kilometer resolution, the small business will define soil moisture
variations at scales of the existing elevation grids of 100 meters or
less.  The resulting algorithms should be sufficiently portable enough
to allow integration into a Geographic Information System (GIS) or Open
Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant mapping system.    Simple
interpolation algorithms are limited due to the complex nature of
multiple hydrologic processes affecting the soil moisture.  Conversion
of this soil moisture to standard units such as rating cone index, to
support maneuver predictions would be part of the research effort.  The
research will provide algorithms which produce high resolution soil
strength and\/or soil moisture maps at minimum resolutions of 100
meters.  The product would identify calibration sources and define the
expected error in the predictions for risk assessment.  This phase will
demonstrate the feasibility of producing a demonstration of downscaling
of soil moisture data within the US and Afghanistan, and will outline
the demonstration success criteria by the generation of a first
generation downscaling\/up scaling tool box.  The study will include
reviews of innovative methods to validate the new high resolution maps
of soil moisture.    PHASE II: The contractor will develop, demonstrate,
 and validate the down scaling and up scaling algorithms created in
phase I with sites in the US and at least one site overseas.  Required
phase II deliverables will include source code and program which takes
as input low resolution global soil moisture data and related
information from AirForce Weather Agency and process this data using
correlated terrain data such as elevation to resolutions of 100 meters
or less.  The soil moisture data should be exhibited in terms of
volumetric and gravimetric data using the most current soils information
 for the region.  The data for the top 10 centimeters should show good
correlations with ground truth collected in the regions.  The
deliverables will include sample data supporting the downscaling
technique for a region no less than 40 kilometers by 40 kilometers in
the US and a least one site overseas.  The program is expected to be a
toolbox within ArcGIS which takes as input the data source required to
generate the high resolution data grid.       The contractor will also
develop, demonstrate, and validate a up scaling algorithm as a component
 of a GIS or OGC-compliant web mapping service which takes as input a
one or more weather stations and generates the a grid of soil moisture
at the resolution of 100 meters or less within a region of 40 km by 40
km.      The contractor shall demonstrate the accuracy of both the
downscaling and upscaling techniques using a jackknife statistical
approach.  The correlation between the predictions will be supplied as
an additional attribute in the shape file created from the ArcGIS
toolbox.       During Phase II the contractor will have biweekly
telecoms with the government POC and provide a report each quarter
detailing progress.  Updated versions of the program will be provided to
 the government at the end of the study along with source code and
documentation.       PHASE III: Numerous industries within the U.S. see
impacts from high soil moisture or weakened soils, including logging,
construction, and agriculture.  The ability to compute high resolution
soil strength would benefit each commercial sector.  Inversely, the
ability to compute high resolution soil moisture states for agriculture,
 better identifying areas of excessively moist or dry soils at small
field-scale resolutions, could lead to better improved irrigation and
fertilization efficiencies.",

        "topic_name": "Improved Solar Shade (ISS) with Enhanced
Durability and Performance",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To research and develop a modular,
ruggedized, Improved Solar Shade (ISS) material and deployment system.
  DESCRIPTION: Solar shading has been demonstrated to be the most cost
effective approach to reduce fuel consumption for climate control in
expeditionary shelters. These relatively simple, low cost shades have a
very high Return on Investment (ROI).  Current solar shade systems lack
in durability as they have typically only lasted through about one (1)
year of use. [10] This design life is severely less than the shelters,
supplies, and equipment that the shade would protect and cover.  The
strike and erect process of solar shades after they have been used for
an extended period of time often result in fabric tearing in the
degraded material.    Data collection through Net Zero+ Joint Concept
Technology Demonstration identified solar shading as one of the most
significant energy saving solutions for expeditionary shelters in warm
climates, offering a dramatic ROI. [12] Providing greater than 70% solar
 block capability and an air gap (convective cooling) between the shade
and the covered object greatly lowers the effects of solar heating.
With shading:     Shelters demand significantly less energy to maintain a
 constant cool temperature    Environmental Control Units (ECU) function
 more efficiently    Fuel and water bladder material lifespan can
increase.   Supplies and other equipment remain cool and pose less of a
hazard.    A new solar shade system is desired that is designed to shade
 objects with various forms to reduce visual signature and lessen volume
 of the packaged system.  This is best facilitated by employing modules
or kits, for example, using a large initial"starter kit"to cover a 32
foot long TEMPER-Air Supported shelter with available add-ons for
shading vestibules, ECUs, or annexing kits.  Starter kits could also
vary in size based on the shelter, equipment, or supplies being covered.

(383)................................FED-STD 595    PHASE I: Develop a
new, more ruggedized solar shade material that can withstand a higher
degree of environmental effects (primarily UV, high wind loads) and
achieve a longer useable lifespan than the first generation. The total
life span for the new solar shade will be four (4) years.  The objective
 is to accomplish this increased durability while maintaining or
improving upon the shading ability and its energy saving effects.
Measuring the improved shading will consist of opacity thru the shade; a
 standard test shown in the chart above. [2] The improved durability
will include a longer life span, less tearing in the fabric and less
degradation in the material. Measuring the durability of the solar shade
 will consist of strength testing, the weathering of the material, and
air permeability tests; these tests are all referenced in the above
chart. [2] The fabric weight must be less than 10 oz\/yd, as shown in
the chart. [2] The package volume should be no greater than the current
solar shade system (NSN 5410-01-519-7185); the system as a whole should
be optimized for both weight and packing volume.  For reference
purposes, a 50 foot by 50 foot solar shade system weighs 220 pounds and
should be optimized for packing volume. Deliverables for Phase I would
include samples of all of the improved fabric\/material considered for
shading, environmental, and durability testing.  Only one
fabric\/material solution is required, but multiple are acceptable for
Phase I.  Sample sizes for each of the prototype materials should be no
less than fifteen (15) continuous yards for testing and evaluation of
the prototype material.  In addition to an improved material, an
improved system for assembly and system deployment is also desired.  The
 second Phase I deliverable will be to provide multiple concepts and\/or
 models for an ISS deployment system.     PHASE II: Phase II should
consist of optimizing the shade material developed in Phase I for
manufacturing large quantities and continuing to develop the ISS
deployment system.  The objectives will include developing"starter
kit"systems that are form fitting to the shelter to reduce system volume
 and weight.   The second objective will be to continue to develop
multiple"add-on kit"designs.  By the end of Phase II, the ISS material
and system should comply with all the characteristics\/metrics described
 in this solicitation.  The deliverables will be five (5) full ISS
system"starter kits"for 32 foot long TEMPER-Air Supported shelters, two
(2) vestibule"modules,"and one (1) annexing"module"for testing  and
evaluation purposes.  The ability of the starter kit to integrate with
each module type will also be evaluated. These kits will include the new
 ISS fabric\/material and all hardware required for deployment.  The
cost goal for the ISS system should be roughly the same as the current
systems, ~$1\/square foot, or less.     PHASE III: Phase III should
include a manufacturing plan for full scale production and supply for
this technology as part of a commercialization strategy.   As discussed
in this solicitation, shading is the most efficient way to reduce the
energy demand caused by solar heat load.  The return on investment (ROI)
 on solar shades is very high in comparison to other technical
solutions.  A more durable ISS could benefit all the US armed forces
branches that deploy temporary structures in addition to benefiting any
commercial or industrial temporary structures under high solar heat
load. This technology could be used to reduce energy costs in both
Contingency and established bases as solar covers over shelters and can
also reduce heat load in open environment areas for stored equipment and
 maintenance facilities.  The solar shading fabric technology has
commercial and residential applications that include skylight covers,
patio covers, awning applications, event shading, and shading systems
for parking lots.",

        "topic_name": "Anthropometric Casualty Estimation
Methodologies",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Define, develop and demonstrate
anthropometric casualty estimation methodologies for analyzing personal
protective equipment fit and form taking into account individual body
shape differences impact on Soldier protection    DESCRIPTION: Soldier
force protection is a major Army challenge to ensure the highest degree
of Soldier survivability across the spectrum of Army operations. Soldier
 body armor is designed to provide individual ballistic and blast
protection to improve the Soldier survivability when facing small arms
fire, artillery, and secondary fragmentation from explosions (e.g.
improvised explosive devices, IEDs). Body armor, and other wearable
protective equipment, fit individual body shapes differently and the
variation in coverage leads to variation in Soldier protection and
survivability. For example, the Army"s Interceptor body armor uses four
rigid plates that can stop most lethal bullets; however the wide ranges
of body types results in variations in fit that can impact protection.
The Army has a need for improved tools to assess the effectiveness of
material solutions to provide Soldier protection while taking into
account the variation in individual protective equipment fit.      Key
metrics are to take into account most individual body shape variations
in the design of Soldier protective equipment as well as to identify
critical fit and form issues and their associated impacts.  The Army has
 invested heavily in an anthropometric survey and the collection of
accurate three dimensional (3D) data of active duty Soldiers to enable
development of better anthropometric models to assist in Soldier
clothing and equipment design. New and innovative anthropometric-based
casualty estimation methodologies are needed that can leverage and
utilize these 3D data sets to design improved protective systems that
better fit the range of body types to optimize Soldier protection while
maintaining combat effectiveness.    PHASE I: Research and develop an
innovative approach to advance the design of anthropometric casualty
estimation methodologies capable of addressing individual body shape
differences for the design of Soldier protective equipment.  The
approach must start with a needs assessment to identify potential design
 alternatives and assess their capability to support, develop, extend
and integrate into existing capabilities.  Assumptions, limitations,
barriers and bounds of design alternatives shall also be assessed and
presented.  Proposed methodologies will enable the quantifying of the
impact of body size\/shape variation on the fit and form of Soldier
protective equipment on Soldier survivability. The design must also
provide a clear explanation of how the proposed concept can be extended
in more detail and how any potential concept shortfalls can be achieved
in a SBIR Phase II effort (this task will not be accepted as a Phase I
option task).  A proof-of- concept of the soundness, feasibility and
validity of the proposed advanced design approach concept will be
performed.  The concept must clearly demonstrate a linkage between high
level and low level elements and express the critical need for their
inclusion.   The Phase I process and results will be captured in a final
 report identifying the recommended design approach, process,
assessment, details and rationale for recommendation.         PHASE II:
Define and refine a functional prototype of anthropometric casualty
estimation methodologies designed in Phase I. Demonstrate how the
prototype system supports a practical implementation for conducting
anthropometric based casualty assessment on standard anthropometric data
 sets to represent individual body shape variation for Soldier
protection and PPE design. Conduct verification and validation (V&amp;V)
 studies to establish that the model properly represents the body fit
variation data (i.e. scan, survey data, etc) to support casualty
assessment. Document the design, development, resulting Phase II
products, process and demonstrations of the proposed concept to include a
 listing and explanation of assumptions, traceability, barriers and
bounds associated with the modeling approach.       PHASE III: The
initial use for this technology will be to allow design of improved
protective systems that fit the range of body types to optimize Soldier
protection.  The SBIR results could also support various commercial
applications.  Examples of potential  applications range from local and
state government first responders and disaster preparedness
organizations, logistics planning and forecasting, police planning and
mission rehearsal, and the software gaming industry.        The SBIR
results could support various commercial applications by extending the
concept and prototype developed in Phase I and II for commercial and
military use, such as demonstrating the use of the tool in early Soldier
 protective equipment design or selection processes. Multiple commercial
 applications exist for this SBIR technology to include commercial
protective equipment design and manufacturing, and even use in sports
applications, such as protective equipment against sports injuries in
football, car racing, hockey, and extreme sports.",

        "topic_name": "Non-invasive Detection System for Assessment of
Oxidative Status",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop a portable detection
system to assess oxidative status of the Warfighter using non-invasive
techniques and to determine the effects of micro nutrient interventions.
    DESCRIPTION: Strenuous physical exertion induced Reactive
Oxygen\/Nitrogen Species (RONS) production in the muscle has been
correlated with degradation of muscle force output, fatigue and muscle
soreness in animal and human models(1).  RONS are generated during
normal metabolic function and have important roles in cell signaling.
However, when production of RONS in the body exceeds the body"s innate
ability to neutralize them, oxidative stress occurs, compromising
physiological function due to cellular damage(2,3).  RONS can induce
cellular damage by oxidizing lipids, proteins, and DNA(4).  Oxidative
stress, defined as oxidative damage to cells and tissues caused by
unregulated RONS production, contributes to degradation of physical
performance and can occur due to environmental and physiological
stressors, traumatic injury and physical exhaustion(5).  Moreover,
oxidative stress is known to play a role in muscle atrophy(6) which is
commonly experienced during Warfighter recovery from injury.  Oxidative
stress stimulates the endogenous antioxidant defense systems, and when
intrinsic mechanisms are depleted, oxidative stress may be mitigated by
exogenous antioxidants found in foods to maintain cellular
homeostasis(7,8,9).  Recent studies show that low-level RONS production
that occur during exercise\/training contribute to beneficial muscle
adaptations by inducing up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes(2).
Excessive consumption of dietary\/supplemental antioxidants has been
shown in animal and human models to negatively impact muscle adaptation
to exercise and aerobic performance, by blunting RONS production and
up-regulation of antioxidant defenses(10).  Hence, it is important to
maintain beneficial levels of RONS, so as not to compromise Warfighter
adaptation to initial military training (IMT), and reduce combat
effectiveness.      A non-invasive detection system is required to
assess\/discern the changes between baseline oxidative status and
oxidative states involved in muscle adaptation or cellular damage in the
 context of the effects of dietary interventions and physical
performance in healthy and recovering Warfighters.  Detection system
performance goals include adequate sensitivity, precision and accuracy
to determine the influence of dietary intervention on oxidative status
biomarkers. A systemic measurement is critical for accurate assessment
of overall status.  Various biomarkers exist for measuring oxidative
status, however, the degree to which they are altered may depend on the
physical challenge.  Therefore the detection system should also
demonstrate effectiveness over a range of physical challenges (e.g.,
IMT, field training) faced by the Warfighter.  Successful quantification
 of changes in oxidative status that stimulate muscle adaptation and
cause cellular damage would enable researchers to recommend nutritional
strategies.       A non-invasive assessment tool will significantly
reduce the overall cost and time needed to sample invasive fluids (e.g.,
 blood), which is generally difficult and not suitable during field
research.  Proof of beneficial effects of bioactive nutrients on
oxidative stress and Warfighter performance has been elusive largely due
 to technological limitations in measuring blood biomarkers(11, 12).  As
 a result, the evidence is minimal regarding the mechanisms by which
environmental stressors and common physical challenges faced by the
Warfighter promote oxidative stress and degrade performance.  The
proposed research tool would facilitate the establishment of accurate
baseline oxidative status measurements, to examine effects of dietary
interventions and how it relates to Warfighter performance(10).  This
system will benefit future research designed to understand the
relationship between oxidative status, nutrition and Warfighter
performance.    PHASE I: Initiate design concepts for a non-invasive
detection system with a small footprint",

(MIDSS) for Rotorcraft",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this SBIR is to
develop a Multi-functional Integrated Drive System Sensor (MIDSS)
capable of measuring multiple parameters critical to the operation and
health of a rotorcraft drive train.      DESCRIPTION: This effort will
develop a MIDSS capable of measuring strain, vibration, torque and
temperature at multiple locations. The ability to provide complete
measurement capability for an entire gearbox or set of shafts is
desired. The MIDSS measurements should be of sufficient accuracy and
sampling rates for monitoring of normal drive-train function, detecting
and quantifying over-speed or over-torque conditions, and use in
calculation of advanced drive train health indicators. The MIDSS needs
to be capable of interface to cockpit displays as well as being fed to
on-board monitoring systems. The effort should address the sensor
requirements such as accuracy and resolution, networking or multiplexing
 capacity, reliability and fault tolerance. Oil debris or quality
sensors would be difficult to incorporate within the system and are not
required as part of the effort.    Other desired attributes to consider
for Phase III are (1) impact per Mil-Std 810F, Method 516.5; (2)
vibration requirements of Mil-Std 810F, Method 514.5; (3) acceleration
per Mil-Std 810F, Method 513.5; (4) altitude per Mil-Std 810F, Method

Method 504; and (11) electromagnetic interference (EMI) per Mil-Std 461E
 as modified by ADS-37A-PRF Table 1.    PHASE I: Phase I of the effort
will prove the feasibility of the proposed technology approach. Phase I
will develop the technology sufficiently to prove the ability to
integrate the required measurement capabilities and implement a MIDSS.
The effort should address the monitoring requirements for a
representative drive system component. The technical viability of the
various sensors, as well as any associated digitization and multiplexing
 should be demonstrated at a bench test level. The source of data needed
 for the selected drive system component as well as any performance,
usage or diagnostics models should be addressed.  An aircraft level
architecture and a roadmap for implementation should be defined under
this phase.  The architecture must address integration with existing
aircraft Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS).    PHASE II: Phase
II will develop the Phase I technology into a fully functional
prototype. The MIDSS will be tested to assess the accuracy of the
measurement capabilities as well as an aircraft level architecture.
Individual sensor testing will be conducted along with the ability to
combine multiple sensor locations covering the entire aircraft drive
system.     PHASE III: The technology is applicable to both military and
 commercial rotary wing aircraft (qualified to military standards listed
 in description) to monitor components and performance in real time.
This technology will be used on high value and flight safety critical
drive system components.  The MIDSS will alert the user to component(s)
stressed beyond their intended boundaries.  The reduction of the wire
weight and number of sensors will prove to be very beneficial.  As this
technology matures it can be transitioned to non-aircraft applications
such as gearboxes used in the wind energy industry.",

        "topic_name": "Air-to-Air Targeting Algorithms for Turreted Gun
Systems",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop air-to-air targeting
algorithms for a turreted gun systems such as found on AH-64D helicopter
 (Reference 1) that could use impact, proximity and airburst fused
rounds. The application of this technology applies to helicopters,
ground vehicles and ships. This system will increase accuracy against
air targets and ground targets, thereby reducing collateral damage and
increasing survivability.     DESCRIPTION: This effort will focus on the
 development of air-to-air targeting algorithms for a turreted gun
systems such as found on the AH-64D helicopter (Reference 1) that could
use impact, proximity and airburst fused rounds. The application of this
 technology applies to other helicopters, ground vehicles and ships.
(References 2,3,4) Critical technical measures to be demonstrated
include system accuracy against air targets that is equivalent to
current ground targets engagements.    Continuing development of
airborne threats has increased risk for military rotorcraft. Development
 of air to air targeting algorithms for a stabilized turreted gun
systems has not kept pace with technology and improvements are needed to
 be effective against aerial systems. Military helicopters use machine
guns as offensive and defensive weapons against air and ground targets.
Some guns are mounted on remotely operated turrets aimed by the pilot
using head \/ eye trackers (AH-64, AH-1, soon MV- 22), some are mounted
on swiveling pintles and are aimed manually by crew members (door \/
window guns on UH-60, MV-22, UH-1, CH-53). All have challenges in
targeting airborne targets where the target is moving rapidly in three
directions. Aircraft state, recoil, round ballistics, winds, target
state estimators, tracking system, targeting sensor accuracy, GPS
location, laser ranging, pointing accuracies, turret errors, target
speed and target maneuverability all contribute to error in targeting
solution. New air to air targeting algorithm approaches need to account
for all these errors to increase the accuracy against airborne targets.
    Turreted guns provide great operational flexibility by allowing
off-axis shots in virtually any direction, but they have limitations on
accuracy for maneuvering airborne targets. The standard of performance
for aerial gunnery from an AH-64D is to achieve at least one hit out of
30 shots fired at a wheeled vehicle between 800  1200m distant
(Reference 5).     Given the performance demonstrated in references 6
and 7, it is reasonable to think that improvements in air-to-air
accuracy could be equivalent to current air-to-ground targets
engagements. Given the vast reduction in potential for collateral
damage, the system will pay for itself after 2 or 3 instances of the
pilot using the gun rather than an expensive air-to-air missile.
PHASE I: The Contractor will determine the feasibility of developing
air-to-air targeting algorithms for a turreted gun systems such as found
 on AH-64D helicopter (Reference 1) that could use impact, proximity and
 airburst fused rounds. The Phase I effort will take into account time
based information and associated errors related to aircraft state,
aircraft location error, sensor error, target location error, laser
range error, winds to target, ballistic table for round, round
fragmentation shape, intelligence of target type, target tracking error,
 gun pointing error, gun dynamics, GPS and INS error on aircraft, GPS
and INS error on gun, millimeter wave radar data and error, sensor and
gun motor delays, recoil, target state estimators, tracking system,
targeting sensor accuracy, GPS location, pointing accuracies, turret
errors, target speed and target maneuverability (Ground and Air). The
Phase I effort approach to software development will be in a modular
approach (Plug and Play) for parameters identified above and allow for
variance in time based information and associated errors. The software
approach and architecture should be compatible with the Joint Multi-Role
 (JMR) system (Reference 8 and 9). Successful algorithm designs shall
achieve air-to-air accuracy equivalent to current air-to-ground targets
engagements with graceful degradation if the above parameters change or
become inaccurate.    PHASE II: The contractor shall demonstrate the
performance in a high fidelity simulation (preferably
hardware-in-the-loop) and ground-based tests of firing accuracy from a
moving ground platform (vehicle or motion-base) shall be done at a
minimum. At the end of Phase II the live fire performance of the system
shall be demonstrated to the Government. Technology Readiness Level, TRL
 6 - System\/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant
environment     PHASE III: This technology addresses two of the DoD"s
fundamental operational requirements; to perform airborne missions
against airborne threats, and to minimize collateral damage. It will
benefit helicopters, ground vehicles and ships. The technology can be
used by both civilian and military sectors to improve tracking of
objects with multiple inputs and increase the accuracy to the tracking.
Police, Coast Guard and Border Patrol could use the technology to track
persons or objects of interest.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project is to
design, develop, and demonstrate an advanced small, lightweight man
portable multi-fueled 3,000 W power unit.  A key tenet of this power
unit is that it should take advantage of recent advances in small
lightweight high speed internal combustion engines which include but are
 not limited to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) engines.
DESCRIPTION: The implementation of this technology could address several
 operational capability gaps across the broad spectrum of small power
sources.  The current Tactical Quiet Generator at 326 pounds and
approximately 20% efficiency is outmoded and represents old technology;
and currently there are no fielded systems in the range of 3 kW which
weigh less than 200 lbs, and can operate on JP-8 over the range of
military environments.  In addition, the increasing advance of digital
equipment and soldier battery loads is increasing the demand for a
lightweight power source for forward area\/platoon level battery
charging. Small hybrid\/alternative energy systems are also seeing
increased use with generators in the 3 kW range for assured power. Use
of smaller generators would be more efficient than using larger sets at
part-load conditions.  Increased efficiency of the generator is needed
at both full and part-load conditions.  Multi-fuel operation is desired
in order to take advantage of locally available fuels (diesel, JP-8,
gasoline).  In addition it is desired that the technology can meet all
the requirements for forward deployed equipment and provide quality
power over a wide range of environmental extremes.     PHASE I: Phase I
will be a technical analysis and feasibility study to determine an
analytical and engineering design approach to develop the 3 kW
Lightweight Efficient Generator. The offeror will identify any
challenges\/technical barriers as well as the technical benefits to the
engineering design approach for the 3 kW Lightweight Efficient
Generator. This study will provide a detailed technical description of
the engineering\/design approach, expected technical value, and any
assumptions.  It should also include a plan for measuring, evaluating
and demonstrating the technical value and performance of the proposed
engineering\/design approach.    PHASE II: The scope of the Phase II
will be to develop and demonstrate a prototype of the phase I proposed 3
 kW Lightweight Efficient Generator. This demonstration shall show that
the proposed 3 kW Lightweight Efficient Generator designed prototype can
 meet expected performance capabilities in conditions representative of
Army tactical operations. The power unit prototype design should be
based on the evaluation, modification\/upgrade, and integration of
available engines and state of the art alternator, power electronics,
fuel processing techniques, thermal management and composite materials
for packaging. In addition the prototype fabricated should meet all the
requirements for forward deployed equipment and provide the projected
weight savings.      PHASE III: If the technology can meet all the
requirements for forward deployed equipment and provide the projected
weight savings, PM-MEP is willing to consider the potential addition of
this item to our FY14-19 budget. The 3 kW system could fit directly into
 our planned Program of Record for Small Tactical Electric Power (STEP).
  During this phase, three or more prototypes for the 3 kW Lightweight
Efficient Generator will be completed and delivered along with
specification documentation and system drawings.  In addition
documentation that describes the underlying methodologies, approaches,
assumptions, capabilities and limitations will be provided.      The
end-state demonstrated prototypes being researched within this topic
will have dual-use value in commercial and government application.
Potential commercial market applications for this innovation include
Homeland Defense, first-responders, and local and Federal government
organizations.  The vendor is responsible for marketing its demonstrated
 prototype capability for further development and maturation for
potential Post-Phase II transition and integration opportunities
including actual military Programs of Record and any dual-use
applications to other government and industry business areas.",

        "topic_name": "Nonlethal Warhead for Miniature Organic Precision
 Munitions",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this effort is to
develop a non-lethal warhead for use on miniature organic precision
munitions. Non-lethal is defined as a warhead which is not deadly to the
 target personnel but is incapacitating for a period of time. The new
warhead must be modular in nature, self contained and interchangeable
with the standard lethal warhead. This effort will require innovative
research and advancements in non-lethal technologies which can be
packaged within a very small volume and weight.    DESCRIPTION: The
primary objective of this effort is to develop non-lethal warhead
technologies for application to miniature organic precision munitions
such as Lethal Miniature Aerial Munition System (LMAMS). LMAMS is a
small, soldier-carried, soldier-launched loitering precision munitions
system, organic at the small unit level. LMAMS will offer the soldier a
portable, non-line-of-sight precision strike capability against
individual stationary or moving individuals, ensuring high precision
effect from covert positions, with a very low risk of collateral damage.
  LMAMS allows engagement of enemy personnel and soft targets in
urban\/complex environments without exposure to direct enemy fires.  The
 U.S. Army expects the new weapon to weigh around 3 lbs (1.36 kg). The
user will also carry the integrated operating console and communications
 unit, weighing an additional 3 pounds. The entire system could deploy
and be ready to fire within 30 seconds. Once launched, the system should
 be capable to acquire a man-size target at the system"s combat range,
in less than 20 seconds, flying at an altitude of 100 meter above
ground. If conditions for attack are not met, LMAMS will be able to
loiter over the target for up to 30 minutes. For the terminal phase,
LMAMS is designed to hit target within 3.28 ft (1 meter) radius, at
maximum speed of 80  100 mph (35-44m\/sec). This accuracy matches the
warhead"s effectiveness to kill or incapacitate personnel in the open or
 on soft skinned vehicles, within a two meter radius from the point of
detonation.  The current LMAMS payload includes a lethal warhead and
associated fuzing and electronic safe and arm device (ESAD). The user
has expressed a strong need for a non-lethal alternative warhead for
these munitions.     The LMAMS is designed to provide the warfighter
with a"magic bullet".  It can rapidly provide a powerful, but expendable
 miniature flying Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR)
package on a Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) target within minutes. This
miniature, remotely-piloted or autonomous platform can either glide or
propel itself via quiet electric propulsion, providing real-time GPS
coordinates and video for information gathering, targeting, or
feature\/object recognition. The vehicle"s small size and quiet motor
make it difficult to detect, recognize, and track even at very close
range. The LMAMS is fully scalable and can be launched from a variety of
 air and ground platforms.    As a general guide line, the payload
constraints for the non-lethal warhead are:    Size: Should fit into the
 volume: 1.6 x 2.3 x 1.7 inches.    Weight: Not to exceed 380 grams.
Cost:  The non-lethal, modular warhead cost should not exceed $500 per
unit for 500 units.    Fuzing Mechanism: Fuzing will be based on no more

an existing LMAMS mechanism, the details of which will be provided, or
on a new fuzing mechanism, if required by the design of the non-lethal
alternative. If the existing fuzing mechanism is used, then only the
warhead volume described above will be available. If a new fuzing
mechanism is required, then the volume of the warhead above plus the
volume of the fuzing mechanism defined below will be available for the
non-lethal warhead and fuzing mechanism. The volume and weight of the
fuzing mechanism are:    Volume: Should fit into the volume: 1.2 x 1.2 x
 2.1 inches.    Weight: No not to exceed 96 grams.    Cost: Not to
exceed $500 per unit for 500 units.    Non-lethal mechanisms to be
considered may include but are not limited to: mechanical, such as
rubber balls; acoustic; chemical; electrical; or dazzle.    The
non-lethal warhead should be effective against a single individual or up
 to 5 individuals within a radius of 4.25 meters.     PHASE I: Research
and develop non-lethal warhead mechanisms that can be configured within
the given size and weight constraints. Determine and document the
effectiveness of each of the potential approaches considered. Perform
trade studies to select the most effective solution within the given
constraints. The output of Phase I will be a preliminary non-lethal
warhead and fuzing design with effectiveness predictions based on
analysis and simulation. A report documenting the preliminary design and
 analysis will be delivered to the Government.   Simulation codes will
be documented and delivered.      PHASE II: Develop, demonstrate and
document a breadboard design of the non-lethal warhead technology
selected in Phase I. The output of Phase II will be a breadboard design
which conforms to the LMAM interface. The non-lethal effectiveness of
the Phase II breadboard will be demonstrated. The LMAMS interface
conformity will be demonstrated.  All findings and results will be
documented in a report deliverable to the Government.    PHASE III: The
final embodiment of the warhead developed in Phase II will be a flight
hardened, modular device, which will be flight tested on either an LMAMS
 or other similar government furnished miniature organic precision
munition. At this phase of development, which will result in a TRL level
 5 design, warhead effectiveness and flight worthiness will be
demonstrated.  Potential commercial applications might include, but are
not limited to: crowd control for local law enforcement; border
protection for Homeland Security; or temporary incapacitation of non
violent criminals for local SWAT teams and\/or law enforcement.  A final
 report documenting the Phase III designs, findings, and test reports
will be delivered to the Government.",

with cordless battery charging capability while inside a vehicle.
DESCRIPTION: The Nett Warrior uses a battery to power various
Soldier-worn components (e.g., computer, radio, display, etc.).  It is
estimated that 10 watts per Soldier (for a total of nine Soldiers) will
be required to trickle charge the Nett Warrior battery while inside a
vehicle (at a distance of two feet).  Space limitations and the dynamic
nature of the battlefield suggests that carrying extra batteries and
chargers will adversely impact the Soldier's mobility and readiness
while transported by a ground vehicle.  A proximity charger will require
 no extra storage for batteries and should be smaller than regular
battery chargers (no need for battery space\/access); increasing the
mobility of the Soldier by allowing him to keep his gear on while inside
 the vehicle.  No cables would be required to connect to a battery
charger.      PHASE I: This phase will investigate the feasibility of a
cordless battery charging system that can be implemented in an Infantry
Carrier.  It will establish if the state of the art in wireless power
transmission is mature enough and exhibits the necessary efficiencies to
 enable a cost effective implementation of the technology.  The study
will characterize the status of the proposed technology(ies) and present
 a business case of what is currently doable.  The study will address
the limitations of the proposed approach to enable the Government to
determine whether to proceed with a development phase.  The study will
rely on use cases to establish military operational relevancy.  The
study will address size, weight, power and cost characteristics of the
proposed solution, as a minimum.    PHASE II: The objective of this
phase is to design and manufacture a prototype system that will be
installed inside a Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle and will provide 10
 watts each of cordless battery charging capacity to nine Nett Warriors.
  The system will consist of a vehicle mounted component and a
Soldier-borne component.  The specific design requirements will be
provided by the Phase I results.  The contractor will provide 2 vehicle
kits and 12 Soldier-wearable kits.       PHASE III: The end state for
this technology is to become the replacement for battery charging
everywhere (e.g., garrison, vehicle, aircraft, etc.).  This technology
will replace cables and standardize on one interface, potentially being
able to adjust power settings to charge different types of batteries.
Eventually, it will be embedded in commercial electronic devices,
eliminating the need for an adapter.  This effort will support the Nett
Warrior and Air Soldier System programs.  Commercial applications are
numerous; from cell phones to tablets to laptops, etc.",

        "topic_name": "Downrange Crosswind Sensor for Small Arms Fire
Control",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a standalone, downrange
crosswind sensor component capable of measuring the average crosswind
velocity for distances of up to 800 m [(T)hreshold)], [1500 m
(O)bjective] in order to increase first round hit probability.
DESCRIPTION: Accurate wind speed measurements are crucial to military
operations, especially long range small arms engagements.  Crosswind is
one of three major sources of error responsible for reducing the
probability of hit, P(h) of a shooter, and deflection caused by
crosswind is the most dominant factor affecting the flight of a bullet.
 Moderate crosswind velocity as low as 5 m\/s will deviate a bullet
off-course by as much as 1 mil for long range firing (800 meters and
above) requiring a second attempt, which provides the target with the
opportunity to reach defilade and increases the sniper"s own probability
 of detection.      Local changes in the refractive index of air caused
by atmospheric turbulence are quantifiable by remote sensing techniques
which allow measurements of the crosswind velocity.   Both active and
passive methods have been demonstrated and experimentally verified in
the field, with crosswind measurements determined accurately with an
error on the order of the standard deviation of reference measurements.
   Snipers currently have the ability to measure wind at their present
location with handheld anemometers.  Additionally, snipers are trained
to"read the wind"by observing the movements of blades of grass, swaying
tree branches or mirage to estimate the wind mid range and at the target
 and then calculate an average wind speed.  Such methods require a great
 deal of time practicing in order to master.  Further, the practice of
using swaying objects, such as swaying tree branches, lacks accuracy and
 often results in a"best guess"on windage correction.  Fire control
systems are currently under development that provide wind correction
methods into a single fire control system, such as those by US-Israeli
(FOCUS) and DARPA (One Shot) initiatives.  There are currently no
efforts to develop stand-alone wind sensing capability, which is capable
 of both independent operation and interfacing with the next generation
of fire control systems.     The objective of this effort is to develop a
 downrange crosswind measurement system which is significantly
miniaturized (relative to aforementioned current programs), is capable
of independent operation, and has an open architecture to facilitate
integration into future fire control systems should the need arise.
Further, this effort opens the door to exploration of both active and
passive wind sensing capabilities, whereas prior efforts have been
focused all but exclusively on active solutions.    PHASE I: Identify a
method, components and develop system architecture for a remote sensing
device for downrange crosswind measurement in both day and night
operation.  Selected method shall be modeled and simulated to
demonstrate improved crosswind velocity measurements over conventional
methods at ranges of 800m (T) [1500m (O)], in crosswinds of 0 m\/s to 20
 m\/s (gale force wind, per the Beaufort Scale), with a crosswind
measurement error of no more than  1.5 m\/s.  Outlined performance shall
 be achieved in all ambient light conditions (day, night, dawn\/dusk).  A
 report shall be delivered documenting the research, modeling and
components for a laboratory scale device.  Active illumination methods
must assess eye safety requirements.  Expected maturity level at
completion of Phase I is TRL 3.    PHASE II: Develop a proof of concept
breadboard prototype to demonstrate the technologies and capabilities
identified and explored in Phase I. Upon completion and demonstration of
 proof of concept device, further develop the system to reduce the size,
 weight and power (SWAP) of the crosswind sensor such that it weighs no
more than 1.5 lbs (T) [1 lb (O)], does not occupy a volume larger than
0.7 L (T) [0.5 L (O)], and operates on common U.S. Army inventory
batteries (T), [AA or CR123 batteries (O)].  Developed prototype
analysis shall include average crosswind velocity measurements in a
relevant environment compared to measurements made by conventional wind
estimation methods, for example, sniper wind estimation techniques or
hand held local wind speed sensors.  Expected maturity level at
completion of Phase II is TRL 5.    PHASE III: Upon successful
completion of the research and development in Phase I and Phase II, the
new system will be capable to be fielded as a clip-on or weapon
mountable device (MIL-STD-1913, Picatinny Rail) and provide a known
interface in order to be integrated into fire control systems under
development.  Dual use applications include use in wind energy
generation, determining crosswind at airports, free space optical
communications and monitoring the drift of chemical, biological and
radioactive agents.  Expected maturity level at completion of Phase III
is TRL 7.",

        "topic_name": "Novel Planning Algorithms for Hybrid Land and Sea
 Platform Sensor Coordination",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  This Topic seeks research and
development of innovative planning algorithms toward improving sensor
coordination of a hybrid Aegis BMD System. The result of this effort
should be adaptable planning algorithms that recommend options for
optimizing Ship Operating Area (SOA) toward defending a given area
against a missile raid (multiple targets).  Research should include, but
 not be limited to, exploring concepts of advanced learning, sensor
coordination and adaptive applications (i.e., Bioinspired algorithm for
managing the sensor resources, Information-Based Decision Making and
others)         DESCRIPTION:  Existing planners use sensor kinematic
models together with selected geographic constraints that provide
support in determining the placement\/SOA for Sea-based assets.  As more
 assets become available, and particularly in the case where some are
Earth fixed and others are mobile, existing approaches need to become
real-time adaptable and optimal.  This becomes increasingly critical
when these assets are planning for a coordinated raid of threats
launched in close proximity and closely in time.  As a result, the
Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is seeking the development of novel, highly
 effective planning algorithms and associated models to provide optimal
positioning solutions for a hybrid Aegis BMD system comprised of both
land-based and sea-based assets.  These algorithms must take into
account operational constraints of each sensor asset type, and produce
optimal yet adaptable Sea-based positioning solutions in real time.
      The focus should be on developing an adaptable planning algorithm
that would optimize SOA when incorporating land based and mobile sensor
sources to handle a raid environment (multiple targets). These new
planning algorithms must be able to recommend sensor assets that
minimize the number of required sensors for a given coverage, maximize
the effectiveness of each sensor given its performance and resource
constraints, and optimize the probability of successful engagements
(Pes) for each Aegis BMD firing asset (whether land-based or sea-based).
  Generic Aegis BMD Data will be provided that will assist the small
business in this effort.    When a single sensor is tasked with
collecting measurements on a single target, the management of the
sensor's available resources does not pose any challenge. However, in
situations where multiple sensors are directed to collect measurements
on multiple targets, the decision process that determines which sensors
to collect measurements on within a given area to cover can be
difficult. The sensor coordination\/management problem becomes more
difficult as the number of targets relative to the number of sensors
increases. The problem is further exacerbated when targets and sensors
are not arranged in a favorable geometric position [1].  Innovative
concepts and models should be explored and proposed that would optimize
planning for engagement success.    Things to consider toward developing
 these models are minimizing required sensor resources in a threat raid
environment, minimizing the probability of target leakage and maximizing
 target raid annihilation.  These models should potentially be
applicable to other BMDS (Ballistic Missile Denfense System) weapon
systems such as THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense), GMD
(Ground-Based Midcourse Defense) and PATRIOT (Phased Array Tracking
Radar to Intercept on Target).          PHASE I:  Develop noval planning
 algorithms for positioning sea-based assets, that includes adding land
based sensor assets along with other mobile sensor assets, which is
geared toward defending a given area against a missile raid (multiple
targets).  These algorithms should determine the optimal positioning of
land-based and sea-based BMD assets such as generic S-band and X-band
radars, interceptors of various capabilities, notional IR sensors and
any required communication relays to cover a given defended area.
 Develop a proof of concept design; identify designs and test
capabilities and conduct feasibility assessment for the proposed
algorithms. Phase I work should clearly validate the viability of the
proposed solution.  Phase I should also result in a clear concept of
operations document.          PHASE II:  Based on the results and
findings of Phase I, utilize Aegis BMD assets as an intial testbed to
develop the planning models that can provide calculated and graphical
output of optimal placement for Aegis BMD assets.  After development of
the planning algorithms, exercise the models using real world data,
including actual Aegis BMD asset characteristics.  Planning algorithms
should be scalable to other BMDS platforms such as GMD and THAAD.
   The Phase II objective will be to validate a new technology solution
that MDA users and prime contractors can transition in Phase III.
Validate the feasibility of the Phase I concept by development and
demonstrations that will be tested to ensure performance objectives are
met.  Validation would include, but not be limited to, system
simulations, operation in test-beds, or operation in a demonstration
subsystem. The goal of the Phase II effort is to demonstrate technology
solution viability.          PHASE III:  In this phase, the contractor
will apply the innovations demonstrated in the first two phases to one
or more MDA systems, subsystems, or components. The objective of Phase
III is to demonstrate the scalability of the developed technology,
transition the component technology to the MDA system integrator or
payload contractor, mature it for operational insertion, and demonstrate
 the technology in an operational level environment.

various technologies and models developed in Phase II for potential

systems, and other tracking applications.",

characteristics and processing algorithms that will deduce
sensor-invariant attributes of a tracked object so that it can be
classified, discriminated and evaluated for engagement.  Physics-based
approaches are sought for broadest utility and general applicability.
     DESCRIPTION:  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is seeking the
development of enhanced radio frequency (RF) signal waveform
characteristics and associated processing algorithms to improve Aegis
BMD engagement capability in raid environments.  Tracking information
beyond target position and velocity is needed to discern
sensor-independent taxonomy of missile threats and the intent of closely
 spaced targets.        To date most RF techniques have concentrated on
target detection and tracking (i.e., position and velocity over time).
Employing novel RF waveform characteristics such as modulation, timing
and phasing to deduce other target characteristics such as its
reflective, emissive, inertial and material properties could
significantly enhance radar effectiveness and increase the probability
of engagement success.  To be most effective, however, new RF waveform
characteristics should require minimal changes to the radar hardware and
 use RF data processing algorithms that can be implemented in existing
signal processors.        Although enhanced RF data processing
algorithms specific to Aegis may be able to provide some additional
target characteristics, the approach for this effort should be primarily
 physics-based (i.e., centered on the use of novel RF waveform
characteristics) for broadest utility and general applicability.
  PHASE I:  Develop and Design new RF waveforms with novel
characteristics that can help deduce target characteristics beyond just
position and velocity.  Develop a non-operational model showing how the
new RF waveform characteristics can deduce such target characteristics
as reflectivity, emissive properties, material construction, and others
characteristics. Include the associated processing algorithms that will
support the new RF waveforms.        These new RF waveform
characteristics must be largely compatible with the existing AN\/SPY-1
radar, and the associated algorithms must be supported using existing
Aegis BMD signal processing capabilities.     The output of the Phase I
shall be a proof of concept design\/study; identify designs\/models and

 model, technique, and\/or methods. Phase I work should clearly validate
 the viability of the proposed solution. Phase I should also result in a
 clear concept of operations document.          PHASE II:  Based on the
results and findings of Phase I, develop and refine the novel RF
waveform designs, increase the capabilities of the associated
algorithms, and exercise the enhanced non-operational model to evaluate
the effectiveness of the new RF waveforms.  Then demonstrate the
capability of an operational or a slightly modified SPY-1 radar to
support the new RF waveforms during target detection and tracking, and
measure any increase in overall radar effectiveness.        The Phase II

DESCRIPTION:  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is seeking the
development of novel RF modulation, timing and phasing as well as
orthogonal and bi-static arrangements to increase Aegis BMD
compatibility with evolving civilian 3G and 4G communication systems
worldwide.  This effort should include the development of advanced

these novel RF changes, advanced algorithms and enhanced signal

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To develop system optimization
algorithms to enable effective fire control solutions in challenging
environments. Design a procedure to task the right sensor at the right
time for a selected target.    DESCRIPTION: Given a diverse inventory of
 missile assets, as well as a sensor suite that may be able to view the
target from different viewing angles, phenomenologies, accuracies and
timelines, determine which sensor(s) can best obtain the required track
quality for a selected interceptor. Of particular interest are raid
scenarios where multiple targets need to be engaged, sensor assets may
be heavily loaded and must be managed efficiently and interceptor
inventory must be utilized wisely. The intelligent sensor - weapon
pairing will enable the collection of requisite information for launch,
track, and discrimination given the missile system capability, flyout
profile and timeline.    For the Phased Adaptive Approach, the BMDS is
focusing on more complex engagements to achieve capabilities against
MRBMs, IRBMS and LRBMs using Aegis Weapon System missiles or GBI, as
well as sensors including AN\/TPY-2 and PTSS. The system, with a small
number of sensors, will be required to handle potentially hundreds of
objects and it is critical that the sensors be tasked to provide quality
 launch information for a given target to the weapon system to enable
efficient threat destruction with minimal wastage of resources. This
effort addresses the sensor tasking assignment and raid resource
optimization needs of C2BMC.    Asset pairing is related to sensor
resource management, weapon resource management, resource optimization
and fire control.  However, for this solicitation, we are looking for
increased efficiencies when the sensor selection is a function of the
weapons and their geometries, capabilities and timelines. Sensor
resource management has been exhaustively studied with respect to
obtaining adequate track quality, when a weapon has been selected and
the timeline is known. This development has led to a performance gap,
with sensors and weapons being optimized separately instead of jointly.
This task seeks to wring out greater efficiencies when optimizing for
the engagement instead of compartmentalizing the functions to optimize
separately. This joint optimization approach has not been investigated
for the missile defense arena, and we seek to develop innovative
solutions, as well as leverage past efforts, to expand the scope to
optimizing system performance.    The researcher may assume that,
although the targets are dynamic, their positions can be estimated to a
given degree of accuracy.  Some sensors may be stationary, and some may
be dynamic, but any motions will be known. The flyout basket for a given
 interceptor and weapon system can be assumed known. Some sensors will
view one target, some will be able to view many, but Field of View (FOV)
 will be known for each sensor, as well as response time. Given a window
 of potential engagement, the researcher can decide when to engage
within that timeline.  It can also be assumed that the tracks will be
successfully correlated between sensors.    PHASE I:  Develop and
demonstrate feasibility of the proposed sensor  weapon pairing
algorithms for fixed site radar sensors and a simple satellite
constellation, and a moderate number of tracked objects. The algorithm
shall take a given set of target trajectories, sensors and weapon
systems, with flyout windows for each missile (ownship) and engagement
type, and determine which sensors are assigned to which weapon systems
(multiple Aegis ships) to engage which targets with timing optimized for
 track quality and engagement.    PHASE II: Refine and update concept(s)
 based on Phase I results and demonstrate the proof of principle
technology in a realistic environment using agency provided engagements.
  Demonstrate the technology"s ability real-time in a stressed
environment; with few sensors, and many targets.  A government testbed
will be available at no cost if the scientist wishes to utilize the
facility for high fidelity testing.    PHASE III:  Demonstrate the new
technologies via operation as part of a complete system or operation in a
 system-level test bed to allow for testing and evaluation in realistic
scenarios.  Market technologies developed under this solicitation to
relevant missile defense elements directly, or transition them through
vendors.    COMMERICALIZATION: The contractor will pursue
commercialization of the various technologies and optimization
components developed in Phase II for potential commercial and military
uses in many areas such as automated processing, robotics, medical
industry, and in manufacturing processes.",

Correlation",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To develop new methods for
multi-sensor target handover and characterization.    DESCRIPTION: For
radars fielded by the Missile Defense System, there is a given set of
available features that were developed for acquisition, track and
discrimination of targets. Similarly, for electro-optic\/infrared
sensors there are standard features which have been developed for
acquisition, track and discrimination. These features may not be the
optimal features for target correlation between sensors. Thus, this task
 seeks the development of either innovative new features to aid
multi-sensor track correlation, or innovative data fusion techniques
with the existing features to aid correlation. Additionally, realizing
that the RF features for discrimination exploit a given set of target
attributes, and similarly for the EOIR, we seek innovative data fusion
processes to better characterize the target.     The first subtask,
correlation of objects between sensors, is a very important handover
function in multi-sensor, multi-target data fusion, particularly when
sensors are sparse and overlapping coverage may not occur. This can
become complicated when different types of sensor systems (RF versus
EOIR) are viewing the same objects. Success in this subtask will be a
demonstration of improved handover, compared with a metric only
procedure, from EO\/IR to RF sensors and from RF to EO\/IR, when
multiple objects are in the respective scenes. Appropriate sensor
geometries with respect to target will need to be considered.    The
second, or alternate, subtask will be the development of data fusion
techniques to combine  information from the disparate sensors -  to
understand the appropriate contributions to target identity from the
various sources. Object classification schemes may be considered,
however, they must be robust to objects not in the training set, and
various subsets of available features. Other techniques, such as Bayes
net approaches or influence diagrams, are also welcome to explore
innovative, robust methods for target characterization from multi-sensor
 features. Success will be a demonstration of target characterization in
 RF, in EO\/IR, then together, to demonstrate how a target can be more
accurately characterized using a combination of RF and EO\/IR
measurements.    Previous efforts have not dealt with the long ranges
and specific available features for the MDA engagement for data fusion,
and correlation is a major outstanding challenge. EOIR sensors are
relatively new to the sensor suite for MDA, as well, and present new
challenges for exploitation.    The researcher may include multiple
EO\/IR bands as well as several radar frequencies, if desired in their
analyses. However, targets will be at ranges that will cause them to
appear on, at most, one pixel for the EO\/IR focal plane.    PHASE I:
Develop and demonstrate, through proof-of-principle tests, target
correlation or characterization improvements using measurement data from
 disparate sensors.     PHASE II: Refine and update concept(s) based on
Phase I results and demonstrate the technology in a realistic
environment using agency provided engagements.  Demonstrate the
technology"s ability real-time in a stressed environment; with few
sensors, and many targets.    PHASE III:  Demonstrate the new
technologies via operation as part of a complete system or operation in a
 system-level test bed to allow for testing and evaluation in realistic
scenarios.  Market technologies developed under this solicitation to
relevant missile defense elements directly, or transition them through
vendors.    COMMERICALIZATION: The contractor will pursue
commercialization of the various technologies and optimization
components developed in Phase II for potential commercial and military
uses in many areas such as automated processing, robotics, medical
industry, and in manufacturing processes.",

Sensors - Development of a zero power\/ultra-low power x-ray sensing
technology for use at the printed circuit board level or integrated
circuit level, for the protection of critical technology from
exploitation.         DESCRIPTION:  The Agency has issued a directive
necessitating the protection of Critical Program Information (CPI) from
unintentional transfer and the policy for the implementation of
Anti-Tamper (AT) technology on MDA acquisition and associated technology
 programs.  AT technology consists of engineering activities that result
 in the prevention and\/or delayed exploitation of critical technologies
 in U.S. weapons systems.  The purpose is to add longevity to critical
technology by deterring efforts to reverse-engineer, exploit, or develop
 countermeasures against a system or component.  Though the particular
solution may be tailored for individual applications, the concept and
methodology of the solution should be applicable to various Commercial
Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and military hardware.  Preference will be given to
 solutions that provide protection for Critical Technologies without
introducing additional risks or costs to the weapon platform and its
mission.  Additionally, attention will be focused on a low (or no) power
 requirement; the covertness of the technology; personal and mission
safety; minimal impact to semiconductor manufacturing processes; minimal
 impact to system availability and maintainability; and seamless
integration in the BMDS weapon platform.  As a result, the MDA will
maintain a technological edge in support of the warfighter.
Recent developments in nanotechnology sensors and
micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) [1-8] offer opportunities for
creating ultra-low power sensors to detect tampering and reverse
engineering.  The purpose of this SBIR is to develop tampering\/reverse
engineering x-ray sensors for the printed circuit board or integrated
circuit level, that require zero power or near zero power (in the 0.1 to
 1 microwatt range).  Energy harvesting technologies may be used in
conjunction with the development of ultra-low power x-ray sensor
technologies, but must constitute less than 20% of the development
effort.  Sensor orientation effects must be considered in the
development.  MDA is not interested in the utilization of low duty cycle
 sensors to reduce power consumption (e.g. 1 % duty cycle at 0.1
milliwatts gives 1 microwatt average power consumption).  Additionally,
MDA is not interested in materials that require visual inspection for
tamper detection, nor in material coatings for printed circuit boards or
 integrated circuits.  Participation in this SBIR is limited to US
citizens and US persons.           PHASE I:  Research and develop a

Characterization",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop an innovative, low cost
approach to capture full-hemisphere, open-air, fragment mass, geometry
and velocity information during arena and sled warhead characterization
tests.        DESCRIPTION:  MDA is interested in developing techniques
to improve the data collection, decrease the time required, and reduce
the cost associated with performing ground-based warhead
characterization.  Warhead characterization tests adhere to the
guidelines and procedures described in the Joint Munitions Effectiveness
 Manual (JMEM).  The present method of warhead characterization is
costly, labor intensive, and produces only a small amount of the
required data.  For arena tests, a warhead is placed in the center of an
 arena consisting of any combination of blast-pressure gages and
fragment collection media.  Fragment collection media (often celotex
bundles) placed behind"switch screens"are placed just above ground level
 and arc around the warhead at a radius that is a function of the net
explosive weight.  These screens record the time of impact for the
fragments that make contact with the screens and the fragments are
captured in the celotex material for subsequent measurement (weight,
shape) and analysis.  While the bundle radius ensures their survival
during blast-pressure impingement, the celotex bundles occupy only a
small slice of the total hemisphere.  As such, only a fraction of the
fragments are captured for inclusion in the subsequent warhead
characterization analysis.  Weeks of tedious and error-prone labor are
necessary to locate, recover, weigh, and describe the geometry of each
fragment entering the bundles.  Many small fragments are not recovered
and few if any individual fragments recovered are mapped to their
specific velocities or switch screen entry points\/times. In order to
develop a more-complete dataset for user consumption, raw warhead test
data is subjected to a series of assumptions, averages, rotations, and
summarizations to produce an approximation of the true warhead's
fragment mass and velocity field.  While checks and balances are in
place to assure that overall data appear reasonable, individual fragment
 masses\/geometries remain uncoupled from their velocities and many of
the smaller fragments are simply not included in the dataset.
All warhead characterizations (and data reduction methods) performed to
date have been conservatively-skewed based on a lethality-mindset. As
such, true munitions lethalities are higher than is indicated by their
arena test scores. This is diametrically opposed to the collateral
damage mindset of the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) and the
requirement to obtain higher fidelity warhead fragmentation\/debris data
 for much of the current inventory of fielded weapons. Current
procedures make high-fidelity re-test prohibitively time consuming,
expensive, and technically problematic.  Delays in missions can result
where high casualties or collateral damage are estimated.        MDA

and Resulting Debris\/Shrapnel Generation from Submunitions Warheads",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop an innovative, low cost,
approach to testing and modeling the HE submunition warhead response for
 hit-to-kill missile interceptors leveraging first-principle physics
methodologies.  Modeling of the high and low order HE response should be
 addressed to assess detonation probability.   The selected approach
must address HE response to the kinetic energy intercept as well as the
material fragmentation.   Post-intercept debris generation
characteristics (mass, shape, velocity) must also be captured.  The
methodology employed must be capable of receiving detailed target and
penetrator \/ interceptor models and returning each fragment's geometry,
 fragment velocity and mass information.    DESCRIPTION:  A primary kill
 mechanism for the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) systems
against weapons carrying high explosives is the detonation of the
explosive.  Many warhead types have been analyzed and modeled using
first-principle techniques, however determining the full spectrum of
possible responses of HE submuntions \/ weapons is poorly understood.
Experimental test data that captures the various types of response is
very limited or not found in existing databases.  Submunition warheads
present a challenge to penetrator\/interceptors due to packaging,
compartmentalized nature of individual warheads,hardened casings and
material construction design techniques.      Hit-to-kill BMD systems
(AEGIS, THAAD, PAC-3, GMD) have steadily increased their use of high
fidelity modeling techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of their
systems for predicting shock-to-detonation (STD) phenomena.  The current
 modeling capability does not fully cover reactive events of non-STD
nature for threat-relevant submunition warheads.  MDA desires a tool to
better model HE responses such as unknown-to-detonation (XDT) and
deflagration-to-detonation (DDT) events.  Physics-based simulation
outputs should include lethality estimates (per submunition warhead) and
 post-intercept debris predictions.  This first-principles modeling
capability would provide enhancements to the MDA lethality models (KIDD
and PEELS) to better capture the range of HE detonation reactions and
resulting debris. The modeling techniques and software tools developed
under this program must be sufficiently anchored to relevant test data.
        PHASE I:  Develop an approach for modeling hyper-velocity
intercepts of HE submunition warheads that leverages first-principle
physics modeling techniques.  Conduct sample calculations using
representative (simplified) geometries.  Develop a plan for a low cost
and innovative HE testing approach. Research existing test data that can
 be utilized for benchmarking of the simulation methodology and begin to
 identify innovative tests and data collection to fill gaps in the
existing data set.        PHASE II:  Further develop techniques within
the first-principle codes to enable modeling of the required
phenomenology.  Anchor the code predictions to existing test data and
refine the model as needed.   Begin extension of the modeling capability
 to threat-representative geometries for both unitary submunition
warheads and full payload geometries.  Plan and execute new tests to
define HE reactions and submunition warhead geometries as needed to fill
 gaps.        PHASE III:  Transition the first-principle physics-based
modeling capability developed under this program to MDA lethality and
debris prediction tools (e.g. PEELS and KIDD, respectively).
Simplification of the techniques developed here is necessary to support
fast-running engineering codes.          COMMERCIALIZATION:  This
technology would benefit Insensitive Munitions testing of reactive
materials (HE and propellants) and other DoD weapon program modeling and
 simulation.  EOD and safety transport and disposal of munitions and
other explosives could leverage this information to better perform these
 missions.",

Debris Aero-heating and Aero-thermal Demise",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop an approach for assessing
the aero-thermal demise of the debris generated following a ballistic
missile defense intercept        DESCRIPTION:  The intercept of a
ballistic missile at high altitudes generates thousands of debris
fragments, ranging in size from less than a millimeter to tens of
centimeters.  These pieces typically re-enter the atmosphere, and may or
 may not burn up before they strike the Earth.  Assessment of this
aero-thermal demise phenomenon can thus have a significant effect on
sensor performance (discrimination, tracking, sensor loading, etc),
particularly for lower-tier elements, consequences of intercept, as well
 as range safety issues for flight tests.        Whether or not a
particular fragment survives re-entry depends on a variety of factors,
including the fragment (linear and angular) velocity just after
intercept, the aerodynamic characteristics of the fragment, and the
fragment material.  The aerodynamic characteristics, in turn, are
strongly coupled to the trajectory described by the fragment after the
intercept.  Most of these fragments are highly irregular in shape;
therefore, simple analytical models are likely insufficient to predict
the aerodynamic heating they experience.  First-principles numerical
techniques, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), could in theory
be used to predict the aero-thermodynamic environment around each
fragment.  However, the time required per fragment for CFD grid
generation and trajectory-coupled flow solution, combined with the large
 number of fragments associated with a single intercept, makes
a"full-blown"CFD approach an impractical choice for supporting
consequence management, scenario planning, and other high-level
assessment functions.        In light of the above observations, an
approach is desired that incorporates a physics-based aerodynamic
heating methodology into an aerodynamic trajectory framework capable of
producing rapid predictions for large debris sets.  The desired
methodology must meet a number of requirements:  (1) it must utilize
realistic debris geometry, and not be restricted to simple geometric
constructions; (2) it must be compatible with existing tools for debris
generation and debris propagation; (3) it must be capable of extension
to coupled phenomena such as surface recession; (4) it must be
applicable to the full range of altitude and velocity regimes
experienced during debris fly-down, from rarefied hypersonic to
continuum supersonic\/subsonic; (5) it must benchmarked using existing
test data.           PHASE I:  Formulate an approach for predicting
intercept debris aerodynamic heating and break-up that meets the
requirements listed above.  Perform proof-of-principle calculations
using this approach for simple shapes, such as spheres and flat plates.
 Compare these predictions to high-fidelity results, theory, and\/or
test data.        PHASE II:  Perform further demonstration of the
methodology proposed in Phase I through application to arbitrary
fragment geometries.  These results may be validated through comparison
to test data (if available) or body-fitted CFD results.  Integrate the
validated aero-thermal analysis approach into an existing tool for
intercept debris propagation, and apply it to a representative set of
realistic debris.  This debris set will be supplied from a high-fidelity
 finite-element calculation of a BMD engagement or flight test event.
     PHASE III:  Extend and enhance the combined algorithm so that it
can be used to provide more accurate debris footprints for a variety of
BMDS functions.  These would include debris mitigation measures for
lower-tier elements, general consequence management and flight test
range safety.         COMMERCIALIZATION:  Benefits to DoD, NASA, the
commercial launch industry to understand if failed launches, or range
safety launches, or re-entering orbital platforms will be a threat to
air and ground based assets.",

and simulation and, in turn, design of antennas in a re-entry
environment. Specifically, the goal is for a tool that provides the
coupled prediction of the antenna performance in a plasma sheath.
 DESCRIPTION:  The Missile Defense Agency flies a variety of ballistic
missile targets for all elements of the Ballistic Missile Defense
System. Depending on the individual test objectives, it may be necessary
 to fly a missile into the endo-atmosphere where the plasma environments
 can impede TM&amp;GPS communication. Plasma sheaths envelop portions or
 the entirety of the vehicle and effectively shield the antennas from
proper operation. A variety of solution techniques exist for the
development of antennas which perform in the plasma environment. These
techniques vary from antenna placement to matching scenarios, etc.  In
the BMDS target development arena, expensive testing to characterize
plasma environments and subsequent design loops for antennas is not
possible. It is instead desirable to develop an antenna design tool that
 can predict the plasma environment and the antennas operation in it.
The goal is a coupled Computational Electro-Magnetic \/ Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CEM\/CFD) tool that predicts the plasma environment and
the antenna (including the impact of the antenna and associated transmit
 power on the plasma environment). The tool must provide detailed
antenna modeling for generic antenna designs on the re-entry body.
   The end result tool could then be coupled with traditional or
advanced antenna techniques to design antennas which would then be able
to support maintaining data link throughout re-entry. Alternatively, it
could enable the selection of ground telemetry asset locations as to
minimize impact of the plasma sheath of telemetry coverage.

 The Missile Defense Agency produces many composite materials in
applications spanning the breadth of the agency. Composite structures
and layups play an important role in a variety of sensor and weapon
system platforms. Composite structures and layups are also an important
part of Missile Defense targets. These composite layups include thermal
protection systems, motor casings, etc. Flaws in target composites may
either be structural (disbonds, inclusions, or voids) as well as RF
(unexpected complex permittivity or permeability).      Current methods
of non-destructive evaluation for composites vary. Some, such
as"tap"tests, rely on human training to identify issues. Other tests
such as X-ray or ultrasonic testing can produce good data with respect
to structural issues but cannot identify issues in material make-up
resulting in unexpected RF performance characteristics.      The goal is
 the development of an inexpensive and effective means of assessing for
most structural issues while simultaneously checking material layer
thickness and RF material properties. The RF material property
measurement requirement is complicated by the need for RF material
properties on each individual layer in contract to a composite"effective
 permittivity"for a material stack to enable high-fidelity modeling.

roughly larger than a nickel.        The final NDE system should be

voids as a threshold and disbands as a goal. Further, the system should
be able to identify RF material properties (permittivity and
permeability) for individual layers in a multi-layer material stack. The
 system should also be able to identify material layer thicknesses for
manufacturing verification. Demonstrate the performance of the system to
 perform all of these functions through modeling and simulation.

testing of the system and proceed to development tests in the field.

        "topic_name": "Advanced Techniques for Lossless Compression of
Target Vehicle Telemetry",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Help offset the limited bandwidth
for vehicle telemetry against the increasing requests for addition
telemetered truth information by using new mathematical techniques
developed for video and audio or related applications and applying to
telemetry encoding.  A generalized methodology which can be adapted to
imagery, health and status information, inertial measurement or global
positioning system (GPS) position and orientation data is highly
desirable but targeted approaches which are optimal for specific
heterogeneous data streams but have low computational overhead and
rigorous error-rejection are also sought.        DESCRIPTION:  As target
 flight tests become increasingly complex to fully exercise BMDS
functionality and anchor performance, the amount of information being
downlinked from target and interceptor vehicles creates significant
logistical challenges simply due to bandwidth needs.  Currently while
some limited compression is in use, there is no broadly employed
standard which can address the reduction of TM bandwidth across a full
suite of MDA Target test vehicles.  Generally data is PCM encoded and
often the data has to be encrypted for security reasons. This
solicitation is intended to provide the Missile Defense Agency (MDA)
with techniques based on both traditional methods and latest art
designed for applications in streaming on-line content and cyber data
security.        There are several factors which complicate the
implementation of data compression in the MDA flight test environment.
There are multiple target providers, multiple target vehicles and
significant flight to flight variance in terms of available bandwidth
and desired data.  Possibly the primary challenges is the diversity of
potential information and the increasingly demanding rates which must be
 supported.  In addition, due to the costs of doing even a single flight
 test it is critical that all information be collected with the highest
reliability and the lowest potential for loss of information upon
correction.  In the case of off-nominal flight conditions or anomalous
events in flight, it is impossible to know a priori which channels of
data will be most critical post-flight.  As a result there is a high
priority on maintaining the integrity of the data and assuring accurate
transmission of all data streams. Typical types of data include:
1) Health and Status information on the motor, electronics, internal
systems, payloads, etc. typically collected at 100Hz rates.    2)
Imagery, visible, IR which may or may not be calibrated, typically
collected at 10-50Hz rates.    3) Thermal sensor data including
reference junction temperatures, as many as 100 sensors typically
collected at 100Hz.      4) Body kinematic information in various forms
at 100Hz rates.      5) Furthermore any or all of the data may be
encrypted due to classification or information protection requirements.
       The data is typically assembled on the ground as post-processed
files with IRIG time information and various data channels. Calibration
factors are applied on the ground.        A successful approach must
meet certain criteria.      1)  Low Computational Overhead: on-board
processing is typically limited.        2)  Readily transportable to
different processors. The concept must be able to be adaptable to
different flight vehicles and flight computers        3)  Lossless
compression. While the standards of this will vary depending on the data
 stream in question for some values, including imagery, it may be
critical to completely and rigorously reconstruct the precise
radiometric scene.  This would be on an item by item basis but lossless
compression must be available as an option for any stream.         4)
Low latency. While some computational delay is expected the telemetry
data in the moments in advance of a failure, intercept, anomaly or other
 instantaneous event are often of the highest interest. As a result,
latencies on the order .01 seconds are desired.        5)  Overall
telemetered data footprint reduction on the order of 5x or greater but
smaller compression amounts are to be expected for different data types
and techniques which meet all criteria but achieve lower overall
compression are still of interest.          6)  Robustness under
compression.  Typically data is compressed before encryption but this
can reduce the security level of the telemetered data due to predicable
patterns put into the compressed data which can make cryptanalysis
easier.  Since it may be possible to protect any specific details of
implemented algorithms as classified, high consideration will be given
for specialized models which can maintain performance and security of
national security information.        7)  Simplicity is a goal.  Since
algorithms are generally tailored for specific types of data, a
multi-algorithm approach is useful but a successful solution will cover
all types of expected data and will contain the simplest implementation
as possible.    For the tasks in all Phases of development, telemetry
streams at the appropriate classification level and reflecting the
program needs and requirements will be provided to all awardees as
Government Furnished Information (GFI).  Performance will be judged
based on compression amounts, data loss\/degradation and computational
efficiency as criteria for progress from Phase I to Phase II or Phase II
 to follow-on work.          PHASE I:  Demonstrate the feasibility of
the proposed approach on the GFI data sets. Provide statistics on
compress ratio, computation time\/latency, processor compatibility, and
applicability to the different data streams and types.  Imagery data in
particular can be extremely challenging for downlinking, successful
proposals will include some treatment of this type of data.  While
classified data will not be supplied, Phase 1 work should also address
the potential for dealing with encrypted data and a projection of
expected performance.        PHASE II:  In Phase II representative
encrypted data will be provided GFI along with a complete data stream
for processing and scoring. Once demonstrated for these classes of data
the contractor will provide a post-flight a postiori data compression
using hardware in the government Tech Team laboratory which will be
reduced by the government as would flight TM and compared to the results
 obtained on mission day.         After this a fully or partially
encrypted data will be tested in the same facility and used for final
evaluation.        Additional interchanges with prime target providers
will be held. Phase II software interfaces for integration into target
provider launch vehicles will be identified and fully documented in the
Phase II final report.          PHASE III:  Phase III will involve the
successful integration and implementation of the compression software
(or hardware\/software solution) in live flight (real time) conditions
in a piggy-back mode.  Results will be compared to ground test results
and to official truth data products. This will require a teaming
arrangement and a path for tech transfer into industry directly at the
end of Phase III.  Either a follow-on test will run on board in real
time for a flight test using fully or partially encrypted data or
depending on logistics the initial real time test will be conducted for
encrypted data streams            COMMERCIALIZATION:  The contractor
will pursue commercialization of the various technologies developed in
Phase II for potential commercial uses in such diverse fields as
methodology and tool development for DoD. The commercialization for MDA
Targets may come from teaming arrangements reached between the algorithm
 provider and target prime contractors.  In addition, it is expected
that if successful for encrypted data there will be substantial other
applications within the DoD in MDA, Space Surveillance and other
organizations.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is
seeking innovative concepts and products to improve the safety and
logistics challenges of hypergolic propellant based propulsion systems.
This includes sensor technology and leak mitigation technologies. The
overall goal of projects selected under this topic will be to develop
and demonstrate innovative technologies to enable safe storage and
deployment of liquid hypergolic propulsion (LHP) systems for ballistic
missile defense interceptors.  Specifically this research and
development goal is to develop a modular Hypergolic leak detector that
has the capability to be reconfigured depending upon the detections
requirement at hand.  This year"s effort is a focused development of
high reliability, low power and low cost transducer element that would
be able to detect rapid changes in concentration of hypergolic fuels and
 oxidizers for use within a tactical Leak Detection Subsystem.
DESCRIPTION:  A number of fielded missile systems use hypergolic fuels
and oxidizers as a means of propulsion. A significant shortfall in this
area is the inability to accurately verify any leaks of the hypergolic
fuels or oxidizers. The key to the utility of this detector is not only a
 low threshold for detection, but reliable and accurate detection of the
 target contaminant in all required environments. A true"leak"of
significance should result in a fairly rapid change in the concentration
 of the target chemical inside the canister. Once a threshold for a
target contaminant has been reached, the transducer would change states
to activate a separate alarm device. The chemicals the unit should be
sensitive to include any of the common Hypergolic rocket fuels and
oxidizers, which include but are not limited to Monomethyl Hydrazine,
MON-25, and others. The maximum threshold for a target contaminant shall
 be less than 100 ppm at all required environments.        The
Hypergolic Chemical Transducer (HCT) shall be a small compact device
less than one inch in diameter and two inches in length including all
external interfaces for both wired and wireless connection. The HCT
shall be a very low power device capable of being battery powered and
using less than 0.3 milli-watts average (",

        "topic_name": "Acquisition, Tracking and Pointing Technologies
for High Energy Laser Applications",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate advanced and
 innovative components, algorithms and electronics supporting next
generation acquisition, tracking and pointing (ATP) sensor and jitter
control technologies to provide support to future missile defense
missions using significantly less components than traditional
applications.  Even though ATP is a broad topic, the MDA focus areas for
 this year are listed by priority below.      Offerors MUST direct their
 proposal to one of the three topic areas otherwise, the proposal will
be non-compliant.  If the offeror has a question or clarification, they
are highly encouraged to contact the topic authors to discuss the
subject before submitting a proposal.      The three (3) focus areas
corresponding to this topic arranged by priority are:      Focus Area I:
 Low noise, high sensitivity and high bandwidth detector arrays used to
collect and count electrons with mission applicable quantum efficiency.
 Low noise, high sensitivity, high bandwidth detector arrays are of
absolute importance for future ATP missions.  The ability to accurately
capture and count electrons from a source is critical for more effective
 tracking capabilities in high altitude environments.  The predicted
area of performance will be in the 1 micrometer wavelength realm.
Focus Area II: Airborne hyper-spectral sensors for ballistic and
airborne target applications able to detect short, mid and long
wavelengths.  The hyper-spectral sensor"s algorithm should be able to
integrate the different wavelengths and output a combined image.
Airborne hyper-spectral sensor for ballistic and airborne targets is
another important ATP technology which will provide future programs with
 exceptional capabilities such as target identification.  The
hyper-spectral sensor should be able to integrate the sensed wavelengths
 into one coherent image for this purpose.    Focus Area III: Jitter
suppression algorithms and their requisite supporting control
electronics to utilize and control jitter through the optical train.
These technologies include but are not limited to fast steering mirrors,
 optical inertial reference units, inertial sensors for precision
pointing and inertial stabilization, optical sensors for jitter and\/or
image stabilization, algorithms and control electronics\/processors.
Jitter suppression is required on several Missile Defense Agency (MDA)
systems including future interceptor concepts. The ability to accurately
 track an object of interest from a platform undergoing base motion
disturbances due to system operations is critical. The interest remains
in ATP technologies that will allow higher performance tracking and
pointing in realistic environments. Sub-microradian performance is
required for many missions.            DESCRIPTION:  All focus area
proposed hardware MUST address packaging for high altitude airborne
applications at a minimum and supporting interceptor applications will
be considered a plus. This requires specific emphasis on size, weight
and power (SWaP) for proposed electronics.         The environmental
parameters that should be addressed for any hardware proposed include:
High altitude airborne operations in near vacuum conditions (optional
traceability to space operations in vacuum a plus); components should
have a shelf life of at least 5 years to accommodate payload integration
 and a service life of a minimum of 5 years. The components have to
operate in a radiation environment. For high altitude airborne
applications, the offerors should address proton and gamma radiation
with a minimum total dose of 10 kRad with special emphasis placed on
single event upset (SEU) and single event latch-up (SEL). Demonstrating a
 path to 100-300 kRad hardness is a plus. The operating temperature
range drives concept and capabilities with -54 degrees C to 40 degrees C
 desired to cover several requirements. For long term survival
temperature range -60 to 71 degrees C is desired.          PHASE I:
Develop a preliminary design for the proposed algorithms and electronics
 architecture or other ATP component. Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis
 (MS&amp;A) of the design must be presented to demonstrate the offeror
understands the physical principles, performance potential, scaling
laws, etc. MS&amp;A results must clearly demonstrate how near-term goals
 will be met, at a minimum. Proof of concept hardware development and
test is highly desirable. Proof of concept demonstration may be subscale
 or specific risk reduction activities associated with critical
components or technologies. Test results (if performed) should be used
in conjunction with MS&amp;A results to verify scaling laws and
feasibility. Phase I will include the development of plans to further
develop\/exploit this technology in Phase II. Offerors are strongly
encouraged to work with system and\/or payload contractors to help
ensure applicability of their efforts and begin work towards technology
transition. No specific contact information will be provided by the
topic authors.        PHASE II:  Complete critical design of prototype
component including all supporting MS&amp;A. Fabricate a prototype or
engineering demonstration unit (EDU) and perform characterization
testing within the financial and schedule constraints of the program to
show level of performance achieved compared to stated government goals.
In addition, environmental testing, especially radiation testing (if
required), is highly encouraged in this phase if selected components do
not have radiation performance data. The final report shall include
comparisons between MS&amp;A and test results, including identification
of performance differences or anomalies and reasons for the deviation
from MS&amp;A predictions. The contractor should keep in mind the goal
of commercialization of this innovation for the Phase III effort to
which end they should have working relationships with, and support from
system, spacecraft, and\/or payload contractors.         PHASE III:
Develop and execute a plan to market and manufacture the product
developed in Phase II. Assist the Missile Defense Agency in
transitioning this technology to the appropriate Ballistic Missile
Defense System (BMDS) prime contractor(s) for the engineering
integration and testing.         COMMERCIALIZATION:  The contractor will
 pursue commercialization of the various technologies developed in Phase
 II for potential commercial uses in such diverse fields as commercial
satellite imagery, optical (laser) communications, law enforcement,
rescue and recovery operations, maritime and aviation collision
avoidance sensors, medical uses and homeland defense applications.",

        "topic_name": "Development of Line-narrowed Diode Pump Sources
for DPAL systems",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop line-narrowed, frequency
stabilized diode pump sources to allow efficient resonant optical
pumping of alkali laser systems.         DESCRIPTION:  This topic
addresses diode technologies focused on enabling advanced closed cycle
flowing media laser systems that offer compact directed energy system
solutions for future ballistic missile defense applications.         A
promising example is the Diode Pumped Alkali Laser (DPAL). DPALs offer
the potential for high power and efficient operation by leveraging the
advantages of solid state and gas laser systems. These lasers are
produced by direct optical pumping of alkali atoms in the vapor phase.
The extremely low quantum defect of the alkali system minimizes thermal
loading and, like other gas lasers, the gain medium can be flowed to
reduce thermal management requirements. One key to producing efficient
systems is matching the absorption linewidth of the gain media to the
emission bandwidth of the diodes.     Absorption linewidths are
typically on the order of 0.01 nm to 0.1 nm while the diode emission is
typically on the order of a few nanometers. Previously, in order to
obtain sufficient overlap, a combination of pressure-broadening of the
gain medium and diode linewidth narrowing using external cavities was
used. The pressure-broadening can lead to detrimental effects in laser
performance, such as beam quality degradation. Additionally, the
diode-narrowing techniques are expensive and difficult to implement,
thus limiting their practical use.         A particular area of interest
 includes enabling technologies and support systems for the high-power
optical pumping of alkali vapor atoms. Semiconductor diode laser
technology presents the most cost-effective and scalable method to
obtain the high powers and narrow spectroscopic linewidths required for
these applications. Research and development is needed to realize
scalable narrow-linewidth wavelength-stabilized laser diode pump sources
 for DPAL applications. The availability of these high-power
spectroscopic pump sources would also find use in industrial and medical
 applications such as spin-exchange optical pumping (SEOP). With an
efficient optical pump source, diode-pumped alkali vapor lasers have the
 potential for scaling to extremely high-power levels for industrial and
 military applications. The main impediment to achieving these power
levels has been the availability of high-power narrow spectral
line-width laser diode pump sources. Traditional efforts to produce
narrow-line high-power diode laser pump sources typically rely on one of
 three methods, each with inherent tradeoffs and limitations.
Technologies that are presented should meet or exceed the following
requirements:             1) Diode emission bandwidth less than or equal
 to 0.05nm.         2) Center frequency locked to the D2 transition of
one of the alkalis of interest. Rubidium is of highest interest to MDA,
Cesium is the second highest, and Potassium is the third.         3) The
 long-term frequency drift cannot exceed 3GHz. The offeror should also
consider the time it takes for the system to turn on and stabilize, as
ultimately this will be required to be on the order of a few seconds.
      Technical approaches focused on or including 2D surface emitting
diode laser architectures are of specific interest.          PHASE I:
Demonstrate in Phase I through modeling, analysis, and
proof-of-principle experiments of critical elements of the proposed
technology that the proposed approach is viable for further
investigation in Phase II. Phase I work should clearly validate the
viability of the technology proposed to meet the operational environment
 for directed energy applications in a component critical performance
demonstration. Phase I should also result in a clear technology
development plan, schedule, transition risk assessment, and requirements
 document.     PHASE II:  The Phase II objective is to validate a
scalable and producible technology approach that MDA users and prime
contractors can transition in Phase III to their unique laser
application. Validate the feasibility of the proposed concept developed
in Phase I by development and demonstration of a key components
brassboard and the execution of supporting laboratory\/field experiments
 to demonstrate technology viability. Validation would include, but not
be limited to, system simulations, operation in test-beds, or operation
in a demonstration subsystem. The goal of the Phase II effort is to
demonstrate technology viability and the offeror should have working
relationships with system and payload contractors.     PHASE III:  In
this phase, the contractor will apply the innovations demonstrated in
the first two phases to one or more MDA element systems, subsystems, or
components. The objective of Phase III is to demonstrate the scalability
 of the developed technology, transition the component technology to the
 MDA system integrator or payload contractor, mature it for operational
insertion, and demonstrate the technology in an operational level
environment.     A partnership with a current or potential supplier of
MDA element systems, subsystems or components is highly desirable as is
interaction with OSD High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office programs.
         COMMERCIALIZATION:  High power laser components have numerous
commercial and other government agency applications in metal cutting,
material processing, welding, remote sensing (both terrestrial and
space), satellite communications, power beaming, and weather sensing.
Outside of MDA, numerous other DoD applications of the technology
include tracking, designation, directed energy, demilitarization of
munitions, and IED destruction.",

characteristics of an infrared scene depends on compensation for the
effects of water vapor in the medium between the sensor and the scene.
This SBIR deals specifically with the effects due to water vapor between
 an observation platform and its area of interest.  Infrared sensors
must look through the atmosphere where dynamic climate conditions
directly affect the target signature and apparent position as seen by
the sensor, through water vapor. Specifically: Model the effects of
water vapor on an infrared scene.  Leverage available weather databases
for humidity data. Develop tools that can mitigate these effects for a
simulated scene.         PHASE I:  Demonstrate the feasibility of
modeling atmospheric effects such as various water vapor types on
apparent position with high accuracy including all physics typically
neglected by physical optics techniques. Also, demonstrate the
feasibility of modeling star backgrounds for use in star calibration
functions with atmospheric conditions. For example, demonstrate the
feasibility of modeling the relationship between accuracy of these
models, and the error or uncertainty of a star calibration. Develop a
plan to mature the selected technique(s) in Phase II.         PHASE II:
 Implement the plan developed in Phase I and demonstrate the performance
 of the tool on models of interest to MDA. Characterize performance on
modern hardware and assess the accuracy of the code on realistic models.
        PHASE III:  Refine methodology and tool development and
transition to interested platforms.     COMMERCIALIZATION:
Commercialization: The contractor will pursue commercialization of the
various technologies developed in Phase II for potential commercial uses
 in such diverse fields as pilot training simulations, computer graphics
 hw\/sw applications, remote sensing, meteorology, and weather
prediction.",

 for Improved ISP of DACS Thrusters",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is
seeking innovative solutions for improving the specific impulse (ISP) of
 kill vehicle Divert and Attitude Control Thrusters (DACS) Thrusters.
This topic should focus on low-weight methods of extending or actuating
DACS size nozzles to increase expansion ratio with high reliability.
Discussions of alternative solutions are welcome.          DESCRIPTION:
 Future Missile Defense Weapon Systems will need to increase divert
capability (acceleration) to perform mission requirements.  Increased
mass flow out the nozzle by higher temperature propellant is limited by
the thermal limits of advanced materials.  ISP may also be increased by
increasing the velocity of the propellant exiting the nozzle.
DACS systems typically are carried in the nosecone of a missile
interceptor and the volume available to store the DACS thrusters is
limited.  The typical thruster will have a minimum length bell nozzle
with the expansion ratio limited by the length available to store the
nozzle.  Considerable work has been completed in the past on mechanical
nozzle extensions to increase the expansion area and several expandable
nozzle designs are currently in use but they are typically heavy and
used for small increases in exit velocity.  DACS thrusters are used in
an exo-atmosphere near vacuum environment and can potentially be
expanded much further than expandable nozzles designed for use in the
atmosphere.        Weight is critical for DACS thrusters and any nozzle
extension system must be low weight.  The extension system must also be
highly reliable.  If the nozzle extension fails to actuate correctly,
the effective thrust from the thruster will be greatly reduced and the
DACS will become severely imbalanced.        The MDA is seeking thrust
levels that range between 100  350 lbf with nozzle expansion ratios
greater than 24 that can operate at a minimum of 1 minute while
operating on a gas generator at 5500F.        Solutions utilizing divert
 change control systems other than DACS thrusters are welcome.
PHASE I:  During the Phase I contract, The proposer shall conduct a
design study that shows the feasibility of the concept including
numerical simulation of the proposed approach.  They proposer shall
trade the additional mass added to the system against the system
performance and compare to traditional nozzles of equivalent properties.
  The proposer shall provide estimated performance and reliability
characteristics.        PHASE II:  If selected for a Phase II, the
proposer shall fabricate the nozzle concept for testing.  Testing should
 include multiple initial tests that demonstrate the deployment of the
concept.  Phase II should conclude with hot fire testing of the concept
in a vacuum. The proposer shall provide performance and reliability

support from a MDA Prime or Propulsion vendor. The proposer shall
continue testing and development with a MDA Prime or Propulsion vendor

storage capabilities of a solid rocket motor (SRM) system while having
the thrust control and flexibility of a liquid system.  Material
handling of a fine powder from a storage tank to one of several
combustion chambers under acceleration, rotation, and microgravity

 of motors.          The Divert and Attitude Control System (DACS) is a
combination of multiple nozzles and valves to either deliver liquid fuel

to maneuver in space.  By powdering the SRM fuel, it may be possible to
enable the SRM system to closely mirror the benefits of the liquid
system.          The system may use a compressed gas such as O2 or
liquid to carry the fuel particles and aid in combustion or a mechanical

        "topic_name": "Marking of Components for Avoidance of
Counterfeit Parts",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate capability
for guaranteeing authenticity of critical electronic components in MDA
hardware.  Ensure that physical marking techniques are sufficiently
robust to withstand handling through supply chain intermediaries and
program installation and maintenance processes.  Demonstrate confidence
in the marking process as a viable, affordable, reliable method of
increasing confidence in the authenticity of DoD and MDA electronic
components.        DESCRIPTION:  MDA uses thousands of different
electronic components in their mission and safety critical hardware.
This includes systems such as missile guidance control, attitude
control, radars, communications, systems abort, and telemetry systems.
These systems rely on hundreds of defense contractors to design,
purchase components for, and assemble the components into the BMDS"s
mission and safety critical systems.  Reliable estimates indicate that
more than 10% of the electronic components currently in these systems
are obsolete.  This means it is likely there are from 1,000 to 10,000
electronic components in MDA systems that are no longer available from
the original manufacturer or an authorized supplier for the
manufacturer.  Virtually all other DoD agencies are facing a similar
scenario.  Counterfeiting is estimated to have increased from 13% to 22%
 annually in the past several years.  A NAVAIR researcher estimated 15%
of all spare and replacement integrated circuits purchased by DoD are
counterfeit.  In a 2.5 year span from 2007 to 2010, Customs and Border
Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) seized
over 5.6 million counterfeit semiconductor devices.        When
electronic components are obsolete, they must usually be located from
unauthorized suppliers.  These suppliers search for parts from their own
 stock, contractor or government excess stock, and often from internet
listing sites which list available components.  Components from all
locations, and in particular from internet listing sites, are at high
risk for being counterfeited.  Used, scrapped semiconductor electronic
components are removed from circuit boards in a fashion that often
subjects the parts to both thermal and electrostatic stresses beyond the
 manufacturer"s recommended limits.  In addition, generic components of
this type (e.g., memory devices, amplifiers, voltage regulators) which
have many versions from multiple manufacturers, may be remarked to
falsely identify the parts as having greater than actual capability
(e.g., capacity, speed, power dissipation, temperature range) for the
part.  This risk is present for all purchases from unauthorized
suppliers, regardless of the obsolescence status.  However, the risk for
 active parts is more easily mitigated through maximum use of authorized
 suppliers.        Most counterfeit electronic components are subjected
to some level of remarking.  This is done because new electronic
components are generally packaged with all the parts in one shipment
produced from a small number (two or less) of production batches.  These
 batches are usually identified through a lot or date code designator on
 the top and\/or bottom of the part which can be used to identify the
approximate timeframe, and often facility, for the production of the
component.  Counterfeiters remark product, even if it is the correct
part number, in order to make the entire shipment appear as if it was
from one lot or date code.        There are currently three primary ways
 in which counterfeit parts are remarked.  All of them involve some sort
 of abrasive method of removing the old ink markings.  The most common
method is to use sandpaper to remove the markings.  The resultant
directional scratches are then covered up by recoating with a liquid
that cures to a color and texture similar to the original part.  This
method is usually fairly easy to detect with visual inspection and
solvent application, but the remarking quality is improving.  The second
 method is to use sandblasting equipment to gently remove the ink
markings.  The third method is to use mechanical lapping techniques to
polish the surface.  Since recoating the surface is not required, the
last two methods are currently very difficult to detect, potentially
requiring the use of a scanning electron microscope in order to detect
leftover sanding particles or a different surface texture.        This
topic solicits innovative methods of placing markings or coatings onto
authentic parts at the time of manufacture, to enable customers at later
 stages in the supply chain to confirm that the component surfaces have
not been tampered with.  The four most critical requirements for this
counterfeit component avoidance technique are:        1. The
marking\/coating must be virtually impossible for a counterfeiter to
copy.      2. The marking\/coating must withstand normal component
handling and usage without significant deterioration.        3. The
marking\/coating process must not be cost-prohibitive.       4. The
marking\/coating verification process must not be cost or time
prohibitive.        One method currently being investigated is the
application of organic materials, specifically deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA), to component surfaces.  Application of a unique mark to the
component surface would provide a nearly guaranteed method of ensuring
the component surfaces have not been tampered with.  Components could
still be refurbished and resold as new parts, but the markings,
including lot and date code, would have to remain unchanged.  While
marking or coating components does not solve the current issue with
obsolete parts, it would proactively address the counterfeiting of
currently active parts which may become unavailable from authorized
suppliers in the future.  Development of a functional system may
encourage widespread acceptance in DoD and commercial systems.
Development and test must be performed with the goal of meeting the four
 critical requirements above.  Phase I development work should focus on
meeting the first two critical requirements (difficult to copy,
withstand normal use).  Phase II should address the third critical
requirement (cost-effective), plus investigate potential applications
beyond electronic components.  The third Phase should address the fourth
 critical component (simple fast detection).          PHASE I:  Develop a
 method for placing a unique mark onto components.  Ensure there are at
least 10,000 different formulations available to identify different
components, and potentially different manufacturing dates.  Demonstrate
the method for placing it onto a component in a manner that cannot be
readily copied.  Demonstrate the current detection methods are 100%
accurate in differentiating legally coated\/marked components from
illegally (lower technology) coated\/marked components, or
uncoated\/unmarked components.  Demonstrate that the markings\/coatings
are compliant to MIL-STD-883H Test Method No. 2015 Resistance to
Solvents after 1) physical handling, 2) temperature excursions from -65C
 to 300C for short periods (one minute), and -55C to 150C for extended
periods (500 hours).  Prove that modification of the surface by any of
the three counterfeiting methods of remarking described above will
guarantee detection as a remarked component.  Acceptable detection
methods at this level may include sending samples to the developer"s
facility for analysis.  Test plan must be submitted and approved by MDA.
        PHASE II:  Develop production-level methods that allow
cost-effective placement of the unique marking onto components.  Verify
production capability to support marking formulation and supplies to
multiple companies (100 minimum).  Estimate minimum amount of unique
marking material per component to achieve 100% confidence.  Generate a
cost model for the implementation.  At this point the contractor or MDA
would solicit DoD, contractor, and component manufacturer endorsement of
 the effort.  The Phase II cost estimates would be assessed in order to
determine feasibility.       PHASE III:  Develop a plan to establish
in-house detectability methods for electronic components that are 100%
accurate in detecting remarked product.  Determine implementation
timeframe, and develop a cost estimate and time estimate for using
equipment available for purchase to be used within the purchasing
facility to determine whether components have been recoated.  This
in-house assessment capability must be stand-alone, but may include
exchange of data with the developer in order to confirm encoded DNA
information is accurate.  MDA and developer present final information to
 DoD to develop plan forward for adoption (e.g., no adoption, adoption
for only critical semiconductor components, full adoption).
COMMERCIALIZATION:  The developer will pursue commercialization of the
various technologies and processes developed in prior Phases potential
commercial uses in electronic components, and assess potential for
marking mechanical parts or materials, labels, and other items
determined to be at high risk for counterfeiting.",

Insulators",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate methods for
thermally isolating a nozzle exit cone from its housing and the
associated bondline joint.          DESCRIPTION:  One of the limitations
 of a rocket motor nozzle is the heat transfer from the exit cone to the
 housing and bondline joint during firing and heat soak.  This is
especially true of a dual pulse rocket motor with an inter-pulse delay
(IPD) that allows for additional heat soak between firings.  Isolation
of the exit cone retains the bondline joint integrity and reduces the
temperature of adjacent components, such as, a flex bearing.  For a dual
 pulse motor, this would allow for a longer IPD with greater flexibility
 in mission profiles due to added thermal protection and exit cone
retention strength.          An innovation in applying thermal barrier
coatings to phenolic nozzle components, such as, Carbon Cloth Phenolic
(CCP) would reduce the heat transfer during and after operation of a
rocket motor using a phenolic nozzle exit cone.   The innovation should
be both durable and lightweight while lowering the heat transfer into
the bondline to maintain strength, and also reduce the heat transfer
into the nozzle housing.  The innovation should be compatible with
traditional nozzle materials and adhesives while increasing performance
over current state-of-the-art.            PHASE I:  Develop a proof of

 National Science Foundation (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) program seeks state-of-the-art, high-risk, high-potential
innovation research proposals in the area of Electronics, Information
and Communication Technologies. These proposals should seek to provide
economic and technological benefits that will motivate their successful
adoption in the commercial
marketplace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe NSF SBIR Program
conceptualizes Electronics, Information and Communication Technologies
in the form of a five-layer stack. Each layer of the stack builds upon
the layer(s) below and supports the layer(s) above. At the foundation of
 this stack are devices. Devices (ED) are the building blocks for
Components (EC) that are assembled into Systems (ES) built for
Applications (IA) that are employed to deliver Services (IS).
Innovations across the stack can range widely, and hardware as well as
software innovations will be supported. Considering the two ends of the
stack, device innovations will typically employ unique physical
phenomena for their competitive advantage and be embodied in hardware,
whereas innovations in services will typically be more architectural in
nature and be embodied in
software.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProposals must address
one of the subtopics that are outlined below. Proposals that are not
responsive to the subtopics outlined below will be returned without
review. When submitting a proposal to the EI Topic, code the proposal to
 the corresponding subtopic under which you are submitting the proposal,
 e.g., ES5 for proposals in the area of &amp;quot;Robotics&amp;quot;. In
 addition, use the same code as the first item in the key words\/phrases
 portion of the Project Summary of your proposal.

for-profit and non-profit, must respond to customer needs, manage
internal activities, and adapt to competitive market pressures much more
 rapidly than at any other period in human history. Enterprises that
effectively and efficiently combine computing, communication, services
and business process advances become leaders in their respective
markets. These developments have created significant commercial

        "topic_name": "Advanced Tools and Technologies for Cerebrospinal
 Fluid Shunts SBIR ",
        "description": "\n\tHydrocephalus is caused by a heterogeneous
group of diseases and disorders that can affect individuals of any age,
from infants to the elderly. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts have been
successfully used to treat hydrocephalus for over 50 years and are the
most common treatment option for this disorder. In a typical shunt
system, a catheter is used to drain the fluid from the brain to a site
in the body where it can be absorbed, such as a chamber of the heart or
the peritoneal cavity. Flow rate and direction are regulated by a valve.
 \n\n\tWhile CSF shunts are a clinically proven technology that have
enhanced the quality of life for many individuals, shunt obstruction and
 malfunction continue to be an issue affecting a significant portion of
the treated population. A NIH-sponsored workshop on Hydrocephalus held
in 2005
(http:\/\/www.ninds.nih.gov\/news_and_events\/proceedings\/Hydrocephalus_2005.htm)
 identified the challenges and opportunities associated with
hydrocephalus research that could eventually lead to improvement in
patient outcomes. As noted at the meeting, hydrocephalus treatment has
not changed significantly since the creation of the CSF shunt. Although
adjustable valves have improved the outcomes for some individuals,
overdrainage and suboptimal shunt operation still occurs in many
patients. Shunt obstruction and malfunction are the most common causes
of shunt failure and occur in approximately one third of pediatric
patients in the first year. Obstruction often occurs at the ventricular
catheter tip and the shunt valve. Mechanical failure includes fracture
of the tubing, disconnection of components, and shunt migration. In
preterm newborn infants, shunts are placed to relieve post-hemorrhagic
hydrocephalus and, due to the higher than normal CSF protein contents,
shunt malfunction and obstruction occurs secondary to protein
coagulation around the shunt tip. \n\n\tMany children with CSF shunt
systems have additional surgeries to modify or replace the CSF shunt
device during their lifetimes because of these issues. Infection occurs
in 8-10% of cases and is also a significant concern because of increased
 morbidity, high re-infection rates, and other severe complications.
Overdrainage with consequent collapse of the ventricles can also cause
serious neurologic dysfunction. In the elderly, the treatment of normal
pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) by ventricular shunts can result in major
neurologic improvement. However, as the ventricles decrease in size and
the atrophic brain collapses away from the dura, bridging veins may
rupture. Consequently subdural hematoma formation is a common, major
serious adverse event in such patients that leads to significant loss of
 quality of life. Diagnosis of CSF shunt failure or suboptimal shunt
operation can be difficult. Smptoms of CSF shunt failure usually affect
cognition (abulia), gait and continence. These changes may be
particularly difficult to ascribe to a specific cause in the elderly.
Although imaging and pressure sensors exist, many outcomes are
qualitative in nature and may require baseline information about the
patient. Current diagnostics and assessment results may depend on the
type of failure, the system type, and patient age. In addition,
real-time diagnostic tools for the outpatient or home setting do not
exist. New innovations that incorporate the tremendous activities in
material science, micromechanical systems, biomaterials, nanotechnology
and other new bioengineering innovations could improve treatment of
hydrocephalus. The ideal system would include a feedback design to
regulate the ventricular pressure and\/or volume.\n\n\tSyringomyelia,
formation of an expanding syrinx (fluid-filled cyst) within the spinal
cord due to obstruction of normal CSF flow, is related to hydrocephalus
or spinal cord injury. Syringoperitoneal shunts to drain the syrinx are
widely used, and subject to the same blockage, infection and other
complications noted above.\n\n\tThe purpose of this initiative is to
stimulate the development of: 1) Monitoring and diagnostic tools for
determining and\/or controlling CSF shunt function and 2) improving CSF
shunt design and materials to decrease shunt failure rates. The tools
and technologies developed under this program will improve shunt design,
 and the diagnosis of shunt failure, leading to an improvement in the
quality of life for hydrocephalus patients with CSF shunts. Diagnostic
and assessment technologies developed through this initiative would
improve monitoring and diagnosis of shunt failure in both the home and
the clinic, allowing patients to identify issues before significant
side-effects occur. Also included are technologies that will improve
patient outcomes by reducing the CSF shunt failure rates and improving
shunt operation. Different hydrocephalus patient groups may also have
different needs, for example younger patients need systems that take
into consideration patient growth and require devices with long
lifetimes. Projects with the potential for near term clinical impact are
 strongly encouraged, but exciting and novel longer-term proposals are
permissible. Diagnostic tools for hydrocephalus to determine if shunt
treatment is necessary and diagnosis methods for general CSF infection
are not appropriate for this initiative.\n\n\tThe following research
topics would be appropriate for Phase I or Phase II projects under this
initiative. This list is not meant to be all-inclusive:\n\n\tInnovative
CSF Shunts:\n\n\t\n\t\tShunt components that reduce obstruction at the
ventricular catheter tip and\/or shunt valve \n\t\tShunt systems that
decrease the risk of overdrainage, particularly in pediatric populations
 or the elderly who are at risk for secondary subdural hematoma.

operation\n\t\n\t\tShunt systems that minimize or eliminate bacterial
biofilm and thrombus formation.\n\t\n\t\tShunt systems that are

fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), bioluminescence resonance
 energy transfer (BRET), flow cytometry, and cell based imaging. In
general, assays proposed for development should be easy to execute (for

enhance integrative cancer biology research. This FOA encourages Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant applications from small
business concerns (SBCs) that address this
goal.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tIntegrative cancer biology focuses on the
analysis of cancer as a complex biological system, uniting experimental
and computational approaches to understanding cancer by leveraging
existing high-throughput data, generating specific quantitative
supplemental data, and creating new software tools and computational
methods necessary to construct and validate predictive in silico models
of cancer processes. Central to the integrative cancer biology approach
is the construction and validation of sophisticated predictive
computational models of cancer processes. These models require the input
 and integration of large quantities of heterogeneous data ranging from
molecular\/cellular data to clinical information.\n\n\tLarge amounts of
molecular data are generated through a variety of endeavors and the data
 handling software and computational modeling methods for utilizing
these data sets are under development. However, significant gaps remain
in our ability to effectively model and understand complex cancer

the development of new technologies or improvements to existing
technologies for the isolation and characterization of proteins,
peptides, or micro RNAs that normally exist in complex biologically
relevant mixtures at concentrations beyond the lower limits of current
technologies (e.g., low abundance proteins present in &amp;lt;5000
copies per cell). \n\n\tBackground\n\n\tThere have been significant
improvements in technologies that enable the isolation, quantification,
and characterization of the cancer-relevant biomolecules in complex
mixtures. These technologies show potential as both basic research and
diagnostic tools and are relevant to a number of cancer types,
including, for example, those of the breast, lung, and brain. Existing
technologies tend to be robust in case of the separation and
characterization of the major components of biological mixtures.
However, the low abundance components are often lost in the process
and\/or are not analyzed. Numerous findings indicate that the low
abundance components of complex mixtures can provide important
information about the status of a cell. Small concentration changes
and\/or altered modification patterns of disease-relevant low abundance
components have the potential to serve as indicators of the onset,
stage, and response to therapy of cancer, provided appropriate robust
technologies are developed. Thus, detailed information on the levels of
low abundance biomolecules and their modification patterns (as well as
on the variability of these parameters) in normal and abnormal
(neoplastic) cells is needed for better understanding of cancer cell
biology.\n\n\tIn addition to cancer-relevant projects, technologies that

expected to ultimately facilitate research on the roles of specific low

        "topic_name": "Development of In-Vitro Assays to Assess the
Potency of Botulinum Neurotoxin Type A",
        "description": "\n\tClostridium botulinum is an anaerobic
bacterium that produces a neurotoxin thought to be the most lethal
substance known (on a per molecule or per weight basis). Strains of C.
botulinum have been identified that produce 7 different types of this
neurotoxin, designated as types A through G. The toxin is synthesized as
 a single polypeptide of approximately 150 kD. Selective proteolysis is
important in achieving the fully active toxin molecule consisting of two
 chains, designated as the heavy and light chains. The toxins are zinc
metalloproteases that bind at specific receptor sites on cholinergic
presynaptic terminals. The heavy chain is required for binding and entry
 into the neurons through interaction with the SNARE complex, and the
light chain is required to prevent neurotransmitter release by cleaving
synaptic terminal proteins (types A and E on SNAP-25; types B, D, F, and
 G on synaptobrevin; and type C on syntaxin). The botulinum toxin
effectively produces a state of functional denervation through the
failure of synaptic transmission at neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) by
inhibiting release of acetylcholine neurotransmitter which is
responsible for activation of muscle contraction. Eventually new nerve
terminals are formed and this sprouting and formation of new NMJ is
responsible for the recovery of muscle function and the consequent loss
of effectiveness of the toxin over subsequent months. \n\n\tTherapeutic
applications of botulinum toxin have increased steadily over the years
since the initial FDA approval in 1989 for its use in the treatment of
strabismus and blepharospasm. Type A neurotoxin is presently in
widespread clinical use although other serotypes are under investigation
 by various manufacturers, and one type B neurotoxin product is on the
market. In addition to cosmetic indications, BoNT\/A is employed
effectively for the treatment of movement disorders and spasticity,
particularly for focal dystonia, the most frequent occurring types of
which include cervical dystonia or torticollis, blepharospasm, writers
cramp, musicians dystonia, oromandibular dystonia, hemifacial spasm,
occupational dystonia, and laryngeal dystonia.\n\n\tThe potency of
botulinum toxins is currently being assessed with a mouse
intraperitoneal injection assay which measures activity in Mouse Units
(MU), with 1 MU of activity defined as the LD50 dose (death within 72 to
 96 hours in 50% of the mice). However the LD50 assay does not allow for
 standardization of potency units for products made by different
manufacturers because of the inherent variability in conducting the
assay and species differences in sensitivity to the various toxins. This
 poses problems in product use and has potential safety consequences
which are magnified as new products enter the market. Dramatic
differences in the apparent potency confound clinical dose finding and
could potentially result in over or under dosing of patients.\n\n\tThis
Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) seeks applications that will
develop cell-based or other alternative approaches to the current mouse
LD50 assay that will reliably assess the potency of BoNT\/A products.
The proposed assay must be able to accurately quantify nanogram levels
of active toxin in the finished product, which may contain a high
concentration of bulking or stabilizing proteins. In addition, the
approach must provide high sensitivity, with a limit of detection that
resembles or exceeds that of the mouse LD50 assay. If both functions of
the neurotoxin cannot be measured in a single assay, then the
development of more than one assay is acceptable. The proposal should
include development of a reference standard. Assays should have the
following minimal characteristics:\n\n\t\n\t\tAccurate determination of
BoNT\/A potency in the therapeutic dose range used in
humans\n\t\n\t\tSuitability for routine commercial release testing of
BoNT\/A therapeutics. For guidance on some of the requirements for
commercial suitability, please see International Conference on
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Guidelines Q2(R1) Validation of Analytical
 Procedures: Text and Methodology.
