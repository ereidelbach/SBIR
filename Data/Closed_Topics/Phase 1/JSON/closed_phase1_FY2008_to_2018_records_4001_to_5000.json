        "description": "\n\tSeveral U.S. government sponsored programs,
including the U.S. Tox21 program (http:\/\/ntp.niehs.nih.gov\/go\/tox21)
 and the U.S. EPA&amp;rsquo;s ToxCast program
(http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/ncct\/toxcast\/), were developed to expand the
scope and throughput of screening compounds for toxicity. A primary
focus of these programs is on the use of in vitro methods and assays
using lower organisms to screen thousands of chemicals for toxicity in
order to identify mechanisms of compound-induced biological activity,
characterize toxicity pathways, facilitate cross-species extrapolation,
and provide input to models for low-dose extrapolation. Data generated
by these methods will be used to prioritize compounds for more extensive
 toxicological evaluation and to develop predictive models for
biological response in humans. Current approaches are limited in terms
of incorporating genetic variability in toxicity testing and in
assessing the effects of chemicals in multiple normal tissue and cell
types, relying on immortalized cell lines or primary cell lines derived
from tissues. Thus, there is a need for novel, medium- to
high-throughput assays (at least a 96-well format) to evaluate the
effects of chemical compounds on the differentiation of pluripotent or
multi-potent stem cells as well as the effects of chemical exposures on
differentiated cell types representative of various in vivo tissues.
Approaches can include the use of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS)
cells, approved human embryonic stem (ES) cell lines, or ES or iPS cells
 derived from genetically characterized mouse strains. Assays should be
able to measure the effects of toxicants on the differentiation process
and\/or on the differentiated cells themselves; cell types of high
priority include but are not limited to cardiomyocytes, neural cells,
hepatocytes, endothelial cells, lung (airway or alveolar) cells, and
hormonally-responsive tissues such as reproductive tissues or breast
epithelial cells.\n\n\tApproaches can include:\n\n\t\n\t\tAssays that
evaluate the ability of chemicals to alter the ability of ES\/iPS cells
to be differentiated into various cell types\n\t\n\t\tHuman iPS or mouse
 ES\/iPS cell line panels to incorporate genetic variation into toxicity
 screening.\n\t\n\t\tEngineered stem cell lines to simulate the common
genetic variants in human disease that would predispose to increased
sensitivity to toxicants (e.g., Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s Disease, autism,
breast cancer, or other relevant disease models)\n\t\n\t\tHigh-content
screening or &amp;lsquo;omics-based assays (metabolomics, proteomics,
epigenetic marks, or transcriptomics) for toxicant-induced effects using
 differentiated cell types derived from pluripotent or multi-potent
cells.\n\n\n\tAssays should be developed using toxicants or reference
compounds that are appropriate to the endpoints and purposes of that
assay. High priority should be given to including some compounds that
are currently in the Tox21 10k library (see
http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/ncct\/dsstox\/sdf_tox21s.html). The Tox 21 library
 contains samples from commercial sources and includes industrial
chemicals, pesticides, food additives, toxicity reference chemicals, and
 drug compounds.\n\n\tApplications may develop assays using mouse
embryonic stem cells, adult human stem cells, induced pluripotent stem
(iPS) cells, or human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines that are approved
 for NIH funding as indicated in the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell
Registry (http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/stem_cells\/registry\/current.htm).
If an hESC application proposes research for which the specified hESC
line(s) has not yet been approved, only restricted awards will be issued
 until the specified hESC line(s) is approved.\n\n\tFor this FOA, assays
 should be developed using only human ES, iPS or adult stem cells or
ES\/iPS cells from genetically-characterized mouse strains. Applications
 proposing assay development using cells derived from rat strains or
other animal models are not responsive to this FOA. &amp;nbsp;\n",

        "description": "\n\tPurpose\n\n\tThe objective of this Funding
Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to support the development of
microfluidic devices to evaluate blood of pediatric\/neonatal
patients.&amp;nbsp; Devices designed to analyze thrombotic, transfusion,
 and\/or hemostatic conditions of blood are of interest.&amp;nbsp; Many
clinical laboratory-based testing procedures require relatively large
volumes of blood for analysis. Excessive blood draws can result in
anemia and require corrective transfusions in critically ill
pediatric\/neonatal patients. As a result, these critical blood
evaluations may not be performed, or are performed infrequently in
pediatric\/neonatal patients due to the risk of depleting their limited
blood volumes.&amp;nbsp; Microfluidic devices which analyze microliter
or nanoliter quantities of blood could represent a significant means of
achieving blood conservation in pediatric intensive care
populations.\n\n\tIn this FOA, the NHLBI will support the development of
 microfluidic devices capable of analyzing minute quantities of blood
for a variety of cellular and protein biomarkers for thrombotic,
transfusion, and\/or hemostatic conditions. The proposed devices should
be automated, rapid, user friendly, and not require highly trained
individuals to perform these tests. All microfluidic design options are
acceptable (ie. digital or microchannel), with ideal designs being
portable, sensitive, and having commercial potential. Multifunctional
microfluidic platform designs that make the most efficient use of blood
samples are encouraged. &amp;nbsp;This FOA seeks applications that
expand the potential of microfluidic devices to perform blood analysis
in both clinical and research settings.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tRecent
advances in microfluidic technology (ie. lab-on-a-chip) have
demonstrated significant potential to perform a wide variety of
analytical procedures.&amp;nbsp; Assays developed for the microfluidic
platform have included immunofluorescence, DNA\/RNA techniques,
proteomics, mass spectrometry, and cell sorting, among others. The
capability of microfluidic devices to analyze small volumes of whole
blood or sera makes this technology ideally suited to a variety of
clinical applications, particularly those involving pediatric\/neonatal
subjects for whom sample size and sampling frequency must necessarily be
 limited. In an attempt to reduce phlebotomy-related blood loss, devices
 that analyze sample sizes of approximately 100 microliters or less are
preferred. Also, by utilizing small volumes of samples and reagents,
microfluidic devices offer the potential for reduced cost and shortened
assay run times, when compared with standard laboratory-based
testing.&amp;nbsp; In the clinical setting, rapid turnaround times for
blood analysis could have an added advantage of leading to faster
diagnosis and treatment times.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tComplex changes of blood
system physiology occur rapidly in sick children and newborns. Within
the blood system, changes in cellular and protein components play
critical roles in hemostasis and wound healing. For example, adequate
platelet concentrations are essential for proper hemostatic functions.
Patients with abnormally low levels of platelets run serious risks of
internal hemorrhage. Also, imbalances in the levels of clotting factors
can quickly place patients at risk for hemorrhage, thrombosis, or
stroke. Consequently, pediatric and neonatal patients require frequent
monitoring of their blood for change in status of hemostatic and\/or
thrombotic conditions due to receiving various treatment
regimens.&amp;nbsp; This is particularly true for individuals following
platelet or RBC transfusions. Of the 250,000 admissions to pediatric
intensive care units each year, approximately half will require at least
 one RBC transfusion. Additionally, many also receive IV fluids which
may alter the hemostasis\/thrombosis equilibrium. Monitoring the effects
 of these treatments can be particularly challenging in patients with
small body mass and low body blood volumes.&amp;nbsp; With limited blood
 sample sizes, microfluidic devices could serve an important role in
providing a more efficient way to monitor blood values in these
patients.\n\n\tIn addition to the clinical applications, microfluidic
devices could also provide an opportunity for pediatric\/neonatal
patients to participate in drug research and development studies.
Historically there has been a lack of testing of new drug candidates in
pediatric populations in the U.S., resulting in a lag of FDA-approved
therapies for these patients. The current lack of body-size appropriate
blood testing procedures represents one hurdle that prevents pediatric
participation in numerous clinical and research studies.&amp;nbsp;
Testing in pediatric patients serves another critical role, since
children differ from adults in both physiology and pharmacologic
response to drug therapies.&amp;nbsp; Microfluidic technology offers the
 potential of greater pediatric participation in clinical trials and
subsequently improved drug safety and efficacy for these subjects. As an
 example, microfluidic devices could facilitate pharmacokinetic analysis
 of new drugs in pediatric\/neonatal populations which could potentially
 improve the availability of these new agents for pediatric
use.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tMicrofluidic devices could also be particularly
useful in research studies of thrombosis, hemostasis, or transfusion
medicine in pediatric subjects. Devices with capabilities for studying
anti-thrombotic therapies or congenital and acquired bleeding disorders,
 would be of interest. As an example, microfluidic devices have been
shown to be particularly useful for studying cellular functions such as
platelet adhesion and platelet activation. Devices capable of analyzing
blood clotting mechanisms, anti-clotting mechanisms, hemorrhage or
anticoagulation therapy monitoring could be applied to these important
areas of clinical research. Studies of optimal transfusion practices,
cell sorting capabilities to measure cellular levels in blood samples,
or levels of platelet activation would be of interest
also.\n\n\tMicrofluidic Design Characteristics of

solicits Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant applications
from small business concerns (SBCs) to propose research to support
research to develop 3D printers, polymers, and process specifications to
 produce premature- and neonatal-specific devices for external use or
short-term insertion and implantation into the human body. There is
currently an unmet need for infant-specific medical devices. Within the
current manufacturing paradigm, it is challenging to produce small
quantities of devices in the breadth of sizes and anatomies required for
 infants. This is especially true for minimally
invasive\/non-implantable flexible medical devices like various tubes,
catheters, and even masks. To meet this need in a commercially viable
manner, manufacturers need a way to quickly make these devices in the
right size and configuration for a small number of patients.\n\n\t3D
printing, a form of additive manufacturing, may potentially provide a
solution to meet this need. 3D printing builds parts layer-by-layer from
 a digital model from metals, plastics, or even ceramics. This process
allows for complex components and devices matched to a
patient&amp;rsquo;s anatomy. Most importantly, because 3D printing does
not require specialized cutting tools or molds, design changes can be
made very rapidly and applied to only a small number of units. The
number and type of substances that can be used as raw material for a
printer are large and expanding. However, a polymer\/printer system has
not yet been developed that can make the medical devices with the
necessary properties to meet the stated need.\n\n\tAs part of the FDA
review process for medical devices, a manufacturer must show that their
device meets an appropriate level of biocompatibility, mechanical
properties, and functionalities (e.g. sterilizability) for the intended
use. To date, no polymer system has been shown to have the necessary
biocompatibility properties, pliability, and ability to be 3D printed to
 meet the needs of infant devices.\n\n\tThis FOA is intended to support
cutting-edge research, conducted by small business entities, which would
 lead to the development of 3-D printing system that can produce plastic
 devices for clinical use with infants. While the material and printer
must work in tandem, the goal is not to create a completely new printing
 technology but rather develop a material and printer combination that
can produce the pliable medical devices that can meet or exceed the
expectations applied to comparable devices through FDA Guidance and
international consensus standards. While there are many non-permanently
implantable devices for infants, this FOA is restricted
to:\n\n\t\n\t\tDevices that contact skin, but are external, e.g. face
masks for delivering oxygen\n\t\n\t\tDevices for short term insertion
into body orifices, which would make contact with mucosal surfaces, e.g.
 gastric feeding tubes\n\t\n\t\tDevices for short term implantation into
 tissues, e.g. drainage tubes and peritoneal dialysis
catheters\n\n\n\tThe work to be supported by this FOA requires two
elements:\n\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of a printable polymer or polymer and
printer system that can be used to make one or more infant devices in
the desired application areas.\n\t\n\t\tThe final printed device would
be tested to have the biocompatibility, irritability, mechanical, and
functional performance that would be used to support a device submission
 to the FDA.\n\n\n\tPrior to submitting an application, applicants are
encouraged to review FDA guidance documents

Nondestructive Fast Neutron Analysis in the Context of International
Safeguards.DNN R&amp;amp;D has a need for robust instruments to provide
nondestructive fast neutron analysis of safeguard relevant materials.
These materials will have high gamma-ray emission, so the measurement
system must be capable of efficient gamma-ray rejection. Such
instruments are needed to detect partial defect analysis (missing pins)
on spent fuel assemblies and materials accounting using neutron
coincidence analysis of fissile materials.Questions \u2013 Contact:

of the Advanced Air Vehicles program are safety and efficiency, which
can be achieved simultaneously through designer materials tailored for
future aircraft structures. The SOA for lightweight structures are
carbon fiber reinforced polymeric composites which make up approximately
 50% of the weight of Boeing's 787. Adoption of all-carbon nanotube
(CNT) composites to exploit their potential for enhancing structural
efficiency is viewed as too far term, given the current state of CNT
technology maturation. A more attainable approach is to take advantage
of the multifunctionality offered by CNTs through the use of hybrid
composites where CNTs are integrated into conventional carbon fiber
reinforced composite structures. Hybrid composites enable improved
mechanical properties such as interlaminar strength, while
simultaneously increasing electrical and thermal conductivity to enable
features such as lightning strike protection, embedded sensing, etc. The
 targeted outcome is reduced weight and enhanced safety performance for
future hybrid composite aircraft structures. For this subtopic, the plan
 is to start phase 1 with a systems analysis approach to identify the
benefits and target areas for hybrid composite utility and to provide
some direction and benefit analysis for applying hybrid composites in
aircraft structures. Then the intention of the Phase II would be to
tailor, build and test the materials to demonstrate the property

        "topic_name": "Aerodynamic Efficiency Drag Reduction
Technology",
        "description": "Lead Center:LaRC\u00a0The challenge of
energy-efficient flight has at its foundation aerodynamic efficiency,
and at the foundation of aerodynamic efficiency is low drag. Drag can be
 broadly decomposed into four components: viscous or skin friction drag,
 lift-induced drag, wave or compressibility drag, and excrescence drag
due to various protruding items such as antennae, wipers, lights, etc.
The relative impact of these four forces depends upon the targeted
flight regime and vehicle-specific design requirements. The first force,
 however, viscous skin friction, stands out as particularly significant
across most classes of flight vehicles and effective measures for its
control would have a major impact of flight efficiency. In particular,
supersonic, low-boom flight and new generations of energy-efficient
subsonic transport airplanes including high L\/D strut-braced designs,
the blended wing body (BWB), so called \u201cdouble-bubble\u201d designs
 and other concepts with large expanses of surface area would benefit
from effective viscous drag control.Viscous skin friction can be
classified as either laminar or turbulent. While the laminar case and
its attendant laminar flow control (LFC) techniques remain important
scientific and technological disciplines, the goal of high Reynolds
number flight efficiency requires that the turbulent case receive
renewed attention. In place of the first-principles-derived theoretical
framework of the laminar flow stability problem, in the turbulence case
we have a wide collection of experimental observations, data
correlations, various CFD approaches requiring turbulence closure models
 and, at low Reynolds numbers, full direct numerical simulation of the
Navier-Stokes equations (DNS). While such experimental and CFD-derived
knowledge, has greatly increased our understanding of turbulent boundary
 layer physics over the past decades, key relationships between wall
layer and outer layer dynamics essential to a full understanding remain
to be identified and verified.Inadequacies in our understanding of
boundary layer turbulence increase reliance upon a more qualitative,
physics-guided approach to discovery. For example, the experimental
observation of reduced skin friction in the corners of triangular
cross-section pipes lead to the discovery of drag-reducing V-groove
riblets (subsequently also associated with the skin of certain shark
species). The quasi-periodic, low-speed streak structures observed in
the near-wall layer of turbulent boundary layers lead to the
implementation of mechanically controlled spanwise waves or lateral
oscillations of the wall to disrupt the processes associated with low
speed streak bursting. Similar observations have either been made or
suggested with respect to the stabilizing influence of convex and
in-plane curvature; long length-to-diameter ratio particulates; passive,
 active and reactive wall motion; manipulation of the wall layer by
various geometrical devices (e.g., vortex generators (VG) and large eddy
 breakup devices (LEBU)), and various weakly ionized gas (WIG) and
magnetohydrodynamic\/electrohydrodynamic (MHD\/EHD) concepts. This
solicitation is offered in this spirit of innovation based on
experimental or computational observations guided by a basic, though not
 necessarily complete, physical understanding of the turbulent
processes.\u00a0In order to stimulate innovation in the area of
turbulent viscous drag reduction, proposals are sought subject to the
following guidelines:Proposals shall address passive, active or reactive
 concepts for external, attached, fully developed, turbulent boundary
layer viscous drag reduction in air.Experimental, hardware\u2013based
proposals and theoretical\/computational proposals based on realizable
hardware are preferred.All practical physical concepts are acceptable
including but not limited to: mechanical\/electro-mechanical actuators,
weakly-ionized-gas (WIG) concepts, laser\/microwave energy deposition,
MHD\/EHD devices, surface microstructure\/geometry, embedded mechanical
devices (VG\u2019s, LEBU\u2019s), wall mass transpiration, heat
transfer, wall motion, wall curvature effects and pressure gradient
(vehicle shaping).Significant enhancements or refinements of existing
concepts and technologies are acceptable.First order assessment or
technically plausible discussion of any net system energy saving claims
shall be provided.Proof-of-concept experimental demonstrations are
encouraged for Phase I where applicable but are not required.Target
conditions are flight-relevant Reynolds numbers at either high subsonic

Center(s):AFRC,ARC,LaRCProposals are sought which support electric
propulsion of transport aircraft, including turboelectric propulsion
(turbine prime mover with electric distribution of power to propulsors)
and various hybrid electric concepts, such as gas turbine engine and
battery combinations.Turboelectric propulsion for transport aircraft
applications will require components with high specific power (hp\/lb or
 kW\/kg) and high efficiency, and cryogenic and superconducting
components will likely be required. The cryogenic components of interest
 include fully superconducting generators and motors (i.e.,
superconducting stators as well as rotors), cryogenic inverters and
active rectifiers, and cryocoolers. Proposals related to the
superconducting machines may include aspects of the machines themselves
and their subcomponents, as well as low AC loss superconducting
materials for the stator windings. Generators with at least 10 MW
capacity and motors of 2 to 4 MW capacity are of interest. Technology is
 sought that can contribute to superconducting machines with specific
power more than 10 hp\/lb.Hybrid propulsion with non-cryogenic
components will likely require new materials and configurations to reach
 required high specific power and efficiency. Hence ideas are sought for
 achieving 2-3X increase in specific power at high efficiency for
non-cryogenic motors through a multidisciplinary approach utilizing
advanced motor designs, better materials, and new structural
concepts.New approaches to achieving conductors with lower electrical
resistivity than copper are particularly sought, e.g., conductors based
on carbon nanotubes. However, such approaches must be backed by
plausible reasons why a resistivity lower than that of copper can be
expected to be achieved, in contrast to the best reported resistivity
values for carbon nanotube fibers, which are nearly an order of
magnitude higher.Ideas are also sought to address challenges related to
high voltage power transmission in future hybrid electric aircraft.New

systems are also of interest.Some studies of turboelectric distributed

continues to investigate the potential of advanced, innovative
propulsion and aircraft concepts to improve fuel efficiency and reduce
the environmental footprint of future generations of commercial
transports across the breadth of the flight speed regimes. Propulsion
systems, such as open rotors and hybrid-electric propulsion, are viewed
as potential options for helping meet aggressive, long range (i.e.,
'N+3' timeframe) emission reduction targets. Accurate representation of
the propulsion system is critical in confidently assessing the potential
 of a concept. Conceptual design and analysis of unconventional
propulsion concepts and technologies is used for technology portfolio
investment planning, development of advanced concepts to provide
technology pull and independent technical assessment of new concepts.
The agency's systems analysts need to have the best conceptual

progress has been made recently in incorporating more physics-based
analysis tools in the conceptual design process, and NASA has developed a
 capability that integrates several analysis tools and models in
engineering frameworks, such as ModelCenter and OpenMDAO. However,
modeling gaps still remain in many disciplines.Historically, empirical

the conceptual design phase. These techniques work well for the
conceptual design of conventional propulsion systems with parameters
that reside within the historical databases used to develop the
methodologies. However, these methods are not well suited for
unconventional propulsion concepts, or even conventional concepts which
reside outside of the database. Developing higher order, more accurate
tools suitable for conceptual design is a difficult challenge. The first
 issue is analysis turnaround time. To perform the configuration trades
and optimization typical of conceptual design, runtimes measured in
seconds or minutes, instead of hours or days, are required. However,
rapid analysis turnaround time alone is insufficient. To be suitable for
 conceptual design, tools and methods are needed which accurately
predict the 'as-built' characteristics. Because it is not possible to
model every detail of the design and account for all the underlying
physics in the problem formulation, it is difficult to predict the
'as-built' characteristics with physics-based methods alone. What is
usually required is a combination of these methods with some
semi-empirical corrections. A final challenge in conceptual design is a
lack of detailed design information. Lower order, empirical-based
methods often require only gross design parameters as inputs. The gap
between the analysis capability and the maturity of the design being
analyzed currently limits the usefulness of high order analysis in
conceptual design. Physics-based tools for conceptual design are needed
which are consistent with the amount of design knowledge that is
available at the conceptual design stage.NASA has a well-established
propulsion systems analysis tool suite that is based on the Numerical
Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) and the Weight Analysis of Turbine
Engines (WATE) codes. Ideally, new capabilities that arise from this
solicitation should be compatible with NPSS and\/or WATE or offer
significantly increased capability beyond\/outside of these
state-of-the-art tools.For FY 2015, the focus is on addressing remaining
 capability gaps. Examples of desired capability improvements include
the following:\u00a0Physics-based methodologies and sizing of
hybrid-electric propulsion components.Weight\/volumetric estimates for
major components (e.g., batteries, fuel cells, motors, generators,
cryocoolers, transformers, inverters, rectifiers).Heat exchanger
performance and weight\/volume estimation modeling tools.Computational

Center(s):GRC,LaRCThe Vertical Lift subtopic is primarily interested in
the following two areas:\u00a0The use of small vertical lift UAVs has
increased in recent times with many civilian missions being proposed,
including autonomous surveillance, mapping, etc. Much of the current
research associated with these vehicles has been in the areas of
electric propulsion, batteries, small sensors and autonomous control
laws, while very little attention has been paid to their acoustic
signature. The generation and propagation of noise associated with this
small class of vertical lift UAVs are not well understood and validated
prediction tools do not currently exist. The objective of a proposed
effort would be to develop tools for the modeling and prediction of the
high frequency acoustics for small vertical lift UAVs, such as
quad-copters, coaxials, ducted fan rotors, etc.A transition to
low-carbon propulsion has the promise of dramatically reducing the
emissions from full-scale rotorcraft, as well as reducing overall fuel
consumption and operating cost. All electric and hybrid propulsion
systems could be beneficial to rotorcraft due to high power requirements
 of hover and integrated motor-drive systems designs that could be
realized. The objective of a proposed effort would be to develop and
demonstrate hybrid\/electric technologies for full-scale rotorcraft
drive and propulsions systems that show benefits in-terms of weight,
efficiency, emissions and fuel consumption. Validated modeling and
analysis tools for all-electric and hybrid propulsions systems are also
sought in this solicitation.Proposals on other rotorcraft technologies

        "description": "Lead Center:GRC\u00a0For 2014, this sub-topic
will focus on propulsion controls and dynamics. Propulsion controls and
dynamics research is being done under various projects in the
Fundamental Aeronautics Program (FAP) and Aviation Safety Program (ASP).
 For turbine engines, work on Distributed Engine Control (DEC) and
Active Combustion Control (ACC) is currently being done under the
Aeronautics Sciences (AS) project, and is expected to transition to the
new Transformative Tools and Technologies (TTT) project in FY15.
Aero-Propulso-Servo-Elasticity (APSE) research will continue under the
High Speed project. Model-Based Engine Control research is currently
being conducted under the Vehicle System Safety Technologies project,
and is expected to transition to the TTT project in FY15. Propulsion
controls and dynamics technologies that help achieve the goals of the
following NASA ARMD strategic thrusts: Innovation in Commercial
Supersonic Aircraft; Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles; and Assured
Autonomy for Aviation Transformation, will be given preference.
Following technologies are of specific interest:\u00a0High Efficiency
Robust Engine Control - Typical current operating engine control logic
is designed using SISO (Single Input Single Output) PI
(Proportional+Integral) control. The control logic is designed to
provide minimum guaranteed performance while maintaining adequate safety
 margins throughout the engine operating life. Additionally, the control
 logic indirectly provides control of variables of interest such as
Thrust, Stall Margin, etc. since these variables cannot be measured or
are not measured in flight because of restrictions on sensor
cost\/placement\/reliability, etc. All this results in highly
conservative control design with resulting loss in efficiency. NASA is
currently conducting research in Model-Based Engine Control (MBEC)
where-in an on-board real-time engine model, tuned to reflect current
engine condition, is used to generate estimate of quantities of interest
 that are to be regulated or limited and these estimates are used to
provide direct control of Thrust, etc. Alternate methods such as Model
Predictive Control, Adaptive Control, direct non-linear control, etc.
are of interest. However, the alternative methods must achieve the same
objectives as the current MBEC approach by providing practical
application of the control logic in terms of operation with sensor
noise, operation across varying atmospheric conditions, operation across
 varying engine health condition over the operating life, and real-time
operation within engine control hardware limits. The emphasis is on
practical application of existing control methods rather than
theoretical derivation of totally new concepts. Control design
approaches that can accommodate small to medium engine component faults
and can still provide desired performance with safe operation are of
special interest. The pre-requisite for proposals for engine control
design methods is that the NASA C-MAPSS40k (Commercial Modular
Aero-Propulsion System Simulation for 40,000 lb class thrust engine) be
used for control design and evaluation. This simulation can only be used
 by U.S. citizens since it is subject to export control laws. Methods
for real-time engine parameter identification using flight data are also
 of interest by themselves.Distributed Engine Control - Current engine
control architectures impose limitations on the insertion of new control
 capabilities primarily due to weight penalties and reliability issues
related to complex wiring harnesses. Obsolescence management is also a
primary concern in these systems because of the unscheduled cost impact
and recertification issues over the engine life cycle. NASA in
collaboration with AFRL (Air Force Research Lab) has been conducting
research in developing technologies to enable Distributed Engine Control
 (DEC) architectures. Modularity is an inherent feature of distributed
engine control architecture. Modularity enables the rapid integration of
 the individual functions of control into a cohesive system by virtue of
 common digital interfaces and the well-defined flow of data. This
interface structure can persist regardless if the control function
exists in hardware or simulation. At the engine system level,
distributed architecture enables scalability and reuse of control
functional elements across engine platforms, but it also simplifies the
insertion of new control technologies within the smart devices. NASA is
interested in the development and simulation of these distributed
control functions for high temperature embedded application on the
engine core. NASA is particularly interested in the design and
development of these applications for assessing the benefit they bring
to the engine system.Active Combustion Control - The overall objective
is to develop all aspects of control systems to enable safe operation of
 low emissions combustors throughout the engine operating envelope. Low
emission combustors are prone to thermo-acoustic instabilities. So far
NASA research in this area has focused on modulating the main or pilot
fuel flow to suppress such instability. Advanced, ultra-low emissions
combustors utilize multi-point (multi-location) injection to achieve a
homogeneous, lean fuel\/air mixture. There is new interest in using
precise control of fuel flow in such a manner as to suppress or avoid
thermo-acoustic instabilities. Miniature fuel metering devices (and
possibly also fuel flow measurement devices) are needed that can be
physically distributed to be close to the multi-point fuel injector in
order to enable the control system to accurately place a given
proportion of the overall fuel flow to each of the fuel injection
locations.Aero-Propulso-Servo-Elasticity (APSE) - The objective of NASA
research effort in APSE is to develop a comprehensive variable cycle
engine (VCE) type dynamic propulsion system model that can be utilized
for thrust dynamics and integrated APSE vehicle controls and performance
 studies, like vehicle ride quality and vehicle stability under typical
flight operations, vehicle maneuvering and atmospheric disturbances, for
 supersonic vehicles. Innovative approaches to dynamic modeling that are
 of interest include supersonic external compression inlets; multi flow
paths convergent-divergent type nozzles with a spike; parallel flow path
 modeling of propulsion components upstream of the combustor to
accurately model the distortion effects, maneuvering and atmospheric
disturbances; and integration of dynamic propulsion models with aircraft
 simulations incorporating flexible vehicle structural modes.",

subtopic supports the experimental modeling and simulation requirements
of NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, as well as the
testing requirements of other government and commercial entities. The
subject facilities are managed by the Aeronautics Evaluation and Test
Capability (AETC) Project within the NASA Advanced Air Vehicles Program.
 The primary objective of this subtopic is to develop innovative tools
and technologies that enhance testing and measurement capabilities,
improve ground test resource utilization and efficiency, and provide
capability sustainment. Where possible, the tools and technologies
should be applicable for the broad national scope of government,
commercial, and university capabilities.Wind tunnel vehicle design
databases have traditionally included the foundational measurements of
forces and discrete surface pressures and temperatures. However,
designing and testing future vehicles with non-traditional aerodynamic
geometries, possibly including highly integrated and distributed
propulsion and flow control systems, will require enhanced, remotely
sensed global surface measurements that cover a wide range of
operational conditions. Enhanced optical systems are required to
visualize the flow interactions both on and off the surface.
Non-intrusive measurement systems offering multi-component velocities,
density, and pressure in the tunnel stream are required to routinely
quantify and baseline the test environment and to establish boundary
conditions for advanced computational simulations. Non-intrusive
measurements of off-body and near-body flow parameters both at a point
and globally (i.e., planar or volumetric) are necessary to examine
fluid-fluid and fluid-structure interactions for computational solution
validation. The development of diagnostics for simultaneous volumetric
measurements are particularly desired and will require a concentrated
research effort in the development of enhanced laser and imaging
techniques (including light field imaging), the development of new
optical configurations, and the development of near real-time to
real-time acquisition and processing architectures. In particular,
development of techniques that significantly increase data capture per
test point are needed, including the ability to simultaneously measure
multiple flow parameters at high acquisition rates to capture rapidly
evolving or oscillatory flow phenomena. Maturation of current
particle-based, molecular, and\/or surface diagnostics and unification
of compatible instruments are desired. In all cases, significant
measurement accuracy enhancements are required. Measurement systems must
 be robust and user-friendly for practical and routine
application.Proposals for clean seeding methods that do not contaminate
wind tunnel walls or anti-turbulence screens are solicited. Seedless
methods for velocity measurements near a model surface are particularly
desired for adverse test environments where seeding contaminants are
prohibited, may alter the model surface flow, or possibly damage gas
reclamation systems. Two such environments occur at NASA Langley for
-250\u00b0F cryogenic testing at the National Transonic Facility and
heavy-gas testing using R134a at the Transonic Dynamics Tunnel.Proposals
 are also solicited for shear stress sensors that are applicable to
high-temperature\/high-flow-rate environments such as those encountered
in engine and high-speed testing where surface heating is
important.Small models and\/or packaging constraints for large models
can make model attitude measurements difficult. Testing in the
non-gravity direction precludes use of traditional angle sensors. Many
test configurations require multiple angle of attack systems, including
redundant systems to guard against in-test failure. Maintaining
calibration currency and accuracy of multiple systems significantly
increases test costs and complexity. Proposals are solicited for
accurate, real-time, optical, non-intrusive techniques for determining
model attitude.The impact of icing on vehicle performance for flight
certification is increasingly important. Currently, the NASA Glenn Icing
 Research Tunnel cannot reproduce the full range of test conditions
defined in the FAA Appendix O Supercooled Droplet Icing Conditions.
Simulation of Appendix O conditions for freezing rain and drizzle
scenarios requires a bimodal droplet distribution with much larger size
droplets. These large droplets have an extended cooling period before
entering the test section; and, they dont follow the flow, falling
toward the test section floor. Innovative ideas and technology
advancements are solicited to create and control Appendix O conditions
in current facilities.Many NASA wind tunnel facilities conduct tests at
elevated temperatures (400\u00b0F to 700\u00b0F) or at extremely low
temperatures (-250). Displacement measurement components in actuator
systems for the setting of hydraulic cylinder positions and other
hardware that is used in test article support and positioning systems
must operate routinely in these environments. Innovative designs and
hardware solutions are desired to provide accurate and reliable
performance at these extreme conditions.Additional information about the
 mission and facility capabilities may be obtained at

Center(s):LaRCUnmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) offer advantages over
manned aircraft for applications which are dangerous to humans, long in
duration, require great precision, and require quick reaction. Examples
of such applications include remote sensing, disaster response, delivery
 of goods, agricultural support, and many other known and yet to be
discovered. In addition, the future of UAS promises great economic and
operational advantages by requiring less human participation, less human
 training, an ability to take-off and land at any location, and the
ability to react to dynamic situations.NASA is involved in research that
 would greatly benefit from breakthroughs in UAS capabilities. Flight
research of basic aerodynamics and advanced aero-vehicle concept would
be revolutionized with an ability of UAS teams to cooperate and interact
 while making real time decisions based upon sensor data with little
human oversight. Commercial industry would likewise be revolutionized
with such abilities.There are multiple technological barriers that are

are:\u00a0Verification, Validation, and Certification - New inexpensive
methods of verification, validation, and certification need to be
developed which enable application of complex systems to be certified
for use in the national airspace system. Proposed research could include
 novel hardware and software architectures that enable or circumvent
traditional verification and validation requirements.Operation of

 operations. Proposed research could include novel hardware and software
 architectures which provide guarantees of safe UAS
operations.Multi-vehicle cooperation and interoperability - Technologies

 with others to find optimal routes, optimal task allocations, and
optimal use of resources. Proposed research could include hardware and
software architectures which enable UAS to operate in large cooperative
and interactive teamsSensing, perception, cognition, and decision making
 - Technologies need to be developed that provide the ability of UAS to
detect and extract internal and external information of the vehicle,
transform the raw data into abstract information which can be understood
 by machines or humans, and recognize patterns and make decisions based
on the data and patterns.Inexpensive, reliable, and secure
communications - Inexpensive methods which ensure reliable and secure
communications for increasingly interconnected and complex networks need
 to be developed that are immune from sophisticated cyber-physical
attacks.Phase I deliverables should include, but are not limited

Center(s):MSFC,GRC,KSC,JPLIn-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) involves
collecting and converting local resources into products that can reduce
mission mass, cost, and\/or risk of human exploration. The primary
destinations of interest for human exploration, the Moon, Mars and
it\u2019s moons, and Near Earth Asteroids, all contain regolith\/soil
that contain resources that can be harvested into products. The
resources of primary interest are water and other components that can be
 released from the regolith\/soil by heating, and oxygen found in the
minerals to make consumables for life support, power, and propulsion
system applications. State of the art (SOA) technologies for many ISRU
processes either do not exist, are too complex, are too inefficient
(mass, power, and\/or volume), or are not designed to operate in the
extraterrestrial environment in which the resource is found, especially
the micro-gravity environment for asteroids. The subtopic seeks
proposals for critical technologies associated with the design,
fabrication, and testing of hardware associated with extracting and
transferring regolith\/soil materials from extraterrestrial bodies and
processing the material to extract water\/volatiles and oxygen.
Technologies developed under this subtopic are applicable to feasibility
 testing on parabolic flights and the ISS, assessment and processing of
material on the redirected asteroid to trans-lunar space, and robotic
precursor missions to the lunar poles and surface of Phobos and Mars.
Proposals should address one or more of the categories below.Simulants
for Ground Testing\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1. Simulants for ordinary
chondrites (LL, L, H) and carbonaceous chondrites (CI, CM) asteroids
that replicate asteroid material characteristics such as physical
(particle size\/shape, particle size distribution, hardness), thermal,
mineral\/chemical , and volatile content for ground testing. Proposers
must justify proposed simulant components and preparation based on
documented research\/publications.Regolith\/Soil Acquisition and
PreparationThe first step in production of mission consumables from in
situ resources is acquisition and preparation of the resource for
processing. Proposals in this category should address one or more of the
 following:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2. Excavation, transfer, and preparation
 of hydrated and icy-soil\/regolith on Mars.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3.
Excavation, transfer, and preparation of asteroidal material from
ordinary and carbonaceous chondrite asteroids.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4.
Excavation, transfer, and preparation of lunar polar icy regolith.Notes:
 Proposals must address both the physical\/mineral properties of the
regolith\/soil and the environmental conditions of the resources
location. For item 3 proposals must address options for anchoring or
maintaining position at the site of excavation to overcome forces
applied during excavation and transfer of asteroidal material. Concepts
need to minimize the generation of material that can float off and
create a hazard. The proposal must identify the potential mass, power,
and operation life impact of the selected option. All acquisition and
preparation proposals must identify and address any issues with
measuring and maintaining constant\/known material transfer rates, and
the impact of continuous versus batch-mode processing of the material.
Proposals can combine regolith\/soil acquisition and preparation with
processing if it allows for reduced mass, power, and\/or
complexity.Soil\/Regolith Processing for Mission ConsumablesOnce the
soil\/regolith has been acquired and prepared, it is ready for
processing. Proposals in this category should address one or more of the
 following:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5. Water\/volatile extraction and
separation from carbonaceous chondrites asteroidal material. Identify
potential contaminants for subsequent cleaning based on the method
utilized for volatile extraction. Besides water, carbon-based gases are
of significant interest for fuel and plastic production. Proposals
should consider additional steps (higher temperatures, reactants, etc.)
that may increase the extraction and collection of carbon-based gases.
Proposers are also encouraged to examine the applicability of
micro-gravity asteroidal processing techniques for crew\/trash waste
processing.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 6. Water\/volatile extraction and
separation from lunar polar icy material. Identify potential
contaminants for subsequent cleaning based on the method utilized for
volatile extraction.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 7. Water vapor and other
volatile separation and collection from other gases\/liquids. Separation
 techniques must address potential contaminants.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 8.
Regenerative dust separation from product and reactant gases.\u00a0
\u00a0 \u00a0 9. Oxygen extraction from ordinary and carbonaceous
chondrites asteroidal material. Regeneration of reactants used in oxygen
 extraction is required.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 10. Metal extraction from
ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites asteroidal material. Regeneration
of reactants used in metal extraction is required.Notes: Proposals must
specify whether the process is performed in batches or by continuous
processing with appropriate sealing techniques to minimize
reactant\/product losses identified. Proposers are encouraged to address
 more than one of the Soil\/Regolith Processing needs above. Proposals
can combine regolith\/soil processing with acquisition and preparation
if it allows for reduced mass, power, and\/or complexity. Proposals
addressing only item 7 or 8 need to identify the potential
soil\/regolith processing technique it is applicable for as well as
minimum and maximum flow rates and\/or product\/reactant
concentrations.Further Requirements for ProposalsAll proposals need to
identify the SOA of applicable technologies and processes:\u00a0For
Lunar polar-based ISRU - Assume ice content in regolith is between 5 and
 10% at temperatures below 100 K. Regolith excavation down to at least 1
 meter below the surface is required for Phase II. Proposals must
address material transfer, handling, and processing of polar material
under temporary sunlight and continuous shadowed solar\/thermal
conditions.For Mars-based ISRU - Assume hydrated soils between 3 and 15%
 (nominal 8%); icy soils containing 40% or more of ice. Soil excavation
down to a minimum of 0.5 meters below the surface is required for Phase
II. Proposals must recognize and address issues with perchlorate
minerals in the Mars soil during processing and product separation. For
hydrated soils, proposals must consider meeting time averaged excavation
 and processing rates of 3.5 to 7 kg\/hr (8%) to 9 to 19 kg\/hr (3%)
soil to achieve time averaged water extraction and processing rates of
0.55 to 1.125 kg\/hr. Proposals must consider and address operating life
 issues for surface applications that can last for up to 480 days of
continuous operation.\u00a0For Asteroid-based ISRU - Technologies
requested are subscale to allow for future testing on the reduced
gravity assets and the ISS, but must be extensible to larger scale
applications. For testing on the ISS, proposed hardware will need to
process resource materials on the order of hundreds of grams to 5
kilograms within 1 to 5 hours to investigate
gravity-dependent\/independent phenomena. Proposed technologies must
show extensibility to future ISRU missions to an asteroid which will
require an increase in acquisition and processing by 1 to 2 orders of
magnitude with material excavation\/acquisition down to at least 3
meters. Proposals must address design and operation issues associated
with performing material transfer, handling, and\/or processing of solid
 material with gas, liquid, or molten reactants under micro-gravity and
vacuum conditions. Regolith processing reactors must further address
material transfer into the reactor before processing and removal from
the reactor after processing while minimizing loss of
reactants\/products and minimizing contamination of external
surfaces.\u00a0",

        "description": "Lead Center:GRCParticipating Center(s):JSCThe
goal of this SBIR call is the development of rapid and accurate hardware
 to characterize the net blood flow to and from the eye. Due to limits
on instrumentation, most of the literature on ocular blood flow to date
has emphasized measurements that only partially characterize the net
flow, such as minimum and maximum velocity in a single retinal arterial
vessel or choroidal thickness in the vicinity of the fovea. However,
there is significant spatial and interindividual variation in these
ocular structures, for example, in choroidal and retinal thickness and
in arterial and venous branching structures. Consequently, there are
likely to be new insights to be gained from examining the choroid and
retina from a bulk perspective. Recent advances in high-quality imaging,
 such as those based on wide-field Optical Coherence Tomography or
high-resolution angiography, have allowed increased depth of penetration
 at high resolution for unparalleled accuracy in choroidal and retinal
measurements that extend well beyond the posterior pole of the eye. The
ready availability of computational resources renders it straightforward
 to capture and analyze the entire time history of ocular
hemodynamics.\u00a0This SBIR solicits novel hardware that can quantify
net ocular blood flow in the retina. Measurements of interest include
the temporal history of the following:\u00a0Maps of choroidal and
retinal thickness, which include near- and far-field contributions.Net
volume of the choroid and retina.Net volumetric blood flow to and from
the choroid and retina.Pressures and net luminal areas at the entrance
and exit of the choroid and retina.Measurements must be presented in
physical units, such as blood flow in milliliters per minute. The
measurement system must also process the raw data, either in a real-time
 or post-processing mode. Data analysis capabilities should include the
calculation of the overall time-averaged mean values, as well as the
mean waveform over a cardiac cycle. It would be of significant interest
if comparable measurements were made simultaneously of intraocular
pressure, reference arterial pressure (systemic, brachial and\/or
ophthalmic artery), fundus pulsation amplitude, and\/or heart rate.Phase

of the above measurements.Phase II Deliverables - Prototype hardware and

design and associated hardware and software impose cognitive and
physical demands on an operator and thus, drive the workload associated
with a task. This solicitation is looking for technologies and methods
to measure, assess, and predict astronaut workload unobtrusively, and to
 extend these technologies to measuring and predicting astronaut
workload during long duration operations. Unobtrusive measures would be
ones that do not require operators to specifically interact with a
technology or provide inputs, and would not interrupt an operator\u2019s
 work.\u00a0Astronauts on long-duration missions will potentially have
long periods of low workload and short bursts of high workload combined
with reduced workload capacity that needs to be taken into account for
system and mission design. Both high task demand and reduced workload
capacity at any phase of a flight may lead to performance errors, which
could potentially compromise mission objectives, and consequently the
mission.\u00a0Astronauts, mission planners, and system designers require
 the capability to assess and predict when astronauts will be at a
reduced capacity resulting from either work underload or from work
overload. An unobtrusive workload tool could be used during development
to ensure a system produces acceptable workload, or in real-time, to
drive schedule modifications or to adapt interfaces based on the current
 workload the astronaut is experiencing. Unobtrusive objective measures
such as video, voice, thermal infrared imaging or eye tracking methods
may be more appropriate when measuring long duration workload, so long
as the technology\u2019s credibility is ensured.\u00a0Phase I of this
SBIR is to complete a review of the current state of the art in
automatically, unobtrusively measuring and tracking workload and
informing astronaut of such workload levels in scenarios that are
applicable to long duration missions. This Phase I effort will identify
suitable unobtrusive measurement technologies and the parameters that
need to be included in a candidate workload algorithm and subsequently
generate the algorithm. NASA has already supported the development of
wrist and arm-worn devices, therefore any unobtrusive wearables proposed
 should consider alternative concepts and\/or new implementations of
existing wearable technologies. Phase II of this SBIR is to take the
current state of the art and recommendations from the Phase I effort to
develop an unobtrusive workload measurement tool prototype, and test and
 validate the tool.\u00a0",

skeletal muscle size and function are well documented, however, the true
 time course of muscle adaptations during long duration spaceflight have
 thus far been unaddressed. This information is of importance because it
 can help to identify:\u00a0When the most critical stages of adaption to
 space are occurring.Whether changes are occurring at a constant rate or
 if they begin to plateau, and if so when.Targeted muscle
countermeasures to mitigate true muscle loss.Muscle protein synthesis
and breakdown are typically measured via invasive biopsy which will not
be feasible during space flight missions. Current terrestrial assays for
 protein synthesis involve use of stable isotopes to measure
incorporation of amino acids into muscle and are determined in muscle
biopsy samples. Markers for protein degradation (e.g., MuRF1, Atrogen-1)
 in muscle biopsy samples are often determined by real time PCR (mRNA
expression) or Western blot analysis (protein expression), though these
results are primarily qualitative. This subtopic seeks novel, non- or
minimally-invasive technologies to measure muscle protein turnover for
use in subsequent research studies. The most important measurement would
 be a synthesis: breakdown ratio indicative of the state of muscle
balance (formation, breakdown or stability) as opposed to exact protein
synthetic rates. However, absolute protein synthesis and breakdown rates
 are highly desirable.This Subtopic addresses the following Human

 examples:\u00a0Providing additional on-orbit analytical tools.
Development of instruments for on-orbit analysis of plants, cells, small
 mammals and model organisms including Drosophila, C. elegans, and
yeast. Instruments to support studies of bone and muscle loss,
multi-generational species studies and cell and plant tissue are

in gas-liquid flows. Instruments must be capable of a high temporal
acquisition (200 Hz or greater) with resolution between phase boundaries

Center(s):JSC,KSC,ARCThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) has a long-term strategy to fabricate components and equipment
on-demand for crew exploration missions. The greater the distance from
Earth and the longer the mission duration, the more difficult resupply
becomes; thus requiring a significant change from the current space
travel supply chain model. The ISS is an ideal platform to begin testing
 and transitioning from the current model for resupply and repair to one
 that is more suitable for exploration missions. 3-D Printing, more
formally known as Additive Manufacturing, is the method of building
parts\/objects\/tools layer-by-layer. 3-D Printers on-board ISS will use
 extrusion-based additive manufacturing, which involves building an
object out of plastic deposited by a wire-feed via an extruder head.
While this process does provide on-demand capability for printing parts,
 to truly develop a self-sustaining, closed-loop on-orbit manufacturing

available materials will ultimately be required.NASA seeks launch

recyclable processing into 1.75mm filament and subsequently 3-D printed
parts. This capability will significantly decrease current waste and
substantially increase sustainability. The solution may be obtained

3-D printing feedstocks into packing solutions, including but not
limited foam or bags.Transforming traditional packing materials into 3-D

 technology options associated with space engines that use methane as
the propellant. Successful proposals are sought for focused investments
on key technologies and design concepts that may transform the path for
future exploration of Mars. In-space propulsion is defined as the
development and demonstration of technologies for ascent, orbit
transfer, pulsing attitude\/reaction control, and descent engines. Key
operational and performance parameters include:\u00a0Reaction control
thruster development in the 5 to 100 lbf thrust class with a target
vacuum specific impulse of 325-sec. The reaction control engines would
operate cryogenic liquid-liquid for applications requiring integration
with main engine propellants; or would operate gas-gas or gas-liquid for
 small total impulse type applications. RCEs operating on liquid
cryogenic propellant(s) should be able to tolerate operation for limited
 duty cycles with gaseous or saturated propellants of varying
quality.Ascent\/descent pressure-fed engines with 1,500 to 25,000 lbf

Center(s):GRC,SSCSolid core NTP has been identified as an advanced
propulsion concept which could provide the fastest trip times with fewer
 SLS launches than other propulsion concepts for human missions to Mars
over a variety of mission years. The current NASA Strategic Space
Technology Investment Plan states NTP is a high priority technology
needed for future human exploration of Mars. NTP had major technical
work done between 1955-1973 as part of the Rover and Nuclear Engine for
Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA) programs. A few other NTP programs
followed including the Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (SNTP) program
in the early 1990's. The NTP concept is similar to a liquid chemical
propulsion system, except instead of combustion in the thrust chamber, a
 monopropellant is heated with a fission reactor in the thrust chamber.
In addition, the engine components and surrounding structures are
exposed to a radiation environment formed by the reactor during
operation.   \n This solicitation will examine a range of modern
technologies associated with NTP using solid core nuclear fission
reactors and technologies needed to ground test the engine system and
components. The engines are pump fed ~15,000-35,000 lbf with a specific
impulse goal of 900 seconds (using hydrogen), and are used individually
or in clusters for the spacecraft's primary propulsion system. The NTP
can have multiple start-ups (&gt;4) with cumulative run time &gt;100
minutes in a single mission, which can last a few years. The
Rover\/NERVA program ground tested a variety of engine sizes, for a
variety of burn durations and start-ups with the engine exhaust released
 to the open air. Current regulations require exhaust filtering of any
radioactive noble gases and particulates released to stay within the
current environmental regulations. The NTP primary test requirements can
 have multiple start-ups (&gt;8) with the longest single burn time ~50
minutes.\n\n   Specific engine technologies of interest to meet the
proposed requirements include:\n \n  \u0095 High temperature (&gt;
2600K), low burn-up composite, carbide, and\/or ceramic-metallic
(cermet) based nuclear fuels with improved coatings and\/or claddings to
 maximize hydrogen propellant heating and to reduce fission product gas
release and particulates into the engine's exhaust stream.\n     \u0095
Long life, lightweight, reliable turbopump modeling, designs and
technologies including seals, bearing and fluid system components.
Throttle ability is also considered.  Zero net positive suction head
(NPSH) hydrogen inducers have been demonstrated that can ingest 20-30%
vapor by volume.  The goal would be to develop inducers that can ingest
55% vapor by volume for up to 8 hours with less than 10 percent head
fall off at the design point.  Develop the capability to model (predict)
 turbopump cavitation dynamics.  This includes first order rotating and
alternating cavitation (1.1X \u00962X) and higher (6X-10X) order
cavitation dynamics.\n\u0095 High temperature and cryogenic radiation
tolerant instrumentation and avionics for engine health monitoring.
Non-invasive designs for measuring neutron flux (outside of reactor),
chamber temperature, operating pressure, and liquid hydrogen propellant
flow rates over wide range of temperatures are desired. Sensors need to
operate for months\/years instead of hours. Robonaut type inspections
for prototype flight test considered. \n   \u0095 Concepts to cooldown
the reactor decay heat after shutdown to minimize the amount of open
cycle propellant used in each engine shutdown. Depending on the engine
run time for a single burn, cool down time can take many hours. \n
\u0095 Low risk reactor design features which allow more criticality
control flexibility during burns beyond the reactor circumferential
rotating control drums, and\/or provide nuclear safety for ground
processing, launch, and possible launch aborts. \n \nSpecific ground
test technologies of interest to meet the proposed requirements include:
  \n\n\u0095 Effluent scrubber technologies for efficient filtering and
management of high temperature, high flow hydrogen exhausts. Specific
interests include:\n-Filtering of radioactive particles and debris from
exhaust stream having an efficiency rating greater than 99.9%.
\n-Removal of radioactive halogens, noble gases and vapor phase
contaminants from a high flow exhaust stream with an efficiency rating
greater than 99.5%\n\u0095 Technologies providing a low power nuclear
furnace to test a variety of fuel elements at conditions replicating a
full scale NTP engine.\n\nFor all above technologies, research should be
 conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a
 path towards Phase II hardware\/software demonstration with delivery of
 a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the
completion of the Phase II contract.\n    \nPhase I Deliverables -
Feasibility study, including simulations and measurements, proving the
proposed approach to develop a given product (TRL 2-3). Verification
matrix of measurements to be performed at the end of Phase II, along
with specific quantitative pass-fail ranges for each quantity listed. \n

Center(s):JSC,KSC,GRCMeasurement of Inorganic Species in Water There is
limited capability for water quality analysis onboard current
spacecraft. Several hardware failures have occurred onboard ISS which
demonstrate the need for measurement of inorganic contaminants.
Monitoring capability is of interest for identification and
quantification of inorganic species in potable water, thermal control
system cooling water, and human wastewater. Examples of inorganic
species of interest and their levels in potable water are specified in
Spacecraft Water Exposure Guidelines (SWEGs), released as JSC 63414
(Last revised - November 2008). Target compounds identified in the SWEGs
 that will be needed for exploration missions include ammonium,
antimony, barium, cadmium, manganese, nickel, silver, and zinc. But
there is also interest in measurement of other cations and anions
including iron, copper, aluminum, chromium, calcium, magnesium, sodium,
potassium, arsenic, lead, molybdenum, fluoride, bromide, boron, silicon,
 lithium, phosphates, sulfates, chloride, iodine, nitrate and nitrite.
Detection limits should be below 0.5 mg\/L where possible. The proposed
analytical instrument should be compact, microgravity compatible, and
have limited power and consumable requirements. Sample volumes should be
 minimized.Particulate Monitor for Air Instruments that measure indoor
aerosols in spacecraft cabins to monitor air quality and for
characterizing the background particle environment and major particle
sources are desired. Real-time measurement instruments must be compact
and low power, without volatile working fluids, intuitive for crew to
operate, requiring minimal maintenance, and able to maintain calibration
 for years. A large measurement range is necessary in low gravity due to
 the absence of gravitational settling, and it is expected that more
than one instrument, or a multi-sensor unit, will be required to cover
the desired range from nanometer (ultrafine) to 50 microns in diameter. A
 major portion of aerosols on the International Space Station (ISS) are
from lint and fibers, so instruments must not rely on spherical
morphology for accurate measurements. High accuracy should be
quantitatively demonstrated for the range of interest. Development of an
 instrument that covers a sub-range, as broad as possible, that
optimizes the performance within that range and that can subsequently be
 easily expanded, or integrated with other instrumentation, to cover the
 full range and requirements will also be of interest. Ideally, the
instrument would be portable, with a graphical user interface for crew
to read directly and also with the ability to log data and offer
standard data transfer interfaces for longer-term indoor air quality
surveys.Microbial Monitor NASA continues to invest in the near- and
mid-term development of highly-desirable systems and technologies that
provide innovative ways to monitor microbial burden and enable to meet
required cleanliness level of the closed habitat. To date, every attempt
 to monitor microbial communities on-board the ISS has relied on
traditional, culture-based approaches. Such techniques are laborious (7
days), require a considerable amount of crew time (up to 5 hrs), sample
return, and ground based analysis (1 month after sample return), and are
 fraught with difficulty, as different microbial species require various
 media or cultural conditions to grow. In current microbial quality
verification protocols, which use a single medium and a single culture
condition, many types of cells will go undetected.Molecular detection of
 biological agents offers increased sensitivity and specificity, such
that lower levels of contaminating material can be detected and
unambiguous identification can be achieved. NASA is interested in an
integrated molecular system that could combine all required steps such
as:\u00a0Sample
collection\/concentration\/extraction.Amplification\/enrichment.Detection.The

characteristics include:\u00a02 year shelf-life.Functionality in
microgravity and low pressure environment (~8 psi).Technologies that
show improvements in miniaturization, reliability, life-time,
self-calibration, and reduction of expendables are also of interest. The

 is interested in food production and related food safety technologies
for ISS, transit missions, and eventual surface missions (fractional
gravity). Of special interest is the use of photosynthetic organisms
such as plants to produce food, and contribute to cabin O2 production
and CO2 removal. Food production technologies should address how light
use efficiency will be improved to reduce energy costs, including
advanced electric and solar lighting concepts. Electric light sources
should achieve at least 1.5 \u00b5mol photosynthetically active
radiation per Joule of electrical energy, and solar collection systems
should achieve at least a 40% delivery efficiency of solar light.
Innovative concepts for gravity independent watering and nutrient
delivery techniques are also needed. Technical approaches could include
selecting or adapting the plants for optimal performance in smaller
growing volumes common to space. All systems should consider minimizing
power, mass, consumables, and biologically produced waste, while
maximizing reliability and efficiency. Consumables and waste products

technology innovation supporting the launch, entry, and abort (LEA) crew
 survival equipment needs for future human exploration beyond low-earth
orbit. Primary goals include development of technologies enhancing crew
survival in the launch, entry, and abort phases of flight as well as the
 post-landing environment, significant mass reduction of hardware, and
development of space-qualified survival hardware technologies designed
to operate after exposure to space vacuum and thermal effects. LEA crew
survival equipment development is a critical need tied to any future
manned Design Reference Mission (DRM) laid out by the agency, as well as
 providing benefit to both Orion\/MPCV and Commercial Crew Program
engineering efforts. Many candidate technologies will have direct
application to Orion\u2019s EM-2 mission and follow on manned
spaceflight activities.Systems and technologies relating to enhancement
of post-landing survival and rescue following manned exploration
spacecraft launch, entry, and abort (LEA) events are sought in the
following areas:\u00a0Lightweight Survival Life Raft Materials,
Construction Methods, and Related Technologies - Programmatic need
exists for a low mass, self-inflating life raft under 30 lbm.
Technologies should be directed to enable crew survivability in the post
 landing off-shore ocean environment meeting SOLAS and\/or FAA standards
 and Orion\/MPCV Design Specification for Natural Environments (DSNE)
sea state definitions while meeting a 30 lbm mass constraint. Of
particular interest is significant mass reduction in raft inflation
systems, innovative construction techniques and techniques \/ methods
for enhanced operability by long-duration spaceflight de-conditioned
crew members. The current space equivalent baseline is an FAA six person
 raft. Currently this type of raft does not exist without
\u2018breaking\u2019 the 30 lbm mass requirement or sacrificing
survivability attributes. Efforts should focus upon novel lighter weight
 materials and constructions methods, as well as inflation systems.
Another area of concern from the medical community is raft ops and
ingress by deconditioned crew members experiencing neurovestibular
effects of long-duration spaceflight.Suit-Integrated Global Coverage
Personal Locating Technologies - Current commercially-available Personal
 Locating Beacons (PLBs) are not optimized for use in the manned
spaceflight thermal and vacuum environment or integration into a
survival suit cover layer. Innovative technologies\/efforts should be
directed towards novel flexible patch antenna development, robust beacon
 packaging technologies, analytical methodology for integrated beacon
operational analysis, and beacon triggering (RF, saltwater, etc.)
technologies. Additionally, there is interest in prototype electronics
board development for use with future satellite-based GPS\/Doppler
locating systems such as the NASA-led Distress Alerting Satellite System
 (DASS). This technology development subheading also includes
development of high-reflectivity materials in the visible, IR, and radar
 wavelengths.Occupant Protection Materials, Analytical Tools, and
Technologies - Products and materials leading to enhanced occupant
protection in the capsule landing loads environment. Innovative
technologies and efforts should be directed towards acceleration,
vibration, and impact attenuation systems designed to mitigate dynamic
flight event impacts on the crew member. Of potential interest are
materials and products to protect crew members from head and neck
injuries during landing load shocks. Additionally, technologies such as
innovative restraint mechanisms preventing crew member flail and
flail-related injuries during dynamic flight events are of potential
interest. When considering impact attenuation material properties,
attention should be paid to preventing crew member exposure to rate
changes of acceleration greater than 500 g\/s. Material space-rating
requirements should be taken into account in relation to the manned
spaceflight thermal \/ vacuum environment. Within this subtopic,
analytical methods should be directed to prevention of extremity flail,
head, and neck injuries during linear, vibrational, and angular
acceleration events.In-Suit Waste Management Technologies - Development
of technologies allowing for long-duration waste management for use by a
 pressurized suited crew member. In the event of cabin depressurization
or other contingency, crew members may need to take refuge in LEA
pressure garments for a long-duration (144-hour) return trajectory back
to Earth. Technology development should be tailored to a 144-hour suited
 contingency, meeting the NASA Human Systems Integration Requirement
(HSIR) inside an LEA suit pressurized to 4.3 PSID referenced to the
ambient environment. Waste management technologies should address fecal
and urine waste containment and human physiological responses \/
countermeasures to long duration waste management in a pressurized
survival suit environment from one to six days. Advanced technologies
and materials should ideally provide for urine collection of up to 1L
per day per crew member, for a total of 6 days. Additionally, mitigation
 and\/or elimination of urine-generated ammonia inside the pressure
garment volume is a candidate area of interest. Fecal collection rates
should be targeted for 75 grams of fecal mass and 75 mL fecal volume per
 crew member per day for a total of 6 days duration.Research done in
Phase I of these efforts should focus on technical feasibility with an
emphasis on hardware development that can be further expanded in a
future Phase II award cycle. Phase II products must include a
demonstration unit suitable for testing by NASA. Prototyping should be

garments technology developments are focused on providing enabling
technologies for long-duration missions inclusive of extensive
extra-vehicular activity (EVA). To that end, priority technologies
address mass reductions, durability and reliability. Mass reduction for
exploration pressure garments is driven, in addition to launch mass
considerations, by the human factor of on-back weight for a planetary
walking suit configuration following a long-duration micro-gravity
transit, which may reduce astronaut load bearing capability. Driving
reference missions such as a1.5-year Mars surface stay include on the
order of 700 hours of EVA. Therefore, long-duration exploration missions
 require, in some cases orders of magnitude, increases in suit
durability or new approaches to providing long duration mission EVA
capability or logistics. The following technology areas address mass
reduction, increased durability, or both.Multi-function Materials The
pressure garment must perform functions such as: gas retention and
structural integrity including fall cases; mobility to perform science
and surface asset set-up and maintenance; and environmental protection
from thermal extremes, micrometeoroids and secondary impacts, dust, and
tears. The combination of performance of two or more of these functions
in single pressure garment material layer contributes to mass reduction.
 For example, a composite structure that provides gas retention,
structural integrity, and thermal protection\/regulation would be
beneficial. Another example would be a fabric that mitigates the effects
 of dust and is thermal protection in a single layer is
sought.Self-diagnosing and Self-healing Materials Fabric wear due to
repetitive joint cycling, dust and UV radiation exposure, and handling
is anticipated. To improve safety and decrease crew time investment in
the EVA system, materials that can indicate wear or self-heal are
valuable. Current materials with these capabilities are heavy, stiff, or
 require prohibitive power quantities. Ideally, self-diagnosing and
self-healing capabilities would be combined in with a material that also
 performs one of the functions described in the \u2018Multi-function
materials\u2019 sectionTitanium Bearings This topic addresses both mass
reduction and increasing durability. The emphasis on mass reduction is
countered by the need for increased mobility, which tends to increase
mass due to the addition of low torques bearings in joint mobility
systems. Titanium bearings are being incorporated to decrease the mass
of joint mobility systems. However, refinement of titanium bearings to
meet durability requirements is required based on 2014 bearing
in-configuration oxygen compatibility testing, which passed for
flammability, but indicated cycle wear issues. To address titanium
bearing wear, coatings, treatments, lubricants, ball material, and space
 ball materials are all considerations to be investigated. Titanium
bearings that can withstand 8 psi suit pressure plug loads in addition
to suit manloads over tens of thousands of cycles are required for
exploration pressure garments.Research done in Phase I of these efforts
should focus on technical feasibility with an emphasis on hardware
development that can be further expanded in a future Phase II award
cycle. Phase II products must include a demonstration unit suitable for
testing by NASA. Prototyping should be tailored to applications to

suit power, avionics and software (PAS) advancements are needed to
extend EVA capability on ISS beyond 2020, as well as future human space
exploration missions. NASA is presently developing a space suit system
called the Advanced Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AEMU). The AEMU PAS
system is responsible for power supply and distribution for the overall
EVA system, collecting and transferring several types of data to and
from other mission assets, providing avionics hardware to perform
numerous data display and in-suit processing functions, and furnishing
information systems to supply data to enable crew members to perform
their tasks with autonomy and efficiency. Current space suits are
equipped with radio transmitters\/receivers so that spacewalking
astronauts can talk with ground controllers and\/or other astronauts.
The astronauts wear headsets with microphones and earphones. The
transmitters\/receivers are located in the backpacks worn by the
astronauts only operate in the UHF band.While a sufficient amount of
radiation hardened electronics are available in areas such as serial
processors, digital memory and Field Programmable Gate Arrays, a
significant risk for the development of spacesuit avionics is the
non-availability certain ancillary electronic devices that are rated for
 spaceflight. NASA is, therefore, seeking flight rated electronic
devices needed to complement the existing inventory of flight rated
parts so as to enable the creation of an advanced avionics suite for
spacesuits. The suit and its corresponding avionics should be capable of
 being stowed inside a spacecraft outside the low-Earth orbit (LEO)
environment for periods of up to 5 years (TBR). Devices should also be
capable of supporting EVA sorties of at least 8 hours and total lifetime
 operational durations of at least 2300 hours (TBR) for a Mars surface
mission. Assumptions may be made for inherent radiation shielding
provided by the primary life-support system (PLSS) and possibly the
power, avionics, and software (PAS) subsystem enclosure, but proposers
are welcome to include shielding technologies at the board and
individual part level to reduce the radiation requirements of the actual
 device. Devices should be immune to single event latch-up (SEL) for
particles with Linear Energy Transfer (LET) values of at least 75
Mev-cm2\/mg. and maintain full functionality for total ionizing doses of
 at least 20 Krad (Si). Criticality 1 devices (life support) must be
fully mitigated against single event errors (SEE) for all potential
mission radiation environments, including solar flares. Lower
criticality devices can be less tolerant of SEEs, but must still operate
 with acceptable error rates in all potential radiation environments.
Power consumption should be no more than 2X similar COTS or mil-spec
devices. Devices should be vacuum compatible and need to support
conduction cooling. Need currently exists for a number of devices, as
described below. However this list should not be considered to be
exhaustive and proposals will be considered for other devices that are
peculiar to a spacesuit avionics suite. Additionally, proposals are
invited for simplified, low-cost and low-impact methods to adapt or test
 commercial or military-spec devices so as to yield a flight-rated part
to the above levels. In no particular order of priority, key innovations
 sought include:\u00a0Wireless Communication:802.11n baseband processor
that supports channel bonding and possibly multiple RF
channels.Low-power ( 24 kS\/s (threshold) and as high as 48 kS\/s
(goal). Requirements exist for 8 channel devices (threshold)
simultaneously sampled (&lt; 1 ps jitter) with a goal of 16 channels.
Devices should support a Least Significant Bit (in Pulse Code

 or less.Highly linear, high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) Micro Electro
Mechanical System (MEMS) microphones with PDM output. Microphones should
 exhibit &lt; 1% THD at 105 dBSPL (threshold) and 115 dBSP (goal).

 kHz and SNR &gt; 50 dB (threshold) and &gt; 60 dB (goal).High dynamic
range, audio frequency Digital to Analog Converters (DACS). Converters
should provide&gt;100 dB spur free dynamic range (TBR).High efficiency,
low power (&lt; 1 W output), audio frequency power amplifiers.High
efficiency, audio frequency pre amplifiers with adjustable gain (0 to 30

Deployable Solar Arrays NASA is currently developing solar array systems
 for solar electric propulsion in the 30-50 kW power range for near-term
 missions such as the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM). This subtopic
seeks structures and materials innovations for the next generation of
lightweight solar arrays beyond 50 kW. NASA has a vital interest in
developing much larger arrays over the next 20 years with up to 1 MW of
power (4000 m2 total deployed area) for SEP-powered exploration
missions. Scaling up solar array size by over an order-of-magnitude will
 require game changing innovations. In particular, novel
flexible-substrate designs are needed that minimize structural mass and
packaging volume while maximizing deployment reliability, deployed
stiffness, deployed strength, and longevity.Nominal solar array
requirements for large-scale SEP applications are:\u00a0Specific power

Hatches NASA is also seeking concepts for lightweight, deployable hatch

airlocks and habitats, and large-scale space hangars for on-orbit
assembly. The pressure vessel geometry could require hatches that
conform to flat, singly-curved, or doubly-curved surfaces. Concepts will
 be evaluated on mass efficiency, minimal packaging volume for launch,
operational reliability and simplicity, and strategy for integration
into a soft-goods structure. Proposals should detail a concept of
operations including packaged and deployed geometry, deployment

significant hardware or software capabilities should be developed and

scale up and manufacturability factors.Hot Structures \u2013 The focus
of this area is the development of cost effective, environmentally
durable and manufacturable material systems capable of operating at
temperatures from 1500\u00b0C to 3000\u00b0C, while maintaining
structural integrity. Significant reductions in vehicle weight can be
achieved with the application of hot structures, which do not require
parasitic thermal protection systems. This area seeks innovative
technologies in one or more of the following:Light-weight, low-cost,
composite material systems that include continuous fibers.Significant
improvements of in-plane and thru the thickness mechanical properties,
compared to current high temperature laminated composites.Decreased
processing time and increased consistency for high temperature
materials.Improvement in potential reusability for multiple missions.Low
 conductivity, low thermal expansion, high impact resistance.For all
above technologies, research, testing, and analysis should be conducted
to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path
towards Phase II hardware demonstration. Emphasis should be on the
delivery of a manufacturing demonstration unit for NASA testing at the
completion of the Phase II contract.Phase I Deliverables - Test coupons
and characterization samples for demonstrating the proposed material
product. Matrix of verification\/characterization testing to be
performed at the end of Phase II.Phase II Deliverables - Test coupons
and manufacturing demonstration unit for proposed material product. A
full report of the material development process will be provided along
with the results of the conducted verification matrix from Phase I.

 proposed Multifunctional Structures as one of their top 5 technical
challenges, and the NRC review of the roadmap recommended it as the top
priority in this area stating: \u201c\u2026 To the extent that a
structure can simultaneously perform additional functions, mission
capability can be increased with decreased mass. Such multifunctional
materials and structures will require new design analysis tools and
might exhibit new failure modes; these should be understood for use in
systems design and space systems operations.\u201dSome functional
capabilities beyond structural that are in this multifunctional theme
are: insulating (thermal, acoustic), inflatable, protective (radiation
and micrometeoroids and orbital debris), sensing, healing, in-situ
inspectable (e.g., IVHM), actuating, integral cooling\/heating, and
power generating (thermal-electric, photovoltaic \u2026), and so on.
Because of the broad scope possible in this SBIR subtopic, the intent is
 to vary its focus each year to address specific areas of
multi-functionality:\u00a0That have high payoff for a specific
mission.That are broadly applicable to many missions.That could find
broader applications outside of NASA which would allow for partnerships
to leverage the development of these technologies. For FY15, this SBIR
subtopic seeks innovative structures and materials technologies and
capabilities for three principle areas:Integration of acoustic
metamaterial concepts into the primary structure to reduce interior
acoustic and vibration environments. Specifically, innovations are
solicited which maintain the load bearing capability of the primary
structure while simultaneously reducing interior noise and vibration
levels below 400 Hz. Successful innovations are anticipated to enable
the design of lighter and cheaper spacecraft and launch vehicle
structures, as well as lower costs associated with ruggedizing and
qualifying spacecraft and launch vehicle secondary structures.Sensory
materials incorporated into a primary structure to provide health
monitoring data, and low-mass\/wireless methods of transmitting
localized structural responses to diagnostic models for material and
structural state. Manufacturing technologies capable of producing
structural components with embedded capability for sensing strain,
damage initiation and propagation, and temperature are of particular
interest. Ideally, the sensing technology should also augment the load
carrying capability or some other structural design requirement.
Technologies should enable weight reduction with similar or better
structural performance when compared to traditional approaches.Thin film
 conformal layers on structures or integrated in structures with
different functional capabilities. Examples include conformal solar
cells, conformal antennas, conformal energy storage, and conformal
energy harvesting. The conformal layer should provide additional
functionality to the structure without adversely affecting the load
bearing capability. The conformal functional layer offers the potential
for significant weight reduction and reduced complexity for spacecraft,
rovers, and habitats. For example, conformal photovoltaic layer on
spacecraft, rover, or habitat can eliminate the need for separate solar
array panels."",

Center(s):JSC,LaRC,GRC,JPLThe technologies described below support the
goal of developing advancements in instrumentation systems, inspection
techniques, and analytical modeling for the higher performance Ablative
Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) materials currently in development for
future Exploration missions. The ablative TPS materials currently in
development include felt or woven material precursors impregnated with
polymers and\/or additives to improve ablation and insulative
performance.Two classes of materials are currently in development for
planetary aerocapture and entry. The first class is for a rigid mid L\/D
 (lift to drag ratio) shaped vehicle with requirements to survive a dual
 heating exposure, with the first at heat fluxes of 400-500 W\/cm2
(primarily convective) and integrated heat loads of up to 55 kJ\/cm2,
and the second at heat fluxes of 100-200 W\/cm2 and integrated heat
loads of up to 25 kJ\/cm2. These materials or material systems are
likely dual layer in nature, either bonded or integrally manufactured.
The second class is for a deployable aerodynamic decelerator, required
to survive a single or dual heating exposure, with the first (or single)
 pulse at heat fluxes of 50-150 W\/cm2 (primarily convective) and
integrated heat loads of 10 kJ\/cm2, and the second pulse at heat fluxes
 of 30-50 W\/cm2 and heat loads of 5 kJ\/cm2. These materials are either
 flexible or deployable.Also currently in development is a third class
of materials, for higher velocity (&gt;11.5 km\/s) Earth return, with
requirements to survive heat fluxes of 1500-2500 W\/cm2, with radiation
contributing up to 75% of that flux, and integrated heat loads from
75-150 kJ\/cm2. These materials are currently based upon 3-D woven
architectures.Technologies sought are:\u00a0Development of in-situ
sensor systems including pressure sensors, heat flux sensors, surface
recession diagnostics, and in-depth or structural interface thermal
response measurement devices, for use on rigid and\/or flexible ablative
 materials. Individual sensors can be proposed; however, instrumentation
 systems that include power, signal conditioning and data collection
electronics are of particular interest. In-situ heat flux sensors and
surface recession diagnostics tools are needed for flight systems to
provide better traceability from the modeling and design tools to actual
 performance. The resultant data can lead to higher fidelity design
tools, improved risk quantification, decreased heat shield mass, and
increases in direct payload. The pressure sensors should be accurate to
0.5%, heat flux sensors should be accurate within 20%, surface recession
 diagnostic sensors should be accurate within 10%, and any temperature
sensors should be accurate within 5% of actual values. These should
require minimum mass, power, volume, and cost; MEMS-based, wireless,
optical, acoustic, ultrasonic, and other minimally-intrusive methods are
 possible examples. All proposed systems should utilize low-cost,
modular electronics that handle both digital and analog sensor inputs
and could readily be qualified for the space environments of interest.
Typical sensor frequencies are 1-10 Hz, with up to 200 channels of
collected data. Consideration should be given to those sensors that will
 be applicable to multiple material systems.Non Destructive Evaluation
(NDE) tools for evaluation of bondline and in-depth integrity for light-
 weight rigid and\/or flexible ablative materials. Non Destructive
Evaluation (NDE) tools are sought to verify design requirements are met
during manufacturing and assembly of the heat shield, e.g., verifying
that anisotropic materials have been installed in their proper
orientation, and that the bondline as well as the TPS materials have the
 proper integrity and are free of voids or defects. Void and\/or defect
detection requirements will depend upon the materials being inspected.
Typical internal void volume detection requirements are on the order of 6
 mm on a side (6x6x6), and bondline defect detection requirements are on
 the order of 25.4 mm by 25.4 mm by the thickness of the
adhesive.Advances are sought in ablation modeling, including radiation,
convection, gas surface interactions, pyrolysis, coking, and charring
for low and mid-density fiber based (woven or felt) ablative materials.
There is a specific need for improved models for low- and mid-density as
 well as multi-layered charring ablators (with different chemical
composition in each layer). The modeling efforts should include
consideration of the non-equilibrium states of the pyrolysis gases and
the surface thermochemistry, as well as the potential to couple the
resulting models to a computational fluid dynamics solver.Advances are
sought in modeling mechanical properties of 3-D woven materials. Tools
that analyze and predict the effects of different fibers on the warp and
 fill directional properties that could help in fiber selection and
weave design are sought.Starting Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of
2-3 or higher are sought.For all above technologies, research should be

seeks novel approaches to improve mission communication and navigation
capabilities for science and exploration through advancements in
cognitive systems and automation. Over the past 10 years software
defined radios and their applications have emerged and demonstrated the
potential and applicability of reconfigurable platforms and applications
 to space missions. The SCaN Testbed launched in 2012 demonstrated
software defined radio applications capable of sensing and reacting to
environment conditions. Building on this foundation, cognition and
automation have the potential to improve system performance, increase
data volume return, improve data transmission efficiency, and reduce
user spacecraft burden to improve science return from NASA missions.
Understanding how and where to apply cognitive and automation
technologies is critical and should be discussed in the proposal.This
solicitation seeks advancements in cognitive and automation systems and
components as applied to communication and navigation capabilities.
While there are a number of acceptable definitions of cognitive
systems\/radio, for simplicity, a cognitive system should sense, detect,
 adapt, and learn from its environment to improve the communications or
navigation capabilities for the mission. The goal is to improve the
state of the user spacecraft system to maximize science data return,
enable substantial efficiencies, or adapt to unplanned scenarios. While
much interest in cognitive radio entails dynamic spectrum access, this
subtopic is also interested in other ways to apply cognition and
automation. Areas of interest to develop and\/or demonstrate are as
follows:\u00a0Cognitive engine (algorithm) and component development -
to demonstrate new capability in sensing and adapting to the
radio\/mission environment. Technologies may include changes in physical
 (PHY) layer data rate, modulation, and coding, medium access control
(MAC) layers for new protocols, and cognitive engines to negotiate
changes between nodes and throughout the network, learning opportunities
 and techniques, and networking and application layers (and across
layers) to adjust to signal conditions, efficiently using links for
different data types (e.g., telemetry v. video), adaptive and
intelligent routing, etc.System wide distributed intelligence of
cognitive and intelligent applications - while much of the current
research often describes negotiations and improvements between two radio
 nodes, the subtopic seeks solutions to understand system wide aspects
and impacts of this new technology. Areas of interest include (but not
limited to) system wide effects (e.g., protocols) to decisions made by
one or more communication\/navigation elements, how to handle unexpected
 or undesired decisions, how changing data rate, modulation, or
frequency between nodes effects data distribution through relay
satellites, and throughout space and ground network and multiple access
techniques that optimize connectivity and throughput while minimizing
onboard data storage and interference.Flexible and adaptive hardware
systems - (e.g., signal processing platforms, adaptive front ends for RF
 or optical communications, and other intelligent electronics) which
directly implements or demonstrates cognitive or intelligent
applications as an alternative to more general software-based
intelligent systems. Systems should highlight advancements to provide
needed capability while minimizing on-board resources and
cost.Autonomous Ka-band and\/or optical communications antenna pointing
on mission spacecraft within intelligent multiple access systems -
Future mission spacecraft in low Earth orbit may need to access both
shared relay satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) and direct to
ground stations via Ka-band (25.5-27.0 GHz) and\/or optical (1550 nm)
communications for high capacity data return. To maximize the use of
this capacity, user spacecraft will need to point autonomously and
communicate with both the relays and ground terminals on a coordinated,
non-interfering basis along with other spacecraft using these same
space- and ground-based assets. Areas of interest include (but are not
limited to): autonomous navigation and pointing techniques with
sufficient precision to minimize pointing loss; techniques to coordinate
 multiple autonomous activities and adaptive or cognitive radio systems
that can continuously maximize data return via both multiple beam GEO
relays and direct to ground links.For all technologies, Phase I will
emphasize research aspects for technical feasibility, clear and
achievable benefits (e.g., 2x-5x increase in throughput, 25-50%
reduction in bandwidth, improved quality of service or efficiency) and
show a path towards Phase II hardware\/software demonstration with
delivery of a demonstration unit or software product for NASA testing at
 the completion of the Phase II contract.Phase I Deliverables -
Feasibility study and concept of operations of the research topic,
including simulations and measurements, proving the proposed approach to
 develop a given product (TRL 3-4). Delivery of the simulation or
demonstration software and\/or platform(s) to NASA. Plan for
verification of specific measurements or capabilities to be performed at
 the end of Phase II.Phase II Deliverables - Working engineering model
of proposed product\/platform or software, along with full report of
development, capabilities, and measurements (showing specific
improvement metrics). User\u2019s guide and other documents as necessary
 for NASA to recreate and use the demonstration capability or hardware
component(s). Opportunities and plans should also be identified and
summarized for potential commercialization.Depending on the status at
the time, there may be opportunity to port software (cognitive engines
and applications) to the SCaN Testbed software defined radio ground
and\/or flight system on International Space Station (ISS) for
demonstration and\/or test in the actual space environment. At a
minimum, the SCaN Testbed ground system radio testbed will provide an
ideal cognitive application test environment, as user spacecraft, relay
satellites, and control centers are all emulated in hardware. Software
applications and infrastructure should consider the NASA standard for
software defined radios, the Space Telecommunications Radio System
(STRS), NASA-STD-4009 and NASA-HNBK-4009, found at

environment of approximately 150K. Cooling systems providing cooling
capacities of approximately 0.3W at 35K with heat rejection capability
to temperature sinks at 150 K or lower are of interest.Sub-Kelvin
Cooling Technologies - Contemporary ADR systems provide the highest
cooling capacities and the lowest load temperatures of all sub-Kelvin
techniques viable for space application. Cultivation of additional
technology options are of interest. Candidate technologies for
investigation may include closed cycle dilution cooling and\/or
alternative magnetic refrigeration techniques and cycles.Continuous Flow
 Distributed Cooling Systems - Distributed cooling provides increased
lifetime of cryogen fluids for application on both the ground and
spaceborne platforms. This has impacts on payload mass and volume for
flight systems which translate into costs (either on the ground, during
launch or in flight). Mission enabling components for use with
distributed cooling systems are sought. Examples of such include
cryo-valves and integral\/non-integral cryocooler
components.\u00a0Proposals considered viable for Phase I award will seek
 to validate hypotheses through proof of concept testing at relevant

and for Heliophysics the 2009 technology roadmap can be downloaded here:
  http:\/\/science.nasa.gov\/heliophysics\/.  A major objective of SMD
instrument development programs is to implement science measurement
capabilities with smaller or more affordable spacecraft so development
programs can meet multiple mission needs and therefore make the best use
 of limited resources. The rapid development of small, low-cost remote
sensing and in situ instruments is essential to achieving this
objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the subtopics reflect
 a focus on instrument development for airborne and Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) platforms. Astrophysics has a critical need for sensitive
detector arrays with imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetric
capabilities, which can be demonstrated on ground, airborne, balloon, or
 suborbital rocket instruments. Heliophysics, which focuses on
measurements of the sun and its interaction with the Earth and the other
 planets in the solar system, needs a significant reduction in the size,
 mass, power, and cost for instruments to fly on smaller spacecraft.
Planetary Science has a critical need for miniaturized instruments with
in situ sensors that can be deployed on surface landers, rovers, and
airborne platforms. \n\nFor the 2012 program year, we are restructuring
the Sensors, Detectors and Instruments Topic, rotating out, combining
and retiring some of the subtopics.  Please read each subtopic of
interest carefully.  One new subtopic, S1.09 Surface and Sub-surface
Measurement Systems was added this year.  This new subtopic solicits
proposals that are for ground-based surface vehicles,and submerged
systems. Systems that will provide near-term benefit in a ground-based
application but that are ultimately intended for flight or mobile
platforms are in scope.  A key objective of this SBIR topic is to
develop and demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies
that reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of SMD observing
instruments and to enable new measurements. Proposals are sought for
development of components, subsystems and systems that can be used in
planned missions or a current technology program. Research should be
conducted to demonstrate feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path
towards a Phase 2 prototype demonstration. The following subtopics are
concomitant with these objectives and are organized by technology.",

structure of galaxies with very bright nuclei, binary star formation,
and stellar evolution. Contrast ratios of one million to ten billion
over an angular spatial scale of 0.05-1.5 arcsec are typical of these

scattered and diffracted light. The failure to control either amplitude
or phase fluctuations in the optical train severely reduces the
effectiveness of starlight cancellation schemes.\u00a0This innovative
research focuses on advances in coronagraphic instruments, starlight
cancellation instruments, and potential occulting technologies that
operate at visible and near infrared wavelengths. The ultimate

on the design and fabrication of complex space-based deployable
telescopes, additional risk reduction in operating an actively

Decadal Report specifically identified large light-weight mirrors as a
key technology needed to enable potential Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV),
Ultraviolet\/Optical (UV\/O) and Infrared (IR) to Far-IR
missions.\u00a02012 National Academy report \u201cNASA Space Technology
Roadmaps and Priorities\u201d states that one of the top technical
challenges in which NASA should invest over the next five years is
developing a new generation of larger effective aperture, lower-cost
astronomical telescopes that enable discovery of habitable planets,
facilitate advances in solar physics, and enable the study of faint
structures around bright objects.Finally, NASA is developing a heavy
lift space launch system (SLS) with an 8 to 10 meter fairing and 40 to
50 mt capacity to SE-L2. SLS will enable extremely large space
telescopes, such as a 12 to 30 meter class segmented primary mirrors for
 UV\/optical or infrared wavelengths.\u00a0Technical ChallengesTo
accomplish NASA\u2019s high-priority science requires low-cost,
ultra-stable, large-aperture, normal incidence mirrors with low
mass-to-collecting area ratios. Specifically needed for potential UVO
missions are normal incidence 4-meter (or larger) diameter 5 nm rms
surface mirrors; and, active\/passive align\/control of normal-incidence
 imaging systems to achieve &lt; 500 nm diffraction limit (&lt; 40 nm
rms wavefront error, WFE) performance. Additionally, recent analysis
indicates that an Exoplanet mission, using an internal coronagraph,
requires total telescope wavefront stability of less than 10 pico-meters
 per 10 minutes. Specifically needed for potential IR\/Far-IR missions
are normal incidence 12-meter (or larger) diameter mirrors with
cryo-deformations &lt; 100 nm rms.\u00a0In all cases, the most important
 metric for an advanced optical system (after performance) is
affordability or areal cost (cost per square meter of collecting
aperture). Current normal incidence space mirrors cost $4 million to $6
million per square meter of optical surface area. This research effort
seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components by 5 to 50
times, to less than $1M to $100K\/m2.\u00a0Technology development is
required to fabricate components and systems to achieve the following
Metrics:\u00a0Areal Cost &lt; $500k\/m2 (for UV\/Optical.Areal Cost &lt;
 $100k\/m2 (for Infrared).Monolithic: 1 to 4 meters.Segmented: &gt; 4

0.1 micro-radian (for EUV).Thermally Stable &lt; 10 pm\/10 min (for
Coronagraphy).Actuator Resolution &lt; 1 nm rms (for
UV\/Optical).\u00a0Finally, also needed is ability to fully characterize
 surface errors and predict optical performance.\u00a0Optical Components
 and Systems for potential UV\/Optical missionsPotential UV\/Optical
missions require 4 to 8 or 16 meter monolithic or segmented primary
mirrors with &lt; 10 nm rms surface figures and &lt; 10 pm per 10 min
stabilty. Mirror areal density depends upon available launch vehicle
capacities to Sun-Earth L2 (i.e., 15 kg\/m2 for a 5 m fairing EELV vs.
60 kg\/m2 for a 10 m fairing SLS). Regarding areal cost, it is necessary
 to keep the total cost of the primary mirror at or below $100M. Thus,
an 8-m class mirror (with 50 m2 of collecting area) should have an areal
 cost of less than $2M\/m2. And, a 16-m class mirror (with 200 m2 of
collecting area) should have an areal cost of less than $0.5M\/m2.Key
technologies to enable such a mirror include new and improved:Mirror
substrate materials and\/or architectural designs.Processes to rapidly
fabricate and test UVO quality mirrors.Mechanisms and sensors to align
segmented mirrors to &lt; 1 nm rms precisions.Thermal control to reduce
wavefront stability to less than 10 pm rms per 10 min.Vibration
isolation (&gt; 140 db) to reduce phasing error to &lt; 10 pm
rms.\u00a0Also needed is ability to fully characterize surface errors

 10 pico-meter wavefront stability include, but are not limited to:
metrology, passive and active control for optical alignment and mirror
phasing; active vibration isolation; metrology, passive and active
thermal control.\u00a0Optical Components and Systems for potential

require 12 m to 16 m to 24 meter class segmented primary mirrors with ~ 1
 \u03bcm rms surface figures which operates at &lt; 10 K.\u00a0There are
 two primary challenges for such a mirror system:\u00a0Areal Cost of
&lt; $100K per m2.Cryogenic Figure Distortion &lt; 100 nm

the capabilities need to enable potential future UVO and IR missions, it

Challenges\u00a0X-Ray Optical Component, Systems, and TechnologiesNASA
large X-Ray observatory requires low-cost, ultra-stable, light-weight
mirrors with high-reflectance optical coatings and effective stray light
 suppression. The current state-of-art of mirror fabrication technology
for X-Ray missions is very expensive and time consuming. Additionally, a
 number of improvements such as 10 arc-second angular resolutions and 1
to 5 m2 collecting area are needed for this technology. Likewise, the
stray-light suppression system is bulky and ineffective for wide-field
of view telescopes.\u00a0In this area, we are looking to address the
multiple technologies including: improvements to manufacturing
(machining, rapid optical fabrication, slumping or replication
technologies), improved metrology, performance prediction and testing
techniques, active control of mirror shapes, new structures for holding
and actively aligning of mirrors in a telescope assembly to enable X-Ray
 observatories while lowering the cost per square meter of collecting
aperture and effective design of stray-light suppression in preparation
for the Decadal Survey of 2020. Currently, X-Ray space mirrors cost $4
million to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area. This
research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components
by 5 to 50 times, to less than $1M to $100 K\/m2.\u00a0Coating
Technologies for X-Ray, EUV, Visible, and IR TelescopesThe optical
coating technology is a mission-enabling feature that determines the
optical performance and science return of a mission. Lowering the areal
cost of coating determines if a proposed mission could be funded in the
current cost environment. The current coating technology of optical
components needs to achieve TRL-6 by approximately 2018 to support the
2020 Astrophysics Decadal process. A number of optical coating metrics
specific each wavelength are desired as:\u00a0The Optical Coating
Metrics\u00a0X-Ray Metrics:\u00a0Multilayer high-reflectance coatings
for hard X-Ray mirrors similar to NuSTAR.Multilayer depth gradient
coatings for 5 to 80 KeV with high broadband
reflectivity.Zero-net-stress coating for iridium or other
high-reflectance elements on thin substrates (&lt; 0.5 mm).\u00a0EUV
Metrics:\u00a0Reflectivity &gt; 90% from 6 nm to 200 nm and depositable
onto a &lt; 2 meter mirror substrate.\u00a0UVOIR Metrics:\u00a0Broadband
 reflectivity &gt; 60% and uniform polarization from 90 nm to 2500 nm
and depositable onto 2, 4, and 6 meter mirror
substrates.\u00a0Non-Stationary Metric:\u00a0Non- uniform optical
coating to be used in both reflection and transmission that vary with
location and optical surface. Variation pertains to ratio of
reflectivity to transmissivity, optical field amplitude, phase, and
polarization change. The optical surface area ranges from1\/2 to 6
cm.\u00a0Freeform Optics Design, Fabrication, and Metrology\u00a0Future
NASA missions with alternative low-cost science and small-size payload
are constrained by the traditional spherical form of optics. These
missions could benefit greatly by the freeform optics as they provide
non-spherical optics with better aerodynamic characteristics for
spacecraft with lightweight components to meet the mission requirements.
 Currently, the design and utilization of conformal and freeform shapes
are costly due to fabrication and metrology of these parts. Even though
various techniques are being investigated to create complex optical
surfaces, small-size missions highly desire efficient small packages
with lower cost that increase the field of view and expand operational
temperature range of un-obscured systems. For the coronagraphic
applications, freeform optical components allow coronagraphic nulling
without shearing and increase the useful science field of view. In this
category, freeform optical prescription for surfaces of 0.5 cm to 6 cm
diameters with tolerances of 1 to 2 nm rms are needed. In this respect,
the freeform refers to either 2nd order conic prescription with higher
order surface polished onto it or without underlying conic prescription
with no steps in the surface. The optics with underlying conic
prescription would need to be in F\/# range of F\/2 to F\/20. In
addition to the freeform fabrication, the metrology of freeform optical
components is difficult and challenging due to the large departure from
planar or spherical shapes accommodated by conventional interferometric
testing. New methods such as multibeam low-coherence optical probe and
slope sensitive optical probe are highly desirable.",

exploration of planets, moons, and other small bodies in the solar

 Future spacecraft and constellations of spacecraft will have
high-precision propulsion requirements, usually in volume- and

SMD propulsion in chemical and electric propulsion systems related to
sample return missions to Mars, small bodies (like asteroids, comets,

electric propulsion technology innovations are also sought to enable low

 opportunities. The majority of small satellite missions flown are often
 selected for concept or component demonstration activities as the
primary objectives. Opportunities are anticipated to select future small
 satellite missions based on application goals (i.e., science return).
However, several technology limitations prevent high value science from
low-cost small spacecraft, such as post deployment propulsion
capabilities, Additionally, propulsion systems often place constraints
on handling, storage, operations, etc. that may limit secondary payload
consideration. It is desired to have a wide range of Delta-V capability

 is to use the vantage point of space to achieve with the science
community and our partners a deep scientific understanding of the Sun
and its effects on the solar system, our home planet, other planets and
solar system bodies, the interplanetary environment, and the universe
beyond. Scientific priorities for future planetary science missions are
guided by the recommendations of the decadal surveys published by the
National Academies. The goal of the decadal surveys is to articulate the
 priorities of the scientific community, and the surveys are therefore
the starting point for NASA\u2019s strategic planning process in
science.

 The most recent planetary science decadal survey, Vision and Voyages
for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013 - 2022, was released in 2011.
This report recommended a balanced suite of missions to enable a steady
stream of new discoveries and capabilities to address challenges such as
 sample return missions and outer planet exploration. Under this
subtopic, proposals are solicited to develop energy storage and power
electronics to enable or enhance the capabilities of future NASA science
 missions. The unique requirements for the power systems for these
missions can vary greatly, with advancements in components needed above
the current State of the Art (SOA) for high energy density, high power
density, long life, high reliability, low mass\/volume, radiation
tolerance, and wide temperature operation. Other subtopics which could
potentially benefit from these technology developments include S4.04
Extreme Environments Technology, and S4.01 Planetary Entry, Descent and
Landing Technology. This subtopic is also directly tied to S3.02
Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions for the development of
advanced Power Processing Units and associated components.\u00a0Power
Electronics and Management\u00a0NASA\u2019s Planetary Science Division
is working to implement a balanced portfolio within the available budget
 and based on the decadal survey that will continue to make exciting
scientific discoveries about our solar system. This balanced suite of
missions show the need for low mass\/volume power electronics and
management systems and components that can operate in extreme
environment for future NASA Science Missions. In addition, studying the
Sun, the heliosphere, and other planetary environments as an
interconnected system is critical for understanding the implications for
 Earth and humanity as we venture forth through the solar system. To
that end, the NASA heliophysics program seeks to perform innovative
space research missions to understand:\u00a0The Sun and its variable
activity.How solar activity impacts Earth and the solar
system.Fundamental physical processes that are important at Earth and
throughout the universe by using space as a
laboratory.\u00a0Heliophysics also seeks to enable research based on
these missions and other sources to understand the connections among the
 Sun, Earth, and the solar system for science and to assure human safety
 and security both on Earth and as we explore beyond it. Advances in
electrical power technologies are required for the electrical components
 and systems of these future spacecrafts\/platforms to address program
size, mass, efficiency, capacity, durability, and reliability
requirements. Radioisotope power systems (RPS) and In-Space Electric
Propulsion (ISP) are two programs of interest which would directly
benefit from advancements in this technology area. These types of
programs, including Mars Sample Return using Hall thrusters and power
processing units (PPUs), require advancements in radiation hardened
power electronics and systems beyond the state-of-the-art. Of importance
 are expected improvements in energy density, speed, efficiency, or
wide-temperature operation (-125 \u00b0C to over 450 \u00b0C) with a
number of thermal cycles. Novel approaches to minimizing the weight of
advanced PPUs are also of interest. Advancements are sought for power
electronic devices, components, packaging and cabling\/wiring for
programs with power ranges of a few watts for minimum missions to up to
20 kilowatts for large missions. In addition to electrical component
development, RPS has a need for intelligent, fault-tolerant Power
Management and Distribution (PMAD) technologies to efficiently manage
the system power for these deep space missions.\u00a0Also, in order to
maximize functional capability for Earth Observations, operate higher
performance instruments and deliver significantly better data and
imagery from a small spacecraft, more capable power systems are needed.
NASA is interested in a power system (stretch goal of 100w) that can be
integrated into a cubesat or nanosat for this purpose. The power system
package must be restricted to 6U or 3U volume, and the design should
minimize orientation restrictions. The system should be capable of
operating for a minimum of 6 months in LEO.\u00a0SMD's In-space
Propulsion Technology, Radioisotope Power Systems and Cubesat\/Nanosat
programs are direct customers of this subtopic.Overall technologies of
interest include:High voltage, radiation hardened, high temperature
power passive components.High power density\/high efficiency power
electronics and associated drivers for switching elements.Radiation
hardened, 1200 V (or greater) SiC MOSFETs and high speed diodes for high
 voltage space missions (300 V average, 600 V peak).Lightweight, highly
conductive power cables and\/or cables integrated with vehicle
structures, and nano-wiring for low power 28 V distribution.Intelligent
power management and fault-tolerant electrical components and PMAD
systems.Advanced electronic packaging for thermal control and
electromagnetic shielding.Integrated packaging technology for
modularity.Cubesat\/nanosat power systems up to 100 W.\u00a0Energy
Storage\u00a0Future science missions will require advanced primary and
secondary battery systems capable of operating at temperature extremes
from -100 \u00b0C for Titan missions to 400 to 500 \u00b0C for Venus
missions, and a span of -230 \u00b0C to +120 \u00b0C for Lunar Quest.
The Outer Planet Assessment Group and the 2011 PSD Relevant Technologies
 Document have specifically called out high energy density storage
systems as a need for the Titan\/Enceladus Flagship and planetary
exploration missions. In addition, high energy-density rechargeable
electrochemical battery systems that offer greater than 50,000
charge\/discharge cycles (10 year operating life) for low-earth-orbiting
 spacecraft, 20 year life for geosynchronous (GEO) spacecraft, are
desired. Advancements to battery energy storage capabilities that
address one or more of the above requirements for the stated missions
combined with very high specific energy and energy density (&gt;200
Wh\/kg for secondary battery systems), along with radiation tolerance
are of interest.In addition to batteries, other advanced energy
storage\/load leveling technologies designed to the above mission
requirements, such as mechanical or magnetic energy storage devices, are
 of interest. These technologies have the potential to minimize the size
 and mass of future power systems.\u00a0Research should be conducted to
demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a
 Phase II, and when possible, deliver a demonstration unit for NASA
testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase II emphasis
should be placed on developing and demonstrating the technology under
relevant test conditions. Additionally, a path should be outlined that
shows how the technology could be commercialized or further developed
into science-worthy systems.Patent 6,461,944, Methods for growth of

Center(s):JPLTerrestrial Balloons\u00a0NASAs Scientific Balloons provide
 practical and cost effective platforms for conducting discovery
science, development and testing for future space instruments, as well
as training opportunities for future scientists and engineers. Balloons
can reach altitudes above 36 kilometers, with suspended masses up to
3600 kilograms, and can stay afloat for several weeks. Currently, the
Balloon Program is on the verge of introducing an advanced balloon
system that will enable 100 day missions at mid-latitudes and thus
resemble the performance of a small spacecraft at a fraction of the
cost. In support of this development, NASA is seeking innovative
technologies in two key areas:\u00a0Power Storage\u00a0Improved and
innovative devices to store electrical energy onboard balloon payloads
are needed. Long duration balloon flights can experience 12 hours or
more of darkness, and excess electrical power generated during the day
from solar panels needs to be stored and used. Improvements are needed
over the current state of the art in power density, energy density,
overall size, overall mass and\/or cost. Typical parameters for balloon
are 28 VDC and 100 to 1000 watts power consumption. Rechargeable
batteries are presently used for balloon payload applications. Lithium
Ion rechargeable batteries with energy densities of 60 watt-hours per
kilogram are the current state of the art. Higher power storage energy
densities, and power generation capabilities of up to 2000 watts are
needed for future support.\u00a0Satellite Communications\u00a0Improved
and innovative downlink bitrates using satellite relay communications
from balloon payloads are needed. Long duration balloon flights
currently utilize satellite communication systems to relay science and
operations data from the balloon to ground based control centers. The
current maximum downlink bit rate is 150 kilobits per second operating
continuously during the balloon flight. Future requirements are for bit
rates of 1 megabit per second or more. Improvements in bit rate
performance, reduction in size and mass of existing systems, or
reductions in cost of high bit rate systems are needed. TDRSS and
Iridium satellite communications are currently used for balloon payload
applications. A commercial S-band TDRSS transceiver and mechanically
steered 18 dBi gain antenna provide 150 kbps continuous downlink. TDRSS
K-band transceivers are available but are currently cost prohibitive.
Open port Iridium service is under development, but the operational cost
 is prohibitive.\u00a0Planetary Balloons\u00a0Innovations in materials,
structures, and systems concepts have enabled buoyant vehicles to play
an expanding role in planning NASA's future Solar System Exploration
Program. Balloons are expected to carry scientific payloads at Titan and
 Venus that will perform in situ investigations of their atmospheres and
 near surface environments. Both Titan and Venus feature extreme
environments that significantly impact the design of balloons for those
two worlds. Proposals are sought in the following areas:\u00a0Power
Systems for Titan Balloons\u00a0NASA is interested in Titan balloons
that can fly at an altitude range of 5 to 10 km above the surface for at
 least 30 days. Innovative concepts are sought for power systems capable
 of providing 100 Watts of electric power continuously at 28 Volts for a
 30 day mission for a total electrical energy output of 72 kW-hrs. The
system must be capable of operating within the Titan environment at 85
to 95 K. The Titan atmosphere at this altitude range contains
approximately 95% nitrogen and 5% methane gas which may be harvested as
an in situ fuel source. Waste heat from the power source can be used to
keep the balloon payload at a warm operating temperature to reduce
electrical heating requirements. Consideration should also be given to
define requirements (e.g., power needs) placed on the host spacecraft
during the transit to Titan from Earth, which could be as long as 8
years, for storage and retention of the fuel and oxidizer components. It
 is expected that a Phase I effort will consist of a system-level design
 and a proof-of-concept experiment on one or more key components.
Proposers should include estimates of the mass and volume of their power
 system concept.Steerable Antenna for Titan and Venus
Telecommunications\u00a0Many concepts for Titan and Venus balloons
require high gain antennas mounted on the balloon gondola to transmit
data directly back to Earth. This approach requires that the antenna
remain mechanically or electronically pointed at the Earth despite the
motions experienced during balloon flight. A beacon signal from the
Earth will be available to facilitate pointing. Innovative concepts are
sought for such an antenna and pointing system with the following
characteristics: dish antenna diameter of 0.8 m (or equivalent non-dish
gain), total mass of antenna and pointing system of d 10 kg, power
consumption for the steering system d 5 W (avg.), pointing accuracy d
0.5 deg (continuous), hemispheric pointing coverage (2 pi steradians),
azimuthal and rotational slew rates \u00b3 30 deg\/sec. It is expected
that a Phase I effort will involve a proof-of-concept experiment leading
 to a plan for full scale prototype fabrication and testing in Phase II.
 Phase II testing will need to include an Earth atmosphere balloon
flight in the troposphere to evaluate the proposed design under real
flight conditions.",

Center(s):ARC,GRC,JPL,JSC,LaRC,MSFCFuture Spacecraft and instruments for
 NASA's Science Mission Directorate will require increasingly
sophisticated thermal control technology. Innovative proposals for the
cross-cutting thermal control discipline are sought in the following
areas:\u00a0Components of advanced small spacecraft such as
CubeSat\/SmallSat will have very small masses (i.e., small thermal
capacitance), and their temperatures are highly sensitive to variations
in the component power output and spacecraft environmental temperature.
Advanced thermal devices capable of maintaining components within their
specified temperature ranges are needed. Some examples are:Phase change
systems with high thermal capacity and minimal structural mass.High
performance, low cost insulation systems for diverse environments.High
flux heat acquisition and transport devices.Thermal coatings with low
absorptance, high emmittance, and good electrical conductivity.Current
capillary heat transfer devices require tedious processes to insert the
porous wick into the evaporator and to seal the wick ends for liquid and
 vapor separation. Advanced technology such as additive manufacturing is
 needed to simplify the processes and ensure good sealing at both ends
of the wick, especially for miniature thermal systems for
CubeSat\/SmallSat applications. Additive manufacturing technology can
also be used to produce integrated heat exchangers for pumped fluid
loops in order to increase heat transfer performance while significantly
 reducing mass, labor and cost.\u00a0Science missions are more dependent
 on optically sensitive instruments and systems, and effects of thermal
distortion on the performance of the system are critical. Current
Structural-Thermal-Optical (STOP) analysis has several codes that do
some form of integrated analysis, but none that have the capability to
analyze any optical system and do a full end-to-end analysis. An
improvement of existing code is needed in order to yield software that
is user-friendly, integrates with all commonly used programs at NASA for
 mechanical, structural, thermal and optical analysis, allows full STOP
analysis, changes performance predictions based on mechanical design
changes, structural or thermal materials or analysis changes, and
quickly predicts full system performance.Single-phased and two-phase
mechanically pumped fluid systems with easily adaptable\/reconfigurable
architectures are needed in order to accommodate multiple heat sources
and multiple heat sinks. In addition, missions with high sink
temperatures require vapor compression systems with COP &gt; 5 and high
temperature lifts. Such systems must accommodate long duration missions
(12+ years) in high radiation environments (e.g., Europa). Areas of
focus include high performance working fluids with wide temperature
ranges and low freeze points; novel evaporators\/heat exchangers that
promote isothermality over large areas; lightweight, reliable phase
separators; long-life, energy efficient pumps for sub-cooled systems;
long-life, energy efficient compressors for vapor compression systems;
and miniaturization of pumps, compressors, and control valves.Current
analysis for ablation analysis of re-entry vehicles utilizes various
computer codes for predicting the following individual phenomena:
aeroheating, ablation, thermal response behind the bond line, thermal
radiation, and structural response to thermal and pressure environments.
 The interfaces between each code lead to potential errors, inaccuracy,
and huge computer run time. What is needed is a single code that
evaluates the trajectory or input conditions, predicts aeroheating over
the surface, does an integrated ablation-thermal analysis, and then uses
 that thermal and pressure gradient to do a full structural analysis.
Even better would be a link back to the aeroheating prediction code to
revise the aeroheating based on shape change from structural analysis
and ablation.Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical
feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II hardware
demonstration. Phase II should deliver a demonstration unit for NASA
testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.\u00a0",

        "description": "Lead Center:MSFC\u00a0Steep dispersions in
engineered media of a wide variety have opened up a new direction of
research in optics. A positive dispersion can be used to slow the
propagation of optical pulses to extremely small velocities. Similarly, a
 negative dispersion can lead to conditions where pulses propagate
superluminally. These effects have now moved beyond the stage of
intellectual curiosity, and have ushered in studies of a set of exciting
 applications of interest to NASA, ranging from ultraprecise
superluminal gyroscopes to spectral interferometers having enhanced
resolving power.\u00a0This research subtopic seeks slow-light and\/or
fast-light enhanced sensors for space applications of interest to NASA
including:Superluminal gyroscopes and accelerometers (both passive and
active).Enhanced strain and displacement sensors for non-destructive
evaluation and integrated vehicle health management
applications.Slow-light-enhanced spectrally-resolved interferometers for
 astrophysical and Earth science observations, as well as for
exploration goals.Other applications of slow and fast light related to
NASA\u2019s mission areas.\u00a0Superluminal gyroscopes\u00a0In
conventional ring laser gyroscopes, sensitivity increases with cavity
size. Fast light, however, can be used to increase gyro sensitivity
without having to increase size, for spacecraft navigation systems which
 are constrained by weight and volume. The increased sensitivity also
opens up new science possibilities such as detection of subsurface
geological features, tests of Lorentz invariance, improving the
bandwidth sensitivity product for gravity wave detection, and tests of
general relativity. This research subtopic seeks:Prototype fast light
gyroscopes, active or passive, that unambiguously demonstrate a scale
factor enhancement of at least 10 with the potential for 1000. The
minimum or quantum-noise limited angular random walk (ARW) should also
decrease.Designs for fast light gyros that do not require frequency
locking, are not limited to operation at specific frequencies such as
atomic or material resonances, and permit operation at any
wavelength.Fast light gyroscope designs that are rugged, compact,
monolithic, rad-hard, and tolerant to variations in temperature and
varying G-conditions.\u00a0Slow-light enhanced spectral
interferometers\u00a0Slow light has the potential to increase the
resolving power of spectral interferometers such as Fourier transform
spectrometers (FTS) for astrophysical applications without increasing
their size. Mariner, Voyager, and Cassini all used FTS instruments for
applications such as mapping atmospheres and examining ring
compositions. The niche for FTS is usually thought to be for large
wavelength (IR and beyond), wide-field, moderate spectral resolution
instruments. Slow light, however, could help boost FTS spectral
resolution making FTS instruments more competitive with grating-based
instruments, and opening up application areas not previously thought to
be accessible to FTS instruments, such as exoplanet detection. A
slow-light FTS could also be hyper-spectral, providing imaging
capability. FTS instruments have been employed for remote sensing on
NASA Earth Science missions, such as the Atmospheric Trace Molecule
Spectroscopy (ATMOS), Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), and
Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) experiments, and have long been
 considered for geostationary imaging of atmospheric greenhouse gases.
This research subtopic seeks research and development of
slow-light-enhanced spectral interferometers that are not restricted by
material resonances and can operate at any wavelength. An inherent
advantage of FTS systems are their wide bandwidth. It will therefore of
importance to develop slow light FTS systems that can maintain a large
operating bandwidth.\u00a0",

Computing project at Goddard. To assure maximum relevance to NASA,
funded SBIR contracts under this subtopic should engage in direct
interactions with one or both HEC projects, and with key HEC users where
 appropriate. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical
feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a
Phase II prototype demonstration.\u00a0Offerors should demonstrate
awareness of the state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and
should leverage existing commercial capabilities and research efforts
where appropriate. Open source software and open standards are strongly
preferred. Note that the NASA supercomputing environment is
characterized by:\u00a0HEC systems operating behind a firewall to meet
strict IT security requirements.Communication-intensive
applications.Massive computations requiring high concurrency.Complex
computational workflows and immense datasets.The need to support
hundreds of complex application codes - many of which are frequently
updated by the user\/developer.\u00a0As a result, solutions that involve
 the following must clearly explain how they would work in the NASA
environment:\u00a0Grid computing.Web services.Client-server
models.Embarrassingly parallel computations.Technologies that require
significant application re-engineering.\u00a0Projects need not benefit
all NASA HEC users or application codes, but demonstrating applicability
 to an important NASA discipline, or even a key NASA application code,
could provide significant value.\u00a0Specific technology areas of
interest:Efficient Computing - In spite of the rapidly increasing
capability and efficiency of supercomputers, NASA's HEC facilities
cannot purchase, power, and cool sufficient HEC resources to satisfy all
 user demands. This subtopic element seeks dramatically more efficient
and effective supercomputing approaches in terms of their ability to
supply increased HEC capability or capacity per dollar and\/or per Watt
for real NASA applications. Examples include:Novel computational
accelerators and architectures.Cloud supercomputing with high
performance interconnects (e.g., InfiniBand).Enhanced visualization
technologies.Improved algorithms for key codes.Power-aware "Green"
computing technologies and techniques.Approaches to effectively manage
and utilize many-core processors including algorithmic changes, compiler
 techniques and runtime systems.User Productivity Environments - The
user interface to a supercomputer is typically a command line in a text
window. This subtopic element seeks more intuitive, intelligent,
user-customizable, and integrated interfaces to supercomputing
resources, enabling users to more completely leverage the power of HEC
to increase their productivity. Such an interface could enhance many
essential supercomputing tasks: accessing and managing resources,
training, getting services, developing and porting codes (e.g.,
debugging and performance analysis), running computations, managing
files and data, analyzing and visualizing results, transmitting data,
collaborating, etc.Ultra-Scale Computing - Over the next decade, the HEC
 community faces great challenges in enabling its users to effectively
exploit next-generation supercomputers featuring massive concurrency to
the tune of millions of cores. To overcome these challenges, this
subtopic element seeks ultra-scale computing technologies that enable
resiliency\/fault-tolerance in extreme-scale (unreliable) systems both
at job startup and during execution. Also of interest are system and
software co-design methodologies, to achieve performance and efficiency
synergies. Finally, tools are sought that facilitate verification and
validation of ultra-scale applications and systems.\u00a0",

(http:\/\/nasascience.nasa.gov\/earth-science\/applied-sciences) seeks
innovative and unique approaches to increase the utilization and extend
the benefit of Earth Science research data to better meet societal
needs. One area of interest is new decision support tools and systems
for a variety of ecological applications such as managing coastal
environments, natural resources or responding to natural
disasters.\u00a0Currently, creating decision support tools (DST) that
effectively utilize remote sensing data requires significant efforts by
experts in multiple domains. This creates a barrier to the widespread
use of Earth observations by state and local governments, businesses,
and the public. This subtopic aims to democratize the creation of Earth
science driven decision support tools and to unleash a creative
explosion of DST development that significantly increases the return on
investment for Earth science missions.Specifically, this subtopic
develops core capabilities that can be integrated to build multiple
remote sensing driven DSTs customized to the requirements of different
users in varied fields. Proven development and commercialization
strategies will be used to meet these objectives. Similar to Eclipse,
this subtopic will create an open-source DST development framework that
enables components from multiple providers to be seamlessly integrated.
This subtopic will also create software components that plug into the
framework and open source tools that help users create new components.
The components will provide functionality ranging from basic operations,
 such as retrieval of data meeting user-specified criteria from online
repositories and visualization, to sophisticated data processing and
analysis algorithms, such as atmospheric correction, data fusion,
computational model interfaces, and machine learning based quality
control.\u00a0To expedite DST development and deployment by
knowledgeable users, this subtopic seeks an open source graphical
workflow tool, similar to Labview or Simulink, which enables well
informed users to quickly create a functional DST from a catalog of
software components. Ultimately, a more sophisticated graphical workflow
 development tool, similar to MIT's Scratch would enforce functionally,
but not necessarily logically, "correct by construction" rules that
would enable a broad population of people to successfully create DSTs.
Open source and commercial components, as well as services, will be
available through an online "store" similar to iTunes or Google Play.The
 framework, components and resulting DSTs should be able to run in a
commercial cloud such as Amazon EC2 or Google Compute Engine. Cloud
enabled components and DSTs, those that can intelligently take advantage
 of flexible computing resources for processing, analysis,
visualization, optimization, etc. are highly desired.\u00a0Ideally,
users should be able to create, configure deploy DSTs, and view outputs
such as status, reports, alerts, plots, maps, etc. via desktop computers
 (Windows 7 and OS X) as well as tablet and smart phones running recent
versions of Android (4.0 and later) and iOS (5.0 and later). An HTML5
web application in a standards compliant browser, such as Chrome, can
provide the required level of interoperability and capability. Due to
serious security issues, Java and Flash based approaches will not be
considered.\u00a0\u00a0",

Center(s):LaRC,MSFC,KSC,ARC,SSC,JPLThe size of NASA's observational data
 sets is growing dramatically as new missions come on line. In addition,
 NASA scientists continue to generate new models that regularly produce
data sets of hundreds of terabytes or more. It is growing ever
increasingly difficult to manage all of the data through its full
lifecycle, as well as provide effective data analytical methods to
analyze the large amount of data.\u00a0Using remote observation
examples, the HyspIRI mission is expected to produce an average science
data rate of 800 million bits per second (Mbps), JPSS-1 will be 300 Mbps
 and NPP is already producing 300 Mbps, compared to 150 Mbps for the
EOS-Terra, Aqua and Aura missions. Other examples are SDO with a rate of
 150 Mbps and 16.4 Gigabits for a single image from the HiRise camera on
 the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). From the NASA climate models,
the MERRA reanalysis data set is approximately 200 TB, and MERRA2 will
start generating even more data late in 2014.This subtopic area seeks
innovation and unique approaches to solve issues associated around the
use of "Big Data" within NASA. The emphasis of this subtopic is on tools
 that leverage existing systems, interfaces, and infrastructure, where
it exists and where appropriate. Reuse of existing NASA assets is
strongly encouraged.\u00a0Specifically, innovations are being sought in
the following areas:\u00a0Parallel Processing for Data Analytics - Open
source tools like the Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) have shown
promise for use in simple MapReduce operations to analyze model and
observation data. In addition to HDFS, there is a rapid emergence of an
ecosystem of tools associated with high performance data analytics using
 cloud software packages, such as Hive, Impala, Spark, etc. The goal is
to accelerate these types of open source tools for use with binary
structured data from observations and model output using MapReduce or a
similar paradigm.High Performance File System Abstractions - NASA
scientists currently use a large number of existing applications for
data analysis, such as GrADS, python scripts, and more, that are not
compatible with an object storage environment. If data were stored
within an object storage environment, these applications would not be
able to access the data. Many of these applications would require a
substantial amount of investment to enable them to use object storage
file systems. Therefore, a file system abstraction, such as FUSE (file
system in user space) is needed to facilitate the use of existing data
analysis applications with an object storage environment. The goal is to
 make a FUSE-like file system abstraction robust, reliable, and highly
performing for use with large NASA data sets.Data Management of
Large-Scale Scientific Repositories - With increasing size of scientific
 repositories comes an increasing demand for using the data in ways that
 may never have been imagined when the repository was conceived. The
goal is to provide capabilities for the flexible repurposing of
scientific data, including large-scale data integration, aggregation,
representation, and distribution to emerging user communities and
applications.Server Side Data Processing - Large data repositories make
it necessary for analytical codes to migrate to where the data are
stored. In a densely networked world of geographically distributed
repositories, tiered intermediation is needed. The goal is to provide
support for migratable codes and analytical outputs as first class
objects within a provenance-oriented data management
cyberinfrastructure.Techniques for Data Analysis and Visualization - New
 methods for data analytics that scale to extremely large and
geographically distributed data sets are necessary for data mining,
searching, fusion, subsetting, discovery, visualization, and more. In
addition, new algorithms and methods are needed to look for unknown
correlations across large, distributed scientific data sets. The goal is
 to increase the scientific value of model and observation data by
making analysis easier and higher performing. Among others, some of the
topics of interest are:Techniques for automated derivation of analysis
products such as machine learning for extraction of features in large
image datasets (e.g., volcanic thermal measurement, plume measurement,
automated flood mapping, disturbance mapping, change detection,
etc.).Workflows for automated data processing, interpretation, and
distribution.\u00a0Research proposed to this subtopic should demonstrate
 technical feasibility during Phase I, and in partnership with
scientists, show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration, with
significant communication with missions and programs to ensure a
successful Phase III infusion. It is highly desirable that the proposed
projects lead to software that is infused into NASA programs and
projects.\u00a0Tools and products developed under this subtopic may be
used for broad public dissemination or within a narrow scientific
community. These tools can be plug-ins or enhancements to existing
software, on-line data\/computing services, or new stand-alone
applications or web services, provided that they promote
interoperability and use standard protocols, file formats and
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or prevalent
applications.\u00a0",

        "description": "Lead Center:ARCParticipating
Center(s):MSFC,JPLAs science missions are given increasingly complex
goals and have more pressure to reduce operations costs, system autonomy
 increases. Fault Management (FM) is one of the key components of system
 autonomy. FM consists of the operational mitigations of spacecraft
failures. It is implemented with spacecraft hardware, on-board
autonomous software that controls hardware, software, information
redundancy, and ground-based software and operations
procedures.\u00a0Many recent Science Mission Directorate (SMD) missions
have encountered major cost overruns and schedule slips during test and
verification of FM functions. These overruns are due to a lack of
understanding of FM functions early in the mission definition cycles and
 to FM architectures that do not provide attributes of transparency,
verifiability, fault isolation capability, or fault coverage. The NASA
FM Handbook is under development to improve the FM design, development,
verification and validation and operations processes. FM approaches,
architectures, and tools are needed to improve early understanding of
needed FM capabilities by project managers and FM engineers and to
improve the efficiency of implementing and testing FM.Specific
objectives are to:\u00a0Improve the ability to predict FM system
complexity and estimate development and operations costs.Enable
cost-effective FM design architectures and operations.Determine
completeness and appropriateness of FM designs and
implementations.Decrease the labor and time required to develop and test
 FM models and algorithms.Improve visualization of the full FM design
across hardware, software, and operations procedures.Determine extent of
 testing required, completeness of verification planned, and residual
risk resulting from incomplete coverage.Increase data integrity between
multi-discipline tools.Standardize metrics and calculations across FM,
SE, S&amp;MA and operations disciplines.Increase reliability of FM
systems.\u00a0Expected outcomes are better estimation and control of FM
complexity and development costs, improved FM designs, and accelerated
advancement of FM tools and techniques.\u00a0The approach of this
subtopic is to seek the right balance between sufficient reliability and
 cost appropriate to the mission type and risk posture. Successful
technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered
for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, SMD missions. Research
should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA
relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II prototype
demonstration.\u00a0Offerors should demonstrate awareness of the
state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage
existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where
appropriate.\u00a0Specific technology in the forms listed below is
needed to increase delivery of high quality FM systems. These
approaches, architectures and tools must be consistent with and enable
the NASA FM Handbook concepts and processes:\u00a0FM Design Tools -
System modeling and analyses significantly contributes to the quality of
 FM design; however, the time it takes to translate system design
information into system models often decreases the value of the modeling
 and analysis results. Examples of enabling techniques and tools are
modeling automation, spacecraft modeling libraries, expedited algorithm
development, sensor placement analyses, and system model tool
integration.FM Visualization Tools - FM systems incorporate hardware,
software, and operations mechanisms. The ability to visualize the full
FM system and the contribution of each mechanism to protecting mission
functions and assets is critical to assessing the completeness and
appropriateness of the FM design to the mission attributes (mission
type, risk posture, operations concept, etc.). Fault trees and state
transition diagrams are examples of visualization tools that could
contribute to visualization of the full FM design.FM Verification and
Validation Tools - As complexity of spacecraft and systems increases,
the extensiveness of testing required to verify and validate FM
implementations can be resource intensive. Automated test case
development, false positive\/false negative test tools, model
verification and validation tools, and test coverage risk assessments
are examples of contributing technologies.FM Design Architectures - FM
capabilities may be implemented through numerous system, hardware, and
software architecture solutions. The FM architecture trade space
includes options such as embedded in the flight control software or
independent onboard software; on board versus ground-based capabilities;
 centralized or distributed FM functions; sensor suite implications;
integration of multiple FM techniques; innovative software FM
architectures implemented on flight processors or on Field Programmable
Gate Arrays (FPGAs); and execution in real-time or off-line analysis
post-operations. Alternative architecture choices such as model-based
approaches could help control FM system complexity and cost and could
offer solutions to transparency, verifiability, and completeness
challenges.Multi-discipline FM Interoperation - FM designers, Systems
Engineering, Safety and Mission Assurance, and Operations perform
analyses and assessments of reliabilities, failure modes and effects,
sensor coverage, failure probabilities, anomaly detection and response,
contingency operations, etc. The relationships between multi-discipline
data and analyses are inconsistent and misinterpreted. Resources are
expended either in effort to resolve disconnects in data and analyses or
 worse, reduced mission success due to failure modes that were
overlooked. Solutions that address data integrity, identification of
metrics, and standardization of data products, techniques and analyses
will reduce cost and failures.\u00a0",

capabilities beyond what can be easily supported using solar arrays or
chemical fuel cells. Thermal-to-Electric materials and systems working
in conjunction with nuclear systems have the potential to serve this
need and to operate at distances from the Sun well beyond the limit of
its useful energy. Existing Thermal-to-Electric materials and systems do
 not \u201ctrade well\u201d with existing power generation options,
e.g., fuel cells, due to poor efficiency and specific power, however
their longevity of operation makes them attractive for many other
mission spaces. In the last decade extensive research has gone into
raising the figure of merit for thermoelectric materials, ZT, both new
materials and new fabrication techniques that modify the morphology and
atomic lattice of the materials, have been attempted with varying
degrees of success. Simultaneously, work has been done on creating
\u201ccoupled\u201d systems similar to multi-junction solar arrays that
produce greater efficiency than single layer systems. Although this
research has resulted in significant advances at the basic materials
level, these advances have yet to be transitioned to NASA RTGs. In fact
the Mars Curiosity MMRTG utilized the same TE materials and reported the
 same system level performance, i.e., efficiency and specific power, as
the SNAP 19 RTG launched in 1972 for Pioneer 10. Thermionic power
conversion is a complimentary static approach which could extend power
conversion efficiencies beyond thermoelectric limits to as high as 25%
or more. Successful thermionic converters would enable power systems
with the efficiency of dynamic systems (Rankine, Brayton and Stirling),
but with no moving parts and the potential for high reliability. High
waste heat rejection temperatures also lead to modest radiator area and
mass. Thermionic converters received much attention in the 1960's-90's
for solar and nuclear power, and were flown in space by the Russians in
the 1990's. At the time, high-temperature low-work-function materials,
precise gap maintenance, and space charge buildup proved problematic for
 the then state-of-art. Since the year 2000, major advances have been
made in the highly relevant fields of nanotechnology, nanomaterials,

 will enable or enhance the capabilities of future science and human
exploration missions. Requirements for these missions are varied and
include long life, high reliability, significantly lower mass and
volume, higher mass specific power, and improved efficiency over the
state of practice for components and systems. Other desired capabilities

lower cost and scalability of the material and structural systems that
will be critical to NASA\u0092s space exploration and missions.  As NASA
 strives to explore deeper into space than ever before, improvements in
all of these areas will be critical.  For example, mass reduction is an
ever-present goal in the development of space exploration systems.
Reductions in structural mass can either enable additional payload to be
 launched to orbit or reduce the mass of the payload that must be
returned to Earth or landed on another planetary surface.  Application
areas for the material, structural, and manufacturing\/assembly
technologies developed under this SBIR topic include launch and crew
vehicles, in-space transportation elements, habitation and crew-transfer
 systems, surface systems, and other systems used for space exploration.
  \n\nSince this topic area has a broad range of interest, subtopics are
 selected by the Space Technology Mission Directorate to enhance and\/or
 fill gaps in the exploration technology development programs and to
complement other mission directorate topic areas.  Advances in
composite, metallic, and ceramic material systems are of interest in
this topic, as are advances in the associated manufacturing methods for
these various material systems.  Significant advances can be realized by
 improvements in material formulation through improvements in the
capabilities to manufacture and assemble large-scale structural
components.  Therefore, subtopics of interest will include but will not
be limited to nanomaterial and nanostructures development, advanced
metallic materials and processes development, and large-scale polymer
matrix composite structures, materials, and manufacturing technologies.
 Other sub-topic areas may be added as required to address specific
agency needs.\n\nThe subtopic of interest for FY15 addresses large-scale
 polymer matrix composite (PMC) structures and materials, and
concentrates on developing lightweight structures using advanced
materials technologies and new manufacturing processes.  Out of
autoclave material systems and processing as well as joining
technologies to enable 5 \u0096 9 m diameter composite structures will
be of interest. The specific needs and metrics of this focus area is
described in the subtopic description.\n\nResearch awarded under this
topic should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility (proof of
 concept) during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II hardware
demonstration, and when possible, deliver a full-scale demonstration
unit for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the
Phase II

innovative technologies for components and subsystems for small
spacecraft ranging in size from cubesat-scale up to spacecraft of
approximately 100 kilograms in mass. These spacecraft are intended for
science, exploration, and other missions in Earth orbit and, in
particular, for operations in other regions of the inner solar system
beyond Earth.\u00a0For all technology areas outlined below, the
components and subsystems must be tolerant of typical launch vehicle
loads and environments and operationally tolerant of the thermal and
radiation environment that exists, as a minimum, in earth orbit at any
altitude above 300 km, in cis-lunar space including lunar orbit, and in
heliocentric orbit at 1 Astronomical Unit (AU) from the sun. It is
desirable that these components and subsystems also be operationally
tolerant of the thermal and radiation environment that exists in
interplanetary space ranging from 0.7 AU to at least to 3 AU from the
sun and in orbit around Mars and Venus. Components and subsystems must
also be resistant to the atomic oxygen environment in low-Earth
orbit.\u00a0For all technology areas below, proposals are sought for
projects that can produce, by the end of Phase II, flight-quality
hardware or at least proto-flight hardware for the designated components
 or subsystems that might then be integrated into spacecraft for
technology demonstration flights, initially in low-Earth orbit. Initial
flight demonstrations are likely to employ 3-unit or 6-unit cubesat
spacecraft. For convenience in integration, components and subsystems
should be designed to fit a standard cubesat unit (10 by 10 by 10
centimeters), a fraction of that unit, or multiples of that unit. The
desired Phase I deliverables include a detailed description and plan for
 development and fabrication of the hardware to be produced by the end
of Phase II.\u00a0Proposals are sought in several technology areas
outlined below. Proposers should clearly state the technology area
addressed by their proposal. Proposers may submit more than one proposal
 but each individual proposal must address only one of the technology
areas below.\u00a0Power Systems for Small Spacecraft\u00a0This area
seeks innovative technologies for solar power generation and\/or
electrical energy storage systems for small spacecraft ranging in size
from cubesat-scale up to spacecraft of approximately 100 kilograms in
mass. The primary power requirement is for electric propulsion systems
although these spacecraft might also utilize significant electrical
power for communications and payload operations.\u00a0Solar Array
Systems: Solar array systems consisting of deployable panels or blankets
 with necessary structural support, mechanisms, and functional
photovoltaic cell arrays. The arrays must be designed for unaided
deployment in the space environment (micro-gravity and vacuum
conditions) and provide for functional power generation. Innovations are
 sought in compact packaging of arrays for launch, reliable array
deployment at a specified time after launch, and reliable power
generation in space. Systems with low mass are desired but compact
storage volume is the more important feature. The power generation goal
for these systems is 100 to 500 watts per panel (power at beginning of
life at 1 AU from the sun) for panels that can be packaged for launch
within a volume of three cubesat units (3U) or less. Systems are sought
which also incorporate the capability for rotation relative to the body
of the spacecraft to allow the array to track the sun as the spacecraft
moves through space.Energy Storage Systems: Batteries or other types of
rechargeable energy storage systems with a capacity of 200 to 2000
watt-hours and with minimum volume and mass. Functional heat rejection
requirements must also be addressed in the design and prototype
hardware.Integrated Power Systems: Systems that include the solar array

spacecraft.\u00a0Navigation and Attitude Determination for Small
Spacecraft beyond Earth Orbit\u00a0This area seeks innovative
technologies for navigation and attitude determination systems for small
 spacecraft ranging in size from cubesat-scale up to spacecraft of
approximately 100 kilograms in mass, operating beyond low-Earth orbit.
The relevant systems are required to provide precise knowledge of the
spacecraft state (position, attitude, and rates in all axes) without
reliance on the Global Positioning System or similar Earth-orbit
references or planetary magnetic fields. Any reliance on Earth based
communications and tracking systems must take into account the limited
power and other capabilities of small spacecraft operating at great
distances from Earth. Novel concepts that minimize reliance on
conventional navigation and tracking resources and techniques are
desired.The relevant navigation systems must be scaled for integration
in small spacecraft with a target peak-power requirement of less than
100 watts and a volume of less than 3 cubesat units (approximately 10 by
 10 by 30 centimeters) for the system. Lower volume, mass, and power
usage is desirable. Requirements for heat rejection from the navigation
system must be addressed in the design.\u00a0Structures for Small
Spacecraft\u00a0This area seeks innovative technologies for structural
designs for small spacecraft ranging in size from cubesat-scale up to
spacecraft of approximately 100 kilograms in mass, for operation in and
beyond Earth orbit. Structures for cubesats in the 3U, 6U and 12U size
range are of particular interest. Proposed concepts should offer
significant advantages over conventional aluminum or composite
structures in one or more of the following ways:\u00a0Reduce mass while
maintaining adequate strength.Provide thermal management features for
the spacecraft such as enhanced heat transfer and heat rejection.Provide
 radiation shielding to other spacecraft components.Enhance the ease of
assembly and integration of spacecraft.\u00a0The recurring cost of the
structures and materials proposed should be consistent with the low-cost
 goals of small spacecraft projects.\u00a0Proposals must focus on the
design and fabrication of flight-quality or at least proto-flight
structures that might then be integrated into small spacecraft for

water recovery and storage. Traditionally collection and processing are
treated as discrete systems that require significant crew interactions
and equipment\/consumables to allow water recovery. Future space craft
will have limited volume and management of human and life support wastes
 must be improved. Waste management gaps exist in processing fecal
waste, trash, hygiene waste, and residual urine brines (85% of water
removed). Future waste systems should utilize features that do not
require dynamic liquid separation, are highly tolerant of precipitation
and solids accumulation, have limited crew interaction, and minimize off
 gassed compounds during processing or storage. Processing technologies
should recover thermal energy where feasible and be able to operate with
 irregular time intervals or long quiescent periods between waste
inputs. Waste management components and systems are desired to enhance,
improve, or integrate existing HEOMD and STMD technologies such as the
Universal Waste Management System (toilet), Heat Melt Compactor (solid
waste processor that can heat compact and provide water recovery), Urine
 Processing Systems (Cascade Distillation, Vapor Compression
Distillation), and Brine processors. Proposals in the following key
technologies are requested.Human Solid Waste Management Human fecal
waste (mixed solid, diarrheal, wipes, and hygiene products) is currently
 entrained with air and collected into bags which are stored in rigid
containers. The rigid containers require significant logistical volume
and do not allow water recovery. There is a need for collection bags and
 containers that require minimal crew manipulation and allow or
facilitate the recovery of water from the mixed solid waste. The bag,
container, and processing components must allow recovery of greater than
 90% of the water, control odors, and prevent microbial releases beyond
the container during and after processing. Specific challenges include
components for urine and fecal odor control, water condensation and
separation of high organic\/high microbial population fluids, and
minimal consumable mass per defecation. Commonality or capability to
process mixed non-human solid waste or brine waste is desirable but not
required.Water Recovery from Brine Brine is currently produced as the
concentrate from distillation of urine and humidity condensate. Future
mission wastewater could include hygiene and laundry sources. Brines may
 contain about 15% dissolved solids at a pH of about 2 with hazardous
treatment chemicals such as oxone, sulfuric acid, and chromic acid,
depending on pretreatment chemicals used. Processes are desired that can
 recover roughly 90% of the residual water from the brine while
containing the hazardous brine residual and avoiding risk of residual
release to the cabin.Phase I Deliverables - Detailed analysis, proof of
concept test data, and predicted performance. Deliverables should
clearly describe and predict how performance of targeted spacecraft and
commercial systems are enhanced, improved, or integrated with the
proposed technology.Phase II Deliverables - Delivery of technologically
mature components\/subsystems that demonstrate physical processes are
required. For NASA applications, near flight-like configuration is
requested. Hardware designs should allow integration to or with the
above NASA systems, compatible with resources from an EXPRESS rack or
similar ISS facility. Systems requiring resources significantly beyond
the capability of and ISS EXPRESS rack are not desired without clear
identification of a significant performance benefit. Although suitable
for commercial applications, delivery of a standalone ground-based
Benchtop subsystem would not be appropriate for flight applications
unless justified.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

 component level technologies (TRL4) to demonstrated system level
technologies (TRL6) by using them to manufacture complete telescope
systems which will fly on a high-altitude balloon or sub-orbital rocket
mission. Examples of desired technological advances relative to the
current state of the art include, but are not limited to:\u00a0Reduce
the areal cost of telescope by 2X to 4X such that larger collecting
areas can be produced for the same cost or current collecting areas can
be produced for half the cost.Reduce the areal density of telescopes by
2X to 4X such that the same aperture telescopes have half the mass of
current state of art telescope (less mass enables longer duration
flights) for no increase in cost.Improve thermal\/mechanical wavefront
stability and\/or pointing stability by 2X to 10X.Technological
maturation will be demonstrated by building one or more complete
telescope assemblies which can be flown on potential long duration
balloon or sub-orbital rocket experiments to do high priority science.
While proposals will be accepted for potential missions that cover any

completely assembled and tested telescope assembly ready to be
integrated into a potential balloon or sub-orbital rocket mission
payload. For a potential balloon mission, the telescopes must be
designed to survive 150K to 330K temperature range and 10G shock. For a
potential sub-orbital rocket mission, the telescope must be designed to
survive nominal temperature range and nominal shock. The mass budgets
for each telescope are nominal. Testing shall confirm compliance of the
telescope assembly with its requirements.Please note: all offerors are
highly encouraged to team with a potential user for their telescope and
include that individual in their proposal as a science mission
co-investigator.NASA Relevance The 2010 National Academy Astro2010
Decadal Report recommended increased use of sub-orbital balloon-borne
observatories. Two specific needs include:\u00a0Far-IR telescope systems
 for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) studies.Optical\/NIR telescope
systems for Dark Matter and\/or Exo-Planet studies.Additionally,
Astro2010 identifies optical components as key technologies needed to
enable several different future missions, including:\u00a0Light-weight
x-ray imaging mirrors for future very large advanced x-ray
observatories.Large aperture, light-weight mirrors for future
UV\/Optical telescopes.\u00a0The 2012 National Academy report \u201cNASA
 Space Technology Roadmaps and Priorities\u201d states that one of the
top technical challenges in which NASA should invest over the next 5
years is developing a new generation of larger effective aperture,
lower-cost astronomical telescopes that enable discovery of habitable
planets, facilitate advances in solar physics, and enable the study of
faint structures around bright objects. To enable this capability
requires low-cost, ultra-stable, large-aperture, normal and grazing
incidence mirrors with low mass-to-collecting area ratios. To enable
these new astronomical telescopes, the report identifies three specific
optical systems technologies:\u00a0Active align\/control of
grazing-incidence imaging systems to achieve &lt; 1 arc-second angular
resolution.Active align\/control of normal-incidence imaging systems to
achieve 500 nm diffraction limit (40 nm rms wavefront error, WFE)
performance.Normal incidence 4-meter (or larger) diameter 5 nm rms WFE
(300 nm system diffraction limit) mirrors.Technical Challenges
Scientists continue to develop new, more sophisticated experiments for
flight on high-altitude balloons and sub-orbital rockets. These include
new large single aperture telescopes and interferometers. These
experiments require large, light weight, low cost optics, with
well-behaved properties over a wide temperature range. For experiments
in the infrared, there are currently several material options available,
 including glass, aluminum, and carbon fiber. Each of these has both
advantages and disadvantages. Glass mirrors have a long heritage, and
are generally relatively cost effective. Unfortunately, they also tend
to be fairly massive without sophisticated light-weighting, which
significantly raises cost. Aluminum mirrors are suitable for
long-wavelength applications, and have the major advantage that
all-aluminum structures holding the optics provide good thermal
behavior. The disadvantage is that it is difficult to produce the very
accurate optical figure with low surface roughness, such as needed for
interferometers and for experiments in the ultraviolet, optical, and
near-infrared. As with glass mirrors, this problem can be solved by
increasing cost. Carbon fiber mirrors can provide both the mirror
quality and lightweight, but typically are still very expensive for
large mirrors such as those needed for future balloon experiments. All
of the above options have been used for balloon experiments, but
increasing aperture sizes, and the need for multiple large optics for
interferometers, is driving up the total cost of optics, such that
~10-20% of a new balloon budget can be spent on optics. Thus, new
methods or materials for producing such optics at lower cost are
needed.Ultra-Stable 1-meter Class UVOIR Telescope Multiple potential
balloon missions to perform Astrophysics, Exoplanet and Planetary
science investigations require a complete optical telescope system with 1
 meter or larger of collecting aperture. 1-m class balloon-borne
telescopes have flown successfully, however, the cost for design and
contraction of such telescopes can exceed $6M, and the weight of these
telescopes limits the scientific payload and duration of the balloon
mission. A 4X reduction in cost and mass would enable missions which
today are not feasible.Exoplanet Mission Telescope A potential exoplanet
 mission seeks a 1-m class wide-field telescope with diffraction-limited
 performance in the visible and a field of view &gt; 0.5 degree. The
telescope will operate over a temperature range of +10 to -70 C at an
altitude of 35 km. It must survive temperatures as low as -80 C during
ascent. The telescope should weigh less than 150 kg and is required to
maintain diffraction-limited performance over:\u00a0The entire
temperature range.Pitch range from 25 to 55 degrees elevation.Azimuth
range of 0 to 360 degrees.Roll range of \u201310 to +10 degrees.The
telescope will be used in conjunction with an existing high-performance
pointing stabilization system.Planetary Mission Telescope A potential
planetary balloon mission requires an optical telescope system with at
least 1-meter aperture for UV, visible, near- and mid-IR imaging and

tools.Maximum mass of any sub-assembly &lt; 90 kg.Largest sub-assembly
must pass through rectangular opening 56 by 50 inches (1.42 by 1.27

interferometry mission requires 0.5 meter class telescopes with
siderostat steering flat mirror. There are several technologies which
can be used for production of mirrors for balloon projects (aluminum,
carbon fiber, glass, etc.), but they are high mass and high cost.Balloon

seeks a gondola that can interface with a stratospheric balloon (such as
 one provided by CSBF). The gondola shall be able to operate for at
least 24hrs at a float altitude of at least 35Km; and 3-5hrs during the
ascent from ground to altitude. It must be able to point a 1 m class

specific target and stabilize it along its three axes to 2 arc-seconds
or better on each axis (1 sigma). The pointing accuracy shall be 1\/2
deg or better during the day and 1 arc minute or better during the night

elevation, the azimuth range of is 0 to 360 deg, and the roll range of
motion is \u201310 to +10 deg. The gondola maximum weight shall be 700

opportunity is to engage small business concerns (SBC) in developing
technologies and products that engage, empower, and motivate individuals
 and communities, including providers and healthcare institutions, in
sustainable health promoting activities and interventions that lead to
improved health, healthcare delivery, and the elimination of health
disparities. Healthy People 2020 defines a health disparity as a
particular type of health difference in the incidence, prevalence,
morbidity, and burden of diseases and other adverse health outcomes that
 is closely linked with social, economic, and\/or environmental
disadvantage. NIH defined health disparity population groups include
racial\/ethnic minorities (African Americans, American Indians, Alaska
Natives, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and
other U.S. Pacific Islanders), socioeconomically disadvantaged
individuals, and individuals residing in rural areas. Appropriate
technologies must be effective, affordable, culturally acceptable, and
easily accessible to those who need them. This announcement is expected
to reduce health disparities within and across the priority areas of
cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, HIV\/AIDS, infant
mortality, mental health, and obesity, as well as lung, liver, and
kidney diseases, psoriasis, scleroderma, and other diseases, illnesses,
and conditions of public health importance.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tOver
the years, there has been continued improvement of health for all
Americans with the introduction of medical and scientific advances. In
spite of notable improvements gained as a result of the technological
advancement, there continues to be an alarming disproportionate burden
of illness among minority and other health disparity populations.
Overcoming persistent disparities in healthcare access and health
outcomes remains a foremost challenge. To meet this challenge, the NIMHD
 is committed to support a wide range of research, aimed at the
development of innovative diagnostics, treatments, and preventative
strategies to reduce, and eventually eliminate health
disparities.\n\n\tResearch Objectives and Scope\n\n\tNIMHD is committed
to supporting a wide range of research aimed at the development of
innovative diagnostics, treatments, and preventative strategies and
making these products available and accessible to those individuals and
communities bearing disproportionate burdens of illness. Technologies to
 address the unique challenges encountered in rural areas are of
particular interest.\n\n\tTechnologies to be developed may be new and
innovative or they may arise from existing technologies that by redesign
 create increased and more attractive opportunities for health disparity
 populations to experience better health, improve their current health,
and to maintain a long and healthy lifestyle. Empowering technologies
are attractive, accessible easy to use, adoptable, and sustainable. To
be effective, a technology must provide users improvements in health
status and well-being relative to their current health status and
well-being. The technology should be reliable, robust, and have
reproducible outcomes. Ideally, the proposed technology should improve
health through increased opportunities for enhanced access
to:\n\n\t\n\t\tHealthcare institutions and providers, including those in
 geographically remote or physically difficult to access
locations;\n\n\n\t\n\t\tNew or increased patient populations especially,

        "description": "\n\tOBJECTIVE: Develop, prototype, and
demonstrate a low-cost electronic reusable and\/or disposable,
tamper-proof cargo container\/conveyance bolt seal for the maritime and
air cargo environments.\n\n\tDESCRIPTION: The current generation of bolt
 seals, despite being ISO-17712-2013 compliant, provides only limited
protection from tampering and illicit entry into the container or
conveyance. They can be defeated to gain access to the container or
conveyance through removal and replacement, and disassembly and
reassembly among other methodologies. Entries may be for the purpose of
removing goods or merchandise but, they also present an opportunity for
insertion of contraband (i.e., drugs, bulk currency, weapons, etc.),
weapons of mass effect, as well as illegal aliens.\n\tA number of more
sophisticated and more secure devices have been developed and are
available to industry as well as Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and
 Transportation Security Administration (TSA). While such units are very
 secure, they are also more costly and can be difficult to use. Except
for compliance factors under the C-TPAT and FAST programs, the use of
these devices are not mandatory to the industry, and as such, industry
is reluctant to use these devices except in the case of highly valued
and expensive merchandise. Meanwhile containers carrying more mundane
cargo are essentially unprotected. This SBIR topic seeks a solution that
 would ensure the integrity of the container and its cargo between
segments of the supply chain such as, for example, between a freight
consolidator and an air cargo facility subject to the requirements as
established below. The bolt seal must have unique non-duplicable
features such that it cannot be replaced, must not in any way or in any
form be reassembled after disassembly and removal, and must not allow
tampering in any manner. The electronics of such device may have GPS and
 time keeping capability and, if so equipped, may store location and
time of a tamper event in non-volatile memory. The memory may be queried
 by a relocatable device and\/or by a handheld device such as a smart
phone. The vendor shall propose schema whereby a point of departure
interrogation system shall relay presence of a seal and identification
of such to the receiving facility. However, under no circumstances shall
 the actions described herein increase the time, effort, or workload on
CBP or TSA Officers using the seals. In addition, the seals shall be
designed so that they can be mass produced.\n\tThis SBIR topic
description seeks proposals to prototype and test, in a field
environment, an innovative, low-cost (i.e., &amp;le;$15.00 each),
electronic disposable and\/or reusable tamper-proof cargo
container\/conveyance bolt seal.\n\n\tPHASE I: Develop conceptual
designs for the bolt seal and determine the technical feasibility and
potential for transition to high-speed bulk manufacturing for each
concept. A final report on the above is required at the conclusion of
the Phase I period.\n\n\tPHASE II: Phase II will develop one (1) or more
 low-cost prototype(s), electronic disposable and\/or reusable
tamper-proof cargo container\/conveyance bolt seals for internal
(Contractor) testing. Upon successful completion of internal testing,
the Contractor shall deliver to the Government no less than six (6)
prototypes including any support or ancillary equipment for external
testing by the Government with assistance from the Contractor. These
prototypes shall be delivered not later than seven (7) months prior to
the end of Phase II period of performance to allow for six (6) months
testing and one (1) month for analysis and final report development. The
 final report is to include, at a minimum, external test results (with
Government assistance); disposable and\/or reusable bolt seal business
case; and, a definitive plan to transition to full scale
production.\n\n\tPHASE III: COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS: This

        "topic_name": "Enhanced Distributed Denial of Service Defense",
        "description": "\n\tOBJECTIVE: Develop tools, techniques, and
polices that mitigate the impact of distributed denial of service (DDoS)
 attacks.\n\n\tDESCRIPTION: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
 are used to render key resources unavailable. For example, a classic
DDoS attack might disturb a financial institution&amp;rsquo;s website,
and temporarily block a consumer&amp;rsquo;s ability to conduct online
banking. A more strategic attack makes a key resource inaccessible
during a critical period. Some examples of this type of attack may
include rendering a florist&amp;rsquo;s website unavailable on
Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, slowing or blocking access to tax documents
in mid-April, disrupting communication during a critical trading window,
 etc. Prominent DDoS attacks have been conducted against financial
institutions, news organizations, providers of internet security
resources, and government agencies. Any organization that relies on
network resources is considered a potential target.\n\tThe current
environment provides several advantages to the attacker, considering
that the resource acquisition cost for attackers is relatively low. An
attacker often relies on a large number of compromised computers to
conduct the attack. Further, as the network bandwidth and computational
power increases, the attacker benefits from the increased resources,
providing the capability to conduct more powerful attacks. Organizations
 that make use of network services must invest in resources that keep
pace with the increasing significance of the attacks; while
organizations that fail to do so run the risk of being compromised. In
addition, organizations that deploy resources carelessly may simply
provide the attacker with easily compromised resources that can then be
used in future attacks. Even businesses with global scale reach,
including those providing security related services, have faced
challenges in keeping pace with vast DDoS attacks.\n\tThis effort seeks
tools, techniques, and policies that would help mitigate the attack
impact of a 1 Tbps attack originating from over 1,000 locations while
shifting the overall advantage from the attacker to defender. The target
 of the attack may be a hypothetical regional bank that does not have
capacity to absorb a 1 Tbps attack. Some collaborative effort will be
needed to mitigate the attack. The collaborative effort must make
reasonable assumptions on business relationships between the victim and
other ISPs, content providers, and other organizations that may be
relevant to mitigating the attack. In addition to tools that address
today&amp;rsquo;s attacks, this effort also encourages an approach that
looks forward to new DDoS attack vectors, and propose solutions for
attacks that are likely to occur in the future. Many of
today&amp;rsquo;s defenses are reactive and designed to address attack
patterns that have already been observed. The network infrastructure
continues to evolve, therefore enabling the potential for both new types
 of DDoS attacks and new defenses. For example, attackers are now
adapting to growth in smart devices, cyber physical systems, and cloud
computing, and are developing new types of DDoS attacks that exploit the
 unique characteristics of these systems. These same device
characteristics may also be used to develop new defenses. Proposals that
 look forward to network changes and exploit these changes for defense
are encouraged.\n\n\tPHASE I: Phase I proposals should describe a
specific tool or technique that can be applied in DDoS defense in the
current network, and\/or show how the tool or technique would address
network changes that might occur in the next 3-5 years. The result is
expected to include both an analysis that demonstrates the potential of
the approach and proof of concept software.\n\n\tPHASE II: A prototype
device or software capable of deployment in medium scale organization or
 government agency is desired. The developed component will be delivered
 to DHS for piloting. The component should leverage applicable and
operational best practices for the intended environment. Assertions of
security should be verified by independent 3rd parties.\n\n\tPHASE III:
COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS: Refine components from Phase II,
and work with operating systems and application developers to leverage
the functions the module provides. Ensure that the component meets the
standards necessary for the deployment in a federal government agency or
 department.\n",

Things",
        "description": "\n\tOBJECTIVE: Develop and commercialize
analytic capabilities and systems to characterize information from large
 collections of static and mobile sensors while protecting the privacy
of individuals.\n\n\tDESCRIPTION: With the rapid proliferation of
sensors, embedded systems, and big data analytics come a host of
opportunities for improving safety and security services for the public,
 critical infrastructure and first responders. As embeddable sensors and
 sensor platforms become smaller, consume less power and are dynamically
 re-configurable, a variety of applications associated with awareness,
prevention, mitigation and response can be developed to improve the
homeland security mission and operations related to catastrophic events.
 For example, an embedded accelerometer can determine impact to an
object, chemical sensors detect the presence of toxic gasses, and
physiological sensors can communicate health status. Analysis of
different sensor modalities and locations can improve the efficiency and
 accuracy of responsive actions. However, there are significant privacy
concerns associated with such individual sensors and\/or sensor readings
 involving locations and individuals. This effort explores systems that
will make it possible to accumulate process and characterize such data
in ways that are not attributable to individuals but result in analytic
results that are actionable to improve public safety and
security.\n\n\tPHASE I: Phase I will examine the feasibility of a
proposed privacy protecting system for leveraging the internet of things
 for public security and safety. During this phase, sensors, embedded
systems and scalable architecture designs will be defined that clearly
protect the privacy of individuals while producing sensor network
information that is clearly actionable for public safety and security
applications. Primarily, the performers will conduct an analysis of the
proposed system architecture and components that are relevant to the
homeland security enterprise. Although not absolutely required, for
mature concepts, performers may wish to demonstrate technical
feasibility of the privacy protection methods that are inherent in the
proposed design. Finally, depending on system maturity, performer may
prototype and\/or model a proposed system and components that
demonstrate their proof of concept. Required Phase I deliverables will
include a technical report that outlines the proposed concept and
include architecture, embedded system and sensor design requirements and
 choices. Included in the report will be an analysis of the proposed
system and results from relevant modeling activities and if available,
any experimental prototyping that reflects performance for a mutually
determined operational environment that is relevant to homeland security
 applications.\n\n\tPHASE II: In Phase II, feasible designs will be
implemented and demonstrate a priority homeland security capability in
an operationally relevant environment. (See the 2014 Quadrennial
Homeland Security Review 2014). Performers will demonstrate the efficacy
 of their design through a series of increasingly complex operations
where various aspects of privacy, security, and information accuracy are
 communicated to the government. Progress and performance analysis of
the sensors, embedded systems and architecture will be documented in the
 monthly technical reports. A robust prototype of the system will be
developed and demonstrated using design choices that are suitable for
commercialization, manufacturing and maintenance with targeted price
points that are realistic relative to market demand. Demonstrations of
the system will clearly communicate the privacy protection inherent in
the design, scalability for large applications (greater than millions of
 sensors) and the value proposition created for users and responders to
the overall system. Deliverables will include a demonstration for
privacy officials as well as the user community, a final technical
report that documents the Phase II system design, prototype sensors,
embedded systems and the architecture.\n\n\tPHASE III: COMMERCIAL OR
GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS: Capabilities that result from this effort will
lead to increased privacy for architecture designs involving high scale
sensor networks. Commercial applications are significant and include:
improved traffic flow, medical treatment, and customer service.
Government applications include the prevention of Weapons of Mass
Destruction related terrorism, situation awareness for first responders,
 and mass evacuation management.\n",

Streamline and Improve First Responder Communication Capabilities",
        "description": "\n\tOBJECTIVE: Develop a high-level, scalable
next-generation architecture and prototype for an intelligent
communications interface device (also referred to as a communications
hub) that serves to interconnect wearable technologies (e.g., video
camera, sensors, heads-up displays) and voice communication tools to an
array of radio communication devices carried by a first
responder.\n\n\tDESCRIPTION: Today, when a highly-trained first
responder arrives at an incident scene, an array of communication tools
such as land mobile radio (LMR), smartphone and other available
communication devices and sensors can overwhelm and distract the first
responder. The objective of the communications hub is to dissolve the
barrier between responders and the many available sources of critical
information.\n\tThe final goal is to integrate existing and emerging
communications technologies already under development and sensors into
responders&amp;rsquo; protective garments and standard equipment, making
 each responder a mobile, wireless communications hub and sensor
platform, linked automatically to a wide-ranging mesh network. For
example, a first responder could send a video clip collected at an
incident scene without specifying which wireless network will be used to
 transmit the video clip, and be given a notification whether the video
clip was successfully transmitted. With the creation of a broadband
network by the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet), public
safety will have access to another broadband network in addition to
their commercial provider, resulting in the ability for first responders
 to move seamlessly from one network to the other. The communications
hub will further improve the situational awareness of the first
responders in performing their duty of saving lives and protecting
property.\n\tTo enable first responders to communicate seamlessly, a
next generation communications system must include the following
features: multimedia (support emergency responder&amp;rsquo;s
requirement for voice, data and video services); user friendly (auto
detection, connection and configuration of wearable sensors and tools,
including an array of available wireless communication devices);
scalable (can incorporate new devices by using standard communication
protocol); streamlined (automatically select the optimum communication
network medium for communication); resilient (store and forward
information when communication resources are congested or unavailable);
ruggedized (able to withstand different extreme environmental
conditions); weight and size (must be wearable in lightweight, compact
enclosure); and availability (battery will support a minimum of 8 hours
of emergency response operation).\n\n\tPHASE I: Develop a high level
concept of operations for a next generation communications hub that
supports a list of the various connected wearable sensors and tools and
relevant use cases. The communications hub will also include a
conceptual scalable next generation architecture supporting multiple
networks (e.g., LMR, Commercial as well as Public Safety Broadband,
Satellite, LTE deployable, Wi-Fi, etc.) connected to existing and
theoretical first responder devices, along with a section outlining the
technical feasibility and potential improvement in operations. The
concept should embrace a standards-based approach.\n\n\tPHASE II:
Develop a detailed next generation technical architecture with width
backward compatibility along with identifying and proposing relevant
standards, and interfaces. Develop and deliver one or more working
prototype(s) and conduct a pilot(s) and\/or trial(s) to evaluate the
operational use of the proof of concept. Include a comprehensive
security assessment.\n\n\tPHASE III: COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT

possible inclusion into the current APEX program within the First

        "description": "\n\tOBJECTIVE: Develop a real time mobile X-Ray
scanning and diagnostics device that can quickly scan an entire vehicle
in near real time in order to determine if any explosive devices are
present.\n\n\tDESCRIPTION: Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosives Devices
(VBIEDs) are the choice weapons of terrorists that threaten the security
 of a society. To counter this threat, the First Responders and other
law enforcement personnel need Diagnostic Imaging tools to make a
determination of the contents of the suspicious object without
endangering the lives of the First Responders and security personnel.
Current COTS (Commercially-Off-The Shelf) Mobile X-ray Scanners are
truck mounted and neither suited for use in tight spaces or between
parked cars to scan for vehicle bombs nor autonomous. The scanners also
have a very small imaging area that makes them unsuitable for
effectively scanning large objects. Screening vehicles for threats using
 X-Ray technology is a tedious and time consuming effort for bomb
technicians. When responding to a possible vehicle bomb, a bomb
technician&amp;rsquo;s current options include manually opening the
vehicle or using techniques that physically intrude upon the vehicle
possibly resulting in physical damage to the vehicle. Bomb technicians
require a means of determining the contents of a car or truck without
physically opening or breaking into the vehicle. Three-dimensional
mapping of vehicle contents is also desired.\n\tThe mobile Total Vehicle
 X-Ray Scanner would fill this capability gap by providing bomb squads
the ability to conduct rapid mobile screening of vehicles and
identifying explosive threats in near real time. Images will be of
diagnostic resolution able to identify the threats listed above, will be
 sent to a mobile control box\/screen operated by a bomb technician
positioned a safe distance from the scanning area. The system can be
used by public safety bomb squads, law enforcement and other first
responders operating at the scene to scan suspicious vehicles that have a
 maximum height of 83 inches. The mobile platform needs to be remotely
controlled, and must be maneuverable in tight spaces. The system will
also improve the safety of first responders by allowing them to remotely
 control the device, providing a safe distance between themselves and
the target being examined.\n\tAll operations must be remotely controlled
 by a wireless link, an optical fiber, or an Ethernet cable. The system
is battery operated and can be driven around using a standard game pad.
In the event the game pad is lost or damaged, all operations including
driving and deployment can be performed by keys on a laptop. The image
of the scanned object is displayed real-time on the laptop
screen.\n\tThis scanning system will be designed to communicate with the
 laptop over a standard Wi-Fi link. In situations where there is radio
frequency interference, an optical fiber can be used to communicate
between the laptop and the scanner. The optical fiber is provided on a
spool and unwraps as the scanner drives away.\n\n\tPHASE I: Conduct and
deliver a feasibility study to determine the most suitable option and
establish requirements for the development of a Total Vehicle X-ray
Scanning device. This includes initial design drawings and a list of
materials needed.\n\n\tPHASE II: Develop and delivera Total Vehicle
X-Ray Scanner prototype. Images must be of sufficient diagnostic quality
 and resolution to clearly identify all components of an IED to include
power sources, detonators, circuit boards, and wires.\n\n\tPHASE III:
COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS: The Total Vehicle Mobile X-Ray
Scanner would be a commercially available tool for bomb technicians at
all levels of government whether federal, state or local as well as the
private sector.\n",

profile GPS with stabilized integrated camera, to real-time track,
record and transmit canine&amp;rsquo;s path of
movement.\n\n\tDESCRIPTION: Develop a tracking device that will attach
to a canine for the purpose of documenting the movements of the canine
for court\/evidence purposes or verification of area(s) that have or
have not been searched by a canine during deployments (i.e., wooded
areas, water deployment reference cadaver canines, search and rescue
operations, large crowd deployments for PB-IED K9 operations to verify
whether a canine has swept an area or not, etc.). Such a device should
be able to relay information to both the handler of the canine via a
wrist or forearm mounted remote monitor and a command coordination
center which would allow supporting teams to track the location of the
canine teams for both safety and situational awareness.\n\tThe described
 tracking device would need to be able to deploy in all types of weather
 conditions (heat, cold, wet, dry, etc.) and be able to take direct
impact strikes from objects to include but not limited to obstacles a
canine might encounter during deployments and suspects during criminal
apprehension. The mounting of such devices should be streamlined to the
canine and avoid the possibility of being entangled around certain types
 of obstacles during actual deployments (i.e., tree branches, shrubs,
fencing, furniture, etc.). The construction of such device needs to be
of a low profile configuration that is a requirement for both the safety
 of the canine and handler who may have to be exposed while freeing the
canine from becoming entangled. The proposed device should be affixed to
 a mounting device (collar, harness, etc.) that could be easily and
quickly attached to the canine prior to being deployed (sometimes
seconds can make a difference in the apprehension of a fleeing felon so
the ease of utilizing this device is a must). The information\/location
from such tracking device would also need to be archived and producible
for court purposes.\n\tThe device should be able to record the location
of evidence or other important factors observed during the deployment of
 canines (i.e., clothing, weapons, change in direction, origination
points, end points, etc.). Law enforcement canines deploy for various
reasons that consist of the apprehension of fleeing persons, lost or
medically ill persons, the recovery of evidence, the detection of
contraband, crowd control, search and rescue operations, recovery of
persons fatally injured, etc. Having a device that would track and
record information during such deployment would be instrumental in the
accuracy\/proficiency of such operation. Data output requires date, time
 and location stamping at 1 sample\/second and be capable of up to 8
hours of person borne recording media and 4 hours for canine borne
storage data. Video data requires up to 30 minutes of storage allowing
for overwriting of data over 30 minutes. All video output must be
capable of being transferred to permanent storage. Geospatial location
of 20 feet for outdoors and 10 feet for indoors are required. All
outputs must match commercial quality standards. Offerors are encouraged
 to consider all devices already on the COTS market for potential
integration and applicability in meeting the requirements described
above.\n\n\tPHASE I: Deliverable will be a design analysis that
identifies the key component technologies used in the design, the
integration approach, application to the mission areas identified, and
design approach to achieve real-time stabilized streaming video to both
handler and remote command center. The design analysis should also
detail the technical feasibility of integration of additional sensory
inputs including, but not limited to, canine physiological measurements,
 accelerometers, audio inputs and environmental conditions.\n\n\tPHASE
II: Develop and deliver five complete functioning prototypes for
Government test and evaluation, with at least one spare component
replace module for each piece of the key technologies, i.e., tracking
and recording devices. Prototypes to be sufficiently ruggedized to
operate in typical conditions of canine law enforcement deployment with a
 streamlined deployment profile that does not increase safety risk to
either the canine or handler. In addition, the Offeror shall produce a
complete developmental test and evaluation report depicting the results
of a prototype assessment in simulated (or actual) operational
conditions.\n\n\tPHASE III: COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS:
Deployment of a fully functional canine tracking device has diverse
application throughout the Homeland Security Enterprise (HSE). Major DHS
 components including the Transportation Security Administration,
Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Secret Service, Federal Emergency
Management Agency and the Federal Protective Service all maintain canine
 teams that are employed for diverse mission areas from narcotics and
explosives detection, urban and rural search and rescue and traditional
law enforcement patrol. There are over 16,000 non-Federal canine teams
nationwide under the HSE umbrella that could have operational use of an
effective tracking device. This device could be commercialized for use
within the federal, state and local canine communities with a potential
for use in the recreational canine community with some modification.\n",

Aquaculture in the United States",
        "description": "\n\tSummary:&amp;nbsp; Shellfish represent the
largest sector of marine aquaculture in the United States, accounting
for approximately two thirds of marine aquaculture production. Domestic
shellfish production provides a source of seafood for growing demand,
creates coastal jobs and business opportunities, builds habitat for
important commercial and recreation species, restores native
populations, protects shorelines, and provides ecosystem services such
as improvement of water quality. In recognizing the broad suite of
economic, social and environmental benefits domestic shellfish
production provides, NOAA established the National Shellfish Initiative
in 2011 with the goal to increase populations of bivalve shellfish in
our nation&amp;rsquo;s coastal waters through sustainable commercial
production and restoration activities.\n\n\tHatcheries and controlled
nursery systems are playing a greater role in commercial and restoration
 aquaculture. Shellfish hatcheries are at an early stage of development,
 with many opportunities for technological improvement. Shellfish seed
production, hatching and larval survival are consistent bottlenecks for
commercial shellfish production. Proposals are requested for research
towards innovative products and services to improve shellfish seed
production. Priority is given to research that addresses these key
bottlenecks to boost domestic commercial shellfish production and in
turn enhance ecosystem services, increase our sustainable seafood supply
 and create economic opportunities for coastal
communities.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProject Goals:&amp;nbsp; New
technologies, products and methods are needed to improve commercial
shellfish seed production. Projects that would support production
improvements can include but are not limited to: technologies, methods
or seed strains developed for disease prevention or resistance
(vaccines, systems to minimize, eliminate and control pathogens,
hatchery water treatment technologies), early disease detection
(real-time monitoring systems), ocean acidification resistance,
acclimation or mitigation, increased seed production (performance
traits, live food quality, food deliver, tools to assess reproduction
and maturation potential), improved reproduction (heritability and
genetic correlation estimates, selective breeding) or larval survival.
As ocean acidification continues to impact our domestic shellfish
industry, new technologies or methods that address this increasingly
prevalent issue are especially essential.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I

Kit",
        "description": "\n\tSummary:&amp;nbsp; Provide coastal managers
with a low-cost test kit that can be used for real-time toxicity testing
 at beaches vulnerable to harmful algal blooms (HABs). The availability
of low-cost assays will enable rapid determination of HAB severity at
multiple locations.&amp;nbsp; This information will provide actionable
data for coastal management in near real-time and will serve to improve
forecasts.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProject Goals:&amp;nbsp; Toxins in
coastal waters are difficult to monitor.&amp;nbsp; Current methods are
slow and the delay can result in potential threats to human health and
loss of economic activity. This is particularly true of the toxins
produced by harmful algal blooms which are becoming more frequent and
must be continuously measured at public beaches to ensure public safety.
 Two issues that must be overcome in field tests for toxins in seawater
are the complexity of sample processing and the lack of rugged
measurement devices. To overcome these limitations, we are seeking
proposals for the development of rapid field test kit for brevetoxins in
 seawater analogous to the glucose meters commonly used by diabetics.
Brevetoxins are potent neurotoxins produced by blooms of the microalga
Karenia brevis. When these blooms reach the beach, cells are broken open
 in the surf zone releasing toxic aerosols which cause respiratory
distress.&amp;nbsp; The consumption of shellfish contaminated with
brevetoxins can induce neurotoxic shellfish
poisoning.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tCurrently, when this happens in Florida,
 the standard protocol is to issue a generic warning is issued at a
county to half-county level, despite the fact that many times only
specific beaches are adversely affected. The result of the generic
warning is that it leads to unnecessary economic losses when people
avoid beach areas which are actually safe. To address these issues, NOAA
 is developing a comprehensive monitoring system which will allow
brevetoxin testing of each potentially affected beach in Florida every
day to protect human health and reduce economic losses. Consequently,
there is a need for rapid, easy to use, rugged and inexpensive detection
 methodologies which allow toxins to be measured
onsite.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe goal of this solicitation is to develop
 a low-cost, easy-to-use sampling system to enable a sustainable
volunteer monitoring program (lifeguards, others) that tests daily for
the presence of brevetoxin at every beach along the entire FL west
coast.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables:\n\n\tDevelop a plan to fabricate a portable, low-cost,
easy-to-use detection system for detection of the algal toxins
brevetoxin-2, -3 in seawater containing toxic Karenia brevis
cells.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe test kit must
provide:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 A rapid method for processing seawater samples containing toxic K.
brevis cells prior to
analysis.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Ability to measure toxin in the seawater at levels found when 50,000 to
 1,000,000 K. brevis cells are present in the water column. A toxic K.
brevis cell contains on average 10 to 16 femtograms of brevetoxins-2, -3
 per cell.&amp;nbsp; The assay sensitivity will therefore depend on the
amount of sample that has to be processed.&amp;nbsp; The smaller the
volume required for processing, the more feasible the assay will be for
application in the field. It is estimated that the lower sensitivity
will be in the 0.3 parts per billion range or
lower.\n\n\t&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

ultimately be used on the beach so a discussion of how the proposed
reagents would need to be stored and handled to make the assay feasible

Arrays",
        "description": "\n\tSummary:&amp;nbsp; Passive acoustics has
been increasingly used for population estimation during shipboard
cetacean surveys conducted by NMFS Science Centers.&amp;nbsp; Towed
linear arrays are well-developed but are limited in their ability to
provide real-time 3D localization.&amp;nbsp; This is important for
application to deep-diving species such as beaked whales, and for
real-time localization of a single sound, which is important for
line-transect surveys.&amp;nbsp; Development of a volumetric (nonlinear)
 towed hydrophone array can provide improved localization and, when used
 in combination with existing modular linear arrays, can provide
instantaneous localization to sound sources using a single sound. These
improvements are valuable not only for NMFS population surveys, but for
detection of cetaceans during mitigation efforts (seismic industries,
Navy) and have the potential to aid in search and rescue efforts (beacon
 detection\/localization).\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tCurrent
development of volumetric towed hydrophones show great potential, but
have been limited by increased flow noise, tension, and instability at
high speeds (Rankin, 2013b, Southall, et al., 2012).&amp;nbsp; NOAA
Fisheries is requesting the development of nonlinear (volumetric) towed
hydrophone array that can be used with current modular array systems
developed by NMFS Science Centers (see Rankin et al.
2013a).\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProject Goals:&amp;nbsp; The goal of this
project is to develop a functioning nonlinear array using affordable
materials and a modular design that will provide accurate 3D
localization of marine mammals in real-time.&amp;nbsp; The modular
design must be compatible with towed hydrophones developed by NMFS
Science Centers (Rankin et al. 2013a). Extensive testing by NMFS has
identified a pre-amplification system that works well with HTI 96min
hydrophones and 12v power; deviation from this should be well tested and
 compatible with NMFS systems.&amp;nbsp; The prototypes should be robust
 and stable when towed at 10 knots behind a research vessel. Materials
must be compatible with underwater acoustic detection (acoustically
transparent and either negatively or neutrally buoyant).&amp;nbsp; The
prototypes should consist of modular components such that repairs and
replacement of individual components can be conducted by the users in
field situations.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tAs many of the preliminary tests
have already been conducted by NMFS Science Centers, we expect that
development of an initial prototype can be conducted during Phase 1. We
expect that Phase 2 will consist of repeated testing of modified
prototypes until a stable and robust system is developed.&amp;nbsp;
During commercial development phase, individual components should be
available for replacement.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I Activities and

 Trajectories",
        "description": "\n\tSummary:&amp;nbsp; The Caribbean Sea, Gulf
of Mexico, and Straits of Florida contain spawning areas for a number of
 ecologically and economically important reef, mesopelagic, and pelagic
fish species.&amp;nbsp; However, little is known regarding the transport
 and distribution of fish larvae throughout the area.&amp;nbsp;
Understanding the degree of biological connectivity between remote
marine areas by means of ocean currents, versus local recruitment of
larvae, often aided by ocean eddies, will require targeted observations
using the development of new observational techniques.&amp;nbsp;
Observations from a platform able to monitor these trajectories and to
assess larval transport are critical in biochemical models, to assess
the link of the ocean and climate variability on ecosystems, and to
improve current ecosystem numerical forecasts from seasonal to climate
timescales. Existing observations for measuring larval trajectories
currently rely on surface drifters, which are large buoys. The shape,
size, and other characteristics of the standard drifter do not resemble
those of fish larvae.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A new observational platform
is needed to improve ecosystems assessments. Major issues to address
will be: size of the platform, buoyancy changes to adapt for diurnal
effects, measuring parameters such as temperature and salinity,
determining their precise location, data recording and transmission,
durability, cost-effectiveness, and
expendability.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProject Goals:&amp;nbsp; Ocean
variability, climate change, extreme weather events, and distress in
ecosystems are linked to complex environmental patterns and with larval
transport and distribution.&amp;nbsp; The goal is to design a new
observational platform that can assess fish larvae trajectories and
transports in order to properly associate them with changes in ocean
dynamics, climate, and ecosystem parameters.&amp;nbsp; The main focal
areas of this work are:&amp;nbsp; 1) hardware and 2)
capabilities.&amp;nbsp; Each of them presents a number of technical
challenges.&amp;nbsp; Successful projects will produce a platform with a
 desired size (&amp;lt;10cm in diameter), biodegradable construction
materials, in a cost-effectiveness fashion (up to $300 per unit); with
capabilities that include changes in buoyancy (vertical motion of up to
10m), battery life (of the order of months to years), real-time
transmission, data recording system, and capability to observe a minimum
 suite of environmental parameters, such as location, pressure and
depth, temperature, salinity, light intensity, with an error of less
than 5%.&amp;nbsp; The final platform will be a package that houses all
sensors and suitable for ocean field
deployments.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected

surge mapping.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tToday, LIDARs, synthetic aperture
radars, Doppler radars and altimeters are used to provide surface
topography and surface water current mapping. However, these
technologies can be expensive to operate, provide limited coverage, may
not always be deployable from aircraft or are limited to specific
aircraft and flight altitudes. Debris and surface contamination
detection is becoming more important as events such as the tsunami in
Japan and Gulf oil spill occur. As the climate changes, coastal and
inland flooding is on the rise and more timely and cost effective means
are required to map the surface water and terrestrial topography in
these regions to better assess and prepare for weather and flooding
events.&amp;nbsp; In events such as land falling hurricanes real-time
monitoring before, during and after of coastal regions and water ways is
 necessary to more efficiently deploy limited resources and provide
society with the necessary information to prepare and react to these
events in order to minimize loss of life and impact on the
economy.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tNOAA seeks innovative sensor that can
provide large swath measurements of the items listed above in a cost
effective manner, deployable on multiple airborne platforms, manned and
unmanned, up to 70 kft altitudes, and operational in large range of
atmospheric conditions (e.g. cloud
covered).\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProject Goals:&amp;nbsp; This project
seeks an innovative solution that addresses coastal observational
requirements currently requiring several different types of sensors
operated from a variety of platforms.&amp;nbsp; Knowledge of the coastal
 zone environment (topography, surface currents, debris in water ways,
and impacts of storm surge) before, during and after significant weather
 events is critically important for both long term and short term
planning and mitigation activities.&amp;nbsp; A solution that addresses
these observation requirements that can quickly and efficiently create
maps over large swaths from an airborne platform (manned and unmanned)
would be a great benefit to NOAA&amp;rsquo;s mission

Far-Side of the Sun",
        "description": "\n\tSummary:&amp;nbsp; Space weather impacts a
growing number of technologies that our society depends on. The need for
 space weather forecasts arose in the 1940s when the first radio
communications were established. The Department of Defense relies on
many technologies, such as early warning radars and satellite
navigation,that are susceptible to space weather. The list of civil
activities that are impacted include, electric power, commercial
airlines, oil exploration, satellites, space exploration, agriculture,
surveying and road building, just to name a few. Forecasting space
weather has become a critical activity for NOAA, the US Air Force, and a
 number of space weather forecast offices around the world. With the
increased need for space weather information there has grown a network
of commercial service providers who provide specific and tailored space
weather forecast services to both industry and government. Any or all of
 the entities would be interested in new techniques for forecasting
space weather.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tMost major space weather events
originate from the Sun. Seen from Earth, the sun rotates once every 27
days. Solar active regions grow and recede as they rotate around the
sun. Knowing how an active region develops while it is on the far-side
of the Sun (not visible from Earth) helps forecasters predict what will
happen when that active region rotates back to the Earth-directed side
of the Sun. Techniques to better understand the development of solar
activity on the far side of the sun improve the 5-10 day forecasts of
space weather storms.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProject Goals:&amp;nbsp;
There are several newly developed techniques that allow us to monitor
developments on the far-side of the sun. These include helioselismology
(solar surface motions that originate from major eruptions) and
observing the faint light scattered off the solar atmosphere beyond the
sun. The recent NASA STEREO mission has flown satellites to observe the
far-side of the Sun but these satellites will move beyond the ideal
locations and become much less useful for far-side imaging. Instead,
they have provided data that helps to develop and validate new
techniques. They also proved how important knowledge of the far-side of
the Sun can be to space weather forecasting.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I

Increased Spatial Resolution",
        "description": "\n\tSummary:&amp;nbsp; Ultrasonic
anemometers\/thermometers are commercially produced, robust instruments
for measurements of temperature and velocity. Much of a progress in the
boundary layer meteorology over the last few decades can be attributed
to the wide use of these instruments. Due to concerns about wind
distortion, the transducers of an ultrasonic anemometer are located at
some distance from each other. As a result, the anemometer enables only
path-averaged measurements of temperature and velocity, with a spatial
resolution larger than about 15 cm. There are, however, several
important applications\/concerns in the boundary layer meteorology and
theories of turbulence which require analysis of turbulent fields at
smaller scales. Among these are: (i) studies of the inertial subrange at
 small scales which are important for analysis of the dissipation rate
and the turbulent kinetic energy budget, (ii) studies of turbulence
closure models, (iii) studies of energy transfer in the atmospheric
boundary layer which are important, for example, for wind energy, (iv)
measurements of turbulence, particularly momentum and heat fluxes, when
the energy-containing range extends to spatial scales smaller than those
 resolved by currently used ultrasonic anemometers, e.g., near the
surface or within canopies, (v) studies of small scale turbulence for
the Ameriflux CO2 flux network. In principle, hot-wire and cold-wire
anemometers enable one to make measurements of small-scale turbulence.
However, these anemometers are not reliable instruments and often break
down. Furthermore, they might disturb the flow around them. Therefore,
there is a need for a new generation of ultrasonic
anemometers\/thermometers with increased spatial
resolution.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProject Goals:&amp;nbsp; The main goals
 of the project are to develop a concept and a prototype of a new
generation of ultrasonic anemometers\/thermometers with increased
spatial resolution, with a final goal to produce them commercially.
Different approaches for achieving these goals can be considered
including but not limited to acoustic tomography. A new generation of
ultrasonic anemometers should be reliable, robust instruments designed
to work in harsh conditions ranging from tropical marine environments to
 Polar Regions. The spatial resolution of such instruments should be
increased to about 1-2 cm, with a potential to resolve even smaller
scales.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected

anemometer\/thermometer with increased spatial

such ultrasonic anemometers.\n\t\n\t\tDevelop a plan to commercialize a

 Weather and Climate Applications",
        "description": "\n\tSummary: The excellent on-orbit performance
of the Suomi NPP VIIRS Day Night Band (DNB) ushers in a new era of low
light imaging at night.&amp;nbsp; Its extreme sensitivity to low lights
has already been demonstrated in numerous emerging applications, e.g.,
the rescue of a Bering Sea Fleet crab fishing vessel trapped in ice in
the winter of 2013 in Alaska.&amp;nbsp; This unprecedented capability
heavily depends on its onboard calibration, which unfortunately has one
significant limitation:&amp;nbsp; it relies on solar signal which is
more than seven orders of magnitudes brighter than the faint lights from
 fishing vessels.&amp;nbsp; As a result, the absolute calibration
accuracy for the low night light is no better than 15%.&amp;nbsp; Also,
the stability of the calibration for low light over time cannot yet be
verified.&amp;nbsp; A significant calibration issue may diminish the
ability in distinguishing fishing vessels from noise.&amp;nbsp;
Furthermore, since the fishing light is typically a point source, both
radiometric and spatial response of the DNB must be evaluated together,
which is not possible with traditional methods.&amp;nbsp; This leads to
the unmet needs for accurate (3&amp;times; better) active light sources
at night to validate and monitor the DNB responses to maintain its
performance.&amp;nbsp; This will allow us to continue assisting in
search and rescue of manmade faint light objects under severe weather
conditions such as Hurricanes and Ice storms, helping the society to
prepare for and respond to weather related events.&amp;nbsp; It will
also allow us to monitor the light intensity of human settlements and
their energy use, and many other natural low light phenomena over time,
to study climate change and its anthropogenic
contributions\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProject Goals: &amp;nbsp;The goals of
 this project are to develop and deploy accurate active light sources
(AALS) to selected calibration sites for the calibration\/validation of
the VIIRS DNB low light performance.&amp;nbsp; The long term stability
of the AALS, after characterizing and correcting any systematic drift,
should be maintained at 1%, and the absolute accuracy of the light
sources should be better than 5%.&amp;nbsp; The AALS will only be turned
 on during the VIIRS DNB overpass at night around 1:30am local
time.&amp;nbsp; The light intensity should be higher than
3&amp;times;10-9 W\/cm2&amp;middot;sr in order to be useful for DNB
calibration.&amp;nbsp; These light sources will be used as benchmarks
for comparisons with objects of interest on the DNB imagery.&amp;nbsp;
Once the methodology is demonstrated at one site, it can be expanded to
many other sites, potentially
internationally.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected

its programs and priorities as a service agency.\n\n\tMany of the
challenges that NOAA helps address do not stem from a lack of
information, but from an uneven distribution of information.&amp;nbsp;
The best way for NOAA to meet the needs of its stakeholders is often to
better deliver data and knowledge to those who have not yet accessed
it.\n\n\tNOAA is requesting proposals that provide innovative
technologies for communicating NOAA&amp;rsquo;s science and data
products with the public.&amp;nbsp; Examples of appropriate topics for
research and technology development applications from small businesses
include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n\t\n\t\tDesign of new
and innovative decision support tools for government and emergency
responders that incorporate and deliver NOAA data in real-time to the
public in an easily accessible and understandable format such
as:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCell phone or tablet
applications\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWebsites or stand-alone computer
programs\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInnovative user-interfaces for displaying
complex geospatial data in ways that are easily understandable to the
non-scientist\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of applications or
technologies that engage stakeholder groups at the community level to
improve NOAA&amp;rsquo;s capacity to efficiently inform
decision-making\n\t\n\t\tCreation of technologies that improve the use
and understanding of NOAA&amp;rsquo;s scientific information, products,

        "description": "\n\tPurpose\n\n\tThe purpose of this funding
opportunity is to reduce health disparities through the development and
translation of appropriate medical technologies.&amp;nbsp; The NIH
defines health disparities as differences in the incidence, prevalence,
morbidity, mortality, and burden of diseases and other adverse health
outcomes that exist among specific population groups.&amp;nbsp; These
population groups include racial and ethnic minorities (African
Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Hispanic
Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other U.S. Pacific Islanders,
subpopulations of all of these racial\/ethnic groups), socioeconomically
 disadvantaged individuals, and medically underserved populations
including individuals residing in rural and urban areas.&amp;nbsp;
Appropriate medical technologies must have the following basic
characteristics: effective, affordable, culturally acceptable, and
easily accessible to those who need them.&amp;nbsp; Responsive grant
applications must involve a formal collaboration with a healthcare
provider or other healthcare organization serving one or more health
disparity populations during Phase I and Phase II. &amp;nbsp; This
announcement supports applications to develop medical devices, imaging
systems, and other technologies that adequately address the healthcare
needs of health disparity populations.&amp;nbsp; It is expected that
responsive grant applications will result in advances in medical
technologies that will be invaluable in reducing health disparities
within and across the priority areas of cardiovascular disease, stroke,
cancer, diabetes, HIV\/AIDS, infant mortality, mental health, and
obesity, as well as lung, liver, and kidney diseases, psoriasis,
scleroderma, and other diseases, illnesses, and conditions of public
health importance.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tMedical and scientific advances
have introduced new opportunities for the continued improvement of
health for all Americans. However, in spite of notable improvements
gained as a result of the technological advancement, there continues to
be an alarming disproportionate burden of illness among minority and
other health disparity populations.&amp;nbsp; Overcoming persistent
disparities in healthcare access and health outcomes remains a foremost
challenge. To meet this challenge, the NIH is committed to supporting a
wide range of research, aimed at the development of innovative
diagnostics, treatments, and preventative strategies to reduce, and
eventually eliminate, health disparities.\n\n\tResearch Objectives and
Scope\n\n\tThe primary objective of this funding opportunity is to
support the translation of medical technologies, new or existing, that
can have a significant impact on healthcare access and health outcomes
for health disparity populations.&amp;nbsp; Small business concerns
(SBCs) are invited to submit grant applications proposing to develop and
 deliver appropriate technologies to health disparity
populations.&amp;nbsp; Responsive grant applications must involve a
formal collaboration with a healthcare provider or other healthcare
organization serving one or more health disparity populations during
Phase I and Phase II. A requisite component of the research plan is a
description of the healthcare requirements and needs of the population
and the existing barriers to adequate healthcare delivery. Several of
these barriers have been identified and are described below.
Applications submitted to this funding opportunity must address one or
more of these barriers in developing technologies that will impact
health disparities:\n\n\t\n\t\tPhysical Barriers&amp;mdash;factors such
as proximity to healthcare facilities and transportation may limit
access to healthcare\n\t\n\t\tKnowledge Barriers&amp;mdash;health
literacy and language barriers can inhibit healthcare delivery, as well
as a lack of patient information for the healthcare
provider\n\t\n\t\tInfrastructure Barriers&amp;mdash;rural hospitals and
community health centers may not have the same resources and expertise
of large hospitals, and may not be able to afford advanced medical
technologies\n\t\n\t\tEconomic Barriers&amp;mdash;lack of insurance
coverage or financial resources may also contribute to disparities in
healthcare access\n\t\n\t\tCultural Barriers&amp;mdash;religious beliefs
 and social customs often deter certain populations from seeking
healthcare\n\n\n\tAppropriate technologies may be new and innovative, or
 they may be existing technologies that have been redesigned based on
the needs of a specific health disparity population.&amp;nbsp;
Appropriate technologies have been defined as effective, affordable,
culturally acceptable, and deliverable to those who need them. To be
effective, a technology must provide an improvement over the current
quality of care for a health disparity population by overcoming one or
more of the barriers. The technology must also be low-cost, so as to be
affordable to the local hospital, community health center, primary care
physician, or individual patient in need.&amp;nbsp; For a medical
technology to be adopted by a health disparity population, the
technology development must be amenable to the population&amp;rsquo;s
cultural beliefs and social customs.&amp;nbsp; Acceptance of the
technology by the population is critical to the successful delivery of
quality healthcare.&amp;nbsp; To be physically delivered to those in
need, a technology must be developed within the specifications of the
operating environment of the end-user.&amp;nbsp; The technology must be
able to function given the existing resources and expertise within
health disparity populations. Keeping in mind the barriers that
contribute to health disparities, a non-inclusive list of appropriate
medical technologies that might achieve the objectives of this
initiative may be found below:\n\n\t\n\t\tTelehealth technologies for
remote diagnosis and monitoring\n\t\n\t\tSensors for point-of-care
diagnosis\n\t\n\t\tDevices for in-home monitoring\n\t\n\t\tMobile,
portable diagnostic and therapeutic systems\n\t\n\t\tDevices which
integrate diagnosis and treatment\n\t\n\t\tDiagnostics or treatments
that do not require special training\n\t\n\t\tDevices that can operate
in low-resource environments\n\t\n\t\tNon-invasive technologies for
diagnosis and treatment\n\t\n\t\tIntegrated, automated system to assess
or monitor a specific condition\n\t\n\t\tSome examples include, but are
not limited to\n\t\n\t\tInexpensive diabetic test strip and\/or blood
sugar monitoring.&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tUse of currently available basic
technology (e.g. phone lines, televisions with remote controls,
cellphones, weight scales, diabetic glucometers, thermometers) within
underserved settings to promote self-management and patient education,
increase patient-clinician communication and surveillance of chronic
disease conditions.\n\t\n\t\tTelemedicine to improve access to specialty
 care which would normally not be accessible because of high cost and
transportation.&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tImproved early detection (via saliva
testing, breath testing, blood testing) of diseases where there are
significant health disparities.\n\t\n\t\tLow-cost portable imaging for
prevention and early detection of conditions where there are significant
 health disparities (e.g. breast cancer screening and portable retinal
imaging).\n\n",

Announcement (FOA) invites Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
grant applications from small business concerns (SBCs) to propose
research to develop tools and technology for diagnosis, intervention and
 improvement of outcomes for pregnancies and infants with known
neurologic disease or infants at high risk for neurologic
complications.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tImproving pregnancy outcome is a
prime mission for Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development (NICHD). Neonatal neurologic disease
contributes a significant burden to patients, their families and
society. Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) affects up to 3.3\/1000 term and
late preterm infants in the developed world. Hypoxic ischemic
encephalopathy (HIE), a subset of neonatal encephalopathy, affects
1-2\/1000 infants per year. Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the outcomes
associated with NE and HIE, and approximately 30% of term and late
preterm CP will have neonatal encephalopathy. The prevalence of CP is
2\/1000 live births and approximately two thirds are born at term or
late preterm. Premature infants, infants with metabolic disease, and
sequelae of complications in the neonatal period can lead to significant
 neurologic morbidity. Technologies to assess pregnancies at risk for
infants with deleterious neurologic outcomes as well as tools to treat
such infants are needed to affect outcome. A workshop held in May 2013
at NICHD highlighted the need for continued
support.\n\n\tObjectives\n\n\tThe goal of this initiative is to develop
tools and technology for diagnosis, intervention and improvement of
outcomes for pregnancies and infants with known neurologic disease or
infants at high risk for neurologic complications. There is a need to
foster collaboration between clinical and bioengineering research
investigators in the field of tools and technologies for assessment of
pregnancies and infants with or at risk of neurologic complications.
This FOA invites SBCs to propose innovative research that can lead to
development of non-invasive, or minimally invasive, instruments,
devices, tools, and technologies to assess, monitor, and treat women
during pregnancy as well as neonates and infants with or at high risk
for neurologic problems.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tResearch Objectives and
Scope\n\n\tProjects involving biomarker identification, and development
of tools to screen, prognosticate, and diagnose high risk and at risk
pregnancies and infants, novel neuroprotective agents and strategies, as
 well as interventions for neurologic disorders would be deemed
responsive to this initiative.\n\n\tSpecific areas of interest could
include, but are not limited to:\n\n\t\n\t\tAssessment of fetal neural
integrity\n\t\n\t\tIntrapartum neurologic assessment and
monitoring\n\t\n\t\tNeuroprotective resuscitation tools\n\t\n\t\tNovel
methods of monitoring and delivering hypothermic neural rescue,
particularly during high risk transport\n\t\n\t\tNovel strategies to
improve neurologic function in infants affected with neurologic
conditions, particularly those infants at highest risk for cerebral
palsy\n\t\n\t\tNon-invasive or minimally invasive tools of assessment of
 neurologic function including blood flow, oxygen delivery and
utilization, seizure detection and management, and methods to monitor
other systemic organ functions in high-risk infants affected by
neurological illnesses; simple tools to assess status of sleep and
wakefulness; and physiologic function\n\t\n\t\tThe tools and methods to
screen special sensory systems (visual, auditory, tactile, and
olfactory); and tools to assess and grade pain perception\n\t\n\t\tTools
 and methods to assess the integrity of the autonomous nervous system,
including studies related to the study of gut motility and
function\n\n\n\tThe proposed studies should establish the accuracy and
safety of the tool being developed under varied clinical conditions.
Studies may range from concept to developmental phases, with the goal of
 developing technologies that can be marketed, and used in regular
clinical settings for pregnant women and newborn
infants.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;\n",

Technologies",
        "description": "&amp;nbsp;\nSensors (SE)  Recent technological
advancements in materials science and bioengineered systems have made
inexpensive, powerful, and ubiquitous sensing a reality. Examples range
from truly smart airframes and self-evaluating buildings and
infrastructure for natural hazard mitigation to large-scale weather
forecasting, self-organizing energy systems, and smart devices that
self-assemble into networks leading to the first electronic nervous
system that connects the Internet back to the physical world. New
detection technologies that overcome barriers of time, scale, materials,
 and environment, and emphasize self-calibration, selectivity, and
sensitivity are solicited. \n&amp;nbsp;\nWireless Technologies (WT)
Wireless has become the platform for many applications with direct
impact on virtually every aspect of life, evolving well beyond mobile
phones and PDAs to other devices, services, channels, and content.
Microwave circuits afford wider frequency spectrum and very short
antennae. With GaAs and SiGe, entire microwave transceivers can be
inexpensively put on a single chip. Modulation methods, like
spread-spectrum and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, bring
greater spectral efficiency and more bits\/Hz of bandwidth, and lead to
less susceptibility to noise, interference, and multi-path distortion.
On-chip DSPs allow new signal-processing functions. RFID chips are
providing improvements in warehousing, materials handling, and shipping
operations, replacing bar-code labels in many areas.\n&amp;nbsp;\nWT1.
Systems and Devices Proposals that involve next generation wireless
communication technologies requiring systems with high data rates, low
cost, and that support a wide variety of applications and services,
while maintaining full mobility, minimum latency, and long battery life
are sought.\n&amp;nbsp;\nWT2. Spectrum Usage Proposals in the areas of
spectrum-related research and development activities that improve the
efficiency by which the radio spectrum is used, and the ability of all
Americans to access spectrum-related services.\n&amp;nbsp;\nEnergy and
Power Management (EP) In the power electronics realm, as CMOS chips go
to finer lithography with each new generation, their multiplying
transistors require lower voltages and higher currents. These trends
have driven up power demands on printed circuit boards and placed
constant pressure on power-supply and power-system developers to
increase the efficiency and power or current density. At the same time,
the trends toward lower voltages and higher currents have encouraged
migration from centralized to distributed and portable power
architectures.\n&amp;nbsp;\nEP1. Electronic Devices, Boards and
Interfaces Newer chips with lower supply-voltage requirements has
greatly complicated power-system and power-supply design. Innovations in
 the areas of low-power device design and manufacturing as well as
printed circuit and other boards that will operate at lower power and
longer lifetimes are welcome.\n&amp;nbsp;\nEP2. Sustainable Energy
Harvesting, Storage and Management - Device and System Level Proposals
are solicited in the areas of electronic systems for portable energy
sources for mobile technologies and off-grid type applications,
including new energy sources. Proposals in the areas of power management
 systems for energy scavenging\/harvesting and compact energy conversion
 systems, conversion from renewable resources, interface devices between
 batteries and super-capacitors as well as smart power demand-response
management systems are welcome. Proposals with ideas on nature-inspired
processes for sustainable energy solutions and carbon storage, reducing
the carbon and resource intensity of hydrocarbon extraction, energy
conversion, and its uses are sought. Innovative projects may include new
 critical devices, components, and systems for energy harvesting and
conversion from renewable resources (excluding solar technologies).
Refer to PH topic for solar technologies.\n&amp;nbsp;\nEP3. Smart Grids

portable and mobile devices, smart power demand-response management
systems (e.g. smart grids, buildings, and circuits), inverters, motors,
and generators for higher efficiency, smaller size and power factor
corrections are encouraged.\n&amp;nbsp;\nRobotics and Human Assistive
Technologies (RH) Considerable progress will be made if robots possessed
 the high intelligence needed to cope with uncertainty, learn from
experience, and work as a team. Robot designers are borrowing features
from insect nervous systems, and engineers and computer scientists
collaborate with biologists, neuroscientists, and psychologists to
exploit new knowledge in the study of the brain and behavior. Some
robots will help people do what they can't or would rather not do. Other
 robots will tackle complex projects by working as teams. Robots will
help protect critical infrastructure and monitor the environment as
mobile, intelligent sensors. High-performance processors, hardware to
provide situational awareness, and improved artificial intelligence (AI)
 are enabling researchers to create lifelike robots with an entire gamut
 of facial expressions.\n&amp;nbsp;\nRH1. Learning, Intelligence and
Motion Proposals addressing robot intelligence and experiential
learning, particularly those in the areas of high-performance
processors\/hardware to provide situational awareness, and improved
artificial intelligence, are welcome. Innovations in voice, obstacle and
 image recognition, emotional response, and eye-hand coordination are
encouraged. Proposals describing projects that borrow features from
other animal nervous systems and include biologists, neuroscientists,
and\/or psychologists in their team in order to exploit new knowledge in
 the study of the brain and behavior, are encouraged.\n&amp;nbsp;\nRH2.
Robotic Applications Proposals involving robotics and intelligent
machines having complex, human-like behavior for applications such as
the protection of critical infrastructure or the monitoring of the
environment while using mobile technologies and sensors networks are
sought. Innovations in areas such as improved time imaging,
visualization, dexterity and manipulation, anthropomorphic
(human-shaped) robots, naturally inspired, biomimetic, neuromechanical
robotics, haptic, real-time and bio-inspired feedback are also welcome.
Other applications, including (but not limited to) precision
agriculture, are also appropriate.\n&amp;nbsp;\nRH3. Robotics in Agile
Manufacturing  Proposals that address next-generation automation, the
flexible and rapid reconfiguration of assembly lines allowing mass
customization, the use of advanced control, scheduling, modularization,
and decentralization with agile, mobile robotic systems that can enable
the cost-effective manufacture of small, lot-size products are
sought.\n&amp;nbsp;\nRH4. Co-Robots Innovations in the development of
co-robots, robots that work symbiotically (beside, in direct support, or
 cooperatively) with people, to extend or augment human capacities are
welcome. Proposals describing the next generation of robotic systems
able to safely co-exist in close proximity to humans in the pursuit of
mundane, dangerous, precise, or expensive tasks; for sensors and
perception, actuators and control, intelligence, machine learning
techniques, architectures, systems, human\/robot interfaces, and other
developments that either realize or help to realize co-robots in
manufacturing, service, construction, exploration, and assistive
applications are encouraged.\n&amp;nbsp;\nRH5. Control and Architecture
Proposals involving novel and advanced approaches to sensing,
perception, and actuation in embedded and highly distributed systems;
intelligent control architecture for robotic systems; the development of
 human-robot interfaces; communication and task sharing between humans
and machines, and among machines; and self-diagnosing, self-repairing
robots, are sought.\n&amp;nbsp;\nRH6. Human Assistive Technologies and
Bio-related Robotics  Proposals to support the physical and educational
needs of individuals with disabilities - e.g. vision, hearing,
cognitive, motor related - are sought. Robotic applications in
healthcare (tele-robotics, robotic prosthesis, robot-assisted rehab,
miniature robotics, high-throughput technologies - imaging, screening of
 drugs, surgical procedures) are appropriate. Medical devices that
provide new capabilities to doctors including surgery; robotic
exoskeletons to enhance human strength; personal robots with an emphasis
 on human-centered end use and interaction, increased autonomy; robots
of augmentation are welcome. Proposals that address concepts for
protecting human hands (in various extreme environmental conditions),
and haptic, real-time and bio-inspired feedback concepts and mechanisms
are also sought. \n&amp;nbsp;\nMicro-electronics Packaging, Thermal
Management &amp;amp; Systems Integration (MT) Proposals are solicited on
 more efficient means of integrating semiconductor components and
devices into systems. The growth in chip density, coupled with the
demand for high performance, small size, light weight, and affordable
reliability has placed enormous pressure on interconnect technology and
packaging at all levels. Innovations include (but not limited to)
improved techniques for interconnect and packaging at the board level,
packaging approaches for the board components, the passive components,
techniques for board assembly, and applications of techniques to
packaging and systems integration for optoelectronics and wireless
systems.\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\nAgency

        "topic_name": "Electronic Hardware, Robotics and Wireless
Technologies (EW)",
        "description": "Sensors (SE)  Recent technological advancements
in materials science and bioengineered systems have made inexpensive,
powerful, and ubiquitous sensing a reality. Examples range from truly
smart airframes and self-evaluating buildings and infrastructure for
natural hazard mitigation to large-scale weather forecasting,
self-organizing energy systems, and smart devices that self-assemble
into networks leading to the first electronic nervous system that
connects the Internet back to the physical world. New detection
technologies that overcome barriers of time, scale, materials, and
environment, and emphasize self-calibration, selectivity, and
sensitivity are solicited. \nWireless Technologies (WT) Wireless has
become the platform for many applications with direct impact on
virtually every aspect of life, evolving well beyond mobile phones and
PDAs to other devices, services, channels, and content. Microwave
circuits afford wider frequency spectrum and very short antennae. With
GaAs and SiGe, entire microwave transceivers can be inexpensively put on
 a single chip. Modulation methods, like spread-spectrum and orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing, bring greater spectral efficiency and
more bits\/Hz of bandwidth, and lead to less susceptibility to noise,
interference, and multi-path distortion. On-chip DSPs allow new
signal-processing functions. RFID chips are providing improvements in
warehousing, materials handling, and shipping operations, replacing
bar-code labels in many areas.\nWT1. Systems and Devices Proposals that
involve next generation wireless communication technologies requiring
systems with high data rates, low cost, and that support a wide variety
of applications and services, while maintaining full mobility, minimum
latency, and long battery life are sought.\nWT2. Spectrum Usage
Proposals in the areas of spectrum-related research and development
activities that improve the efficiency by which the radio spectrum is
used, and the ability of all Americans to access spectrum-related
services.\nEnergy and Power Management (EP) In the power electronics
realm, as CMOS chips go to finer lithography with each new generation,
their multiplying transistors require lower voltages and higher
currents. These trends have driven up power demands on printed circuit
boards and placed constant pressure on power-supply and power-system
developers to increase the efficiency and power or current density. At
the same time, the trends toward lower voltages and higher currents have
 encouraged migration from centralized to distributed and portable power
 architectures.\nEP1. Electronic Devices, Boards and Interfaces Newer
chips with lower supply-voltage requirements has greatly complicated
power-system and power-supply design. Innovations in the areas of
low-power device design and manufacturing as well as printed circuit and
 other boards that will operate at lower power and longer lifetimes are
welcome.\nEP2. Sustainable Energy Harvesting, Storage and Management -
Device and System Level Proposals are solicited in the areas of
electronic systems for portable energy sources for mobile technologies
and off-grid type applications, including new energy sources. Proposals

super-capacitors as well as smart power demand-response management
systems are welcome. Proposals with ideas on nature-inspired processes
for sustainable energy solutions and carbon storage, reducing the carbon
 and resource intensity of hydrocarbon extraction, energy conversion,
and its uses are sought. Innovative projects may include new critical
devices, components, and systems for energy harvesting and conversion
from renewable resources (excluding solar technologies). Refer to PH
topic for solar technologies.\nEP3. Smart Grids and Infrastructure

smaller size and power factor corrections are encouraged.\nRobotics and
Human Assistive Technologies (RH) Considerable progress will be made if
robots possessed the high intelligence needed to cope with uncertainty,
learn from experience, and work as a team. Robot designers are borrowing
 features from insect nervous systems, and engineers and computer
scientists collaborate with biologists, neuroscientists, and
psychologists to exploit new knowledge in the study of the brain and
behavior. Some robots will help people do what they can't or would
rather not do. Other robots will tackle complex projects by working as
teams. Robots will help protect critical infrastructure and monitor the
environment as mobile, intelligent sensors. High-performance processors,

pre-clinical or clinical-stage drug candidates or medical devices, or
work performed primarily for regulatory purposes. Limited studies with
human subjects may be acceptable to the extent that they are performed
in support of feasibility, proof-of-concept studies of early-stage
technologies. Proposals that request support for clinical studies will
be deemed non-compliant with the SBIR\/STTR solicitations.  BM1.
Pharmaceutical Manufacturing  Proposed projects must include new
processing or manufacturing devices, components, and systems that will
improve the efficiency, competitiveness, and output of the nation's
pharmaceutical manufacturing sector; that will reduce the cost, risk,
and time-to-market of new pre-clinical and clinical-stage drugs and
biological products; or that address major market opportunities in the
developing world. Proposed projects may include transformative
approaches and methods in manufacturing operations, project management,
process development, process engineering, analytical development, or
quality control and assurance. Proposals are strongly encouraged to
address the net preservation and extension of natural resources, a
reduction in the use or release of toxic or harmful constituents, the
use of less extreme temperatures or conditions, or a reduction in the
production of waste.   BM2. Materials for Biomedical Applications

biomaterials. Novel polymeric materials, polymers, plastics, additives,
sealants, elastomers, textiles, alloys, ceramic and composite
biomaterials, improved implants; coatings for therapeutic applications;
or nanomaterials.  BM3. Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine
Proposed projects may include enabling engineering and manufacturing
approaches, technologies and systems that will advance the research,
development, quality control, and production of artificial tissues and
their derivatives in scientific, therapeutic, or commercial
applications. Proposed projects may also include novel methods or
technologies to replace or regenerate damaged or diseased animal or
human cells, tissues, or organs to restore or establish their normal
function.  BM4. Biomedical Engineering Proposed project should focus on
using engineering approaches to develop transformative methods and
technologies that will solve problems in medicine. Proposed projects may
 include devices and systems that provide new strategies for the
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health conditions; advance
end-of-life or palliative care; reduce drug counterfeiting; and enable
new and more efficient risk-management methods to better address safety
issues of drugs and medical devices; motion or structural biomechanic
technologies for the improvement of human motion, and sensors,
actuators, and intelligent systems for surgical robotics. Proposers are
encouraged to form an interdisciplinary team that includes relevant
engineering as well as biology\/health-related expertise.  BM5.
Noninvasive Imaging of Brain Function  Proposed projects may include
novel, noninvasive technologies and instrumentation for imaging the
structure and function of the in vivo human brain. Proposed projects
should focus on developing engineering, multidisciplinary, or
multi-modality noninvasive brain imaging tools that could overcome
current limitations of existing techniques (such as, for example,
constraints on subject motion during imaging, requirements for elaborate
 electromagnetic shielding from the environment, requirements for active
 cooling of imaging system sensors, and system resolution that is much
coarser -millimeter to centimeter scale- than that required to detect
activity corresponding to individual neuronal signaling). Projects may
also be aimed at developing new data processing techniques or approaches
 to data interpretation. Technologies not aimed at brain imaging must be
 submitted under subtopic BM6.  BM6. Medical Imaging Technologies
Proposed projects may include (but are not limited to) novel or improved
 imaging technologies and\/or imaging agents to advance the diagnosis
and treatment of disease, and to improve prognosis. Technologies aimed

        "description": "\n\tGlucagon, GLP-1 and GIP are related peptides
 that target G-protein coupled receptors with effects on glucose and
lipid homeostasis.&amp;nbsp; Glucagon concentrations can be elevated in
diabetes due to dysregulation of glucagon secretion, while the
pancreatic beta-cell can be resistant to the insulinotropic effects of
the incretins, both contributing to hyperglycemia.&amp;nbsp; GLP-1
mimetics are in widespread use to treat diabetes, and a number of
glucagon and GIP receptor antagonists and agonists have also been tested
 as hypoglycemic agents.&amp;nbsp; Despite the widespread interest in
the therapeutic potential of this family of hormones, research regarding
 their interaction to regulate islet hormone secretion and on other
target tissues is hampered through lack of reproducible assays and
widely distributed peptide, small molecule and antibody
reagents.\n\n\tThe ability to study glucagon secretion, plasma levels
and biological activity in response to diet, physical activity, diurnal
rhythms, body composition, disease (particularly diabetes) and drug
treatment is limited due to nonspecificity of typically used
radioimmunoassays.&amp;nbsp; Commercially available ELISA assays have
improved the ability to monitor changes in glucagon over time in people
and animals, but more specific assays with improved accuracy and
reproducibility would make it easier to do cross-sectional comparisons
and to monitor small changes in glucagon, or detect it in small volumes
of blood.\n\n\tRecent publications have highlighted the complexity of
the roles for glucagon and incretins, and the cellular pathways
activated by signaling through their receptors, indicating the need for
greater understanding of the biology, physiology and potential clinical
relevance. &amp;nbsp;As an example, new dual and triple agonists for the
 glucagon, GIP and GLP-1 receptors show effectiveness in improving beta
cell function and mass in diabetes, casting light on the complexity of
the interaction of these receptors. Recent appreciation of the
differential roles of glucagon in the liver, adipose and brain suggests
that ligands that target specific tissues would be highly
useful.&amp;nbsp; Although several chemical classes of glucagon receptor
 antagonists\/inverse agonists have been reported, these compounds are
not readily available to the broad scientific community. The increased
availability of such ligands would provide tools to understand further
the role of glucagon and signaling through the glucagon receptor as well
 as enhance the study of the pharmacology of the small molecule ligands
themselves.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tStudies in which the glucagon receptor has
been inhibited or genetically ablated show pancreatic islet alpha-cell
hyperplasia, increased glucagon secretion and increased exocrine
growth.&amp;nbsp; Mechanisms for these observations are not well known,
and badly needed research depends on widely distributed high quality,
validated reagents for manipulating the receptor in central and
peripheral tissues, and for elucidating alpha cell biology.\n\n\tThe
unambiguous identification of incretin receptor-expressing cells in
humans and animal species is critically important knowledge for fully
understanding the biological effects, clinical benefits, and any side
effects of treatment with incretin agonists (in particular GLP-1
receptor agonists). &amp;nbsp;In addition to the pancreas, GIP and GLP-1
 receptors have been found in the intestine, stomach, kidney, lungs,
heart, and brain.&amp;nbsp; However, the accurate localization of
incretin receptor expression, especially in normal and diabetic human
pancreas, is challenging because most of the current commercially
available antisera used for detection of GLP-1 and GIP receptor
expression by immunohistochemical techniques and Western blotting often
are neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific to yield reliable data.
&amp;nbsp;The necessary validation assays for these reagents (antisera)
are sometimes omitted. &amp;nbsp;This represents an important problem in
 terms of the reliability, validity and reproducibility of the published
 experimental data and their interpretation.\n\n\tThis FOA invites Small
 Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant applications from small
business concerns for funding to perform research leading to the
development of validated, highly sensitive, and specific assays for
plasma glucagon; for development and\/or wide commercial distribution of
 reagents for manipulation of glucagon receptor activity in the islet,
brain and peripheral tissues; for reagents to be used to improve our
understanding of pancreatic alpha-cell biology particularly in response
to glucagon and incretins; and for reagents and assays for the accurate
expression and quantitation of functional incretin receptors in the
endocrine\/exocrine cells of the pancreas and relevant extrapancreatic
tissues.\n\n\tExamples of projects that this announcement encourages
include but is not limited to: &amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\tDevelop, validate,
and\/or manufacture highly specific, accurate assays for glucagon, for
use with human and mouse plasma.&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tDevelop and\/or
provide for wide commercial distribution peptides, small molecules or
antibodies that can be used to manipulate glucagon receptor
activity.&amp;nbsp; These may be specific for different tissues such as
islet cells, liver, adipose and brain.\n\t\n\t\tDevelop and validate
reagents and assays useful for the study of alpha-cell biology,
regulation, function, regeneration and plasticity, particularly in
response to manipulation of the glucagon and incretin receptors in
obesity and diabetes.\n\t\n\t\tDevelop highly specific and sensitive
poly- and monoclonal antibodies for the identification of incretin
receptors in tissues.\n\t\n\t\tDevelop reliable validation
methods\/assays to verify the sensitivity and specificity of incretin
receptor reagents.\n\t\n\t\tDevelop novel probes and in situ ligands to
improve the detection and quantitation of mRNA and protein expression of
 functional incretin and glucagon receptors.\n\t\n\t\tDevelop

        "description": "\n\tResearch Objectives\n\n\tThe high demand for
 improved rapid tests and POC diagnostics for oral infections and
cancers is driven by the burden of oral diseases globally.&amp;nbsp; To
improve patient care and stem disease epidemics, there is a need to
bring rapid, robust and highly accurate diagnosis to all at risk
populations.&amp;nbsp; Enhanced diagnostics could save, extend and
improve lives.&amp;nbsp; Nevertheless, early diagnosis and rapid
treatment initiation face challenges due to the lack of clinical
diagnostic tools with better sensitivity and specificity than those
currently available.&amp;nbsp; The goal of this SBIR FOA is to support
research to develop the next-generation of rapid tests and POC
diagnostic devices.&amp;nbsp; These tools must use oral biospecimens for
 detecting oral pathogens and biomarkers of associated oral diseases,
for screening, monitoring and diagnosing these diseases, including those
 linked to HIV\/AIDS.&amp;nbsp; The ultimate goal is to produce highly
reliable, reproducible, specific and sensitive tools.&amp;nbsp; These
new methods must demonstrate superior technical performance compared
with current technologies while not increasing costs and minimizing the
invasiveness of specimen collection from patients.&amp;nbsp;
Specifically, this FOA will stimulate research to:\n\n\t\n\t\tDevelop,
optimize and validate the next-generation of rapid tests and POC devices
 for oral pathogen detection, to serve purposes of primary or
confirmatory screening, monitoring disease progression, or diagnosing
oral diseases caused by oral viruses, bacteria and
fungi\n\t\n\t\tDevelop, optimize and validate POC devices for clinical
diagnosis of oral diseases in resource-limited settings without the use
of adjunctive laboratory equipment\n\t\n\t\tFocus on diagnostic
technologies that can detect more than one oral pathogen at a
time\n\t\n\t\tUtilize optimal visual formats for unambiguous test
results that are reliably transferred electronically to central
databases, and that use the appropriate controls\n\t\n\t\tDevelop tests
to: a) measure HIV persistence and residual reservoirs in oral cells
from HIV infected individuals under antiretroviral therapy; and b)
distinguish and quantify changes between replication-competent HIV and
integrated provirus in oral cells&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\tThe expected outcome
of this initiative will be the production of the next-generation of oral
 biospecimen-based rapid tests and POC devices for detecting oral
pathogens and biomarkers of associated diseases to facilitate screening,
 monitoring, or diagnosing oral diseases, including those associated
with HIV\/AIDS.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tPrompt clinical care in oral
medicine relies on early disease diagnosis that is often based on the
detection of an etiological agent, or disease biomarker present in an
oral biospecimen.&amp;nbsp; Diagnostic tests that have additional
clinical utility would be simple and robust enough to detect diseases
outside of traditional healthcare settings.&amp;nbsp; Such tests could
be administered in resource poor places where populations gather and
could be effectively screened.&amp;nbsp; The goal of this FOA is to
promote research to improve the sensitivity, specificity and robustness
of existing assays.&amp;nbsp; Its goal also is to create the next
generation of methodologies needed to enhance rapid diagnosis, primary
or confirmatory screening and monitoring of oral diseases.&amp;nbsp;
This FOA will also support new assays for HIV, including those to detect
 HIV latency, persistence and reactivation in oral cells as well as its
associated oral infectious comorbidities.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe rapid tests
 and POC devices that have the greatest clinical utility are those that
show the following characteristics:\n\n\t\n\t\tRequire minimal
laboratory equipment and involve few steps and
handling\n\t\n\t\tRepresent low costs\n\t\n\t\tInvolve easy to use
procedures\n\t\n\t\tRequire noninvasive or minimally invasive collection
 of oral biospecimens\n\t\n\t\tDeliver reliable and electronically
transferable results promptly and securely\n\t\n\t\tHave optimized
capacity for multiplex detection of oral pathogens and disease
biomarkers&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\tIn addition, oral biospecimen-based rapid
tests and POC devices offer the advantage of serving special populations
 such as children and the elderly, or in clinical situations when
standard volumes of blood typically used in commercial assays cannot be
obtained.\n\n\tThe success of the &amp;ldquo;test and treat&amp;rdquo;
clinical approach to manage the HIV epidemic depends on the development
and application of state-of-the-art emerging technologies.&amp;nbsp; For
 example, while substantial advances have been made in developing and
applying rapid diagnostic tools for HIV, more progress is needed for
equally rapid diagnosis of AIDS-related infectious
comorbidities.&amp;nbsp; Yet, some of these infectious comorbidities
such as oral candidiasis, caused by Candida albicans, and HPV-associated
 oral cancer, seem to persist in some populations regardless of
treatment status. &amp;nbsp;Further, the situation is less clear for the
 rapid diagnosis of agents such as KSHV, the etiological agent for oral
and systemic Kaposi&amp;rsquo;s sarcoma; EBV, causing Hairy Leukoplakia;
 and HSV, inducing Oral Ulceration.&amp;nbsp; For these agents that
latently persist in oral cells, pathogen detection is insufficient to
diagnose the associated oral diseases.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, measuring
changes in viral load thresholds through rapid tests and POC devices is
necessary to quickly tie them with pathology, disease development,
clinical manifestations, progression and the subsequent remission upon
effective treatment.\n\n\tExamples of Research Considered within the
Scope of this FOA\n\n\tThis FOA will support research projects that may
include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n\t\n\t\tDeveloping
rapid diagnostic tests and POC devices that could be used in settings
outside the traditional clinic for initial screening and monitoring of
pathogens and biomarkers linked to oral diseases\n\t\n\t\tApplying
nanotechnologies that: a) use nanomaterials, microfluidics and
chip-based diagnostics; b) include algorithms to perform diverse assays
on a single platform; c) improve oral fluid-based assay sensitivity and
specificity; d) maximize miniaturization in POC device design;
and\/or\n\t\n\t\te) include high-throughput multiplex detection of
pathogens and biomarkers for oral diseases\n\t\n\t\tDeveloping novel,
rapid tests and POC devices to: a) detect a low copy number of nucleic
acids for replication competent pathogens in latently infected oral
cells; b) quantify pathogen persistence; and\/or c) measure pathogen
reactivation in oral reservoirs\n\t\n\t\tDeveloping, standardizing and
validating rapid diagnostic tools and POC devices to reliably measure
oral pathogens and surrogate biomarkers indicative of responses to
therapeutic strategies, drug resistance and adherence to
treatment\n\n\n\tThis FOA will NOT support research projects that
include the following:\n\n\t\n\t\tProjects proposing clinical
trials.&amp;nbsp; Applicants who wish to conduct clinical trials must
use the R34 \/ U01 mechanism under the NIDCR Clinical Trials Program
(see
http:\/\/www.nidcr.nih.gov\/Research\/DER\/ClinicalResearch\/ClinTrials.htm)\n\t\n\t\tRapid
 tests and POC devices that propose using non-human oral biospecimens
and disease biomarkers to model oral diseases in humans\n\t\n\t\tRapid
tests and POC devices that do not use oral biospecimens and biomarkers
for oral diseases or that the main focus is the clinical diagnosis of
systemic diseases in humans\n\t\n\t\tTests and POC devices that utilize
only biomarkers or surrogate markers of oral diseases without including

personalized care in the clinic and\/or at home and promote
wellness\/health in persons with disabilities across the
lifespan.&amp;nbsp; Assistive rehabilitation robotic software and\/or
hardware system development of interest include, but are not limited to
those that:\n\n\t\n\t\tReduce the secondary health effects that follow
reduced mobility such as obesity, joint contracture,
etc.\n\t\n\t\tEstablish optimal patient specific rehabilitation, such as
 programs designed to establish timing intensity and duration of
interventions,\n\t\n\t\tSupport of life-long cognitive, social, and
physical disorders requiring on-going behavioral
therapy,\n\t\n\t\tProvide personalized care for special needs
populations, and\n\t\n\t\tIncrease wellness\/ health promotion and
maintenance.\n\n\n\tThe NIH is still interested in supporting robotic
advancements for surgical health interventions and robotic exoskeletons;
 however, these topics are not responsive to this
solicitation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n",

atomic, and molecular levels in order to provide the foundations for new
 energy technologies and to support DOE missions in energy, environment,
 and national security.&amp;nbsp; The results of BES\u2010supported
research are routinely published in the open literature.A key function
of the program is to plan, construct, and operate premier scientific
user facilities for the development of novel nanomaterials and for
materials characterization through x\u2010ray and neutron scattering;
the former is accomplished through five Nanoscale Science Research
Centers and the latter is accomplished through the world's largest suite
 of light source and neutron scattering facilities.&amp;nbsp; These
national resources are available free of charge to all researchers based
 on the quality and importance of proposed nonproprietary experiments. A
 major objective of the BES program is to promote the transfer of the
results of our basic research to advance and create technologies
important to Department of Energy (DOE) missions in areas of energy
efficiency, renewable energy resources, improved use of fossil fuels,
the mitigation of the adverse impacts of energy production and use, and
future nuclear energy sources.&amp;nbsp; The following set of technical
topics represents one important mechanism by which the BES program
augments its system of university and laboratory research programs and
integrates basic science, applied research, and development activities
within the DOE. For additional information regarding the Office of Basic

Applications:&amp;nbsp; YES Accepting SBIR Fast\u2010Track
Applications:&amp;nbsp; YES Accepting STTR Phase I
Applications:&amp;nbsp; YES Accepting STTR Fast\u2010Track
Applications:&amp;nbsp; YES &amp;nbsp;To achieve energy security and
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction objectives, the United States
must develop and deploy clean, affordable, domestic energy sources as
quickly as possible. Nuclear power will continue to be a key component
of a portfolio of technologies that meets our energy goals.&amp;nbsp;
Nuclear Energy R&amp;amp;D activities are organized along four main
R&amp;amp;D objectives that address challenges to expanding the use of
nuclear power: (1) develop technologies and other solutions that can
improve the reliability, sustain the safety, and extend the life of
current reactors; (2) develop improvements in the affordability of new
reactors to enable nuclear energy to help meet the Administration's
energy security and climate change goals; (3) develop sustainable
nuclear fuel cycles; and (4) understanding and minimization of risks of
nuclear proliferation and terrorism.&amp;nbsp; To support these
objectives, the Department of Energy is seeking to advance engineering
materials for service in nuclear reactors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Grant
applications are sought in the following subtopics:&amp;nbsp; a.
Specialty Steels and Alloys Grant applications are sought to develop
improvements in radiation\u2010resistant, high\u2010temperature steels
and alloys with practical applications for Generation IV reactor
systems, such as high\u2010temperature gas\u2010 or liquid\u2010cooled
systems at 400\u2010850\u00b0C.&amp;nbsp; In general, this will be
interpreted to mean that those materials which have improved creep
strength can be formed and joined, are compatible with one or more high
temperature reactor coolants, and could reasonably be expected to
eventually receive ASME Section III qualification for use in nuclear
construction.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact: William
Corwin, william.corwin@nuclear.energy.gov &amp;nbsp;b. Ceramic
Composites&amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought to develop improved
design and fabrication methods targeted at reducing cost and\/or
allowing joining of nuclear\u2010grade SiC\u2010SiC composites that can
be used in the Generation IV gascooled and liquid fluoride
salt\u2010cooled reactors at temperatures up to 850\u00b0C.&amp;nbsp;
Additional consideration will be given to proposals for SiC\u2010SiC
materials and forms that are also compatible for use as fuel cladding.
&amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact: William Corwin,
william.corwin@nuclear.energy.gov&amp;nbsp;c. In Situ Mitigation and
Repair of Materials Degradation&amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought
to develop technologies for the in situ mitigation and repair of
materials degradation in Light Water Reactor systems and components, in
order to extend the service life of current light water reactors.
Approaches of interest include new techniques for the repair of
materials degradation in metals, concrete, and cables; and methods that
can mitigate irradiation and aging effects in existing reactors and
components. &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact: Sue Lesica,

Department is particularly interested in forefront advances in imaging
techniques that combine molecular\u2010scale spatial resolution and
ultrafast temporal resolution to explore energy flow, molecular
dynamics, breakage, or formation of chemical bonds, or conformational
changes in nanoscale systems.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Grant applications are
 sought in the following subtopics: a. High Spatial Resolution Ultrafast
 Spectroscopy &amp;nbsp;Chemical information associated with
molecular\u2010scale processes is often available from optical
spectroscopies involving interactions with electromagnetic radiation
ranging from the infrared spectrum to x\u2010rays.&amp;nbsp; Ultrafast
laser technologies can provide temporally resolved chemical information
via optical spectroscopy or laser\u2010assisted mass sampling
techniques.&amp;nbsp; These approaches provide time resolution ranging
from the breakage or formation of chemical bonds to conformational
changes in nanoscale systems but generally lack the simultaneous spatial
 resolution required to analyze individual molecules.&amp;nbsp; Grant
applications are sought that make significant advancements in spatial
resolution towards the molecular scale for ultrafast spectroscopic
imaging instrumentation available to the research scientist.&amp;nbsp;
The nature of the advancement may span a range of approaches including
sub\u2010diffraction limit illumination or detection, selective
sampling, and coherent or holographic signal
analysis.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013
Contact: Larry Rahn, larry.rahn@science.doe.gov&amp;nbsp;b.
Time\u2010Resolved Chemical Information from Hybrid Probe Microscopies
&amp;nbsp;Probe microscopy instruments (including AFM and STM) have been
 developed that offer spatial resolution of molecules and even chemical
bonds.&amp;nbsp; While probe\u2010based measurements alone do not
typically offer the desired chemical information on molecular
timescales, methods that take advantage of electromagnetic interactions
or sampling with probe tips have been demonstrated.&amp;nbsp; Grant
applications are sought that would make available to scientists new
hybrid probe instrumentation with significant advancements in chemical
and temporal resolution towards that required for molecular scale
chemical interactions.&amp;nbsp; The nature of the advancement may span a
 range of approaches and probe techniques, from tip\u2010enhanced or
plasmonic enhancement of electromagnetic spectroscopy\u2019s to
probe\u2010induced sample interactions that localize spectroscopic
methods to the molecular scale.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Applications:&amp;nbsp; NO &amp;nbsp;Separation technologies recover,
isolate, and purify products in virtually every industrial process.
Using membranes rather than conventional energy intensive technologies
for separations could dramatically reduce energy use and costs in key
industrial processes [1]. Separation processes represent 40 to 70
percent of both capital and operating costs in industry. They also
account for 45 percent of all the process energy used by the chemical
and petroleum refining industries every year. In response the Department
 of Energy supports the development of high\u2010risk, innovative
membrane separation technologies and related materials. Many challenges
must be overcome before membrane technology becomes more widely adopted.
 Technical barriers include fouling, instability, low flux, low
separation factors, and poor durability. Advancements are needed that
will lead to new generations of organic, inorganic, and ceramic
membranes. These membranes require greater thermal and chemical
stability, greater reliability, improved fouling and corrosion
resistance, and higher selectivity leading to better performance in
existing industrial applications, as well as opportunities for new
applications. Materials for energy efficiency include both organic and
inorganic types. Their applications can be for supporting structures,
such as durable sealing materials to increase reliability of hydrogen
storage or for electronics substrates.&amp;nbsp; They also include
materials that are key to highly pure hydrogen. Finally, conductor
materials that promise 50% or more improvement in energy efficiency are
examined.&amp;nbsp; Grant applications are sought in the following
subtopics:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; a. High Selectivity Membranes
&amp;nbsp;This subtopic is focused on the advancement of manufacturing
processes that are able to produce membranes with exceptional
selectivity for separations.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;High
performance membranes offer the potential to provide game\u2010changing
process energy advances.&amp;nbsp; Specifically we are interested in
chemical separations, desalination, and gas separations.&amp;nbsp; Of
greatest interest are methods that employ strong, thin membranes (e.g.,
covalently bonded, one\u2010molecule\u2010thick structures) for high
permeance, with atomically precise pores for high selectivity.&amp;nbsp;
 In desalination, a rate increase of 2\u20103 orders of magnitude over
reverse osmosis is projected for a system with not only controlled pore
size but also engineered pore edge composition [1].&amp;nbsp; In
principle, a series of membranes of sufficient selectivity could
separate air into its raw components of N2, O2, Ar, CO2, Ne, He,
etc.&amp;nbsp; for significant energy savings in a wide range of
chemical and combustion processes [2, 3], and for greenhouse gas
reduction.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We seek grant applications to
advance scalable technologies that provide order\u2010of\u2010magnitude
increments over the performance of current industrial separation
processes.&amp;nbsp; The focus of the application must be on significant
 improvements in uniformity of pore size distribution and composition
for near 100% selectivity.&amp;nbsp; Consideration should be given to
addressing the other barriers cited in this topic:&amp;nbsp; fouling,
instability, flux, durability, and cost.&amp;nbsp; The choice of
membrane material should be appropriate to the target separation in a
commercial setting.&amp;nbsp; Target separations with high energy impact
 are preferred.&amp;nbsp; As a deliverable, a minimum of 50% energy
savings over separations in current commercial practice shall be
demonstrated through the manufacture of exemplar parts or materials,
with sufficient experimental measurements and supporting calculations to
 show that cost\u2010competitive energy savings can be achieved with
practical economies of scale.&amp;nbsp; The application should provide a
 path to scale up in potential Phase II follow on work.

&amp;nbsp;This subtopic is focused on methods to enhance the thermal and
 electrical conductivity of commercial metals.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;Electrical and thermal conductivity are thermophysical
properties of metals that play key roles in the energy efficiency in
many applications.&amp;nbsp; In general, we seek to increase both
properties but are limited by competing material requirements such as
strength and oxidation resistance.&amp;nbsp; High electrical
conductivity, strong aluminum would address transmission losses
(0.2\u20100.4 quads) and reduce total ownership costs in high voltage
power transmission lines.&amp;nbsp; High electrical conductivity
aluminum could replace copper for wiring and motor lightweighting in
certain aircraft and automotive systems.&amp;nbsp; High conductivity
copper could improve the efficiency of electric motors and reduce the
weight of aircraft and automobiles.&amp;nbsp; Improving the thermal
conductivity of steels and superalloys would improve the efficiency of
high temperature processes (including power generation) through high
performance heat exchangers, and would reduce material
requirements.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;There are several new approaches,
which have seen mixed degrees of technical success but no significant
commercial inroads due to cost or scalability:&amp;nbsp; multifunctional
 metal\/polymer composites, nanocarbon infusion processes, severe
plastic deformation of aluminum, and metal matrix composites.&amp;nbsp;
Specific challenges include establishing a quality interface between the
 metal and high conductivity material (such as carbon nanotubes) in
metal matrix composites, and minimizing defects that reduce conductivity
 in the highly conductive material [1\u20104].
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;We seek
grant applications to advance scalable technologies that provide at
least a 50% increment over the performance of commercial metal
conductors.&amp;nbsp; The improvement can be in electrical conductivity
or thermal conductivity either on a volumetric or weight
basis.&amp;nbsp; The choice of metallurgical system should be
appropriate to the target component in a commercial setting.&amp;nbsp;
Consideration should be given to addressing all aspects of the materials
 design at the system level (cost, corrosion and oxidation resistance,
joining and fabrication procedures, strength, fatigue, hardness,
ductility).&amp;nbsp; Industrial uses of the enhanced conductors that
will result in high energy impact are preferred.&amp;nbsp; As a
deliverable, a minimum of 50% energy savings in service over current
commercial practice shall be demonstrated through the manufacture of
exemplar components or materials, with sufficient experimental
measurements and supporting calculations to show that
cost\u2010competitive energy savings can be achieved with practical
economies of scale.&amp;nbsp; The application should provide a path to
scale up in potential Phase II follow on work. &amp;nbsp; Questions
\u2013 Contact: David Forrest, david.forrest@hq.doe.gov&amp;nbsp;c. Fuel
 Cell Membranes Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells are a
leading candidate to power zero emission vehicles, with several major
automakers already in the early stages of commercializing fuel cell
vehicles powered by PEM fuel cells.&amp;nbsp; PEM fuel cells are also of
 interest for stationary power applications, including primary power,
backup power, and combined heat and power.&amp;nbsp; Commercial PEM
technology typically is based on perfluorosulfonic acid ionomers, but
these ionomer materials are expensive, particularly at the low volumes
that will be needed for initial commercialization.&amp;nbsp;
Non\u2010PFSA PEMs, including those based on hydrocarbon membranes,
represent a lower\u2010cost alternative, but relatively low performance
and durability has limited non\u2010PFSA PEM applications to date.
Development of novel hydrocarbon ionomers and PEMs suitable for
application in PEM fuel cells is solicited through this
subtopic.&amp;nbsp; Novel PEMs developed through this subtopic should
have properties and characteristics required for application in PEM fuel
 cells, including:

 Chemical and mechanical durability sufficient to pass the accelerated
stress tests in the Fuel Cell Tech Team Roadmap [1] &amp;nbsp;The goal
of any proposed work under this subtopic should be to produce a PEM that
 can meet all of the technical targets in the table below. PEM
technology proposed for this subtopic should be based on
proton\u2010conducting non\u2010perfluorinated ionomers, but may include
 reinforcements or other additives.&amp;nbsp; Membrane samples should be
 tested at an independent laboratory at the end of each phase.&amp;nbsp;
 Phase 1 should include measurement of chemical and physical properties
to demonstrate feasibility of meeting the targets below related to these
 parameters, while Phase 2 addresses long term durability and
development of manufacturing processes to meet the cost
targets.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

 Overview&amp;nbsp;Office of Basic Energy SciencesThe Office of Basic
Energy Sciences (BES) supports fundamental research to understand,
predict, and ultimately control matter and energy at the electronic,
atomic, and molecular levels in order to provide the foundations for new
 energy technologies and to support DOE missions in energy, environment,
 and national security.&amp;nbsp; The results of BES\u2010supported
research are routinely published in the open literature. &amp;nbsp;A key
 function of the program is to plan, construct, and operate premier
scientific user facilities for the development of novel nanomaterials
and for materials characterization through x\u2010ray and neutron
scattering; the former is accomplished through five Nanoscale Science
Research Centers and the latter is accomplished through the world's
largest suite of light source and neutron scattering
facilities.&amp;nbsp; These national resources are available free of
charge to all researchers based on the quality and importance of
proposed nonproprietary experiments. &amp;nbsp; A major objective of the
 BES program is to promote the transfer of the results of our basic
research to advance and create technologies important to Department of
Energy (DOE) missions in areas of energy efficiency, renewable energy
resources, improved use of fossil fuels, the mitigation of the adverse
impacts of energy production and use, and future nuclear energy
sources.&amp;nbsp; The following set of technical topics represents one
important mechanism by which the BES program augments its system of
university and laboratory research programs and integrates basic
science, applied research, and development activities within the DOE.

Applications:&amp;nbsp; YES Accepting STTR Fast\u2010Track
Applications:&amp;nbsp; NO &amp;nbsp;For the foreseeable future, the
energy needed to sustain economic growth will continue to come largely
from hydrocarbon fuels. Advanced Fossil Energy technologies must allow
the Nation to use its indigenous fossil energy resources more wisely,
cleanly, and efficiently. These include R&amp;amp;D activities required
to reduce the capital and operating cost and to meet zero emission
targets in power systems (e.g., turbines, fuel cells, hybrids, novel
power generation cycles), coal conversion (e.g., gasification) and
beneficiation, advanced combustion (e.g., oxy\u2010combustion, chemical
looping, ultra super critical steam), hydrogen and fuels, and beneficial
 re\u2010use of CO2. This topic addresses grant applications for the
development of innovative, cost effective technologies for improving the
 efficiency and environmental performance of advanced large scale
industrial and utility fossil energy power generation and natural gas
recovery systems. The topic serves as a bridge between basic science and
 the fabrication and testing of new technologies. Small scale
applications, such as residential, commercial and transportation will
not be considered. Generally, electrochemical (SOFC excepted), microwave
 and plasma processes will not be considered due to high energy
requirements. Applications determined to be outside the mission or not
mutually beneficial to the Fossil Energy and Basic Energy Sciences
programs will not be considered. Grant applications are sought in the
following subtopics: &amp;nbsp;a. Shale Gas Conversion to Liquid Fuels
and Chemicals With the discovery of vast quantities of natural gas
available in various shale gas formations in the U.S. comes the
opportunity to convert this gas, traditionally used directly as fuel,
into more value added products. Traditionally, petroleum has been used
to make ethylene, propylene and other building blocks used in the
production of a wide range of other chemicals. We need to develop
innovative processes that can readily make these chemical intermediates
from natural gas.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The methane fraction can be
converted into intermediates such as ethylene via oxidative coupling or
reforming to synthesis gas, whereas the ethane\/propane fraction can be
converted into ethylene via conventional steam pyrolysis. Since methane
is rather inert and requires high temperatures to activate strong
chemical bonds, practical and cost\u2010effective conversion
technologies are needed. Attempts to develop catalysts and catalytic
processes that use oxygen to make ethylene, methanol, and other
intermediates have had little success as oxygen is too reactive and
tends to over\u2010oxidize methane to common carbon dioxide.&amp;nbsp;
Recent advances with novel sulfide catalysts have more effectively
converted methane to ethylene, a key intermediate for making chemicals,
polymers, fuels and , ultimately products such as films, surfactants,
detergents, antifreeze, textiles and others. &amp;nbsp;Proposals are
sought to develop novel and advanced concepts for conversion of shale
gas to chemicals based on advanced catalysts. Processes must have high
selectivity and yield compared to existing state of the art. Proposals
must be novel and innovative and show clear economic advantages over the
 existing state of the art.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013
Contact: Doug Archer, douglas.archer@hq.doe.gov&amp;nbsp;b. Additive
Manufacturing for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Components Additive
manufacturing (AM) which is used to create components in a layering
manner to achieve intricate final shape products has been identified as a
 potentially attractive option for the manufacture of high temperature
performance components used in SOFC technology in order to address the
need for components processing that not only maintains structural
integrity but also offers the ability to perform multiple functions as
well. AM also enables the design and synthesis of materials whose
microstructure and properties allow for the construction of such
components.&amp;nbsp; Due to the limitations in terms of spatial control
 and high reproducibility of microstructures involving traditional
screen printing, slurry pasting, and dip coating methods, there has been
 of late an increasing interest in inkjet printing and other
direct\u2010write additive processes. Grant applications are sought for
research and development to innovate AM techniques and to design and
generate SOFC structures and components with functionality and
characteristics that exceed the performance requirements of state of the
 art materials and manufacturing processes.&amp;nbsp; Approaches of
interest include, but are not limited to additive manufacturing
techniques to engineer preferred architectures or microstructure of a
material system that possesses enhanced physical, electrical and thermal
 properties for high temperature SOFC applications.&amp;nbsp; Techniques
 for SOFC interconnect coating and electrode infiltration are not of
interest.&amp;nbsp; A complete description of the manufacturing process
required to achieve the proposed architectures should be provided to
facilitate analysis of potential cost entitlements and implementation
complexity. Applications can focus on individual components; however, a
clear plan must be presented that outlines how entire SOFC cell or stack
 architectures would be fabricated, implemented, and perform.

patcharin.burke@netl.doe.gov&amp;nbsp;c. CO2 Capture from Low
Concentration SourcesDOE has a large program associated with capture
carbon from higher concentration CO2 sources including both coal
combustion and coal gasification units.&amp;nbsp; However, there are
other sources associated with coal power systems, resource recovery, and
 emissions mitigation where the concentration of the CO2 is smaller but
collectively these can represent a large quantity of CO2 emissions. In
response to the environmental concerns and prevailing market conditions
facing the coal industry, the DOE is seeking technologies to address CO2
 capture from coal\u2010related sources producing low concentration CO2
emissions.&amp;nbsp; Some technologies (materials and processes) may
have inherent advantages when capturing CO2 at these lower
concentrations.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought for
cost\u2010effective CO2 capture technologies that mitigate CO2 from coal
 relevant gases with CO2 concentrations of &amp;lt;1 vol% and also
highlight the size and relevance of the targeted low concentration
market.&amp;nbsp; The objective is to initiate R&amp;amp;D of applied
cost\u2010effective CO2 capture solutions for low concentration
(&amp;lt;1 vol%), coal\u2010relevant CO2 sources.&amp;nbsp; Technology
proposed in this topic area may include, but is not limited to:
coal\u2010relevant lifecycle GHG emissions such as those from mining
operations; approaches that are part of hybrid CO2 capture\/conversion
process and CO2 "polishing" steps that address the lower concentrations
of residual CO2 resulting from less than 100% capture.&amp;nbsp;
Applicants that have already identified a low CO2 concentration market
and successfully completed proof\u2010of\u2010concept analytical studies
 and simulations showing a pathway towards the aggressive Fossil Energy
performance goals either as part of earlier DOE or non\u2010DOE
supported efforts should apply.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013

Modifications to Existing Alloys that Promote Corrosion and \/ or
Erosion Resistance in Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Based Power Cycle
ApplicationsThere has been an increase in interest over the past several
 years in supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) cycles for power
generation. These cycles offer the potential for increased efficiency
over Rankine cycles with inherent capture of carbon dioxide using
oxy\u2010fuel combustion of natural gas or coal derived syngas as the
heat source.&amp;nbsp; The application of sCO2 cycles to commercial
power generation necessitates the development of new technologies in
several areas, especially materials that are used in high pressure and
temperature conditions under which sCO2 based power cycle applications
operate.&amp;nbsp; The severe conditions occurring at both high
pressures and temperatures up to 20\u201025 MPa and 550\u2010700\u00b0 C
 and higher, respectively can impose high levels of stress and severe
challenges to the integrity of materials that are used in the sCO2
system, especially in terms of corrosion and erosion
resistance.&amp;nbsp; Although many super alloys that are classified
into three main categories based on their major compositional element
(nickel\u2010, iron\u2010nickel\u2010, and cobalt\u2010base alloys) are
generally considered to be thermally stable at temperatures below
1500\u00b0C, little is known about material compatibility with CO2 under
 supercritical conditions. &amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought for
research and development to understand and develop corrosion and erosion
 resistance of sCO2 candidate materials in order to prevent unexpected
deterioration of components or decline in efficiency. Approaches of
interest include, but are not limited to investigations of:
&amp;nbsp;The effects of protective or non\u2010protective oxide layers
induced from additive alloying elements on corrosion and erosion
resistance of candidate materials and the corresponding dependence on
temperature and pressure at a range of operating conditions. &amp;nbsp;
The kinetics of oxide growth in an effort to build accurate models of
corrosion mechanisms in materials used in sCO2 applications in order to
predict corrosion and service life of alloys under relevant operational
conditions. &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact: Seth Lawson,

than the study of individual components. The Biological Systems Science
subprogram focuses on utilizing systems biology approaches to define the
 functional principles that drive living systems, from microbes and
microbial communities to plants and other whole organisms. Key questions
 that drive this research include: What information is encoded in the
genome sequence? How is information exchanged between different
sub\u2010cellular constituents? What molecular interactions regulate the
 response of living systems and how can those interactions be understood
 dynamically and predictively? The approaches employed include genome

Applications:&amp;nbsp; YES Accepting STTR Fast\u2010Track
Applications:&amp;nbsp; NO &amp;nbsp;The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) recently released its Fifth Assessment Report
(AR5), where it was reinforced that clouds and aerosols dominate
uncertainties in climate feedbacks associated with future climate
projections (Reference 1).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The mission of the
Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility is to
provide the climate research community with strategically located in
situ and remote sensing observations to improve the understanding and
representation, in climate and earth system models, of clouds and
aerosols as well as their interactions and coupling with the
Earth\u2019s surface.&amp;nbsp; The Atmospheric System Research (ASR)
program brings together ARM expertise in continuous remote sensing
measurements of cloud properties and aerosol influences on radiation
with the expertise of in situ characterization of aerosol properties,
evolution, and cloud interactions.&amp;nbsp; The goal of ASR, in
partnership with the ARM Facility, is to quantify the interactions among
 aerosols, clouds, precipitation, radiation, dynamics, and
thermodynamics to improve fundamental process\u2010level understanding,
with the ultimate goal to reduce the uncertainty in global and regional
climate simulations and projections (Reference 2). Measurements of
aerosol and cloud particles under a range of atmospheric conditions are
required to fully understand aerosol and cloud lifecycles, their
interactions, and their impact on the radiation budget. Innovative
measurement technologies are needed to provide this data, which is
necessary both for process understanding and for evaluation of numerical
 models that are used to assess the climate change impacts to global and
 regional systems.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Small aerial platforms, including
 unmanned aerial systems (UAS), tethered balloons, and kites, provide an
 innovative approach for making atmospheric measurements in conditions
that are logistically difficult for ground\u2010based measurements, that
 are too dangerous or cost\u2010prohibitive for manned aircraft, or
under operating conditions (e.g., slow airspeeds or low altitudes) that
are more difficult for large or manned platforms.&amp;nbsp; While small
aerial platforms are gaining increased use in the scientific, civil, and
 defense arenas, there is still a lack of sophisticated observing
capabilities for important aerosol, cloud, and associated meteorological
 state variables that have been miniaturized for deployment on such
platforms.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Grant applications are sought
for technology innovation in aerosol and cloud measurements to
capitalize on the increasing utility of UAS platforms for scientific
missions. Grant applications submitted to this topic must propose Phase I
 bench tests of critical technologies. (\u201cCritical
technologies\u201d refers to components, materials, equipment, or
processes that overcome significant limitations to current
capabilities.) In addition, grant applications should (1) describe the
purpose and benefits of any proposed teaming arrangements with
government laboratories or universities, and (2) support claims of
commercial potential for proposed technologies (e.g., endorsements from
relevant industrial sectors, market analysis, or identification of
potential spin\u2010offs). Grant applications proposing only computer
modeling without physical testing will be considered
non\u2010responsive.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Grant applications
are sought in the following subtopics:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;a. Aerosol
and Cloud\u2010Related Measurements from Small Aerial Platforms
Instrument packages developed to measure aerosol and cloud properties
have been successfully deployed from research aircraft in a wide range
of atmospheric conditions.&amp;nbsp; However, traditional instrument
packages typically are too large and heavy and\/or require too much
power to be used on small aerial platforms, such as UAS, tethered
balloons, or kites.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A need exists for instrument
packages capable of installation on a small aerial platform with
capabilities to measure properties of aerosols, cloud droplets, and\/or
glaciated hydrometeors. Grant applications are sought to develop
lightweight and low power (suitable for sampling from UAS, tethersonde,
or kite platforms) instruments for (1) cloud droplet\/drizzle
measurements (10\u20131000 \u03bcm size range), (2) accurate
measurements of liquid water content and\/or ice water content \u2013
techniques that distinguish phase of condensed water are high added
value, (3) accurate measurements of water vapor concentration and local
thermodynamic state that enable accurate calculation of relative
humidity and\/or supersaturation, (4) acquisition of
high\u2010resolution cloud particle images capable of distinguishing
size and habit of ice particles as well as droplets in mixed\u2010phase
clouds, (5) a fast spectrometer for measurement of cloud condensation
nuclei number concentrations over supersaturation ranges of the order
0.02% \u2013 1%, (6) a spectrometer\/counter for ice nuclei (IN) number
concentrations over effective local temperatures down to \u201038
\u00b0C, and (7) a nephelometer to measure aerosol scattering (nominal
wavelength 550 nm with a sensitivity of at least 1 M m\u20101;
additional wavelengths may be proposed). &amp;nbsp;Instruments must be
capable of operating on light\u2010weight airborne platforms such as
UAS\u2019s with little or no temperature or pressure controls.&amp;nbsp;
 We are particularly interested in instruments that weigh less than 6 kg
 and require less than 150 W of power. Questions \u2013 Contact: Rickey

 OverviewOffice of Biological and Environmental Research&amp;nbsp; The
Biological and Environmental Research (BER) Program supports
fundamental, peer\u2010reviewed research on complex systems in climate
change, subsurface biogeochemistry, genomics, systems biology, radiation
 biology, radiochemistry, and instrumentation. BER funds research at
public and private research institutions and at DOE laboratories. BER
also supports leading edge National Scientific User Facilities including
 the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI), the Environmental Molecular
Science Laboratory (EMSL), the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM)
Climate Research Facility and instrumentation for structural biology
research at the DOE Synchrotron Light and Neutron sources.&amp;nbsp; BER
 has interests in the following areas:&amp;nbsp;
1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Biological Systems Science integrates
discovery\u2010 and hypothesis\u2010driven science with technology
development on plant and microbial systems relevant to DOE bioenergy
mission needs. Systems biology is the multidisciplinary study of complex
 interactions specifying the function of entire biological
systems\u2014from single cells to multicellular organisms\u2014rather
than the study of individual components. The Biological Systems Science
subprogram focuses on utilizing systems biology approaches to define the
 functional principles that drive living systems, from microbes and
microbial communities to plants and other whole organisms. Key questions
 that drive this research include: What information is encoded in the
genome sequence? How is information exchanged between different
sub\u2010cellular constituents? What molecular interactions regulate the
 response of living systems and how can those interactions be understood
 dynamically and predictively? The approaches employed include genome
sequencing, proteomics, metabolomics, structural biology, high
resolution imaging and characterization, and integration of information
into predictive computational models of biological systems that can be
tested and validated.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The subprogram supports
operation of a scientific user facility, the DOE Joint Genome Institute
(JGI), and access to structural biology facilities at the DOE
Synchrotron Light and Neutron Sources. Support is also provided for
research at the interface of the biological and physical sciences and in
 radiochemistry and instrumentation to develop new methods for
real\u2010time, high\u2010resolution imaging of dynamic biological
processes.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The
Climate and Environmental Sciences subprogram focuses on a predictive,
systems\u2010level understanding of the fundamental science associated
with climate change and DOE\u2019s environmental challenges\u2014both
key to supporting the DOE mission. The subprogram supports an integrated
 portfolio of research from molecular level to field\u2010scale studies
with emphasis on multidisciplinary experimentation and use of advanced
computer models. The science and research capabilities enable DOE
leadership in climate\u2010relevant atmospheric\u2010process research
and modeling, including clouds, aerosols, and the terrestrial carbon
cycle; large\u2010scale climate change modeling; integrated analysis of
climate change impacts; and advancing fundamental understanding of
coupled physical, chemical, and biological processes controlling
contaminant mobility in the environment.&amp;nbsp; The subprogram
supports three primary research activities and two national scientific
user facilities.&amp;nbsp; Atmospheric System Research seeks to resolve
the two major areas of uncertainty in climate change model projections:
the role of clouds and the effects of aerosols on the atmospheric
radiation balance. &amp;nbsp;Environmental System Science supports
research that provides scientific understanding of the effects of
climate change on terrestrial ecosystems, the role of terrestrial
ecosystems in global carbon cycling, and the role of subsurface
biogeochemistry in controlling the fate and transport of
energy\u2010relevant elements.&amp;nbsp; Climate and Earth System
Modeling focuses on development, evaluation, and use of large scale
climate change models to determine the impacts of climate change and
mitigation options.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Two scientific user facilities
the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility
and the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) provide the
broad scientific community with technical capabilities, scientific
expertise, and unique information to facilitate science in areas
integral to the BER mission and of importance to DOE.&amp;nbsp;

Applications:&amp;nbsp; NO Accepting STTR Phase I
Applications:&amp;nbsp; YES Accepting STTR Fast\u2010Track
Applications:&amp;nbsp; NO &amp;nbsp;Reactive transport models are
increasingly used to model hydrobiogeochemical processes in complex
subsurface systems (soils, rhizosphere, sediments, aquifers and the
vadose zone) for many different applications and across a wide range of
temporal and spatial (e.g., pore to core to plot to watershed) scales.
With increasing computational capability it is possible to simulate the
coupled interactions of complex subsurface systems with high fidelity.
The predictive skill of these advanced models is limited, however, by
the accuracy of the parameters that are used to populate the models and
represent the system structure and intrinsic properties. Furthermore,
robust testing of these increasingly complex models requires high
fidelity measurements of the hydrobiogeochemical structure and
functioning of the complex subsurface systems over the relevant spatial
and temporal scales.&amp;nbsp; The focus of this topic is on the
development of improved sensing systems for capturing the in\u2010situ
hydrobiogeochemical structure and functioning of complex subsurface
systems because they serve as the substrate for natural, disturbed and
managed terrestrial vegetation systems.&amp;nbsp; Grant applications
submitted to this topic must describe why and how the proposed in situ
fieldable technologies will substantially improve the
state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art, include bench and\/or field tests to
demonstrate the technology, and clearly state the projected dates for
likely operational deployment. New or advanced technologies, which can
be demonstrated to operate under field conditions and can be deployed in
 2\u20103 years, will receive selection priority. Claims of relevance to
 field sites or locations under investigation by DOE, or of commercial
potential for proposed technologies, must be supported by endorsements
from relevant site managers, market analyses, or the identification of
commercial spin\u2010offs. Grant applications that propose incremental
improvements to existing technologies are not of interest and will be
declined. Collaboration with government laboratories or universities,
either during or after the SBIR\/STTR project, may speed the development
 and field evaluation of the measurement or monitoring technology. BER
funding to the National Laboratories is primarily through Scientific
Focus Areas (SFAs). The Subsurface Biogeochemical Research (SBR)
supported SFAs, and the field sites where they conduct their research,
are described at the following website:
http:\/\/doesbr.org\/research\/sfa\/index.shtml. The Terrestrial
Ecosystem Science (TES) program also supports several interdisciplinary
field research projects focused on carbon and nutrient cycling:
http:\/\/tes.science.energy.gov\/research\/ameriflux.shtml;
http:\/\/tes.science.energy.gov\/research\/criticalecosystems.shtml.
These field research sites may also be appropriate venues for testing
and evaluation of novel measurement and monitoring technologies.
Proposed plans to conduct testing at these DOE supported research sites
should be accompanied by a letter of support from the project PI. Grant
applications must describe, in the technical approach or work plan, the
purpose and specific benefits of any proposed teaming arrangements.
Grant applications are sought in the following subtopics: a.
Real\u2010Time, In Situ Measurements of Hydrobiogeochemical and
Microbial Processes in Complex Subsurface Systems Sensitive, accurate,
and real\u2010time monitoring of hydrobiogeochemical processes are
needed in subsurface environments, including soils, the rhizosphere,
sediments, the vadose\u2010zone and groundwaters. In particular, highly
selective, sensitive, and rugged in situ devices are needed for
low\u2010cost field deployment in remote locations, in order to enhance
our ability to monitor processes at finer levels of resolution and over
broader areas. Therefore, grant applications are sought to develop
improved approaches for the autonomous and continuous sensing of key
elements such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus in situ;
improved methods to measure and monitor dissolved oxygen, vertically
resolved soil moisture distributions, and groundwater age.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;The ability to distinguish between the relevant oxidation
states of redox sensitive elements such as iron, manganese, sulfur and
other inorganics is of particular concern. Innovative approaches for
monitoring multi\u2010component biogeochemical signatures of subsurface
systems is also of interest, as is the development of robust field
instruments for multi\u2010isotope and quasi\u2010real time analyses of
suites of isotope systems of relevance to hydrologic and biogeochemical
studies (e.g. 2H, 18O, CH4, CO2, nitrogen compounds, etc.).
&amp;nbsp;Grant applications must provide convincing documentation
(experimental data, calculations, and simulation as appropriate) to show
 that the sensing method is both highly sensitive (i.e., low detection
limit), precise, and highly selective to the target analyte, microbe or
microbial association (i.e., free of anticipated
physical\/chemical\/biological interferences). Approaches that leave
significant doubt regarding sensor functionality in realistic
multi\u2010component samples and realistic field conditions will not be
considered.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Grant applications also are sought to
develop integrated sensing systems for autonomous or unattended
applications of the above measurement needs. The integrated system
should include all of the components necessary for a complete sensor
package (such as micro\u2010machined pumps, valves, microsensors, solar
power cells, etc.) for field applications in the subsurface. Approaches
of interest include: (1) automated sample collection and monitoring of
subsurface biogeochemistry and microbiology community structure, (2)
fiber optic, solid\u2010state, chemical, or silicon micro\u2010machined
sensors; and (3) biosensors (devices employing biological molecules or
systems in the sensing elements) that can be used in the field \u2013
biosensor systems may incorporate, but are not limited to, whole cell
biosensors (i.e., chemiluminescent or bioluminescent systems), enzyme or
 immunology\u2010linked detection systems (e.g., enzyme\u2010linked
immunosensors incorporating colorimetric or fluorescent portable
detectors), lipid characterization systems, or DNA\/RNA probe technology
 with amplification and hybridization. Grant applications that propose
minor adaptations of readily available materials\/hardware, and\/or
cannot demonstrate substantial improvements over the current
state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art are not of interest and will be
declined.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact: David Lesmes,

 Overview&amp;nbsp;Office of Nuclear Physics&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Nuclear
 physics (NP) research seeks to understand the structure and
interactions of atomic nuclei and the fundamental forces and particles
of nature as manifested in nuclear matter.&amp;nbsp; Nuclear processes
are responsible for the nature and abundance of all matter, which in
turn determines the essential physical characteristics of the
universe.&amp;nbsp; The primary mission of the Nuclear Physics (NP)
program is to develop and support the scientists, techniques, and
facilities that are needed for basic nuclear physics research and
isotope development and production.&amp;nbsp; Attendant upon this core
mission are responsibilities to enlarge and diversify the Nation's pool
of technically trained talent and to facilitate transfer of technology
and knowledge to support the Nation's economic base.&amp;nbsp; Nuclear
physics research is carried out at national laboratories and accelerator
 facilities, and at universities.&amp;nbsp; The Continuous Electron Beam
 Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at the Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) allows detailed studies of how quarks and
gluons bind together to make protons and neutrons.&amp;nbsp; In an
upgrade currently underway, the CEBAF electron beam energy will be
doubled from 6 to 12 GeV.&amp;nbsp; The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is forming new states of
matter, which have not existed since the first moments after the birth
of the Universe; a beam luminosity upgrade is currently underway. NP is
supporting the development of a future Facility for Rare Isotope Beams
(FRIB) currently under construction at Michigan State
University.&amp;nbsp; The NP community is also exploring opportunities
with a proposed electron\u2010ion collider.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The NP
program also supports research and facility operations directed toward
understanding the properties of nuclei at their limits of stability, and
 of the fundamental properties of nucleons and neutrinos.&amp;nbsp; This
 research is made possible with the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator
System (ATLAS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) which provides
stable and radioactive beams as well as a variety of species and
energies; a local program of basic and applied research at the
88\u2010Inch Cyclotron of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
(LBNL); the operations of accelerators for in\u2010house research
programs at two universities (Texas A&amp;amp;M University and the
Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) at Duke University),
which provide unique instrumentation with a special emphasis on the
training of students; non\u2010accelerator experiments, such as large
standalone detectors and observatories for rare events.&amp;nbsp; Of
interest is R&amp;amp;D related to future experiments in fundamental
symmetries such as neutrinoless double\u2010beta decay experiments and
measurement of the electric dipole moment of the neutron, where
extremely low background and low count rate particle detections are
essential. Another area of R&amp;amp;D is rare isotope beam
capabilities, which could lead to a set of accelerator technologies and
instrumentation developments targeted to explore the limits of nuclear
existence.&amp;nbsp; By producing and studying highly unstable nuclei
that are now formed only in stars, scientists could better understand
stellar evolution and the origin of the elements. Our ability to
continue making a scientific impact on the general community relies
heavily on the availability of cutting edge technology and advances in
detector instrumentation, electronics, software, accelerator design, and
 isotope production.&amp;nbsp; The technical topics that follow describe
 research and development opportunities in the equipment, techniques,
and facilities needed to conduct and advance nuclear physics research at
 existing and future facilities.&amp;nbsp; For additional information

processing systems are needed to store, access, retrieve, distribute,
and process data from experiments conducted at large facilities, such as
 Brookhaven National Laboratory\u2019s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC) and the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility
(TJNAF).&amp;nbsp; In addition, data acquisition for the Facility for
Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) will require unprecedented speed and
flexibility in collecting data from the new flash ADC based
detectors.&amp;nbsp; Experiments at such facilities are extremely
complex, involving thousands of detector elements that produce raw
experimental data&amp;nbsp; at rates in excess of a GB\/sec, resulting
in the annual production of data sets of hundred Terabyte (100 TB) to
Petabyte (PB) scale.&amp;nbsp; Data sets of many 10s to 100s of TB are
currently distributed to institutions worldwide for analysis, and with
the increasing data generation rates seen at RHIC, PB scale datasets are
 anticipated. Research on the management of such large data sets, and on
 high speed, distributed data acquisition will be required to support
these large scale nuclear physics experiments.&amp;nbsp; All grant
applications should explicitly show relevance to the DOE nuclear physics
 program. In addition, applications should be informed by prior practice
 in nuclear physics applications, commercially available products, and
emerging technologies. We note that a proposal that advocates
incremental improvements or moderate levels of innovation may
nonetheless have an enormous impact in the right context. Such proposals
 must of course make their case convincingly, as they may otherwise be
considered non\u2010responsive. Grant applications are sought only in
the following subtopics:&amp;nbsp; a. Large Scale Data Processing and
Distribution &amp;nbsp;A trend in nuclear physics is to maximize the
availability of distributed storage and computing resources by
constructing end\u2010to\u2010end data handling and distribution
systems, using web services or data grid infrastructure software (such
as Globus, Condor or xrootd), with the aim of achieving fast data
processing and\/or increased data availability across many compute
facilities.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought for (1)
hardware and\/or software techniques to improve the effectiveness and
reduce the costs of storing, retrieving, and moving such large volumes
of data, including but not limited to automated data replication coupled
 with application\u2010level knowledge of data usage, data transfers to
Tier 2 and Tier 3 centers from multiple data provenance, to achieve the
lowest wait\u2010time or fastest data processing and maximal
coordination (2) effective new approaches to data mining or data
analysis through data discovery or restructuring (examples of such
approaches might include fast information retrieval through advanced
MetaData searches or in\u2010site data reduction, and repacking for
remote analysis and data access); (3) new tools for co\u2010scheduling
compute and storage resources for dataintensive high performance
computing tasks, such as user analyses in which repeated passes over
large datasets are needed, requiring fast turnaround times; and (4)
distributed authorization and identity management systems, enabling
single sign\u2010on access to data distributed across many
sites.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Proposed infrastructure software solutions
should consider and address the advantages of closely integrating
relevant components of Grid middleware, such as are contained in the
software stack of the Open Science Grid, as the foundation used by
nuclear physics and other science communities.&amp;nbsp; Applications
that propose data distribution and processing projects are encouraged to
 determine the relevance of and possible future migration strategies
into existing infrastructures, and to consider integrated solutions and
designs with capacities that would seamlessly include Grid and Clouds
computing resources, or help to transparently bridge between the two
worlds Clouds and Grids. &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact:
Manouchehr.farkhondeh@science.doe.gov. Also can contact the NP Topic
Associate (TA) listed at the beginning of the References section for
this topic. &amp;nbsp;b. Software\u2010Driven Network Architectures for
Data Acquisition &amp;nbsp;Modern data acquisition systems are becoming
more heterogeneous and distributed. This presents several new
challenges, and existing Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition
(SCADA) systems may no longer be applicable to these new large, dynamic,
 loosely\u2010coupled systems with increased reliability requirements
and high data rates. The building blocks of data acquisition system are
digitizers, either flash digitizers, or integrating digitizers of time,
pulse height or charge.&amp;nbsp; These elements are required to convert
 detector signals into a digital form in real time. The data from each
detector element is labeled with a precisely synchronized time, and
transmitted to buffers. The total charge, the number of coincident
elements, or other information summaries are used to determine whether
something interesting has happened, which constitutes a
trigger.&amp;nbsp; If justified by the trigger, the data from these
elements are assembled into a timecorrelated event for later analysis, a
 process called Event Building.&amp;nbsp; At present, these elements are
 typically connected by buses (VME, cPCI), custom interconnects, or
serial connections (USB).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;For physics
experiments at facilities such as RHIC, there is an increasing need for
real\u2010time decision making processing such as error correction and
recovery, as well as real\u2010time quality control.&amp;nbsp; Data
collection and device control would benefit greatly from scalable and
versatile control systems.&amp;nbsp; As the number of channels
increases, control systems based on EPICS and archiver systems cannot
provide the truly distributed and scalable infrastructures needed by
remote control rooms. One might instead consider a message queueing
paradigm as a possible architecture for meta\u2010data collection.
&amp;nbsp;In certain FRIB experiments, low event rates of 1 to 10
kevents\/sec are anticipated, with dense data streams from
FADC\u2010based detector systems.&amp;nbsp; The large latencies possible
 in highly buffered flash ADC architectures can be used to advantage in
the design of the architecture. An interesting possibility regarding the
 next generation of data acquisition systems is that they may ultimately
 be composed of separate ADCs for each detector element, connected by
commercial network or serial technology.&amp;nbsp; Implementation of
this distributed data acquisition over commercially available network
technologies such as Ethernet or Infiniband will require additional
development. One may for example develop a software architecture for a
system that works efficiently given available network bandwidth and
latencies.&amp;nbsp; Desirable features of this architecture will be to
(1) synchronize time across all channels to sufficient precision to
support&amp;nbsp; Flash Analog\u2010to\u2010Digital Converter (FADC)
clock synchronization (perhaps 10nsec or better), and to support trigger
 formation and event building (at least 100nsec or better); (2)
determine a global trigger from information transmitted by the
individual components; (3) notify the elements of a successful trigger,
in order to locally store the current information; (4) collect event
data from the individual elements to be assembled into events; and (5)
develop software tools to validate the synchronization, triggering, and
event building during normal operation.&amp;nbsp; Time synchronization
is critical to the success of this architecture, as is the concurrent
validation of synchronization. This architecture and its implementation
could form the basis of a standard for next\u2010generation data
acquisition in nuclear physics, particularly at FRIB.&amp;nbsp; It could
 be made available for integrating custom front end electronics, and
could also be integrated with various ADC and TDC components to form
complete commercial solutions.&amp;nbsp; It would be inherently
scalable, from small, early test stands of a single computer with an
appropriate network card, to large complex detectors.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;Applications are invited in the following areas; 1) the
development of data acquisition system and control systems above and
beyond the classic SCADA architecture; 2) soft core FPGA module(s) to
implement the network protocol for Ethernet and\/or Infiniband, able to
drive existing and emerging commercial network chips, with sufficient
buffering to support data aggregation using a commercial network switch,
 and with sufficient speed to drive 40 Gb\/sec network links; 3) time
distribution protocols and hardware to support fine\u2010grained time
tagging of each network packet for later correlation and event or frame
assembly, again with FPGA integration, and possibly exploiting the
commercial network for some aspects of tagging.&amp;nbsp;

Associate (TA) listed at the beginning of the References section for
this topic. &amp;nbsp;c. Heterogeneous Concurrent Computing
&amp;nbsp;Computationally demanding theory calculations as well as
detector simulations and data analysis tasks can be significantly
accelerated through the use of general purpose Graphics Processing Units
 (GPUs).&amp;nbsp; The ability to exploit these graphics accelerators is
 constrained by the effort required to port the software to the GPU
environment. More capable cross compilation or
source\u2010to\u2010source translation tools are needed that are able to
 convert very complicated templatized C++ code and into high performance
 codes for heterogeneous architectures.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Early work
by the USQCD (US Quantum Chromo Dynamics) collaboration has demonstrated
 the power of clusters of GPUs in Lattice QCD calculations.&amp;nbsp;
This early work was workforce intensive, but yielded a large return on
investment through the hand optimization of critical numerical kernels,
achieving performance gains of up to 60x with 4 GPUs. Utilizing High
Performance Computing (HPC) and Leadership Computing Facilities (LCFs)
is of growing relevance and importance to experimental NP as well. NP
codes written or rewritten to have the concurrency needed to perform
well on prevalent and emerging multi\u2010 and many core architectures
can potentially utilize HPC effectively. Experiments are increasingly
invited and encouraged to use such facilities, and DOE is assessing the
needs of computationally demanding experimental activities such as data
analysis, detector simulation, and error estimation in projecting their
future computing requirements. Tools and technologies that can
facilitate efficient use of HPCs and LCFs for the applications and
data\u2010intensive workflows characteristic of experimental NP are in
the scope of this subtopic. &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact:

 Overview&amp;nbsp;Office of Nuclear Physics&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Nuclear
 physics (NP) research seeks to understand the structure and
interactions of atomic nuclei and the fundamental forces and particles
of nature as manifested in nuclear matter.&amp;nbsp; Nuclear processes
are responsible for the nature and abundance of all matter, which in
turn determines the essential physical characteristics of the
universe.&amp;nbsp; The primary mission of the Nuclear Physics (NP)
program is to develop and support the scientists, techniques, and
facilities that are needed for basic nuclear physics research and
isotope development and production.&amp;nbsp; Attendant upon this core
mission are responsibilities to enlarge and diversify the Nation's pool
of technically trained talent and to facilitate transfer of technology
and knowledge to support the Nation's economic base.&amp;nbsp; Nuclear
physics research is carried out at national laboratories and accelerator
 facilities, and at universities.&amp;nbsp; The Continuous Electron Beam
 Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at the Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) allows detailed studies of how quarks and
gluons bind together to make protons and neutrons.&amp;nbsp; In an
upgrade currently underway, the CEBAF electron beam energy will be
doubled from 6 to 12 GeV.&amp;nbsp; The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is forming new states of
matter, which have not existed since the first moments after the birth
of the Universe; a beam luminosity upgrade is currently underway. NP is
supporting the development of a future Facility for Rare Isotope Beams
(FRIB) currently under construction at Michigan State
University.&amp;nbsp; The NP community is also exploring opportunities
with a proposed electron\u2010ion collider.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The NP
program also supports research and facility operations directed toward
understanding the properties of nuclei at their limits of stability, and
 of the fundamental properties of nucleons and neutrinos.&amp;nbsp; This
 research is made possible with the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator
System (ATLAS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) which provides
stable and radioactive beams as well as a variety of species and
energies; a local program of basic and applied research at the
88\u2010Inch Cyclotron of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
(LBNL); the operations of accelerators for in\u2010house research
programs at two universities (Texas A&amp;amp;M University and the
Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) at Duke University),
which provide unique instrumentation with a special emphasis on the
training of students; non\u2010accelerator experiments, such as large
standalone detectors and observatories for rare events.&amp;nbsp; Of
interest is R&amp;amp;D related to future experiments in fundamental
symmetries such as neutrinoless double\u2010beta decay experiments and
measurement of the electric dipole moment of the neutron, where
extremely low background and low count rate particle detections are
essential. Another area of R&amp;amp;D is rare isotope beam
capabilities, which could lead to a set of accelerator technologies and
instrumentation developments targeted to explore the limits of nuclear
existence.&amp;nbsp; By producing and studying highly unstable nuclei
that are now formed only in stars, scientists could better understand
stellar evolution and the origin of the elements. Our ability to
continue making a scientific impact on the general community relies
heavily on the availability of cutting edge technology and advances in
detector instrumentation, electronics, software, accelerator design, and
 isotope production.&amp;nbsp; The technical topics that follow describe
 research and development opportunities in the equipment, techniques,
and facilities needed to conduct and advance nuclear physics research at
 existing and future facilities.&amp;nbsp; For additional information

particular interest are innovative readout electronics for use with the
nuclear physics detectors described in Topic 24 (Nuclear
Instrumentation, Detection Systems, and Techniques).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 All grant applications must explicitly show relevance to the DOE
nuclear physics program. Additionally, applications must be informed by
prior art in nuclear physics applications, commercially available
products and emerging technologies A proposal based on incremental
improvements or little innovations, in the right context, can have an
enormous impact or value. Such a proposal must be convincing, otherwise
it will be considered as being non\u2010responsive. Grant applications
are sought only in the following subtopics:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;a.
Advances in Digital and High\u2010Density Analog Electronics
&amp;nbsp;Digital signal processing electronics are needed to replace
analog signal processing, following low noise amplification, in nuclear
physics applications. Grant applications are sought to develop high
speed digital processing electronics that improve the accuracy in
determining the position of interaction points (of particles or photons)
 to smaller than the size of the detector segments. Emphasis should be
on digital technologies with low power dissipation. &amp;nbsp;Questions

the NP Topic Associate (TA) listed at the beginning of the References
section for this topic. &amp;nbsp;b. Circuits &amp;nbsp;Grant
applications are sought to develop application\u2010specific integrated
circuits (ASICs), as well as circuits (including firmware) and systems,
for rapidly processing data from highly\u2010segmented,
position\u2010sensitive germanium detectors (pixel sizes in the range of
 1 mm\u00b2 to 1 cm\u00b2) and from particle detectors (e.g., gas
detectors, scintillation counters, silicon drift chambers, silicon pixel
 and strip detectors, silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), particle
calorimeters, and Cherenkov counters) used in nuclear physics
experiments.&amp;nbsp; Areas of specific interest include (1)
low\u2010noise preamplifiers, low\u2010noise filters, peak sensors,
timing sensors, analog storage devices, analog\u2010to\u2010digital and
time\u2010to\u2010digital converters, transient digitizers, and
time\u2010to\u2010amplitude converters; (2) front\u2010end, digitizing,

front\u2010end circuits, analog\u2010to\u2010digital converters,
extensive digital signal processing capability tailored to the
application, and standard digital interfaces and protocols for
compatibility with commercial devices.&amp;nbsp; These circuits should
be low\u2010power; low\u2010cost; high\u2010density; programmable to the
 possible extent; easy to use with commercial auxiliary electronics;
compact; and efficiently packaged for multi\u2010channel devices. Also
of interest are the following high performance detector readouts:
\u2022&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Multi\u2010channel Time to Digital Conversion front end ASIC
(conventional and radiation hard) for picosecond measurement resolution,
 over a wide timing range (~1\u201010 s).
\u2022&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Flash ADC using CMOS or superconducting electronics with sampling
frequency greater than 50 GHz and sampling depth of 1024\u20104096
(10\u201012 bits). &amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought for
microelectronics beyond the current state\u2010of\u2010art that
specifically target low\u2010noise amplification, digitization and smart
 on\u2010chip processing (triggering, neighboring, sparsification, data
reduction) of sensor\/detector signals, and that are suitable for next
generation detectors.&amp;nbsp; The microelectronics and associated
interconnections must be lightweight and have low power
dissipation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact:

Associate (TA) listed at the beginning of the References section for
this topic. &amp;nbsp;c. Advanced Devices and Systems &amp;nbsp;Grant
applications are sought for improved or advanced devices and systems
used in conjunction with the electronic circuits and systems described
in subtopics a and b:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
\u2022&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 Areas of interest regarding devices include (1) wide\u2010bandgap
semiconductors (i.e., semiconductor materials with bandgaps greater than
 2.0 electron volts, including Silicon Carbide (SiC), Gallium Nitride
(GaN), and any III\u2010Nitride alloys); (2) inhomogeneous
semiconductors such as SiGe; and (3) device processes such as
silicon\u2010on\u2010insulator (SOI) or silicon\u2010on\u2010sapphire

links, event handlers, multiple processors, trigger logics, and fast
buffered time and analog digitizers.&amp;nbsp; For detectors that
generate extremely high data volumes (e.g., &amp;gt;500 GB\/s), (2)
advanced high\u2010bandwidth data links are of
interest.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Grant applications also are
sought for generalized software and hardware packages, with improved
graphic and visualization capabilities, for the acquisition and analysis
 of nuclear physics research data.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013

Topic Associate (TA) listed at the beginning of the References section
for this topic. &amp;nbsp;d. Next Generation Pixel Sensors
&amp;nbsp;Active Pixel Sensors (APS) in CMOS (complementary
metal\u2010oxide semiconductor) technology have largely replaced Charge
Coupled Devices as imaging devices and cameras for visible
light.&amp;nbsp; Nuclear physics experiments at the Relativistic Heavy
Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory and at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN have developed and used APS devices as
direct conversion minimum ionizing particle detectors. The innermost
tracking detector of the STAR experiment at RHIC contains 356 million
(21x21x50 m) APS pixels. Future high luminosity colliders such as the
Electron Ion Collider (EIC) plan to operate at luminosities in the range
 1033\u20131035 cm\u20102 s\u20101 and will require radiation hard
tracking devices placed at radii below 10 cm. Therefore, cost effective
alternatives to the present generation high density APS devices will be
required. An ambitious goal is to develop extremely thin ~0.1% radiation
 length detector modules capable of high rate readout. In low energy
nuclear physics applications, the bulk silicon substrate is thicker and
is used as the active volume.&amp;nbsp; A major advance would be to
introduce an electric field into this drift region and to deplete it.
This would result in a much shorter collection time and negligible
charge dispersion allowing sensitivity to non\u2010minimum ionizing
particles, such as MeV\u2010range gamma rays. Grant applications also
are sought for the next generation of active pixel sensors, or even
strip sensors. Options may include integrated CMOS detectors which
combine initial signal processing and data sparsification on a standard
CMOS wafer; superconducting large area pixel detectors; novel 2D\u2010
and 3D\u2010pixel materials and geometry structure.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Associate (TA) listed at the beginning of the References section for
this topic. &amp;nbsp;e. Manufacturing and Advanced Interconnection
Techniques &amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought to develop (1)
manufacturing techniques for large, thin, multiple\u2010layer printed
circuit boards (PCBs) with plated\u2010through holes, dimensions from 2m
 x 2m to 5m x 5m, and thicknesses from 100 to 200 microns (these PCBs
would have use in cathode pad chambers, cathode strip chambers, time
projection chamber cathode boards, etc.); (2) techniques to add
plated\u2010through holes, in a reliable robust way, to large rolls of
metallized mylar or kapton (which would have applications in detectors
such as time expansion chambers or large cathode strip chambers); and
(3) miniaturization techniques for connectors and cables with 5 times to
 10 times the density of standard inter\u2010density
connectors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In addition, many
next\u2010generation detectors will have highly segmented electrode
geometries with 5\u20105000 channels per square centimeter, covering
areas up to several square meters.&amp;nbsp; Conventional packaging and
assembly technology cannot be used at these high densities.&amp;nbsp;
Grant applications are sought to develop (1) advanced microchip module
interconnect technologies that address the issues of high\u2010density
area\u2010array connections \u2013 including modularity, reliability,
repair\/rework, and electrical parasitics; (2) technology for
aggregating and transporting the signals (analog and digital) generated
by the front\u2010end electronics, and for distributing and conditioning
 power and common signals (clock, reset, etc.); (3) low\u2010cost
methods for efficient cooling of on\u2010detector electronics; (4)
low\u2010cost and low\u2010mass methods for grounding and shielding; and
 (5) standards for interconnecting ASICs (which may have been developed
by diverse groups in different organizations) into a single system for a
 given experiment \u2013 these standards should address the combination
of different technologies, which utilize different voltage levels and
signal types, with the goal of reusing the developed circuits in future
experiments.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Lastly, highly\u2010segmented detectors
 with pixels smaller than 100 microns present a significant challenge
for integration with frontend electronics.&amp;nbsp; New monolithic
techniques based on vertical integration and through\u2010silicon vias
have potential advantages over the current bump\u2010bonded
approach.&amp;nbsp; Grant applications are sought to demonstrate
reliable, readily\u2010manufacturable technologies to interconnect
silicon pixel detectors with CMOS front\u2010end integrated circuits. Of
 highest long term interest are high density high\u2010functionality 3D
circuits with direct bonding of high resistivity silicon detector layer
of an appropriate thickness (50 to 500 microns) to a 3D stack of thin
CMOS layers. The high resistivity detector layer would be fully depleted
 to enable fast charge collection with very low diffusion. The thickness
 of this layer would be optimized for the photon energy of interest or
to obtain sufficient signal from a minimum number of ionizing particles.

 Such a proposal must be convincing, otherwise it will be considered as

following subtopics:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;a. Materials and Components for
 Radio Frequency Devices &amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought to
improve or advance superconducting and room\u2010temperature materials
or components for RF devices used in particle accelerators.&amp;nbsp;
Areas of interest include (1) peripheral components, for both room
temperature and superconducting structures, such as ultra\u2010high
vacuum seals, terminations, high reliability radio frequency windows
using alternative materials (e.g., sapphire), ceramics that have good
dielectric properties such as a loss tangent better than 0.01% at 1 GHz

&amp;nbsp;Grant applications are also sought to develop new concepts of
dressed SRF cavities (SRF cavities equipped with He vessels and tuners)
with improved mechanical properties to mitigate He pressure
fluctuations, microphonics and Lorentz force
detuning.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Grant
applications also are sought to develop (1) improved superconducting
materials or processes applied to such material that have lower RF
losses, operate at higher temperatures, and\/or have higher RF critical
fields than sheet niobium. Approaches of interest involving atomic layer
 deposition (ALD) synthesis should identify appropriate precursors and
create high quality, NbN, Nb3Sn, or MgB2 films with anti\u2010diffusion
dielectric overlayers; and (2) techniques to create a layer of niobium
on the interior of a copper elliptical cavity, such as by energetic ion
deposition, so that the resulting 700\u20101500 MHz structures have
Q0&amp;gt;1 x 1010 at 2 K at operational fields.&amp;nbsp; Demonstration

superconducting resonators, including methods for electropolishing, high
 temperature treatments, laser or electron beam surface glazing of
niobium for surface purification and annealing in vacuum; and surface
coatings that enhance or stabilize performance parameters. Methods which
 avoid use of hydrofluoric acid are desirable. Surface conditioning
processes of interest should (1) yield microscopically smooth

niobium surfaces; and\/or (2) reliably remove essentially all surface
particulate contaminates (&amp;gt; 0.1 \u00b5m) from interior surfaces
of typical RF accelerating structures.&amp;nbsp; Grant applications

section for this topic. &amp;nbsp;b. Radio Frequency Power Sources
&amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought to develop designs and hardware

candidate technologies include:&amp;nbsp; solid\u2010state devices,
multi\u2010cavity klystrons, tunable\/phase stabilized magnetron,
Inductive\u2010Output Tubes (IOTs), or hybrids of those
technologies.&amp;nbsp; Emphasis is desirable on reduced power
consumption, bandwidth, ease of manufacture, mitigation of risk with RF
Device obsolescence and enhanced reliability measures. Grant
applications also are sought to develop computer software for the design
 or modeling of any of these devices; such software should be able to
faithfully model the complex shapes with full selfconsistency.&amp;nbsp;
 Software that integrates multiple effects, such as electromagnetic and
wall heating is of particular interest.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;Grant applications also are sought for a microwave power
device, klystron, IOT, tunable\/phase stabilized magnetron or solid
state amplifiers, especially class F devices, offering improved
efficiency (&amp;gt;70%) while delivering up to 12.5 kW, 50 kW or 500 kW
 CW at 952.6 MHz. The device must provide a high degree of backwards
compatibility, both in size and voltage requirements, to allow its use
as a replacement for the klystron (model VKL7811) presently used at
TJNAF, while providing significant energy savings.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought for highly efficient 844 MHz RF
amplifiers capable of producing in excess of 500 kW CW for the purpose
of powering super\u2010conducting accelerator cavities.

non\u2010superconducting, for the acceleration of beams in the velocity
regime between 0.001 and 0.03 times the velocity of light, and with
charge\u2010to\u2010mass ratios between 1\/6 and 1\/240; (2)
superconducting RF accelerating structures appropriate for rare isotope
beam accelerator drivers, for particles with speeds in the range of
0.02\u20100.8 times the speed of light; (3) innovative techniques for
field control of ion acceleration structures (0.1\u00ba or less of phase
 and 0.1% amplitude) and electron acceleration structures (0.1\u00ba of
phase and 0.01% amplitude) in the presence of 10\u2010100 Hz variations
of the structures\u2019 resonant frequencies (0.1\u20101.5 GHz); (4)
multi\u2010cell, superconducting, 0.4\u20101.5 GHz accelerating
structures that have sufficient higher\u2010order mode damping, for use
in energy\u2010recovering linac\u2010based devices with ~1 A of electron
 beam; (5) methods for preserving beam quality by damping
beam\u2010break\u2010up effects in the presence of otherwise
unacceptablylarge, higher\u2010order cavity modes \u2013 one example of
which would be a very high bandwidth feedback system; (6) development of
 tunable (up to 10\u20104) superconducting RF cavities for acceleration
and\/or storage of relativistic heavy ions; and (7) development of
rapidly tunable RF systems for applications such as non\u2010scaling
fixed\u2010field alternating gradient accelerators (FFAG) and rapid
cycling synchrotrons, either for providing high power proton beams.
&amp;nbsp;More specifically, RF cavities with high gain in voltage
&amp;gt;30 kV and fast frequency switching are of interest
forapplications in fast acceleration of non\u2010relativistic protons or
 ions with 0.1 &amp;lt; v\/c the goal is to create higher Q cavities
where the frequency between two cavities can vary up to
25%.&amp;nbsp;Grant applications also are sought to develop software for
 the design and modeling of the above systems.&amp;nbsp; Desired
modeling capabilities include (1) charged particle dynamics in complex
shapes, including energy recovery analysis; (2) the incorporation of
complex fine structures, such as higher order mode dampers; (3) the
computation of particle\u2010 and field\u2010induced heat loads on
walls; (4) the incorporation of experimentally measured 3\u2010D charge
and bunch distributions; and (5) and the simulation of the electron
cloud effect and its suppression. &amp;nbsp;A
high\u2010integrated\u2010voltage SRF cw crab crossing cavity is also of
 interest.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, grant applications are sought for (1)
designs, computer\u2010modeling, and hardware development for an SRF
crab crossing cavity with 0.4 to 1.5 GHz frequency and 3 to 50 MV
integrated voltage; and (2) beam dynamics simulations of an interaction
region with crab crossing.&amp;nbsp; One example of candidate
technologies would be a multi\u2010cell SRF deflecting
cavity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Finally, grant applications also
are sought&amp;nbsp; to develop and demonstrate low level RF system
control algorithms or controlhardware that provide a robust and adaptive
 environment suitable for any accelerator RF system.&amp;nbsp; Of
special interest are approaches that address the particular challenges
of superconducting RF systems, but room temperature systems are of
interest as well.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013

&amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought to develop (1) particle beam ion
 sources and\/or associated components with improved intensity,
emittance, and range of species; (2) methods and\/or devices for
reducing the emittance of relativistic ion beams \u2013 such as coherent
 electron cooling, electron bunched\u2010beam cooling, and electron or
optical\u2010stochastic cooling; (3) methods and devices to increase the
 charge state of ion beams (e.g., by the use of special
electron\u2010cyclotron\u2010resonance ionizers, electron\u2010beam
ionizers, or special stripping techniques);&amp;nbsp; (4) methods and
\/or devices for improving emission capabilities of photocathode
sources, such as improving charge lifetime, bunch charge, average
current, emittance, or energy spread; (5) techniques for in situ coating
 of elliptical and other surface contour RF cavities and long beam pipes
 with thick superconducting films; (6) novel methods for in situ surface
 cleaning (scrubbing) of ultrahigh vacuum long narrow tubes and
elliptical cavities to reduce secondary electron yield and outgassing;
(7) novel, robust coatings to passivate conductance limited beam pipe
for UHV operation to reduce thermal and stimulated outgassing;&amp;nbsp;
 (8) high brightness electron beam sources utilizing continuous wave
(cw) superconducting RF cavities with integral photocathodes operating
at high acceleration gradients; (9) techniques and devices for measuring
 RF resistivity of cryogenically cooled coated tubes; and (10) CW
superconducting or normal\u2010conducting RF cavity(s) that integrate
with photocathode or field emitting cathodes such as micro\u2010tips or
carbon nanotubes.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 &amp;nbsp;Accelerator techniques for an energy recovery linac (ERL)
and\/or a circulator ring (CR) based electron cooling facility for
cooling medium to high energy bunched proton or ion beams are of high
interest for next generation colliders for nuclear physics experiments.
&amp;nbsp;Therefore, grant applications are sought for&amp;nbsp; (1)
design, modeling and proto\u2010type development for a magnetized
electron source\/injector with a high bunch charge (up to 2 nC), up to 1
 ns bunch length, high average current (above 200 mA) and high bunch
repetition rate ( 20 to 500 MHz); (2) designs, modeling, and hardware
and component development for a fast beam\u2010switching kicker with 0.5
 ns duration and 10 to 20 kW power in the range of 5\u201050 MHz
repetition rate; (3) optics designs and tracking simulations of beam
systems for ERLs&amp;nbsp; and&amp;nbsp; CRs, with energy range from 5
to 130 MeV; (4) designs, modeling, and hardware and component
development for understanding the effects of passage through targets and
 solenoidal magnetic fields on energy recovery, and beam
characteristics,&amp;nbsp; (5) transporting and matching magnetized
beams with superconducting solenoids in cooling channels; (6) study of
synchrotron radiation and its impact on beam dynamics in ERLs and CRs;
and (7) development of new concepts for high\u2010energy,
high\u2010power electron beam dumps that minimize activation of
surrounding structures.&amp;nbsp; Examples of candidate technologies
include photocathode or thermionic electron guns with a DC or RF
accelerating structure; SRF deflecting cavity, pulse compression
techniques, and beam\u2010based kicker.&amp;nbsp; Grant applications
also are sought to develop computer software for the design, modeling
and simulating any of these devices and beam transport
systems.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought to
develop beam absorbers for energy\u2010recovery linac driven medical
isotope facilities. In such facilities an energy\u2010recovering
electron beam interacts with a thin high\u2010Z target. After
interaction with the thin target, the beam halo generated must be
deposited in a controlled way and absorbed downstream of the target but
before substantial bending for energy recovery. High efficiency in beam
absorption leads to higher electron beam current and to higher possible
overall production rates in the facility.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Grant
applications are sought for the development of alkali\u2010antimonide
photocathodes that exhibit high quantum efficiency and robust
long\u2010lifetime operation while delivering high average current beams
 (milliamperes) when used inside dc high voltage or rf photoguns. These
cathodes should be optimized to achieve high electron beam brightness,
ideally in the presence of strong electric fields.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
We envision a commercial product line of photocathodes grown on
substrates compatible with load locked gun designs used at a variety of
national laboratories. &amp;nbsp;Lastly, grant applications are sought
to develop software that adds significantly to the
state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art in the simulation of beam
physics.&amp;nbsp; Areas of interest include (1) electron cooling,
including software product for start to end simulations of coherent
electron cooling, including both microbunching and FEL concepts, (2)
intra\u2010beam and interbeam scattering, (3) spin dynamics, (4)
polarized beam generation including modeling of cathode geometries for
high current polarized electron sources, (5) generating and transporting
 polarized electron beam, (6) beam dynamics, transport and
instabilities, (7) electron or plasma discharge in vacuum under the
influence of charged beams, (8) simulation of space\u2010charge tune
shift and tune spread in stored ion beams, (9) beam\u2010beam effects in
 colliders; and (9) non\u2010relativistic space charge and its influence
 on ring dynamics.&amp;nbsp; The software should use modern best
practices for software design, should run on multiple platforms, and
should run in both serial and parallel configurations.&amp;nbsp; Such
product should be easy to use and provide visualization. There is
particular interest in porting accelerator modeling codes to the GPU,
Xeon Phi, and other emerging architectures. Grant applications also are
sought to develop graphical user interfaces for problem definition and
setup.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact:

&amp;nbsp;With respect to polarized sources, grant applications are
sought to develop (1) polarized&amp;nbsp; hydrogen and deuterium
(H\u2010\/D\u2010) 3He sources and\/or associated&amp;nbsp; components
with polarization above 90%; (2) cw polarized electron sources and\/or
associated&amp;nbsp; components delivering beams of ~50 mA, with
longitudinal polarization greater than 80%;&amp;nbsp; (3) devices,
systems, and sub\u2010systems for producing variable\u2010helicity beams
 of&amp;nbsp; electrons with polarizations greater than 80% and currents
 &amp;gt; 200 microamps , that have very small helicity\u2010correlated
changes in beam intensity, position, angle, and
emittance.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Grant applications also are
sought to develop (1) methods to improve high voltage stand\u2010off and
 reduce field emission from high voltage electrodes, compatible with
ultra\u2010high\u2010vacuum environments; (2) wavelength\u2010tunable
(700 to 850 nm) mode\u2010locked lasers, with pulse repetition rate
between 0.5 and 3 GHz and average output power &amp;gt;10 W; and (3) a
cost\u2010effective means to obtain and measure vacuum below 10\u201012
Torr.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Grant applications also are sought
for (1) advanced software and hardware to facilitate the manipulation
and optimized control of the spin of polarized beams; (2) advanced beam
diagnostic concepts, including new beam polarimeters and polarimeter
targets and fast reversal of the spin of stored, polarized beams; (3)
absolute polarimeters for spin polarized 3He beams with energies up to
160 GeV\/nucleon (4) novel concepts for producing polarizing particles
of interest to nuclear physics research, including electrons, positrons,
 protons, deuterons, and 3He; and (5) credible sophisticated computer
software for tracking the spin of polarized particles in storage rings
and colliders. &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact:

&amp;nbsp;The following simulation studies are of interest:&amp;nbsp;
(1) simulation of the interaction of an intense heavy ion beam with the
media used in charge strippers; (2) simulation of the effect of the
heavy ion beam on a liquid lithium film used as a charge stripper; and
(3) simulation of a He gas stripper with counter flows perpendicular to
the heavy ion beam in order to study the heating effect and density
variations effects on energy spread. Study of the film stability with
high power density deposition is also of interest. Thin foils are also
desirable as windows for gas targets and as photon taggers used in
conjunction with Megawatt electron beams for fundamental nuclear physics
 experiments. &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact:

&amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought to develop (1)&amp;nbsp; ion
sources for radioactive beams, (2) techniques for secondary radioactive
beam collection, charge equilibration, and cooling; (3) technology for
stopping energetic radioactive ions in helium gas and extracting them
efficiently as high\u2010quality low\u2010energy ion beams; (4) advanced
 parallel\u2010computing simulation techniques for the optimization of
both normal\u2010 andsuper\u2010conducting accelerating structures for
the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), and (5) High\u2010rate (~107
 pps) position, angle and timing tracking detectors for fast heavy ion
beams (50\u2010250 MeV\/u)... &amp;nbsp;Grant applications also are
sought to develop fast\u2010release solid catcher materials.&amp;nbsp;
The stopping of highenergy (&amp;gt;MeV\/u) heavy\u2010ion reaction
products&amp;nbsp; in solid catchers is important for realizing
high\u2010intensity low\u2010energy beams of certain elements and for
the parasitic use of rare isotopes produced by projectile
fragmentation.&amp;nbsp; The development of suitable
high\u2010temperature materials to achieve fast release of the stopped
rare isotopes as atomic or single\u2010species molecular vapor is
required &amp;nbsp;Grant applications also are sought to develop
techniques for efficient rare isotope extraction from water.&amp;nbsp;
Water\u2010filled beam dumps or reaction product catchers, considered in
 the context of high\u2010power rare isotope beam production, could
provide a source for the harvesting heavy\u2010ion reaction products
stopped in the water.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Grant
applications also are sought to develop techniques for the charge
breeding of rare isotopes in Electron Beam Ion Sources or Traps
(EBIS\/T) prior to reacceleration. High breeding efficiencies in single
charge states and short breeding times are required. In order to be able
 to optimize these values, simulation tools will be needed that
realistically describe electron\u2010ion interaction and ion cooling
mechanisms and use accurate electric and magnetic field models. Also
high performance electron guns with well\u2010behaved beam compression
into the magnetic field of the EBIS\/T will be required. The electron
guns will have to be optimized for high perveance and multi\u2010Ampere
electron current output in order to optimize ion capacity, ion beam
acceptance and breeding times.&amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought
for development of radiation tolerant or radiation resistant multipole
inserts in large\u2010aperture superconducting quadrupoles used in
fragment separators. Sextupole and octupole coils with multipole fields
of up to 0.4 T are required to operate in a 2\u2010T quadrupole field.
Minimum cold mass and all\u2010inorganic construction are requirements
that may be partially met with High Temperature Superconducting (HTS)
coils or conventional superconductors with non\u2010standard
insulation.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought for
development of radiation resistant thermal isolation systems for
superconducting magnets. Support links connecting room temperature with
the liquid helium structure have to support large magnetic forces, but
at the same time have low thermal conductivities to limit heat input.
Typically, all\u2010metal links have ten to twenty times higher heat
leaks than composite structures. Composites are, however, hundreds or
thousands of times more sensitive to radiation damage than metals and so
 cannot be used in the high\u2010radiation environment surrounding the
production target or beam dump areas of high\u2010power heavy ion
accelerators. Given the high cost of cryogenic refrigeration,
development of radiation resistant, high\u2010performance support links
is very desirable. &amp;nbsp;Lastly, grant applications are sought to
develop advanced and innovative approaches to the construction of large
aperture superconducting and\/or room temperature magnets and\/or
associated components, for use in fragment separators and magnetic
spectrographs at rare isotope beam accelerator facilities.&amp;nbsp;
Grant applications also are sought for special designs that are
applicable for use in high radiation areas.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;(Additional needs for high\u2010radiation applications can be
found in subtopic f \u201cTechnology for High Radiation
environments\u201d of Topic 24, Nuclear Physics Detection Systems,
Instrumentation and Techniques.) &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact:

Associate (TA) listed at the beginning of the References section for

&amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought to develop (1) advanced beam
diagnostics concepts and devices that provide high speed
computer\u2010compatible measurement and real\u2010time monitoring and
readout of particle beam intensity, position, emittance, polarization,
luminosity, momentum profile, time of arrival, and energy (including
such advanced methods as neural networks or expert systems such as those
 employing genetic algorithms, and techniques that are nondestructive to
 the beams being monitored); (2) beam diagnostic devices that have
increased sensitivities through the use of superconducting components
(for example, filters based on high Tc superconducting technology or
Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices); (3) measurement
devices\/systems for cw beam currents in the range 0.1 to 100 \u00b5A,
with very high precision (&amp;lt;10\u20104) and short integration
times; (4) beam diagnostics for ion beams with intensities less than 107
 nuclei\/second; (5) non\u2010destructive beam diagnostics for stored
proton\/ion beams, such as at the RHIC, and\/or for 100 mA class
electron beams; (6) devices\/systems that measure the emittance of
intense (&amp;gt;100kW) cw ion beams, such as those expected at FRIB;
(7) beam halo monitor systems for ion beams; (8) instrumentation for
electron cloud effect diagnostics and suppression, and (9) new beam
diagnostics enabled by non\u2010traditional bulk materials such as
diamond, graphene, other thin\u2010film and nano\u2010structured
materials. &amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought for the development
of triggerable, high speed optical and\/or IR cameras, with associated
MByte\u2010scale digital frame grabbers for investigating time dependent
 phenomena in accelerator beams. Image capture equipment needs to
operate in a high\u2010radiation environment and have a frame capture
rate of up to 1 MHz. Imaging system needs to have memory capacity at the
 level of 1000 frames (10 GByte or higher total memory
capacity).&amp;nbsp; The cameras will be used for high\u2010speed
analysis of optical transition or optical diffraction radiation
data.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought for developing
point of delivery beam bunch length monitors for the Jefferson Lab CEBAF
 accelerator. Beam energies are from 6\u201012 GeV and bending magnets
are available to produce synchrotron radiation. Non\u2010invasive
monitoring is preferred. 500 MHz beam currents are typically above 5 uA
and bunch lengths are typically below 30 microns rms. &amp;nbsp;Grant
applications also are sought for \u201cintelligent\u201d software and
hardware to facilitate the improved control and optimization of charged
particle accelerators and associated components for nuclear physics
research.&amp;nbsp; Areas of interest include the development of (1)
generic solutions to problems with respect to the initial choice of
operation parameters and the optimization of selected beam parameters
with automatic tuning; (2) systems for predicting insipient failure of
accelerator components, through the monitoring\/cataloging\/scanning of
real\u2010time or logged signals; and (3) devices that can perform
direct 1214 bit digitization of signals at 0.5\u20102 GHz and that have
bandwidths of 100+ kHz. &amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought to
develop wire scanners for profile measurement of high intensity charged
particle beams. The application of new materials that may survive
exposure to such beams is especially encouraged. For example, BNNT fiber
 is known for its high temperature stability but has not been used in an
 accelerator application. The resultant fiber should have a diameter
smaller than 50 microns and be sufficiently stable to be
self\u2010supported over a gap of 2 centimeters. Carbon fiber wires and
Tungsten wires do not survive high intensity beams similar to CEBAF,
SLAC LCLS and\/or CERN LHC. &amp;nbsp;Grant applications are sought to
develop beam diagnostic instrumentation based on High Temperature
Superconducting materials. Examples include low noise non\u2010invasive
beam monitors for current, position, and polarization of charged
particle beams in accelerators. The instrumentation should be capable of
 measuring sub\u2010nano amp beam properties with msec or better
integration times. &amp;nbsp;Control System Studio (CS\u2010Studio) is
an Eclipse\u2010based collection of tools to monitor and operate large
scale control systems, such as the ones in the accelerator community. It
 is a product of the collaboration between Facility for Rare Isotope
Beams, Spallation Neutron Source, and National Synchrotron Light Source
II.&amp;nbsp; One of the primary concerns with CS\u2010Studio remains
its reliance on the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT), used by the Eclipse
Rich Client Platform which offers a look and feel similar to the running
 platform. Unfortunately this approach has also resulted in SWT having a
 rather limited widget set whose functionality and ease of use are
significantly compromised by the need to be supported on all
platforms.&amp;nbsp; JavaFX represents a potential replacement for SWT
in CS\u2010Studio. As part of the JDK version 7, it comes with complex
widgets and interactions.&amp;nbsp; Grant applications are sought to
develop: (1) graphical editor framework to enable data visualization and
 creation of synoptic displays.&amp;nbsp; (2) runtime environment \u2010
 an extendable framework to process and display real time data that
supports control system protocols (EPICS v3, v4), web services, and
integration patterns.&amp;nbsp; The model would remove the close
coupling with specific technologies like Eclipse\u2019s Graphical
Editing Framework, while utilizing JavaFX and web\u2010related
technologies. &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact:

Associate (TA) listed at the beginning of the References section for
this topic. &amp;nbsp;i. Magnet Development for Future Electron\u2010Ion
 Colliders (EIC) &amp;nbsp;One of the options under consideration for
EIC is based on the Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) architecture for the
electron beam. The ERL requires return passes \u2010 beam lines for
electrons to be brought back to the linac during acceleration and
deceleration.&amp;nbsp; After collisions with ions the highest energy
electrons are decelerated by going through the linac with an opposite RF
 voltage. The beam lines could be built of permanent magnets to reduce
the overall cost. In addition if the magnets are designed for use in a
NonScaling Fixed Field Alternating Gradient structure they can transfer
multiple energies within the same aperture. Grant applications are
sought to (1) manufacture prototype magnets using a permanent magnetic
material. They can be either quadrupoles or focusing\/defocusing
combined function magnets. The same type of structure could be used for
the proton cancer therapy gantries where the 30\u2010250 MeV protons
would be delivered under different angles to the patients. There is also
 a strong interest in the proton cancer therapy for this type of gantry
as it simplifies the treatment due to the fixed magnetic field and due
to reduction of the magnet size and weight. &amp;nbsp;A full utilization
 of the discovery potential of a next\u2010generation electron\u2010ion
collider requires a fullacceptance detection system that can provide
detection of reaction products scattered at small angles with respect to
 the incident beams over a wide momentum range. Grant applications are
sought for design, modeling and hardware development of the special
magnets for such a detection system. Magnets of interest include (1)
radiation\u2010resistant superconducting (\u2265 2 T pole\u2010tip
field) septum dipole with electronically adjustable field orientation
(+\/\u2010 100 mrad); (2) radiation\u2010resistant high\u2010field
(\u2265 9 T pole\u2010tip field), large\u2010aperture (\u2265 20 cm
radius) quadrupole; (3) radiation\u2010resistant superconducting (\u2265
 6 T pole\u2010tip field) large\u2010aperture (\u2265 20 cm radius)
small\u2010yoke\u2010thickness (\u2264 14 cm OD\u2010ID) quadrupole; (4)
 radiationresistant super\u2010conducting (\u2265 6 T pole\u2010tip
field, ~3 cm IR) combined\u2010function magnet with quadrupole and
independently adjustable horizontal and vertical dipole field
components. &amp;nbsp;High\u2010performance, low\u2010cost,
low\u2010energy\u2010consumption magnets and systems are of great
importance for feasibility of future accelerator facilities. Grant
applications are sought for design, simulation and prototyping of such
magnets and systems allowing for peak fields of greater than 3 T, field
quality better than ~10^\u20104 within ~3 cm aperture radius, high ramp
rate of greater than 1 T\/s, lower power consumption than conventional
room\u2010temperature magnets, and significantly lower cost than
conventional cos\u2010theta superconducting magnets. Examples include
superferric dipoles and\/or quadrupoles, power supplies, cryogenic
systems, manufacturing techniques, etc. applicable in future
large\u2010scale accelerator projects such as an electron\u2010ion
collider. &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact:

Capability to Deliver Heavy\u2010Ion Beams to Multiple
Users&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;At present, ATLAS is the only U.S.
national user facility for low\u2010energy nuclear physics. There is a
concept to expand the scientific reach of ATLAS by providing different
stable and\/or radioactive beams simultaneously to 2 or 3 physics
experiments. There is a motivation for the simultaneous production,
acceleration and distribution of stable and radioactive ion beams in a
superconducting linac.&amp;nbsp; Particular interest is in switching
devices for separation of ~8\u201025 MeV\/u heavy ion beams. One of the
options could be a pulsed magnet capable to operate with short (~0.25
ms) rise\/fall time, ~1\u20102% duty factor and 30 Hz repetition
rate.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact:

Overview\n&amp;nbsp;\nOffice of Nuclear Physics&amp;nbsp;
\n&amp;nbsp;\nNuclear physics (NP) research seeks to understand the
structure and interactions of atomic nuclei and the fundamental forces
and particles of nature as manifested in nuclear matter.&amp;nbsp;
Nuclear processes are responsible for the nature and abundance of all
matter, which in turn determines the essential physical characteristics
of the universe.&amp;nbsp; The primary mission of the Nuclear Physics
(NP) program is to develop and support the scientists, techniques, and
facilities that are needed for basic nuclear physics research and
isotope development and production.&amp;nbsp; Attendant upon this core
mission are responsibilities to enlarge and diversify the Nation's pool
of technically trained talent and to facilitate transfer of technology
and knowledge to support the Nation's economic base.&amp;nbsp;
\n&amp;nbsp;\nNuclear physics research is carried out at national
laboratories and accelerator facilities, and at universities.&amp;nbsp;
\nThe Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at the
Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator \nFacility (TJNAF) allows detailed
 studies of how quarks and gluons bind together to make protons and
neutrons.&amp;nbsp; \nIn an upgrade currently underway, the CEBAF
electron beam energy will be doubled from 6 to 12 GeV.&amp;nbsp; The

 (BNL) is forming new states of matter, which have not existed since the
 first moments after the birth of the Universe; a beam luminosity
upgrade is currently underway. NP is supporting the development of a
future Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) currently under
construction at Michigan State University.&amp;nbsp; The NP community is
 also exploring opportunities with a proposed electron\u2010ion
collider.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \n&amp;nbsp;\nThe NP program also supports
 research and facility operations directed toward understanding the
properties of nuclei at their limits of stability, and of the
fundamental properties of nucleons and neutrinos.&amp;nbsp; This
research is made possible with the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator
System (ATLAS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) which provides
stable and radioactive beams as well as a variety of species and
energies; a local program of basic and applied research at the
88\u2010Inch Cyclotron of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
(LBNL); the operations of accelerators for in\u2010house research
programs at two universities (Texas A&amp;amp;M University and the
Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) at Duke University),
which provide unique instrumentation with a special emphasis on the
training of students; non\u2010accelerator experiments, such as large
standalone detectors and observatories for rare events.&amp;nbsp; Of
interest is R&amp;amp;D related to future experiments in fundamental
symmetries such as neutrinoless double\u2010beta decay experiments and
measurement of the electric dipole moment of the neutron, where
extremely low background and low count rate particle detections are
essential. Another area of R&amp;amp;D is rare isotope beam
capabilities, which could lead to a set of accelerator technologies and
instrumentation developments targeted to explore the limits of nuclear
existence.&amp;nbsp; By producing and studying highly unstable nuclei
that are now formed only in stars, scientists could better understand
stellar evolution and the origin of the elements. \nOur ability to
continue making a scientific impact on the general community relies
heavily on the availability of cutting edge technology and advances in
detector instrumentation, electronics, software, accelerator design, and
 isotope production.&amp;nbsp; The technical topics that follow describe
 research and development opportunities in the equipment, techniques,
and facilities needed to conduct and advance nuclear physics research at
 existing and future facilities.&amp;nbsp; \n&amp;nbsp;\nFor additional

\n3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Improved models of
radiation transport in beam production systems:&amp;nbsp; The use of
energetic and highpower heavy ion beams at future research facilities
will create significant radiation fields.&amp;nbsp; Radiation transport
studies are needed to design and operate facilities efficiently and
safely.&amp;nbsp; Advances of radiation transport codes are desired for
(a) the inclusion of charge state distributions of initial and produced
ions including distribution changes when passing through material and
magnetic fields, (b) efficient thick\u2010shield, heat deposition, and
gas production studies, (c) the implementation of new models of heavy
ion radiation damage, and their validation against experimental data.

for video cameras: Cost efficient video sensors with resolutions of VGA
\n(640 \u00d7 480 pixel) or better but with enhanced radiation tolerance
 for prolonged operation in the presence of neutron fluxes of about 105 n
 cm\u20102 s\u20101, would be beneficial in the operation and remote
handling of equipment in radiation fields, e.g. at rare isotope
production facilities.&amp;nbsp;

high power research accelerator facilities like FRIB or medical
accelerator facilities where full beam loss accidents can have
significant dose consequences. Response times in the range of 0.3

Overview&amp;nbsp;Office of Nuclear Physics&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Nuclear
physics (NP) research seeks to understand the structure and interactions
 of atomic nuclei and the fundamental forces and particles of nature as
manifested in nuclear matter.&amp;nbsp; Nuclear processes are
responsible for the nature and abundance of all matter, which in turn
determines the essential physical characteristics of the
universe.&amp;nbsp; The primary mission of the Nuclear Physics (NP)
program is to develop and support the scientists, techniques, and
facilities that are needed for basic nuclear physics research and
isotope development and production.&amp;nbsp; Attendant upon this core
mission are responsibilities to enlarge and diversify the Nation's pool
of technically trained talent and to facilitate transfer of technology
and knowledge to support the Nation's economic base.&amp;nbsp; Nuclear
physics research is carried out at national laboratories and accelerator
 facilities, and at universities.&amp;nbsp; The Continuous Electron Beam
 Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at the Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) allows detailed studies of how quarks and
gluons bind together to make protons and neutrons.&amp;nbsp; In an
upgrade currently underway, the CEBAF electron beam energy will be
doubled from 6 to 12 GeV.&amp;nbsp; The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is forming new states of
matter, which have not existed since the first moments after the birth
of the Universe; a beam luminosity upgrade is currently underway. NP is
supporting the development of a future Facility for Rare Isotope Beams
(FRIB) currently under construction at Michigan State
University.&amp;nbsp; The NP community is also exploring opportunities
with a proposed electron\u2010ion collider.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The NP
program also supports research and facility operations directed toward
understanding the properties of nuclei at their limits of stability, and
 of the fundamental properties of nucleons and neutrinos.&amp;nbsp; This
 research is made possible with the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator
System (ATLAS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) which provides
stable and radioactive beams as well as a variety of species and
energies; a local program of basic and applied research at the
88\u2010Inch Cyclotron of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
(LBNL); the operations of accelerators for in\u2010house research
programs at two universities (Texas A&amp;amp;M University and the
Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) at Duke University),
which provide unique instrumentation with a special emphasis on the
training of students; non\u2010accelerator experiments, such as large
standalone detectors and observatories for rare events.&amp;nbsp; Of
interest is R&amp;amp;D related to future experiments in fundamental
symmetries such as neutrinoless double\u2010beta decay experiments and
measurement of the electric dipole moment of the neutron, where
extremely low background and low count rate particle detections are
essential. Another area of R&amp;amp;D is rare isotope beam
capabilities, which could lead to a set of accelerator technologies and
instrumentation developments targeted to explore the limits of nuclear
existence.&amp;nbsp; By producing and studying highly unstable nuclei
that are now formed only in stars, scientists could better understand
stellar evolution and the origin of the elements. Our ability to
continue making a scientific impact on the general community relies
heavily on the availability of cutting edge technology and advances in
detector instrumentation, electronics, software, accelerator design, and
 isotope production.&amp;nbsp; The technical topics that follow describe
 research and development opportunities in the equipment, techniques,
and facilities needed to conduct and advance nuclear physics research at
 existing and future facilities.&amp;nbsp; For additional information

Applications:&amp;nbsp; YES Accepting STTR Fast\u2010Track
Applications:&amp;nbsp; YES &amp;nbsp;Stable and radioactive isotopes
are critical to serve the broad needs of modern society and to research
in chemistry, physics, energy, environmental sciences, material sciences
 and for a variety of applications in industry and national security. A
primary goal of the Department of Energy\u2019s Isotope Development and
Production for Research and Applications Program (Isotope Program)
within the Office of Nuclear Physics (NP) is to support research and
development of methods and technologies which make available isotopes
used for research and applications that fall within the Isotope Program
portfolio.&amp;nbsp; The Isotope Program produces isotopes that are in
short supply in the U.S. and of which there exists insufficient domestic
 commercial production capability; some exceptions include some special
nuclear materials and molybdenum\u201099, for which the National Nuclear
 Security Administration has responsibility. The benefit of a viable
research and development program includes an increased portfolio of
isotope products, more cost\u2010effective and efficient
production\/processing technologies, a more reliable supply of isotopes
year\u2010round and the reduced dependence on foreign
supplies.&amp;nbsp; Additional guidance for research isotope priorities
is provided in the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee Isotopes (NSACI)
report published in 2008 and available at
(http:\/\/science.energy.gov\/np\/nsac\/). An updated version of this
report will be published in 2015. The NSACI reports serve to guide
production plans and research activities supported by the Isotope
Program &amp;nbsp;All entities submitting proposals to SBIR\/STTR
Isotope Science and Technology topic must recognize the moral and legal
obligation to comply with export controls and policies that relate to
the transfer of knowledge that has relevance to the production of
special nuclear materials (SNM).&amp;nbsp; All parties are responsible
for U.S. Export Control Laws and Regulations, which include but may not
be limited to regulations within the Department of Commerce, Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy. &amp;nbsp;a. Novel
or Improved Production Techniques for Radioisotopes or Stable Isotopes
&amp;nbsp;Research should focus on the development of advanced,
cost\u2010effective and efficient technologies for producing isotopes
that are in short supply and that are needed by research or applied
communities. This includes advanced accelerator and beam transport
technologies such as the application of high\u2010gradient particle
accelerating structures, high\u2010energy\/high\u2010current cyclotrons,
 or other technologies that could lead to compact sources and target
approaches needed to optimize isotope production. The development of
high quality, robust accelerator targets is required to utilize
high\u2010current high\u2010power\u2010density available from advanced
accelerators; of particular concern is the design and fabrication of
encapsulated salt targets and liquid metal targets.&amp;nbsp; These
targets could be subjected to energies greater than 50 MeV at beam
currents of 100 \u00b5A to 750 \u00b5A. The successful research grants
should lead to breakthroughs that will facilitate an increased supply of
 isotopes that complement the existing portfolio of isotopes produced
and distributed by the Isotope Program. This includes breakthroughs in
in\u2010situ target diagnostics, novel self-healing materials with
extreme radiation resistance for accelerator target material containment
 or encapsulation. Improved thermal and mechanical modeling capabilities
 that include target material phase change and variable material density
 are also of interest to assist design of targets exhibiting high
tolerance to extreme radiation and thermal environments. &amp;nbsp;The
development of innovative technologies that will lead to new or advanced
 methods for production of radioisotopes needed by the scientific
community, the medical community, industry, or for national purposes is
encouraged. The 2009 NSAC\u2010I report provides exemplary guidance;
this report will be updated in 2015. In the medical community,
production of radionuclides capable of functioning as
diagnostic\/therapeutic pairs or combining both traits are of particular
 interest (e.g., 64Cu\/67Cu or 44Sc\/47Sc), as are novel or
in\u2010demand radionuclides with radioactive emissions of high linear
energy transfer (LET), which are useful because of their potential for
high toxicity to diseased cells while sparing nearby healthy tissue from
 damage. Proposed technologies must have real potential to ensure a
cost\u2010effective and stable supply and distribution of such isotopes.
 Development of technologies advancing production, handling and
distribution\/transportation of isotopes are encouraged. In addition,
new approaches to hot\u2010cell target fabrication technologies that
will facilitate the recycling of precious target materials used in
production of high purity radioisotopes are also sought. An area of
significant interest is development of automation or robotics to handle
and process large mass, highly radioactive thick targets typically used
in high energy and photo\u2010transmutation accelerator based
production. &amp;nbsp;Grant applications are also sought for new
technologies to produce large quantities of enriched isotopes.&amp;nbsp;
 Enriched stable isotopes are used in radioisotope production targets
and are important in fundamental nuclear physics experiments.&amp;nbsp;
Development of process technologies aimed at optimizing the recovery and
 recycling of enriched stable isotopes is of interest. Isotopes of
interest for nuclear physics measurements include kg to ton quantities
of germanium\u201076 (76Ge), selenium\u201082 (82Se), tellurium\u2010130
 (130Te) and xenon\u2010136 (136Xe). &amp;nbsp;New production methods
for mg quantities of trans uranium elements such as californium\u2010249
 (249Cf), californium\u2010251 (251Cf) and berkelium\u2010249 (249Bk),
and ng quantities of einsteinium\u2010254 (254Es), and fermium\u2010257
(257Fm) of interest to the heavy element research community. These and
other materials are needed for chemistry research, rare particle and
rare decay experiments, and heavy element creation in nuclear physics
research. Guidance for research isotope priorities is provided in the
2009 NSACI report. http:\/\/science.energy.gov\/np\/nsac\/ as updated in
 the soon to be published 2015 NSACI long range plan.&amp;nbsp; Novel
methods are also sought for separation of stable isotopes that are
needed in small quantities, as listed in the NSACI reports.

Associate (TA) listed at the beginning of the References section for
this topic. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;b. Improved Radiochemical Separation
Methods for Preparing High\u2010Purity Radioisotopes
&amp;nbsp;Separation from contaminants and bulk material and
purification to customer specifications are critical processes in the
production cycle of a radioisotope. Many production strategies and
techniques used presently rely on old technologies and\/or require a
large, skilled workforce to operate specialized equipment, such as
manipulators for remote handling in hot cell environments.&amp;nbsp;
Conventional separation methods may include liquid\u2010liquid
extraction, column chromatography, electrochemistry, distillation or
precipitation and are used to separate radioactive and
non\u2010radioactive trace metals from target materials, lanthanides,
alkaline and alkaline earth metals, halogens, or organic materials.
High\u2010purity isotope products are essential for high\u2010yield
protein radiolabeling for radiopharmaceutical use, or to replace
materials with undesirable radioactive emissions. Improved product
specifications and reduced production costs can be achieved through
improvements in separation methods. Of particular interest are
developments that automate routine separation processes in order to
reduce operator labor hours and worker radiation dose, including
radiation hardened semi\u2010automated modules for separations or
radiation hardened automated systems for elution, radiolabeling,
purification, and dispensing. Such automated assemblies should be easily
 adaptable to different processes and different hot cell configurations,
 and should consider ease of compliance with current good manufacturing
practices (cGMP) for clinically relevant radionuclides.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;Applications are sought for innovative developments and
advances in separation technologies to reduce processing time, to
minimize radiation exposure to personnel, to improve separations
efficiencies, to automate separation systems, to minimize waste streams,
 and to develop advanced materials for highpurity radiochemical
separations.&amp;nbsp; In particular, the Department seeks breakthroughs
 in lanthanide and actinide separations.&amp;nbsp; Incremental
improvements are also encouraged, such as (1) in the development of
higher binding capacity and selectivity of resins and adsorbents for
radioisotope separations to decrease void volume and to increase
activity concentrations, (2) the scale\u2010up of separation methods
demonstrated on a small scale to large\u2010capacity production level,
and (3) new resin and adsorbent materials with increased resistance to
radiation..&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In actinide radiochemistry,
innovative methods are sought a) to improve radiochemical separations of
 or lower\u2010cost approaches for producing high\u2010purity
alpha\u2010emitting radionuclides such as radium\u2010225,
actinium\u2010225 and actinium\u2010227 from contaminant metals,
including thorium, radium, lead, lanthanides, and\/or bismuth; or b) to
improve ion\u2010exchange column materials needed for generating
lead\u2010212 from radium\u2010224, and bismuth\u2010213 from
actinium\u2010225 and\/or radium\u2010225. Advanced methods for the
preparation of high purity radium\u2010225 and actinium\u2010225 from
irradiated thorium targets are of particular interest.&amp;nbsp; The new
 technologies must be applicable in extreme radiation fields that are
characteristic of chemical processing involving high levels of
alpha\u2010and\/or beta\u2010\/gamma\u2010emitting
radionuclides.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Recent advances in translation and
clinical trials of alpha\u2010particle mediated therapies have focused
attention on the production and purification of long lived parent
radionuclides for radium\u2010223 and lead212 production.&amp;nbsp;
Regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic bone cancer
originating from advanced prostate cancer using radium\u2010223
dichloride has been obtained from the US Food and Drug Administration
and initial phase I clinical trials of
lead\u2010212\u2010TCMC\u2010Trastuzumab for treatment of HER\u20102
expressing carcinoma (e.g., ovarian, pancreatic, peritoneal), are
currently being conducted in the US.&amp;nbsp; However sufficient
amounts of the parent isotopes are not available to support full
clinical implementation. Innovative methods are sought for 1) the
production of actinium\u2010227 and thorium\u2010228, 2) the
purification of actinium\u2010227 and thorium\u2010228 from
contaminating target materials and decay chain daughters, and 3) the
generation of high specific activity radium\u2010223 and lead\u2010212
for clinical applications. 4) the development and production of matched
pair imaging isotopes for the alpha emitters to accurately determine
patient specific dosimetry to improve treatment efficacy and
safety.&amp;nbsp; Proposals that consider novel production schemes for
other alpha\u2010emitting isotopes with potential therapeutic utility
would also be of interest. &amp;nbsp;Questions \u2013 Contact:

        "description": "Background\nDuring the last 30 years, dramatic
social, economic and technological changes have occurred in many rural
areas in the United States. Although farming continues to be an
important source of income, most of rural America is moving from an
agrarian to a post-agrarian economy. The results of this transformation
have been uneven across the rural landscape. Some communities are facing
 economic decline and rural exodus, while in other communities,
especially those in areas near large urban centers or rich in natural
amenities, economic and population growth have accelerated. Even in
rural communities where economic growth and population have grown, some
have become more vulnerable to disasters caused by human action and\/or
climate changes. Many other communities are plagued by limited access to
 good schools, food, and health services. As a result, despite decades
of intervention and billions of dollars in public investment, many rural
 residents are unable to utilize important government services and new
scientific information that can help improve their quality of life; have
 higher food insecurity and childhood obesity rates; lack the required
entrepreneurship and workforce skills to take advantage of emerging
economic opportunities (e.g., climate change mitigation, safe food
processing and marketing, etc.); and are hampered by insufficient modern
 infrastructure to rapidly benefit from growing public and private
sector investment.\nApplications may be submitted for the development of
 new technology, or for the utilization of existing technology, that
address important economic and social development issues or challenges
in rural America. The applications need not be centered on agriculture,
but may be focused on any area that has the potential to provide
significant benefits to rural Americans. All applications should
explicitly discuss the specific rural problem or opportunity that will
be examined and how this technology will successfully address the
problem or opportunity. Applications submitted must include an objective
 to assess the impacts of the proposed project on the environment or the
 socio-economic development of rural areas.\n&amp;nbsp;\nTo meet these
identified problems and opportunities of rural development, the
long-term (10 year) goal for this program is to develop and
commercialize new technology, products, processes and services that
will: (i) enhance the efficiency and equity of public and private
investment in rural communities; (ii) build a diversified workforce to
meet present and future needs; (iii) enhance resilience to both natural
and human disasters; and (iv) enhance economic vitality of rural
communities and, in turn, reduce rural poverty.\n&amp;nbsp;\nFY2016

aquaculture is increasingly an important source of farmed seafood and an
 important contributor to improve food security.&amp;nbsp; In this
context new technologies are needed to protect aquaculture species
against disease and to improve production efficiency.&amp;nbsp; Emphasis
 is placed on research leading to improved production efficiency and
increased competitiveness of private sector aquaculture in the United
States. Studies on commercially important, or potentially important,
species of fish, shellfish and plants from both freshwater and marine
environments are included.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Food Safety is another
important priority in Aquaculture. Technologies are needed to ensure the
 safety of aquaculture species from heavy metals and other hazardous
materials and from human pathogens.\nTo meet these identified needs in
aquaculture, the program\u2019s long-term goals (10 years) are to
achieve improved aquaculture production resulting from improved
reproductive efficiency in fish and shellfish; improved aquaculture
production resulting from genetic improvement in fish and shellfish;
improved aquaculture production resulting from improved animal health;
improved aquaculture production with reduced water usage and improved
production efficiencies; and cost-effective production of microalgae for

        "description": "Background\nThe Small and Mid-Size Farms topic
area aims to promote and improve the sustainability and profitability of
 small and mid-size farms and ranches (where annual sales of
agricultural products are less than $250,000 for small farms and
$500,000 for mid-size farms - hereafter referred to as small farms). The
 vast majority of farms in this country are small and they play an
important role in the agricultural sector. The viability and
sustainability of small farms is important to the Nation\u2019s economy
and to the stewardship of our biological and natural resources. While
some small farms are located in urban areas, most small farms are
located in rural areas, and these farms are critical to sustaining and
strengthening the leadership and social fabric of rural communities.
Applicants are strongly encouraged to emphasize how their project would
contribute to the well-being of rural communities and institutions. In
particular, applicants should emphasize how the results of their project
 would be disseminated to other small farmers and provide benefit to the
 small farm community.\nFood safety, climate change, food security and
sustainable bioenergy diversification of agricultural production systems
 and increased efficiency of farm operations and economies of scale are
all important program priorities in this topic area.&amp;nbsp; Proposals
 are encouraged that focus on one or more of these priorities and are
appropriately scaled so as to apply to the needs and capabilities of
small farmers.\nTo meet these identified needs in the small and mid-size
 farm sector, the program\u2019s long-term goals (10 years) are to
achieve improvements in sustainability and profitability of small farms
with increased production of specialty crops and specialty animals;
improved farm management skills in small farmers that leads to more
sustainable and profitable small farms; better stewardship of natural
resources through adoption of more sustainable farming practices;
enhanced utilization of renewable energy sources and more focus on
energy efficiency and energy conservation; and better educated small
farmers who are better able to operate their farms on a sustainable and
profitable basis.\n&amp;nbsp;\nFY 2016 Research Priorities:\nExamples of
 appropriate subtopics for research applications from small businesses
include, but are not limited to, the following:\n1. New Agricultural
Enterprises \u2013 Efforts are needed to develop new agricultural
enterprises that are small scale and focused on specialty farm products,
 both plant and animal, and on innovative ways to market these farm
products through direct marketing, such as farmer\u2019s markets or
cooperatives where the financial return to the farmer is optimized or
through specialty market outlets that offer a higher financial return.
Emphasis is encouraged for organic and natural foods, specialty animal
products, such as free-range poultry or natural beef, non-food specialty
 crops, such as medicinal herbs and value-added food, and non-food
products.\n2. Development of New Marketing Strategies \u2013 Efforts are
 needed to develop appropriate new strategies for marketing
agricultural, forestry and aquacultural commodities and value-added
products produced by small farms in local, regional, national and
international markets, including the assessment of consumer demand;
identification of desired product characteristics, including packaging
and processing methods; development of new and innovative utilization of
 existing production and processing technologies; and the promotion of
efficient assembling, packing, processing, advertising and shipping
methods.\n3. Farm Management \u2013 Efforts are needed to develop tools
and skills that are appropriate for small farms that will enhance the
efficiency and profitability of small farms. New tools are also needed
that will enhance farm safety. Development of new risk management tools
to facilitate better planning is needed. Development of improved farm
level life-cycle assessment tools that help small to mid-sized farms 1)
improve operations through resource efficiency and 2) quantify ecosystem
 services provided is needed. Innovative ways to promote agro-tourism as
 a way to enhance farm profitability is encouraged.\n4. Natural
Resources and Renewable Energy \u2013 Efforts are needed to develop
farming methods scaled appropriately for small farms that are directed
at more efficient use of natural resources. Particular emphasis is
needed to develop better ways to utilize renewable energy sources, such
as wind, solar, and geothermal energy, and to promote improved energy
efficiency and conservation in farming operations.\n5. Educational
Outreach \u2013 Efforts are needed to develop new tools to ensure that
the next generation of small farmers has access to the information and
resources they need to operate their small farms on a sustainable and
profitable basis.\n6. Urban Farming \u2013 In recent years there has
been increasing interest in the establishment of small farms in urban
areas on roof tops, in abandoned building and in vacant lots. Efforts
are needed to explore ways to make urban farming more energy efficient,
environmentally sustainable and profitable. The most appropriate crops
for urban farms needs to be determined. Procedures that would increase
the establishment of new urban farms need to be
developed.\n&amp;nbsp;\nDr. Denis Ebodaghe, National Program Leader for

 National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD 20892 will be
soliciting proposals from small business concerns that possess the
research and development (R&amp;amp;D) expertise to conduct innovative
research that will contribute toward meeting the program
objectives.\n\t\n\tNIDA has an interest in understanding the
consequences of nicotine addiction and promoting research into smoking
cessation and reduction of harm caused by smoking. Electronic nicotine
delivery systems (ENDS, also known as electronic cigarettes) are
recently developed devices that deliver nicotine along with other
constituents and flavorings in an inhalable aerosol. NIDA has an
interest in supporting research into ENDS because their use is rapidly
increasing in adults and youth, and they may also represent a valuable
opportunity for harm reduction and smoking cessation. The currently
available research data on ENDS is insufficient to fully inform public
policy or to assess their overall impact on public health. Research is
hampered for several reasons, including the limited information
available on the nicotine delivery characteristics and uncertainty that
any specific model will be available for the full term of a multi-year
study. Furthermore, currently available devices do not have the product
data and manufacturing documentation required for Investigational New
Drug (IND) approval, thereby preventing their use in many clinical
studies. In order to accelerate ENDS research, NIDA is seeking proposals
 to develop a standardized ENDS to be used in clinical research. This
request for proposals may be most relevant (but not limited) to current
ENDS manufacturers, provided they are eligible to apply to the SBIR
program.\n\t\n\tThe solicitation will be available electronically on or
about June 16, 2014. You will access the solicitation through the
FedBizOpps (URL: http:\/\/www.fbo.gov) or through the NIDA website:

required for the submission of a proposal is contained in or accessible
through the solicitation package. NIDA will consider proposals submitted
 by any responsible offeror. This advertisement does not commit the
Government to award a contract. NIDA plans a closing date of September
30, 2014, for receipt of proposals. The solicitation will be available
ONLY via electronic means. Printed copies of the solicitation will not
be distributed. Potential offerors are encouraged to check the
fedbizopps.gov for updates on the program. Any updates or corrections to
 the solicitation will be posted there.\n\tThe purposes of the SBIR
program are to: (a) stimulate technological innovation in the private
sector; (b) strengthen the role of small business in meeting Federal
research\/research &amp;amp; development (R\/R&amp;amp;D) needs; (c)
increase the commercial application of Federally-supported research
results; (d) foster and encourage participation by socially and
economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned
business concerns; and improve the return on investment from
Federally-funded research for economic and social benefits to the
Nation. For purposes of the SBIR program, a small business concern is
any business concern that, on the date of award, (1) is organized for
profit, with a place of business located in the United States, which
operates primarily within the United States or which makes a significant
 contribution to the United States economy through payment of taxes or
use of American products, materials or labor; (2) is in the legal form
of an individual proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company,
 corporation, joint venture, association, trust or cooperative, except
that where the form is a joint venture, there must be less than 50
percent participation by foreign business entities in the joint venture;
 (3) more than 50% directly owned and controlled by one or more
individuals (who are citizens or permanent resident aliens of the United

Announcement (FOA) invites grant applications for research in for the
development of safe, real-time, non-invasive (or minimally invasive), in
 vivo methods to assess the development and function of the human
placenta.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tThe placenta is essential for the
maintenance of pregnancy. The prominent function of the placenta is in
the transfer of nutrients, gases and waste products between the mother
and fetus. It is effectively the lung, gut, and kidney of the fetus.
Abnormalities of placental development and function are known to
underlie many major pathologies of pregnancy including spontaneous
preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and preeclampsia. Most
information on placental biology is obtained studying placental tissue
obtained from pathological pregnancies, such as a preterm deliveries
occurring predominately in the third trimester, or from term deliveries
in which placental development has already crested.&amp;nbsp; Hence,
there is a paucity of information obtained earlier in gestation, a
period of time when many of the pregnancy pathologies are believed to
have their origins, as well as limited information gleaned throughout
gestation from normal pregnancies. The development of real-time,
non-invasive (or minimally invasive) methods to assess the development
and functionality of the placenta in vivo throughout gestation would
serve as valuable research tools enhancing our understanding of
placental biology and rooted pathologies. The development of these tools
 could lead to the identification of markers and predictors of pregnancy
 outcome, and provide a future foundation for better pregnancy
monitoring in the clinical setting.\n\n\tScope of Research to be
Performed\n\n\tThis FOA is for the development of safe, real-time,
non-invasive (or minimally invasive), in vivo methods to assess the
placenta to evaluate normal and abnormal development and function. These
 methods may include imaging or sensor technologies. The objective of
this FOA is to push the field beyond existing paradigms, such as in
vitro measurement of analytes obtained from maternal blood and\/or
Doppler velocimetry of the uterine arteries, both of which have been
associated with placental function.&amp;nbsp; Thus, applications for
studies solely measuring biomarkers using in vitro methods of placental
function&amp;nbsp;will not be considered responsive.&amp;nbsp;Similarly,
 studies focusing only on uterine artery Doppler waveforms as a measure
of placental perfusion would not be considered responsive. Projects that
 would be responsive to this FOA &amp;nbsp;include novel methods as well
 as adapting or optimizing current imaging or real-time analyte(s)
sensing technologies. In the case of imaging technologies, the
development of signaling markers, safe contrasting materials, and\/or
software enhancement will be deemed responsive. In regard to analyte
sensors, multiplexing analyte measurements is preferable. Special
consideration will be given to applications that develop methods that
are applicable throughout pregnancy, preferably starting in early
gestation during the period of trophoblast invasion and remodeling of
the uterine spiral arteries, and which also establish reference values.
Other areas of interest include, but are not limited
to:\n\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in vivo methods to assess in vivo
placental function.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in vivo methods to assess in
 vivo placental metabolism.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in vivo methods to
measure placental nutrient transfer.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in vivo
methods to measure in vivo placental microvascular blood
flow.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in vivo methods to measure placental
structural development.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in vivo methods for the
measurement of placental perfusion.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in vivo
methods for the measurement of placental function in complicated
pregnancies and patterns of progression to disease
states.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in vivo methods for the spatial and
temporal regional mapping of placental function and association with
placental histopathology in normal and pathologic
states.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of in vivo methods for the measurement of
placental response to environmental stressors (e.g. oxygen levels,
tobacco exposure, maternal exercise, psychological stress).\n\n\n\tHuman
 studies are preferable, but animal studies are acceptable to evaluate
proof of concept and the safety of methods that are directly applicable
for future translational studies in the human.\n",

        "topic_name": "Commercial Space Vehicle Tracking Using 1090 MHz
ADS-b",
        "description": "\n\tCommercial space vehicles licensed by the
FAA include launch vehicles, re-entry vehicles and manned high altitude
balloons. &amp;nbsp;Operations of commercial space vehicles will become
increasingly frequent and then routine in various regions of the
US.&amp;nbsp; The primary objective of this research is to ensure no
degradation to both the safety and efficiency of the National Airspace
(NAS) for other NAS users such as commercial general and military
aviation occurs as commercial space vehicles become routine.&amp;nbsp;
The proposed research will build on existing Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) to perform surveillance of commercial
space vehicles as they transition through the NAS either on the ascent
or descent phases of flight by building on existing, operational,
flight- proven 1090MHz Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast
(ADS-B) technology.&amp;nbsp; ADS-B is germane to any nature of flight
operations (a characteristic attributed to GPS based technologies); this
 service could be used to surveil commercial space operations, and
provide much needed information to ATM services that are responsible for
 the associated operational environments and provide them situational
awareness of these vehicles above the NAS.&amp;nbsp; Accordingly, while
ADS-B is potentially a favorable candidate for surveillance of
commercial space operations, extensive research is required to determine
 the necessary operational, functional and physical system
characteristics for development of an adequate spacecraft surveillance
platform(s).\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tADS-B &amp;ldquo;Out&amp;rdquo;
equipment transmits position and velocity and other information from a
given aircraft to the operating network of ~650 ADS-B ground based
receivers for use by Air Traffic Control personnel.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
It operates at frequencies of 978MHz and 1090MHz.&amp;nbsp; However
current ADS-B &amp;ldquo;Out&amp;rdquo; equipment for commercial and
general aviation is designed to operate below 60,000 feet at subsonic
velocities and accelerations below 4Gs, making it of limited value to
commercial space vehicles.&amp;nbsp; While a prototype 978 MHz ADS-B Out
 specifically designed for commercial space vehicles has been flown on
high altitude balloons and various rocket powered vehicles (including a
commercial launch vehicle), an analogous1090 MHz ADS-B Out prototype has
 not been designed, let alone developed.&amp;nbsp; Aside from its
transmission frequency, 1090MHz equipment has a different message
structure and other characteristics from 978MHz.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Equipment in both frequencies offer unique benefits to space
transportation operations in the NAS and are needed for test flights to
properly evaluate them.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, 978MHz is primarily used
 in the US whereas 1090 MHz is used internationally so that US-built
commercial space vehicles equipped with a functioning 1090 MHz ADS-B Out
 could more easily operate in these countries.&amp;nbsp; Finally the
capability for receipt of ADS-B messages from a commercial space vehicle
 beyond line of sight of FAA receivers (over broad ocean areas,
mountainous areas, deep valleys) is an enabler for continuous seamless
tracking of these vehicles. This capability is achievable using
existing&amp;nbsp; communications satellite capabilities at low cost but
 has not been demonstrated with commercial space vehicles and is a
necessary research shortfall to be addressed in this
effort\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase I
Outcomes:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\tPerform a trade study exploring 1)
upgrading existing commercial 1090 MHz ADS-B Outfor use on commercial
launch vehicles , re-entry vehicles and manned high altitude balloons or
 2)&amp;ldquo;clean sheet design&amp;rdquo; and deliver study
findings.&amp;nbsp; Based on this trade study select a path forward
and&amp;nbsp; provide 1) preliminary design information for a 1090 MHz
ADS-B Out prototype and one (1) functioning&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;bread
board&amp;rdquo; level maturity prototype.&amp;nbsp; During Phase I, the
 delivered&amp;nbsp; prototype will be used&amp;nbsp; for independent
function\/ performance testing with the FAA GPS altitude\/velocity
simulator as well as high altitude balloon flights (funded or arranged
by FAA) to collect and analyze trajectory data. &amp;nbsp;Trajectory
data will be used to evaluate prototype performance and to develop and
anchor modeling and simulation exercises.\n\t\n\t\tIn parallel to task
described above perform a trade study on optimal means of transmitting
ADS-B messages from the payload using an existing communication
satellite message format\/technology when it is not line of sight of FAA
 receiving equipment.&amp;nbsp; Study will explore 1) upgrading existing
 commercial satellite communication equipment that has minimal latency
capability and low power, volume and weight for use on commercial launch
 vehicles, re-entry vehicles and manned high altitude balloons or 2) a
&amp;ldquo;clean sheet design&amp;rdquo; utilizing readily available
COTS technology for this application and deliver study
findings.&amp;nbsp; Based on this trade study select a path forward
and&amp;nbsp; provide 1) preliminary design information for a commercial
 satellite communication transmitter to support ADS-B payload described
above and one (1) functioning&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;bread
board&amp;rdquo; level maturity prototype capable of receiving data
(i.e.ADS-B messages) from&amp;nbsp; the ADS-B equipment described above
and transmitting it for tracking purposes.&amp;nbsp; During Phase
I,&amp;nbsp; the delivered&amp;nbsp; prototype will be used&amp;nbsp;
for independent function\/ performance testing to receive and transmit
data as well as high altitude balloon flights and potentially flights on
 rocket powered vehicles\n\n\n\tExpected Phase II
Outcomes:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\tDesign and develop commercial space
 flight surveillance test bed, as is described within the formulated
study plan within phase 1 of this research endeavor. Test bed should
include hardware and software development capabilities, as well as
full-fidelity simulation tools.\n\t\n\t\tDeliver TBD (up to a total of
10) 1090MHz ADS-B prototypes for ground testing in the test bed
described above and on commercial&amp;nbsp; space transportation
platforms (tro be arranged by FAA)\n\t\n\t\tInitial delivery of TBD (up
to 5) early prototypes based on lessons learned from and design of bread
 board model delivered in phase I for ground testing balloon and
suborbital testing TBD months after award of Phase II\n\t\n\t\tFollow on
 delivery of TBD (up to 5) advanced&amp;nbsp; prototypes based on
lessons learned from and design of bread board model delivered in phase I
 for ground testing balloon and suborbital testing TBD (greater than 6
months after award)\n\t\n\t\tPerform viability and reliability testing
to establish whether phase 1 outcomes produce a practical solution for
surveillance of commercial space flights within the National Airspace
System (NAS). Viability testing will examine if the provided
surveillance data for a commercial space flight satisfies the
information requirements needed for air traffic management and airspace
accessibility. Reliability testing will seek to identify the integrity
of that surveillance information by determining the level of maintained
surveillance accuracy and the frequency of
&amp;ldquo;drop-outs&amp;rdquo; or degradation in signal. From these
tests, a preliminary feasibility assessment can be made, and if deemed
viable and reliable, the associated philosophy of use for the prototype
ADS-B transceiver can then begin formal development (to be eventually
captured within a Concept of Operations or a Concept of
Use).\n\t\n\t\tPreform a limited set of operational assessment studies,
in which the impacts to safety and efficiency across different
environments are identified and examined. The goal of these studies will
 be to establish an initial set of findings that identify correlative
relationships between a commercial space flight transiting an airspace
sector and the general effects imposed upon that airspace. To accomplish
 such, studies could vary traffic levels, traffic configuration,
airspace size, and the direction of transit for the commercial
spacecraft (i.e. inbound or outbound). Overall, the outcome of this
research will begin to identify challenges to full integration of
commercial space flights within the NAS.\n\t\n\t\tPublish a final report
 capturing the findings of the above outlined activities which, in
summary, will provide an initial overall assessment of the ADS-B
prototype, including its functionality, operational viability,
operational reliability, and operational applicability and a path
forward to commercial use\n\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n",

Inventory Tool",
        "description": "\n\tCommunities throughout the U.S. are
increasingly encouraging walking for transportation and recreation in
order to meet a range of safety, health, equity, sustainability, and
other goals. One way to accomplish this is by actively working to fill
gaps in the pedestrian network and to improve sidewalks or other
pedestrian pathways that have fallen into disrepair. A significant
challenge to working methodically and strategically toward pedestrian
network connectivity is a lack of comprehensive GIS-based data on the
presence (or lack) of sidewalks or other pedestrian connectors
communitywide. In fact, many communities do not have a baseline
inventory of their sidewalks because collecting this data can be
expensive and difficult to maintain. However, recent advances in mobile
technology and cloud-based computing, as well as increasingly
sophisticated crowdsourcing applications, have the potential to address
this issue.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tA prototype is needed to facilitate
decentralized public collection of a baseline sidewalk inventory, which
can then be compiled into a central dataset to inform decision-making
and public policy. Given their broad availability, GPS and database
capabilities, and the fact that they are always &amp;ldquo;in our
pocket,&amp;rdquo; it may make sense for the prototype to be built as a
mobile phone application; however, there may be other approaches. The
prototype should enable an individual user to simply and efficiently
document the presence or lack of a sidewalk. In addition to the
inventory, it may be possible to add data features such as an assessment
 of sidewalk conditions. It may be possible to incorporate information
from FHWA&amp;rsquo;s Road Safety Audit process and build off of and\/or
 incorporate data from existing resources such as Google&amp;rsquo;s
&amp;ldquo;walking route&amp;rdquo; application. This prototype will
focus on the creation of a baseline sidewalk inventory, and would
ideally be integrated with existing services such as SeeClickFix, which
focus more on the identification of spot-specific
issues.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tIt will be important to build the
functionality so that the new application links seamlessly to other
existing datasets. For example, the State of Maryland has been a leader
in the government-led collection of ADA-related data along State roads.
The new application could add a public functionality and interface by
displaying this type of information (if it is publicly available) as
part of a strategy to &amp;ldquo;flag issues&amp;rdquo; with the data
and thus keep it updated over time. The new application would also begin
 to fill in preliminary data on non-State owned roads. It will be
important to link the new public crowdsourcing application to the
automated Public Rights-of-Way Assessment Process (PROWAP), which was
developed through support from the SBIR program (DTFH61-57-10-C-10081).
FHWA is also supporting Exploratory Advanced Research to develop
technology to allow people who are blind or who have low vision to
navigate in the public right-of-way and the proposed new sidewalk
inventory application could provide an important locally-verified input
to this technology once it is available. There are likely many other
synergies between an application that enables decentralized public
crowdsourcing of pedestrian data and the PROWAP and Exploratory Advanced
 Research project, which should be explored in the research and
development process.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tA public mobile-based sidewalk
 inventory application will leverage and maximize the return on
investment in recent and ongoing pedestrian data initiatives. It will
assist in the creation of more complete sidewalk datasets, which is
especially important given the emphasis on performance measures in
Federal surface transportation legislation, and the fact that more and
more communities are developing communitywide GIS-based prioritization
methodologies that will impact, for example, where they choose to build
new sidewalks or other pedestrian routes.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tBy
facilitating the creation of connected pedestrian networks, the
application will improve safety because research shows that having
sidewalks on both sides of the road can contribute to a significant
reduction in &amp;ldquo;walking along the road&amp;rdquo; pedestrian
crashes.&amp;nbsp; By tracking the condition of pedestrian networks, the
 application will contribute to asset management processes and encourage
 a state of good repair. By facilitating nonmotorized transportation, it
 will contribute to climate change and other environmental
sustainability-related goals. Finally, it will create an affordable tool
 that would allow students to engage in primary data collection that is
of immediate practical value to local, regional, and State government
staff and that also leads directly to important planning, policy, and
budgetary decision-making processes central to citizen science, a core
element of the STEM Initiative.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tA small business
that develops this product could sell it to municipalities, Metropolitan
 Planning Organizations, or State Departments of Transportation.
Non-governmental organizations such as community associations also might
 purchase the end product. An application that contributes to the
development of a sidewalk inventory will create value that could be
captured by a small business; however, it will only continue to be
relevant and valuable if it is maintained and kept up to date. A small
business could provide this ongoing service to clients for a fee. A
small business could also generate revenue through the sale of
advertisements displayed while the application is being used and\/or it
could offer an ad free version that a user or client could choose to
purchase.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase I
Outcomes:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of a prototype
mobile-based application to facilitate the decentralized collection of a
 baseline pedestrian network inventory data.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of a
back end application to compile data collected into a central
dataset.\n\t\n\t\tAssessment of other existing data sources and
evaluation of strategies to link seamlessly with them (where
appropriate).\n\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase II
Outcomes:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\tBeta testing and upgrades to the

        "topic_name": "Parking-Cruising Caused Congestion &amp;amp;
Targeting Public Mitigation Investments",
        "description": "\n\tIdentifying the
Problem\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tIt is a common perception and concern among
 city mayors and transportation professionals that an enormous amount of
 time and fuel is wasted by motorists circling or
&amp;ldquo;cruising&amp;rdquo; for free or underpriced on-street
parking. &amp;nbsp;As an example of such concern, over 70 city parking
managers and senior transportation policy officials came to San
Francisco in Sept. 2011 to address this topic at a Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA\/)National Association of City Transportation
Officials jointly-sponsored, two-day Best Practices in Parking
Management and Pricing Conference, which was led off by San Francisco
Mayor Edwin Lee.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tDespite such high
interest, there is surprisingly almost no research on how drivers
actually cruise for parking, which would be critical to understand in
order to ascertain the magnitude of this problem.&amp;nbsp; We do not
know, for example, whether and\/or with what frequency motorists:
&amp;nbsp;(1) follow a set pattern for choosing blocks to search; (2)
pass up a legal space in hopes of finding another legal space deemed
preferable; (3) park in an illegal space even when a legal one may be
availably nearby, and; (4) aggressively seek or pass up an open space on
 the opposite side of the street that they are driving requiring either
crossing multiple same-direction travel lanes on a one-way road or
making a U-turn on a two-way
road.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tDespite such lack of knowledge,
multiple research studies on cruising have been undertaken, which are
premised on assumptions about cruising behaviors, with measurements
following such assumptions.&amp;nbsp; The results of 16 studies of
cruising for on-street parking in 11 cities were summarized in The High
Cost of Free Parking(Shoup, 2005).&amp;nbsp; The share of city traffic
cruising in these studies ranged from 8% to 74%, and averaged 30%, with
an average search time of 3.5 minutes to 13.9 minutes, or an
&amp;ldquo;average of the averages&amp;rdquo; of 8.1 minutes.&amp;nbsp;
The accuracy of the results of these studies&amp;mdash;conducted
independently of each other and deploying different
methodologies&amp;mdash;is uncertain, but it does seem that circling is a
 real problem where it has been studied.&amp;nbsp; Of course, studies of
 cruising are most likely to occur in areas where it is thought to be
common, but remedies would be targeted to such areas too, so this bias
as to the selection of study sites may not be
problematic.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tIf cruising for parking
could somehow be eliminated where it is thought to be a problem, its
congestion-reducing benefits would likely be substantial.&amp;nbsp; To
eliminate such cruising in San Francisco, FHWA invested $19 million in
the SFpark pilot project.&amp;nbsp; This active parking pricing and
management project (sometimes also referred to as performance parking)
deployed electronic sensors and communications technologies to determine
 parking utilization rates at all times for on-street and public
off-street parking.&amp;nbsp; SFpark has been using such data to set and
 change parking prices to meet availability targets (typically aiming
for around 20% of the number of spaces) and to offer real-time
information about parking availability by specific
location.[1]\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPreliminary research results from
three different studies of SFpark are showing that, regardless of the
research methodology chosen to approximate how cruising actually occurs
(using the same methodological assumptions both before and after
performance parking deployment to determine relative changes), cruising
appears to have declined by about 50%.&amp;nbsp; (Heavy use and
suspected abuse of handicapped parking placards which allow unlimited
free parking have been identified as the biggest culprit to not
realizing even greater declines.)&amp;nbsp; An additional FHWA-directed
study is nearing completion to estimate costs of deploying similar
systems for other cities (which should be lower than San
Francisco&amp;rsquo;s costs, benefiting from lessons learned
there).\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tToday, city and regional transportation
professionals do not know if or where the problem may be of a sufficient
 magnitude to merit a costly solution.&amp;nbsp; For a city or region to
 make a wise choice about investing in a performance parking system, or
indeed any system to reduce congestion, it would need to understand both
 costs (which, as noted above, will be much better understood after
completion of an FHWA-directed cost study) and benefits in absolute
terms to make a comparative assessment of alternative
congestion-reduction investment options.&amp;nbsp; Cities cannot,
though, reasonably estimate benefits until they are first able to
quantify with some accuracy the amount of time wasted today by cruising,
 so that an absolute net benefit, and not just a relative improvement
from deploying performance parking to reduce cruising, can be accurately
 modeled.&amp;nbsp; Development of one or more tools is required to
enable total levels of cruising within cities as a whole, and specific
areas within them, to be ascertained.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tForging a
Solution\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tA number of different tools and strategies
 could be developed or applied to measure actual cruising levels which
would be responsive to this solicitation.&amp;nbsp; Some approaches may
be &amp;ldquo;standalone,&amp;rdquo; meaning that they would only
require the use of the single proposed approach or tool to determine
cruising levels.&amp;nbsp; Other solutions may need to work in concert
with differently-sourced, already-available information in combination
with the newly proposed tool or approach.&amp;nbsp; As an example of the
 latter, a respondent could choose to propose a tool or approach to
ascertain actual cruising levels that relies separately upon a city
having or developing good parking occupancy data, which could be
combined with whatever new tool or approach is developed under this
solicitation.&amp;nbsp; In support of this example, a few cities already
 do a reasonable job ascertaining parking occupancy data using, alone or
 in combination, parking sensors, payment data, and manual
surveys.&amp;nbsp; This solicitation is open to proposals that are
either standalone or dependent upon other available information to
discern total cruising levels.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tImmediately below
are a few ideas as to how one might respond to this
solicitation.&amp;nbsp; The discussion is provided only for illustrative
 purposes and should not be construed to suggest that, in the evaluation
 process, proposed approaches that are not raised here would be at a
competitive disadvantage to approaches that
are.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tOne strategy to learn more about the behavior
of drivers searching for on-street parking when availability is
constrained would entail first obtaining a very large GPS travel
database.&amp;nbsp; Using such a database, respondents could offer an
approach to determine the prevalence and duration of circling for
parking (because of its lack of availability), thus enabling its
congestion-causing impacts to be measured.[2]&amp;nbsp; While not
required, it would be ideal if a respondent choosing this or a similar
approach would be willing and able to contact drivers thought to have
been cruising for a follow-up survey.&amp;nbsp; This would enable a
confirmation that what looked like circling for parking really was
that&amp;mdash;and not just someone who was lost&amp;mdash;and also to
ask related questions, such as how far away the driver had to park from
his\/her ultimate destination.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tAnother possible
approach would be to test driver behavior in simulators.&amp;nbsp; The
street network for one or more areas of a city known for constrained and
 coveted on-street parking would, as envisioned, be used in the
simulator, and drivers who regularly or occasionally drive and park
on-street in the simulated areas would be recruited.&amp;nbsp; Traffic
conditions and available trade-offs (circling time versus cost for
garage parking) should be presented in the simulator environment in as
realistic a way as possible.&amp;nbsp; For example, recruits, while
rewarded for participation, would be sent home with less cash (but
earlier) for electing in the simulator to circle for parking instead of
to head to the nearest garage.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tA third approach
would be to scale up a technique that was tested in New York City,
whereby video cameras were deployed to count the number cars that pass
up an on-street parking space immediately after it becomes available to
ascertain the percentage of traffic cruising.[3]&amp;nbsp; This approach
 would need to be paired with another source of information or another
approach to ascertain parking occupancy levels so that the total amount
of cruising could be determined.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tRegardless of the
research approach that is proposed, it is critical that the applicant
clearly identifies the source or sources of data to be used, the party
or parties that control the data (if it is pre-existing) or whose
permission would be required for the applicant itself to gather the data
 (e.g., the specific government entity that would need to approve the
mounting of a camera in public space), and the degree of
risk&amp;ndash;and the plan to mitigate such risk&amp;mdash;that the
plan to acquire existing or gather new data might fail.&amp;nbsp; If a
third party is required to gather or provide the needed data, the
application should demonstrate, or at least describe, the interest
and\/or support from the third party (such as by including a letter of
interest from such party as part of the
submission).\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase I Outcomes:\n\n\tThe
outcome expected from Phase 1 is a detailed concept that demonstrates
the viability of one or more tools and\/or systems to ascertain rates of
 cruising for free or underpriced on-street parking.\n\n\tExpected Phase
 II Outcomes:\n\n\tPhase II efforts would include demonstrating a
working prototype tool and\/or system (which may or may not include the
manufacturing of a new product) that ascertains cruising rates in a city
 (with some, but not overwhelming, preference for San Francisco where
the FHWA-funded SFpark program has been implemented) and\/or area within
 a city that is thought to have constrained on-street parking that is
leading to substantial
cruising.\n\n\t\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t[1]Rather
 than better managing existing parking, some cities might instead choose
 to focus on providing more supply, but it is enormously expensive
(sometimes exceeding $50,000 per space in urban parking structures) and
its provision at a level sufficient to satisfy peak-of-the-peak demand
at no price to the user is very detrimental to the goal of livable
community design.&amp;nbsp; Combining relatively low cost technologies
with pricing incentives reduces the parking footprint by flattening peak
 demand, encouraging parking turnover, persuading drivers to use parking
 that is slightly further away from their destinations, and making
transit and non-motorized access competitively more
desirable.&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t[2]In the unlikely event that
such data could be obtained retroactively for San Francisco,
corresponding to a time period in calendar year 2013 or before when
parking sensors were operational and thus occupancy was measured and
recorded as part of the SFpark pilot, this would be beneficial as it
would enable a direct comparison between measured parking occupancy
levels and cruising.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t[3]A driver passing up an open
 space would be thought not to have been cruising, while cruising is
assumed for a motorist who takes the space.&amp;nbsp; If, on average,
one driver passes up an open space before the next driver takes it, then
 it would be estimated that half of drivers in that block at that time
are cruising for parking.\n\t\n\n",

        "description": "\n\tMini-roundabout is a single-lane roundabout
with a traversable central island and splitter islands. The inscribed
circular diameter of mini-roundabout ranges from 50 ft to 90 ft. This
intersection design is suitable for junctions of 2-lane and\/or 3-lane
high volume collector roads. A well designed mini-roundabout can deliver
 more than twice the traffic handling capacity when compared to
intersections under All-Way-Stop-Control. Limited deployments in the
United States show the following types of traffic operation and safety
problems can be effectively addressed by mini-roundabout
design:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\tEliminate traffic congestion at
All-Way-Stop-Controlled intersections,\n\t\n\t\tReduce major road
approaching speed at Two-Way-Stop-Controlled intersections to provide
more gaps to minor road traffic.\n\t\n\t\tProvide a viable intersection
improvement option when a regular sized roundabout is too costly due to
costs of purchasing additional land and relocating utility lines and
storm drainage system.\n\t\n\t\tCalm the traffic and improve safety for
both vehicle drivers and pedestrians and
bicyclists.\n\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tMini-roundabout is one of the
alternative intersection designs being promoted nation-wide by the USDOT
 under the second round of Every Day Count (EDC2) initiative. The
superior traffic handling capability of this intersection design has
been proven at multiple sites that used to suffer recurring congestion
and speed or congestion induced traffic safety problems. However, the
costs of mini-roundabouts vary significantly by location. At some
locations, mini-roundabouts were installed in one or 2 days at costs of
$20,000 or less each; at other locations, it took 3 weeks and over
$300,000 to construct a mini-roundabout. Such range of cost variation
hinders the wider adoption of mini-roundabout
design.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe objective of this project is to develop
 modular curbing and delineation designs that can be configured to form
into sidewalk curbs, central islands, and splitter islands of different
sizes (like the building blocks used in landscape projects). These
modular blocks must be strong enough to withstand up to 22,000 lb\/axle
occasional truck load; and durable enough to last 10 years without
change in shape or reduction in strength.&amp;nbsp; Ideally, the modular
 blocks can be manufactured using recyclable material that would
otherwise end up into the landfill; the mass production of such
&amp;ldquo;building block&amp;rdquo; material shall reduce the cost of
mini-roundabout installation and make the cost of mini-roundabout
construction highly predictable.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase I
Outcomes:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe desired Phase I outcomes
are:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\tProve that the modular building block
concept for mini-roundabout construction is feasible and has significant
 cost advantage over the cast in place construction
method.\n\t\n\t\tDesign and prototype modular blocks that
can:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tForm into central islands of 3 different
diameters commonly used in mini-roundabout design\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tForm
into corner curbs of 3 different diameters commonly used in urban street
 curb design\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tForm into splitter islands and bulb-outs

applications\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDevelop attachment hardware that can
anchor the modular blocks onto the roadway surface\n\t\n\t\tDevelop
draining mechanism that facilitates water to drain towards the

mini-roundabouts using assembly in place modular blocks (drawing, shapes
 of modular blocks needed, number of each type of modular blocks, the
completed set of hardware, and the estimated
cost).\n\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase II
Outcomes:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tAssuming the Phase I products are
satisfactory, the desired outcome of Phase II is to produce enough
modular blocks to prove the concept at five to six intersections to
explore the level of labor effort and the types of tools needed to

 of modular block material needed, and the total costs of such

 will Provide Better Correlation to Service Plan",
        "description": "\n\tTransit agencies traditionally face major
issues in rider system utilization and travel patterns.\n\t\n\tFirst, it
 has been a challenge to accurately count the number of riders that
board and alight along stops or stations on a transit route.&amp;nbsp;
In the vast majority of transit agencies, this has been traditionally
accomplished through &amp;ldquo;ride checking;&amp;rdquo; a manual
process of counting riders with pen, paper, and punch counters while
riding a transit vehicle (most often a bus) in revenue
service.&amp;nbsp; Once collected, these data must be manually input
into a database and then verified for accuracy to have meaning to the
transit agency for planning purposes.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tA few transit
 agencies use advanced methods to count riders using a technology called
 Automated Passenger Counters or APCs.&amp;nbsp; APCs remove the need to
 manually count boarding or alighting riders by using a variety of
different technologies to include infra-red beams, treadle mats,
visioning, heat sensors, low-frequency ultrasound waves, and other
technologies working in tandem with a software-based heuristic
algorithm. Typically, these data are automatically downloaded to a
database system or the data are removed using storage media such as a
Flash Drive and then imported to a database for automatic, pre-set
analysis and report generation.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tOnce collected by
APCs, these boarding and alighting data are usually correlated with data
 from an Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) system or other geographic
information systems or GIS file such as a bus stop inventory to match
boardings and alightings with the specific, fixed, geographic location
of a transit stop or station.&amp;nbsp; Historically, APCs have proven
useful to transit agencies for collecting rider boardings and
alightings, but APC systems have suffered counting accuracy issues,
particularly at high rider load points, and at end-of-line count
reconciliation.&amp;nbsp; APCs are mostly used on transit bus front and
rear doors with limited use on rail vehicles due to very wide doors;
another issue that most APC system technology have been unable to
solve.\n\n\tSecond, it has been a challenge for transit agencies to
track the origin and destination of riders.&amp;nbsp; In only a few
cases transit agencies have the ability to accurately and, anonymously,
track the origins and destinations of riders; this mostly occurs in a
closed turnstile\/gated system used by rail transit.&amp;nbsp;
Traditionally, tracking the origin and destination of riders has been
done using labor intensive and costly origin and destination surveys,
usually using only small sample of riders.&amp;nbsp; These surveys are
usually not directly correlated with rider boardings and
alightings.\n\n\tThe Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is seeking
exploratory proposals that will demonstrate innovative, economic,
accurate, and durable technologies, devices, or solutions to improve
rider boarding and alighting counting accuracy and rider
origin-destination trip-making accuracy, with special attention given to
 projects that could significantly improve both the accuracy of this
information and correlate them with rider origins and
destinations.\n\n\tProject proposals must include a methodology on how
it will use data to quantitatively demonstrate that their recommended

Ensuring Lockability of Seat Belts and Mitigating Entrapment Risk in
Mis-Use Conditions",
        "description": "\n\tThe Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard
(FMVSS) No. 208, &amp;ldquo;Occupant crash protection,&amp;rdquo;
requires that passenger seating positions of passenger cars and some
other passenger vehicles have a seat belt assembly whose lap belt
portion is lockable so that the seat belt assembly can be used to
tightly secure a child restraint system.&amp;nbsp; FMVSS No. 208 further
 specifies that the means to lock the lap belt portion of the seat belt
assembly shall not consist of any device that must be attached by the
vehicle user to the vehicle and shall not require any inverting,
twisting, or deforming of the belt webbing.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tVehicle
 manufacturers have met the lockability requirement in FMVSS No. 208 by
two possible means:&amp;nbsp; a switchable retractor (switching from an
emergency locking retractor (ELR) to an automatic locking retractor
(ALR)) and a locking latchplate.&amp;nbsp; Of the two means, the
switchable retractor is most commonly used.&amp;nbsp; However, there
have been cases where children in the rear seat have accidentally
activated the ALR mode (often by misuse of the seat belt) and caused
entanglement of the seat belt around the child&amp;rsquo;s body
parts.&amp;nbsp; In some cases, the belt had to be physically cut to
release the occupant. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The locking latch plate method
 is less popular because the lap belt does not automatically adjust to
fit snugly around a child restraint system and results in slack in the
lap belt portion of the seat belt.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, a seat belt
with a locking latch plate may not always retract properly into the
stowed position when not in use.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase I
Outcomes:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe Phase I goal of this research project
 is a concept development for a device that is attached to the seat belt
 assembly that:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\tAchieves lockability
requirements in FMVSS No. 208 (S7.1.1.5) as tested per Test Procedure
208-14 (data sheet 8) and complies with all applicable FMVSSs (FMVSS No.
 208, FMVSS No. 209, and FMVSS No. 210),\n\t\n\t\tIs easy to make it
lockable &amp;ndash; does not require complex manipulation to make the
seat belt lockable,\n\t\n\t\tComplies with comfort and convenience
requirements specified in S7.4 of FMVSS No. 208 - wearing a
lap\/shoulder belt should be similar to current practice, easy and
intuitive to use,\n\t\n\t\tAchieves seat belt fit according to current
practice (5th percentile adult female, and 50th percentile adult male)
&amp;ndash; the shoulder portion of the lap\/shoulder belt fits snugly
across the chest (away from the neck and face) and the lap portion of
the belt should fits snugly low on the hips and away from the
abdomen,&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tStows the seat belt away easily when not in
use,\n\t\n\t\tDoes not pose risk of entrapment when mis-used,
and\n\t\n\t\tDoes not introduce new risks to occupants in a
vehicle.\n\n\n\tThe awardee shall develop one or more concepts for
candidate devices that meet the above requirements.&amp;nbsp; Phase 1
concept development should include at least a design, supporting
documentation and some simulation to evaluate its potential
effectiveness.&amp;nbsp; Prototypes will be accepted but are beyond the
Phase I requirements.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase II
Outcomes:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tFor Phase II, the awardee will evaluate
the candidate devices developed in Phase I and select one of the devices
 based on demonstrated durability, effective performance under repeated
use for the lifetime of the vehicle, cost effectiveness of the device,
and its versatility in incorporation into current vehicle seat belt
systems.&amp;nbsp; The Phase II proposal must include prototype
development.&amp;nbsp; NHTSA will work with the awardee to provide for

evaluation methods to quantify remaining strength of line pipe steel and

        "description": "\n\tPipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration \n\n\tThe energy transportation network of the U.S.
consists of over 2.6million miles of pipelines. That&amp;rsquo;s enough
to circle the earth about 100 times. These pipelines are operated by
approximately 3,000 companies, large and small. U.S. operators transport
 almost two-thirds of the Nation&amp;rsquo;s energy. According to the
U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2011, oil and gas
exploration and production companies operating in the United States
added almost 3.8 billion barrels of crude oil and lease condensate
proved reserves, an increase of 15 percent, and the greatest volume
increase since EIA began publishing proved reserves estimates in 1977.
Also, proved reserves of U.S. wet natural gas rose by 31.2 trillion
cubic feet in 2011 to a new record high of 348.8 trillion cubic
feet.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe Nation&amp;#39;s more than two million miles of
 pipelines safely deliver trillions of cubic feet of natural gas and
hundreds of billions of ton\/miles of liquid petroleum products each
year. Natural gas provides for fully 24% of our country&amp;rsquo;s
total energy consumption, and petroleum provides for another 39%. These
volumes of energy products that pipelines move are well beyond the
capacity of other forms of transportation. It would take a constant line
 of tanker trucks, approximately 750 per day, loading up and moving out
every 2 minutes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to move the volume of
even a modest pipeline. The railroad-equivalent of this single pipeline
would consist of a train of 75, 2,000-barrel tank rail cars traveling
the length of the pipeline every day. These alternatives would require
significantly more personnel, cost substantially more, produce larger
volumes of pollutants, and would subject the public and environment to
greater risk when considering overall safety.&amp;nbsp; Pipeline systems
 are the safest available means to move these hazardous materials in
bulk.\n\n\tThe Federal government rededicated itself to pipeline safety
in 2012 when the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation
 Act were signed. It raises the bar for pipeline safety and commits the
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) to
exploring technologies and methods which could increase the integrity of
 the U.S. pipeline network.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe mission of
PHMSA&amp;rsquo;s Pipeline Safety Research Program is to sponsor
research and development projects focused on providing near-term
solutions that will improve the safety, reduce environmental impact, and
 enhance the reliability of the Nation&amp;rsquo;s pipeline
transportation system. For pipeline safety, research is being solicited
for the development of innovative technologies and methods for hazardous
 liquids and\/or natural gas pipelines. The following area of interest
is focused on Non-Destructive Testing NDT towards quantifying the
remaining strength of the existing steel pipeline
infrastructure.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tFocus Area: Develop and demonstrate
 new non-destructive evaluation methods to quantify remaining strength
of line pipe steel and or pipeline fittings:\n\n\tThe U.S. Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 49, Parts 192 and 195 stipulates that
ASME B31G or RSTRENG be used to assess the remaining strength of
corroded pipe. A review of existing burst test data raised some concerns
 that use of these methods can, in some instances, result in predicted
failure pressures that are greater than the recorded burst pressures
from actual tests. No burst testing data exist on steel pipeline
fittings.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tIndustry has also researched methods for
assessing the remaining strength of corroded pipelines. This has led to
the development of new criteria and has extended the range of assessment
 methods to include numerical analysis. While there has been substantial
 progress, there are areas where the existing criteria require
improvements, including steel pipeline fittings. Issues identified
include limitations on the interaction of closely spaced defects, the
effects of external loading, and cyclic pressure loading. Furthermore,
as operators start to use higher strength materials, there will be an
increasing need to assess the integrity of high strength steel pipeline
fittings that have been corroded while further validating the
application of existing criteria and models for these
materials.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPast work by industry and the U.S.
Department of Transportation&amp;rsquo;s Pipeline and Hazardous Safety
Administration (PHMSA) has funded research to address these issues in
recent years on pipeline steels. The work has included a program of
materials testing, finite element (FE) analyses, and full scale burst
testing to develop methods for assessing corrosion damage in pipelines
of strength grade up to X100. Reports from this work are available at:
http:\/\/primis.phmsa.dot.gov\/matrix\/PrjHome.rdm?prj=171\n\t\n\tBackground:
 \n\tCorrosion metal loss is one of the major damage mechanisms to
transmission pipelines worldwide. A corrosion metal-loss defect further
reduces the strength of the damaged pipeline sections while introducing
localized stress and strain concentrations. Several methods have been
developed for assessing the remaining strength of corroded pipelines,
such as the ASME B31G (B31G) and RSTRENG models. These models were
derived from experimental tests and theoretical\/numerical studies of
the failure behavior of corroded pipelines. The test pipes contained
either corrosion metal-loss defects or simulated metal-loss defects and
featured materials with relatively high toughness properties for X65 and
 above. The early burst tests used vintage pipe (predominantly X52 or
lower) with low toughness properties. Plastic deformation and collapse
of the ligament or surrounding material determines the failure behavior
of the corroded pipe. In principle, the existing assessment methods are
only applicable to pipelines with toughness levels that are sufficient
to prevent a toughness-dependent failure.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe
research completed did not include analysis of burst test data on steel
line pipe with real corrosion defects in strength grades above X65, as
the data were not available.&amp;nbsp; To address this gap, a focused
program is recommended on higher strength line pipe of strength grades
above X65 with electro-chemically induced, simulated corrosion defects.
These defects can be produced using electrochemical means to approximate
 real corrosion in the field, as opposed to flat-bottomed rectangular
machined patches.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tMechanical properties of pipe
metal help define the principal characteristics of its technical state.
Heat input during the coating process may change these properties.
Developing new methods for pipeline technical diagnosis and evaluating a
 line pipe&amp;rsquo;s actual technical state will help ensure the
pipe&amp;#39;s safe lifetime
operation.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tChallenge&amp;ndash; Proposals are being
 sought for the development of future guidance and consideration of the
background factors described above. The descriptive physical model of
impact strength change effect on the pipeline&amp;rsquo;s actual
technical state needs to be investigated. The objective of this topic is
 to determine the next steps after an operator determines the mechanical
 properties of the steel line pipe in material grade X65 and above and
or pipeline fittings are insufficient.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProposals
may consider the following attributes for pipe, grade X65 and
above:\n\n\t\n\t\tCan a pipe safe pressure evaluation be conducted using
 B31G, Modified B31G or other engineering assessment methods for failure
 pressure\n\t\n\t\tDoes the yield strength to tensile strength ratio
affect the usage of safe pressure evaluations using B31G, Modified B31G
or other engineering assessment methods for failure
pressure?\n\t\n\t\tDoes the flow stress or folias factor provide
conservatism when being used to assess the failure pressure of pipe
grades X65 and higher?\n\t\n\t\tDoes toughness of the higher pipe grades
 affects the conservatism?&amp;nbsp; If so, how?\n\t\n\t\tHow do
combined stresses such as maximum (72% SMYS or 80% SMYS) hoop stresses
and higher longitudinal stresses up to yield strength or over yield
strength affect usage of these failure pressure evaluation
methods?\n\t\n\t\tWhat other attributes should be considered and their
effects, such as pipe coating application temperature or strain
hardening effects?\n\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tProposals may consider the
following attributes for fittings (bends):\n\n\t\n\t\tCan pipe bends,
hot or forged, be assessed for failure pressure using safe pressure
evaluations using B31G, Modified B31G or other engineering assessment
methods? If so, what are the limitations of this usage?\n\t\n\t\tWhat
should be the required thickness of the fitting to maintain maximum
operating pressures and external stresses? Which standards should be
used for this determination?\n\t\n\t\tHow do combined stresses such as
maximum (72% SMYS or 80% SMYS) hoop stresses and higher longitudinal
stresses up to yield strength or over yield strength affect usage of
these failure pressure evaluation methods?\n\t\n\t\tWhat other
attributes should be considered and their effects? Fitting grade, heat
treatment, fitting coating application temperature,
etc.\n\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase I Outcomes:\n\n\tA successful
 Phase I will demonstrate, through mathematical models and scientific
analysis, a determination as to whether RSTENG needs to be modified when
 pipes with X65 and above.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase II

potential models that predict the remaining strength of pipe and or

essential sources of medicines.&amp;nbsp; The World Health Organization
estimates that ~80% of the world&amp;rsquo;s population relies on
traditional medicines made from natural products. The modern
pharmaceutical industry is also dependent on plant-based medicines, with
 as much as 50% of all drugs based on natural products or derived from a
 natural product origin. Clearly, plants and other natural products
offer excellent sources of health-promoting medicines. Thus it is
extremely important that we enhance our capacity to further examine
these traditional modalities and achieve a solid scientific
understanding of their potential health benefits.\n\n\tNonetheless,
substantial problems exist in identifying and understanding natural
products and their bioactivity.&amp;nbsp; While the potential for
natural products in health and wellbeing is clear, the challenges that
hamper the full utilization of these resources are many, with the
greatest hurdle simply being the enormous amount of time and effort
required for structure identification and characterization of the
mechanisms by which natural products exert their pharmacological
activity. Improvements in collection, bioassay, isolation, purification,
 de-replication, yield, and supply of natural products are possible.
While advances have been made to help overcome these hurdles, there
exist many new untapped technological resources that may improve natural
 products research methodologies.\n\n\tResearch Objectives\n\n\tThe
purpose of NCCAM&amp;rsquo;s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Grant program is to stimulate technological innovation in the private
sector, strengthen the role of small business in meeting Federal
research or research and development needs, and improve the return on
investment from Federally-funded research for economic and social
benefits to the Nation.\n\n\tNatural products offer a diverse reservoir
of biologically active components.&amp;nbsp; The single chemical
entities, as well as their mixtures in natural product extracts, have a
long history of use as drugs, drug precursors, and\/or complementary
health adjuvants. However, methodologies for the identification of
bioactive natural products and their mechanism(s) of pharmacological
action are often inadequate or too time consuming to be compatible with
modern screening platforms.&amp;nbsp; We believe that many existing
biotechnologies could be adapted to improve natural products
research.&amp;nbsp; Innovative methods might utilize genomics,
bio-products engineering, bioinformatics, synthetic and molecular
biology, or nanotechnology. The purpose of this proposed initiative is
to improve upon the currently available natural products methodologies
thereby increasing the efficiency of research in this
field.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tWith this SBIR initiative, NCCAM is proposing to
focus on five areas that could significantly improve the progress in
natural products research:&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\tTechnologies aimed at
improving field applications for characterizing natural product
sources\/species and their diverse bioactive constituents, (examples
&amp;ndash; DNA barcoding, gene chips, activity based profiling,
biosensors, spectrometric equipment and techniques,
etc.)\n\t\n\t\tTechnologies aimed at the rapid removal of nuisance
compounds in the crude extracts of natural products, (examples
&amp;ndash; innovative chromatographic technologies, resins, catch and
release-type systems, etc.)\n\t\n\t\tTechnologies aimed at the
development of highly sensitive phenotypic\/high content bioassays
including capacity to identify potential synergistic mechanisms,
(examples - image-based cellular assays, multiple-endpoint analysis
based on phenotypic changes, bioengineering chemically sensitive
strains, etc.)\n\t\n\t\tTechnologies aimed at the creation and
exploitation of model systems for the expression of natural product
constituents in high product yielding hosts, (broad spectrum
heterologous or homologous expression hosts, stimulation of biosynthetic
 pathways, mutation, etc.) and\n\t\n\t\tTechnologies aimed at predicting
 and\/or quantifying risks of natural product&amp;ndash;drug
interactions (examples &amp;ndash; designed in vitro interaction assays
or kits, in silico technologies, etc.)\n\n\n\tThis FOA is intended to
help move useful technologies from non-commercial laboratories into the
commercial marketplace by inviting SBIR grant applications from
successful small businesses for further development of such technologies
 that are relevant to the missions of the sponsoring NIH Institutes and
Centers. The supported research and development will likely include
making the tools more robust and easy to use, and will likely require
close collaboration between the original developers of these
technologies and SBCs. These partnerships may be accomplished in any of a
 number of ways, including the use of multiple principle investigators.

encourages applications from small business concerns (SBCs) for Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) projects that propose development of
 reagents and equipment for the detection and identification of
infectious agents, including those involved in vertical transmission of

 valuable aquatic, nonhuman primate, and rodent genetic stocks, and
potentially other species.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, this FOA seeks to
stimulate research and development of a system that is sensitive,
selective, automated, and cost\/size effective for rapid detection and
identification of microbes and that will be available commercially as a
standardized, streamlined procedure; easy to operate and maintain by a
single person. Ideally, most of the process would be automated and all
of the possible components should be integrated into a single unified
platform. Associated automated data acquisition and data analysis is
highly encouraged. Platforms for automated molecular detection of
individual or simultaneous microbial pathogens may include, but are not
limited to: pathogen-specific antigens used for detection (ELISA,
multiplex); mass tags, genetic or transcript markers
(arrays\/chips-based), nanoparticle based biosensors, and
high-throughput genome sequencing. The use of complementary technologies
 is also encouraged. Microbial pathogens may include but are not limited
 to bacteria and related microbes, virus, fungus, parasites (such as
protozoan) and prions. The target species for this FOA include, but are
not limited to, rodents, nonhuman primates, and aquatic models used in
biomedical research. Applications proposing research projects involving
predominantly agricultural\/farm\/companion animals will be given lower
priority.\n",

 significant amount of funds in the development of new technologies to
study biology and behavior, from basic and clinical perspectives,
through a variety of mechanisms, including, from NIH, the R01, R21, P01,
 P41, and P50 grants. This investment has produced a large number of
technologies that include hardware (e.g., instruments, devices, etc.),
software (e.g., computational models, informatics tools, data analytic
methods, etc.) and wetware (e.g., cell-free assays, bioactive agents,
imaging probes, etc.). While these technologies are put to good use by
their developers, such non-commercial developers devote little attention
 to making their tools robust and easy to use by the broad research
community. Consequently, the promise of these advanced technologies is
often realized only by the tools developers and their close associates.
Moreover, ongoing support to maintain and update technologies in
non-commercial settings is difficult to obtain.\n\n\tIn contrast, tools
that are commercially available need to be sturdy and easy to use, and
commercial success often provides the means for continued maintenance
and improvements of the underlying technology. This FOA is intended to
help move useful technologies from non-commercial laboratories into the
commercial marketplace by inviting SBIR grant applications from small
businesses for further development of such technologies that are
relevant to the missions of the sponsoring NIH institutes and centers.
The supported research and development will likely include making the
tools more robust and easy to use, and will likely require close
collaboration between the original developers of these technologies and
SBCs. These partnerships may be accomplished in any of a number of ways,
 including the use of multiple principle investigators.\n\n\tThis FOA
encourages SBIR grant applications to commercially develop tools of any
type relevant to the mission of one or more of the participating NIH
institutes and centers.\n\n\tNHGRI is interested in supporting the
commercialization of technologies that can be used to help to understand
 the structure and biology of genomes, and genomic contributions to the
biology of disease; and to accelerate the use of genomics to advance the
 science of medicine and the effectiveness of healthcare (see

 and Drug Delivery Systems",
        "description": "\n\tPurpose\n\n\tThis Funding Opportunity
Announcement (FOA) invites Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
grant applications from small business concerns (SBCs) to address
different and complementary research needs for the development
appropriate pediatric drug formulations in different age groups. This
FOA also encourages the development and testing of novel drug delivery
systems in the pediatric population. The goal of this FOA is not to
duplicate or compete with the private sector but to complement and
accelerate the development of appropriate pediatric drugs formulations
and drug delivery systems.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tThe lack of appropriate
pediatric formulations has been identified as a major obstacle for the
study and use of drugs in children. Pediatric formulations may be
inappropriate for different reasons. Children under 12 years of age
often have difficulty in swallowing capsules, while those under 4 years
generally cannot swallow tablets. Liquid formulations facilitate dose
adjustments and are easily administered and recommended for infants and
younger children. The production of formulations may be limited by the
solubility and stability of drugs requiring taste-masking agents,
preservatives and solubility of excipients. Liquid formulations may also
 not be optimal for the developing world, where clean water and
refrigeration may not be available.\n\n\tIn general, there is a need in
pediatrics to develop flexible dosage forms that are oro-dispersible or
can be prepared as oral liquid formulations. There is an increased
recognition that for medicines requiring precise dosage and titration,
the development of a universal technology platform could allow for
&amp;quot;tailored dosages&amp;quot; and a range of dosage forms
appropriate for children at different developmental stages, or for other
 populations with swallowing difficulties.\n\n\tThe Biopharmaceutics
Classification System (BCS), the scientific framework for classifying
drug substances based on their intestinal permeability and
solubility\/dissolution rates, is widely used to assure bioequivalence
of drug products in adults. Its application in pediatrics has been
challenged because the tools used to measure intestinal permeability may
 not be applicable to young children, as the intestinal mucosa of
infants and young children is more permeable than that of adults. In
addition, the effects of developmental factors such as gastrointestinal
pH, gastrointestinal motility, gastric emptying times and intestinal
transport systems on drug bioavailability have not been systematically
studied in children.\n\n\tDriven by federal legislation that now
requires evaluation of most drugs in children, renewed attention has
been focused on the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Much less
attention has been devoted to the excipients that render these
formulations feasible, palatable and stable. \n\n\tMany APIs are
extremely bitter, which can make the development of palatable
formulations extremely difficult. Adult formulations are frequently
taste masked by coating the tablet or by formulating in a capsule which
are generally not useful for young children. Because the primary market
for most pharmaceuticals is in the adult population where palatability
has not been a major consideration, taste masking techniques have not
been well developed.\n\n\tThree broad approaches have been used: 1) to
create a barrier between taste receptors and drug (physical coatings,
capsules); 2) &amp;nbsp;making chemical or solubility modifications; and
 3) to overwhelm the unpleasant taste by adding flavors and sweeteners. A
 new approach has been the development of bitter blockers based on the
biology of taste.\n\n\tThere are significant age-related differences in
how children and adults respond to flavors. Therefore, adult sensory
panels may not be able to predict flavors that children prefer and those
 they will reject. The use of taste sensing analytical devices
(electronic tongues) for initial screening of foods and beverages in
children is still in its infancy. The advantages of this approach
include its speed, relatively low cost, and lack of risk. The use of
this technology has so far not been validated in
children.\n\n\tImplications for psychophysical testing as well sensory
evaluation methods for children have been published in standard guides
and review articles. There are, however, no peer-reviewed research
studies that systematically determined the validity of many of these
methods among children of varying ages. Cultural groups also differ in
their sensitivity and preference for bitter tastes and other flavors.
The lack of acceptable and palatable dosage forms is a major reason
responsible for the low rates of adherence in children, and has been
implicated as the major reason for pediatric hospital readmissions with
treatment failures.\n\n\tIn addition to drugs administered orally, other
 routes of administration are being used in children with varying
degrees of success. With the advent of the needle-free injections,
devices for parenteral drug delivery can now be grouped into invasive
and non-invasive categories. Neonates require the use of invasive
delivery systems and formulations providing appropriate concentrations
and volumes. It is anticipated that the increased availability of
biotechnology-based drugs will require the development of reliable
delivery systems using the subcutaneous route. In addition to topically
applied pediatric medicines, transdermal patches and iontophoresis
technologies have been used in children with limited success. However,
transdermal patches may in the future be used for non- invasive delivery
 of vaccines.\n\n\tThe recent advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology
 have resulted in the development of nanoparticle-based diagnostic and
therapeutic approaches for the treatment of adult cancers, infections,
asthma and other conditions. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery has
advantages over conventional formulations including increased solubility
 of poorly water soluble drugs, sustained release and delivery of drugs
to specific targets tissues, and minimizing general toxic
effects.&amp;nbsp; There is a need to test new drug delivery systems in
pediatrics using nano-particle-facilitated delivery. Targeted therapy
using anti-cancer and anti-infective drugs encapsulated in
nanoparticles, for example, holds considerable promise to reduce
toxicity and improve the efficacy of drugs given to children.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The rapid advances in peptide and protein
pharmacology have fueled great interest in these types of compounds.
Although initial attempts have failed (e.g., insulin delivered by
inhalation), novel experimental smart polymer-based drug delivery
systems have been developed to deliver drugs at a controlled rate over
long periods of time. Smart polymers are macromolecules that display
significant physicochemical changes in response to small changes in the
environment.&amp;nbsp; Major advantages of smart polymer based systems
include delivery for site specific action and decreased total body
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;exposure. In vivo nano-device-based platforms which
improves efficacy of treatment when combined with diagnostics in one
construct (theranostics) is being tested in children with
cancer.\n\n\tThe delivery of drugs to the lungs or for systemic delivery
 using inhalers has been limited by the different physiology of children
 compared with adults (e.g., airway diameter, short respiratory cycle
time, and small tidal volume). There is a need for versatile, efficient
devices given the variety of treatment modalities needed and the
developmental and behavioral characteristics of young
children.\n\n\tScope\n\n\tSpecific areas of research interest include
but are not limited to the following:\n\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of
innovative technologies and platforms for oral pediatric formulations
for &amp;nbsp;poorly soluble drugs, unpalatable drugs, and for drugs

        "description": "\n\tTraditional exposure assessment has relied
on the use of questionnaires, ambient monitoring of pollutants and
limited personal exposure assessments for individual analytes in
biomonitoring efforts. These approaches have identified many potential
contributing factors but are known to suffer from limitations in
misclassification due to spatial and temporal distribution of analytes,
imprecision of the methods or failure to account for multiple covariate
analytes or mixed routes of exposure. &amp;nbsp;For these reasons
biomonitoring for chemicals and their metabolites, nutrition factors,
and even chemical threat agents has become a primary factor in
establishing the link between exposure and disease in human population
studies. Through the National Biomonitoring Program (NBP) and The
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the CDC has
established gold standard methods to measure over 450 chemicals and
nutritional markers in blood, serum, urine, breast milk and meconium.
These include measuring toxic metals, phthalates, persistent organic
pollutants, pesticides, vitamins and other micronutrients and tobacco
smoke markers, including cotinine and NNAL, using a variety of mass
spectrometry approaches. Although the NBP currently conducts
biomonitoring analyses for state health departments and NIH-funded
studies, including the National Children&amp;rsquo;s Study, capacity for
 analyzing biospecimens from other human population studies is limited.
Traditional biomonitoring programs such as the CDC&amp;#39;s often
require large sample volume, especially for blood and serum analysis,
making it impractical for many population studies where very small
volumes of blood are collected for genetic or other analyses.
&amp;nbsp;There is therefore an urgent need for technology development
for biomonitoring capabilities to complement and expand the
CDC&amp;rsquo;s efforts.\n\n\tNIEHS and other NIH Institutes have
supported a limited number of projects through the SBIR\/STTR programs
for biomonitoring technologies that use Raman spectroscopy, XRF
technology, or antibody or aptamer-based approaches. However, a larger
program is needed to develop point-of-use, field-deployable or
laboratory-based methods that:\n\n\t\n\t\tUse small sample volumes,
especially for blood\n\t\n\t\tCan measure multiple analytes or classes
of compounds simultaneously in blood, serum, urine, saliva, breast milk,
 meconium, hair or toenails\n\t\n\t\tAre resistant to fouling or effects
 from interferents\n\t\n\t\tAre relatively low-cost, rapid and amenable
to use in multiple laboratories\n\t\n\t\tCan measure chemicals or their
metabolites at the level of ambient exposures with appropriate
&amp;nbsp;limits of detection and specificity\n\n\n\tTechnologies should
 be developed to measure chemicals or functionally related compounds
that include, but are not limited to, toxic metals, endocrine-active
compounds, air pollution components (e.g., PAHs), persistent organic
pollutants, pesticides, endogenous hormones, flame retardants, and
chemical threat agents. Technologies that detect multiple toxins
produced by pathogenic organisms, including dust mite or pet allergens,
endotoxin, and mycotoxins are appropriate for this FOA; however,
technologies to detect the pathogenic organisms themselves are not
responsive. &amp;nbsp;Modular approaches that can be used to apply a
single analytical technique to a range of possible chemical classes are
encouraged.&amp;nbsp; For instance, a group may focus on a technology to
 detect all commercially-produced pesticides and their metabolites in
one platform, a large set of known or suspected endocrine-disrupting
compounds in a second, and genotoxic compounds in a third.&amp;nbsp;
These &amp;lsquo;chips&amp;rsquo; could then be selectively used by
investigators to characterize the levels of some or all of these
analytes in their study. Approaches that combine detection of individual
 analytes together with functional assays are also encouraged, but not
required. For example, a technology may detect individual
estrogen-active compounds along with a measure of overall estrogenic
activity in that sample.\n\n\tThe long-term goal of this effort is to
enable rapid, sensitive and low-cost detection of large sets of analytes
 reflecting the complexity of exposure in the personal environment,
i.e., the &amp;quot;exposome&amp;quot; concept. Such technologies will
be valuable not only to individual researchers in the field of
environmental epidemiology and public health, but to Federal agencies,
State and Local institutions including emergency responders, and to
community-based efforts to understand exposures in susceptible
populations.\n\n\tThis FOA supports development of technologies for
detection of multiple analytes. Applications for biomonitoring
technology for single analyte detection are not
responsive.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n",

Announcement (FOA) is to stimulate the small business community to
develop innovative methods to: (1) identify human milk oligosaccharides
(HMO) that have antimicrobial activity; (2) isolate and purify promising
 HMOs; (3) characterize the structure of these HMOs in order to develop a
 library of bioactive HMOs to serve as templates for chemical or
biological synthesis of promising HMOs; and (4) ramp up synthetic
procedures using GMP to produce batches of HMOs in kilogram quantities
for preclinical
testing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe central
objective of this initiative is to develop new GMP methods to generate
quantities of purified HMOs with known antimicrobial activity in large
enough quantities to begin preclinical testing. The ultimate objective
of this initiative is to develop a new class of antimicrobial agents
that are active against enteric organisms for use in clinical care as
preventive agents or for treatment of enteric
disease.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe scope of the FOA includes the isolation,
purification, structural characterization, and synthesis of bioactive
HMOs in kilogram quantities. The scope also includes developing new
methods for assessing bioactivity of HMOs and for initiating novel
structure-function studies to ascertain what HMO structures are most
likely to bind to enteric microbes to prevent entry into enterocytes.
Also within the scope of the FOA would be studies designed to ascertain
the spectrum of microbes that particular HMOs can neutralize. Because
HMOs do not interfere with the synthetic machinery of the microbes, it
is unlikely that bacterial or viral resistance would develop against

 that will be supported under this SBIR FOA. Note that all products must
 be directly related to the health and safety training of hazardous

health training:\n\n\tE-teaching in safety and health training
encompasses products that assist trainers\/instructors in developing and
 delivering safety and health training for a number of environments
ranging from classroom to remote learning situations. Potential products
 include, but are not limited to, products aimed at peer-trainers or
worker-trainers; trainers needing assistance with language, literacy or
cultural differences in the classroom; trainers needing assistance in
developing small group activities and other teaching methodologies and
technology applications for broadcasting safety and health classes and
resources to remote learners.\n\n\tB.&amp;nbsp; Products to support
e-learning in safety and health training: \n\n\tE-learning in safety and
 health training involves technology deployment to provide
individualized or small group based training in learning centers, in a
technology-enabled &amp;quot;smart classroom&amp;quot; or to a
learner&amp;#39;s desktop, cell phone, tablet, or PDA. This might also
utilize social media applications such as &amp;lsquo;twitter&amp;rsquo;.
 &amp;nbsp;As an ATT option, e-learning is used to enable individualized

as part of, after, or in place of classroom training. Potential products
 include but are not limited to the creation of topic oriented products
that address clearly identified health and safety issues involving
hazardous materials and emergency and disaster response.\n\n\tC.
Products to support the training of community citizens and researchers
involved in disaster responses:&amp;nbsp; \n\n\tMuch important
environmental health research can only be done during the response to,
and recovery from, a major disaster
(http:\/\/tools.niehs.nih.gov\/wetp\/index.cfm?id=556).&amp;nbsp; In the
 aftermath of numerous disasters, there has been an acknowledged and
urgent need for public health research, and a number of topical areas
and research questions have been identified including those that, if
addressed, would impact recovery as well as future preparedness efforts.
 These topics included community resilience, evacuation and policy
decision making, the public health and healthcare system response, mold
mitigation and health issues, characterization of the morbidity,
disability, and mortality among impacted populations (including
behavioral health outcomes, and outcomes for responders), community and
worker education and training, communications, and the use of social
media. &amp;nbsp;Products that assist in the training of researchers in
order for them to participate safely and productively are
encouraged.\n\n\tIn addition, numerous disasters have made clear that
the term &amp;#39;responder&amp;#39; often applies to citizens
protecting themselves, their property and communities during and
recovering from&amp;nbsp;these events. Thus, there is likely a need for
short, incident specific awareness training that can be delivered during
 the disaster recovery period including training on issues such as
confined spaces, blood borne pathogens, personal protective equipment,
hazard assessment, fire watch, first aid\/CPR, site safety, working
around heavy equipment, physical threats such as heat stress, fatigue,
shift work, fall protection, and psychological stress

        "description": "\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPurpose\n\n\tThe objective
of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to support the
development of devices to evaluate dynamic changes in microvascular
blood flow and tissue oxygenation.&amp;nbsp; Devices designed to measure
 temporal changes in regional perfusion and oxygen delivery following
red blood cell transfusion or in peripheral vascular disease are of
particular interest. &amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThis FOA is seeking applications
that propose to develop devices capable of analyzing temporal
differences in tissue oxygen saturation and microvascular blood flow.
Desirable criteria for the successful measurement of tissue oxygenation
and\/or microcirculation in the context of evaluating the efficacy of
blood transfusion, or the natural and treated course of peripheral
vascular disease, in clinical research are: utility of the parameter(s)
reported in measuring tissue oxygenation; noninvasiveness; capability to
 make repeated measurements, accuracy and robustness of measurements;
ease of use; and reproducibility between operators. Imaging technologies
 are of interest and will be considered. Successful development of
devices that measure oxygenation or microcirculation in cerebral and\/or
 splanchnic tissues are of particular interest. &amp;nbsp;Minimally
invasive methods that require the use of contrast agents and probes may
be acceptable and would be dependent on their safety profile.&amp;nbsp;
Development and validation of biomarkers and\/or combination of
biomarkers that reflect changes in tissue perfusion and oxygenation in
the context of blood transfusion are also of
interest.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tThe primary indication for red blood cell
 (RBC) transfusion is to increase tissue oxygenation in patients with
inadequate circulating red cell mass. Oxygen delivery to tissues is
partially dependent on hemoglobin concentration along with blood
viscosity and homeostatic mechanisms including cardiac output and
microvascular blood flow.&amp;nbsp; In patients with co-morbidities,
improvements in global oxygen delivery may not result in improvements in
 regional perfusion and oxygen delivery.&amp;nbsp; In addition blood
transfusion carries risks.&amp;nbsp; Two priority research questions in
transfusion medicine are: 1) defining and evaluating the extent by which
 RBC transfusion improves the delivery of oxygen to tissues, especially
in moderately anemic, normovolemic subjects who represent a substantial
proportion of the transfused patients; and 2) determining if various
factors related to a RBC product, such as storage time or differences in
 manufacturing, affect how transfused RBCs influence microcirculatory
flow and tissue oxygenation.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tClinical researchers have
employed two FDA approved, non-invasive methods to assess the
effectiveness of a RBC transfusion.&amp;nbsp; One method is sublingual
microscopy, which measures changes in microcirculatory density and flow
using sidestream dark field (SDF) imaging.&amp;nbsp; The other
instrumentation is tissue oximetry, which measures changes in tissue
oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to assess hemoglobin
 oxygen saturation in the microcirculation of peripheral tissue(s),
usually of the thenar eminence.&amp;nbsp; These technologies are often
selected because they are noninvasive with the capability to make
repeated measurements.&amp;nbsp; The tissues that can be evaluated with
these methods are limited. The reproducibility and robustness of
measurement provided by these methods can be problematic in the clinical
 research setting.&amp;nbsp; Rigorous validation of these technologies
for the indicated purpose of measuring effectiveness of a RBC
transfusion is also lacking.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe development of minimally
 invasive procedures to accurately measure tissue oxygenation and that
allow serial testing are also needed in other NHLBI scientific areas.
For example, the use of NIRS to measure tissue hemoglobin saturation
(StO2) in skeletal muscle in the context of Peripheral Arterial Disease
is controversial.&amp;nbsp; The contribution of myoglobin cannot be
excluded and cannot address interactions between microvascular and
intracellular oxygen stores.&amp;nbsp; Measurements can also be
influenced due to failure to discriminate between capillary and venous
blood and the distribution of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin within
the area of measurement.\n\n\tScientific Scope\n\n\tResearch examples
include but are not limited to:\n\n\t\n\t\tImprovement of the NIRS
technique to reduce measurement variability.\n\t\n\t\tImprovement or
development of new minimally or non-invasive technologies to measure
splanchnic tissue oxygenation in neonates, pediatrics and adult
populations.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of new minimally or non-invasive
techniques for the measurement of changes in tissue oxygenation related
to RBC transfusion.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of new minimally or
non-invasive techniques for the measurement of changes in tissue
oxygenation related to monitoring of peripheral arterial disease in the
lower limbs for diagnosis\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of new minimally or
non-invasive techniques for the measurement of changes in
microcirculation related to RBC transfusion.\n\t\n\t\tImprovement of
sidestream darkfield (SDF) and\/or orthogonal polarization spectral
(OPS) microscopy techniques to reduce intra- and inter-rater variability
 for the measurement of changes in microcirculation related to RBC
transfusion.\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment and validation of biomarkers (or
combination of) that reflect changes in tissue perfusion and oxygenation
 in the context of blood transfusion and\/or peripheral vascular
disease.\n\n\n\tAreas of research that will not be considered responsive
 to this FOA include the development of techniques or devices that
require more than minimally invasive procedures and\/or the use of
radioactive probes.\n\n\tApplicants are strongly encouraged to discuss
the proposed approach, concept, or strategy with Scientific\/Research
staff listed under Agency Contacts, to determine responsiveness to this
FOA.\n\n\tNon-Fast Track Phase II applications will not be
accepted.&amp;nbsp; Phase I awardees can apply to the companion SBIR FOA

Technologies (EW)\n\n\tWireless Technologies (WT)\n\n\tWireless has
become the platform for many applications with direct impact on
virtually every aspect of life, evolving well beyond mobile phones and
PDAs to other devices, services, channels, and content. Microwave
circuits afford a wider frequency spectrum and extremely short antennae.
 With GaAs and SiGe, entire microwave transceivers can be inexpensively
put on a single chip. Modulation methods like spread-spectrum and
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing bring greater spectral
efficiency and more bits\/Hz of bandwidth, and lead to less
susceptibility to noise, interference, and multi-path distortion.
On-chip DSPs allow new signal-processing functions. RFID chips are
providing improvements in warehousing, materials handling, and shipping
operations, replacing bar-code labels in many
applications.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tWT1. Wireless Systems\n\n\tProposals

        "topic_name": "Decontamination Technologies for Biological
Agents",
        "description": "\n\tOBJECTIVE:&amp;nbsp; Demonstrate a novel
technology platform that is non-destructive to common environmental
surfaces but capable of destroying a range of biological
agents.\n\n\tDESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; Following the release of a virulent
biological agent that demonstrates persistence in the environment,
thereby posing a continuing exposure risk to the public, harsh chemical
technologies are typically employed to decontaminate (destroy) the
hazard.&amp;nbsp; The decontamination process is known as
remediation.&amp;nbsp; Currently available approaches to remediation may
 involve the use of acidic, caustic or other hazardous substances such
as chlorine dioxide, sodium hydroxide, bleach, metal ion alkoxides, or
formaldehyde.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; An example of the use of such
technology was the large-scale decontamination of government properties
using chlorine dioxide gas following the 2001 anthrax letter events.
Vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP) and methyl bromide, while generally
having good material compatibility characteristics, are also options for
 decontamination of biological agents although each demonstrates
limitations.&amp;nbsp; For example, high loadings of indigenous bacteria
 or the presence of reactive surfaces can consume hydrogen peroxide and
complicate the decontamination process, while methyl bromide is an
EPA-regulated gaseous chemical that depletes ozone in the
atmosphere.&amp;nbsp; Enzymatic technologies also have been developed
and applied for decontamination purposes.&amp;nbsp; Limitations with
enzymatic processes include less than satisfactory turnover rates of a
substrate molecule or enzyme deactivation when used in an operational
environment.&amp;nbsp; As a result of the drawbacks or limitations to
the use of the aforementioned technologies, recovery of affected areas
becomes more costly and resumption of normal activities can be delayed,
due to the need for extensive restoration or renovation
activities.&amp;nbsp; The DHS Science and Technology Directorate seeks
innovative technical approaches for the safe, efficacious, selective and
 environmentally-friendly destruction of persistent biological agents
that can overcome the limitations of current decontamination
technologies and exhibit good material compatibility
characteristics.&amp;nbsp; For a biological agent, the required level of
 decontamination efficacy is a 6-log reduction in viable agent (99.9999%
 destruction) on three or more of the following environmental surfaces
(e.g., concrete, wood, soil, galvanized metal, glass, plastic, painted
wallboard).\n\n\tPHASE I:&amp;nbsp; Develop, demonstrate and show
material compatibility for an innovative, low-cost,
environmentally-friendly concept for 6-log reduction of a non-hazardous,
 biological agent simulant (e.g., Bacillus thuringiensis or other
spore-forming bacteria) on three environmental surfaces such as
concrete, wood, soil, galvanized metal, glass, plastic, and painted
wallboard.&amp;nbsp; Deliverables include a detailed project report
showing material compatibility for a low cost and environmentally
friendly solution as outlined above, as well as a project plan for Phase
 II, including costs, schedule and proposed subcontract arrangements, if
 any.\n\n\tPHASE II:&amp;nbsp; Optimize the innovative technical
approach and demonstrate 6-log reduction in viable biological agent
simulant such as Bacillus anthracis &amp;ndash; Sterne strain on the
following environmental surfaces:&amp;nbsp; concrete, wood, soil,
galvanized metal, glass, plastic, and painted wallboard. Demonstrate
required efficacy can be achieved under the following three different
environmental conditions:&amp;nbsp; low temperature\/low humidity, room
temperature\/40-50% relative humidity, and high temperature\/high
humidity.&amp;nbsp; Demonstrate the ability to deliver the
decontamination technology using commercial devices that are compatible
with standard decontamination operations.&amp;nbsp; Demonstrate a small
pilot-scale production process that can produce the innovative
decontamination product in a safe and cost-effective manner that can be
readily scaled by a qualified manufacturer for cost-effective production
 of large, commercial quantities.&amp;nbsp; Deliverables also include
0.5 &amp;ndash; 1.0 kilogram of innovative decontamination technology
product for independent government evaluation and a project and business
 plan for commercialization during Phase III, including costs, schedule
and any proposed subcontract or toll manufacturing (license)
arrangements.\n\n\tPHASE III:&amp;nbsp; COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT
APPLICATIONS:&amp;nbsp; The innovative decontamination technology can be
 produced and supplied to the government for decontamination of public
health hazards involving virulent biological agents.&amp;nbsp; Other
potential and significant applications and market opportunities in the
commercial sector may include pest control, mold and fungus removal,
sterilization of medical facilities and sensitive equipment, water
purification.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n",

Vulnerabilities in Embedded Systems ",
        "description": "\n\tOBJECTIVE:&amp;nbsp; AMENDED TOPIC (as of
May 1, 2014):&amp;nbsp; Develop innovative techniques to rapidly and
automatically detect and automatically patch vulnerabilities in complex
networked, embedded systems while offline.&amp;nbsp; This offline
analysis and data-mining of features of large firmware image populations
 enables identification of vulnerabilities in the firmware of embedded
devices, to support risk assessment and mitigation actions of complex
software systems found throughout national critical infrastructures and
systems.\n\n\tDESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; AMENDED TOPIC (as of May 1,
2014):&amp;nbsp; Embedded systems form a ubiquitous, networked,
computing substrate that underlies much of modern technological society.
 Embedded systems are considered to be networked even if the network
connection is intermittent or occasional.&amp;nbsp; Examples include
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, medical
devices, computer peripherals, communication devices, and vehicles, and
the many consumer devices that make up the &amp;ldquo;Internet of
Things&amp;rdquo;. A report in January of 2014 by Proofpoint[1]
indicated that about 25% of a spamming botnet was from the Internet of
Things, including at least one refrigerator.&amp;nbsp; Networking these
embedded systems enables remote retrieval of diagnostic information,
permits software updates, and provides access to innovative features,
but it also introduces vulnerabilities to the system via remote
attack.&amp;nbsp; As these systems continue to grow more numerous, more
complex and more interconnected, so will the need for automatic
identification and response to vulnerabilities in these systems,
distributed throughout our critical infrastructure networks and
systems.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tAMENDED TOPIC (as of May 1, 2014):&amp;nbsp; A
study by Cui and Stolfo [2] showed that an extensive number of
unsecured, embedded, networked devices exist that are trivially
vulnerable to exploitation by remote attackers. Furthermore, a 2012
report by McAfee Labs [3] predicted that in 2012, industrial threats to
SCADA systems and industrial controller systems (ICS) will mature and
that embedded hardware attacks will widen and deepen. Operational
availability has taken precedence over security in this community. This
state of SCADA systems was confirmed in the 2013 report by Secunia [4].
The state of the practice of security for traditional IT systems is
anti-virus scanning, intrusion detection systems, and a patching
infrastructure. This approach does not work well for embedded systems
for a variety of reasons, including its focus on known vulnerabilities
and the fact that security code can itself introduce new
vulnerabilities. Embedded systems impose additional difficulties, such
as strict resource constraints, hard real-time performance requirements,
 reliability over long periods of time, and the need for extensive
verification and validation before patches can be installed
[5].&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tAMENDED TOPIC (as of May 1, 2014):&amp;nbsp;
Embedded system research has lagged behind general IT security research
[6].&amp;nbsp; Some progress has been made in the last few years, but at
 best we have only kept up with the problem, the net outcome is
essentially unchanged. DHS seeks to develop novel technology for
automatically detecting and automatically patching vulnerabilities in
networked, embedded systems. The technology should represent practical
and effective techniques that can be applied to a wide-range of embedded
 system platforms that will increasingly be employed across the various
infrastructure sectors. In addition, the techniques should be versatile
such that it can be implemented on systems externally networked by
various mechanisms, including, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, radios, etc. This
technology will lead to more resilient and secure embedded systems used
in critical infrastructure, medical, transportation and other
sectors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Manual techniques for detecting and
patching vulnerabilities are not within the scope of this topic and
should not be submitted for consideration.\n\n\tAMENDED TOPIC (as of May
 1, 2014):&amp;nbsp; This SBIR effort is focused on the near-term needs
of critical infrastructure systems and components, which is different
than the focus of related work at DARPA (longer term and higher risk),
NSF (foundational research that will support future improvements), and
Military Service R&amp;amp;D organizations (near-term needs of military
systems and components).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tAMENDED TOPIC (as of
May 1, 2014):&amp;nbsp; The offline analysis and data-mining of features
 of large firmware image populations encourages a hybrid approach for
vulnerability identification using host based monitoring capabilities on
 the device, in conjunction with offline static analysis of code and
data.&amp;nbsp; Fuzzing is one approach to incorporate dynamic analysis
of embedded systems, and has successfully been used for some device
types, such as cell phones, to identify some vulnerabilities that are
not detected with static code analysis.&amp;nbsp; The hybrid approach
fits the off-line analysis envisioned in this request, rather than
pipeline approach concepts needed to repair firmware exploited inside
running embedded devices.&amp;nbsp; This hybrid approach (using fuzzing
or other appropriate techniques and host based run-time defense) will
enable:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1.&amp;nbsp;
mitigation or prevention of potential run-time
threats;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2.&amp;nbsp;
offline modification of firmware to either remove or replace vulnerable

and\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4.&amp;nbsp; using
host-based capabilities to dynamically react to real-time information
generated by a large population of embedded devices acting as
sensors.\n\n\tAMENDED TOPIC (as of May 1, 2014):&amp;nbsp; With the
scope, complexity and dynamics of embedded software found throughout our
 national infrastructures and their various systems, hybrid approaches
will be needed to address the vulnerabilities of these kinds of
systems.\n\n\tPHASE I:&amp;nbsp; AMENDED TOPIC (as of May 1,
2014):&amp;nbsp; Develop novel techniques for automatic detection and
automatic patching of vulnerabilities in networked, embedded systems
that are offline for one or more applications. Required Phase I
deliverable includes monthly progress reports, a final report that
details the proposed techniques, the level of vulnerability expected to
be achieved by the techniques, the specific systems or types of systems
that the technique(s) will benefit, the basic architecture or design to
implement the intended approach, and the anticipated amount of software
development required.\n\n\tPHASE II:&amp;nbsp; AMENDED TOPIC (as of May
1, 2014):&amp;nbsp; Demonstrate that the techniques from Phase I can be
practically and effectively applied to any general networked, embedded
system connected by any external means, such as, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
radios, etc.&amp;nbsp; These offline devices may only connect
intermittently or occasionally.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Required Phase II
deliverables include all documentation for the developed techniques;
full architecture\/design supporting the implementation; software or
prototype(s) that will be demonstrated on multiple networked, embedded
system platforms; monthly reports; and a final report describing the
effort, including a description of remaining work to commercialize the
prototype.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPHASE III:&amp;nbsp; COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT

full-scale pilot in one or more civil\/commercial applications, such as
SCADA systems, medical devices, computer peripherals, communication
devices, and vehicles. Required deliverables include a commercial
service, or a technology product that can be commercialized in the
private sector. For example, this technology can be integrated into a
larger security software product suite (i.e., McAfee, Symantec) and
would represent a specialized tool that can be applied specifically on
networked, embedded systems that are offline, as opposed to current
security tools designed specifically for traditional IT
systems.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n",

 Platforms for Computed Tomography (CT)-based Explosive Detection
Equipment",
        "description": "\n\tOBJECTIVE:&amp;nbsp; Develop a
cost-effective reconstruction computing platform to perform iterative
reconstruction for computed tomography (CT)-based explosive detection
systems.\n\n\tDESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; All fielded computed tomography
(CT)-based explosive detection systems (EDS) in the United States create
 images using analytic reconstruction methods such as filtered
back-projection or the direct Fourier method.&amp;nbsp; The
reconstruction computing platforms (RCP) for these systems reconstruct
images in real-time, meaning that systems are able to continuously scan
bags without having to wait for the RCP to complete a bag.&amp;nbsp;
Recent research using data from EDS equipment has shown that iterative
reconstruction techniques (IRT) yield improved image quality (IQ)
compared to the analytic reconstruction methods.&amp;nbsp; The improved
IQ will lead to improved automated threat recognition (ATR) with
increased probability of detection (PD) and decreased probability of
false alarms (PFA).&amp;nbsp; That, in turn, may accommodate further
expansion of the detection envelope (new threats or reduced mass
quantities).&amp;nbsp; However, IRT requires thousands of times more
computational operations and memory access than analytic reconstruction
methods.&amp;nbsp; Therefore a RCP that supports real-time
reconstruction using IRT will need more hardware and software
capability, or algorithm compromises that may degrade IQ.&amp;nbsp; In
order to advance the deployment of IRT, the DHS Science and Technology
Directorate is seeking to investigate methods to develop a
cost-effective RCP for implementing IRT.&amp;nbsp; The following three
methods may be considered for this project: (1) reducing the of number
of mathematical operations and memory accesses in IRT; (2) developing
methods to achieve equivalent IQ as IRT using other reconstruction
methods such as raw data processing or image processing; and (3)
applying IRT to selective regions of bags or only on bags that are sent
to secondary inspection such as on-screen resolution.&amp;nbsp;
Techniques other than these three methods may be used.&amp;nbsp; In
Phase I of the project, an IRT method shall be implemented based on
publically available descriptions of algorithms that may have been used
to reconstruct data from EDS systems.&amp;nbsp; Research shall be
performed to identify possible methods to develop the cost-effective RCP
 that preserves most of the IQ of the publically available version of
IRT.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPHASE I:&amp;nbsp; Implement a version of IRT, which
 has shown to improve the IQ of scans of bags, based on algorithm
descriptions in the public domain.&amp;nbsp; Investigate methods to
develop a cost-effective RCP based on software, algorithmic and hardware
 solutions.&amp;nbsp; The deliverables include a technical report that
describes methods to develop a cost-effective RCP.\n\n\tPHASE
II:&amp;nbsp; Design and implement a cost-effective RCP and associated
IRT.&amp;nbsp; The implementation may include software, algorithmic and
hardware solutions.&amp;nbsp; Deliverables include a technical report
providing proof that a cost-effective RCP can be implemented that
preserves most of the IQ of the publically available version of
IRT.\n\n\tPHASE III:&amp;nbsp; COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT
APPLICATIONS:&amp;nbsp; The RCP can be sourced by vendors of EDS
equipment or the associated technologies can be transferred to the
vendors on the payment of royalties.&amp;nbsp;\n",

Hazard Zone (NHZ) Evaluation",
        "description": "\n\tOBJECTIVE:&amp;nbsp; Develop a portable
monitoring system that directly measures laser exposure relative to
Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) limits for the evaluation of
established Normal Hazard Zones (NHZs) for eye safety
considerations.\n\n\tDESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; The safe use of laser-based
technologies to solve numerous challenges faced by the Department of
Defense (DoD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is of
immense interest. The American National Standards Institute&amp;rsquo;s
(ANSI), Z136.1-2007 consensus standard, provides recommendations for the
 safe use of lasers and laser systems that operate at wavelengths
between 0.18 micrometers (&amp;micro;m) and 1 millimeter (mm).&amp;nbsp;
 It provides guidance on how to derive NHZs based on specific laser
parameters.&amp;nbsp; Laser exposure levels beyond the boundaries of the
 NHZ are sufficiently low (below MPE limits) that an unprotected person
may be exposed without adverse biological changes in the eye or
skin.&amp;nbsp; However, prior knowledge of specific laser
characteristics such as: emitted wavelength(s), power level, pulse
length\/repetition rates and beam geometry in addition to having someone
 capable of calculating the boundaries of an NHZ is required.&amp;nbsp;
Having a monitoring system that could either validate a calculated NHZ
or even automatically derive the NHZ based on direct measurements would
provide significant assurance that a fielded technology can be safely
operated.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tDHS is seeking a system that can directly
measure the radiant laser exposure of a laser beam, derive MPE limits
based on those measurements and be used to evaluate the boundaries of an
 NHZ.&amp;nbsp; The interrogation of an incident laser beam shall
provide all the necessary laser characteristics such as spectral,
temporal, geometric and radiant exposure levels for the system to
automatically derive MPEs consistent with the ANSI Z136.1-2007
standard.&amp;nbsp; DHS is seeking a single system capable of evaluating
 laser beams with wavelengths between 0.213 &amp;micro;m and 1
mm.&amp;nbsp; Higher priority will be given to system proposals covering
 broader wavelength ranges within these boundaries.&amp;nbsp; For
example, a single system operating between 0.213 &amp;micro;m and 1.2
&amp;micro;m would be considered more desirable than a similar system
operating between 0.213 &amp;micro;m and 0.8 &amp;micro;m.\n\n\tPHASE
I:&amp;nbsp; Demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technical
approach.&amp;nbsp; A laboratory demonstration, although not required,
is desirable.&amp;nbsp; The physical basis of the proposed detection and
 computation technology should be described.\n\n\tPHASE II:&amp;nbsp;
Develop and deliver two prototypes for third party testing on mutually
acceptable lasers within the 0.213 &amp;micro;m to 1 mm spectral
range.&amp;nbsp; Mutually acceptable lasers may operate with pulsed
and\/or continuous wave (CW) emissions, with average and peak powers (or
 pulse energies) that are commercially available.\n\n\tPHASE III:
COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In addition
to the numerous homeland security and defense applications, this
capability can be directly utilized to evaluate the safety of laser
systems used in academic research and more broadly in private
industry.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n",

        "topic_name": "Status Indicator for Downed Power Lines",
        "description": "\n\tOBJECTIVE:&amp;nbsp; Develop an indicator,
visual or otherwise, for electric power distribution cables that allow
nearby personnel to determine whether a downed power line is energized
or not, creating a safer environment and facilitating a more rapid
recovery following an event.\n\n\tDESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; The impact of
severe weather events on critical infrastructure can have devastating
impacts. With regard to the electricity subsector, 90% of all power
outages occur on the distribution system. Severe storms and natural
disasters can cause a variety of safety hazards including downed power
lines which create a dangerous environment for those working to recover
from the damages of a weather event.&amp;nbsp; To assist in restoration
and recovery efforts and reduce the number of lives lost, the DHS
Science and Technology Directorate is looking for ways to minimize
hazards and enable rapid recovery.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tDowned power lines may
 still carry live, high voltage electricity. Contact with a downed,
energized power line can cause severe injury or even lead to
fatality.&amp;nbsp; Safety is of utmost concern to the electric
utilities and the highest priority is given to calls regarding downed
power lines. Utilities also receive substantial calls for downed power
lines from the public that turn out to be other types of lines, such as
communications lines, that do not pose the same threat; however, they
still must respond to all such calls. Crews are immediately dispatched
to the affected areas to determine if the downed lines are power lines
and if they are energized.&amp;nbsp; If energized, the crew will cut
power to the affected area until the lines can be safely
restored.&amp;nbsp; This response can drain a utility&amp;rsquo;s
resources, particularly after a large event as they must tend to all
calls for downed lines, regardless of whether they are energized or not,
 before they can begin their damage assessment and restoration process
for restoring power to the community.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the first
responder&amp;rsquo;s ability to access areas with downed power lines is
 also hampered until a utility crew can physically come to the site to
verify that any downed power lines are de-energized and the site is
safe.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe goal is for a status
indicator device to determine if a downed line is energized or not and
relay that status information to the electric utility as well as provide
 that information to anyone who may be in the vicinity of the downed
line.&amp;nbsp; An example may be a sensor node in conjunction with a
visual or aural indicator.&amp;nbsp; The device should capture the
status of a downed line and if it is energized, an alarm, message, or
notification should be sent to the utility&amp;rsquo;s operations
center, in addition to providing an indication of hazardous conditions
to anyone in the vicinity of the downed line.&amp;nbsp; If the downed
line is not energized, the device must still provide a status both to
the utility and to anyone in the vicinity.&amp;nbsp; Therefore the
system must operate independently of and with minimum impact to the
power line.&amp;nbsp; The device\/system should also consider a
communication method that is reliable when the power may be
out.&amp;nbsp; The device must meet all applicable ANSI\/IEEE\/NESC
industry standards, as well as any applicable safety and environmental
standards. The device must be of reasonable cost.&amp;nbsp; It is
recommended that interested parties consult or partner with electric
utility companies as well as the first responder community to gain
further insight into the operational environment and resulting specific
requirements.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPHASE I:&amp;nbsp;
Evaluate the design of the status indicator and the system&amp;rsquo;s
functionality and feasibility in an operational environment.&amp;nbsp;
Complete and test the prototype subcomponent development to determine
the feasibility of the design.&amp;nbsp; The final technical report will
 document the status indicator design, evaluate subcomponent testing \/
modeling results, and provide a concept of operations
analysis.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPHASE II:&amp;nbsp; Fabricate and
test the prototype device system under various laboratory scenarios.
Revise and finalize the design based on test results. Prepare an
installation guide and\/or installation toolkit. The final deliverable
will be to install the device in an operational environment with a
partner utility.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPHASE III:&amp;nbsp;
 COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS:&amp;nbsp; Potential applications
 of the status indicator would be applicable for all overhead
distribution systems around the country. This solution could also
potentially be incorporated in the operations for the first responder
community.\n",

&amp;quot;man portable&amp;quot; device that will detect and quantify
levels of toxic gases, vapors, and particulates commonly found in the
post-fire environment.\n\n\tDESCRIPTION:&amp;nbsp; Fire Investigators
and other First Responders involved in a post-fire investigation require
 the ability to detect, monitor, and analyze the potential hazard fire
gases and particulates could pose to the health of the First Responders
at the scene.&amp;nbsp; Currently, the technologies most often employed
by firefighters to ascertain such risks are the four gas analyzers such
as the MiniRAE&amp;trade;[1], and a Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
 (GC-MS) such as seen in products like Hapsite&amp;trade;[2].&amp;nbsp;
Both technologies have several drawbacks when applied to fire
investigation.&amp;nbsp; For example, the four gas detectors have
limited capability (i.e., can only detect four gases), and GC-MS devices
 tend to be too large (~40 lbs), take too long for analysis
(approximately 10 minutes), and are cumbersome for use in a chaotic and
disordered fire environment.&amp;nbsp; In addition, the current
fieldable GC\/MS devices are able to analyze for vapor samples but not
particulates without some sort of sample preparation and typically do
not currently have in their libraries all the compounds of interest that
 are potentially present in a post-fire scenario.&amp;nbsp; GC-MS is an
analytical method which provides great analytical\n\tpower.&amp;nbsp;
However, these devices, such as Hapsite&amp;trade;, also have a cost
disadvantage when considering wide-spread fire department use, with
device costs starting at approximately\n\t$110,000.&amp;nbsp; A
lightweight, low cost portable instrument that can detect gases and
report on particulate load would be very beneficial for First Responder
use.\n\n\tThe portable or hand-held device shall be intrinsically safe,
small and lightweight with a goal of weighing less than 1 pound with a
threshold of less than 3 pounds.&amp;nbsp; It shall be able to work in
normal heat and cold conditions; operating from between 140\u25e6F to
-30\u25e6F temperatures, water-resistant, and rugged enough to withstand
 a drop test of a minimum of 10 feet.&amp;nbsp; The device shall be
small (goal of 4&amp;rdquo; x 3&amp;rdquo; x 1&amp;rdquo; with a
threshold of 6&amp;rdquo; x 4&amp;rdquo; x 2&amp;rdquo;) and ideally be
able to be adhered to or integrated with other First Responder Personal
Protective Equipment (PPE), such as the Self-contained Breathing
Apparatus (SCBA) or the Personal Alert Safety System (PASS).&amp;nbsp;
The device shall have a minimum of a 4-hour battery life and the
batteries required to operate the system shall be commercially
available.&amp;nbsp; If rechargeable batteries are used, there should be
 an ability to swap out off-the-shelf batteries if there is no time to
perform a recharge.&amp;nbsp; In addition, the long-term sustainment for
 the device&amp;rsquo;s sensors should allow for maintenance to be
conducted by the user rather than require manufacturer
involvement.&amp;nbsp; The price goal should be less than $1,500 per
unit, with a threshold of less than $5,000 per unit.&amp;nbsp; The
response time goal of the system should be less than 1 minute, with a
threshold of less than 5 minutes.&amp;nbsp; The device should provide
the capability for the user to immediately know about present dangers,
and include clear (preset) audible and visual alarm
indicators.&amp;nbsp; The display shall be readable in all light
conditions and should display only relevant data such as an indication
that the device is operating normally and\/or information concerning a
specific detection notification.&amp;nbsp; The device should include
displays for both current and cumulative exposure
levels.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe level of detection goal for the device shall
be within Permissible Exposure Limits (PEL).&amp;nbsp; The threshold for
 detection shall be Acute Exposure Guideline Level (AEGL) 2 at a
30-minute exposure.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe device shall, at a minimum,

thresholds\n\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPHASE I:&amp;nbsp; The Phase I effort
will result in a detailed technical report outlining the proposed field
detection and analysis device prototype.&amp;nbsp; The report shall
include the system objectives, proposed outputs, and mechanisms for
operation and interoperability with present-day incident command
processes and systems, as well as with firefighters&amp;rsquo;
self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).&amp;nbsp; The report must
include how the proposed analytical and logistical (i.e., size, weight,
cost, power requirements, etc.) approach is better than the commercially
 available detection systems.&amp;nbsp; The report must include possible
 risks to success and mitigation strategies to be deployed if those

characterizing the detection capability and observed detection limits of
 the chosen detection technology for the compounds in the above
list.\n\n\tPHASE II:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Based on the Phase I technical
report, a minimum of three prototypes will be developed that provides
timely situational awareness of an on-the-ground emerging

support systems so that data can be studied and managed
appropriately.&amp;nbsp; The government customer will work with awardee
to prepare a test plan for execution during this phase so that

        "description": "\n\t1. Research Objectives\n\t\n\tProteomics
continues to be a rapidly expanding field. However, despite explosive
growth in both academic and commercial efforts, concrete technical
capabilities are far from adequate to realize this promise. Proteomics
technologies and methods in the three broad, interacting domains of
biology, analytical chemistry, and informatics are still largely
inadequate to address the bulk of challenging biological problems. This
is the case with respect to both core capabilities and scale.\n\n\tThe
broad scope of proteomics can be broken down into six types of questions
 that are addressed in some form: (1) identification of individual
proteins, (2) recognition of protein interactions, (3) relative
quantitation to distinguish differential expression of proteins, (4)
characterization of post-translational modifications, (5) qualitative or
 quantitative measurements at high spatial and\/or temporal resolution
to address the dynamics of protein interactions, and (6) formulation of
models based on results from components 1-5.\n\n\tThe categories above
define the type of information being sought, and imply the need for
technologies capable of addressing the challenges inherent in each type
of experiment. Those specific technologies may reside within any of the
three domains that define proteomics, or may function as a bridge
between them. For example, tools for tissue or subcellular fractionation
 may reside squarely in the biological domain, but could also be
designed in such a way as to maximize synergy with widely used
analytical separations methods. It is important that in a field as
complex and interdisciplinary as proteomics, technology development be
pursued with a sound understanding of context. One area of particular
interest is the development of technologies that will permit
observations to be quantitative and made in real time, whether for
clinical studies or experimental systems.\n\n\tIn addition to the
development of broadly applicable research tools that address the core
technical challenges in proteomics, unique constraints in two
subordinate areas merit special attention. We especially encourage
applications in response to this announcement that address the unique
needs of glycomics and clinical proteomics, described below.\n\n\tThe
application of proteomics tools in the clinical setting lags far behind
their use in basic science and drug discovery. Though this is not due
solely to technological constraints, the unique challenges associated
with development of simple, rapid, and robust technologies for the
clinic demand a somewhat different perspective than might be taken in
consideration of a purely research-driven project. Likewise, this
difference in perspective and priorities should open the possibility of
approaches that might be wholly inadequate from a research perspective
but may be appropriate in the clinic. Finally, the exploitation of
insights previously developed in research-oriented proteomics to develop
 more specific, robust tools for clinical applications is also an
appropriate goal.\n\n\tThe complexity and diversity of glycosylation
significantly complicates the linkage between genetic sequence and
mature, active proteins. Glycobiology-focused proteomics, or glycomics,
requires the development of novel approaches and tools directed at the
special challenges of glycobiology. Among post-translational
modifications, glycosylation is the only one that requires structural
characterization of the modifying moiety beyond noting its presence.
Strategies for separation, profiling, quantitation, and detailed
characterization of carbohydrate structures are central challenges.
Informatics tools are needed for data handling and reduction,
correlation of carbohydrate and protein information, and a variety of
other purposes. Discovery-based analytical tools that can survey the
complexities of glycosylation on a system-wide basis may have
significant biological impact.\n\n\tThe goals of this program
announcement are deliberately discussed with respect to fundamental
challenges, rather than in relation to specific technologies, in order
to emphasize the overriding importance of surmounting obstacles,
irrespective of the analytical strategy adopted to pursue those
solutions. This solicitation is open to unconventional or alternative
approaches.\n\n\tSee Section VIII, Other Information - Required Federal

and controlling a process or environment is applicable to a wide variety
 of commercial and consumer-based endeavors. The ability to measure a
quantity and then affect a change to control that quantity, or a related
 quantity, is highly desirable in an innumerable number of scenarios
whether it be on the manufacturing plant floor or even within the home.
This type of monitoring and control functionality is being popularized

home automation technology into a hardware and software tool that
focuses on monitoring a residential heat pump is&amp;nbsp; one such

is the true economic and energetic cost of a particular fault?
and\n\n\t2) What is the statistical prevalence of important
faults?\n\n\tA recent NIST project to examine correlations of the
effects of different faults in a yearly simulation for two different
home types in 5 climate zones has provided insight to this topical area,
 however, additional research to fully understand the economic and
energetic cost of faults is necessary\n\n\tWith respect to the second
question previous studies in California and other Western States are
reported for various faults such as refrigerant charge and indoor
airflow [4]. However, a larger sampling of data from different climate
zones with some degree of statistical certainty is necessary. In
particular, the development of a measurement tool to gather data from a
large portfolio of residential systems, e.g., a datalogging tool, will
advance FDD methods.&amp;nbsp; An optimum tool should be easy to install
 with minimum invasiveness; economical and scalable; and able to
communicate its data over wireless and wired communication networks.
Moreover, an optimum tool should leverage existing home automation
technologies, be a modular design to allow for the expansion of
measurement inputs, and be applicable to a broad range of applications
monitoring varied pieces of equipment, processes, and\/or
environments.\n\n\tAn optimum tool is envisioned as being installable on
 indoor units and outdoor units, and should be able to handle the
appropriate environmental condition associated with these
environments.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Minimum functionality of such a device
 comprises: 1) a plurality of measurement nodes for temperature
distributed inside and outside of a building\/residence that is using a
heat pump; 2) a plurality of pressure transducers suitable for heat pump
 operations; 3) a plurality of suitable electrical measurement devices
for both voltage and current deployable at suitable locations relative
to fault occurrence; 4) appropriate analog to digital conversion; 5)
suitable communications capabilities (e.g., wireless 3G\/4G cellular;
802.11g; and hardwired TCP\/IP).&amp;nbsp; The optimum tool should be
able to store data for long periods of operation; provide adequate data
security; and preserve data in the event of power
failure.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe product of this SBIR project will be a FDD
datalogger tool which will allow detailed performance data collection on
 residential heating and air conditioning equipment.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This tool should be applicable to a broad set of
residential heat pumps in order to maximum the tool&amp;rsquo;s
applicability to collecting a wide range of field performance data. Data
 collection efforts will be designed with the aid of NIST statisticians
to ensure that the goal of determining fault prevalence is met with a
known degree of uncertainty.\n\n\tApplicants should have access to a
broad range of technical experts in the fields of consumer electronics,
air conditioning, and related fields, experts expected to provide input
toward the development of a practical FDD data logging tool. This input
should produce an effective device design at a cost deemed reasonable to
 the cost of the development of the tool.\n\n\tPhase I activities and
expected results: \n\tThe awardee shall create a design that performs
all of the necessary functions described above. If all functions cannot
be directly incorporated, the awardee shall re-define the criteria to
something buildable while meeting most of the previously listed
requirements.\n\n\tPhase II activities and expected results: \n\tIn
Phase II of the SBIR project, the awardee shall construct three
prototypes of the Phase I design for evaluation in the field, and
conduct field testing. NIST personnel will be involved with field
testing. During these prototype tests, the awardee shall work to refine
its interfaces, perfect communication protocols\/software tools, and
refine the design to remove any flaws.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tOn a case-by-case
basis, NIST may provide technical experts to work with Phase I and Phase
 II awardees for consultations and discussions to answer design
questions and clarify any other technical aspects within the field of
expertise.\n",

        "topic_name": "Cryptographic Acceleration for Border Gateway
Protocol Security (BGPSEC) ",
        "description": "\n\tThe Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) was
initially developed in 1989 (RFC 1105 [1]) and last refined in 2006 to
its current version BGP-4 (RFC 4271 [2]). Because the protocol itself
does not provide any notion of security, more and more successful
attacks against the protocol have been witnessed in recent years [3][4].
 The Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF) is currently developing two
mechanisms with the intent to strengthen BGP to be protected against
attacks (malicious or due to misconfiguration) such as route hijacks and
 redirects (i.e., AS-path modifications). These security mechanisms
being developed in the IETF, based on a Resource Public Key
Infrastructure (RPKI), are called route-origin validation [5] [6] and
path validation [7]. The new security enhanced BGP together with these
two mechanisms is known as BGPSEC (BGP with Security) [7].\n\n\tBGPSEC
relies heavily on cryptographic processing because it involves
cryptographically signing and verifying the BGP update messages. In
essence, BGPSEC requires real-time line-speed cryptographic operations
on BGP path announcements, and hence poses many challenges in
today&amp;rsquo;s routing landscape. The router control plane hardware
currently deployed in the field is not up to the task due to lack of
adequate processing power, especially for the cryptographic-intensive
computations in BGPSEC. The global Internet BGP routing tables consists
of approximately 500,000 routes (i.e., unique announced prefixes) with
re-convergence requirement of approximately 15 to 20 minutes following
router reboots. The current lack of any special purpose hardware for
cryptographic processing in routers poses a challenge for the hardware
vendors.\n\n\tNIST is heavily involved in the design of the new BGPSEC
protocol (i.e., route-origin and AS-path validation), and has developed a
 prototype validation software reference implementation [8]. There is a
critical need to research and develop mechanisms to use embedded or
off-board specialized cryptographic processors (e.g., any that may be
available off-the-shelf from vendors such as Intel, AMD, Cavium, etc.)
in routers so that future BGPSEC-enabled routers will be well equipped
to handle the required cryptographic-processing loads. Special
consideration needs to be given to router failure-recovery scenarios
when speed of convergence would be most critical. Cryptographic-hardware
 can be combined with innovative BGPSEC processing optimization
algorithms to further improve performance. It is important that
cryptographic acceleration can be added to secure routers in a cost
effective matter. Additional problems that also need to be addressed are
 minimization of power consumption, and efficient use of available
memory since there may be some limitation in increasing memory size in
routers.\n\n\tThe goal of the project is to research and develop an
efficient router platform that is capable of performing the
cryptographic operations associated with the evolving BGPSEC protocol.
The resulting router would perform said cryptographic processing at
nearly line speed even under router failure-recovery scenarios so that
the speed of BGP convergence can meet operators&amp;rsquo; stringent
requirements while still maintaining security. The resulting router
should be economically viable and commercially deployable in the near
future.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I activities and expected
results: \n\tPhase I consists of incorporating an embedded or off-board
cryptographic accelerator onto a PC-router platform using the NIST
BGP-SRx [8] reference implementation. An optimum design would enable the
 addition of cryptographic hardware accelerators to a PC platform to
completely off-load all cryptographic operations from the BGP-SRx
software prototype. The selection of cryptographic accelerator hardware
and software interfaces to BGP-SRx should be included in Phase
I.\n\n\tPhase II activities and expected results: \n\n\tPhase II
consists of developing and testing a prototype for the PC-router
mentioned above in Phase I activities. The prototyped router should open
 the doors for commercial deployment of BGPSEC, including route-origin
validation and AS-path validation.\n\n\tNIST will be available for
providing BGPSEC validation algorithms to be used in the router
implementation as well as to assist in designing the prototype
framework. The BGPSEC protocol standard has been only partially
developed in the IETF; the route-origin validation is specified while
the AS-path validation is still work-in-progress.\n\n\tOn a case-by-case
 basis, NIST may provide technical experts to work with Phase I and
Phase II awardees to provide assistance in keeping the awardee abreast
of the latest developments in the IETF and network operator community
regarding the BGPSEC protocol. NIST may also provide expertise to assist
 with the design of the integration into today&amp;rsquo;s routing
systems.\n",

        "topic_name": "Privacy Preserving Tools for Federated
Authentication Models ",
        "description": "\n\tLegacy Internet communication protocols were
 designed for secure communication in the Dolev-Yao model. This model
consists of two communicating parties and an adversary who can overhear,
 intercept, and synthesize any message. In this paradigm, the legitimate
 communicating parties only send messages to each other. No messages are
 sent to the third party, who is an adversary intent on preventing the
legitimate parties from achieving its goal.\n\t\n\tIn the last few
decades, software and standards have been developed which satisfactorily
 solve the above problem. Current digital transactions, however, occur
in a model that is very different from Dolev-Yao. Specifically, third
parties are not necessarily malicious and, in fact, often are an
important part of a multi-party communication protocol. These protocols
seek to enhance the digital world. In particular, they aim at
facilitating electronic commerce and other transactions in a
cooperative, rather than adversarial, model. Of course, we cannot simply
 assume bad actors away. The next generation of protocols needs to
replace &amp;ldquo;distrust&amp;rdquo; by &amp;ldquo;trust but
verify.&amp;rdquo; It seeks to use novel Internet technologies (see, for
 example, the NIST Beacon at
http:\/\/www.nist.gov\/itl\/csd\/ct\/nist_beacon.cfm).\n\n\tIn the
modern internet world, with its myriad players - customers, standards
bodies, industry, governments, privacy advocates, and many more - it
will be hard to effect this transition. But transition we must if we are
 to realize the potential of the Internet for improving our quality of
life and, from the United States perspective, our
competitiveness.\n\n\tHowever, industry and other actors often resist
modification to its deployed technologies. This subtopic is about
overcoming this critical barrier by focusing on test cases that are
representative of many scenarios and specific enough to allow
engineering of working solutions. So as to maximize the probability of
successful commercialization and adoption by industry, these solutions
should leverage existing Dolev-Yao protocols and standards by either
using them as black-box primitives or implementing minimal changes to
them.\n\n\tA primary objective is to develop tools that solve remote
authentication, identification, and attribute disclosure problems (e.g.,
 JSON, SAML, OpenID Connect, OAuth). A representative problem is the
&amp;ldquo;brokered identity problem,&amp;rdquo; in which there are
identity and attribute providers that, due to privacy considerations,
must issue assertions without knowing who the consumer of the assertion
is. For example, an attribute verifier does not need to know what
application the user is attempting to access. Signed assertions are
issued and sent to a broker, who in turn forwards them to the assertion
consumer, typically a service provider. It is fairly straightforward to
use two-party protocols such as SAML to solve this problem if we are
willing to allow the broker to read the assertions. However, it is more
complicated to solve this problem under the so-called &amp;ldquo;honest
but curious model&amp;rdquo; in which the broker follows the protocols
but anything that it learns becomes public knowledge. The recipient will
 specifically develop and test working technologies that solve attribute
 disclosure problems in a multi-party authentication architecture for
privacy preserving protocols outside the Dolev-Yao model.\n\n\tPhase I
activities and expected results:\n\tPick one or more representative
problems;\n\n\t\n\t\tResearch solutions from the cryptographic
literature; and\/or\n\t\n\t\tChoose candidate techniques and carry a
preliminary assessment of how these choices impact feasibility
vis-&amp;agrave;-vis compatibility with existing standards and industry
practice.\n\n\n\tPhase II activities and expected results: \n\tDevelop
working prototypes and work with NIST, the NSTIC NPO [1], and industry
to carry out feasibility tests and evaluations, with an eye toward
downstream commercialization.\n\n\tOn a case-by-case basis, NIST may
provide technical experts to work with Phase I and Phase II awardees for
 consultations and discussions to answer design questions and clarify
any other technical aspects within the field of expertise.\n",

        "topic_name": "Secure Email Agent Using the Domain Name System
(DNS) as a Trust Infrastructure ",
        "description": "\n\tEmail is widely used for Internet
communication both in dialogs between people and one-way messaging and
notification systems (e.g., Email from your bank noting a deposit).
However, email is inherently insecure and often spoofed by attackers
looking to impersonate another user, or institution, in order to trick a
 victim to download malware or view a malicious site. This type of
attack (often called &amp;quot;phishing&amp;quot;) has been used to
successfully infiltrate enterprises to steal sensitive data or leverage
other attacks [1]. The current state of Email security is considered so
poor that many financial institutions and government agencies tell their
 customers they will never send them unsolicited email and to distrust
all email purporting to come from their domain [2].\n\n\tThere are
standards developed by the IETF to provide authentication (via digital
signatures) and confidentiality (via encryption) to email through the
Secure\/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S\/MIME) [3]. S\/MIME
encryption uses asymmetric cryptography. A user&amp;#39;s public key is
usually stored in a digital certificate signed by its enterprise or a
provider&amp;rsquo;s Certificate Authority (CA). However, S\/MIME lacks
the ability to easily establish cross-domain trust. Users within an
enterprise can all configure a central trust anchor (to validate S\/MIME
 digital certificates), but may not be able to obtain and validate the
S\/MIME digital certificates of users in a different domain. For
example, employees of &amp;quot;agency.gov&amp;quot; would like to send a
 digitally signed email to users in &amp;quot;example.com&amp;quot;.
However, end users of example.com are not able to obtain (or validate)
the S\/MIME digital certificates of the agency.gov senders so they
cannot validate the signed messages. One way to make obtaining (or
validating) S\/MIME digital certificates possible is to use the Domain
Name System (DNS) as a public key distribution infrastructure.\n\n\tThe
DNS [4] [5] is a globally distributed, hierarchical naming
infrastructure that supports almost every other form of Internet
communication. A DNS query is usually the first step in communication
and is already currently used by the email protocol to find the proper
destination for email messages. The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [6]
 provides a means to protect the integrity of DNS data and provide data
authentication (i.e. that it comes from the authoritative domain
holder). This means DNS can be used as a lightweight distribution
channel for security information such as public keys or digital
certificates.\n\n\tNew DNS data types have been developed to store
digital certificates to support Transport Layer Security (TLS) for web
traffic (e.g., https) and other uses [7]. This new data type can be used
 as the model for another new data type [8] to store email digital
certificates. Email certificates require different features than simple
TLS certificates. Email security often involves two different
certificates: one for generating digital signatures and one for
encryption of email contents. The new DNS data type for email digital
certificates takes these differences into account, but otherwise it is
treated like any other DNS data.\n\n\tThe goal of the project is to
design, develop and test an extension to open source Mail User Agents
(MUA) to use the DNS to obtain and verify email digital certificates.
This extension could be a downloadable plug-in or a modified open source
 implementation that users can download and install on their own. This
modified MUA would have two new functions related to secure email:
First, the MUA, upon receiving a digitally signed email, would issue DNS
 queries to obtain additional information in order to validate the
certificate before using the certificate to validate the message
signature. Second, the MUA would have the ability to query the DNS to
obtain a receivers email encryption certificate (or public key) in order
 to send an encrypted email.\n\n\tProvisioning tools to format and store
 email digital certificates in the DNS are not part of this project, but
 may be developed to aid in the testing portion of the
project.\n\n\tPhase I activities and expected results: \n\n\tPhase I
consists of identifying possible candidates to use as the base code and
designing the algorithms to query the DNS for digital certificates and
how to interpret the response. MUA candidates are ideally open source
and either easily extendable via plug-ins (for example Mozilla
Thunderbird), or proprietary MUA software that has API&amp;#39;s
available to develop plug-ins that users can download and install
independently (for example, Apple Mail).\n\n\tPhase II activities and
expected results:\n\n\tPhase II consists of developing and testing a
prototype of the MUA plug-in to send and receive encrypted and\/or
digitally signed email. The MUA will use the DNS to obtain digital
certificates (or additional information to validate digital
certificates) used to sign email. The MUA will also use the DNS to
obtain the public encryption key of an email receiver and use it to
encrypt and send a confidential email message.\n\n\tOn a case-by-case
basis for Phase I and Phase II awards, NIST may provide technical
experts to act as subject matter experts in DNS, DNSSEC and email as
needed. NIST may also be available to establish the network and DNS
infrastructure that would be needed to conduct testing of the resulting
modified MUA. NIST has experience from previous DNS projects in setting
up test domains using newly specified data types.\n",

        "topic_name": "Silicon Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes with
Detection Efficiency that Exceeds 95 % ",
        "description": "\n\tRecent advances in quantum communications
and quantum random number generation have identified the critical need
for detectors with single-photon detection efficiency above bounds that
are determined by information theory. Additional losses in any preceding
 optical components require that the efficiency of the subsequent
detectors be even higher. Devices of this type may be used in verifiable
 random number generation, a critical need for cryptography and cyber
security [1]. Detectors with single-photon detection efficiency above 95
 % are generally considered suitable for these applications, though
higher efficiency is better. To date the only candidates that meet this
requirement operate at cryogenic temperatures, which significantly
increases the complexity and cost of any cryptographic apparatus based
on such processes. Devices of this type are also critical to advance
communications systems based on generalized quantum measurements [2],
which can discriminate low-photon-number states at errors rates lower
than those determined by the standard quantum limit.\n\n\tWhile there
are a wide variety of single-photon detectors, it has been demonstrated
recently that silicon single-photon avalanche diodes can achieve
detection efficiencies exceeding 80&amp;nbsp;% at some wavelengths,
while maintaining relatively low noise (less than 100 Hz dark count
rate) [2]. These advances are promising, and suggest that it may be
possible to achieve near unity single-photon detection efficiency in a
compact, low-cost device that requires only thermoelectric temperature
control. Such a device could be a critical component in the development
of a small-form-factor quantum-random-number-generation equipment. A
primary objective is the development of quantum random number generation
 for cyber-security and selective disclosure protocols, as well as an
ongoing commitment to quantum optics research and devices that enable
quantum information processing. More generally, high-efficiency
low-noise single-photon detectors play a critical role in applications
ranging from quantum cryptography and DNA sequencing, to 3D imaging
based on time-of flight ranging; technological advances in sensors that
operate at the fundamental limit to electromagnetic signal strength are
likely to have an impact in a variety of fields.\n\n\tThe award should
ultimately result in the development and demonstration of single-photon
avalanche diodes with single-photon detection efficiency somewhere in
the silicon region (roughly between 350&amp;nbsp;nm and
1100&amp;nbsp;nm) that exceeds 98 %, with an intermediate Phase I goal
of 95&amp;nbsp;%. In addition, noise is an important concern for
detectors for cyber-security applications. To this end, the intrinsic
dark count rate of the devices must be below 10 kHz, while the timing
resolution must be better than 1 ns (full-width at half maximum), or,
equivalently, the per-gate dark count rate should not exceed 10^-5+.
Otherwise, there are no requirements on the wavelength at which the
devices should operate, their maximum count rate, or their recovery
time, though a recovery time below 10 microseconds is
preferable.\n\n\tTo allow efficient optical coupling, the
device&amp;rsquo;s active area should have a diameter larger than 50
micrometers. Devices that meet all these requirements would represent a
significant advance in single-photon detection technology, and would
benefit not only cyber-security and quantum information applications,
but also the more conventional applications of high-efficiency
single-photon detectors such as fluorescence spectroscopy and
LIDAR.\n\n\tPhase I activities and expected results:\n\tDesign,
fabrication packaging, and testing and characterization of silicon
single-photon avalanche diodes with &amp;gt;95 % single-photon detection
 efficiency\n\n\tPhase II activities and expected results:\n\tAs in

Delivery of Vaccines ",

pulmonary system has received much attention in recent years for
addressing a variety of health issues &amp;ndash; in particular the
delivery of vaccines. Higher costs and increased chemical toxicity of
drugs under consideration are requiring more stringent dose delivery
criteria, and thus has affected inhaler design and development. Little
quantitative information on spatially or temporally resolved
concentration of a drug throughout the aerosol (i.e., presence of the
active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) within a particular liquid
droplet or solid particle) is available; concentration along with size
is critical for proper dosage and transport efficiency to the site of
action within the lungs.\n\n\tNIST has developed a measurement approach
to measure inhaler dose concentration of pharmaceutical-laden,
multiphase aerosols [1]. Since many biological molecules either are
naturally fluorescent or can be chemically modified with fluorophores,
one can relate fluorescence intensity to concentration (or mass) of
these inclusions within the droplet volume. The approach used
distinguishes between aerosol droplets that may or may not contain
fluorescing agent (i.e., to identify droplet-to-droplet variations in
agent concentration). Development of a functioning prototype instrument
is needed that integrates the measurement of particle\/droplet
fluorescence intensity with image splitting technology and magnification
 optics, as well as provides software algorithms to identify API-laden
droplets\/particles and statistical evaluates the overall API
concentration.\n\n\tFoundational capabilities to conduct this research
include: 1) image and record fluorescence and scattering intensity of
individual droplets; 2) determine API drug fluorescence by fluorescence
spectrophotometry; 3) prepare solutions with API to prove that natural
fluorescence can be used to identity API in a solution or mixture; 4)
image and distinguish fluorescent and non-fluorescent microspheres (of
comparable size to droplets in metered-dose or dry-powder inhalers)
using fluorescence microscopy; 5) extract and identify particle size,
scattering and fluorescence intensity from recorded images using an
already existing mathematical algorithm; and 6) form composite images of
 the combined scattering and fluorescence images.\n\n\tPhase I

phantom based on this design. Development needs include: lowering cost
through advanced manufacturing techniques, creating sterilization
techniques to ensure stability for a minimum of five years,
incorporating quantitative traceability into dimensional and magnetic
resonance properties, and writing software that overlays the phantom
structure with magnetic resonance images.\n\t\n\tProject
Goals:\n\n\t\n\t\tCost reduction: Current prototype phantoms cost
approximately $12,000 to construct. For successful commercialization we
require that the cost to the end-user be brought down to less than
$5,000. Cost reduction can be achieved by simplifying the phantom design
 (while retaining the prescribed functionality), reducing the number of
machined parts, integrating components, incorporated cost efficient
production techniques, or other
methods.\n\t\t&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\t&amp;nbsp;Improve phantom stability:
The phantom should be stable for at least five years. Five-year
stability requires all components to be sterilized so there will be no
bacterial or fungal growth within the phantom. Current designs utilize
corn syrup and other materials that are potential growth media for
bacteria. The diffusion and T1 inserts must be well sealed and their
properties and concentrations must be stable for at least five years.
The phantom should be robust enough to withstand shipment and at least
five years of normal use.\n\t\t&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tIncorporation of
quantitative traceability: A plan must be developed to insure
quantitative traceability for critical components of the phantom. This
includes traceable dimensional measurement of the resolution insets,
traceability of the chemical composition of the T1 and diffusion
components, and traceability of the T1 and T2 relaxation properties to
gold standard NMR measurements. NIST may provide assistance and guidance
 on best methods to insure
traceability.\n\t\t&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tAnalysis software: When imaging
these phantoms an overlay is required to identify the exact position of
the phantom components. Software is required to take the output of the
three-dimensional models used for phantom construction and provide an
output suitable for overlays in standard DICOM viewers. For the
commercial phantom (Phase II), a complete analysis package is required
to be disseminated with the phantom that can input DICOM images, overlay
 the designated regions of interest, process the data, and compare
measured parameters with prescribed parameters.\n\n\n\tPhase I
activities and expected results:\n\tRevise initial designs and develop
manufacturing process to lower cost to end-user:\n\tThe goal is a total
cost of $5000 or less per phantom. Prototype phantoms should be
constructed using low cost manufacturing techniques. A plan is required
to ensure measurement traceability of all key parameters. Traceable
measurements should be made on key components going into prototype
phantoms.\n\n\tDevelop sterilization plan and methods such that the
fabricated phantoms have at least five-year stability.\n\n\tPhase II
activities and expected results:\n\tMove toward manufacture of
commercial breast phantoms: test performance of lower cost prototype,
make final revisions with input from the breast MRI community, and
produce breast phantoms for distribution. It is expected that at least
six phantoms will be distributed to the user community in exchange for
testing and feedback. A compact software analysis package will be
developed to be distributed with the phantom to allow users quick
feedback on their imaging protocols and image quality. A full
distribution package will be designed that will include the phantom,
analysis software, environmental site monitoring (e.g., temperature of
the phantom during imaging), and any infrastructure required to ship the
 phantom and precisely load the phantom into various scanners and RF
coil assemblies.\n\n\tOn a case-by-case basis, NIST may provide
technical experts to work with Phase I and Phase II awardees for
consultation, input, testing of prototype phantoms and solutions, and
analysis of data collected from the user community. NIST may provide any
 needed clarification to the phantom specifications currently posted on
the public TWIKI listed below, and NIST may be available for
consultation and input.\n",

Absolute 3D Imaging ",
        "description": "\n\tReal time, three-dimensional (3D) imaging is
 needed by industry for both machine vision and monitoring of
manufacturing processes. Today&amp;rsquo;s 3D imaging equipment have
significant technical limitations: poor image resolution, low refresh
rate, as well as a lack of rigorous, calibrated distance measurements,
which render the equipment inadequate for high-quality measurements in
today&amp;rsquo;s challenging manufacturing environments.\n\n\tNIST has
demonstrated a novel, prototype 3D self-calibrated laser radar (LADAR)
imager. The NIST 3D LADAR imager is capable of non-contact, absolute
dimensional measurements from distances as far as 5 m away.&amp;nbsp;
Measurement of complicated 3D objects, such as parts and assemblies on a
 manufacturing line, or footprints and other unstable trace evidence in
forensics investigations are expected potential uses for this
technology. The NIST prototype can be improved upon further, and can
potentially be used with a number of different potential LADAR
techniques.\n\n\tAn optimum LADAR instrument would be cheaper, easier to
 build, and easier to use, and also be more compact and have a faster
refresh rate. A significant technical barrier to such an instrument is
the lack of an appropriate, compact laser scanner. In existing LADAR
systems, the laser beam is scanned across the target surface through
mechanically actuated mirrors that are based on bulk optics packaged
within a much larger device. A compact LADAR would be possible if this
conventional scanner could be replaced by a compact electro-optic
scanner.\n\n\tThe combination of a compact, electro-optic scanner with a
 LADAR approach that exploits modern laser technology, including
frequency combs, would result in a compact 3D LADAR imager with
extremely high performance. This imager could be used to qualify
physical parts on manufacturing lines, enabling absolute multiscale
dimensional measurements of parts and assemblies up to one meter in size
 at resolution of one micrometer or better. These methods, and the
knowledge gained by using them, will reduce manufacturing costs, and
accelerate the adoption of metal additive technologies, by enabling
real-time qualification of additive manufacturing parts for
mission-critical uses.\n\n\tThe twin goals of a cooperative project are
to transfer NIST 3D LADAR technology to the private sector, which, in
turn, requires a party to develop a compact, rapid electro-optic (EO)
laser scanner that would make this technology more commercially viable.
The EO laser scanner will be used to steer a swept laser across an
object of interest. A commercial feasibility EO laser scanner must steer
 a swept laser with at least 5 THz of laser bandwidth, and it must be
capable of sweep transit times of 0.5 ms or less. The center wavelength
of the EO laser scanner should be 1550 nm, and it must have a clear
aperture of 1 cm or greater. The EO laser scanner must be able to
operate with bidirectional light to support a monostatic LADAR
configuration. Most importantly, the EO laser scanner must contain no
mechanical parts, thus enabling robust operation within manufacturing
environments that may involve exposure to large temperature swings,
mechanical vibration, or other environmental changes that could cause
misalignment of mechanical parts.\n\n\tThrough this subtopic, the
development and demonstration of a commercial sale 3D LADAR system (or
systems) based on NIST&amp;rsquo;s technology, which includes several
proof-of-concept LADAR technologies, will be developed. For additional
information please see the NIST Fiber Sources and Applications website
http:\/\/www.nist.gov\/pml\/div686\/sources_detectors\/fiber.cfm.\n\t\n\tPhase
 I activities and expected results:\n\n\t\n\t\tDesign a two-dimensional
electro-optic scanner that can enable near-diffraction-limited scanning
over an instantaneous bandwidth of &amp;gt; 1 THz (defined as an excess
beam spread of less than 20&amp;nbsp;% diffraction limit), in a 1 cm
FWHM beam, over 10&amp;nbsp;mrad of angular range, at sweep transit
times of less than 0.5&amp;nbsp;msec, and with insertion loss of less
than 6&amp;nbsp;dB. The design for the overall dimensions of the
instrument should be 50 cm3or less.\n\t\t&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tConduct
necessary laboratory tests to verify the design with a particular
emphasis on the instantaneous bandwidth, beam size, number of
&amp;ldquo;spots&amp;rdquo; (defined as the angular range divided by the
 diffraction limited angular spread), and insertion
loss.\n\t\t&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tConduct preliminary measurements and
become familiar with the NIST technology available for use in a complete
 LADAR system, which would be a significant component of a Phase II
application.\n\t\t&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tConclude Phase I with a report
that describes, in detail, the approach to laser electro-optic scanner,
including calculations and data on how the electro-optic approach will
meet specifications on sweep times, angular deviation, output beam
diameter, beam divergence, insertion loss, and instantaneous optical
bandwidth.\n\n\n\tPhase II activities and expected
results:\n\n\t\n\t\tBuild an electro-optic two-dimensional
scanner.\n\t\t&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tTest and validate the scanner within
existing NIST LADAR hardware prototypes.\n\t\t&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tCreate
 design concepts and develop a rapid 3D LADAR imager for commercial

experts to work with Phase I and Phase II awardees to work
collaboratively and to provide existing information regarding tradeoffs
in EO scanner performance to optimize its capabilities for 3D imaging.
NIST expects to provide limited testing by incorporating any prototype
EO scanners into an existing NIST LADAR imager. NIST may provide

\u2013 A Software Tool to Automate Standards Development Process ",
        "description": "\n\tThe design and development of standards is a
 long and tedious process. This process is often hampered by
requirements to keep complex terminology consistent and keeping its
associated information content current. The implementation and adoption
of standards is slowed by the gap between the technical requirements in a
 standard and the technology required to implement those requirements.
This SBIR subtopic seeks a software tool that will make the design and
development process faster, more robust, and more integrated. The tool
will be similar to a Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool,
but applied to standards development and deployment. The tool will
provide the following facilities for standards development and
deployment:\n\n\t\n\t\tCategorize and organize standards&amp;rsquo;
content in a structured information model, supporting modularization and
 reuse.\n\t\n\t\tEstablish terminology connections between related
standards, and maintain semantic consistency across
standards.\n\t\n\t\tGenerate a visual representation and navigation
scheme for the standard, so that the standard may be communicated to the
 end user through interactive means (such as a touch-screen
tablet).\n\t\n\t\tProvide an underlying formal model that is amenable to
 testing and verification, and that facilitates the implementation of
the standard by automatic or semiautomatic generation of software
modules. This should allow software implementers to extract portions of
the standard to meet specific implementation
requirements.\n\t\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\tStandards development organizations
 (SDOs) and the scientific and engineering societies that participate in
 those organizations will benefit greatly from such a tool. Vendors will
 benefit from the tool since it would pull from the existing standard,
populate the tool, and allow a consistent assessment for the vendor to
identify the requirements.\n\n\tThe life-cycle of a standard may involve
 the following three broad stages [1]. First is the development stage
where stakeholders gather within committees, prepare a draft, and come
to a consensus on a final standard. The second stage is the deployment
stage where a pilot implementation is undertaken by some consortia
followed by industry wide implementation. The third stage is the
maintenance stage where the standard is revised and maintained. A
well-defined underlying information structure\/model will also
facilitate the implementation of all three stages. In addition, it can
support the instantiation and communication of the standard to the end
users using the varied digital media available today.\n\n\tEven though
information management and software tools have advanced considerably
over the recent decades, SDOs rarely take advantage of those
advancements. One area in which such advancements can help is in
managing the terminology contained in standards. To address this issue,
we need a framework for developing a taxonomy for the terminology and
concepts contained in a standard. Another way is in capturing the
requirements of a standard in a formal model. A third way is to produce a
 standard as a structured information model, instead of a simple text
document. This can be supported by additional tools to automatically
verify these models for consistency, and generate other artifacts such
as documents and software implementation modules. All of these will be
supported by tools that will allow standards developers and end-users to
 interactively view and navigate the information models. Such technology
 will greatly improve the deployment, adoption, and maintenance of
standards.\n\n\tThe outcome of this effort will bring together SDOs,
software implementers, and end-users (both manufacturers and their
consumers) together under a single framework, and allow them to exchange
 standards information in an unambiguous and efficient manner. While the
 focus of this project will be related to standards in manufacturing,
the general methodology is applicable to other industry
sectors.\n\n\tPhase I activities and expected results:\n\n\t\n\t\tExpand
 on the NOVIS tool [2,3] to develop a taxonomy editor for standards.
This should include a classification scheme and underlying ontology
modeling the concepts and relationships.\n\t\n\t\tDevelop a formal
representation scheme to capture the requirements for a standard. This
may be based on the FACTS work [4].\n\t\n\t\tDevelop an export\/import
mechanism for the information content of a standard and associated
document formats.\n\n\n\t\n\tPhase II activities and expected
results:\n\n\t\n\t\tDesign an initial architecture and software for
realizing computer aided tool for standards
development.\n\t\n\t\tDevelop a Computer Aided Standards Development
(CASD) tool and a comprehensive case
study\/demonstration.\n\t\n\t\tDesign an interface between CASD tool and
 document generation software, in the form of a plug-in to a document
editor that interfaces with the underlying CASD model.\n\t\n\t\tDesign a
 mechanism for automatic or semiautomatic generation of software to
implement modules of the standard as per requirements.\n\t\n\t\tA
framework for a standards repository where the standards may reside as
information models. The framework should support version control, cross
standard linking, and maintenance of information consistency across
standards.\n\n\n\tOn a case-by-case basis, NIST may provide technical
experts to work with Phase I and Phase II awardees to consult and
provide inputs and work closely with awardees to assess their
progress.\n",

        "description": "\n\tThe primary objective is to develop a
narrow-band, tunable, diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) pulsed laser
system operating in the eye-safe infrared region around 1.6 micrometers
in wavelength. Such laser systems are in demand for remote sensing of
fugitive emissions, which can cost millions of dollars to industry, as
well as for sensing and mitigation of pollutants for regulatory
requirements and research. These applications demand high repetition
rates (1&amp;nbsp;kHz &amp;ndash; 10&amp;nbsp;kHz) and high-energy
(&amp;gt;1&amp;nbsp;mJ) pulses.\n\n\tCurrently available commercial
technologies for generating laser light in this region include
telecommunications lasers using erbium-doped fibers, and optical
parametric oscillators pumped by two additional laser systems. The
former are limited in pulsed power output by nonlinear processes within
the fiber, and the latter are complex and limit the field-portability of
 remote sensing instruments. The development of a system with orders of
magnitude higher pulse energy than telecommunications lasers and lower
complexity than optical parametric oscillator-based systems is necessary
 to advance these limitations.\n\n\tDiode-pumped solid-state lasers
using erbium ions embedded in a crystal matrix (such as YAG or YVO4),
which have emission lines in the appropriate spectral region, have been
developed and demonstrated to be suitable for both high-energy and
high-repetition rate pulse production[1-6]. The grantee will develop and
 commercialize a system, or set of systems, optimized for remote sensing
 applications.\n\n\tThe project outcome should be a turnkey,
environmentally robust DPSS Er-ion based laser system with high mode
quality, high pulse energy, and high repetition frequency. The pulse
duration should be in the tens of nanoseconds and the linewidth should
be as close to transform limited as is practical. A state-of-the-art
optical parametric oscillator based system can generate pulses of
several tens of mJ at a 100&amp;nbsp;Hz repetition rate when pumped with
 a high-power Nd:YAG [7]. The project outcome should have comparable
pulse energies and have a variable repetition rate exceeding 1 kHz and
not exceeding 20 kHz. The laser should be capable of being reconfigured
for a variety of spectroscopic lines and targets (for example, the 1570
nm CO2absorption range as well as the 1645 nm CH4range). There should
also be fine tunability of the laser to densely sample points across a
typical absorption feature. This tuning could be achieved, for example,
by seeding with a tunable diode laser.\n\t\n\tPhase I activities and

        "topic_name": "Precision Specimen Control for Transmission
Scanning Electron Microscopy ",
        "description": "\n\tThe primary objective is to significantly
extend the capabilities of the scanning electron microscope (SEM), a
tool considered invaluable for characterizing materials and products in
numerous forms of manufacturing. Examples range from extremely
fine-scale structures found in nanoparticle production and semiconductor
 processing to large-scale structures used for transportation and
infrastructural applications. The efficiency and quality of all
manufactured products depends intimately on the ability of engineering
materials to perform their intended function. Those functions are a
direct result of the properties imparted upon each material due to the
arrangement of its atoms over dimensional scales from sub-nanometer to
several hundreds of micrometers. It is therefore critical to product
manufacturing and reliability that the microscopic structure of
materials be precisely measurable over those size scales.\n\n\tA rapidly
 emerging area of material characterization makes use of the detection
of electrons that have transmitted through specimens within an SEM, in
order to significantly improve spatial resolution and image contrast
over many conventional SEM and transmission electron microscope (TEM)
methods. This approach makes use of some operational principles
analogous to those used in scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM), and is therefore sometimes termed
&amp;ldquo;STEM-in-SEM&amp;rdquo;. NIST is developing SEM-based
technologies that make use of transmitted electrons in ways different
from TEM-based STEM imaging, resulting in a broader characterization
approach we call transmission SEM, or t-SEM.\n\n\tCritical to the
success of developing reliable quantitative material analysis methods
based on detection of transmitted electrons in the SEM is the precise
control of specimen position inside the SEM chamber. Quantitative
analysis requires the microscope operator to position a specimen under
very precise, well-defined (in terms of crystal directions as determined
 by electron diffraction) incident electron beam conditions, independent
 of that detector&amp;rsquo;s location. Existing SEM positioning systems
 are insufficient for the required level of control because (i) the
detector itself mounts onto the stage, precluding independent movement
of the specimen, (ii) the specimen cannot be tilted eucentrically, i.e.,
 the transmitted electron image translates unacceptably during tilting,
and\/or (iii) the SEM stage itself gets in the way of detectors for STEM
 imaging and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD).\n\n\tSuccessful
development of the required type of specimen control in the SEM would
represent a major leap forward in advancing STEM-in-SEM (t-SEM)
capabilities for quantitative analysis of materials. Two major benefits
to manufacturing could result: (1) a host of powerful analytical
material characterization methods would be brought within reach for
those presently without access to TEMs, due to budgetary or personnel
constraints, and (2) a new, broader spectrum of measurements will be
achievable with relatively inexpensive modifications or add-ons to
existing SEM investments, as compared to state of the art TEM purchases.
 As a result, manufacturers may perform detailed measurements for
product optimization, as well as meaningful root-cause failure analyses,
 both from the key perspective of structure of engineering
materials.\n\n\tThe following five goals must be met in order to
consider this project successful:\n\n\t\n\t\tA method to hold a thin,
fragile specimen, in the form of a circular, 3 millimeter diameter TEM
grid, within an SEM, centered on the microscope&amp;rsquo;s optic
axis.\n\t\t&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tPrecise operator control over specimen x
and y translation (where z coincides with the optic axis of the
microscope), as well as control over the incident beam direction (i.e.,
specimen orientation) within the specimen coordinate system (see
activity number 2 for more detail).\n\t\n\t\tThe positional control
method must allow for the insertion of a STEM detector within the
microscope, i.e., the specimen must reside and its position must be
controllable within the available space between the bottom of the SEM
pole piece and the top of the STEM
detector.\n\t\t&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tThe positional control method must
allow for the insertion of an existing EBSD camera on the
microscope.\n\t\t&amp;nbsp;\n\t\n\t\tThe positional control method, when
 not in use, must allow for conventional SEM studies.\n\n\n\tPhase I
activities and expected results:\n\tNOTE: any hardware design to enable
control of specimen position for transmission imaging must also allow
for conventional SEM operation. In other words, since NIST&amp;rsquo;s
instrument is not dedicated solely to transmission SEM mode, the
hardware must either: (i) be removable from the SEM, or (ii) be
&amp;ldquo;placed aside&amp;rdquo; within the chamber to accommodate
normal operations.\n\n\t1. Specimen translation. Choose or develop a
method for positioning a TEM specimen within the (x, y) plane beneath
the SEM pole piece with a minimum step size of 250 nm or better.
Specimen translation may be controlled either manually or in a motorized
 manner.\n\n\t2. Specimen orientation. Choose or develop a method
compatible with that in activity number 1 that allows for control of the
 incident electron beam direction (i.e., specimen orientation) within
the specimen coordinate system via specimen manipulation; typically this
 is done in the field of TEM specimen control via either: (i) two
orthogonal tilt axes (&amp;ldquo;double-tilt&amp;rdquo;) OR (ii) one
tilt axis plus one rotation axis (&amp;ldquo;tilt-rotate&amp;rdquo;).
The primary tilt axis must both: (a) have a tilt sensitivity of 0.5
degree or better, and (b) lie within the thin specimen plane to maintain
 a practically manageable degree of eucentricity. Specimen orientation
may be controlled either manually or in a motorized manner.\n\n\t3.
Compact design. Design the method combining control of specimen
translation and incident beam direction (via e.g., double-tilt or
tilt-rotate) to fit within the space between the bottom of the pole
piece and the top of the inserted STEM detector. For our particular
microscope and STEM detector combination (a LEO 1525 with a KE
Developments 3-channel dark-field\/bright-field detector), the distance
between the bottom of the pole piece and top of the detector is 15 mm.
From a broader commercial perspective, this distance will vary somewhat
depending on the microscope manufacturer and STEM detector technology
available.\n\n\t4. Interface to operator. Design a port adapter and\/or
feed-through system that can accommodate any necessary connections
external to the microscope chamber. The port adapter and\/or
feed-through must allow for concurrent use of an existing EBSD camera
mounted beneath the EDS and WDS ports on our microscope. We have unused
ports available that should allow this.\n\n\tExpected results: by the
end of Phase I, a design should be submitted for review by NIST. The
design should be complete except for exact machining dimensions. It
should describe the translation mechanism and minimum translation step
size, and the mechanism for controlling incident beam direction while
maintaining a manageable degree of eucentricity. The design must be
feasible for incorporation into our SEM. Approximate dimensions may be
provided at the end of Phase I, and refined dimensions can be addressed
during Phase II.\n\n\tPhase II activities and expected results:\n\t1.
Refinement of the design and construction of a prototype specimen
holder\/control system with port adapter and\/or feed-through that fits
our microscope.\n\n\t2. If the Phase I design results in a novel
specimen holder that is to be introduced each time transmission SEM is
to be performed, determine feasibility of introducing an airlock to
accommodate the holder.\n\n\tExpected results: by the end of Phase II, a
 NIST t-SEM operator should be able to mount a TEM specimen into the new
 system, translate it to a desired position with 250 nm or better
accuracy, observe a transmission Kikuchi electron diffraction pattern
with the EBSD camera, and tilt and\/or rotate the specimen to a desired
crystallographic orientation. Finally, the operator must be able to
observe the transmitted image with the existing STEM detector.\n\n\tOn a
 case-by-case basis, NIST may provide technical experts to work with
Phase I and Phase II awardees for consultations and discussions to
answer design questions and clarify any other technical aspects within
the field of expertise.\n\t\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n",

 for real-time adjustments during manufacture.\n\n\n\tIndustry currently
 relies heavily on the manufacturing of coupons to qualify metal parts
created using additive manufacturing processes. Physics-based models
promise to provide the ability for industry to move away from relying
solely on testing and towards an environment supported by models and
simulation. The transition to modeling and simulation for part
qualification is underway, albeit very cautiously and deliberately.
Current qualification through modeling and simulation is achieved only
with very specific models deployed under very specific
circumstances.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe goal of this project is to develop a
tool that will support the broader application of physics-based models
as a means for product qualification. This will be achieved by
developing sets of composable models, each model accompanied with clear
application boundaries. These models must be composable to a level of
granularity that microstructure, and to an extent performance, can be
predicted to a degree of certainty, for a given set of process
parameters irrespective of geometry. This tool will be an early step in
allowing industry to move away from 100% testing and towards part
qualification that is able to rely more on modeling and
simulation.\n\n\tAs additive manufacturing becomes increasingly popular,
 many institutions, especially universities and small companies, do not
have the resources to test each part created. Nor do these institutions
have the resources for developing reliable predictive models.
Development for this tool will focus on support for composable modeling
for metal powder bed fusion processes, including direct metal laser
sintering and selective laser melting, though the principles applied
during its development should support broader
applications.\n\n\tTherefore, one goal of this project will be to
provide a foundation for developing similar tools in the future for
other processes, including those that build parts using polymer-based
processes.\n\n\tThe awardee(s) will develop the fundamental measurement
science for this predictive tool. This will support development of a
tool necessary to support composable predictive modeling for
manufacturing with metal powder bed fusion processes, similar to how
finite element analysis is used in conventional machining.\n\n\tPhase I

 experts to work with Phase I and Phase II awardeesto consult, provide
inputs, and work closely with awardees to assess their
progress.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t[1]Composability is a system
design principle that deals with the interrelationships of components. A
 highly composable system provides recombinant components that can be
selected and assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific user
requirements. The essential attributes that make a component composable
are: 1) it is self-contained (i.e. it can be deployed independently-
note that it may cooperate with other components, but dependent
components are replaceable). 2) it is stateless (i.e. it treats each
request as an independent transaction, unrelated to any previous
request) (see Reference [1] in Section 9.04.05.73R of this

(CNTs) hold great promise for a number of technological applications of
strategic importance, including future digital electronics beyond

the lack of purity of CNTs with well-defined electronic and optical

 that aqueous two-phase (ATP) extraction is a scalable and
cost-effective solution to this long standing problem. Automation of the

turn the NIST finding into an industrial manufacturing process. This

        "topic_name": "Ultra-sensitive and Wide Dynamic Range, Cavity
Ring-down Spectroscopy System for Detection of Ozone ",
        "description": "\n\tThe Standard Reference Photometer for Ozone
(SRP) has met the need for an ozone standard for National Metrology
Institutes (NMI) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) since
1980. The instrument is based on UV optical spectroscopy and
1980&amp;rsquo;s electronics. The inherent problems with this technology
 are long term stability, sensitivity, and noise. As we go forward,
there is an unmet need for an instrument that would provide the
stability, sensitivity and accuracy to become an intrinsic standard for
ozone, the Primary Standard. The technology could also be somewhat
downgraded to be mass produced into instruments for field use to monitor
 ozone in the environment, the secondary standard.\n\n\tNIST is
interested in the development of this new instrument to replace the
1980&amp;rsquo;s technology SRP with one that has better sensitivity,
stability and low noise. This would produce results that are accurate
and precise for the world&amp;rsquo;s NMIs, and support the regulatory
and measurement needs for ozone. From this molecule, other
environmentally important chemicals could also be in reach.\n\n\tThe
project goal is to develop an ozone sensitive measurement tool with the
ability to measure in the range of 0.1 micromole per mole (ppm) to 5000
micromole per mole (ppm) with an uncertainty of less than 0.5 %
relative. The instrument should be stable in reading ozone from a stable
 source to within 0.5% over one year.\n\n\tThe NIST SRP is not capable
of measuring ozone below 1 ppm, and thus cannot calibrate field
instruments in this range. In order for NIST and other NMIs to support
these measurements, a stable and reliable instrument is needed that can
measure down to 0.1 ppm or lower. The uncertainty of these measurements
must be low enough to accommodate the natural uncertainty expansion of
secondary instruments. Thus the uncertainty must be 0.5 % relative or
better.\n\n\tOther industries also require ozone traceability. Emissions
 from process streams can be very high, and must be monitored. The upper
 concentration limit of the instruments must accommodate these needs as
well. The upper limit of 5000 ppm was chosen to reach a majority of
these applications. However, some processes go beyond even this limit,
e.g. when ozone is used to sterilize components. Some needs for
traceability exists for these applications as well, however they may
need to be covered by a different instrument.\n\n\tLong term stability
is required in order to demonstrate that this instrument can meet the
stringent requirements of an intrinsic standard. An intrinsic standard
is one that can be defined as a Primary Standard in its own right, due
to the traceability of its signal to known principles that have defined
uncertainties and no known biases. Therefore the concentration derived
from the signal can be derived without reference to an external
standard. The cavity ring-down design is one where an intrinsic standard
 is possible, however long term stability must be measured, and be as
low as possible. The 0.5 % relative drift over one year is a maximum
allowed drift for the instrument to be useful as an intrinsic standard.
The instrument must also remain accurate, so that drift must be random
about the true concentration of ozone.\n\n\tThe primary objective is to
design, construct and test a cavity ring-down spectrometer suitable for
measuring 1 &amp;ndash; 5000 ppm of O3in air. Because of the need to
span these O3concentrations, the spectrometer must have a wide dynamic
range. This can be achieved either by probing different spectral regions
 of O3to access both relatively weak and strong absorption cross
sections, through gas dilution methods, or by realizing a dynamic range
of 50,000:1 or more at a given wavelength. The spectrometer should use
robust, commercial single-frequency laser technology; for example
distributed feedback diode lasers (DFBs) or external cavity diode lasers
 in the visible and\/or near-infrared regions. Measurements near 600 nm
could access the Chappuis-band (peak cross section of
5&amp;times;10-21cm2) yielding an absorbance of ~10-6for a 75-cm long
cavity given 0.1 ppm of O3in air. This absorbance level would be ~750
times greater than the estimated detection limit assuming standard
low-loss mirrors (20 ppm) and 0.02% relative uncertainty in the measured
 time constant. However, at this wavelength, measurements on 5000 ppm of
 O3, would require that the sample be diluted by a factor of ~500 to
ensure that the sample is not optically thick. Alternatively, or in
parallel the spectrometer could be operated near a wavelength of 1.8
&amp;micro;m, which would give a peak absorbance of
~1.5&amp;times;10-5for 5000 ppm and ~3&amp;times;10-10at 0.1 ppm. The
small absorption value corresponding to 0.1 ppm would be challenging to
measure, but it is within demonstrated cavity ring-down detection limits
 and would mean that dilution would not be required.\n\n\tPhase I
activities and expected results:\n\n\tPhase I involves the design and
construction of a laboratory table-top instrument. The principal Phase I
 deliverable should demonstrate O3detection over 0.1 &amp;ndash; 5000
ppm range with one integrated instrument.\n\n\tPhase II activities and
expected results:\n\t&amp;nbsp;Phase II involves the development of a
fully integrated prototype spectrometer. This system should be
rack-mountable, incorporate fiber-based components when possible and be
temperature-regulated (0.01 K maximum variation) to ensure long-term
stability. The final prototype will include all necessary optical,
gas-handling, instrument control and data acquisition
systems.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tNIST

initiative is to incentivize small businesses to generate tools and
products specifically for monitoring and manipulating covalently
modified eukaryotic&amp;nbsp; mRNAs and regulatory
RNAs.\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tCovalent chemical modifications can play a
crucial role in regulation of biological processes.&amp;nbsp; For
example, post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and
lipidation are critically important for regulating protein
functions.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, modifications to histone proteins and to
 DNA itself are critical for epigenomic regulation of gene
expression.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tSome covalent RNA modifications such as
5&amp;rsquo;mRNA capping, alternative splicing, and polyadenylation have
 been well studied, however the functional roles of many covalent RNA
modifications are poorly understood.&amp;nbsp; The RNA Modification
Database indicates that there are at least 65 RNA modifications that
occur in eukaryotic cells.&amp;nbsp; Transfer and ribosomal RNA can be
heavily modified, however a number of these covalent modifications also
occur in messenger RNA.&amp;nbsp; For example, recent studies have
identified N6-methyladenosine sites in thousands of human mRNAs and
suggest that this modification may play a role in regulation of
alternative splicing and gene expression.&amp;nbsp; It also appears that
 this RNA methylation mechanism is important in regulating the circadian
 clock.&amp;nbsp; Interestingly, the FTO gene has been found to
enzymatically demethylate N6-methyladenosine in RNA.&amp;nbsp; FTO was
originally identified in a human obesity genome-wide association study
and is expressed in the hypothalamus.&amp;nbsp; FTO also appears to
regulate the demethylation of mRNAs leading to alterations in dopamine
function in the midbrain and striatum.&amp;nbsp; Although the functions
of N6-methyladenosine are becoming clearer, the relevance and function
of other naturally occurring RNA modifications are poorly
understood.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, oxidative processes may generate
covalent RNA modifications that are associated with disease states or
aging.\n\n\tRNA editing is a process in which certain RNAs are modified
by adenosine deaminases (ADARs).&amp;nbsp; ADAR post-transcriptional
editing can modify adenosine to inosine, leading to alterations in
translated proteins that are not coded for by our DNA genomes.&amp;nbsp;
 ADAR isoforms are expressed dynamically during brain development and
ADAR loss can lead to deficits in synaptic function.&amp;nbsp; RNA
editing might enable neurons and glia to modify their properties in
response to energy fluctuations or environmental changes.&amp;nbsp; Some
 researchers have linked the editing of serotonin 2C and TPH2 mRNAs to
psychiatric diseases.&amp;nbsp; The extent to which RNA editing occurs
in small or long non-coding regulatory RNAs is poorly described, but
could potentially impact their regulatory functions.\n\n\tAdditionally a
 novel class of RNAs, the circular RNAs, have recently been discovered
in the brain and other tissues.&amp;nbsp; It appears that a circular
splicing mechanism may be used to convert linear RNAs into RNA
circles.&amp;nbsp; Although the functions of circular RNAs are not well
understood, there is evidence that some circular RNAs may be able to
function as microRNA sponges and thus impact microRNA regulatory
pathways.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tResearch Objectives\n\n\tDespite the growing
interest in and likely importance of RNA modifications, the available
tools that scientists have to monitor and manipulate modified RNAs are
extremely limited.&amp;nbsp; The purpose of this FOA is to stimulate
small businesses to begin to develop robust tools specifically for
monitoring and manipulating covalently modified eukaryotic mRNAs and
regulatory RNAs to enable the scientific community to effectively
explore this new scientific area.&amp;nbsp; In particular, it is hoped
that these tools and products for monitoring and manipulating modified
RNAs will serve as the foundation for NIDA-relevant research into the
potential roles of RNA modifications in both HIV infection\/progression
as well as into the molecular mechanisms of substance abuse disorders
and co-occurring psychiatric disorders.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tTwo companion
FOAs have been released in this scientific area:&amp;nbsp; DA-15-002
describes the R41\/R42 mechanism, while this FOA (DA-15-001) describes
the R43\/R44 mechanism.&amp;nbsp; If the innovative tool to be
commercialized will be developed via a partnership of ideas between a
small business and an academic\/non-profit research institution, the
program director\/principal investigator should consider applying using
the STTR mechanism (R41\/R42).&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, small businesses
interested in the development of relevant innovative technologies are
encouraged to apply via the SBIR mechanism
(R43\/R44).&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExamples of Potential Tools or
Products.&amp;nbsp; This initiative will support small business
development of research enabling tools and products such as (but not
limited to):\n\n\t\n\t\tAntibodies or other affinity reagents for
detection, quantitation, or immunoprecipitation of modified RNAs, or
enzymes that write, erase, or bind to these
modifications;\n\t\n\t\tAssay systems or reagents that facilitate the
discovery, detection or quantitation of modified RNAs, circular RNAs, or
 edited RNAs;\n\t\n\t\tThe development or adaptation of nanoscale

values of the national park system. However, the NPS road network,
especially in urban areas is facing congestion issues like those seen
around the country.&amp;nbsp; State Departments of Transportation are
applying operational strategies to help manage this increasing concern
which can be applied NPS roads. Thus, unobtrusive traffic monitoring
devices of low profile, with minimal impact to the natural surroundings
are needed to assess vehicular flow on two- to four lane
Parkways.&amp;nbsp; Information on vehicle speeds, travel times
(multiple directions), vehicle type, and volume per lane. Surveillance
for incident management response is also important.&amp;nbsp; It is
desirable that a strategy for this data to be transmitted to the
regional ITS architecture and stored, analyzed and possibly operated and
 maintained by a state agency.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe device should be
 developed in a way that allows the FHWA and NPS personnel, involved in
this study, to closely monitor it.&amp;nbsp; Use of the George
Washington Memorial Parkway (GWMP) maintenance facility and the TFHRC
site for preliminary testing of the prototype devices in Phase I and II
is required. &amp;nbsp;Cooperation with nearby jurisdictions such as
VDOT and MDSHA and their groups that monitor transportation data is
recommended so that transfer of data to their systems can be
analyzed.&amp;nbsp; The GWMP extends 26 miles between Mount Vernon
Estates on the south end to I-495 intersection at the north end. Both in
 pavement and above pavement sensing technologies may be applicable.
However, the final packaging must be visually unobtrusive and blend in
with the scenic views of the parkway.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThis proposal
 is also in alignment with USDOT goals of ensuring safety and spurring
innovation.&amp;nbsp; Park roads and Parkways in the National Capital
Region have 39% of all the crashes that occur in the NPS.&amp;nbsp; The
data obtained with this innovative device will allow the NPS to more
comprehensively analyze and address traffic safety and deploy a 4

crashes.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tConstraints:&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tDevice should
have:\n\n\t\n\t\tMinimal impact to viewsheds or disturbance of the
historical, cultural landscape. The NPS Cultural Landscape Inventory can
 provide guidance on viewsheds within the study area.\n\t\n\t\tSmall
profile. If an In-Roadway sensor, the portion of the sensor, not
embedded in the roadway, shall be capable of being deployed and operate
on existing road signs -and light poles. If an Off-Roadway sensor, the
same deployment restrictions apply.\n\t\n\t\tIf an Over-Roadway sensor,
the sensor shall be capable of being deployed and operated on median
piers of existing bridges and shall be visually
unobtrusive.\n\t\n\t\tSelf- powered capability (long-life batteries
preferred over solar panels). There is currently no power or
communications sources along the right of way of the
Parkway.\n\t\n\t\tData fusion between 2 or more technologies is
permitted but is not required.\n\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase I
Outcomes:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe expected outcome of Phase I is the
development of a prototype that can be deployed for testing on the GWMP
facility.&amp;nbsp; Testing may include a groundtruth comparison to an
existing sensor station or approved radar system.&amp;nbsp; Develop a
report on key findings and recommendations for modifications.&amp;nbsp;
In the report include, background information on approach to problem
statement, project goals and development of device, review of testing
and data collection, description of evaluation methods, and
conclusions.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase II
Outcomes:\n\n\tThe expected outcome of Phase II is a device or product
that has been deployed and tested at multiple locations on the GW
Parkway and proven to generate consistent, accurate results.
&amp;nbsp;The accuracy of counts between locations and the accuracy of
the travel time estimates between the locations will be
evaluated.&amp;nbsp; Strategies for transferring data from the sensor to

 Measurement of Railroad Rails ",
        "description": "\n\tA common measurement for quantifying aspects
 of railroad track geometry is the mid-chord offset (MCO).&amp;nbsp; MCO
 measurements enable railroads to maintain their track to safe standards
 that comply with federal regulations.&amp;nbsp; In order to obtain MCO
measurements, railroad personnel (as well as federal and state
inspectors) use string line measurements to measure right and left rail
deviations in both the vertical and lateral plane.&amp;nbsp; Figure 1
shows the typical configuration of an MCO measurement.&amp;nbsp; One end
 of the string line is placed at a first point, and the second end is
placed a distance xaway from the first point.&amp;nbsp; The MCO
measurement is taken at the center point of the string line, and the MCO
 measurement is the distance between the string line and the rail at the
 center point of the string line.&amp;nbsp; Federal regulations call for
 the use of 31 foot, 62 foot, and 124 foot string line
lengths.&amp;nbsp; At the longer stringer line lengths of 62 feet and
124 feet using a string line is problematic due to the
&amp;ldquo;droop&amp;rdquo; effect of the
string.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThis topic solicits proposals for the
development of a compact, portable mid-chord offset rail measurement
system that leverages advanced technologies to overcome the difficulties
 of longer chord length string line measurements The system must be
lightweight (preferably less than 10 lbs), portable, and include a
portable power source that can provide power for at least 10 hours of
intermittent use.&amp;nbsp; The system may consist of multiple
sub-systems or units; for example, the system might consist of a first
sub-system placed at a first point, a second sub-system placed at a
second point (64 feet or 124 feet away from the first point), and a
third sub-system placed at the center point between the first and second
 subsystems.&amp;nbsp; The device must be easy to use; preferably system
 setup and data collection could be performed by a single
person.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe scope of research projects for this

 exit from Freight Locomotives several time per trip in the course of
the workday. This entails walking on ballast on a slope. Steps allow the
 worker to climb up to the first step and the remaining steps to the

conjunction with the locomotive movement at slow speeds. This is
&amp;ldquo;risky&amp;rdquo; business and many slips and falls can occur.
 Grab handles facilitate this climb up. The process is not ergonomically

        "topic_name": "Development of Prestressed Concrete
Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) Inspection Procedures",
        "description": "\n\tApproximately 66% of existing concrete
bridges consist of prestressed concrete components (calculated by deck
area).&amp;nbsp; Prestressed concrete is constructed using either pre
tensioned or post tensioned steel tendons as tensile
reinforcement.&amp;nbsp; Similar to traditional reinforcement (rebar),
these tendons experience degradation due to corrosion and
carbonation.&amp;nbsp; However, unlike typical structural concrete,
prestressed concrete is more difficult to inspect using nondestructive
evaluation techniques.&amp;nbsp; This difficulty arises from the fact
that tendons cannot be easily distinguished from other reinforcement,
are inaccessible, and are often encased in ductwork.&amp;nbsp; There is a
 need for new and improved methods, techniques, and technologies to
efficiently and effectively inspect these
components.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThere are multiple existing methods to
inspect prestressed concrete components.&amp;nbsp; These methods
include, but are not limited to, the nondestructive evaluation (NDE)
techniques of magnetic methods (magnetic flux leakage (MFL) and the main
 magnetic flux method (MMFM)), acoustic methods (impact echo, impulse
response, etc.), and nuclear methods (gamma ray and x-ray).&amp;nbsp;
Although these methods have proven some successes, there reliability and
 reproducibility is
limited.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tAdditionally, there are a
variety of structures and structural elements that are comprised of
prestressed concrete.&amp;nbsp; This population includes a variety of
configurations.&amp;nbsp; These configurations range from pretensioned
concrete girders and slabs to post tensioned concrete girders and column
 caps (this list is not all inclusive).&amp;nbsp; The pretensioned
concrete is comprised of steel tendons that are incased in concrete and
are typically surrounded by a dense mesh of traditional
reinforcement.&amp;nbsp; Post tensioned configurations typically contain
 tendons incased in long ducts.&amp;nbsp; These ducts are either incased
 in the concrete structure or run from adjacent piers on the internal
sections of hollow shaped girders (box girders, pie girders,
etc.).&amp;nbsp; Thus, it is easier to inspect ducts that are not
incased in material.&amp;nbsp; There are currently very few procedures
to inspect any of these configurations, especially post tensioned steel
tendons incased in concrete.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe Federal Highway
Administration&amp;rsquo;s (FHWA) NDE and Long Term Bridge Performance
(LTBP) programs have identified, through coordination with key
stakeholders, that the improved investigation of prestressed concrete is
 of great importance to the infrastructure of the United
States.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase I
Outcomes:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe objective of this phase is to
identify new and improved methods to inspect prestressed concrete
nondestructively.&amp;nbsp; The outcome expected from Phase I is a
detailed concept that demonstrates the viability of creating a prototype
 that satisfies the issues identified above.&amp;nbsp; The four areas of
 concentration should be:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\t\tInspection of
tendons incased in concrete (typical of pretensioned concrete
configurations),\n\t\n\t\tInspection of grouted tendons in ducts incased
 in concrete (typical of post tensioned concrete I beam girder and pier
cap configurations),\n\t\n\t\tInspection of grouted tendons in ducts not
 incased in concrete (typical of post tensioned concrete hollow girder
configurations), and\n\t\n\t\tA risk based approach to inspection of
prestressed concrete that will determine element level inspection
criteria and assign ratings to each element with regard to high
probability of failure and subsequent high consequence of
failure.&amp;nbsp; This approach would result in a rating system to be
used by bridge inspectors to determine the frequency of required
inspection of prestressed concrete elements.\n\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe
inspection procedures should focus on identifying cross section loss of
individual tendons as well as variation in grout density, if
possible.&amp;nbsp; Phase I deliverables should include a demonstration
proving the method is field deployable with a high probability of
detection.&amp;nbsp; This demonstration should include a statistically
significant number of trials showing a high percentage of true positives
 and true negatives with a low percentage of associated false positives
and false negatives proving the probability of detection using this
method.&amp;nbsp; Only methods with a high probability of detection will
 be granted Phase II awards.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase II
Outcomes:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe Phase 2 outcomes build upon the
lessons learned in Phase 1 and will result in a full optimization
development of the NDE methods identified in Phase 1.&amp;nbsp; The
final product would be a technology and associated deployable equipment
that could be used for inspection.&amp;nbsp; This technology and
equipment would include all appropriate analysis software and decision
making framework that could be used by state bridge inspectors to
determine the level of section loss of a prestressed
tendon.&amp;nbsp;\n",

        "topic_name": "Personalized Driving Data for Insurance Discounts
 &amp;amp; Public Benefits",
        "description": "\n\tTraditional car insurance rates vary little,
 if at all, based on mileage and observed driving safety, even though
they clearly and directly relate to crashes and claims, and charging
based on actual risk exposure would improve safety and the environment,
reduce energy use, and lessen crash-caused congestion. Brookings
Institution research shows that pay-as-you-drive insurance (PAYDI) would
 lead to an 8% reduction in driving. Other research points to crash
reductions, and likely claims&amp;rsquo; reductions, that would be about
 1.4 times that amount, typical infrastructure improvement savings of 3
to 5&amp;cent; for every mile not driven, and between $50 and $60
billion in net social benefits in the U.S. from reduced driving related
externalities, including congestion reduction that has been shown in
many instances to be disproportionately greater than the reduction in
traffic. ( For example, the Oct. 22, 2008 INRIX report, &amp;ldquo;The
Impact of Fuel Prices on Consumer Behavior and Traffic
Congestion,&amp;rdquo; concluded that the price spikes led to a 26%
reduction of peak-hour congestion, resulting from a much smaller
reduction&amp;mdash;i.e., around 3%--in vehicle-miles
traveled.)&amp;nbsp; Brookings also projects that 63.5% of households
would save an average of 28% on their total premiums or about $496
annually for the households that do save, which would be a huge economic
 stimulant.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe ability to monitor
driving activity for the purpose of improving safety has grown
exponentially in recent years.&amp;nbsp; While some personal lines
insurance products have begun to use observed exposure data for premium
setting, the tremendous potential for PAYDI applications to lead to
substantial public and private benefits, and opportunities for small and
 mid-size businesses, is nevertheless not being
realized.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe suggested approach to improve this
situation entails enlisting small and mid-size
businesses&amp;mdash;including vendors of in-vehicle telematics
equipment&amp;mdash;to work with personal lines insurance companies and
environmental and consumer groups to gather data needed for competitive
PAYDI pricing.&amp;nbsp; An industry is emerging in the U.S. and
internationally to combine telematics and car insurance.&amp;nbsp;
Indeed, the &amp;ldquo;Insurance Telematics USA 2013&amp;rdquo;
conference in Chicago attracted another sellout crowd of 500
participants.&amp;nbsp; The market today for PAYDI telematics
technologies and services has technology and data providers selling
services and products directly to insurance companies, and the data is
not in turn offered back to consumers in a format that would enable them
 to solicit competitive PAYDI rates as they are able to solicit for
traditional car insurance.&amp;nbsp; The result is that the dominant
insurance company products that include PAYDI elements offer rates that
are informed by driver data, but such data remains in a &amp;ldquo;black
 box&amp;rdquo; to consumers who might otherwise want to share them with
 competitors to secure lower premiums. The public policy benefits of
having consumers appreciate how their driving affects their rates
(including the number of miles driven in congested conditions) and then
being provided an opportunity to change behavior to save on premiums is
lost because of how the market is developing.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, there
 is a need to create a marketplace that would enable consumers to
collect and share their own driving data linked to crash
risk&amp;mdash;including about driving amounts, conditions (e.g.,
related to congestion and time of day), and vehicle handling (e.g.,
prevalence of hard braking)&amp;mdash;which would enable insurance
carriers to offer competitive and comparable PAYDI rates.\n\n\tThe
product described will satisfy FHWA strategic goals related to system
performance, congestion reduction, environmental stewardship, and
safety.&amp;nbsp; In addition, it is anticipated that this project may
be of interest to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection
Agency for Phase II funding.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase I
Outcomes:\n\n\tOutcomes expected from the Phase 1 include a detailed
concept that demonstrates the viability of one or more consumer
telematics products and systems from which at least three insurance
companies agree to accept the data to offer competitive
premiums.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase II
Outcomes:\n\n\tPhase II efforts would include demonstrating a working
prototype (which may or may not include the manufacturing of a new
product) of an in-vehicle telematics device, linked to a data
integration and warehousing system, that would gather and inform
consumers of their driving data and enable consumers to share such data
with insurance companies in exchange for competitive pricing and
guidance on reducing risk.\n",

Robotic Engineering to the Sub-Surface",
        "description": "\n\tPoles supporting overhead utilities in the
right-of-way represent a significant safety hazard for drivers and
occupants of vehicles.&amp;nbsp; While other hazards exist on the
roadside, vehicles that crash into these utility poles typically suffer
serious damage and increase the risk of serious injury or death for the
occupants.&amp;nbsp; Over 1,000 fatalities each year are attributed to
crashes involving utility poles.[1]&amp;nbsp; Relocating overhead
utilities in the right-of-way below the ground surface eliminates this
safety hazard, improves the aesthetics of the roadway and adjoining
properties, and can increase the reliability of the utilities.&amp;nbsp;
 However, the cost of relocating existing overhead utilities to the
subsurface often prohibits any large scale adoption of the
practice.&amp;nbsp; Innovative technological advances may afford the
opportunity to significantly reduce this highway safety
hazard.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe most significant issue in underground
relocation of utilities beyond the cost is avoiding existing subsurface
utilities and other obstructions.&amp;nbsp; Particularly in corridors
with a cluttered subsurface such as in urban environments, the precise
location of existing utilities is often unknown.&amp;nbsp; Even in cases
 where as-built drawings or other documentation exists, the accuracy and
 precision may not be good enough to reliably place additional utilities
 and avoid conflict with existing ones.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tRapidly
developing technologies to reliably sense existing underground
conditions and the location of existing underground utilities integrated
 with increasingly affordable robotic technologies may offer a promising
 and cost-effective solution to the dilemma of relocating overhead
utilities.&amp;nbsp; Nondestructive inspection techniques such as ground
 penetrating radar and thermography can be combined with more
traditional location approaches such as magnetic field detection to more
 accurately locate existing utilities.&amp;nbsp; In cases where trenches
 are open, advanced 3-dimensional data capture with LiDAR or
photogrammetric techniques also provides accurate location information
that can be combined into a common 3-dimensional digital model of the
subsurface.&amp;nbsp; Significant progress on the detection, location,
and mapping of existing underground utilities has been made under the
2ndStrategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2) and research conducted by
FHWA and the highway construction industry.&amp;nbsp; These models will
provide the necessary information on existing conditions to support
accurate placement of overhead utilities into the
subsurface.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tTo minimize cost and disruption,
trenchless methods for utility relocation will be required.&amp;nbsp;
Horizontal directional boring technology is relatively mature for
applications that do not require very accurate 3-dimensional positioning
 of the drill head. &amp;nbsp;Advances in guided directional drilling
and microtunneling techniques promise significant improvements in
accuracy that may be sufficient and provide the necessary accuracy and
control to place utilities in a complex subsurface environment that is
characterized by a sufficiently accurate 3-dimensional
model.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe desired outcome of the proposed research
 is a system that can robotically relocate existing overhead utilities
to the subsurface in highway and road rights-of-way. The system should
be accurate and precise enough to place utilities in complex subsurface
environments such as those found in urban corridors.&amp;nbsp; The
robotic installation system will depend on an accurate 3-dimensional
model of the subsurface that is derived from state-of-the-art remote
sensing technology combined with existing information about buried
utilities.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase I
Outcomes:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tPhase I will explore and identify
existing technologies that are capable of, or can be adapted to, the
robotic installation of underground utilities. Similarly, Phase I will
also examine current and emerging subsurface utility sensing and mapping
 technology to identify the most applicable technique(s) to exploit for
use with a future automated subsurface utility relocation
system.&amp;nbsp; Lastly, this phase will determine the feasibility of
integrating the identified subsurface sensing\/mapping methods with the
robotic technology to form a complete, automated subsurface utility
relocation system.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase II
Outcomes:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tBuilding on the information developed in
Phase I, Phase II will produce a prototype system that can be
demonstrated in a realistic environment by robotically installing
utility cables in the subsurface where utilities and other obstructions
already exist.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t[1]National Cooperative

as&amp;nbsp; millions of gross tons (MGT).&amp;nbsp; As rails age, they
are more susceptible to developing rolling contact fatigue.&amp;nbsp;
Rolling contact fatigue can lead to rail internal defects which, in
turn, can lead to rail failure and a train derailment.&amp;nbsp;
Therefore, knowing the &amp;ldquo;age&amp;rdquo; of a rail, the number

Prestressed Concrete Bridges",
        "description": "\n\tThe number of prestressed concrete bridge
structures utilizing high strength 7-wire strand (black strand) has
increased steadily since the 1970s. The prestressing strand can be used
in both the pre-tensioned and post-tensioned (PT) structures. Two years
ago, the University of Texas completed a study where they evaluated
various types of prestressing to determine their corrosion-resistance,
including black strand as a control. The study concluded that epoxy
coted strand performed somewhat better then stainless-clad and stainless
 steel for both corrosion resistance as well as mechanical properties.
Despite these good results on epoxy coated strands, there are number of
practical issues for their use in field, and owners are reluctant to
adopt this product at present.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tFor post-tensioned
structures, the stressed strands are enclosed in plastic or galvanized
ducts and the ducts are filled with cementations grout to provide a
barrier system to the enclosed strands. Unfortunately, a number of
bridges have still had corrosion issues due to bleed water from the
grout being collected at higher end anchorage areas, among other
problems including issues with construction, quality control, and
environmental concerns. Hence to avoid the inherent deficiency in the
cementations grouts, it is desirable to study feasibility of alternate
metallic 7-wire strands including epoxy-coated, copper and stainless
clad, stainless steel, and other types of alloys to determine their
efficacy in preventing corrosion and their cost effectiveness. This
study is intended to focus only on metallic alloyed\/clad strands, and
not fiber-reinforced polymer compositions.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected
 Phase I Outcomes:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe objective of this phase is
to identify alternatives to conventional high-strength 7-wire strand
(black strand) for prestressed concrete bridges.&amp;nbsp; The outcome
expected from Phase I is the identification of suitable products which
may meet required mechanical and physical properties for their use in
post-tensioned bridges with regard to overall improved corrosion
resistance and performance, and may be economically
manufactured.\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tExpected Phase II
Outcomes:\n\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tThe Phase 2 study will select one or more
 strand products from Phase I and will perform a detailed evaluation on
large scale stressed concrete bridge members for their constructability
and long term corrosion performance. Phase 2 will result in the
identification of the material\/ products that provide high corrosion
resistance, perform well in the field, and can be economically
manufactured.\n",

        "description": "\n\tType 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the
autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreatic
islets of Langerhans and affects more than one million Americans,
usually with onset in childhood or young adulthood. The disease markedly
 impairs quality of life and shortens lifespan primarily through
premature mortality.&amp;nbsp; T1D is associated with numerous
complications including blindness, renal failure, painful nerve
disorders, and amputation.&amp;nbsp; In addition to its devastating toll
 in human suffering, T1D and its complications result in significant
health care expenditures for families and constitute a major societal
economic burden.\n\n\tClinical Trials have demonstrated significant
reductions in complications of T1D through intensive control of blood
glucose levels. &amp;nbsp;However, despite the availability of
increasingly effective treatment modalities, including insulin
analogues, continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and continuous
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) devices, a substantial proportion
of patients with T1D cannot achieve optimal glycemic control despite
enormous efforts. &amp;nbsp;Compounding this difficulty is the trade-off
 between improved glycemic control and an increased risk for potentially
 life-threatening hypoglycemia.\n\n\tA viable option for the treatment
of diabetes is a system (artificial pancreas or closed-loop) that can
mimic normal pancreatic beta cell function thereby restoring normal
metabolic homeostasis without causing hypoglycemia. &amp;nbsp;However,
there are important technological obstacles such as glucose-sensing
inaccuracies, imperfect algorithms for calculating the appropriate dose
of insulin\/glucagon taking into consideration diet and physical
activity, insulin pumps&amp;rsquo; mechanical problems, time delay from
subcutaneous insulin infusion to pharmacologic effect, biocompatibility
issues and data transmission, inter-device communication deficiencies
that need to be resolved through the development of new technologies
that may lead to integrated\/automated devices. &amp;nbsp;The ultimate
research goal would be the development of mechanical or bio-artificial
systems that may improve metabolic control and decrease glycemic
excursions robustly preventing hypoglycemic episodes.\n\n\tThis FOA is
intended to support cutting edge research conducted by small business
leading to the development of innovative technologies that may advance
progress toward an integrated, long term, automated, wearable, glucose
regulated insulin\/pancreatic hormone delivery closed loop
system.&amp;nbsp; This announcement has two main purposes: a) promote

opportunity announcement (FOA) is to encourage grant applications that
will identify molecular targets for pregnancy associated\/induced
disorders and will lead to the development of new safer and more
effective medications for use in pregnancy. Translational research
methods should be employed.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n\tBackground\n\n\tPregnancy is a period of
significant physiological changes that affect the function of many
biological systems. Changes that occur during pregnancy may cause the
exacerbation\/worsening of pre-existing conditions or the development of
 new ones. Gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertension, preeclampsia and
 premature labor complicate a significant percentage of pregnancies and
remain some of the major causes of maternal and neonatal morbidity and
mortality. Gestational diabetes, for example, complicates 5-12% and
preeclampsia 3-5% of pregnancies.&amp;nbsp; Despite their high
prevalence, drug development for obstetric indications is practically
non-existent. There is almost a complete lack of drug development for
obstetric indications, with only one new class of drug licensed for
obstetric patients in the past 20 years, and no new class of drugs in
clinical trials for primary obstetric applications. Reasons for the
paucity of new drugs for obstetrics include risk aversion, the cost of
reproductive toxicology studies, and perceived small or time-limited
market.\n\n\tIdentification of specific molecular targets associated
with these disorders can lead to the development of new, effective
therapeutics, with a better safety profile, a critical issue in this
vulnerable population.\n\n\tObjectives\n\n\tThe proposed FOA will
support research that aims to identify specific targets that will lead
to the development of new, targeted therapeutics for the prevention
and\/or treatment of pregnancy-related\/induced diseases that are safe
and effective for the mother and developing fetus. Translational
research methods should be employed. An applicant is expected to
assemble and develop the infrastructure, capabilities, research
programs, and teams required to conduct translational research to
accomplish these objectives.\n\n\tResearch areas appropriate for this
announcement include but are not limited to, the
following:\n\n\t\n\t\tAnimal and human trials of already available
therapeutics that target already identified critical&amp;nbsp;molecular
pathways&amp;nbsp; in the maternal and fetal
compartments;\n\t\n\t\tAnimal and human trials of existing experimental
drugs that target already identified critical molecular pathways in the
maternal and fetal compartments;\n\t\n\t\tIdentification of new targets
from already identified critical molecular pathways using high
throughput screening;\n\t\n\t\tDevelopment of novel therapeutics based
on newly identified targets; and\n\t\n\t\tSafety and pharmacokinetic
studies of the above medications.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n",

the development of marine aquaculture in the United States. The U.S. is a
 major consumer of aquaculture products &amp;ndash; we import 91% of our
 seafood and half of that is from aquaculture &amp;ndash; yet we are a
minor producer. Algal products have a huge market worldwide, use energy
from the sun, and can uptake excess nutrients, improving local water
quality. A compelling case can be made for growing algae for specific
compounds, food, feed, fuel and to enhance ecosystem services in the
United States; creating employment and business opportunities and
providing local, safe, and sustainable products. Marine algal
aquaculture is part of NOAA&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive strategy to
maintain healthy and productive marine ecosystems and vibrant coastal
communities. The Department of Commerce and NOAA have produced
complimentary National Aquaculture Policies supporting growth in
domestic aquaculture.\n\n\tProposals are requested for research towards
innovative products and services supporting domestic algal aquaculture.
Priority is given to research that addresses key industry bottlenecks to
 increase economic competitiveness of domestically cultured algae
products, enhance ecosystem services, protect food safety and security,
and create economic opportunities for coastal communities.\n\n\tProject
Goals: New techniques and technologies are needed to support the nascent
 domestic algal aquaculture industry. Projects that would support the
sustainable growth of the industry include but are not limited to: new
engineering technologies (bioreactors, structures, offshore moorings),
production technologies (new candidate species for aquaculture, better
harvest methods, increased yield, physiology, reproduction, genetics and
 genomics), product development, integrated multi-trophic aquaculture
(IMTA), and improved products and tools for preventing, diagnosing, and
controlling disease and contamination from pollutants. Work is also
needed on the raising and refining of algae with nutritional profiles
that can be used to directly enhance human health and\/or provide key
nutrients to aquafeeds.\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected

        "topic_name": "Automated Vertical Reference",
        "description": "\n\tSummary: We are aware of research grade
products yielding millimeter per year motions for dam deformation and
continental drift. Others are able to generate dynamic vertical
positioning on buoys to within 3-5 cm. Between these two ranges we
believe there exist the capability to develop and operationally observe
vertical stability (lack of change) at a sub-centimeter
resolution.\n\n\tA small, easily-deployable Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) based instrument that resolves sub-centimeter vertical and
 horizontal position in earth centered, earth fixed (ECEF) coordinates
has a number of valuable applications. Such a system would be an
as-self-contained-as-possible altimeter and positioning system with
autonomous processing capabilities. It could be collocated and affixed
to existing Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services
(CO-OPS)1 National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON)2 and
land-based sensors to increase temporal identification of vertical site
movement. NWLON water level sensor elevation would be precisely measured
 relative to the GNSS sensor elevation and would provide an additional
frame of reference, independent of the geodetic benchmarks.\n\n\tOther
potential applications include integration with a quick-deployable
land-based water level sensor (i.e. microwave water level) for storm
surge measurements and real-time leveling during extreme events such as
tsunamis at hardened sites. Applications of a more dynamic (non-static)
nature such as deployment on buoys of opportunity in support of modeling
 and water level gauging are also of interest.\n\n\tProject Goals: The
goal is to provide vertical control for a variety of applications. In
addition to monitoring NWLON platform stability over the long-term and
reducing the frequency of required leveling between the water level
sensor and the primary benchmark, this system will add value to the
national network of observing systems and increase spatial coverage of
vertically controlled stations. Implementation of this technology
supports NWLON programmatic goals for precise connections to geodetic
and ellipsoidal reference frames for coastal surveying and engineering
applications.\n\n\tRequirements for this innovative product are that it
be a small, self-contained, automated, and quickly-deployable system
that is cost-effective and consumes minimal power. Kinematic operational
 scenarios range from the &amp;quot;static&amp;quot; to those associated
 with the dynamic water surface. The continuous monitoring of the
sub-centimeter vertical stability of a &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot; water
level sensor platform (microwave or acoustic) as deployed by CO-OPS
represents the normal and satisfactory (nominal) performance
scenario3,4. The nominal system must deliver a horizontal and vertical
position at least once a day when polled by a data collection platform
via RS-232. The device must output the period of observational time and
the vertical uncertainty associated with each position report. An
explicit error code should be output when the device is unable to
deliver sub-centimeter accuracy. The accuracy threshold must be easily
adjustable by the user to accommodate environments where the regularized
 (mean) position solution uncertainty exceeds the sub-centimeter level
due to kinematics.\n\n\tDuring nominal operations, output from the
device will be transmitted along with each six minute microwave or
acoustic water level observation, but the reported vertical position
will be representative of the elevation acquired over whatever period is
 necessary to achieve sub-centimeter precision. Any additional encoding
of the output for integration into the Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite (GOES) transmitted message will be conducted by
CO-OPS and is not a part of this SBIR topic.\n\n\tThrough novel use of
GNSS [GPS, coupled with other systems; e.g., Global Navigation Satellite
 System (GLONASS)] and other sensor technology, the successful vendor
might achieve the Project Goals by: 1) limiting location solutions to
constellations which yield the best vertical dilution of precision, 2)
enabling advanced filtering and statistical techniques over periods as
necessary, 3) starting with the presumption that the receiving antenna
is fixed, 4) employing nearby Continuously Operating Reference Station
(CORS) stations or satellite based corrections, and 5) focusing on
relative position change. Note that even in &amp;quot;static&amp;quot;
conditions, solutions which utilize precise point positioning GNSS
techniques (as opposed to differential GNSS) must not ignore the
sub-daily displacements relative to the ECEF reference frame due to
solid earth tides5. One notion of meeting the goals of being
self-contained and cost-effective is to avoid reliance upon an external
subscription-based augmentation service which involves recurring
fees.\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected Deliverables: A Phase I
result would include, at minimum:\n\t&amp;bull; A description of the
GNSS signal processing that enables the system to provide the required
vertical accuracy\n\t&amp;bull; A demonstration of the system capability
 using real GPS data (not necessarily in real-time or with a field
deployable system)\n\t&amp;bull; A description of the hardware, firmware
 and software that would be developed in a Phase II SBIR\n\n\tPhase II
Activities and Expected Deliverables: A Phase II result would include,
at minimum:\n\t&amp;bull; A mutually acceptable two-way data interface
(polled RS232, National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA)
output)\n\t&amp;bull; Output that includes a measure of position quality
 and sufficient metadata\n\t&amp;bull; Five (5) fully functional
prototypes that would be property of NOAA\/NOS. Field testing should

live fish underwater and (2) fish catch on vessels in order to reduce
labor costs and improve timeliness of data availability. Some of the
technical challenges that must be overcome are variable lighting and
backgrounds and high species diversity. Fish also can be at varying
distances from cameras. The goal is to develop an end-to-end
software\/hardware system that can be used to automate the
identification and sizing of fish in still images.\n\n\tPhase I

allow analyst intervention\/correction in instances where confidence in
species identification is low\n\t&amp;bull; Desired analysis results
include:\n\to Individual fish length measurements and species
identifications\n\to Summary information on species composition and
length distributions collected over multiple image sequences\n\to
Confidence intervals associated with individual species identifications
and length measurements within a sequence and summary statistics for
analysis of multiple sequences.\n\n\tDeliverables:\n\t&amp;bull;
Detailed report on developed technology\/technique under commercial
conditions that provides software package(s)\/platforms and operating

Measurement of Ocean Carbon",
        "description": "\n\tSummary: A full understanding of the ocean
carbon budget is not currently possible due to a lack of seasonal and
geographic coverage of ocean carbon measurements. In order to address
this knowledge gap, there is a pressing need for expanded autonomous, in
 situ, ocean carbon monitoring.\n\n\tOcean carbon instruments that use
non-dispersive infrared gas analyzer (NDIR) technology have a well
proven track record of making quality, long term measurements
(Battelle&amp;#39;s Moored Autonomous partial pressure of C02 (MApC02),
General Oceanic&amp;#39;s pC02, Contros&amp;#39; Hydro C\/C02, Pro
Oceanus&amp;#39; PSI CO2 Pro, etc.). However, the current NDIR sensors
used in these systems are off the shelf products which have been
designed to address a wide range of measurement applications from
industrial to scientific. For example, the NDIR sensor used in the
MApC02 system has a CO2 measurement range of 0-20,000 ppm and has been
optimized to operate at a constant temperature of 50oC (achieved by
heating the NDIR measurement cell). Quantifying the ocean carbon cycle
requires making CO2 measurements with a desired accuracy of +\/- 3 ppm,
using &amp;#39;wet&amp;#39; air [20%-85% relative humidity (RH)] in the
range of 0-2,000 ppm CO2 with instrument temperatures of -10 to
45&amp;deg;C and pressures of 60-120 KPa. Furthermore, long term
autonomous measurement precludes the use of power hungry heaters to
maintain constant NDIR cell temperatures. To maximize instrument
accuracy and minimize thermal noise (without controlling the NDIR
temperature), several autonomous NDIR based oceanographic instruments
calibrate the NDIR cell before every measurement using a two point
calibration routine. While successful, this technique requires bulky
compressed gas cylinders filled with expensive reference
gases.\n\n\tProject Goals: Optimizing a non-dispersive infrared gas
analyzer (NDIR) or developing a comparable CO2 gas measurement
technology for integration into existing and future autonomous CO2 gas
sensor based ocean carbon monitoring instruments with the goals of
decreasing cost, complexity, and power consumption would be very
advantageous to the ocean carbon monitoring community. As the most
expensive component of most ocean carbon monitoring instruments, the
NDIR&amp;#39;s upfront cost hinders the large scale deployment of these
instruments that is needed to fully quantify the ocean carbon cycle.
Additionally, lessening the requirement for calibrating the NDIR before
every measurement would result in smaller instruments for installation
onto to the next generation of autonomous vehicles, decreased observing
network operating costs, and simpler more robust system
designs.\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected
Deliverables:\n\n\t&amp;bull; Kick-off meeting with NOAA to clarify
project requirements and needs.\n\t&amp;bull; Bench testing of potential
 sensor components.\n\t&amp;bull; Design review with NOAA of the
conceptual design including drawings, schematics, bench test results and
 expected instrument accuracy.\n\t&amp;bull; Final report detailing
proposed CO2 gas sensor conceptual design, including specifics on the
detector, and sensor calibration methodology\n\n\t\n\tPhase II
Activities and Expected Deliverables:\n\t&amp;bull; Build a prototype
CO2 gas sensor which has been optimized for the measurement of ocean
carbon.\n\t&amp;bull; Calibrate, and then evaluate the accuracy and
response of the prototype sensor (over a 0-2000ppm CO2 range) to
fluctuations in temperature, pressure, and relative humidity (as stated
in this subtopic&amp;#39;s summary section) in a lab
setting.\n\t&amp;bull; Deliver the prototype instrument, and a brief
report detailing the calibration and lab testing to NOAA.\n\t&amp;bull;
In collaboration with NOAA, field test the prototype sensor in an ocean
environment within an existing CO2 gas sensor based ocean carbon
monitoring system, for a period of at least 1 month.\n",

Gas Stable Isotope Ratios",
        "description": "\n\tSummary: Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)
and methane (CH4) are the dominant contributors to global radiative
forcing, and monitoring their concentrations is vital for understanding
changes in Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate. Interpreting variations of
atmospheric CO2 and CH4 allow sources and sinks of carbon to be
determined. Currently, ultra-high precision laboratory-based
measurements for CO2 and CH4 using isotope ratio mass spectrometers
exist. These devices are labor intensive and require significant
pre-processing of samples. Direct optical methods (i.e. spectroscopy)
have potential to greatly streamline this process if small volumes can
be used and measurements can be made with as good or better precision
and stability than existing mass spectrometric techniques. Instruments
with such high precisions are not currently available in the
marketplace. Instrument developers should aim for measurements of CO2
and CH4 isotope ratios that achieve the needed repeatability
(&amp;delta;13C CO2: 0.01 per mil, &amp;delta;18O CO2: 0.02 per mil,
&amp;delta;13C CH4: 0.1 per mil, or &amp;delta;2H CH4: 0.5 per mil)
using &amp;lt; 600 mL of air [standard temperature and pressure (STP)]
in less than 15 minutes. Note that the requirements pertain to only a
single isotopomer, i.e., a single instrument capable of achieving
precision (repeatability) for multiple isotopomers is a benefit but is
not required.\n\n\tProject Goals: The short-term goal of this project is
 to design a cost-effective and ideally, but not necessarily portable
(adequate for field deployment) ultra-high precision instrument to
measure isotopic composition of greenhouse gases in a way that
significantly improves on the currently slow and labor intensive
techniques while maintaining or exceeding currently achieved
precision.\n\n\tThe long-term goal is performing isotopic measurements
on a routine and large-scale basis for the purpose of attributing
sources of carbon in the atmosphere. Assessing the isotopic composition
of measured greenhouse gases is one of the most accurate techniques to
identify their origin, whether they are emitted by biogenic or
anthropogenic activities (e.g., combustion, fires, biological activity,
air-sea gas exchange).\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected

climate, extreme weather events, and storm risk planning. The
protection, planning, and response to these challenges are central to
NOAA&amp;rsquo;s mission, including disaster planning, mitigation, and
recovery.\n\tBetter preparedness and improved recovery can help save
lives, reduce costs, and provide comfort. Algorithms developed at NOAA
use Weather Surveillance Radar-88 Doppler (WSR-88D) Next-Generation
Radar (NEXRAD) data to detect and track tornados, hail, and mesocyclones
 in real-time. While these data are invaluable for real-time operations,
 historical analysis using other independent data sources is also
essential to planning for storm risk. A compelling need exists to assess
 storm risk by deriving severe weather data products (e.g.
climatologies). This includes trend analysis and risk assessment of
storms (including hurricanes, tornadoes, drought, floods, lightning, and
 hail) and storm reports with damage. Utilities (including tools to
query multiple interoperable databases) are needed to map these
spatially against social and demographic databases to assess populations
 at risk. Access systems need to take advantage of data decoders,
geo-spatial database, and data servers to provide a user friendly and
efficient manner in which to access the data of need. Derived products
based on retrospective data, such as flash flood climatology and other
storm products, need to be stored in a manner that they are directly
accessible and applicable to decision making engagement sites for
planning needs of national, state and local government emergency
response. This project would build on, refine, and expand the functions
of National Climatic Data Centers (NCDCs) current suite of web services:

http:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/cdo-web\/webservices\/ncdcwebservices.\n\n\tProject
 Goals: This project will facilitate the build-out of technical
&amp;ldquo;services&amp;rdquo; such as Application Programming Interface
 (API) services to dynamically discover, harvest and access various
components of NCDC&amp;rsquo;s severe weather database. This will enable
 data-mining of NCDC&amp;rsquo;s severe weather database and provide a
foundation upon which future improvements can be built. The successful
project will build a more accessible &amp;ldquo;platform&amp;rdquo; of
services to be leveraged by the larger community of developers and
firms.\n\n\tThis approach for deriving storm risk assessment products
can be leveraged by other hazardous weather software toolkits. For
example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a tool named
 Hazards United States &amp;ndash; Multi Hazard (HAZUS-MH) which is a
risk assessment tool that analyzes potential losses from floods,
hurricane winds, and earthquakes. While HAZUS is a modeling and mapping
tool for risk assessment, the proposed Geospatial Database for Storm
Risk Assessment is a data management system for severe weather data that
 creates storm risk assessment products. These products could be
integrated into HAZUS via standards-based web services. This allows
HAZUS to easily integrate new datasets and models without worrying about
 the data management (formats, projections, etc.). Other private sector
companies that support themes such as risk management (insurance and
reinsurance) will be able to use the storm risk geospatial database to
easily access information and climatological products mined from
petabytes of archived data. Many of these datasets are currently not
used due to the size and complexity of the raw data. Standards-based web
 services will allow the seamless integration of the database into
custom applications developed by these companies.\n\n\tPhase I

NCDC&amp;rsquo;s various historical databases\n\t&amp;bull; Coordinate

oceans spans such different factors ranging from hurricane forecasts to
determination of hypoxia zones to assessment of fisheries stocks. There
is a current need for improving the quality of forecasting changes of
hurricane intensity and to develop affordable sensors of dissolved
oxygen for the determination of the extent of hypoxia zones. Some of the
 factors influencing the changes in hurricane intensity include
temperature at different layers below the ocean&amp;#39;s surface and
mixing of the thermal layers because of surface-wind-induced turbulence.
 There are currently no inexpensive observing systems that detect
temperature, salinity, and currents under the ocean&amp;#39;s surface.
This SBIR project seeks to sponsor the development of a dropsonde that
will have the ability to provide the subsurface variables already
mentioned and optionally atmospheric variables such as temperature,
relative humidity, wind speed, and direction.\n\n\tHypoxia zones cause a
 considerable impact to affected fisheries and it is important to know
the extent of those zones at different depths in order to forecast their
 location as a function of winds and currents and their impact on
fisheries stocks. Airborne submersible dropsondes would allow a
considerable area of ocean to be covered in a reasonable amount of time
compared to what it would take to do sensor deployment from a surface
vessel.\n\n\tThose requirements point at a need for a modular
multi-purpose dropsonde that can be field customized for temperature,
salinity, and current observations and optionally dissolved oxygen
observations.\n\n\tProject Goals: This SBIR seeks to sponsor the
development of a dropsonde that can be used for two purposes: 1) ocean
properties for ocean, weather, and climate forecasts and 2) is capable
of surviving the drop from an aircraft, descend to at least 200 m depth
below the sea surface, and re-surface at least once. While underwater,
collect at every 1 m depth and store observations of water temperature,
salinity, and translational and rotational accelerations in the X, Y and
 Z axis. The sonde will be required to surface at least once after
submerging but additional points in the evaluation of proposals will be
given to those proposed designs for sondes that can dive to 200 m and
resurface more than once. Preferably, the sonde will have dimensions
compatible with the current generation of dropsonde systems. Designs
that are not compatible will need to include the costs of retooling the
dropsonde systems in the NOAA, Air Force, and Navy aircraft as part of
the overall project cost estimate. The overall system will include means
 and procedures to calibrate the sensors before deployment.\n\n\t\n\tThe
 sonde will include the following systems:\n\n\t1) GPS for surface
position determination\n\t2) Communications link\n\t3) Underwater
pressure transducer capable for depths of at least 200 m.\n\t4) Salinity
 sensor\n\t5) Temperature sensor\n\t6) Dissolved Oxygen sensor\n\t7)
Solid State Inertial Management Unit (IMU) either available
commercial-off-the-shelf, or manufactured from individual components.
The IMU must be capable of determining translational and rotational
accelerations in the X, Y and Z axis (6 axis), and optionally three (3)
magnetic axis\n\t8) Buoyancy control\n\t9) Data collection and storage
subsystem. Environmental data collected every 1 m depth. Acceleration
data collected every 0.1 sec.\n\t10) Position processing subsystem.
Preferably done on-board on real-time but an off-board solution is
acceptable.\n\t11) Power storage and management subsystem capable of

Weather Service for real time warnings and forecasts of severe weather,
any time of the year and any location across the nation, to include the
48 contiguous states, Alaska, Hawaii and its territories. The satellite
imagery on the main NWS link shows very little useful information for
customers, is not actionable, and actually confuses those who look at
it. With the amount of detailed and accurate satellite information
collected and the advent of geo-referencing and imagery demarcation
technology this should not be occurring. With innovation and hard work,
NWS will have the premier path for portraying critical weather warnings
with real-time, concise satellite imagery, both from geosynchronous and
polar orbiting platforms.\n\n\tThe current portrayal of satellite
imagery on NWS web pages is too science-oriented and lacks localization
needed to fully illustrate potential weather impacts. Furthermore, this
web service does not exploit the depth of information content available
today and if not upgraded will be woefully inadequate when the GOES-R
and JPSS programs are fully implemented and available. For example,
there is no capability to regionalize cloud imagery to selected areas of
 interest, understand or refine cloud color enhancements, relate
satellite imagery to immediate weather danger, or relate satellite
imagery to radar imagery and surface observations. NWS needs help in
taking full advantage of what satellite channels can convey in terms of
weather hazards, in centralizing all satellite products and loops onto
one known link that customers can easily recognize, and use GIS features
 to show relationship of cloud and surface details (shown by channels)
to certain geographic and political features.\n\n\tThe proposed
technology will take one or more of these factors into consideration to
demonstrate a capability that will capture all available METSAT imagery
from NOAA in a way that customers can use it readily for their daily
lives. This includes being able to look at regional depiction of foggy
areas for the Northeast, Department of Agriculture finding exactly where
 snow is still on the ground over the Plains, the ability for an
incident commander to focus in on small thunderstorms in the mountains
or remote areas, and a mother trying to find where snow showers are in
absence of radar imagery; there are so many features that satellite
imagery can provide for customers that would fulfill a Weather Ready

Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Sensing",
        "description": "\n\tSummary: Weather observations of atmospheric
 temperature, pressure, moisture, wind speed and wind direction in the
atmospheric boundary layer are extremely important for a better
understanding of how the detailed interactions of the atmosphere and the
 ocean influence the development of high impact weather events such as
hurricanes and other storms at sea. Improving this understanding of
air-sea interactions and potentially providing real-time operational
boundary layer weather observations could be highly significant
contributions to supporting improved storm prediction. However,
collecting these types of boundary layer observations are extremely
difficult due to the lack of spatial resolution of satellite
observations at storm scales or the danger of manned aircraft flights in
 the low boundary layer.\n\n\tThe commercial development of aircraft
dropsondes for weather observations is an example of how vertical
atmospheric profiles have become well-calibrated industry standards for
the Federal, academic, and private industry weather communities. New
innovations in unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are providing a variety
of options for flights into the boundary layer using low-flying UAS
launched from land, ships, balloons, or other aircraft. However, an
integrated, well-calibrated, versatile plug-and-play payload sensor
package for boundary layer weather or sea surface temperature (SST)
observations has not been developed for UAS applications. Additionally,
commercial dropsondes do not currently provide reliable SST observations
 for air-sea interaction studies.\n\n\tThe NOAA UAS Program is
partnering with the ESRL Physical Sciences Division and the AOML
Hurricane Research Division to explore the technical feasibility of an
integrated, well-calibrated, versatile plug-and-play payload sensor
package for improved boundary layer weather and SST observations from
UAS and dropsondes.\n\n\tProject Goals: The Tropical Cyclone Boundary
Layer (TCBL) is the most poorly observed aspect of tropical cyclones,
and will be used as the basis of the observation requirement although
previously mentioned hazardous weather events have similar requirements.
 High winds, heavy rain, sea spray, and high ocean waves cause
significant problems for observations near the sea surface. These
factors make observations of the TCBL very dangerous., The TCBL receives
 much attention due to its importance in the intensification of tropical
 cyclones. The TCBL is characterized by strong turbulence. Both
low-level wind shear and buoyancy lead to sometimes-violent vertical
mixing, distributing characteristics throughout the layer. It is in the
TCBL that fluxes of heat, moisture, and momentum occurs, providing the
energy and moisture necessary to maintain a storm&amp;#39;s intensity.
These missions pose a safety challenge platform, instruments and
operators in this area of interest.\n\n\tThe NOAA UAS Program exploring
cost and operationally feasible unmanned observing strategies for
hazardous weather collection. We request a Phase I study to demonstrate
the design feasibility of an airborne atmospheric and Sea Surface
Temperature (SST) sensing suitable for autonomous data collection with
dropsondes and onboard a low altitude UAS operating in turbulent
environments. The design of the system must describe the detailed system
 interface including sensor, power, navigation, and data communication
systems.\n\n\tPhase I Activities and Expected Deliverables: The purpose
of this Phase I is to determine the technical feasibility of the
proposed research and the quality of performance of the small business
concern receiving an award. We request a Phase I study to demonstrate
the design feasibility of airborne atmospheric and SST suitable for
autonomous data collection onboard dropsondes and low altitude UAS
operating in hazardous environments. The design of the system
must:\n\n\t1. Identify dropsondes and feasible UAS platforms,\n\t2.
Identify a payload suitable for atmospheric (wind vector, pressure,
temperature, humidity, latent and sensible heat flux) and SST data
collection,\n\t3. Describe the detailed system interface between the
platform and payload,\n\t4. Describe the power, navigation, and data
communication sub-systems,\n\t5. Provide a cost analysis for Phase II
and future operational system.\n\n\tPhase II Activities and Expected
Deliverables: Phase II will be the Research &amp;amp; Development
(R&amp;amp;D) and prototype development phase which will
require:\n\n\t1. Comprehensive proposal outlining the research in
detail,\n\t2. New technology flight demonstration of proposed dropsonde
and UAS system (small business may request government owned equipment in
 this phase),\n\t3. Delivery of the prototype design including
drawings,\n\t4. Plan to commercialize the final product,\n\t5. A company
 presentation to the SBIR panel.\n\n\tKey Driving Requirements for TCBL

Center(s):DFRC,GRC\n\nNASA is concerned with the prevention of
encounters with hazardous in-flight conditions and the mitigation of
their effects when they do occur. Hazardous flight conditions of
particular interest are: wake vortices, clear-air turbulence, in-flight
icing, lightning, and low visibility. NASA is interested in new and
innovative methods for detection, identification, evaluation, and
monitoring of in-flight hazards to aviation. In the case of lightning,
interest is centered on the mitigation and in-flight measurement of
lightning damage, particularly to composite aircraft.\n\n\n\nNASA seeks
to foster research and development that leads to innovative new
technologies and methods, or significant improvements in existing
technologies, for in-flight hazard avoidance and mitigation.
Technologies may take the form of tools, models, techniques, procedures,
 substantiated guidelines, prototypes, and devices. Proposed products
may be for retrofit into current aircraft or for installation in future
aircraft. Both manned and unmanned aircraft are of interest.\n\n\n\nA
key objective of the NASA Aviation Safety Program is to support the
research of technology, systems, and methods that will facilitate
transformation of the National Airspace System to Next Generation Air
Transportation System (NextGen). Additional information is available at
(http:\/\/www.jpdo.gov). The general approach to the development of
airborne sensors for NextGen is to encourage the development of
multi-use, adaptable, and effective sensors that will have a strong
benefit to safety. The greatest impact will result from improved sensing
 capability in the terminal area, where higher density and more reliable
 operations are required for NextGen.\n\n\n\nUnder this subtopic,
proposals are invited that explore new and improved sensors and sensor
systems for the detection and monitoring of hazards to aircraft before
they are encountered. Approaches that use multiple sensors in
combination to improve hazard detection and quantification of hazard
levels are also of interest. With regard to hazardous lightning
conditions, the emphasis is not on remote detection, but rather on
developing systems that make aircraft more robust in a lightning
environment or provide in-flight damage assessment or other hazard
mitigating benefits. The design and development of composite materials
and composite construction methods are not included in this subtopic.
The scope of this subtopic does not include human factors and focused
development of human interfaces, including displays and alerts. Primary
emphasis is on airborne applications, but in some cases the development
of ground-based sensor technology may be supported.\n\n\n\nAreas of
particular interest to NASA at this time are described in more detail
below. The list and details are provided as encouragement but are not
intended to exclude other proposals that fit the scope of this
subtopic.\n\n\n\nLightning\n\n\n\nLightning Strike Protection - NASA is
investigating means for mitigating damage to aircraft, with a particular
 interest in protecting composite aircraft. Currently, an
electrically-conductive screen protects composite aircraft by
functioning as a Faraday shield and is intended to confine lightning and
 electromagnetic effects to the outside or outermost skin of the
aircraft. The lightning strike protection system, hereafter referred to
as the LSP, is incorporated in the coatings, layers, and structure that
comprise the skin of the aircraft. NASA is most interested in LSP
solutions that will be cost effective and light-weight. The design and
development of composite materials and construction methods is out of
scope for this subtopic.\n\nMitigation of Lightning Strike Damage - NASA
 is seeking solutions that will provide better protection from lightning
 damage by directing attachment points or lightning currents to safe or
less hazardous areas and by reducing the susceptibility of the aircraft
to thermal or other damage due to strikes.\n\nIn-flight Lightning Damage
 Measurement and Assessment - A typical commercial aircraft is struck by
 lightning about once per year. At this time, composite aircraft that
are struck in-flight are inspected upon landing for a damage assessment.
 Such assessments may be time-consuming and difficult. Innovations that
will provide a measurement or damage detection system in the LSP are
solicited. The objective would be to achieve a capability to have damage
 detection and assessment in the aircraft that will provide immediate
information to the flight crew after a lightning
attachment.\n\n\n\nPolarimetric Radar Technology\n\n\n\nPolarimetric
Antennas - Recent investigations indicate that polarimetric capability
would provide a substantial advancement in airborne weather radar. Flat
plate, slot antenna (single polarity) arrays currently in use are
cost-effective, light-weight, and rugged. An innovative polarimetric
antenna design that meets the same criteria would be a major step toward
 implementation of polarimetric radar. Existing commercial aircraft
dictate the antenna system requirements, and new antenna designs should
be suitable for retrofit. Innovative techniques, designs, or
developments that lead to polarimetric antennas that are affordable and
effective and can be retrofit to existing commercial aircraft are
solicited.\n\n\n\nTurbulence and Wake Vortex\n\n\n\nRemote Detection of
Kinetic Air Hazards - The class of hazards including wake vortices,
turbulence, and other hazards associated with air motion is referred to
as kinetic air hazards. Within this class, wakes and turbulence are the
highest priorities; however, NASA is particularly interested in sensor
systems that can detect multiple hazards and thus provide greater
utility. For example, air data systems are at times disabled by icing,
and a multi-function, multi-hazard sensor that includes a robust
alternative air data source would be a great asset in such
conditions.\n\nAirborne Detection of Wake Vortices - Airborne detection
of wake vortices is considered challenging due to the fact that
detection must be possible in nearly all weather conditions, in order to
 be practical, and because of the size and nature of the phenomena. In
particular, NASA is interested in the ability to detect and measure wake
 vortex hazards for arbitrary viewing angles.\n\nAirborne Detection of
Turbulence - NASA has made a major investment in the development of new
and enhanced technologies to enable detection of turbulence to improve
aviation safety. Progress has been made in efforts to quantify hazard
levels from convectively induced turbulence events and to make these
quantitative assessments available to civil and commercial aviation.
NASA is interested in expanding these prior efforts to take advantage of
 the newly developing turbulence monitoring technologies, particularly
those focused on clear air turbulence (CAT). NASA welcomes proposals
that explore the methods, algorithms and quantitative assessment of
turbulence for the purpose of increasing aviation safety and augmenting
currently available data in support of NextGen operations.",

ultimately to the level of the national airspace. For this topic, we are

interaction. We expect to gain knowledge on latent deficiencies in crew

 being in an aircraft.\n\n\n\nThere exist few, if any, regulations
specifically addressing UAS today. The primary user of UAS to date has
been the military. The technologies and procedures to enable seamless
operation and integration of UAS in the NAS need to be developed,
validated, and employed by the FAA through rule making and policy
development.\n\n\n\nThe Project goal is to provide research findings to
reduce technical barriers associated with integrating UAS into the NAS
utilizing integrated system level tests in a relevant environment. The
project is currently broken down into five subprojects:
\n\n\n\nSeparation Assurance\/Sense and Avoid Interoperability (SSI)
\n\nCommunications\n\nHuman Systems Integration \n\nCertification
\n\nIntegrated Test and Evaluation\n\n\n\nThe fifth subproject,
Integrated Test and Evaluation, is responsible for developing a live,
virtual, and constructive test environment for the other four
subprojects. During the first phase, (May-2011 to September-2013) the
project has: \n\n\n\nConducted initial modeling, simulation, and flight
testing. \n\nCompleted early subproject-focused deliverables (spectrum
requirements, comparative analysis of certification methodologies,
etc.). \n\nValidated the key technical elements identified by the
project. \n\n\n\nThe plan for the second phase includes the following:
\n\n\n\nConduct systems-level, integrated testing of concepts and\/or
capabilities that address barriers to routine access to the NAS.
\n\nDevelop a body of evidence (including validated data, algorithms,
analysis, and recommendations) to support key decision makers in
establishing policy, procedures, standards and regulations, enabling
routine UAS access in the NAS. \n\n\n\nThis solicitation seeks
proposals, but is not limited, to develop concepts that can reduce the
technical barriers related to the safety and operational challenges of
routine UAS operations in the NAS.\n\n\n\nCertified Control and
Non-Payload Communications (CNPC) system - Current civil UAS operations
are significantly constrained by the lack of a standardized, certified
control and non-payload communications (CNPC) system. The UAS CNPC
system is to provide communications functions between the Unmanned
Aircraft (UA) and the UA ground control station for such applications
as: telecommands; non-payload telemetry; navigation aid data; air
traffic control (ATC) voice relay; air traffic services (ATS) data
relay; sense and avoid data relay; airborne weather radar data; and
non-payload situational awareness video. New and innovative approaches
to providing terrestrial and space-based high-bandwidth CNPC systems
that are inexpensive, small, low latency, reliable, and secure offer
opportunities for quantum jumps in UAS utility and capabilities. Of
particular interest are:\n\nTechnologies for High power C-band
amplifiers and highly linear C-band power amplifiers\/linearization of
high power C-band amplifiers.\n\nMiniaturization of C-band terrestrial
radio components\/systems and C- Ku- and Ka-Band satellite
communications components\/systems.\n\nConformal steerable antennas for
satellite communications links in C-, Ku- and Ka Band.\n\nWeather
Information Systems for GCS - On-board, real-time graphic aviation
weather information products have been developed and successfully
implemented for manned cockpits. Their use is now widespread and their
safety impact widely recognized. The applicability of such products for
operators and ground control pilots to enhance situation awareness and
improve mission planning and execution is of interest to NASA. Systems
such as the NASA developed Aviation Weather Information (AWIN) system
that included software, data and data-link applications, color weather
graphics such as composite-radar mosaic, lightning-strike data, wind
data, satellite images and forecasts could be integrated into a ground
control station to provide pilots with weather awareness before and
during mission execution. Improved weather awareness should allow
aircrews to avoid most weather-related problems through both pre-flight
and en-route planning. While the use of these systems has been explored
for military UAS operations, their applicability to civil and public
operations has not yet been explored.\n\nSafety Analysis and
Methodologies - UAS operations are untried in the civil NAS. Unlike
other aircraft, there is not an extensive record of civil operations
upon which to forecast the safety of UAS operations in the NAS. The
introduction of UAS into the NAS raises many safety issues and concerns.
 Typically, anytime a new capability is added into the NAS, an
Operational Safety Assessment (OSA) is performed by the FAA, to
determine whether that introduction of new capability will enhance or
detract from the safety of the NAS. As these UAS represent a wholly new
operational system, traditional approaches cannot suffice. Research is
needed to identify and develop new safety analysis approaches, as well
as prognostic indicators and potential new safety metrics.\n\nAutonomous
 Operations - As vehicle capabilities and machine intelligence continue
to evolve, it is expected that future air vehicles, especially unmanned
vehicles, will assume an increasing level of independent
decision-making, flight monitoring and management, and trajectory
management. As the Next-Generation Air Traffic Management System
(NextGen) continues to evolve and expand, the future system will need to
 concurrently develop operational accommodations for these aircraft that
 manifest increasing levels of autonomy. Thus, autonomous vehicles and
NextGen must evolve in complementary ways to accommodate these future
operational considerations. At a minimum, future autonomous systems must
 demonstrate successfully the following
characteristics:\n\nCollision\/hazard avoidance.\n\nAutonomous
navigation under uncertain conditions.\n\nCooperative task completion
(if more than one aircraft is needed for a particular
operation).\n\nRecognition of anomalies.\n\nLong term system
diagnostics, failure prediction and correction.\n\nDevelopment of a UAS
Flight Inspection and Cargo Aircraft Capability Concept - Currently the
FAA conducts flight inspections of the ground based air navigational
aids and guidance systems (MLS, TACAN, VASI) in Antarctica using a
CL-601 Challenger corporate executive jet type of aircraft, not
certified for operations from ice and gravel runways. The risk for
damage to these costly aircraft is high and no flights are made to
remote areas, like Antarctica, without the inclusion of maintenance
personnel among the crew. A UAS, RPV equipped for flight inspection work
 in Antarctica and other remote areas utilizing a simple rugged STOL
type of vehicle, ski or wheel equipped, (thus capable of operating from
rough snow, ice and short gravel runways) would greatly reduce the risks
 and costs of flight inspecting and light air logistics in Antarctica.
The environment in Antarctica is a perfect venue to demonstrate an
efficient, practical and environmental friendly use of unmanned aircraft
 technologies to a worldwide audience. Basic requirements for a drone
utilized in this type of operation include:\n\nAbility to carry a
1000-pound payload 800 nautical miles and return with no need for
additional fuel.\n\nBe TCAS responsive and "visible" to other
traffic.\n\nBe equipped with bubble observation windows and mounts for
various surveillance and photography systems.\n\nHave the capability to
operate from the short gravel runways.",

amounts of gaseous and particulate emissions to satisfy increasingly
stringent emissions regulations. Future vehicles will be more
fuel-efficient which will result in smaller engine cores operating at

Center(s):GRC\n\nNASA continues to investigate the potential of
advanced, innovative propulsion and aircraft concepts to improve fuel
efficiency and reduce the environmental footprint of future generations
of commercial transports across the subsonic and supersonic flight
regimes. Conceptual design and analysis of unconventional vehicle
concepts and technologies is used for technology portfolio investment
planning, development of advanced concepts to provide technology pull,
and independent technical assessment of new concepts. The agency's
systems analysts need to have the best conceptual design\/analysis tools
 possible to support these efforts. Substantial progress has been
recently made in incorporating more physics-based analysis tools in the
conceptual design process and NASA has developed a capability that
integrates several analysis tools and models in engineering frameworks,
such as ModelCenter and OpenMDAO. The current focus is instead on
filling remaining capability gaps in specific design disciplines. As
such, the purpose of this subtopic is to solicit proposals for
innovative solutions which address the problem of rapidly obtaining
reasonably accurate airframe weight and center of gravity estimates
during the conceptual design of unconventional
configurations.\n\n\n\nHistorically, empirical and semi-empirical weight
 estimation methods have been utilized during the conceptual design
phase. These methods work well for the conceptual design of conventional
 vehicles with parameters that reside within the historical databases
used to develop the methodologies. These methods are not well suited,
however, for unconventional vehicle concepts, or even conventional
concepts which reside outside of the database (for example, very high
aspect ratio swept wings). Developing higher order, more accurate tools
suitable for conceptual design is a difficult challenge. The first issue
 is analysis turnaround time. To perform the configuration trades and
optimization typical of conceptual design, runtimes measured in seconds
or minutes, instead of hours or days, are required. However, rapid
analysis turnaround time alone is insufficient. To be suitable for
conceptual design, tools and methods are needed which accurately predict
 the "as-built" characteristics. Because it is not possible to model
every detail of the design and account for all the underlying physics in
 the problem formulation, it is difficult to predict the "as-built"
characteristics with physics-based methods alone. What is usually
required is a combination of these methods with some semi-empirical
corrections. A final challenge in conceptual design is a lack of
detailed design information. Lower order, empirical-based methods often
require only gross design parameters as inputs. High-order,
physics-based methods currently require detailed design knowledge to be
useful. For example, whereas semi-empirical weight prediction tools
provide estimates for wing weight without needing a structural layout,
such detail is necessary to successfully utilize finite-element analysis
 tools. This gap between the analysis capability and the maturity of the
 design being analyzed currently limits the usefulness of high order
analysis in conceptual design. Physics-based tools for conceptual design
 are needed which are consistent with the amount of design knowledge
that is available at the conceptual design stage.\n\n\n\nSpecifically
for FY 2014, desired capabilities include the following:\n\n\n\nNew
weight estimation relationships valid for wing and\/or fuselage
geometries outside of current historical databases.\n\nIncreased

Measurements topic supports the experimental modeling and simulation
requirements of NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate from
takeoff speeds to Mach 10, as well as the testing requirements of other
government and commercial entities. The primary objective is to develop
innovative tools and technologies that enhance measurement capabilities,
 improve ground and flight resource utilization, and provide capability
sustainment. This year the primary emphasis is on ground testing
requirements.\n\n\n\nWind tunnel vehicle design databases have
traditionally included the foundational measurements of forces, discrete
 surface pressures, and discrete surface temperatures. However,
designing and testing future vehicles with highly integrated and
possibly distributed propulsion and flow control systems will require
enhanced, remotely sensed global surface measurements to accurately
define the vehicle performance and acoustic levels covering a wide range
 of operational conditions. Enhanced optical systems are required to
visualize the flow interactions both on and off the surface.
Non-intrusive measurement systems offering multi-component velocities,
density, and pressure in the tunnel stream are required to routinely
quantify and baseline the test environment and to establish boundary
conditions for advanced computational simulations. Non-intrusive
measurements of off-body and near-body flow parameters both at a point
and globally (i.e., planar or volumetric) are necessary to examine
fluid-fluid and fluid-structure interactions for computational solution
validation. In all cases, significant measurement accuracy enhancements
are required to achieve the revolutionary aircraft systems of the
future. Measurement systems must be robust and user-friendly to achieve
the level of utility required for practical and routine application.
Clean seeding methods that do not contaminate anti-turbulence screens
are required in the wind tunnel testing environment; seedless methods
for velocity measurements are particularly desired. Compact measurement
systems and analysis techniques with dual use capability in both ground
and flight test environments are valuable, enabling smooth transition
between each. Since wind tunnel test data must ultimately represent
free-air conditions, techniques and\/or analysis methods that can
demonstrate and articulate novel ground to flight extrapolation
methodologies are sought. In all cases, measurement methods that can
significantly increase data capture per test point are desired,
including the simultaneous measurement of multiple flow parameters.
Accordingly, the topic solicits cutting-edge enhancements that
significantly improve existing test and measurement capabilities, and
enabling tools that provide new opportunities for aerodynamic and
aerothermodynamic discovery for NextGen and high-speed transportation
systems.\n\n\n\nThe contraction of the Nation's ground-based testing
resources emphasizes the technological need to improve wind tunnel
utilization. Advanced methods that aid pre-test planning, improve data
collection, enhance visual display in a data rich environment, and
provide rapid analysis are solicited.\n\n\n\nWith an aging and reduced
workforce comes the challenge of capability sustainment. Tools and
technologies are solicited that enable knowledge capture, offer
ubiquitous training, and provide workforce agility.",

involves collecting and converting local resources into products that
can reduce mission mass, cost, and\/or risk of human exploration. ISRU
products that provide significant mission benefits with minimal
infrastructure required are propellants, fuel cell reactants, and life
support consumable. Innovative technologies and approaches are sought
related to ISRU processes associated with collecting, separating,
pressurizing, and processing gases collected from in-situ resources
including the Mars atmosphere, trash processing, and volatiles released
from in-situ soil\/regolith resources, into oxygen, methane, and water.
State of the art (SOA) technologies for these ISRU processes either do
not exist or are too complex, heavy, inefficient, or consume too much
power. The innovative technologies and process sought must operate in
low and micro-gravity environments, must be scalable from low
demonstration processing and production flow rates of 0.045 kg\/hr of
carbon dioxide (CO2) and 0.015 kg\/hr of oxygen (O2) to utilization flow
 rates of 2.25 kg\/hr for CO2 and 0.75 kg\/hr for O2. Chemical

 is: scalable, has minimum pressure drop, can operate at low inlet
pressures, and provides 99% @ 0.3 um collection efficiency, with &gt;95%
 regeneration capability for multiple cleaning cycles. SOA filters are
replaced by the crew or sized for the complete mission. Since Mars ISRU
operations will occur without a crew present and between 100 and 480
days in duration, cleaning and regeneration of filtration approaches is
required.\n\nDust\/particle measurement device that allows for size and
particle density measurements before and after filtration. Optional
additional capabilities including electrostatic and or mineral
characterization are also of interest. Dust measurement devices must
integrate into limited volume areas and interface with
atmosphere-inlets\/trash processing outlet tubing.\n\nLightweight,
low-power device to deliver fresh Mars 'air' (0.1 psia) to the plant
with small head pressure capability (10's torr). SOA blowers currently
do not exist which can effectively move the low pressure Mars atmosphere
 efficiently (power and mass) for long-periods of time. Thermal
management and\/or use must be clearly defined for proposed
devices.\n\nLightweight, lower power device to collect and pressurize
CO2 from 0.1 psia to &gt;15 psia; maximum 75 psia. SOA mechanical
compressors are heavy, power intensive, and have limited life. Mars
atmosphere CO2 collection devices will need to operate for a minimum of
100 days and up to 480 days. Thermal management and\/or use must be
clearly defined for proposed devices.\n\nHigh throughput water
separation from gas streams. SOA devices utilize water tanks and
chillers which are potentially large, heavy, and power intensive. Highly
 efficient, low power, and compact membrane and adsorption based
separation devices allowing for very low dew point exhaust are
sought.\n\nHigh throughput carbon monoxide\/carbon dioxide separation
and recycling concepts for processes with only partial conversion of CO2
 into usable products. Highly efficient, low power, and compact membrane
 and adsorption based separation devices are sought with minimum
pressure drop.\n\nHighly efficient chemical reactors and heat exchangers
 based on modular\/stackable microchannel plate architectures. SOA
catalyst bed type reactors are inefficient in mass and volume and are
not easily scalable to higher processing rates without reactor bed
redesigns and thermal management changes. Thermal management and\/or use
 must be clearly defined for proposed devices.\n\n\n\nProposals must
identify and provide clear benefits compared to state of the art
technologies and processes in the areas of mass, volume, and\/or power
reduction as well as define the expected impact of changing gravity
orientation and strength. SOA for most processing technologies are
terrestrial applications or space life support systems. Phase I
proposals for innovative technologies and processes must include the
design and test of critical attributes or high risk areas associated
with the proposed technology or process. Phase II proposals must further
 Phase I efforts leading to the design, build, test, and delivery of
hardware (at rates specified above) that can be integrated into

concepts to support the development of recycling\/reclaiming
technologies for Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastic parts in
space, thus providing viable solutions for self-sustained additive
manufacturing capability with plastic materials.\n\n\n\nAs the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) destinations push farther
beyond the limits of low Earth orbit, the convenience of fabricating
components and equipment on the ground to quickly resupply missions will
 no longer be a reasonable option. Resupply is difficult during deep
space missions; it requires a paradigm shift in the way the Agency
currently relies on an Earth-based supply chain for spares, maintenance,
 repair, and hardware design models, including those currently on the
International Space Station (ISS). With the ISS program extension, there
 is a high likelihood of necessary replacement parts. This is a unique
opportunity to begin changing the current model for resupply and repair
to prepare and mature technology for deep space exploration
missions.\n\n\n\n3-D printing, formally known as "Additive
Manufacturing", is the method of building parts layer-by-layer from data
 files such as Computer Aided Design models. Data files with tool and
part schematics can be pre-loaded onto the device before a launch, or
up-linked to the device while on-orbit. 3-D printers currently scheduled
 for on-board ISS use will employ extrusion-based additive
manufacturing, which involves building an object out of plastic
deposited by the melting of feedstock by an extruder head. The plastic
extrusion additive manufacturing process is a low-energy, low-mass
solution to many common needs on board the ISS.\n\n\n\nThe 3-D Printing
in Zero-G "3-D Print" Technology Demonstration and the Additive
Manufacturing Facility (AMF) plan to utilize the commercial 3-D printing
 standard 1.75mm ABS filament as feedstock on ISS. To truly develop a
self-sustaining, closed-loop on-orbit manufacturing process that will
result in less mass to launch and increased on-demand capability in
space, a means of recycling and reclaiming the feedstock is required.
This SBIR seeks technologies that can take ABS parts analogous to those
which could be printed on ISS (maximum size of 6cm x 12 cm x 6 cm) and
demonstrate recycling\/reclamation capability of the part back into
1.75mm filament feedstock.\n\n\n\nThis subtopic seeks innovative
technologies in the following areas:\n\n\n\nABS part reclamation -
decomposing a plastic part (maximum size of 6 cm x 12 cm x 6 cm) and
reconstitution into 1.75mm (\ufffd0.1mm) diameter wire spools, pellets,
or other forms that can be fed into an extrusion device.\n\nProduction
of recycled plastic filament while maintaining repeatable, consistent
filament diameter of 1.75mm with \ufffd0.1mm tolerance.\n\nMethods to
avoid bulging of feedstock as the filament is
created.\n\nGravity-independent filament spooling capability: drawing
the filament onto a feedstock spool as it is being created without
relying on gravity to guide the filament. Goal for spool dimension
should be 156mm OD, 48mm ID, 43mm wide.\n\nEnvironmental containment for
 Foreign Object Debris (FOD) and material off-gassing.\n\n\n\nFor all
above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate
technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II
hardware\/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit
for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.
Demonstration of the Engineering Unit at the end of Phase II may lead to
 an opportunity for a Phase III contract for a Flight Unit.\n\n\n\nPhase

technology should be suitable for hand-held portable use. Battery
powered wireless operation is desirable. Specific issues to be addressed
 include: pitting from micrometeoroid impacts, stress fractures, leaking
 of cooling gases and liquids and detection of abnormal hot spots in
power electronics and circuit boards.\n\n\n\nFor the above, research

hardware development during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II

        "description": "The SBIR Topic area of Radiation Protection
focuses on the development and testing of mitigation concepts to protect
 astronaut crews and exploration vehicles from the harmful effects of
space radiation, both in low Earth orbit (LEO) and while conducting long
 duration missions beyond LEO. All space radiation environments in which
 humans may travel in the foreseeable future are considered, including
geosynchronous orbit, Moon, Mars, and the Asteroids. Advances are needed
 in mitigation schema for the next generation of exploration vehicles
inclusive of radiation shielding systems and structures technologies to
protect humans from the hazards of space radiation during NASA missions.
 As NASA continues to form plans for long duration exploration, it has
also become clear that the ability to mitigate the risks posed to both
crews and vehicle systems by the space weather environment is also of
central importance. Advances in radiation shielding systems technologies
 are needed to protect humans from all threats of space radiation. All
particulate radiations are considered, including electrons, protons,
neutrons, alpha particles, light ions, and heavy ions. This topic is
particularly interested in mid-TRL (technology readiness level)
technologies. Lightweight radiation shielding materials are needed to
shield humans in aerospace transportation vehicles, large space
structures, space stations, orbiters, landers, rovers, habitats, and
spacesuits. The materials emphasis should be on non-parasitic radiation
shielding materials, or multifunctional materials, where two of the
functions are structural and radiation shielding. Non-materials
solutions, such as utilizing food, water, and waste already on board as
radiation shielding are also sought. A challenge of particular interest
is to contain and use human waste as radiation shielding. Advanced
computer codes are needed to model and predict the transport of
radiation through materials and subsystems, as well as to predict the
effects of radiation on the physiological performance, health, and
well-being of humans in space radiation environments. Laboratory and
spaceflight data are needed to validate the accuracy of radiation
transport codes, as well as to validate the effectiveness of
multifunctional radiation shielding materials and subsystems. Also of
interest are comprehensive radiation shielding databases and design
tools to enable designers to incorporate and optimize radiation
shielding into space systems during the initial design phases. Research
under this topic should be conducted to demonstrate technical
feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path forward to Phase 2 hardware
demonstration and, when possible, deliver a full-scale demonstration
unit for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the
Phase 2 contract.\nReference:\nWilson, John W.; Townsend, Lawrence W.;

Scenarios",
        "description": "Lead Center:GRCParticipating
Center(s):JSC\n\nFor exploration missions, a contingency system which
concentrates the oxygen within the cabin environment and provides the
required concentration of oxygen to the crewmember for various medical
scenarios will be necessary. Oxygen concentration technology is being
pursued to concentrate oxygen from the ambient environment so that
oxygen as a consumable resource and the fire hazard of an elevated cabin
 oxygen atmosphere can be reduced. The goal of this project is to
develop an oxygen concentration module that minimizes the hardware mass,
 volume, and power footprint while still performing at the required
clinical capabilities.\n\n\n\nAn Oxygen Concentrator Module (OCM) with
an adjustable positive pressure output 2-15 lpm of O2 at 50% to &gt;90%
oxygen concentrations by volume has been recommended by the flight
medical team. The unit must be able to operate continuously in
microgravity and partial gravity exploration atmospheres that include
the atmospheres of 14.7 psia\/21% oxygen, 10.2 psia\/26.5% oxygen, and
8.2 psia\/34% oxygen by volume. The unit must run continuously on
available spacecraft power, and be switchable between 28 VDC and120 VDC.
 It must have adequate heat rejection so as to not exceed a touch
temperature of 45oC. It is also highly desirable to have a portable low
output capability for use in EVA pre-breathing or patient transfer
between vehicles. Usage scenarios for oxygen treatment of smoke
inhalation or toxic spills also predicates the need for an inlet filter
on the unit that removes (converts\/absorbs\/filters) toxic gases from
the delivered gas stream to the patient.\n\n\n\nThe OCM system should be
 capable of regulating the oxygenation of the patient using a closed
loop feedback system that senses the oxygenation level of the patient
tissues and adjusts the oxygen flow rate and\/or oxygen concentration
according to treatment protocols for the illness being treated. The
system shall also be able to operate open loop in the event of feedback
signal failure. The control variable(s) are not specified
(rate\/concentration) here since the basic unit's topology may dictate
how the regulation is best achieved. Because the system may be
configured during times of duress, it shall be user friendly to the
caretaker by adopting a "plug and play" philosophy.\n\n\n\nThis SBIR
Phase I development is to determine the architecture of such a system
exhibiting the characteristics (high capacity flow range, closed-loop
tissue oxygen control, and operations in microgravity or partial gravity
 exploration atmospheres), a description of the basic unit as a
sub-system component, method of optimizing power over the range of flows
 and oxygen levels, redundancy and sparing for a long duration missions,
 and the relationship of the OCM system to caretaker (what does the
caretaker need to do to fulfill the medical need?).\n\n\n\nPhase I
Requirements - Phase I should concentrate on developing the scientific,
technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of the proposed
innovation resulting in a feasibility report and concept, complete with
analyses that discuss functionality in microgravity and at the proposed
exploration atmospheres, algorithms for closed-loop oxygenation
protocols, and inlet filtering of smoke or toxic gases.\n\n\n\nNASA
Deliverables - A concept for a microgravity and partial gravity
exploration atmospheres oxygen concentrator with a closed loop
oxygenation flow rate system with inlet filtering of potential toxic
ambient gases.\n\n\n\nHRP IRP Risk - Risk of Unacceptable Health and

major concern for long duration space flight. The ability to rapidly
detect changes in bone mineral balance (BMB) in crewmembers living on
ISS would have great potential as a surveillance tool for future
exploration missions. Calcium isotopes have been shown to detect changes
 in BMB on very short timescales (e.g., one week). In order to detect
these important changes, a technological device could be used in-flight.
 Thus, we are seeking a device (portable to bench top size) with the
same accuracy and precision as is currently available in the non-flyable

required to make the Calcium isotope measurements would need to be
approximately 1012-1016 (i.e., this is how sensitive the machine should
be for finding the Calcium isotope; it should be able to pick up one
"atom" or unit in a pool of 1016 other things). Systems that measure
elemental composition typically have sensitivities around 106-109 for
some elements. The absolute concentrations of the isotopes are not
required. We are looking for an instrument that can measure the
variations in the ratio of any two Calcium isotopes on the order of
0.1-0.5 parts per 10,000 (44Ca\/42Ca) but could vary depending on the
isotopes used. A successful proposal will include the technologies being

crewmembers report their sleep duration as requested by their crew
surgeon. This approach has several limitations, including the burden it
places on the crew and the tendency for subjective over-reporting of
sleep (Lauderdale et al., 2008; Van Den Berg et al., 2008; Silva et al.,
 2007). Given evidence that demonstrates the relationship between sleep
and circadian phase and performance, sleep-activity data should be
collected as unobtrusively possible during long duration spaceflight.
Wrist-worn actigraphy has been implemented as a successful, validated
research tool in spaceflight but lacks features to render it a useful
tool operationally, such as real-time feedback and minimal crew time
requirements. Hence, there is a need for a minimally obtrusive or
unobtrusive measure that evaluates sleep-wake activity plus light
exposure; is acceptable for continuous wear; minimizes crew time by
allowing for automatic downloads; provides immediate feedback to the
user; incorporates the constraints of spaceflight hardware, such as
extended battery life; and potentially incorporates other features,
including other physiological sensors. The proposed technology should
build on existing technologies with a focus on enhancing the product to
ensure spaceflight readiness.\n\n\n\nRequirements - Phase I should

Food Technology Project is to develop, evaluate and deliver food
technologies for human centered spacecraft that will support crews on
long duration missions beyond low-Earth orbit. Safe, nutritious,
acceptable, and varied foods with a shelf life of five years will be
required to support the crew. Concurrently, the food system requirements
 must efficiently balance with their use of vehicle resources such as
mass, volume, water, air, waste, power, and crew time.\n\n\n\nNASA
provisions currently consist solely of shelf stable foods due to vehicle
 resource limitations preventing food refrigeration or freezing.
Stability is achieved by thermal, irradiative processing, or drying to
kill or prevent microorganism growth in the food. These methods coupled
with environmental factors (such as moisture ingress and oxidation)
impact the micronutrients within the food. Since the food system is the
sole source of nutrition to the crew, a significant loss in nutrient
availability could jeopardize the health and performance of the
crew.\n\n\n\nThis subtopic requests methods or technologies that enable
development of an acceptable and safe food system to deliver appropriate
 amounts of bioavailable nutrients to crewmembers throughout a five year
 mission with no resupply. Vitamin content in NASA foods, such as
vitamin C, vitamin K, thiamin, and folic acid, are key nutrients
degraded during processing and storage. NASA is seeking novel food
ingredients, protective or stabilizing technologies (e.g.,
encapsulation), controlled-release systems, or novel processing
technologies that allow the delivery of key nutrients at the time of
consumption. Consideration must be given to food safety as well as
acceptability, as under-consumption will similarly lead to nutritional
deficiencies.\n\n\n\nDeliverables - Feasibility demonstration of a novel

 I should include a comprehensive report detailing the system
feasibility, and show a clear path to Phase II development and analyses,

system will retain 70% of original content of vitamin C, vitamin K,

key technology options associated with non-toxic storable liquid
propulsion systems for use in future exploration missions. Efficient
propulsive performance and long duration storage attributes have made
the use of hydrazine widespread across the aerospace community. However,
 hydrazine is highly corrosive and toxic, creating a need for non-toxic,
 high performance propellants for NASA, other government agencies,
academia, and the commercial space industry.\n\n\n\nNon-toxic engine
liquid mono- and bi-propellants technologies are desired for use in lieu
 of the currently operational hydrazine based engine technologies.
Handling and safety concerns with the current toxic chemical propellants
 can lead to more costly propulsion systems. The use of new non-toxic
propellants has the potential to reduce the cost of access to space by
lowering overall life cycle costs.\n\n\n\nDemonstrations of a hydrazine
alternative in a storable liquid mono- or bi-propellant chemical
propulsion system implementation relevant to at least one of the
following applications are desired: in-space reaction control
propulsion, in-space primary propulsion, and launch vehicle reaction
control propulsion. Non-toxic technologies could range from pump fed or
pressure fed thruster systems from 1 to 1000 lbf.\n\n\n\nSpecific
technologies of interest to meet proposed engine requirements
include:\n\n\n\nNon-toxic mono- and bi-propellants that meet performance
 targets (as indicated by high specific impulse and high specific
impulse density) while improving safety and reducing handling operations
 as compared to current state-of-the-art storable
propellants.\n\nAlternate catalysts, ignition technologies to ignite
advanced monopropellants.\n\nAdvanced materials capable of withstanding
hot and corrosive combustion environment of advanced mono- and
bi-propellants.\n\nTechniques that lower the cost of manufacturing
complex components such as injectors, catalysts, and combustion
chambers. Examples include, but are not limited to, development and
demonstration of rapid prototype techniques for metallic parts, powder
metallurgy techniques, and application of nano-technology for near net
shape manufacturing.\n\n\n\nNote to Proposer: Subtopic S3.02 under the
Science Mission Directorate also addresses in-space propulsion.
Proposals more aligned with science mission requirements should be
proposed in S3.02.\n\n\n\nFor all above technologies, research should be
 conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a
 path toward Phase II demonstration, and delivering a demonstration
package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II
contract.\n\n\n\nPhase I Deliverables - Research to identify and
evaluate candidate technology applications to demonstrate the technical
feasibility and show a path towards a demonstration. Bench or lab-level
demonstrations are desirable. The technology concept at the end of Phase
 I should be at a TRL range of 3-4.\n\n\n\nPhase II Deliverables -
Emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating the technology
 under simulated mission conditions. The proposal shall outline a path
showing how the technology could be developed into mission-worthy
systems. The contract should deliver a demonstration unit for functional
 and environmental testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.
The technology concept at the end of Phase II should be at a TRL range
of 4-6.",

Center(s):JSC,ARC,GRC,KSC\n\nThis topic seeks to develop targeted
process technologies and equipment to advance the operability and
reliability of atmosphere revitalization (AR) subsystems that enable
crewed deep space exploration objectives.\n\n\n\nHighly reliable AR
subsystem equipment and process technologies, supplemented by atmosphere
 decontamination equipment and methods, are necessary components to
crewed deep space exploration mission success. While the International
Space Station (ISS) AR subsystem equipment approaches many of the
functional goals necessary for deep space exploration mission success,
flight operational experience has identified areas for improvement in
resource recovery and rapid atmosphere decontamination capabilities.
Technologies related to resource recovery include gas compression and
management as well as gas separations. Rapid atmosphere decontamination
capabilities are needed to remove the functional burden for recovering
from a contamination event, such as a fire or chemical spill, from the
primary AR subsystem equipment. Details in each functional area of
interest are provided by the following:\n\n\n\nGas Compression and
Management - NASA is seeking safe, compact, quiet, long-lived, and
efficient ways to compress, store, and deliver gaseous oxygen and carbon
 dioxide within an AR subsystem. Also, methods to store, condition, and
deliver reactant gases, primarily carbon dioxide, to carbon dioxide
reduction process equipment are sought. Present AR equipment aboard ISS
consists of power-intensive, noisy compressors that have service lives
less than 2 years. Significant acoustic treatment is necessary to
achieve NC-40 criteria. Applications for deep space exploration missions
 include but are not limited to production of high pressure oxygen for
EVA use, and compression and storage of carbon dioxide for use in carbon
 dioxide reduction systems. Improvements in service life, reliability,
and mechanical compression for atmospheric gas recharge to pressures up
to 3,600 psia, including long life and reliability, and novel methods to
 increase tank storage capacity at lower pressures are of particular
interest.\n\nHydrogen Purification for Resource Recovery - Resource
recovery and recycling is an enabling functional area for the AR
subsystems needed for long-duration missions. For this purpose, NASA is
interested in a regenerative separation technology to enable maximum
hydrogen recovery from a stream containing water vapor (saturated),
carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbons including methane, acetylene,
ethane, and ethylene, among others. While a high quantity of methane in
the hydrogen product stream is acceptable, and even desirable, the
presence of CO, water, and other hydrocarbons is highly undesirable.
Final gas composition must be &gt;99% hydrogen with some allowable
methane and the dewpoint must be less than -60 0C. System concepts must
strive to minimize power, mass, and consumable requirements while
maximizing efficiency, operational life, and reliability. \n\nPost-Fire
Cabin Atmosphere Cleanup - A portable, self-contained fire and toxic
atmosphere cleanup system is desired that can rapidly remove
contaminants from a spacecraft volume, to quickly and effectively
decontaminate cabin atmosphere after a fire. The capability to reduce
starting concentrations by &gt;80% within 15 minutes for a 100-m3 volume
 is desired. Methods have involved either deploying a filter assembly to
 the commode after a fire and using the commode fan as the source of
airflow or attaching a series of filters to a portable fan using an
adapter kit. Both methods result in low atmospheric scrubbing flow rates
 and significant time for deployment as well as limited capacity and
non-specific scrubbing. Russian-provided portable equipment aboard the
ISS provides 65 m3 \/h flow through a replaceable cartridge. The
equipment's mass is 17 kg and the power consumption is 150 W. Filter
service life is 7.5 hours. The dimensions are approximately 33 cm
diameter and 35 cm tall. Future equipment must provide the rapid
contamination reduction within the characteristic size and performance
envelope of the Russian-developed portable scrubbing device.\n\n\n\nFor
each technical area, projects are sought to research and demonstrate
technical feasibility during Phase I that will develop a clear technical
 maturation path towards Phase II hardware development and
demonstration. Phase II products must include a demonstration unit
suitable for testing by NASA.\n\n\n\nPhase I Deliverables -
Documentation, data, and feasibility assessment proving the proposed
approach is suitable to develop the proposed product (at least TRL 3 at
completion according to NPR 7123.1 TRL definition). A breadboard
developmental unit is desirable.\n\n\n\nPhase II Deliverables -
Functional engineering development unit at a minimum high fidelity
breadboard (brassboard fidelity preferred), defined by NPR 7120.8, and
technical maturity level 4 (TRL 4 defined by NPR 7123.1) of the proposed
 product, along with a full report of developmental and performance
results, including drawings, analyses, and models as applicable.
Opportunities and plans should also be identified and summarized for
potential commercialization.",

Center(s):MSFC,KSC,ARC\n\nHabitation systems that are dispersed
throughout a spacecraft volume need to be investigated as a system to
improve future human accommodations. Current spacecraft interiors exceed
 acoustic limits from a wide range of equipment; have manual inventory
tracking and no capability for assistance of lost items; and require
substantial crew time and wipes for cleaning common crew surfaces (hand
rails and panels) and water\/solids hygiene surfaces. Future spacecraft
interiors will need to be reconfigurable to meet changing crew needs as a
 mission moves from launch, transit, and exploration-destination phases.
 Adaptable distributed habitation technologies are needed in the
following areas.\n\n\n\nQuiet Crew Cabin Environments - Smaller future
vehicles will unlikely have dedicated quiet volumes for crew rest so
maintaining a quiet cabin is required. Crew cabin acoustic noise
mitigation needs to control noise levels to enable improved voice
communication, alarm signal to noise ratio, and reduce crew fatigue from
 long duration noise exposure. There is need for non-wearable active and
 passive noise cancellation\/reduction strategies for open crew cabin
environment that do not impede voice or alarms. Need for adaptive broad
coverage area to accommodate changing crew cabin layout and
volume.\n\nCrew Item Location Capability - Significant crew time is lost
 in tracking or locating items at the piece part level in space habitat
environment that serves both as living quarters and laboratory. Items
are sometimes misplaced or simply float away in the microgravity
environment. Innovative approaches are sought for automatic location and
 tracking of a large number of individual crew items as they move from
their original launch configuration to any area in the crew cabin. Crew
items range in size from pill size, hand tools, clothing, and spare
equipment and vary in material composition from non-metallic, metallic,
to fluid containing. There is a need for low-power, and miniature Radio
Frequency Identification (RFID) readers for dense storage and sparse tag
 environments. Flexible reader deployment that allows individual item
autonomous logistics management tracking and precise 3-D locating are
desired. Solutions providing enhanced localization utilizing the
EPCglobal UHF reader-tag protocols (Class 1 Gen2 or advanced classes)
are of high interest. Similar types of reader-tag communication
protocols at higher frequencies that enable more accurate spatial
localization are also of interest. Innovative algorithmic solutions for
finding lost items, based on RFID or similar sensory information, are
also of interest. All solutions must accommodate a highly reflective and
 complex scattering environment such as a conductive habitat cylindrical
 volume of ~ 3.5 m diameter ~6 m in length.\n\nCrew Cabin Surfaces -
Crew activity and surface contact of fabric and solid surfaces result in
 generation and accumulation of particulate, moisture, organic, and
salt. Surface treatments for fabrics and solid surfaces to prevent this
accumulation of contaminants are needed to reduce crew time and the
large number of wipes used for cleaning.  Innovative low out gassing,
super hydrophobic, super hydrophilic, antistatic, and antimicrobial
treatments are needed for crew hygiene areas and waste collection
hardware is needed. Non-mechanical fastener\/non-particle generating
removable physical connections are needed for repeated reconfiguring of
interior volumes on longer missions. Examples of the types of temporary
and reversible physical connections include crew restraints (e.g., hand
rails), close out panels, and the hook-and-loop type fasteners present
on most crew items.\n\n\n\nPhase I Deliverables - Detailed analysis,
proof of concept test data, material test coupons, key algorithms\/
subroutines, and predicted performance comparison to industry state of
the art.\n\n\n\nPhase II Deliverables - Comparison of analysis to
prototype test data in representative environment, sufficient material

functional breadboard component hardware and\/or system, and operations

reliability of water recovery systems, so these systems require less
crew intervention and a lower risk of failure with longer operational
lifetimes. With these goals in mind, two areas of interest have been
identified for further focus:\n\n\n\nWater Recovery Post-Processing
Systems - Technologies are needed to increase the reliability of systems
 for polishing of partially-treated wastewater. The current state of the
 art uses catalytic oxidation to remove dissolved organic carbon
contaminants. Technologies that operate below 100 0C or ambient pressure
 are desirable. Examples of these technologies include low-temperature
catalytic oxidation, photolysis, or photocatalysis.\n\nMonitoring
Systems for Mineral Species in Water &amp; Wastewater - A capability is
needed to measure dissolved mineral ions in water and wastewater,
including polyatomic ions (could encompass organic ions) and the
alkaline, alkaline-earth and transition metals. Multi-analyte capability
 is needed, such as that available from ion chromatography and plasma

technology readiness levels of lightweight metals and manufacturing
techniques for launch vehicles and in-space applications resulting in
structures having affordable, reliable, predictable performance with
reduced costs. Technologies developed under this subtopic are of
interest to NASA programs such as Space Launch System (SLS),
Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV), Orion, and commercial launch
providers.\n\n\n\nMetallic additive manufacturing (AM) technology builds
 near-net shape components one layer at a time using metal powder bed or
 wire fed processes and data from 3-D CAD models. Metallic AM
technologies like Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Direct Metal Laser
Sintering (DMLS), Electron Beam Freeform Fabrication (EBF3), and Laser
Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) are of interest to NASA for fabrication of
 advanced metallic aerospace components and in-space fabrication and
repair. These technologies enable the direct fabrication of net or
near-net shape components without the need for tooling and with minimal
or no machining thereby reducing component lead time, manufacturing
cost, and material waste. Metallic AM also has the potential to enable
novel product designs that could not be fabricated using conventional
subtractive machining processes and extends the life of in-service parts
 through innovative repair methodologies. Currently, some metallic AM
systems use sensors for process control but not for in-situ quality
assurance (QA) or flaw detection.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this subtopic is
 to invest in mid- and long-term research to establish rigorous,
systematic, and scalable verification and validation methods for
metallic AM. Beam tracking errors, part distortion, feedstock nozzle
stand-off distance variability, excessive heat build-up in the deposit,
stuck or unmelted feedstock, etc. can contribute to build deposit
geometric anomalies and discontinuities. The objective would be to
achieve a capability to have in-situ assessment during the deposition
process to provide immediate feedback to the operator or a closed loop
control system to enable real-time process correction or remedial
actions to correct for defects. Although the technologies developed may
be specific to one metallic AM system, it is desired that they have
cross cutting capabilities to other metallic AM technologies. Proposals
are invited that: \n\n\n\nExplore new and improved sensors and sensor
systems for monitoring of the metallic AM build deposit. \n\nOffer
technologies to use the signals generated by the energy beam (either
electron beam or laser) or beam \/ substrate emissions for in-situ
process monitoring and quality assurance. \n\nPropose additional devices
 to support real-time geometric part inspection and identification of
flaws (voids, cracks, lack of fusion defects or other
discontinuities).\n\n\n\nTechnologies should enable determination of the
 boundaries of the molten pool within 0.001" (in order to define the
size and shape), measurement of temperature over the range from 700 0F
to 3000 0F (representative of the molten pool and surrounding regions)
to within 25 0F, measurement of geometric features to within +0.005",
detect flaws in the range of 0.010 - 0.001", and determine chemical
composition within 1 weight percent. Technologies should be compatible
with standard high speed computer communication protocols and sensors
should be able to update at frequencies on the order of 10 Hz. Highly
desirable attributes are that technologies enable non-contact sensing
and measurement, are vacuum compatible, and are relatively insensitive
to contamination. Desirable attributes include that technologies are
non-hazardous, do not require the use of additional consumables, and do
not introduce contaminants into the process.\n\n\n\nResearch should be
conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility in Phase I and show a
path toward demonstration in Phase II of in-situ process monitoring and
quality assurance. Phase II proposals should include delivery of a
prototype system for test and evaluation in environments representative
of NASA's metallic AM systems. Expected Technology Readiness Levels

of Phase II projects.\n\n\n\nLinks to information about NASA's additive

deployable solar arrays, having up to 100 m2 of solar cell area and 25
kW of electrical power. NASA has a vital interest in developing much
larger arrays over the next 20 years with up to 4000 m2 of deployed area
 (1 MW) for exploration missions using solar electric propulsion (SEP).
Scaling up solar array deployed surface area by more than an
order-of-magnitude will require game changing innovations. In
particular, novel flexible-substrate designs are needed that minimize
structural mass and packaging volume while maximizing deployment
reliability, deployed stiffness, deployed strength, and longevity. Most
of the mass savings in these very large future arrays will probably come
 from improvements to solar array supporting structures, not from
improvements in the solar cells mounted on the arrays.\n\n\n\nNASA is
currently developing solar array systems for SEP in the 30-50 kW power
range. This SBIR subtopic seeks innovative structures and materials
technologies and capabilities for the next generation of lightweight
solar arrays beyond 50 kW. Technologies are needed for the design and
verification of large deployable solar arrays with:\n\n\n\n200-400 m2 of
 deployed area (50-100 kW) in 3-5 years.\n\n400-1200 m2 of deployed area

kW) in 10-20 years.\n\n\n\nThese deployed areas are typically divided
between two solar array wings, with each wing requiring half of the
specified area.\n\n\n\nThis subtopic seeks innovations in the following
areas for future large solar array structures:\n\n\n\nNovel design,
packaging, deployment, and in-space manufacturing and assembly
concepts.\n\nLightweight, compact components including booms, ribs,
substrates, and mechanisms.\n\nValidated modeling, analysis, and
simulation techniques.\n\nGround and in-space test methods.\n\nLoad

in-house large solar array concept referred to as the Government

studies. Improved packaging, joints, deployment methods, etc. to enable

Materials and Manufacturing concentrates on developing lightweight
structures, using advanced materials technologies and new manufacturing
processes. The objective of the subtopic is to advance technology
readiness levels of PMC materials and manufacturing for launch vehicles
and in-space applications resulting in structures having affordable,
reliable and predictable performance. The subtopic will address two
areas, manufacturing of structures and highly damage-tolerant materials
for use in cryogenic environments. Proposals to each area will be
considered separately. Areas of interest include: advances in PMC
materials for large-scale structures and for in-space applications;
innovative automated manufacturing processes (e.g., fiber placement);
advanced non-autoclave curing; damage-tolerant\/repairable structures;
low-cost, durable tooling; high temperature PMC materials for high
performance composite structures (high temperature applications); and
materials with high resistance to micro cracking at cryogenic
temperatures. Reliable, affordable, and practical joining techniques for
 large segmented composite structures are desired.\n\n\n\nLightweight
structures and PMC materials have been identified as a critical need for
 launch vehicles since the reduction of structural mass translates
directly to vehicle additional performance, reduced cost, and increased
payload mass capacity. Reliable large-scale (approximately 8 meters or
greater in diameter) PMC structures will be critical to the "heavy lift"
 of America's next-generation space fleet. The capability to transfer
and store for long-term propellant, particularly cryogenic propellants
in orbit, can significantly increase the nation's ability to conduct
complex and extended exploration missions beyond Earth's orbit. The use
of PMC materials for cryotanks offers the potential of significant
weight savings. Applications include storage of cryogenic propellants on
 an Earth Departure Stage, a lunar or asteroid descent vehicle,
long-term cryogen storage on the Moon, and propellant tanks for a heavy
lift launch vehicle. Consideration shall be made for manufacturability
in the sense of either using out of autoclave cure or autoclave cure
and, in made in sections, novel and reliable approaches to join sections
 of composite structures to take advantage of the high strength to
weight properties so that the joining methods do not significantly
increase the complexity or weight of the overall structure. Novel
approaches from cradle to grave will be considered in the sense that
these very large structures required robust and lightweight tooling and
transportation methods for minimal modifications to existing facilities
and use of existing transportation or minimal modifications to such
infrastructures.\n\n\n\nPerformance metrics for manufacturing structures
 include: achieving adequate structural and weight performance;
manufacturing and life cycle affordability analysis; verifiable
practices for scale-up; validation of confidence in design, materials
performance, and manufacturing processes; low-cost, durable tooling; and
 quantitative risk reduction capability. Research should be conducted to
 demonstrate novel approaches, technical feasibility, and basic
performance characterization for polymer matrix composite structures or
low-cost, durable tooling during Phase I, and show a path toward a Phase
 II design allowables and prototype demonstration. Emphasis should be on
 demonstrable manufacturing technology that can be scaled up for very
large structures.\n\n\n\nPerformance metrics for materials developed for
 cryotanks are: temperature-dependent material properties including
strength, modulus, CTE, and fracture toughness; and demonstrated
improved resistance over present SOA of multi-directional laminates to
microcracking under cryogenic temperature cycling. Initial property
characterization would be done at the coupon level in Phase I.
Generation of design allowables, characterization of long-term material
durability, and fabrication of larger panels would be part of follow-on
efforts.\n\n\n\nHigh temperature polymer matrices for high performance

 of 200 W\/cm2 and pressures of 0.3 atm and improve on the
state-of-the-art areal mass of 1.0 g\/cm2 required to maintain a
bondline temperature below 250 0C\n\nThe second class of materials, for
planetary aerocapture and entry for a deployable aerodynamic
decelerator, will need to survive a single or dual heating exposure,
with the first (or single pulse) at heat fluxes of 50-150 W\/cm2
(primarily convective) and integrated heat loads of 10 kJ\/cm2 and the
second at heat fluxes of 30-50 W\/cm2 and heat loads of 5 kJ\/cm2. These
 materials may be either flexible or deployable.\n\nThe third class of
materials, for higher velocity (&gt;11.5km\/s) Earth return, will need
to survive heat fluxes of 1500-2500 W\/cm2, with radiation contributing
up to 75% of that flux, and integrated heat loads from 75-150 kJ\/cm2.
These materials, or material systems must improve on the current
state-of-the-art recession rates of 1.00 mm\/s at heating rates of 2000
W\/cm2 and pressures of 0.3 atm and improve on the state-of-the-art
areal mass of 4.0 g\/cm2, required to maintain a bondline temperature
below 250 0C.\n\nDevelopment of in-situ heat flux sensors, surface
recession diagnostics, and in-depth or interface thermal response
measurement devices for use on rigid and\/or flexible ablative
materials. In-situ heat flux sensors and surface recession diagnostics
tools are needed for flight systems to provide better traceability from
the modeling and design tools to actual performance. The resultant data
will lead to higher fidelity design tools, risk reduction, decreased
heat shield mass and increases in direct payload. The heat flux sensors
should be accurate within 20%, surface recession diagnostic sensors
should be accurate within 10%, and any temperature sensors should be
accurate within 5% of actual values.\n\nNon Destructive Evaluation (NDE)
 tools for evaluation of bondline and in-depth integrity for light
weight rigid and\/or flexible ablative materials. Non Destructive
Evaluation (NDE) tools are sought to verify design requirements are met
during manufacturing and assembly of the heat shield, e.g., verifying
that anisotropic materials have been installed in their proper
orientation, that the bondline as well as the TPS materials have the
proper integrity and are free of voids or defects. Void and\/or defect
detection requirements will depend upon the materials being inspected.
Typical internal void detection requirements are on the order of 6 mm,
and bondline defect detection requirements are on the order of 25.4 mm
by 25.4 mm by the thickness of the adhesive.\n\nAdvances are sought in
ablation modeling, including radiation, convection, gas surface
interactions, pyrolysis, coking, and charring for low and mid-density
fiber based (woven or felt) ablative materials. There is a specific need
 for improved models for low and mid density as well as multi-layered
charring ablators (with different chemical composition in each layer).
Consideration of the non-equilibrium states of the pyrolysis gases and
the surface thermochemistry, as well as the potential to couple the
resulting models to a computational fluid dynamics solver, should be
included in the modeling efforts.\n\n\n\nStarting Technology Readiness
Levels (TRL) of 2-3 or higher are sought.\n\n\n\nFor all above
technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical
feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II
hardware\/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit
or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II
contract.\n\n\n\nPhase I Deliverables - Feasibility study, including
simulations and measurements, proving the proposed approach to develop a
 given product (TRL 3). Small samples and initial test data may be
provided to demonstrate feasibility. Development of the verification
matrix of measurements to be performed at the end of Phase II, along
with specific quantitative pass-fail ranges for each quantity

proposed product, along with full report of development and
measurements, including populated verification matrix from Phase I (TRL
4-5). Opportunities and plans should also be identified and summarized
for potential commercialization.",

Center(s):GSFC\n\nNASA is seeking proposals to develop advanced
celestial navigation techniques and system in support of deep-space
missions. Advances in positioning, attitude estimation, orbit
determination, time and frequency keeping and dissemination and orbit
determination are sought. System and sub-system concepts should support
significant advances of independence from Earth supervision including
the ability to operate effectively in the absence of Earth-based
transmissions or transmissions from planetary relay spacecraft while
minimizing spacecraft burden by requiring low power and minimal mass and
 volume. While system concepts that operate in the complete absence of
human intervention or Earth-based transmissions are preferred, testing
and verification of proposed systems performance will, necessarily,
include Earth-based systems.\n\n\n\nOperation during all phases of
mission operations, including cruise phase, orbit phase and
circularization phases are of interest. An application of interest is to
 enable open-loop (i.e., beaconless) pointing of high rate optical
communications terminals to earth terminals. Methods and systems should
be sufficient accuracy to support this capability; however, concepts
which are capable of supporting planetary missions of any type are of
interest.\n\n\n\nSubjects appropriate for this sub-topic include, but
are not limited to:\n\n\n\nAdvanced methods and sensors for optical\/IR
detection of star fields (i.e., star cameras).\n\nAdvanced methods and
sensors detecting RF and x-ray pulsars.\n\nMethods to process celestial
observations to perform Orbit Determination (OD) and precision attitude

(e.g., supervisory control) should identify gaps in the knowledge base
that are particular to the use of advanced celestial methods, unique to
the deep space navigation problem. User spacecraft impact is of
significant importance and proposed solutions include assessments of
mass, power, thermal impact on targeted mission spacecraft. Current and
past mission spacecraft may be used as paradigms. Proposals that include
 re-purposing\/cross-purposing of advanced sensors contemplated for
future deep-space missions such as x-ray telescopes are
preferred.\n\n\n\nResearch should be conducted to demonstrate technical
feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II hardware

Technology Area supports all NASA space missions with the development of
 new capabilities and services that make our missions possible.
Communication links are the lifelines to our spacecraft that provide the
 command, telemetry, and science data transfers as well as navigation
support. Advancement in communication and navigation technology will
allow future missions to implement new and more capable science
instruments, greatly enhance human missions beyond Earth orbit, and
enable entirely new mission concepts. NASA's communication and
navigation capability is based on the premise that communications shall
enable and not constrain missions. \n\nToday our communication and
navigation capabilities, using Radio Frequency technology, can support
our spacecraft to the fringes of the solar system and beyond. As we move
 into the future, we are challenged to increase current data rates - 300
 Mbps in LEO to about 6 Mbps at Mars - to support the anticipated
numerous missions for space science, Earth science and exploration of
the universe. Technologies such as optical communications, RF including
antennas and ground based Earth stations, surface networks, cognitive
networks, access links, reprogrammable communications systems, advanced
antenna technology, transmit array concepts, and communications in
support of launch services are very important to the future of
exploration and science activities of the Agency. Additionally,
innovative, relevant research in the areas of positioning, navigation,
and timing (PNT) are desirable. NASA\u0092s Space Communication and
Navigation (SCaN) Office considers the three elements of PNT to
represent distinct, constituent capabilities: (1) positioning, by which
we mean accurate and precise determination of an asset\u0092s location
and orientation referenced to a coordinate system; (2) navigation, by
which we mean determining an asset\u0092s current and\/or desired
absolute or relative position and velocity state, and applying
corrections to course, orientation, and velocity to attain achieve the
desired state; and (3) timing, by which we mean an asset\u0092s
acquiring from a standard, maintaining within user-defined parameters,
and transferring where required, an accurate and precise representation
of time, minimize the impact of latency on overall system performance.
 \n\nThis year, the following technology areas are being solicited to
meet increasing data throughput and accuracy needs:  Optical
communications, RF communications, reprogrammable communications systems
 and flight dynamics.  Emphasis is placed on size, weight and power
improvements. Innovative solutions centered on operational issues are
needed in all of the aforementioned areas. All technologies developed
under this topic area to be aligned with the Architecture Definition

        "topic_name": "Lidar Remote Sensing Technologies",
        "description": "Lead Center:LaRCParticipating
Center(s):GSFC,JPL\n\nNASA recognizes the potential of lidar technology
in meeting many of its science objectives by providing new capabilities
or offering enhancements over current measurements of atmospheric and
topographic parameters from ground, airborne, and space-based platforms.
 To meet NASA's requirements, advances are needed in state-of-the-art
lidar technology with an emphasis on compactness, efficiency,
reliability, lifetime, and high performance. Innovative lidar subsystem
and component technologies systems that directly address the measurement
 of atmospheric constituents and surface topography of the Earth, Mars,
the Moon, and other planetary bodies will be considered under this
subtopic.\n\n\n\nProposals relevant to the development of lidar
instruments that can be used in planned missions or current technology
programs are highly encouraged. Examples of planned missions and
technology programs are: \n\n\n\nActive Sensing of CO2 Emissions over
Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS). \n\nAerosols-Clouds-Ecosystems
(ACE). \n\nDoppler Wind Lidar (3D-WINDS). \n\nLaser Interferometer Space
 Antenna (LISA). \n\nOzone Lidar. \n\nLidar for Surface Topography
(LIST). \n\nMars atmospheric sensing, atmospheric entry and descent
sensors for Mars and Earth, and tracking large-scale water movement
(GRACE-II). \n\n\n\nIn addition, innovative technologies relevant to the
 NASA sub-orbital programs, such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and
Venture-class focusing on the studies of the Earth climate, carbon
cycle, weather, and atmospheric composition, are being sought. Compact,
high efficiency lidar instruments for deployment on unconventional
platforms, such as balloon, small sat, and cube sat, are also considered
 and encouraged.\n\n\n\nThe proposals should target advancement of lidar
 technologies for eventual space utilization. Phase I research should
demonstrate the technical feasibility and show a path toward a Phase II
prototype unit. Phase II prototypes should be capable of laboratory
demonstration and preferably suitable for operation in the field from a
ground-based station, an aircraft platform, or any science platform
amply defended by the proposer. For the 2014 SBIR Program, we are
soliciting the component and subsystem technologies described
below.\n\n\n\nSolid state, single frequency, pulsed, laser transmitters
operating in the 1.0 \u03bcm to1.7 \u03bcm range with a wall-plug
efficiency of greater than 25% suitable for CO2 measurement, and
free-space laser communication applications. The laser transmitters must
 be capable of generating frequency transform-limited pulses with a
quality beam M2 of less than 1.5 with an approximately 20 W of average
power. We are interested in two different regimes of repetition rates:
from 5 kHz to 20 kHz, and from 20 Hz to 100 Hz. In addition, development
 of non-traditional optical amplifier architectures that yield optical
efficiency of &gt;70% are of interest.\n\n\n\nCompact and rugged
single-frequency CW laser systems operating at 1.06 mm, 1.57 mm, 1.651
mm and 2.05 mm wavelengths suitable for precision space interferometry
applications such as LISA, GRACE-II, and coherent detection lidars. The
lasers must be developed with space environment considerations and
demonstrate a clear path to space. Proposed lasers must be able to
generate at least 20 mW of power with less than 10 kHz linewidth over a
tunable range of about 50 nm. Systems must be highly wavelength stable
and come with full supporting electronic systems for thermal and power
control.\n\n\n\nLong wavelength solid state laser transmitter technology
 (e 10 \u03bcm) is needed for atmospheric lidar and possible terrain
altimeter instruments for Venus. The highly dense atmosphere, volatile
clouds, and thick scattering layers make this measurement a low
probability event, but should be possible with significant pulse
energies at long wavelengths. In combination of large, lightweight
receiver, we can maximize the possibility of achieving a round trip
remote sensing link from low Venus orbit. Minimum pulse energies of e
100 mJ are needed to reach the surface in the best conditions, such as
with periodic holes and gaps in the clouds. Repetition rates of e 10Hz
are desired for reasonable footprint spacing should a link be
achieved.\n\n\n\nUltra-low noise photo receiver modules, operating
either at 1.6 or 2.0 micron wavelengths for measuring CO2 concentration,
 comprising of the detection device, complete Dewar\/cooling systems,
and associated amplifiers. General requirements are: large active
detection diameter (&gt;200 micron), high quantum efficiency (&gt;85%),
noise equivalent power of the order of 10-14 W\/sqrt(Hz), and bandwidth
greater than 20 MHz.\n\n\n\nLightweight scanning telescopes capable of a
 conical pattern with nadir angle fixed in the range of 30 to 45
degrees. The lightweight scanning telescopes are sought for both direct
and heterodyne detection wind lidars and tropospheric ozone lidars. For
winds, the direct detection lidar operates in 355 nm to 1064 nm
wavelength region and the heterodyne detection lidar in 1550 nm to 2050
nm. For ozone, these systems should operate between 280-300 nm. The
ozone systems are designed to support NASA's TOLNet network providing
data for satellite validation and the study of anthropogenic pollution.
High optical efficiency and near diffraction-limited performance are
among major considerations. The proposer must show a clear path to space
 by addressing scalability to apertures greater than 1 m, materials
(e.g., substrates and coatings) selection compatible with a space
environment, and thermally-stable design. Phase II should result in a
prototype unit capable of demonstration in a high-altitude aircraft
environment, with aperture of at least 10 inches in diameter.",

plasma environment, surface electric field, secondary radiation at the
lunar surface, and dust concentrations and its diurnal dynamics are
sought. Further, lunar regolith particle analysis techniques are desired

automate integration of suites of multiple back scatter electron images
acquired at different operating conditions, as well as permit
integration of other data such as cathodoluminescence and
energy-dispersive x-ray analysis).\n\n\n\nProposers are strongly
encouraged to relate their proposed development to NASA's future
planetary exploration goals and existing flight instrument capability,

objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the subtopics reflect
 a focus on instrument development for airborne and Unmanned Aerial

detailed inner structure of galaxies with very bright nuclei, binary
star formation, and stellar evolution. Contrast ratios of one million to

current optomechanical technologies. Mission concepts for New Worlds
science would require 10 - 30 m class, cost-effective telescope
observatories that are diffraction limited at wavelengths from the
visible to the far IR, and operate at temperatures from 4 - 300 K. In
addition, ground based telescopes such as the Cerro Chajnantor Atacama

desired areal density is 1 - 10 kg\/m2 with a packaging efficiency of
3-10 deployed\/stowed diameter. Static and dynamic wavefront error
tolerances to thermal and dynamic perturbations may be achieved through
passive means (e.g., via a high stiffness system, passive thermal

external occulters are also relevant technologies. Potential
architecture implementations must package into an existing launch
volume, deploy and be self-aligning to the micron level. The target

include:\n\n\n\nPrecision deployable structures and metrology for
optical telescopes (e.g., innovative active or passive deployable

and deployment designs for large sunshields and external

path toward a Phase II delivery of demonstration hardware scalable to 5
meter diameter for ground test characterization.\n\n\n\nBefore embarking
 on the design and fabrication of complex space-based deployable
telescopes, additional risk reduction in operating an actively

potential UV\/Optical missions.\n\n\n\nProposals should show an
understanding of one or more relevant science needs, and present a
feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA
program.\n\n\n\nThe primary emphasis of this subtopic is to mature
technologies needed to manufacture, test or operate complete mirror
systems or telescope assemblies. Section 3 contains a detailed
discussion on specific technologies which need developing for each
area.\n\n\n\nThe 2010 National Academy AstrO2010 Decadal Report
specifically identifies optical components and coatings as key
technologies needed to enable several different future missions,
including:\n\n\n\nLight-weight x-ray imaging mirrors for future large
advanced x-ray observatories.\n\nLarge aperture, light-weight mirrors
for future UV\/Optical telescopes.\n\nBroadband high reflectance
coatings for future UV\/Optical telescopes.\n\n\n\nThe 2012 National
Academy report "NASA Space Technology Roadmaps and Priorities" states
that one of the top technical challenges in which NASA should invest
over the next five years is developing a new generation of larger
effective aperture, lower-cost astronomical telescopes that enable
discovery of habitable planets, facilitate advances in solar physics,
and enable the study of faint structures around bright objects. To
enable this capability requires low-cost, ultra-stable, large-aperture,
normal and grazing incidence mirrors with low mass-to-collecting area
ratios. To enable these new astronomical telescopes, the report
identifies three specific optical systems technologies:\n\n\n\nActive
align\/control of grazing-incidence imaging systems to achieve &lt; 1
arc-second angular resolution.\n\nActive align\/control of
normal-incidence imaging systems to achieve 500 nm diffraction limit (40
 nm rms wavefront error, WFE) performance.\n\nNormal incidence 4-meter
(or larger) diameter 5 nm rms WFE (300 nm system diffraction limit)
mirrors.\n\n\n\nFinally, impacting potential space telescopes, NASA is
developing a heavy lift space launch system (SLS). An SLS with an 8 to
10 meter fairing and 80 to 100 mt capacity to LEO would enable extremely
 large space telescopes. Potential systems include 12 to 30 meter class
segmented primary mirrors for UV\/optical or infrared wavelengths and 8
to 16 meter class segmented x-ray telescope mirrors. These potential
future space telescopes have very specific mirror technology needs.
UV\/optical telescopes (such as ATLAST-9 or ATLAST-16) require 1 to 3
meter class mirrors with &lt; 5 nm rms surface figures. IR telescopes
(such as SAFIR\/CALISTO) require 2 to 3 to 8 meter class mirrors with
cryo-deformations &lt; 100 nm rms. X-ray telescopes (such as GenX)
require 1 to 2 meter long grazing incidence segments with angular
resolution &lt; 0.5 arc-sec and surface micro-roughness &lt; 0.5-nm
rms.\n\n\n\nTechnical Challenges:\n\n\n\nIn all cases, the most
important metric for an advanced optical system (after performance) is
affordability or areal cost (cost per square meter of collecting
aperture). Currently both x-ray and normal incidence space mirrors cost
$4 million to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area. This
research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components
by 5 to 50 times, to less than $1M to $100K\/m2.\n\n\n\nSuccessful
proposals shall provide a scale-up roadmap (including processing and
infrastructure issues) for full scale space qualifiable flight optics
systems. Material behavior, process control, active and\/or passive
optical performance, and mounting\/deploying issues should be resolved
and demonstrated.\n\n\n\nOptical Components, Coatings and Systems for
Potential X-ray Missions\n\n\n\nPotential x-ray missions
require:\n\n\n\nX-ray imaging telescopes with  1 to 5 m2 collecting
area.\n\nMultilayer high-reflectance coatings for hard x-ray mirrors
(similar to NuSTAR).\n\nX-ray transmission and\/or reflection
gratings.\n\n\n\nRegarding x-ray telescope, multiple technologies are
needed to enable &lt; 1 arc-sec x-ray observatories. These include, but
are not limited to: new materials such as silicon carbide, porous
silicon, beryllium; improved techniques to manufacture (such as direct
precision machining, rapid optical fabrication, slumping or replication
technologies) 0.3 to 2 meter diameter mirror shells or segments;
improved metrology, performance prediction and testing techniques;
active control of mirror shape; new structures for holding and actively
aligning of mirrors in a telescope assembly.\n\n\n\nFor example, the
Wide-Field X-Ray Telescope (WFXT) requires a 6 meter focal length x-ray
mirror with 1 arc-sec resolution and 1 m2 of collecting area. One
implementation of this mirror has 71 concentric full shell
hyperbola\/parabola pairs whose diameters range from 0.3 to 1.0 meter
and whose length is 150 to 240 mm (this length is split between the H\/P
 pair). Total mass for the integrated mirror system (shells and
structure) is &lt; 1000 kg. For individual mirror shells, axial slope
errors should be ~ 1 arc-sec rms (~100 nm rms figure error for 20 mm
spatial frequencies) and surface finish should be &lt; 0.5 nm
rms.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, potential Heliophysics missions require a
grazing incidence telescope with an effective collecting area of ~3 cm2
for 0.1 to 4 nm wavelengths, 4 meter effective focal length, 0.8 degree
angle of incidence and surface roughness of 0.2 nm rms.\n\n\n\nRegarding
 x-ray coatings, future x-ray missions require multilayer depth gradient
 coatings with high broadband reflectivity for 5 to 80 keV energy
photons.\n\n\n\nRegarding improved metrology and performance prediction,
 technology is needed to fully characterize x-ray mirrors (and mandrels)
 and predict their angular resolution performance. Potential solutions
include (but are not limited to): both sub-aperture stitching (in the
lateral direction) to acquire data over the entire optical surface, and
merging\/interpolating data with different spatial frequency domains.
This can be done using different surface measuring instruments with
different fields of view and resolutions.\n\n\n\nSuccessful proposals
will demonstrate an ability to manufacture, test and control a prototype
 0.25 to 0.5 meter diameter x-ray mirror assembly; or, to coat a 0.25 to
 0.5 meter class representative optical component; or, to characterize
and performance predict a 0.5 to 1.0 meter class x-ray mirror or
mandrel. An ideal Phase I project would deliver a sub-scale component
such as a 0.25 meter x-ray precision mirror; or demonstrate a prototype
metrology system capable of characterizing the optical surface
morphology of an x-ray component and predicting its angular performance.
 An ideal Phase II project would further advance the technology to
produce a space-qualifiable 0.5 meter mirror, with a TRL in the 4 to 5
range; or deliver a metrology system capable of characterizing 0.5 to
1.0 meter class x-ray mirrors (or mandrels) and predicting their angular
 resolution performance. Both Phase I and Phase II deliverables would be
 accompanied by all necessary documentation, including the optical
performance assessment and all data on processing and properties of its
substrate materials. The Phase II would also include a mechanical and

missions require:\n\n\n\nLarge aperture, light-weight
mirrors.\n\nBroadband high reflectance coatings.\n\n\n\nRegarding large
aperture mirrors, future UVOIR missions require 4 to 8 or 16 meter
monolithic or segmented primary mirrors with &lt; 10 nm rms surface
figures. Mirror areal density depends upon available launch vehicle
capacities to Sun-Earth L2 (i.e., 15 kg\/m2 for a 5 m fairing EELV vs.
60 kg\/m2 for a 10 m fairing SLS).\n\n\n\nRegarding broadband
reflectance coating, future UVOIR missions require coatings with
broadband reflectivity &gt; 60% and uniform polarization from 90 nm to
2500 nm which can be deposited onto a 2 to 4 to 8 meter mirror
substrate. Additionally, the coatings need to have &gt; 90% reflectivity
 from 450 nm to 2500 nm. Future EUV missions require coatings with
reflectivity &gt; 90% from 6 nm to 200 nm which can be deposited onto
mirror substrates as large as 2.4 meters in diameter.\n\n\n\nSuccessful
proposals will demonstrate an ability to manufacture, test and control
ultra-low-cost precision 0.25 to 0.5 meter optical systems; or to coat a
 0.25 to 0.5 meter representative optical component. Potential solutions
 include, but are not limited to, new mirror materials such as silicon
carbide, nanolaminates or carbon-fiber reinforced polymer; new
fabrication processes such as direct precision machining, rapid optical
fabrication, roller embossing at optical tolerances, slumping or
replication technologies to manufacture 1 to 2 meter (or larger)
precision quality mirrors or lens segments. Solutions include
reflective, transmissive, diffractive or high order diffractive blazed
lens optical components for assembly of large (16 to 32 meter) optical
quality primary elements.\n\n\n\nPotential solutions to improve UV
reflective coatings include, but are not limited to, investigations of
new coating materials with promising UV performance; new deposition
processes; and examination of handling processes, contamination control,
 and safety procedures related to depositing coatings, storing coated
optics, and integrating coated optics into flight hardware. An ability
to demonstrate optical performance on 2 to 3 meter class optical
surfaces is important.\n\n\n\nAn ideal Phase I deliverable would be a
precision mirror of at least 0.25 meters; or a coated mirror of at least
 0.25 meters. An ideal Phase II project would further advance the
technology to produce a space-qualifiable mirror greater than 0.5
meters, with a TRL in the 4 to 5 range. Both Phase I and Phase II
deliverables would be accompanied by all necessary documentation,
including the optical performance assessment and all data on processing
and properties of its substrate materials. The Phase II would also
include a mechanical and thermal stability analysis.",

Center(s):JPL\n\nTerrestrial Balloons \n\n\n\nNASA's Scientific Balloons
 provide practical and cost effective platforms for conducting discovery
 science, development and testing for future space instruments, as well
as training opportunities for future scientists and engineers. Balloons
can reach altitudes above 36 kilometers, with suspended masses up to
3600 kilograms, and can stay afloat for several weeks. Currently, the
Balloon Program is on the verge of introducing an advanced balloon
system that will enable 100 day missions at mid-latitudes and thus
resemble the performance of a small spacecraft at a fraction of the
cost. In support of this development, NASA is seeking innovative
technologies in two key areas:\n\n\n\nPower Storage - Improved devices
to store electrical energy onboard balloon payloads are needed. Long
duration balloon flights can experience 12 hours or more of darkness,
and excess electrical power generated during the day from solar panels
needs to be stored and used. Improvements are needed over the current
state of the art in power density, energy density, overall size, overall
 mass and\/or cost. Typical parameters for balloon are 28 VDC and 100 to
 1000 watts power consumption. Rechargeable batteries are presently used
 for balloon payload applications. Lithium Ion rechargeable batteries
with energy densities of 60 watt-hours per kilogram are the current
state of the art.\n\nSatellite Communications - Improved downlink
bitrates using satellite relay communications from balloon payloads are
needed. Long duration balloon flights currently utilize satellite
communication systems to relay science and operations data from the
balloon to ground based control centers. The current maximum downlink
bit rate is 150 kilobits per second operating continuously during the
balloon flight. Future requirements are for bit rates of 1 megabit per
second or more. Improvements in bit rate performance, reduction in size
and mass of existing systems, or reductions in cost of high bit rate
systems are needed. TDRSS and Iridium satellite communications are
currently used for balloon payload applications. A commercial S-band
TDRSS transceiver and mechanically steered 18 dBi gain antenna provide
150 kbps continuous downlink. TDRSS K-band transceivers are available
but are currently cost prohibitive. Open port Iridium service is under
development, but the operational cost is
prohibitive.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanetary Balloons \n\n\n\nInnovations in
materials, structures, and systems concepts have enabled buoyant
vehicles to play an expanding role in planning NASA's future Solar
System Exploration Program. Balloons are expected to carry scientific
payloads at Titan and Venus that will perform in situ investigations of
their atmospheres and near surface environments. Both Titan and Venus
feature extreme environments that significantly impact the design of
balloons for those two worlds. Proposals are sought in the following
areas:\n\n\n\nSteerable Antenna for Titan and Venus Telecommunications -
 Many concepts for Titan and Venus balloons require high gain antennas
mounted on the balloon gondola to transmit data directly back to Earth.
This approach requires that the antenna remain mechanically or
electronically pointed at the Earth despite the motions experienced
during balloon flight. A beacon signal from the Earth will be available
to facilitate pointing. Innovative concepts are sought for such an
antenna and pointing system with the following characteristics: dish
antenna diameter of 0.8 m (or equivalent non-dish gain), total mass of
antenna and pointing system of = 10 kg, power consumption for the
steering system = 5 W (avg.), pointing accuracy = 0.5 deg (continuous),
hemispheric pointing coverage (2 pi steradians), azimuthal and
rotational slew rates = 30 deg\/sec. It is expected that a Phase I
effort will involve a proof-of-concept experiment leading to a plan for
full scale prototype fabrication and testing in Phase II. Phase II
testing will need to include an Earth atmosphere balloon flight in the
troposphere to evaluate the proposed design under real flight
conditions.\n\nAltitude-Cycling Balloons for Venus - NASA is interested

sophisticated thermal control technology. Innovative proposals for the
cross-cutting thermal control discipline are sought in the following
areas:\n\n\n\nFuture highly integrated electronics for CubeSat\/SmallSat
 will drastically increase the performance per unit volume, mass and
power of electronics systems. High flux heat acquisition and transport
devices are required. In addition, high conductivity, vacuum-compatible
interface materials are needed in order to reduce interface temperature
gradients and facilitate efficient heat removal.\n\nComponents of
advanced small spacecraft such as CubeSat\/SmallSat will have very small
 masses (i.e., small thermal capacitance), and their temperatures are
highly sensitive to variations in the component power output and
spacecraft environmental temperature. Advanced thermal devices capable
of maintaining components within their specified temperature ranges are
needed. Some examples are: \n\nPhase change systems with high thermal
capacity, low volume and low mass for endothermic\/exothermal thermal
management and conditioning. \n\nDurable thermal coatings with low
absorptance, variable emmittance, and good electrical conductivity.
\n\nHigh performance, low cost insulation systems for diverse
environments. \n\nPassive radiator turn-down devices to enable variation
 of heat rejection rates.\n\nAdvanced thermal control systems with
easily adaptable\/reconfigurable thermal management architectures are
needed in order to accommodate multiple heat sources and multiple heat
sinks, particularly a thermal system that can facilitate heat sharing
among on and off components and heat dissipation among multiple
radiators placed on various locations on the spacecraft surface. Also
needed are improved design and analysis tools for rapid design,
integration and testing, and flight operations.\n\nThermal control
systems for long duration operation are needed, including long life
pumps, single-phase and two-phase mechanically pumped fluid systems,
components adaptable to distributed heat acquisition and rejection in
diverse environments such as high radiation doses (Europa, etc.), and
novel heat lift capabilities that enable operation in warm
environments.\n\nAdvanced detectors and optical systems at infrared
wavelengths require efficient cooling methods to low temperatures.
Advanced cryogenic thermal devices for precision temperature measurement
 and control over much larger sensor areas than currently possible are
needed.\n\n\n\nResearch should be conducted to demonstrate technical
feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II hardware
demonstration. Phase II should deliver a demonstration unit for NASA
testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.\n\n\n\nNote to

manipulation, and sampling are needed to enable access to sites of
interest and acquisition and handling of samples for in-situ analysis or
 return to Earth from planetary and solar system small bodies including
Mars, Venus, comets, asteroids, and planetary moons.\n\n\n\nMobility
technologies are needed to enable access to crater walls, canyons,
gullies, sand dunes, and high rock density regions for planetary bodies
where gravity dominates, such as the Moon and Mars. Trafficability
challenges include steep terrain, obstacle size, and low soil cohesion.
Tethered systems, non-wheeled systems, and marsupial systems are
examples of mobility technologies that are of interest. Technologies to
enable mobility on small bodies in micro-gravity environments are also
of interest.\n\n\n\nManipulation technologies are needed to enable
deployment of sampling tools and handling of samples. Mars mission
sample-handling technologies are needed to enable transfer and storage
of a range of rock and regolith cores approximately 1cm long and up to
about 10cm long. Small-body mission manipulation technologies are needed
 to deploy sampling tools to the surface and transfer samples to in-situ
 instruments and sample storage containers.\n\n\n\nSample acquisition
tools are needed to acquire samples on planetary and small bodies. For
Mars, a coring tool is needed to acquire rock and regolith cores
approximately 1cm diameter and up to 10cm long which also supports
transfer of the samples to a sample handling system. Abrading bits for
the tool are needed to provide rock-surface abrasion capability to
better than 0.2mm scale roughness. A deep drill is needed to enable
sample acquisition from the subsurface including rock cores to 3m depth
and icy samples from deeper locations. Tools for sampling from asteroids
 and comets are needed which support transfer of the sample for in-situ
analysis or sample return. Tools for acquisition and transfer of icy
samples on Europa are also of interest. Minimization of mass and ability
 to work reliably in the harsh mission environment are important
characteristics for the tools. Example environmental conditions include
microgravity for small-body missions, high temperature and pressure (460
 0C, 93bar) on Venus, and at Europa the radiation environment is
estimated at 2.9 Mrad total ionizing dose (TID) behind 100 mil thick
aluminum.\n\n\n\nContamination control and planetary protection are
important considerations for sample acquisition and handling
technologies. Contamination may include Earth-source contaminants
produced by the sampling tool, handling system, or deposited on the
sampling location from another source on the rover. "Cleaning to
sterility" technologies are needed that will be compatible with
spacecraft materials and processes. Surface cleaning validation methods
are needed that can be used routinely to quantify trace amounts
(~ng\/cm2) of organic contamination and submicron particle (~100nm size)
 contamination. Priority will be given to cleaning and sterilization
methods that have potential for in-situ applications.\n\n\n\nComponent
technologies for low-mass and low-power systems tolerant to the in-situ
environment are of particular interest. Technical feasibility should be
demonstrated during Phase I and a full capability unit of at least TRL 4
 should be delivered in Phase II. Proposals should show an understanding
 of relevant science needs and engineering constraints and present a
feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA

following:\n\n\n\nSix-axis force-torque sensors for 100g and 35kg
payloads.\n\nSteep terrain adherence.\n\nTether play-out and retrieval

capabilities that enable faster surface traverse.\n\nModular actuators

surface preparation.\n\nSmall body sampling tool.\n\nCleaning to

 to large-scale numerical simulation on supercomputers to advance
understanding of complex Earth and astrophysical systems, and to conduct
 high-fidelity aerospace engineering analyses. The goal of this subtopic
 is to increase the mission impact of NASA's investments in
supercomputing systems and associated operations and services. Specific
objectives are to:\n\n\n\nDecrease the barriers to entry for prospective
 supercomputing users.\n\nMinimize the supercomputer user's total
time-to-solution (e.g., time to discover, understand, predict, or
design).\n\nIncrease the achievable scale and complexity of
computational analysis, data ingest, and data communications.\n\nReduce
the cost of providing a given level of supercomputing performance on
NASA applications.\n\nEnhance the efficiency and effectiveness of NASA's

 improve the productivity of NASA's supercomputing users, broaden NASA's
 supercomputing user base, accelerate advancement of NASA science and
engineering, and benefit the supercomputing community through
dissemination of operational best practices.\n\n\n\nThe approach of this
 subtopic is to seek novel software and hardware technologies that
provide notable benefits to NASA's supercomputing users and facilities,
and to infuse these technologies into NASA supercomputing operations.
Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be
considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, NASA's high-end
computing (HEC) projects - the High End Computing Capability project at
Ames and the Scientific Computing project at Goddard. To assure maximum
relevance to NASA, funded SBIR contracts under this subtopic should
engage in direct interactions with one or both HEC projects, and with
key HEC users where appropriate. Research should be conducted to
demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and
show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration.\n\n\n\nOfferors
should demonstrate awareness of the state-of-the-art of their proposed
technology, and should leverage existing commercial capabilities and
research efforts where appropriate. Open source software and open
standards are strongly preferred. Note that the NASA supercomputing
environment is characterized by: \n\n\n\nHEC systems operating behind a
firewall to meet strict IT security requirements.
\n\nCommunication-intensive applications. \n\nMassive computations
requiring high concurrency. \n\nComplex computational workflows and
immense datasets. \n\nThe need to support hundreds of complex
application codes - many of which are frequently updated by the
user\/developer. \n\n\n\nAs a result, solutions that involve the
following must clearly explain how they would work in the NASA
environment: \n\n\n\nGrid computing. \n\nWeb services. \n\nClient-server
 models. \n\nEmbarrassingly parallel computations. \n\nTechnologies that
 require significant application re-engineering. \n\n\n\nProjects need
not benefit all NASA HEC users or application codes, but demonstrating
applicability to an important NASA discipline, or even a key NASA
application code, could provide significant value.\n\n\n\nSpecific
technology areas of interest:\n\n\n\nEfficient Computing - In spite of
the rapidly increasing capability and efficiency of supercomputers,
NASA's HEC facilities cannot purchase, power, and cool sufficient HEC
resources to satisfy all user demands. This subtopic element seeks
dramatically more efficient and effective supercomputing approaches in
terms of their ability to supply increased HEC capability or capacity
per dollar and\/or per Watt for real NASA applications. Examples
include:\n\nNovel computational accelerators and architectures.\n\nCloud
 supercomputing with high performance interconnects (e.g.,
InfiniBand).\n\nEnhanced visualization technologies.\n\nImproved
algorithms for key codes.\n\nPower-aware "Green" computing technologies
and techniques.\n\nApproaches to effectively manage and utilize
many-core processors including algorithmic changes, compiler techniques
and runtime systems.\n\nUser Productivity Environments - The user
interface to a supercomputer is typically a command line in a text
window. This subtopic element seeks more intuitive, intelligent,
user-customizable, and integrated interfaces to supercomputing
resources, enabling users to more completely leverage the power of HEC
to increase their productivity. Such an interface could enhance many
essential supercomputing tasks: accessing and managing resources,
training, getting services, developing and porting codes (e.g.,
debugging and performance analysis), running computations, managing
files and data, analyzing and visualizing results, transmitting data,
collaborating, etc.\n\nUltra-Scale Computing - Over the next decade, the
 HEC community faces great challenges in enabling its users to
effectively exploit next-generation supercomputers featuring massive
concurrency to the tune of millions of cores. To overcome these
challenges, this subtopic element seeks ultra-scale computing
technologies that enable resiliency\/fault-tolerance in extreme-scale
(unreliable) systems both at job startup and during execution. Also of
interest are system and software co-design methodologies, to achieve
performance and efficiency synergies. Finally, tools are sought that
facilitate verification and validation of ultra-scale applications and
systems.",

 be seamlessly integrated. This subtopic will also create software
components that plug into the framework and open source tools that help
users create new components. The components will provide functionality
ranging from basic operations, such as retrieval of data meeting
user-specified criteria from online repositories and visualization, to
sophisticated data processing and analysis algorithms, such as
atmospheric correction, data fusion, computational model interfaces, and
 machine learning based quality control.\n\n\n\nTo expedite DST
development and deployment by knowledgeable users, this subtopic seeks
an open source graphical workflow tool, similar to Labview or Simulink,
which enables well informed users to quickly create a functional DST
from a catalog of software components. Ultimately, a more sophisticated
graphical workflow development tool, similar to MIT's Scratch would
enforce functionally, but not necessarily logically, "correct by
construction" rules that would enable a broad population of people to
successfully create DSTs. Open source and commercial components, as well
 as services, will be available through an online "store" similar to
iTunes or Google Play.\n\n\n\nThe framework, components and resulting
DSTs should be able to run in a commercial cloud such as Amazon EC2 or
Google Compute Engine. Cloud enabled components and DSTs, those that can
 intelligently take advantage of flexible computing resources for
processing, analysis, visualization, optimization, etc. are highly
desired.\n\n\n\nIdeally, users should be able to create, configure
deploy DSTs, and view outputs such as status, reports, alerts, plots,
maps, etc. via desktop computers (Windows 7 and OS X) as well as tablet
and smart phones running recent versions of Android (4.0 and later) and
iOS (5.0 and later). An HTML5 web application in a standards compliant
browser, such as Chrome, can provide the required level of
interoperability and capability. Due to serious security issues, Java
and Flash based approaches will not be considered.",

Center(s):LaRC,MSFC,KSC,ARC,SSC,JPL\n\nThe size of NASA's observational
data sets is growing dramatically as new missions come on line. In
addition, NASA scientists continue to generate new models that regularly
 produce data sets of hundreds of terabytes or more. It is growing ever
increasingly difficult to manage all of the data through its full
lifecycle, as well as provide effective data analytical methods to
analyze the large amount of data. For example, the HyspIRI mission is
expected to produce an average science data rate of 800 million bits per
 second (Mbps), JPSS-1 will be 300 Mbps and NPP is already producing 300
 Mbps, compared to 150 Mbps for the EOS-Terra, Aqua and Aura missions.
Other examples are SDO with a rate of 150 Mbps and 16.4 Gigabits for a
single image from the HiRise camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
(MRO).\n\n\n\nThis subtopic area seeks innovation and unique approaches
to solve issues associated around the use of "Big Data" within NASA. The
 emphasis of this subtopic is on tools that leverage existing systems,
interfaces, and infrastructure, where it exists and where appropriate.
Reuse of existing NASA assets is strongly
encouraged.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, innovations are being sought in the
following areas:\n\n\n\nParallel Processing for Data Analytics - Open
source tools like the Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) have shown
promise for use in simple MapReduce operations to analyze model and
observation data. In addition to HDFS, there is a rapid emergence and
adoption of cloud software packages integrated with object stores, such
as OpenStack and Swift. The goal is to accelerate these types of open
source tools for use with binary structured data from observations and
model output using MapReduce or a similar paradigm.\n\nHigh Performance
File System Abstractions - NASA scientists currently use a large number
of existing applications for data analysis, such as GrADS, python
scripts, and more, that are not compatible with an object storage
environment. If data were stored within an object storage environment,
these applications would not be able to access the data. Many of these
applications would require a substantial amount of investment to enable
them to use object storage file systems. Therefore, a file system
abstraction, such as FUSE (file system in user space) is needed to
facilitate the use of existing data analysis applications with an object
 storage environment. The goal is to make a FUSE-like file system
abstraction robust, reliable, and highly performing for use with large
NASA data sets.\n\nData Management of Large-Scale Scientific
Repositories - With increasing size of scientific repositories comes an
increasing demand for using the data in ways that may never have been
imagined when the repository was conceived. The goal is to provide
capabilities for the flexible repurposing of scientific data, including
large-scale data integration, aggregation, representation, and
distribution to emerging user communities and applications.\n\nServer
Side Data Processing - Large data repositories make it necessary for
analytical codes to migrate to where the data are stored. Hadoop does
that at the level of a single HDFS. In a densely networked world of
geographically distributed repositories, tiered intermediation is
needed. The goal is to provide support for migratable codes and
analytical outputs as first class objects within a provenance-oriented
data management cyberinfrastructure.\n\nTechniques for Data Analysis and
 Visualization - New methods for data analytics that scale to extremely
large data sets are necessary for data mining, searching, fusion,
subsetting, discovery, visualization, and more. In addition, new
algorithms and methods are needed to look for unknown correlations
across large, distributed scientific data sets. The goal is to increase
the scientific value of model and observation data by making analysis
easier and higher performing. Among others, some of the topics of
interest are:\n\nTechniques for automated derivation of analysis
products such as machine learning for extraction of features in large
image datasets (e.g., volcanic thermal measurement, plume measurement,
automated flood mapping, disturbance mapping, change detection,
etc.).\n\nWorkflows for automated data processing, interpretation, and
distribution.\n\nAccelerated Large Scale Data Movement - There are a
multitude of large distributed data stores across NASA that includes
both observation and model data. The movement of data across the network
 must be optimized to take full advantage of large-scale data analytics,
 especially when comparing model to observation data. The goal is to
optimize data movement in the following ways:\n\nAccelerate and make it
easier to move data over the wide area to facilitate large-scale data
management and analysis.\n\nOptimize the movement of data within more
local environments, such as the usage of Remote Direct Memory Access
(RDMA) within HDFS.\n\nVirtualization of high-speed network interfaces
for use within cloud environments.\n\n\n\nResearch proposed to this
subtopic should demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I, and in
 partnership with scientists, show a path toward a Phase II prototype
demonstration, with significant communication with missions and programs
 to ensure a successful Phase III infusion. It is highly desirable that
the proposed projects lead to software that is infused into NASA
programs and projects.\n\n\n\nTools and products developed under this
subtopic may be used for broad public dissemination or within a narrow
scientific community. These tools can be plug-ins or enhancements to
existing software, on-line data\/computing services, or new stand-alone
applications or web services, provided that they promote
interoperability and use standard protocols, file formats and
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or prevalent applications.",

Center(s):ARC,JPL\n\nNASA seeks innovative systems modeling methods and
tools to:\n\n\n\nDefine, develop and execute future science missions,
many of which are likely to feature designs and operational concepts
that will pose significant challenges to existing approaches and
applications.\n\nEnable disciplined system analysis for the ongoing
management and decision support of the space science technology
portfolio, particularly with regard to understanding technology
alternatives, relationships, priorities, timing, availability,
down-selection, maturation, investment needs, system engineering
considerations, and cost-to-benefit ratios; to examine "what-if"
scenarios; and to facilitate multidisciplinary assessment, coordination,
 and integration of the technology roadmaps as a whole.\n\n\n\nUse of
System Modeling Language (SysML) is encouraged but not required. SysML
is a general purpose graphical modeling language for analyzing,
designing and verifying complex systems that may include hardware,
software, information, personnel, procedures and facilities. As a
language, SysML represents requirements, structure, behavior, and
equations in nine different diagram types, and can represent both
hardware and software models. The language can be extended to provide
metamodels for different disciplines, and is supported by multiple
commercial tools. SysML is finding increased use throughout the agency
to support systems engineering and analysis.\n\n\n\nSpecific areas of
interest include the following:\n\n\n\nIntegration of system and mission
 modeling tools with high-fidelity multidisciplinary design and modeling
 tools, supporting efficient analysis methods that accommodate
uncertainty, multiple objectives, and large-scale systems - This
requires the development of robust interfaces between SysML and other
tools, including CAD\/CAE\/PDM\/PLM applications, used to support NASA
science mission development, implementation and operations. The
objective is to produce a unified environment supporting mixed
systems-level and detailed analysis during any lifecycle phase, and
rapid analysis of widely varying concepts\/configurations using
mixed-fidelity models, including geometry\/mesh-based models when
required. The human interface for such a system could be a "dashboard"
(web-based is highly desirable) which initially allows for monitoring of
 the dataflow across a heterogeneous set of tools and finally allows for
 control of the data flow between the variety of
applications.\n\nModeling and rapid integration of programmatic,
operational, and risk elements - Fully integrated system model
representations must include non-physics based constructs such as cost,
schedule, risk, operations, and organizational model elements. Novel
methods and tools to model these system attributes are critical. In
addition, approaches to integrate these in a meaningful way with other
system model elements are needed. Methods that consider the development
of these models as by-products of a collaborative and\/or concurrent
design process are particularly valuable.\n\nLibrary of SysML models of
NASA related systems - Using a library of SysML models, engineers will
be able to design their systems by reusing a set of existing models. Too
 often, these engineers have to begin from scratch the design of the
systems. A library of verified and validated models would provide a way
for the engineers to design a new spacecraft by assembling existing
models that are domain specific, and therefore easy to adapt to the
target system. In order to provide for seamless integration between
SysML models each model must identify its level of abstraction both in
terms of the modeling of time (progression: no ordering of events,
qualitative ordering of events, metric time ordering of events) and the
modeling of space (progression: lumped parameters models, distributed
parameter models). Such levels of abstraction "certificates" for SysML
will help determine integration interface requirements between any two
models.\n\nProfiles for spacecraft, space robotics, and scientific
instruments - Profiles provide a means of tailoring SysML for particular
 purposes. Extensions of the language can be inserted. This allows an
organization to create domain specific constructs which extend existing
SysML modeling elements. By developing profiles for NASA domains such as
 Spacecraft, Space Robotics and Scientific Instruments, powerful
mechanisms will be available to NASA systems engineers for designing
future space systems.\n\nRequirements Modeling - SysML offers
requirements modeling capabilities, thus providing ways to visualize
important requirements relationships. There is a need to combine
traditional requirements management, supported by tools including but
not limited to DOORS and CRADLE, and SysML requirements modeling in a
standardized and sustainable way.\n\nFunctional Modeling - The
intermediate data products between requirements and specification are
detailed functional models that identify all of the functions required
to achieve the mission profile(s). There is a critical need to model
this layer as it is a key data product to provide traceability between
requirements and implementation.\n\nModel and Modeling Process Synthesis
 - As model-based design broadens and integrates larger and more complex
 models, methods for how to sequence and operate the design synthesis,
evaluation (e.g., V&amp;V) and elaboration process will become more
important, as will considerations of how model-based processes are made
compatible with existing review and development cycles.",

        "description": "Lead Center:MSFCParticipating Center(s):JPL,ARC
\n\nAs science missions are given increasingly complex goals and have
more pressure to reduce operations costs, system autonomy increases.
Fault Management (FM) is one of the key components of system autonomy.
FM consists of the operational mitigations of spacecraft failures. It is
 implemented with spacecraft hardware, on-board autonomous software that
 controls hardware, software, information redundancy, and ground-based
software and operations procedures.\n\n\n\nMany recent Science Mission
Directorate (SMD) missions have encountered major cost overruns and
schedule slips during test and verification of FM functions. These
overruns are due to a lack of understanding of FM functions early in the
 mission definition cycles and to FM architectures that do not provide
attributes of transparency, verifiability, fault isolation capability,
or fault coverage. The NASA FM Handbook is under development to improve
the FM design, development, verification and validation and operations
processes. FM approaches, architectures, and tools are needed to improve
 early understanding of needed FM capabilities by project managers and
FM engineers and to improve the efficiency of implementing and testing
FM.\n\n\n\nSpecific objectives are to:\n\n\n\nImprove the ability to
predict FM system complexity and estimate development and operations
costs.\n\nEnable cost-effective FM design architectures and
operations.\n\nDetermine completeness and appropriateness of FM designs
and implementations.\n\nDecrease the labor and time required to develop
and test FM models and algorithms.\n\nImprove visualization of the full
FM design across hardware, software, and operations
procedures.\n\nDetermine extent of testing required, completeness of
verification planned, and residual risk resulting from incomplete
coverage.\n\nIncrease data integrity between multi-discipline
tools.\n\nStandardize metrics and calculations across FM, SE, S&amp;MA
and operations disciplines.\n\nIncrease reliability of FM
systems.\n\n\n\nExpected outcomes are better estimation and control of
FM complexity and development costs, improved FM designs, and
accelerated advancement of FM tools and techniques.\n\n\n\nThe approach
of this subtopic is to seek the right balance between sufficient
reliability and cost appropriate to the mission type and risk posture.
Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be
considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, SMD missions.
Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and
NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II
prototype demonstration.\n\n\n\nOfferors should demonstrate awareness of
 the state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage
existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where
appropriate.\n\n\n\nSpecific technology in the forms listed below is
needed to increase delivery of high quality FM systems. These
approaches, architectures and tools must be consistent with and enable
the NASA FM Handbook concepts and processes:\n\n\n\nFM Design Tools -
System modeling and analyses significantly contributes to the quality of
 FM design; however, the time it takes to translate system design
information into system models often decreases the value of the modeling
 and analysis results. Examples of enabling techniques and tools are
modeling automation, spacecraft modeling libraries, expedited algorithm
development, sensor placement analyses, and system model tool
integration.\n\nFM Visualization Tools - FM systems incorporate
hardware, software, and operations mechanisms. The ability to visualize
the full FM system and the contribution of each mechanism to protecting
mission functions and assets is critical to assessing the completeness
and appropriateness of the FM design to the mission attributes (mission
type, risk posture, operations concept, etc.). Fault trees and state
transition diagrams are examples of visualization tools that could
contribute to visualization of the full FM design.\n\nFM Verification
and Validation Tools - As complexity of spacecraft and systems
increases, the extensiveness of testing required to verify and validate
FM implementations can be resource intensive. Automated test case
development, false positive\/false negative test tools, model
verification and validation tools, and test coverage risk assessments
are examples of contributing technologies.\n\nFM Design Architectures -
FM capabilities may be implemented through numerous system, hardware,
and software architecture solutions. The FM architecture trade space
includes options such as embedded in the flight control software or
independent onboard software; on board versus ground-based capabilities;
 centralized or distributed FM functions; sensor suite implications;
integration of multiple FM techniques; innovative software FM
architectures implemented on flight processors or on Field Programmable
Gate Arrays (FPGAs); and execution in real-time or off-line analysis
post-operations. Alternative architecture choices could help control FM
system complexity and cost and could offer solutions to transparency,
verifiability, and completeness challenges.\n\nMulti-discipline FM
Interoperation - FM designers, Systems Engineering, Safety and Mission
Assurance, and Operations perform analyses and assessments of
reliabilities, failure modes and effects, sensor coverage, failure
probabilities, anomaly detection and response, contingency operations,
etc. The relationships between multi-discipline data and analyses are
inconsistent and misinterpreted. Resources are expended either in effort
 to resolve disconnects in data and analyses or worse, reduced mission
success due to failure modes that were overlooked. Solutions that
address data integrity, identification of metrics, and standardization
of data products, techniques and analyses will reduce cost and
failures.",

        "description": "Lead Center:JPLParticipating
Center(s):GSFC\n\nTwo of the key challenges for microwave remote sensing
 (active and passive) of the Earth's environment are: \n\n\n\nObtaining
measurements of sufficiently high resolution such that in-pixel
averaging affects do not introduce errors or otherwise obscure the
phenomena being measured. \n\nProviding wide-area coverage such large
scale systems can be studied synoptically and revisit times are
sufficiently small to study phenomena with relatively rapid
changes.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, both are generally at odds with each
other. For traditional fixed-beam antenna systems, improvement of
resolution necessarily leads to a reduction in coverage. In order to
achieve desired coverage and resolution array antenna and sensor
technologies can be employed. This may take different forms, depending
upon the application. For radar systems, active, electronically-steered
phased arrays can provide beam agility that can be used to cover wide
swaths with high resolution and can also be used to dynamically target
phenomena of interest, maximizing the value of sampling time and
on-orbit assets. For passive remote sensors, highly-thinned correlating
radiometer arrays can provide high spatial resolutions over a wide areas
 and focal-plane arrays can be used to bring camera-like properties
usually associated with visible-light and IR measurements to
sub-millimeter wavelengths.\n\n\n\nThe range of techniques described
above will enhance and enable a variety of important Earth science
measurements including: Surface deformations (volcanos, fault motion,
subsidence), ice sheet thickness and dynamics, atmospheric phenomena
such as precipitation, clouds and atmospheric water vapor.\n\n\n\nThe
specific technologies solicited are:\n\n\n\nKu\/Ka-band
electronically-scanned linear arrays - The impacts of clouds and
precipitation represent some of the greatest uncertainties in current
climate models. The complex interactions in cloud and precipitation
systems dictate that they be studied as a whole, whereas previous
mission have only been able to study clouds and precipitation
separately. To study the complete system at the appropriate spatial
scales with adequate resolution requires simultaneous scanning array
technology at a range of microwave and millimeter-wave
wavelengths.\n\nFrequencies (simultaneous): 13.4, 35.6, 94 GHz\n\nArray
element spacing (typ.): 0.65 wavelengths\n\nTransmit power per element

consistent with state-of-the-art\n\nFront-end losses as low as
possible\n\nManufacturing scalable to 2-3 m long arrays.\n\nLow
Frequency RF Tomography Technology for Global Biomass and Ice Sheet
Investigations - Global biomass and ice sheet investigations require a
simple space borne low frequency (100-500 MHz) multi-channel altimeter
that can measure 3-D tomography images of the Earth above ground biomass
 and ice sheet thickness. Doppler beam sharpening (SAR processing) will
be used to obtain high spatial resolution along the track and
multi-channel altimeters along the cross track will be used for
obtaining high resolution in the cross track direction.\n\n\n\nPhase I
Studies Requirements:\n\n\n\nDesign and feasibility study of low
frequency array antenna mounted along the wings of NASAs P3 like
aircraft. Design must satisfy both electromagnetic and aerodynamic
performances. Frequency of operation: 300 MHz, Bandwidth 50 MHz,
Linear\/Dual polarized.\n\nDesign of RF front end and base band
processing units for each altimeter channel that are phase locked with
each other.\n\nFeasibility study of using multi-channel altimeter for
3-D tomography imaging of biomass and ice sheets through simulated
data.\n\n\n\nPhase II Studies Requirements:\n\n\n\nHardware realization
of design completed in Phase I studies.\n\nIntegration of antenna and
other electronics with the selected aircraft (need not be NASAs
P3).\n\nField campaign to advance technology to TRL 6.\n\nP-, L-band
Array Antennas:\n\nInnovative designs for deployable lightweight antenna
 arrays for airborne and space borne SAR applications are required. The
array designs should meet flatness requirements, minimize stowed volumes
 and provide robust deployment mechanisms. The array RF performance
should support &lt; 20% bandwidth, dual-polarization, high polarization
isolation (&gt; 30 dB) phased array radar applications. The use of
composite materials that can reduce the antenna weight and maintain
surface flatness is desirable.\n\nLow Power Digital Correlator Systems
for Synthetic Aperture Arrays:\n\nCurrently this is the key required
element for the array on PATH. Several technology programs are under
way, but a working, high TRL system is not yet available.\n\n\n\nPhase I
 - Design and feasibility study of crosscorrelators with 2-bit
resolution operating at 1 GHz clock speed. This includes the
digitization and digital crosscorrelation functionality for correlation
of 3x128 I-Q receiver outputs from three arms of the
instrument.\n\n\n\nPower consumption is a major driver for the system,
most likely only to be achieved by using ASIC chips. The correlator
design will include housing and thermal design to demonstrate
feasibility for operation in vacuum.\n\n\n\nPhase II - Implementation
and testing of the correlator system. This includes desing, manufacture
and functional and thermal testing of the correlator system. Testing of
the system in a interferometer system, such as JPL GeoSTAR testbed will
demonstrate the performance in a real instrument.",

Instrumentation",
        "description": "Lead Center:GSFCParticipating
Center(s):JPL\n\nIn astrophysics, science instruments are "photon
starved". Every photon has to count. Efficient use of light and
maximizing signal-to-noise is critical and there is always room for
improvement. In many high-resolution spectroscopy systems as much as 50%
 of the light is lost in the spectrometer optics before it gets to the
detectors. It is far more cost-efficient to improve detection systems in
 terms of throughput, efficiency, resolution, and noise than to
compensate by making the payload larger. Spectroscopy is applicable in
the UV, visible, IR. In terms of instrumentation, answers to higher
photon efficiency can be answered through entire novel instrument
(system designs) to single components (filters, grisms, gratings,
etc.)\n\n\n\nTransit Spectroscopy, multi-object spectrographs, slit and
slit-less spectrographs and associated component and subsystem
technologies such as grisms, filters, etalons, etc. enable higher
performance and more efficient use of the light collected.
High-resolution spectroscopy for galaxy evolution, exoplanet
spectroscopy for deciphering the chemical composition of exoplanetary
atmospheres. High resolution spectroscopy in UV, Visible, and
IR.\n\n\n\nSpecific areas of research include:\n\n\n\nImage slicers.
Imager slicers are stacks of optics that `slice' a field into separate
regions and remap them into a pseudo-slit (or slits) that are then fed
into a traditional spectrograph. This design can be used to produce an
efficient imaging spectrograph that has a high fill factor. Micromirror
and lenslet-based integral field spectrographs have a very low fill
factor by comparison (less efficient use of pixels by a factor of
4).\n\nMicromirror arrays. Micromirror arrays work similarly to lenslet
arrays in that they compress the light from a single spatial location
into a focused spot. UV wavelengths however require micromirror arrays
because refractive optics will not work. In addition, micromirror arrays
 can operate over broad bandpasses without producing chromatic
aberrations.\n\nImproved dichroic filters. Dichroic filters reflect a
certain bandpass and transmit another wavelength. Improved dichroic
filters would enable more efficient use of separate science instruments
or a single multi-band imaging instrument.\n\nLenslet-coupled fiber
optics for space flight. Fiber-fed lenslet arrays could also be used to
produce a pseudo-slit in a similar way to the image slicers. The
fiber-coupling losses and problems with packing the fibers closely due
to the cladding have precluded their use.\n\nImproved Fabry Perot
etalons. Fabry Perot etalons are some of the highest resolution
spectrometers that are used for instrumentation but they suffer from
high loss and large size that make them difficult to implement for
space. Improvements in size and efficiency are sought for Fabry Perot
etalons.\n\nImproved gratings.\n\nOn chip hyperspectral imaging systems.
 Hyperspectral imaging is an area of continued interest in particular to
 Earth Science for applications such as agriculture and land use. These
systems tend to be complex and difficult to implement. Approaches to
integrate the hyperspectral filtering with the detector are sought.",

        "description": "Lead Center:GSFCParticipating
Center(s):JPL,MSFC\n\nAmbitious science goals along with budgetary
constraints are driving the need to increase the science return from
smaller mission classes. This has led to new interest in cubesats and
smallsats as viable science platforms. To enable capable science with
these smaller missions, there is a critical need to miniaturize
instruments, as well as spacecraft subsystems. To this end, this
subtopic solicits the development of a radiation hardened
structured-ASIC platform to implement flexible instrument processing
nodes. This technology would enable integration of all digital functions
 of an instrument onto a single device, and would also enable similar
integration of spacecraft bus digital functions for a cubesat or a
smallsat.\n\n\n\nAs flexible instrument processing nodes would reduce
board-level assemblies into individual integrated circuits, the overall
size\/mass\/power savings provided to a mission would be dramatic. A
sampling of candidate mission applications for this technology
includes:\n\n\n\nMiniaturized planetary instruments such as
magnetometers and imagers. \n\nHighly capable heliophysics cubesats
along with miniaturized instruments to measure field and particles.
\n\nEarth observing smallsats and miniaturized instruments. \n\nLow
power channel readout electronics for astrophysics mission concepts
require data acquisition and processing for hundreds or even thousands
of individual channels. \n\n\n\nIf broadly applied, the flexible
instrument processing nodes may enable currently roadmapped science
observations to be implemented in smaller mission classes than are
currently planned.\n\n\n\nTo effectively support this broad array of
applications, it is imperative that flexible instrument processing nodes
 be implemented such that customization for specific instruments and
missions is both rapid and economical. Historically, the high cost and
long development schedule of spaceflight ASICs has largely precluded
them from use for mission specific applications. However, the emergence
of radiation hardened structured-ASICs has the potential to change this
paradigm, and as such, this is the specified platform for the flexible
instrument processing node.\n\n\n\nThis processing node will require an
aggressive adoption of System-On-a-Chip (SOC) technology, which will
provide substantially more resources than are presently available.
Target specifications for the platform are; embedded 32-bit processor,
50,000 logic cells, 4Mbit of embedded RAM, 500kbit embedded ROM, and 400
 user I\/O. While dependent on the user design, maximum clock rates of
at least 200MHz and maximum power dissipation of less than 500mW are
desirable. As previously stated, it is desired that the node be
implemented as a high capacity radiation hardened structured-ASIC
platform that can enable highly integrated, instrument specific device
implementations, while offering up to a 10x reduction in development
cost and schedule as compared to full custom ASICs. Environmental
specifications are; radiation hard to at least 1 Mrad TID, latch up
Immune to an LET of at least 80, and a device SEE rate of not greater
than 0.01 event\/day in Adams 90% worst case GEO environment. For
descriptions of radiation effects in electronics, the proposer may visit

(http:\/\/radhome.gsfc.nasa.gov\/radhome\/background.htm).\n\n\n\nProposals
 should clearly describe:\n\n\n\nThe top-level device
architecture.\n\nIndividual circuit elements.\n\nThe routing scheme.
\n\nMethodologies for radiation hardening. \n\nOverall device capacity.
\n\nExpected performance and power dissipation. \n\nFabrication process
and mask programming steps.\n\nSoftware tool flow for user designs.
\n\n\n\nSuccessful proposal concepts should significantly advance the
state-of-the-art. If a Phase II proposal is awarded, the combined Phase I
 and Phase II developments should produce prototype devices that can be
evaluated by NASA.\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that NASA can sponsor
fabrication via the Trusted Access Program Office (TAPO) for this
effort.",

Small spacecraft, on the cubesat scale, could potentially perform
science and exploration missions of great interest to NASA at a very low
 cost. Small spacecraft in deep space might also provide support
services for other spacecraft and operations such as communications
relays or space weather sensors.\n\n\n\nNASA expects that there will be
opportunities to fly several 6U cubesat spacecraft as secondary payloads
 on launch vehicles that could deploy these payloads on Earth escape
trajectories that would take them past the Moon. One specific
possibility for such an opportunity for small secondary spacecraft
deployments is the first test flight of the Space Launch System (EM-1).
EM-1 or similar missions would provide an excellent opportunity for

technologies on a cubesat (6U or smaller) in the 2017 timeframe. The
flight demonstration should include mission objectives that are relevant
 to a deep space mission such as remote sensing or in situ science data
collection activities. The development of an appropriate propulsion
system to enable maneuvers such as lunar orbit insertion is also of

 of this deep space cubesat technology demonstrator should employ mature

 the definition and initial development of the needed technologies for a
 deep space cubesat technology demonstrator. In Phase II, the
technologies should be further developed and demonstrated in relevant

systems have been incorporated into disturbance reduction systems to
demonstrate that a solid body can float freely in space completely
undisturbed in order to explore the gravitational universe.&amp;nbsp;

end, this solicitation seeks to mature and demonstrate iodine electric

        "topic_name": "Reducing the Burden on Military Tactical Networks
 by Lowering the Impact of Digital Medical Image Transmissions",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Seek methodologies and emerging
technologies to reduce the burden on the military"s tactical networks
derived from the transmission of digital medical imagery.
DESCRIPTION: Recent military conflicts and humanitarian relief
operations have placed new demands on healthcare providers in terms of
providing medical diagnoses for injuries from remote locations as part
of an ever-expanding telemedicine program supporting our Operational
Medicine missions. Additionally, as new digital modalities are added to
the force structure supporting medical Roles of Care 1-3, the medical
impact on the tactical network architecture and throughput has called
into question its ability to support a modern deployed healthcare system
 which is heavily reliant on digital imagery and telemedicine
technologies. While the military"s communication communities and
associated acquisition programs struggle to keep up with demand for
bandwidth support to the Operational Force, the military medical
communities must place equal emphasis on reducing their throughput
requirements in order to ensure a robust and successful telemedicine
program. Imaging technologies such as CT, US and XRAY can enable
clinical decision making without unnecessary medical evacuation to
higher Roles of Care, where a broader range of in-person expertise will
be available.    Telemedicine and Teleconsultation face several
challenges in the Operational Medicine environment:     The first
challenge lies in the finite limitations of the tactical networks
supporting Roles of Care 1-3 and the competition for those networks by
numerous bandwidth hungry military communities. Digital medical image
file sizes can be relatively large in their current state of commercial
availability and place burdens on the tactical networks that have the
potential of putting other military communities at risk of mission
failure. This fact reduces the warfighter"s prioritization of medical
data transmissions and jeopardizes the medical community"s ability of
guaranteeing a robust telemedicine capability. Since the tactical
networks are a shared resource amongst all Operational military
communities, any effort to reduce the medical burden on those networks
will subsequently increase the likelihood of guaranteeing a successful
telemedicine program. Therefore, the major goal of this SBIR is to
research ways to reduce the medical burden on the military"s tactical
networks through a variety of means outlined earlier.     The second
challenge is that the military"s tactical networks are a compilation of
various technologies ranging from data-sharing tactical radios to
satellite transmissions depending on where the medical unit is arrayed
on the battlefield. Beyond the varying network modalities across the
Operational space, networks can be further divided between high-side
(secure) and low-side (unsecure) transmissions. All of these factors
become impeding factors to ensuring a robust telemedicine capability and
 must be accounted for in this research proposal.    Proposed methods,
network policies, and technological solutions must be able to work with
multiple vendors of existing image management products. Any new
algorithms for improved compression of digital images should improve
upon the current state-of-the-art for lossy and lossless technologies,
which depending upon the type of image, is currently at 30:1 for some
image file formats. New proposed technology compression algorithms must
still ensure diagnostic image quality. The government is particularly
interested in new entropic compression algorithms. Additionally,
solutions should provide for secure and\/or anonymized data transfer of
medical images. Lastly, solutions should support best medical practices
for military Operational Medicine across a variety of missions including
 full-spectrum, sustainment, low intensity conflict (LIC) and
humanitarian relief.    Applicants should be knowledgeable about other
existing Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
standards (http:\/\/medical.nema.org\/), and related efforts to improve
image management processes and exchange, such as those promoted by the
Health Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Integrated Health
Environment (IHE) Profiles (http:\/\/www.ihe.net\/). Likewise, the
American College of Radiology is engaged in clinical research
(http:\/\/www.acr.org\/Research\/ClinicalResearch).    Applicants should
 also consider past work on image management use cases set-forth by the
Healthcare IT Standards Panel (HITSP) work initiated by the Department
of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Office of the National Coordinator
for Healthcare Information Technology (C-41, IS-107, CAP-00, CAP-129,
TP-49, TP-89, TN-905, RDSS-59, among others). Additionally, the awardees
 should consider the applicability of the NwHIN
(http:\/\/www.healthit.gov\/policy-researchers-implementers\/nationwide-health-information-network-nwhin)
 Standards and Interoperability Framework
(http:\/\/www.siframework.org\/implementation.html); NwHIN CONNECT
(http:\/\/www.connectopensource.org\/) and DIRECT
(http:\/\/wiki.directproject.org\/) in designing the architecture. These
 constructs are now being http:\/\/wiki.directproject.org\/
operationalized through a new public\/private consortium known as
Healtheway, Inc. (http:\/\/healthewayinc.org\/).    The government
realizes that this research may invent novel concepts and technologies
not yet considered in existing standards. Given this potentiality, U.S.
Army TATRC will make a best attempt effort, with the concurrence of the
offeror, to introduce the new technology to existing standards group for
 evaluation and possible adoption as a new standard.    PHASE I: Phase I
 proposals should develop a conceptual framework of new methods or
technologies aimed at reducing the medical impact on military tactical
networks New methods or technologies must enable the remote diagnosis of
 visual, CT, US and XRAY images. Other clinical imaging modalities are
desirable, but not necessary at this time. New methods or technologies
are expected to be compatible with existing vendor image hardware
solutions, which typically require use of DICOM standards. Proposed
solutions must address the following key technical features: (1)
functional data compression technology ideally greater than 30:1 for all
 modalities and image types, while retaining diagnostic quality; (2) a
strategy for secure and\/or anonymized data transfer of medical images
and (3) a software routine and strategy by which
telemedicine\/teleconsultation can be performed using portable devices.
    PHASE II: Phase II efforts would be directed at taking the
conceptual framework developed in Phase I, and developing a prototype
technology solution that combines all of the desired features from Phase
 I. Phase II applicants must demonstrate that the technology can offer
high levels of sensitivity and specificity for militarily-relevant
injuries as it pertains to (1) data compression and (2) telemedicine and
 teleconsultation on portable devices. Offerors must also conduct robust
 testing to demonstrate interoperability with hardware imaging solutions
 from multiple vendors, using either a real physical environment, or
virtual simulation. Phase II proposal submission offerors must
demonstrate how they will obtain FDA approvals ahead of
commercialization of the technology, and should be cognizant of the new
FDA regulations on medical mobile devices. It is anticipated that human
data will be used for validation, and members of the radiological
community will participate as part of the Phase II team.    PHASE III
DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Medicine in austere environments occurs beyond
the battlefield. New methods and technologies would be of benefit to
support goodwill, humanitarian disaster relief medical efforts that
require state-of-the-art telemedicine capabilities. Equally important,
such technologies could enhance the capabilities of first responders
since they will be able to interact with physicians or other medical
experts at the scene of the incident before arrival at the point of
care.",

        "topic_name": "Computer-Generated, Synthetic Medical Images and
Complex Narratives for Use in Healthcare Informatics Research",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: As a first objective, conduct basic
and applied research surrounding new technologies to computer-generate
completely synthetic, complex, medical text narratives for subsequent
use in clinical informatics research and healthcare information
technology feasibility studies. As a second objective, conduct basic and
 applied research surrounding new technologies to computer-generate
completely synthetic medical images for subsequent use in clinical
informatics research and healthcare information technology feasibility
studies.  If the research is successful, computer-generated synthetic
medical text and images could then be made available to the government
and\/or other private researchers through commercial or open source
licensing agreements.       DESCRIPTION: What is the problem?
Medical research studies, particularly those involving medical
informatics or health care information technology evaluations, are
hampered by the lack of available, timely, high quality structured,
unstructured, and imaging data. Similar research studies conducted by
academia and private industry labs face the same challenge.
Acquiring such data from Military Health System Automated Systems of
Record, Commercial Electronic Health Record (EHR), or Clinical\/Business
 Intelligence systems is a timely process.  It typically requires:  (1)
obtaining permission from research subjects, (2) submission of detailed
Human Subjects Research Protection protocols, (3) First and Second Level
 Institutional Review Boards (IRB) Approval, (4) obtaining Data Use
Agreements, (5) Privacy Board Approval, and (6) hiring experts to pull
and de-identify or anonymize electronic health records data. This
process can typically take up to a year to complete.     Even if real
data became available in a timely fashion, there is always the chance
that it would not be completely de-identified or anonymized.  This is
particularly true in the case of complex patient histories containing
medical text narratives that may mention familial relationships or other
 unique facts that could be pieced together to identify the patient.
De-identification and\/or anonymization is typically conducted through
computer-algorithms that are not 100 percent trust-worthy.  Even in the
case of additional human review after computer-assisted
de-identification or anonymization, complete de-identification and\/or
anonymization cannot be guaranteed.  Human review is typically limited
by available resources to read large amounts of patient histories, and
is generally not available for research data sets involving thousands of
 records.  These constraints pose additional challenges and risks
involving protecting patient privacy as required by HIPAA and Human
Subjects"Review.  Data breaches can lead to patient medical and
financial identity theft, public relations concerns, and subsequent
class action law suits.     Obtaining imaging data is also difficult.
As one researcher indicates,"The collection of medical image data for
research can be an expensive time consuming task. Positron emission
tomography (PET), x-ray computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance
 imaging (MRI) systems can easily cost over a million dollars. They may
require dedicated staff, maintenance contracts, and access to expensive
supporting equipment such as a cyclotron. In addition, collection of
data for large studies may take months. The process is complicated by
equipment schedules, organization of volunteers\/subjects, use of
potentially harmful electromagnetic radiation, radiopharmaceuticals, and
 contrast agents, as well as patient privacy rights. These difficulties
limit the availability of clinical data, especially for smaller academic
 research programs. Creating software models of the human anatomy and
imaging systems, and modeling the medical physics of the imaging
acquisition process can provide a means to generate realistic synthetic
data sets. In many cases synthetic data sets can be used, reducing the
time and cost of collecting real images, and making data sets available
to institutions without clinical imaging systems."In the envisioned
ideal state, medical research studies could be expedited if synthetic
medical text narrative data and images could be computer-generated.
Having synthetic data would forgo the need for IRB and DUA approvals
because the data would be completely made up, and have absolutely no
ties to any real patient records.  Furthermore, there would be no chance
 of HIPAA violations, patient medical or financial identity theft,
public relations concerns, or any class-action law suits.    Why is it
hard?     Automatically generating synthetic health data is not trivial.
     Healthcare data is complex and synthetically generating such
different types of data may require different technologies which arise
from artificial intelligence work.  For example, Semi-structured or free
 text clinical narratives can contain:    A clinician"s free text or
semi-structured assessment of the patient"s history, probable diagnosis,
 and recommended procedures:     radiology text reports   pathology text
 reports   operation text reports    discharge narrative summaries
medical boards and disability profiles     Such unstructured and
semi-structured data could contain:     complex demographic information
regarding the patient and those whom he\/she interacts   multiple
diagnosis or problems and their progression over time   patient and
family proteomic and genomic history   patient exposures to major trauma
 and related procedures   patient environmental or toxin exposures
patient nutrition, exercise, and sleep data    key social and life
events over time that impact health status    Imaging data is also
complex and may include radiographs, MRI studies, CT scans, cardiology,
nuclear medicine, and ultrasound studies, to name a few.    In order to
use such synthetically generated data in subsequent clinical research
studies or healthcare IT proof of concept evaluations, it must be valid,
 reliable, complete, timely, and clinically-relevant over the life of a
patient.  Determining whether the synthetically-generated data is of
sufficient quality for use in subsequent clinical research requires
extensive human testing and review. In lieu of obtaining such real data
for validation of synthetic data, the synthetically generated computer
data would be validated solely by human subject matter expertise and
knowledge of the real data.  The research use case for the data would
dictate what quality of synthetic data would be acceptable for use.  For
 example, basic healthcare IT system functional testing and feasibility
studies may be able to be validated with lesser quality synthetic data
than which might be required for validating population health studies,
which would require very high quality synthetic data.    There would be
additional challenges to ingesting such synthetic data into healthcare
information technology development and testing environments, as
government and commercial EHRs use different underlying logical and
physical data models.  Ideally, synthetically generated data should in a
 format capable of ingestion into an electronic health record, and
should consider the various standard component formats (C.XX), specified
 by the Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP), and
the Continuity of Care Record (CCR) and Clinical Document Architecture
(CDA) standards, or even new efforts such as HL-7 FHIR, or the OMG
Clinical Information Modeling Initiative backed by Mayo Clinic and
Intermountain Healthcare.  DICOM standards would apply to imaging
studies.    Research in this field is somewhat hampered by the number of
 qualified artificial intelligence individuals available, although there
 is promising research underway with respect to generating synthetic
medical data.    How is it solved today?      There are very few
open-source or commercial synthetic medical data sets available today
for use in clinical research.  Available synthetic data sets are limited
 to very specific purposes.  Most importantly, there are no known large,
 general purpose, complete sets of synthetic medical narrative text and
imaging data that can be incorporated into EHRs for use clinical
informatics studies or healthcare information technology feasibility
studies, although some research has started in this regard.    NIH did
release an initial Observational Medical Dataset Simulator (OSIM1) in
2009 which was used to generate datasets with millions of hypothetical
patients with drug exposure, background conditions, and known adverse
events for the purpose of benchmarking methods performance. Continued
research has resulted in the development of a second-generation
simulated dataset procedure, known as OSIM2. OSIM2 represents an
alternative design to accommodate additional complexities observed in
real-world data, including advanced modeling of the correlations between
 drugs and conditions. OSIM2 allows for more direct comparisons between
simulated data and real observational databases, and should enable
greater methods evaluation by allowing assessment of how methods
accommodate these complex interrelationships.       Anna L Buczak,1
Steven Babin,1 and Linda Moniz report in BioMedical Central a novel
methodology for"generating complete synthetic EMRs both for an outbreak
illness of interest (tularemia) and for background records. The method
developed has three major steps: 1) synthetic patient identity and basic
 information generation; 2) identification of care patterns that the
synthetic patients would receive based on the information present in
real EMR data for similar health problems; 3) adaptation of these care
patterns to the synthetic patient population". The research did generate
 EMRs, including visit records, clinical activity, laboratory
orders\/results and radiology orders\/results, but it was limited to
only 203 synthetic tularemia outbreak patients.    Lombardo and Moniz
report on a similar method for generating synthetic data to study
disease outbreaks.      The Partners healthcare i2b2 challenge has made
available several public data sets for Natural Language Processing
Studies.     The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command,
Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC), through
its contracted partners, is generating some structured electronic health
 record data such as patient demographics; lab, pharmacy, and radiology
order and results; and disease and procedure codes. This research effort
 is also auto-generating very simple patient histories consisting of
several lines of text notating that a patient may have presented for a
clinical encounter or admission or has history of a particular disease
or procedure, but these short narratives are insufficient for natural
language processing studies and other clinical informatics studies.
 The government is aware of ongoing efforts to synthetically generate
business intelligence stories and sports stories. Other research efforts
 are underway in the Netherlands to create compelling, entertaining, and
 believable stories by focusing on plot creation, discourse generation
and spoken language presentation. There are numerous web sites emerging
which can generate children"s stories. The underlying technologies might
 be applied to generating free or semi-structured medical text.  The
exact technologies employed are unknown and may be proprietary but most
likely center around use of Latent Semantic Analysis to generate
synthetic text narrative data.     Some research underway to apply
computer graphics technologies to create entertainment movies and even
virtual worlds, which might be now applied to generating synthetic
medical images.  Some research involving synthetic medical image
generation is underway by academic institutions and companies in the
Rochester, NY area, which is major worldwide center of image excellence.
  The exact techniques employed by these efforts are unknown, although
some research may be building upon the generation of synthetic data
involving earth geographic sensor data  .     Proposed Solution
Summary:    The need for synthetic data for use in clinical research and
 healthcare IT feasibility studies is well documented.  This SBIR topic
is intended to build upon the aforementioned research efforts to
generate complex, story-like, unstructured or semi-structured electronic
 healthcare data for use in medical research. In addition, the research
will develop toolsets to generate synthetic digital images (XRAY, CT,
MRI, Ultrasound, Pathology and Dermatology), using Computer-Generated
Imagery.  The government is interested in evaluating innovative
proposals outlining various approaches to generating such synthetic
imaging and complex text narratives, which either build upon existing
approaches, or are entirely new approaches. Such synthetic data must be
generated in a way that does not rely on any form of past data that was
real, de-identified, or anonymized patient medical data, and should be
derived"ab-initio". The research should also include novel methods to
compare the validity of the synthetic data to real data, for use in
clinical informatics research and health information technology
feasibility studies.    Boundaries to Consider:    The quality of the
synthetic data to be generated will be dictated by the current clinical
informatics research and healthcare information technology feasibility
studies underway, some of which are known, and some of which will be
determined by higher authority closer to award.  The government will
negotiate this aspect with the vendor.    Synthetically generated data
should in a format capable of ingestion into an electronic health
record, and should consider the various standard component formats
(C.XX), specified by the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for
Healthcare Information Technology, the past work of the Healthcare
Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP), and the Continuity of
Care Record (CCR) and Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) standards,
and associated HL-7 FHIR and OMG Clinical Information Modeling
Initiatives.  DICOM standards apply to imaging studies.    Once
generated based on certain characteristics, the applied research should
aim to find ways to effectively ingest such data into existing
healthcare information technology evaluation platforms, such as the
TATRC Early Stage Platform for subsequent use in healthcare IT prototype
 and risk reduction activities, under an appropriate licensing
agreement.  As a matter of background the TATRC Early Stage Platform
provides a virtualized development and test environment containing
current DOD electronic health record components (AHLTA, CHCS and
Essentris in the future), which can then be used to support third party
application development and other government funded clinical informatics
 research projects awarded to other government research recipients.
PHASE I: In Phase I, the offeror will outline the various technical
approaches which exist for developing high quality synthetic medical
images and complex narrative texts, which can then be used in clinical
informatics research and health information technology studies.  During
Phase I, the vendor will work with the Government to understand the
various clinical informatics and health IT research underway, for which
the synthetic data is to be used. This will guide further decisions
regarding the quality of the data which is to be generated.  Phase I
will be largely centered on whether it is even technically feasible to
generate the complex narrative medical text necessary for use in
clinical informatics research given the current state of artificial
intelligence research.  At the end of Phase I, the government will need
to get a sense of whether it should even proceed with Phase II.
Therefore, it is important that the offeror provide a final report that
presents the relative advantages, disadvantages, and tradeoffs of each
technical approach for generating synthetic data, and how each approach
builds upon past knowledge concerning synthetic generation of data, and
addresses current gaps. The offeror may propose how it would improve
upon existing approaches, or develop entirely new approaches to generate
 synthetic medical images and complex narrative medical text.      It is
 also important to note that Phase I will extend beyond this tradeoff
analysis.  The offeror will also work with the government to develop use
 cases and configuration parameters surrounding the generation of
synthetic data, which can demonstrate the feasibility of commercializing
 such technology and\/or applying it in military medical research
settings.  As part of Phase I, the offeror will develop evaluation
criteria to judge the quality of the imaging and narrative free or
semi-structured text data for use in research, based on the use cases
envisioned.  Research would also center around gaining an understanding
of the complexities of generating such data for potential ingestion into
 the U.S. Army Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center
Early Stage Platform, or other similar government lab platform, which
will include the DOD Electronic Health Record (currently AHLTA, CHCS,
and Essentris, as well as commercial and open source Electronic Health
Records that the government may be considering for acquisition.    PHASE
 II: The Phase II effort, dedicated towards creating a new toolset, or
configuring an existing toolset, to generate approximately 10,000
medical images and complex medical narrative texts, that can be ingested
 into the TATRC Early Stage Platform (ESP), or otherwise be made
available to TATRC-funded research partners.  The vendor should propose
whether it will make these data sets available under an open source or
commercial licensing arrangement, and at what cost.  Phase II will
include a qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis of the
quality of the synthetic data set as judged by government subject matter
 experts.  During Phase II, TATRC will work with the awardees to
introduce their technology to particular functional sponsors who might
make use of the data under the proposed open source or commercial
license. This would provide a potential technology transition route in
Phase III in to a military medical acquisition office, perhaps using a
Military Health System or DOD-wide enterprise licensing agreement, but
it is not guaranteed that this would occur.  For those vendors
considering releasing the toolsets of synthetically generated data set
to the open source community, TATRC will introduce the awardees to
OSEHRA.     PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III efforts would be
aimed at bringing the development of synthetic medical images and
narrative medical texts to a state where it represented the equivalent
of real data, and could be used reliably to conduct medical informatics
research. At the end of Phase III, the SBIR recipient may be able to
continue to license the tool sets and generated synthetic data to JPC-1,
 TATRC, or other military medical customers and TATRC specified partners
 for a particular time period. Outside of the military medical world,
the offeror might be able to license the data to commercial vendors of
electronic health records, health data warehouses, or health information
 exchanges for use in furthering development of these technologies. As
one example, the Veterans Administration and\/or HHS might also be
interested in the use of such medical synthetic data sets for use in
their research programs.     Offerors should note that SBIR Phase III
refers to work that derives from, extends, or logically concludes
effort(s) performed under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded
by sources other than the SBIR Program. Phase III work is typically
oriented towards technology transition to Acquisition Programs of Record
 and\/or commercialization of SBIR research or technology. In Phase III,
 the small business is expected to obtain funding from non-SBIR
government sources and\/or the private sector to develop or transition
the prototype into a viable product or service for sale in the military
or private sector markets.",

        "topic_name": "Mobile Application for Improved Sleep through
Sleep Hygiene Training Feedback",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Design, develop and deploy a mobile
application which provides sleep hygiene training feedback and cueing to
 improve sleep quantity and quality.    DESCRIPTION:  The U.S. Army
Surgeon General has defined the Performance Triad as a component to
improve the readiness and resiliency of U.S. Army personnel (Bermudez,
2013; USAPHC Public Affairs Office, 2012). The components of the Triad
are Activity, Nutrition, and Sleep (ANS). A service member"s health
status can affect his\/her function and quality of life, and is critical
 to force readiness. Wellness tracking and feedback may provide a means
to incentivize and encourage health-promoting activities in Soldiers,
civilians, and families. Mobile platforms (e.g., smartphones, tablets)
and their software apps are in widespread use across military and
civilian populations; health and wellness applications are abundant. The
 availability and acceptance of these technologies presents an
opportunity for the development of a mobile application that gives
service members access to a personalized tool for promoting lifestyle
changes that can lead to improved health among Army team members.
The objective of this SBIR is to solicit concepts for the design,
development, and deployment of a mobile application to investigate the
efficacy of feedback and awareness of sleep quality in improving sleep
quality. Challenges that need to be addressed are: 1) acquiring accurate
 sleep metrics unobtrusively over longer periods of time (weeks to
months); 2) analyzing those metrics to identify the best behavioral
targets for sleep hygiene improvement in a given individual; and 3)
implementing an effective methodology (e.g., gamification, social\/peer
engagement, reinforcement) for inducing positive behavioral change.
The app should track relevant data and provide personalized feedback to
address the following sleep hygiene training rules: 1) Stick to a
Consistent Wake-Up and Bedtime Every Day of the Week; 2) Use the Bedroom
 Only for Sleep and Sex; 3) Resolve Daily Dilemmas Outside of the
Bedroom; 4) Establish a Bedtime Routine; 5) Establish an Aerobic
Exercise Routine and Stick To It; 6) Create a Quiet and Comfortable
Sleep Environment; 7) Don"t Be a Clock Watcher; 8) Don"t Consume
Caffeine Within 4 Hours of Bedtime; 9) Don"t Use Alcohol as a Sleep Aid;
 10) Don"t Take Naps During the Day (If You Have Trouble Sleeping at
Night); 11) Don"t Smoke Cigarettes Immediately Before Bedtime; and 12)
Get Out of Bed and Go to Another Room If Sleep Does Not Come in 30
Minutes (Caldwell &amp; Caldwell, 2003; Dunbar, 2013). Sleep metrics and
 these rules are leveraged into positive improvement in sleep hygiene
should be a significant focus of the proposed project.     PHASE I:
Conceptualize, design, and build a solution for a mobile application
which allows for tracking of a person"s sleep habits and data as well as
 cues and feedback to encourage behavior modification to improve sleep
quality. Required Phase I deliverables will include: research design for
 validating the app; prototype with limited testing in demonstrating
proof-of-concept, research plans for validation testing; and
commercialization strategy including regulatory plans if necessary. The
solution should be developed on a platform that is compliant with
regulations around health care data security and encryption and the
proposal should have a plan to address any FDA issues that the proposed
solution could engender (USDHHS, 2013). Literature and market review
should be done as part of the proposal background information and not as
 a task to be executed during Phase I period. Applications should
clearly describe a specific proposed solution and conceptual development
 of the solution should be performed during the proposal writing process
 and not as part of Phase I tasks. Although it is anticipated that in
vitro testing and consultation from subject matter experts will occur
there should be no formal human use testing proposed or executed during
this 6-month Phase I period due to requirement of second level DoD
(Department of Defense) review, which generally adds more time beyond
the 6-month Phase I period.     PHASE II:  Complete a fully functional,
deployable prototype of the components demonstrated in Phase I. Assess
the proposed solution in controlled clinical field trials. The trial
should be designed to assess the benefit of sleep hygiene training and
the application on sleep quality. Applicants are encouraged to seek
samples with high military relevance or translation potential.     PHASE
 III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  Phase III efforts should be focused towards
 technology transition, preferably commercialization of SBIR research
and development. This should include assisting the military in
transitioning the technology to widespread deployment and use as well as
 plans to secure funding from non-STTR\/SBIR government sources and \/or
 the private sector to develop or transition the prototype into a viable
 product for sale in the public and\/or private sector markets.",

        "topic_name": "Rapid Indicator of Potential for Weight
Gain\/Loss &amp;amp; Trending",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a commercial; off the shelf
test for daily assessing an individual"s biochemical modality for weight
 loss or gain potential before the weight change is observable (as
measured on a scale in pounds).      DESCRIPTION:  Problem: Obesity in
soldiers impacts operational readiness of personnel, increases in health
 care costs for treating obesity in active duty &amp; retired soldiers,
increases manpower costs to recruit and train personnel to replace
soldiers who are discharged because of weight management issues, and
increases the emotional and mental stress to soldiers struggling to
manage their weight.      According to a study performed by the Armed
Forces Health Surveillance Center between 1998 and 2010, the number of
soldiers deemed overweight more than tripled. In 2010, 86,183 troops, or
 5.3 percent of the force, received at least one clinical diagnosis of
obesity.  As such, the military is now re-examining its training
programs and is driving commanders to discharge soldiers determined
unfit to fight due to obesity. Fifteen times more troops were discharged
 from the US Army this year due to obesity than five years prior. With
scores of recruits unfit to serve due to the extra pounds, the country"s
 military leaders have deemed it a national security concern."A healthy
and fit force is essential to national security,"Cmdr. Leslie Hull-Ryde,
 a Pentagon spokeswoman, told the Post."Our service members must be
physically prepared to deploy on a moment"s notice anywhere on the globe
 to extremely austere and demanding conditions."Figure 1: (not shown) A
graph of number of service members diagnosed as overweight from 1998 to
2008; the line is stable (no slope) at ~20,000 members until 2002 when
it trends upward at a 45 degree angle (slope of 15,000 additional
members every 2 years).  Source: USA Today using DoD data.    For
example, the Army kicked out 1,625 active-duty personnel for being out
of shape during the first 10 months of the year  nearly 16 times more
than in 2007, the peak of wartime deployment cycles, the Washington Post
 reported.  An article written by the Associated Press describing the
overweight soldiers in our military (titled"Are U.S. Troops Too Fat to
Fight?"), discusses the overweight trends of the active duty and reserve
 military, but also the recruits who are too heavy to enter into the
military. The military community has always been a cross section of
society -- good or bad. These days, as our country increases in size, it
 is only a matter of time before the military shares the traits of
obesity and associated illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, and
some forms of cancer to name a few.     According to a 2007 article in
the American Journal of Health Promotion, the Department of Defense
spends more than $1.1 billion annually for medical care associated with
excess weight and obesity. The increase in health care costs do not end
when active duty does either. The Veterans Affairs health system
increasingly is strained by vets piling on pounds and developing
weight-related diseases like diabetes. They tend to be sicker than the
general population. More than 70 percent are overweight and 33 percent
are obese, said Richard Harvey, a health psychologist at the VA Center
for Health Promotion. Pain is the biggest reason they give for not
exercising, and 31 percent say a disability prevents it, he said.  About
 20 percent of veterans have diabetes, compared to 7 percent to 8
percent of the general population    Solution:  Measuring weight on a
scale is the standard method for determining whether an individual has
gained weight.  However, scales are often un-calibrated and only
register significant, observable weight gains of several pounds.  In
addition, weight gain may be inaccurately attributed to water gain,
muscle mass increase, or a menstrual cycle (in women) that fluctuate
daily and make trending of weight changes difficult.  Lastly, trending
an individual"s weight change is best measured and compared to
measurements taken at the same time and conditions each day, which is
difficult in military settings.  Overall, the best this standard method
could ever accomplish is to indicate a significant weight change after
it has already occurred.  A better method would provide a soldier an
indication that they may be gaining weight before they actually gain
weight, while they can still take action to prevent the weight gain.
One potential solution is to provide soldiers with the status of
fatstoring metabolic processes that are occurring inside their bodies
that would allow for the correction of poor eating and exercise habits
or reinforcement of effective eating and exercise habits before weight
gain is measureable.  One method would be the use of a simple, reliable,
 non-invasive and inexpensive test that when applied, would indicate
whether an individual"s metabolism is either storing fat, burning fat,
or is adequately balancing energy intake to output.  When this test is
complemented by nutritional education and used by the soldier before
eating, it would either discourage them from consuming potentially
fattening items or reinforce good eating habits depending on the results
 of the test.  In addition, utilizing a test indicator between meals
would encourage an individual to exercise more if a negative indication
is realized as well as strengthen willpower to not snack.
Operational Application: this new capability would be utilized by
members to make better, more informed intervention decisions.  The first
 detectable indication of a military member's weight gain is when
superiors notice that the individual's uniforms appear tight.  In those
situations, the supervisor is alerted and will schedule with the member.
  Part of the counseling will include a recommendation to see a
nutritional expert (either at a clinic, gym, or referral to civilian
care).  In addition, the individual may self-report to a nutritional
expert. Also, an individual failing the waist measurement or a body mass
 index standard will be referred to a nutritional expert as part of the
weight management program.  The nutritional expert will provide them
with the usual instruction and information, but will also be able to
provide the member with a tool to check their body's current metabolic
processes to identify if their weight gain metabolic processes are
switched on or off.  This simple saliva test would be accomplished
before the individual has a meal to help reinforce good dietary
behaviors or to make dietary adjustments before they eat.   This
feedback is provided immediately, allowing the member to make better
decisions before additional weight gain occurs and is detected (via
measurement on a scale).  Active duty, dependents and retirees who are
diagnosed as obese would be prescribed this test to be accomplished by
the individual as part of the treatment.  Members on the weight
management program may be required to record the time, date and results
of daily measurements to accompany recordings of caloric intake to
enable trending.  This capability will be commercialized and marketed to
 the public, with the DoD holding the IP rights, that will allow anyone
to purchase the test over the counter.  The test will be designed to be
administered inconspicuously to allow individuals to test themselves in
public, discreetly and privately.      Scientific Approach: A biomarker
in the saliva could be adapted and commercialized to provide an
effective indicator for assessing fat-storage metabolism processes.
Saliva is being researched as diagnostic fluid of the future as it is a
usually quick, uncomplicated, and non-invasive method for sample
collection while still providing usable information on metabolic
processes.  Salivary biomarkers have been successfully integrated into
developmental and behaviorally-oriented research. One such biomarker is
Adiponectin, a hormone secreted by fat cells that could be utilized as a
 biomarker for potential weight gain (mentioned here as an example).
  Adiponectin (Ad) is an adipocyte-derived hormone that plays an
essential role in regulating insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and
atherogenesis.  In adults, adiponectin levels in the blood are inversely
 correlated with body fat percentage and are significantly lower in
obesity. In other words, the more obese the patient, the lower the
adiponectin levels in the blood. Levels of adiponectin may help to
estimate the risk of obesity related diseases and conditions such as
arteriosclerosis, coronary arteritis, type II Diabetes, peripheral
artery disease, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular, heart and
coronary diseases.  Weight reduction significantly increases the
circulating levels of adiponectin.  Standard Adiponectin testing is
performed on a blood sample normally drawn from a vein in the patient"s
arm.     Adiponectin Saliva Test:  Levels of some hormones in saliva
change in a fashion similar to that in plasma in response to a disease
or physiological condition. Since saliva is an easy to obtain biological
 fluid, measurements of salivary hormonal changes are preferred in
diagnoses and treatments. Therefore, it is of interest to examine the
nature of salivary Ad. While there have been two publications in the
literature reporting presence of Ad in human saliva, the nature of
salivary Ad has not been characterized for possible use as a biomarker.
 The presence of Ad inhibitor(s) in saliva that co-eluted with the
dimeric form of Ad in an assay may lead to underestimation of Ad in
saliva.  To effectively use Ad as a reliable method, a method must be
developed to separate adiponectin from inhibitors of
adiponectin-anti-adiponectin binding before assay.      Other biomarkers
 in saliva may be a more effective and accurate indicator for assessing
fat-storage metabolism processes and will need to be researched &amp;
developed.        Figure 2 &amp; 3 (not shown): a graphic of an
individual using a possible configuration of commercial product
(configured to look like a toothpick) that has biomarker colorimetric
detection coating embedded in the end as a biomarker test for weight
gaining metabolic processes; in figure 2 the color green appears to
indicate the absence of biomarker(s) in an individual"s saliva and that
the fat-storage metabolism processes are not occurring and allows for
behavioral reinforcement; in figure 3 the color red appears to indicate
the presence of biomarker(s) in an individual"s saliva that indicate
fat-storage metabolism processes are occurring and allows for behavioral
 modification    PHASE I: Phase I work will involve research to identify
 potential biomarker(s) in saliva that will allow for the design of a
colorimetric test for determining the presence or absence of the weight
change metabolic biomarker(s).  If adiponectin (Ad) in human saliva is
selected as one of the biomarkers, the nature of salivary Ad will need
to be characterized.  The colorimetric, saliva-based test to be
developed must be non-toxic and disposable.  The conclusion of the phase
 I project is the successful proof-of-concept demonstration of the
biomarker in a lab setting using human saliva\/simulant with optimal
concentrations of biomarker(s).  Appropriate controls will be used and
target accuracy is 75% to 90% accurate identification of weight gain
biomarker(s) presences\/absence.     PHASE II: Phase II work will
optimize and validate the biomarker saliva test developed in the phase I
 project. Refinement and optimization of the manufacturing processes in
preparation of mass production and commercialization.  The detection
levels of the presence\/absence colorimetric test will be optimized to
minimize the number of false negative and false positive test results
for typical adult saliva.  If necessary, the FDA approval pathway should
 be outlined and IRB oversight may be needed.  Validation may include
comparisons of detected levels of selected biomarkers in saliva with
concentrations from other methods (ie: blood samples).  Phase II
technical proposals should include a detailed explanation of how the
small business will obtain a monetary return on investment within two
years of completion of Phase II (e.g. through sales, licensing
agreements, venture capital, non-SBIR grants).  The conclusion of the
phase II project is the successful production of a biomarker saliva test
 system and testing using human saliva.  Appropriate controls will be
used and target accuracy is 90% to 95% accurate identification of weight
 gain biomarker(s) presences\/absence. Potential commercial and clinical
 partners for Phase III and beyond should be identified.    PHASE III:
If successful, Phase II work will result in the development of a
commercial saliva-based test for weight change metabolic biomarker(s).
During Phase III, transition of the manufacturing processes to a large
scale manufacturer may be needed as well as the development of optimized
 packaging, marketing and advertising to maximize commercial
applicability.  Additional experiments may be performed as necessary to
prepare for FDA review as necessary. A plan for protection of
intellectual property should be created and executed. A detailed market
analysis will be conducted, an initial clinical application for the
system will be selected, and a commercial partner selected.  This new
test will be available to military personnel and veterans who are
diagnosed as obese and\/or struggling with being overweight.
Commercial application includes dieticians and health professionals
around the world who could prescribe or recommend this monitoring tool
for treating obesity and diseases impacted by being overweight.",

        "topic_name": "Development of a Multiplex Bioassay for Early
Predictors of Multiple Organ Injury",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Define and develop existing,
validated, pre-clinical biomarkers of organ-specific injury that
correlate with diverse types of injury to include but not limited to
systemic toxicity.  Define and resolve issues involved with the use of a
 diverse set of biomarkers with a single multiplexed methodology.
Define and resolve issues related to the isolation and use of diverse
biological samples to include but not limited to plasma and urine.
Develop a prototype multiplex biomarker assay and algorithm specific and
 sensitive to diverse and common types of organ injury to include but
not limited to kidney, liver, heart, and lung.      DESCRIPTION:
Biomarkers are biometric measurements that provide critical quantitative
 information about the biological condition of the individual being
tested.  The literature is rich with pre-clinical toxicity biomarkers,
particular hepato- and nephrotoxicity biomarkers, many of which are
perhaps even useful for organ injury independent of systemic toxicity,
such as ischemia. Of particular value are early, predictive, noninvasive
 biomarkers that have potential clinical transferability. Efforts
between regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry are underway
 for the coordinated discovery, qualification, verification and
validation of early predictive toxicity biomarkers. Early predictive
safety biomarkers are those that are detectable and quantifiable prior
to the onset of irreversible tissue injury and which are associated with
 a mechanism of action relevant to a specific type of potential hepatic
(Daniel J Antoine, 2013) or renal injury (Vishal S. Vaidya, 2008).
Potential drug toxicity biomarkers are typically endogenous
macromolecules present in diverse types of biological fluids, with
varying immunoreactivity, which can present bioanalytical challenges.
Further, a panel of biomarkers that are representative of diverse types
of organ injury utilized in a single, multiplex bioassay present
bioanalytical challenges.  For example, assessment of liver injury may
involve early markers of metabolic and excretory function.  Proteins,
small molecules, lipids, nucleic acids could all indicate the onset of
early liver injury.  In some cases, plasma proteins are best to indicate
 the presence of liver injury that arises from drug-induced liver
injury, whereas in liver cholestasis a combination of protein and
nucleic acid biomarkers may be more appropriate.  In a similar manner,
proximal tubule injury in acute kidney injury may be best indicated by a
 protein in urine rather than plasma. Thus, while a multitude of
pre-clinical organ-specific candidate biomarkers are evident in the
literature, a wide array of methodology and analytical methods would be
required to assess all of them in order to screen for early, predictive
indicators of organ injury.    A single multiplex bioassay, sensitive
and specific to a multitude of highly prioritized organ-specific
biomarkers is required.  The bioassay must be able to analyze a diverse
set of macromolecules, originating from a diverse set of biological
specimens, and analyzed in a single detection platform.            PHASE
 I:  Identify and define the number and physical properties of existing
pre-clinical candidate biomarkers of highly prioritized organ-specific
injury, particularly relevant to, but not limited to systemic toxicity
of, but not limited to kidney, liver, heart, and lung.  Identify and
define all technological barriers related to development of a diverse
set of biomarkers on a single multiplex bioassay with a single detection
 platform.  Conceptualize and design an innovative solution to overcome
technical challenges of measuring diverse types of macromolecules on a
single multiplex bioassay with a single detection system.     PHASE II:
 Using results from Phase I, fabricate and validate a prototype bioassay
 with the following requirements:  1.  The bioassay is multiplex   2.
The biomarkers originate from diverse biospecimens  3.  The biomarkers
are representative of multiple types of early organ injury  4.  The
bioassay requires a single detection system  5.  Reasonable time to
results: Threshold: 4h; Objective: 1h  6.  The biomarker assay must have
 significant commercialization potential    Key deliverables: 1. A
technology that can predict early the onset of organ injury.  2. A
technology that is capable of detecting and analyzing diverse types of
macromolecules (protein, nucleic acid, small molecules, such as lipids
or hormones).  3. A technology that can handle and process specimens
from diverse types of biospecimens. 4. Ease of use; must not require
extensive laboratory experience or training. 5. Process will include all
 steps from initial treatment of sample to readout of result.    PHASE
III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  Commercialization and transition pathway
identified for a maturing refined product. It should identify one or
more Phase III military applications or acquisitions programs and likely
 path(s) for transition from research to operational capability. It
should identify EITHER (a) one or more potential commercial applications
 OR (b) one or more commercial technology(ies) that could be potentially
 inserted into defense systems as a result of this SBIR project.",

        "topic_name": "Application of a Wireless Finger-mounted
Ultrasound Transducer and Imaging Platform",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this topic is to
develop and demonstrate a wearable finger-mounted ultrasound transducer
and ultrasound imaging platform that uses wireless connectivity for
image display and operator interface functions on common commercially
available hand held platforms.  Medics in isolated environments are now
conducting FAST exams in the field to determine internal injuries before
 casualties are transported out of the area and current wired handheld
ultrasound transducer\/probes are too large and bulky to be used in the
combat environment.  Medics need a finger-mounted probe to slide under
body armor to examine casualties and have the capability to transmit
ultrasound images wirelessly from a wearable finger probe to a SMART
device which is connected to a secure communication network that can
further transmit these images to a Medical Officer in the rear area.
This research will incrementally advance the state of the art for point
of injury care and on attended casualty evacuation vehicles such that
the final demonstration shows proof-of-concept feasibility for medical
information exchange and telementoring from any location on the
battlefield.     DESCRIPTION: This topic is designed to focus and
address the current gap in availability to provide ultrasound capability
 to isolated combat environments.  The FDA approved the first portable
ultrasound-Smartphone device in January 2011.  Medics are working with
small combat teams in extreme isolated environments that casualty
evacuations are not readily available.  Finger-mounted ultrasound
transducers have demonstrated ease of use over traditional hand-held
transducers and offer the opportunity to simplify the use of ultrasound
and allow wider adoption in military and point of care settings.
However when coupled to traditional stationary ultrasound imaging
platforms, operator freedom is impeded.  A further barrier to wide
adoption is the lack of training to interpret images.  New portable
electronic platforms offer portable display and connectivity features,
which offer compelling advantages for ultrasound imaging and archival in
 the field.  These"rear echelon"supporting elements could receive
imagery in near real-time over a secure military radio network from
remotely located Medics and Medical Officers can offer helpful guidance
or interpret image acquisition in real time.     A wearable probe and
imaging platform with wireless connectivity (e.g. Ultra Wideband, Secure
 Bluetooth, Ultraviolet communications, etc.) for image display, image
archiving and user interface functions would simplify the acquisition of
 ultrasound images and free the operator, enabling greater utility
especially for:  a) field combat\/portable use and b) procedure driven
point of care use including intra-operative use, vascular access
procedures, biopsies etc.  By leveraging commonly available third party
display and data entry platforms in conjunction with the wearable finger
 probe (i.e. SMART devices, Tablets, etc.), a new level of portability,
access and ease of use can be introduced to ultrasound imaging.
After Phase III development, the final production model of the secure
wireless capability must be ruggedized for shock, dust, sand, and water
resistance to enable reliable, uninterrupted operation in combat
vehicles on the move, to include operation and storage at extreme
temperatures, and the developer"s kit must be able to install this
capability on the devices.  Size and weight are important factors.
Quantitative values for acceptable operational and storage temperatures
and power requirements should be planned to comply with applicable
MIL-SPECs (available on line).     PHASE I:  Research solutions for
technical challenges on this topic as identified above for a capability
that incorporates feasible solution for a system with the specification
for the ultrasound finger probe and wearable imaging platform with
wireless connectivity.  Develop a finger probe and demonstrate wireless
connectivity (e.g. Ultra wideband, Secure Bluetooth, Ultraviolet
communication, etc.) for imaging and archiving using a commercially
available imaging platform.    Flesh out commercialization plans that
were developed in the Phase I proposal for elaboration or modification
to be incorporated in the Phase II proposal.  Explore commercialization
potential with civilian emergency medical service systems development
and manufacturing companies.  Seek partnerships within government and
private industry for transition and commercialization of the production
version of the product.    PHASE II:  From the Phase I design; develop
and demonstrate a functional prototype of the finger probe and wearable
imaging platform with wireless connectivity for data display and user
interface functions.  Conduct regulatory and safety testing to support
clinical use.  Design and implement a field trial to validate the
superiority of the finger probe\/wearable platform versus conventional
probe\/ imaging platform in addressing field use of ultrasound.    In
addition to demonstrating secure wireless connectivity to mobile SMART
Phones; the prototype device should demonstrate and integrate
communications into the military tactical radio communications networks.
   Demonstrate the system with soldier medical attendants in a relevant
environment; such as at a USA Army TRADOC Battle Lab.  Flesh out
commercialization plans contained in the Phase II proposal for
elaboration or modification in Phase III.  Firm up collaborative
relationships and establish agreements with military and civilian end
users to conduct proof-of-concept evaluations in Phase III.  Begin to
execute transition to Phase III commercialization potential in
accordance with the Phase II commercialization plan.     PHASE III:
Refine and execute the commercialization plan included in the Phase II
Proposal.  Phase III will commercialize the finger probe and wearable
imaging platform for end-user sale in both the military and private
sector markets for commercially available devices. This effort includes,
 but is not limited to obtaining FDA and other regulatory clearances,
manufacturing, clinical studies, product enhancements to support other
clinical applications.     Execute proof-of-concept evaluation in a
suitable operational environment.  Present the prototype project, as a
candidate for fielding, to applicable Army, Navy\/Marine Corps, Air
Force, Coast Guard, Department of Defense, Program Managers for Combat
Casualty Care systems along with government and civilian program
managers for emergency, remote, and wilderness medicine within state and
 civilian health care organizations, and the Departments of Justice,
Homeland Security, Interior, and Veteran"s Administration.  Execute
further commercialization and manufacturing through collaborative
relationships with partners identified in Phase II.",

        "topic_name": "Non-Invasive, Head-Mounted Measures of Vestibular
 Function",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop and test a single
head-mounted device capable of measuring vestibular function to include
assessment of vestibular-ocular, vestibular-auricular,
vestibular-perceptual and vestibular spinal reflexes.      DESCRIPTION:
Dizziness and vertigo are common in nearly all reported studies of mTBI
and contribute disproportionately to disability (Terrio et al., 2009).
The 2009 in-theater IRAQ study by Balaban and Hoffer found vestibular
pathology in over 90% of the observed cases of acute mTBI and over 80%
of the chronic mTBI cases. Incidence rates vary depending on the injury
cause, site, criteria and whether the clinician's primary expertise is
neurological or otolaryngolocal. There is a need to develop simple,
easy-to-use, portable screening devices to assess military personnel in
theater to determine whether the patient needs to be evacuated for
higher levels of care. In the United States, mTBI accounts for
approximately 90% of the new cases of medically diagnosed head injuries
each year and is associated with headache, dizziness, vertigo,
disequilibrium, or disorientation, often in the absence of abnormal
brain imaging results. (Gottshall et al., 2003).     Recent advances in
several technology areas including MEMS accelerometers and miniature
high resolution cameras make feasible the development of a head-mounted
assessment device that will permit objective measures of vestibular
function. Traditional stimuli for vestibular reflex responses required
acceleration of the head or body. Increased understanding of vestibular
reflexes have led to new tests of vestibular function such as the
cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) and the ocular
vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP). The stimuli for these
reflexes are loud clicks (CVEMP) or a tap on the forehead (oVEMP) which
preferentially test the saccular or utricle function of the vestibular
otolith organs.     The combination of technology and understanding of
vestibular function will permit a single well-designed, head-mounted
display to perform the assessment of several clinically important tests
including: Vestibular Ocular Reflex (VOR); head thrust test of otolith
function; electronystagmography; Dynamic Visual Acuity Test (DVAT);
dynamic body balance and Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV). This project
seeks the design and development of a device that will objectively
assess as many aspects of static and dynamic vestibular function as is
currently capable with available miniaturized technologies. This device
will benefit military medics assessing vestibular dysfunction following
concussive events as well as civilian clinicians diagnosing patients
with balance disorders.     PHASE I: Integrate a combination of
vestibular tests to assist clinicians in the assessment of vestibular
function. At a minimum the tests will include SVV, VOR, DVAT, head
thrust, ocular counteroll and balance measures. Identify the best
technologies to provide vestibular stimuli for the selected combination
of tests as well as the optimal sensors to measure the reflex and
perceptual responses. Develop and demonstrate a prototype capable of
both providing stimuli as well as measuring responses.    PHASE II:
Refine the prototype developed in Phase I to demonstrate and clinically
validate the capabilities in health care settings. Using feedback from
operators testing in the clinical environment, provide
technician-friendly interfaces for data collection and analysis.
PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: In conjunction with health care
professionals transition the new device into clinical use both in the
military and civilian sectors",

        "topic_name": "Mobile Applications\/Web-Based Management
Solutions for Hearing Injuries",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a mobile, web-based
application that assists\/guides patients with hearing loss and tinnitus
 through aural rehabilitation therapy (improving signal identification
and speech in noise function) and provides tinnitus management. The
program will identify best practice applications for servicemen
struggling to habituate to the effects of hearing loss and tinnitus.
Possible solutions are to incorporate components of cognitive-behavioral
 therapy (CBT), tinnitus masking (TM), tinnitus retraining therapy
(TRT), neuromodulation (NM) along with introducing aural rehabilitation
therapy (ART) (J. A. Henry, Schechter, et al., 2006a, 2006b). The tool
will identify users with ear-level devices (hearing aids, noise
generators, cranial nerve stimulators, and combination instruments) and
accommodate and improve effective use of such devices. The tool(s)
applications will be compatible with networks and telemedicine data
flows within the DOD\/VA community to protect information security by
preventing the exchange or transmission of personally identifiable
information.    DESCRIPTION: Due to excessive noise exposure and noise
induced trauma servicemen are often plagued with the effects of hearing
loss and\/or tinnitus. Since 2005 the VA Annual Benefits Report reveals
that tinnitus is the most common individual service-connected disability
 in veterans, and hearing loss is the second most prevalent (AVBR 2011).
 As of the most current report (aVBR 2011), there were 840,864 veterans
who had been awarded a service connection for their tinnitus, and
148,345 have been added in 2012. Hearing loss measured 701,760 service
connected members in 2011, and an additional 90,427 have been documented
 in 2012. Hearing loss is routinely rehabilitated with hearing aids, but
 aural rehabilitation to accommodate to the hearing prosthesis and
optimize function is not standard practice. There is no current standard
 treatment for tinnitus or aural rehabilitation therapy available to
these patients. Further, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
published a comprehensive analysis of the comparative effectiveness of
current treatments for tinnitus and found that of 9,725 journal
citations, only 52 were found to be worthy of comparative review and the
 strength of evidence of effective treatment for tinnitus was low in all
 cases (AHRQ CER Review 122).  Additionally, there is limited access to
care in remote settings or while deployed in theater for military
members where many of these injuries are sustained by through noise
trauma. There is a growing consensus that the use sound therapy in the
either the TRT, or Progressive Tinnitus Management program (PTM-VA)
alone or combined with other novel and potentially synergistic emerging
technologies such as ART and NM may be the optimal approach. However,
neither of the currently utilized systems (TRT, PTM-VA) are specific to
military or former military populations. This system proposes a military
 specific aural rehabilitation therapy (ART), with military unique
content supporting auditory processing to be augmented with the use of
appropriate synergistic devices. Following the identification of the
most appropriate device\/strategy or combination thereof, the web-based
system will utilize military noise (tank, gunfire, ship noise,
background commands etc.) along with branch specific military verbal
commands to help the hearing impaired, or tinnitus suffering patient
develop auditory processing strategies targeted to improve speech in
noise listening abilities and sound identification exercises.     PHASE
I:  Identify\/develop synergistic components of best tinnitus management
 strategies and combine into a web-based program that includes military
specific aural rehabilitation therapy as outlined. Phase I includes
identification and recording of the most common military background
noises and pairing them with military unique verbal commands. The
program should be developed with aspects of speech in noise testing,
listening exercises, possibly in a gaming scenario. The noise and
commands should be military specific, realistic, and relevant. The
signal to noise ratio should change as patient auditory processing
improves.     PHASE II: Phase II will focus on finalizing and validating
 the successfulness of the program. Commonly acceptable, already
standardized speech in noise tests conducted before and after program
use will determine the successfulness of the ART system. Effective
maneuvering and obtaining program objectives can serve as secondary
measures of effectiveness.    PHASE III: Phase III will focus on
integrating the mobile device into the DOD\/VA medical treatment
facilities, both hardened and expeditionary. The application should be
available for wide dissemination for clinical use through web
accessibility.",

Vascular Tissue in the Extremities After Traumatic Injury",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this effort is to
develop a new innovative technology that may include the use of novel
biomaterials, nanotopologies, cellular\/tissue-based strategies or
biologics, to reconstruct and regenerate vascular tissue in the
extremities after traumatic injury.    DESCRIPTION: Blood vessel trauma
leading to hemorrhage or ischemia is a significant cause of morbidity
and mortality to wounded warriors.  Methods of reconstruction are now
applied to approximately half of these cases whose rate has risen by 5
times in modern combat.  Selective ligation and interposition bypass
grafting with an autologous vein remain the standard treatments for
segmental blood vessel loss.  However, the complexity and extensiveness
of soft tissue trauma involving multiple extremities often leave
vascular surgeons limited sites to harvest autologous grafts.  Hence
there is a need to seek alternative methods for addressing the issue of
vascular reconstruction and revascularization. As the therapeutic field
continues to advance, it is likely more nanotechnology, cellular,
mechanical, biologic or pharmacological components may also be
incorporated into therapeutic strategies to promote or direct
revascularization and repair segmental vascular defects.       PHASE I:
 Conceptualize and design an innovative solution for addressing vascular
 injury that will enable the reconstruction and promote regeneration of
vascular tissue in the extremities where autologous graft harvest is not
 an option.  Such strategies may include the use of biomaterials,
nanotopologies, cellular, tissue, pharmacological or biological
components.  It is likely that the most successful therapeutic
approaches would incorporate two or more of the described components.
The solution should be able to address vascular defects of various
lengths, diameters and complexity. The solution can be a permanent or
temporary repair strategy that may address immediate limb salvage or
long-term regeneration.  The required Phase I deliverables will include:
 1) a research design for the proposed therapeutic strategy and 2) A
preliminary prototype with limited testing to demonstrate in vitro
proof-of-concept evidence that demonstrate durability and efficacy of
the technology (to be executed at Phase I). Other supportive data from
in vivo proof-of-feasibility studies demonstrating revascularization
which lead to functional improvement and attenuate tissue loss may also
be provided during this Phase I effort.      PHASE II:  The researcher
shall design, develop, test, finalize and validate the practical
implementation of the prototype therapeutic that implements the Phase I
methodology to reconstruct or regenerate vascular tissue over this
2-year effort. The researcher shall also describe in detail the
transition plan for the Phase III effort.    PHASE III:  Plans on the
commercialization\/technology transition and regulatory pathway should
be executed here and lead to FDA clearance\/approval.  They include: 1)
identifying a relevant patient population for clinical testing to
evaluate safety and efficacy and 2) GMP manufacturing sufficient
materials for evaluation. The small business should also provide a
strategy to secure additional funding from non-SBIR government sources
and \/or the private sector to support these efforts.   Military
application: The desired therapy will allow military practitioners to
apply the therapy.  Commercial application: Healthcare professionals
world-wide could utilize this product as a therapy meant to improve the
standard of care presently available to patients suffering from vascular
 trauma.",

        "topic_name": "Upper Limb Assistive and Rehabilitation Orthotic
Device",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To develop a rehabilitation and
assistive technology that enhances and\/or returns upper limb motor
function losses due to traumatic combat injuries. Develop a portable and
 easy to use hand worn assistive device that is applicable in daily life
 and outdoor activities.  The device should have biomimetic motion
application and structural similarity to biological hand. The device
should also be safe to use, relatively light weight, affordable,
scalable, and have low power consumption and a wireless capability for
data transfer.      DESCRIPTION: Musculoskeletal injury (MSI) is the
leading cause of health problems for the military. It can be caused by
traumatic combat injuries and physically straining risk factors such as
military training, repeated combat deployment, carrying heavy load,
standing for extended periods of time, walking long distance and
participating in sport. [1] Vascular limb injuries are now among the
main MSI injuries that cause severe bleeding, ischemia, amputation, and
death. Improved torso protection for soldiers resulted in new injury
patterns. Almost 46% of all combat vascular injuries affect the lower
limbs, and almost 25% affect the upper limbs. [2] 19% percent of
soldiers returning from combat after completing deployment required an
orthopedic surgical consultation and 4% of soldiers required surgery.
[3] These statistics highlight great need for improved orthotic
rehabilitation and assistive devices to help restore limb functions. The
 device is intended to be used both as an assistive and rehabilitation
mechanism.  It should be able to easily transition between assistive
device and rehab tool if the patient"s injury allows for recovery. As an
 assistive device it is worn by patients for extended period of time to
accomplish day to day activities where the use of two hands is required.
 It is also important that the device be lightweight and safe to be worn
 in close contact with human skin tissue. The intent of the
rehabilitation device is to enhance recovery until adequate muscle
function is restored. The design should be scalable to fit different
hand sizes and have wireless capability to monitor patient"s recovery
progress by an occupational therapist or other clinician. The device can
 then be abandoned after a point of recovery and limb function is
restored. [4] Challenges experienced with upper limb impairments include
 muscular weakness, pain, sensory loss and decreased grip, pinch,
strength, finger tactile sensations, and cognition functions. The hand
particularly presents a unique area of challenge in this research
endeavor because of its complexity: many degrees of freedom and large
numbers of tactile sensors in a relatively small area. Presently
available devices in the market are heavy, bulky, noisy and esthetically
 not pleasing. [4] Although current treatments have shown to be
successful in assisting and returning patients"motor functions to a
pseudo-normal level, they involve a lot of time and resources from
therapists.[5] These current limitations present an increased need and
large market demand for improved hand worn devices. The last several
years have resulted in actuator technology breakthroughs which open new
opportunities to advance research efforts on assistive and
rehabilitation devices. Future research efforts should address major
topic areas such as actuator types, power transmission, degrees of
freedom (DOF), intention sensing, and control methodologies that behaves
 like and exploit biological hand skeletal systems. A device that can be
 used to assist and rehabilitate patients without a great demand for
time, labor, and resources would have a high demand in the orthotics
industry.    Requirements for improved hand worn device:    Safety -

seriously harmful to the user.    Design - Mechanical designs should
consider the possibility of unpredicted erroneous operation of the
device controller while the device is actively actuated    Size - Design
 should be scalable to fit different hand sizes and easily reproduced
 Lightweight - The technology is intended to assist muscle weakness and
function loss, so it should not present additional barriers to keep the
device on for extended periods of time.    Multiuse- This device should
be intended for a wide range of patients with hand weakness whether they
 need permanent assistance or require short term muscle rehabilitation.
   Biomimetic - Should resemble the human biological muscle function and
 structure as closely as possible   Low power consumption-Actuated
device should be energy efficient and wearable for extended period of
time without having to plug\/recharge frequently     Wireless
technologies - Should have wireless capability to transmit data of limb
recovery progress to computing devices and physicians for real-time
results    Commercialization - The final device should be available at
affordable price for the general public.     PHASE I: This Phase is a
feasibility study that should demonstrate or determine the scientific,
technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of a selected concept.

proof of concept and key technological components.    Determine
technical feasibility of designed approach.    PHASE II: Finalize the
design from Phase I and complete component design, fabrication and
laboratory characterization experiments. Phase II should produce
prototype hardware, construct and demonstrate the operation of the
prototype based on phase I established performance goals. The device

        "topic_name": "Technologies to Train Myoelectric Prosthesis
Users for Optimal Functional Outcomes",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this effort is to
develop a new tool or technology that can optimize training outcomes for
 myoelectric prostheses.    DESCRIPTION: Myoelectric prostheses monitor
electrical signals generated by a patient"s muscle contractions and use
those signals to control prosthetic joint movements. Successful use of
myoelectric prostheses is dependent on providing patients with
high-quality, individualized pre-prosthetic training that becomes more
important with increasingly complex injuries and\/or use of more
advanced prostheses [1]. A number of different training paradigms have
been studied since the advent of myoelectric prostheses [2-5]; however,
few of those paradigms have transitioned into commercially available
training materials. Additionally, the limited number of commercially
available myoelectric training hardware and software packages that do
exist are often simplistic, manufacturer-specific, expensive, and not
motivating.     While evidence is available supporting that patients can
 learn with a myoelectric training system, little to no literature
exists showing that training actually helps improve patients"clinical
outcomes [2]. Therefore, a need exists for a myoelectric prosthesis
training tool or technology that can improve patient clinical outcomes,
motivate patients to train, and be used in the clinic and remotely by
the patient.  The metrics we would use for this effort are not how the
program works (that would be something the developer would establish),
but how it impacts the upper extremity prosthesis use.  So, the primary
metric would be compliance - does the amputee continue to use the
advanced prosthesis or do they just stop using it and put the prosthesis
 in the back of the closet.  If the amputee can"t control the advanced
prosthesis because they didn"t receive adequate training to fully
prepare them to utilize the prosthesis, they will stop using it.      A
second metric would be what daily or work tasks an amputee is able to
perform or accomplish with the myoelectrically controlled prosthesis
that they couldn't with the simple hook-prosthesis.  The myoelectric
controls utilize muscles to control the advanced prosthesis that would
not normally be used by a non-amputee to move the fingers, hand, wrist,
etc.  This requires tremendous effort to retrain both the muscles and
the person's thought process on how to use the prosthesis to accomplish
tasks as simple as picking up a glass. More intricate work such as
buttoning a shirt would require more intense training because this task
involves coordinated finger work rather than simply opening and closing a
 hand.      The third metric would be quality of life measurements; and a
 fourth metric would be social reintegration - that is, did the amputee,
 as a result of compliance and increased ability to control and work the
 advanced prosthesis (because of the advanced training), successfully
return to a job or the level of function they desired.    Additionally,
the training tool should also be able to adapt to conventional and
state-of-the-art control schemes, accommodate different amputation
levels, and apply to patients with and without targeted muscle
reinnervation (TMR).    PHASE I: Conceptualize and design an innovative
manufacturer-agnostic training solution for myoelectric prostheses
leading to a commercialized product that can quantifiably improve
patient outcomes. Such strategies may include hardware, software, or a
combination of the two. The solution should be affordable, portable, and
 reliable such that training may begin in a clinical environment under
the supervision of a clinician and the training may be continued at home
 or other remote locations. The required Phase I deliverables will
include: 1) a research design for the proposed therapeutic strategy and
2) A preliminary prototype with limited testing to demonstrate
proof-of-concept evidence of durability and efficacy of the technology
(to be executed at Phase I).    PHASE II: The researcher shall design,
develop, test, finalize and validate the practical implementation of the
 prototype therapeutic that implements the Phase I methodology to
optimize myoelectric prosthesis training outcomes over this Phase II
effort. This effort should include human subject trials comparing the
new training device with current standard of care myoelectric prosthesis
 training. The researcher shall also describe in detail the transition
plan for the Phase III effort.    PHASE III: Plans on the
commercialization\/technology transition and regulatory pathway should
be executed here and lead to FDA clearance\/approval. They include: 1)
identifying a relevant patient population for clinical testing to
evaluate safety and efficacy and 2) GMP manufacturing sufficient
materials for evaluation. The small business should also provide a
strategy to secure additional funding from non-SBIR government sources
and \/or the private sector to support these efforts. Military
application: The desired therapy will allow military practitioners to
apply the therapy. Commercial application: Healthcare professionals
world-wide could utilize this product as a therapy meant to improve the
standard of care presently available to patients suffering from
amputation.",

safe, lightweight power supply for the exoskeleton component of the
TALOS ensemble.          DESCRIPTION:  The TALOS ensemble is a new
initiative in USSOCOM that is intended to provide solutions for the
enhanced mobility\/protection\/situational awareness capabilities to
augment the direct assaulter.  As such, the power supply for the TALOS
ensemble will need to provide sufficient, dependable power to ensure
rapid, unencumbered movement of the operator.  Desired attributes of the
 power system also include light weight, low noise, and low to no
thermal signature.  Power sources should not require introduction of a
new logistics fuel to the battlefield.  The power source shall
produce\/store sufficient power to support a non-tethered 12 hour
mission at 4-5kW per hour.  The system shall be compatible with shore
power (i.e. helicopter power, ship power, Forward Operating Base grid
power, indigenous power infrastructure in the operational area).  The
power supply shall be able to utilize extraction platforms (e.g.,
helicopters and small craft) power to commence immediate system
recharge.  The power supply shall be able to scavenge power from sources
 found on a battlefield (i.e. power lines, car batteries, solar,
110\/220VAC power outlets, etc.). The power supply shall be rechargeable
 and ready for the next mission within 6 hours.  The size of the power
source shall not exceed 15"x 10"x 5".  The weight of the power source
shall not exceed 15 pounds.  The power source shall be nonflammable.
 A secondary objective of this effort is to enable Special Operations
Forces wearing exoskeleton type   equipment to more easily carry the
weight normally carried by an  operator while hiking over long
distances.      PHASE I:  Conduct a feasibility study to determine the
optimum method\/technology solution for powering the Exoskeleton element

SBIR effort is to conduct and document the results of a thorough
feasibility study to investigate what is in the art of the possible

 feasibility studies.  Operational prototypes developed with other than
SBIR funds that are provided at the end of Phase I feasibility studies
will not be considered in deciding what firm(s) will be selected for
Phase II.    PHASE II: Develop and demonstrate a prototype power supply
that meets the performance characteristics defined in the above
paragraph entitled"Description".  The prototype system will undergo both
 laboratory and limited field testing to assess its technology
readiness, its ability to integrate with the mechanical and electrical
sub-system components of the TALOS and ultimate utility for integration
into the TALOS ensemble.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This
technology is applicable to the commercial health\/medical industry to
assist in the recovery\/rehabilitation of injured\/physically disabled
individuals or enhancement of life issues for paralyzed\/disabled
individuals.  This technology would also be beneficial to the fire and
rescue workers in increasing firefighter stamina and recovering trapped

        "topic_name": "Advanced Transparent Armor Materials and
Manufacturing Methods",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this feasibility
study is to develop innovative transparent armor for Ground Mobility
Vehicles (GMV) that is lighter than existing transparent armor and that
is affordable. Develop innovative transparent armor that is at least 25%
 lighter at a given protection level and in the current space claim than
 current transparent armor in GMV. The cost of the innovative armor
should be no more than twice the cost of a current flat panel purchased
in a lot of 500 (estimated at $230.00 per panel). The flat panel
technology should be scalable into a curved armor panel as well, with a
projected cost of not more than 8 times the flat innovative panel in a
similar size.    DESCRIPTION: Compared to opaque armor, transparent
armor used to make current ballistic glass is much heavier. Current
advanced transparent armor is much lighter, but also much more
expensive. Use of transparent armor in some form or fashion is
necessitated by the need for a vehicles crew to achieve and maintain
maximum situational awareness (SA). Development of new transparent
solutions that provide significant weight reductions at an affordable
cost will allow current vehicles to: 1) carry more payload in all
vehicle classes and 2) reduce the visual signature in Non Standard
Commercial Vehicles (NSCV) if it is also thinner. Additionally, the
logistics burden could be reduced due to less fuel being required to
operate the lighter vehicles and less weight in stocking and
transporting replacement ballistic windows. Safety is also enhanced if
transparent armor is applied to door panels reducing the effort needed
to open during a rollover or other emergency egress situations. The
transparent material for this SBIR should be capable of meeting Army
Purchase Description (ATPD) 2352P focused on optimum clarity with the
use of night vision goggles and resistance to environmental weathering.
Controlled environmental and ballistic tests will confirm the
transparent material performance. For this effort, the new transparent
technology must be a direct replacement for the GMV front windshield
with a weight savings goal of 25% at a target cost of no more than twice
 that of the current glass. The new transparent technology also needs to
 be scalable into curved transparent armor of similar size, with the
center of the panel being 2 inches further out than the sides. Specific
consideration for the curved panel needs to consider manufacturing
capability, optical clarity at various view angles, and what durability
or life of the curved panel would be in comparison to a similar flat
panel. Current advanced transparent armor technology has shown that
weight savings of roughly 50% over standard ballistic glass is
achievable but the current exceptional costs of 6 to 10 times that of
glass make it unrealistic for vehicle application. This effort seeks to
bridge that gap by producing a significant reduction in weight, while
being affordable enough to realistically field.    PHASE I: Conduct
feasibility (Technology Readiness Levels), affordability (cost\/square
feet for existing and selected material), environmental suitability
(compliance with Army Purchase Description (ATPD) 2352P in terms of
solar degradation, optical clarity, wear resistance, scalability (for
NSCV and GMV class vehicles) and manufacturability (Manufacturing
Readiness Levels) studies of the recommended transparent material in
curved and flat form. Select a single optimum material to address both
curved and flat applications from the feasibility studies and design a
flat GMV replacement window and a size representative curved window,
using the design, project weight, manufacturing cost (in 500 unit
quantities). Also analyze the expected ballistic performance of the
transparent material and predict the level of small arms protection it
will offer. Develop a should cost assessment of manufacturing costs in
500 unit quantity lots for both curved and flat panels.    The objective
 of this USSOCOM Phase I SBIR effort is to conduct and document the
results of a thorough feasibility study to investigate what is in the

transparent armor material in a standard ballistic testing
configuration. Validate agreed upon ballistic, optical, Night Vision
Goggle (NVG), environmental performance in accordance with ATPD 2352P
(see reference).      PHASE III DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III
military applications include replacement of any heavy ballistic glass
solutions currently in GMV"s via attrition. Alternate applications
include upgrades to current vehicles to increase the viewing area in a
vehicle without increasing the current weight of the vehicle.  Civilian
sector applications include armored cars for dignitaries, business

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a low cost, light weight
armor package that has reduced visual signature while offering high
protection against threats for Non Standard Commercial Vehicles (NSCV).
   DESCRIPTION:  Modified commercial vehicles are a staple of Special
Operations activities.  One reason a commercial vehicle is used is to
blend in with local vehicles. They serve a purpose of enabling advance
mobility platforms access to sensitive or denied areas while operating
undetected and\/or indistinguishably from indigenous platforms.  At the
same time as remaining inconspicuous, it is necessary to include
protection to allow the vehicle and Operators to engage in activity as
needed to accomplish the mission which may include the need for an
armored vehicle with mobility allowing fast movement over terrain
considered impassable.  Traditional armor consists of individually
formed plates attached together underneath the vehicle sheet metal.
This method can lead to seams and joints where ballistic coverage may be
 compromised.  It can also add difficulty to making the vehicle look
like its indigenous counterparts.  This SBIR topic seeks innovative
light weight armor packages for NSCVs that are low in cost, reduce
vehicle visual signatures, and provide increased vehicle functionality
and available space.    PHASE I:  Conduct a feasibility study to develop
 low cost, light weight armor package alternatives that reduce visual
signatures while offering high protection against threats (see
reference) for NSCVs.  Assess and determine viable armor solutions that
can be applied to a NSCV, highlighting the manufacturing and
installation processes and the system enhancements the armor solution
will provide in terms of weight, space, cost, visual signature, threat
performance and functionality.  Comparison of the proposed solutions
against current standard armoring solutions will be conducted and
documented to show the pros and cons of the innovative armor in a
vehicle sized application.      The objective of this USSOCOM Phase I

solution in an NSCV, including drawings and Computer Aided Design.
Installation instructions will be created to illustrate that the
solution can be retrofitted into a NSCV.  Manufacture and ballistically
test armor coupon prototypes to validate that the selected solution can
meet the current threats the NSCV"s are designed against.  Acquire a
NSCV equivalent vehicle, manufacture a full vehicle kit of armor and
perform a full vehicle installation of the armor kit.  All projected
enhancements from Phase I will be validated or updated based on the
actual results identified in Phase II to quantify in detail the benefits
 (and any impacts) of the new system.    PHASE III DUAL-USE
APPLICATIONS:  Partner with the current Special Operations Forces (SOF)
NSCV manufacturer to embed the armor into future SOF NSCVS.

economy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and minimizing fuel costs
associated with Military vehicles is a necessity given dwindling budgets
 and the ability to affect significant savings through operational
efficiencies.  One of the easiest and most cost effective ways to
achieve this is through the use of alternative fuels\/technology that
can fully or partially replace petroleum derived fuels using existing

quantify results.  Report on the electrical energy and costs required to
 produce hydrogen from water on site, including equipment weight and

Reconnaissance (ISR) platform.     DESCRIPTION:  Manned ISR platform
operators need to strike a balance between operational factors. They
must fly close enough to collect the mission data while maintaining
sufficient stand-off such that awareness of their presence does not
compromise their ability to collect those data. Due to cost
considerations, replacement of the aircraft engine is not an acceptable
solution. Rather, the innovative technology developed must minimize the
acoustic signature of the King Air - 350ER (B - 300ER).    PHASE I:
Conduct a feasibility study to identify primary sources of acoustic
signatures on the King Air - 350ER (B - 300ER) manned ISR platform and
develop innovative active and passive noise suppression technologies to
reduce the acoustical footprint of the platform. Phase I should result
in the development of active and passive noise suppression technologies
(examples include: innovative propeller designs and materials to reduce
tip speed, modifications of or structural attachments to the exhaust,
acoustic insulation materials, innovative materials at engine bay,
internal engine design modifications and  engine\/aircraft interface
designs) to attenuate\/mitigate\/cancel noise signature of the King Air -
 350ER (B - 300ER) manned ISR platform such that the projected audible
footprint on the ground is minimized. Minimize the acoustic footprint
when the platform operates at relevant altitudes (7,500 feet to 15,000
feet Above Ground Level) to support potential Full Motion Video. Assume
the MX-15i as the baseline sensor system.     The objective of this
USSOCOM Phase I SBIR effort is to conduct and document the results of a
thorough feasibility study to investigate what is in the art of the
possible within the given trade space that will satisfy a needed
technology. The feasibility study should investigate all known options
that meet or exceed the minimum performance parameters specified in this
 write up. It should also address the risks and potential payoffs of the
 innovative technology options that are investigated and recommend the
option that best achieves the objective of this technology pursuit. The
funds obligated on the resulting Phase I SBIR contracts are to be used
for the sole purpose of conducting a thorough feasibility study using
scientific experiments and laboratory studies as necessary. Operational
prototypes will not be developed with USSOCOM SBIR funds during Phase I
feasibility studies. Operational prototypes developed with other than
SBIR funds that are provided at the end of Phase I feasibility studies
will not be considered in deciding what firm(s) will be selected for
Phase II.    PHASE II:  Develop a prototype to demonstrate that the
feasible active and passive noise suppression technologies discovered
during Phase I are achievable.     PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:
Partner with the airframe and engine manufacturers to embed the feasible
 active and passive noise suppression technologies into the King Air
350ER (B  300ER) platform.  All DoD Components, State and Federal
agencies that use aviation platforms to conduct ISR operations can
benefit from the development of noise suppression technologies.",

Initiatives (NRI).    OBJECTIVE: Develop and use biometrics that
provides feedback about the status of human-machine team in autonomous
systems.     DESCRIPTION: Intense workload and short deadlines place a
great deal of stress on warfighters applying computer systems to
complete their mission. Biometric techniques show promise for detecting
variations in human workload, stress, fatigue, and engagement when these
 systems are in the testing and evaluation stages of development (Bonner
 &amp; Wilson, 2002; Murai, Okazaki, &amp; Hayashi, 2004; Hockey,
Gaillard, &amp; Burov, 2004). Health monitoring systems could use
biometric data collected for to make informed decisions about the human
operator's condition (Carter, Cheuvront, Sawka, 2004). Having detected
these factors, the software could provide a human impairment profile to
better address the human's interaction with the proposed autonomous
system. The new sensors must minimize interference with the warfighter's
 ability to complete the testing sessions or mission. For example the
sensors cannot require excessive apparatus or a lengthy calibration
training period.     Both psychophysiology and affective computing have
explored many avenues of research, including speech, facial expressions,
 gestures, central nervous system responses and autonomic nervous system
 responses (Zeng et al., 2009; Calvo and D"Mello, 2010). Among these,
autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses such as cardiorespiratory and
electrodermal responses hold a great deal of promise in physiological
computing since they can be measured more cheaply, quickly and
unobtrusively than central nervous system responses.    PHASE I:
Identify or design sensors that can unobtrusively monitor human
operators for human state assessment with a quantifiable impact on task
performance. Design a sensor system and provide proof-of-concept
supporting data on the ability of said design to accurately assess the
cognitive state of engineers during test activities.     PHASE II:
Prototype the designed sensor system. Demonstrate that sensor
information improves human operator cognitive state assessment and can
lead to improved performance and productivity during test engineering
activities. Develop prototype mobile application to facilitate the
cognitive state assessment in operational environments.     PHASE III:
Fully developed cognitive state assessment systems that have numerous
applications relevant to the Department of Defense, especially where
fatigue or information overload are responsible for elevated error
rates. Industry applications include operation and safety in areas such
as transportation, energy and medicine.",

Learning-enabled Systems",
        "description": "This topic is supported under National Robotics
Initiatives (NRI).    OBJECTIVE: Develop methodology to evaluate and
measure the performance and progress for learning enabled systems.
DESCRIPTION: A long term goal of machine learning is to develop systems
that learn complex behaviors with minimal human oversight. However,
future systems that incorporate learning strategies will not necessarily
 have a fixed software state that can be evaluated by the testing
community. In some cases, most of the training occurs in the development
 process using large databases of training examples.  Testing may
involve a series of challenge scenarios, similar to the DARPA autonomous
 mobility challenges, designed to examine the performance of the
system-under-test in relevant conditions.  Design of the scenarios and
performance metrics are open research questions.     As autonomous
systems are used in increasingly complex scenarios, supervised training
during the development phase, by itself, may not be sufficient to allow
the system to learn the appropriate behavior. Learning from
demonstration uses examples, often supplied by the end-user of the
system, to train the system.  Examples include flying in specific
environments, bi-pedal locomotion on different terrain surfaces and,
throwing objects of different sizes or densities.  In this case, the
tester needs to stand in for the end user and"train"the systems before
testing it.  Test procedures need to evaluate not only the performance
of the system in various scenarios, but the amount of time it takes to
train the system and the required level of expertise for
the"expert"trainer.      Finally, some applications include continuously
 adapting models that adjust over time to compensate for changes in the
environment or mission.  Current research is exploring the use of
on-line learning in areas such as terrain adaptive mobility and
perception. This case presents a particularly challenging evaluation
problem, performance in a given scenario is not static  it may improve
over time.     In this solicitation we seek a methodology that answers
the following three questions:  a) What is an appropriate testing
methodology for learning-enabled systems?   This includes testing
procedures that apply to systems with supervised learning components, as
 well as user-trained or continuously adapting systems.  b)  Are there
general testing principles that can be applied to learning-enabled
systems regardless of the specific applications?  c) Can we predict the
evolution of a learning-enabled system over time?  For adaptive systems,
 can we predict how much time is required to adapt to a new environment?
 What are the potential impacts on military autonomous systems?    PHASE
 I: The first phase consists of initial methodology development, metrics
 and a set of use cases to evaluate and measure the performance of
learning-enabled systems.  This methodology must address supervised,
re-trained and continuously adaptive systems.  Documentation of the
methodology and use cases is required in the final report.    PHASE II:
Prototype the methodology by using it to examine test cases for each
type of learning-enabled system in simulated test environments.  The
prototypes should address the 3 questions states above.   Deliverables
shall include the prototype system and a final report, which shall
contain documentation of all activities in the project and a user's
guide and technical specifications for the prototype system.    PHASE
III: Fully developed systems that evaluate the performance
learning-enabled systems in either real or simulated scenarios.
Potential commercial applications could be a system that to assess the
performance of autonomous driving systems, logistics systems, and
autonomous UAV applications such as power line inspection in which the
UAV must adapt its flight parameters to changing wind characteristics.
Deliverables shall include the methodology, test case scenarios and some
 general principles that the test and evaluation community can use to
develop test procedures for specific systems.",

        "topic_name": "Evaluating Mixed Human\/Robot Team Performance",
        "description": "This topic is supported under National Robotics
Initiatives (NRI).    OBJECTIVE: Develop methodology to evaluate mixed
human\/robot team performance    DESCRIPTION: Introducing robotic assets
 to a military or civilian unit should increase the level of performance
 for the team. We evaluate human teams by scoring their performance on
specific tasks; they can be a single score for the team, or an aggregate
 of individual member scores. Likewise, we need to extend this idea to
tasks performed by mixed teams. The conceptual team can be a single
human acting as"robot operator or handler"and a single robot. However,
of equal important is the team of multiple humans with one or more
robots. Evaluation of the human component performance, the robot
component performance, and the mixed team performance is critical in
both T &amp; E settings, where meeting performance thresholds will be
key, as well as research environments where identification of weaknesses
 will assist in advancing the technology. Unfortunately, evaluation of a
 mixed human\/robot team performance is much more complicated and
complex than a human only team evaluation. In addition, mission space of
 a mixed human\/robot team may be different than that of a human only
team  in some ways the mission space may be more limited (e.g., terrain
may limited robot mobility); in other ways, the mission space may be
expanded (e.g., through additional sensor capabilities).    There is a
wide range of scenarios in which human-robot teams may increase overall
mission performance. Some examples of possible scenarios include some
combat operations (both mounted and dismounted) such as reconnaissance;
installation personnel transport; construction; road clearance;
logistics; and, medical evacuation. These scenarios will require certain
 tasks to be performed by the human-robot team members, in various
environments, to certain expected levels of performance.    In this
solicitation, we are looking for a methodology and\/or algorithm that
can answer the following three questions:  a) What are appropriate lists
 of tasks, in what environments, for a mixed human\/robot team? This
would include defining different kinds of military or civilian
human\/robot teams, with differing capabilities, and expected
performance characteristics?  b) Are there techniques\/methodologies
that can evaluate the performance of the robotic asset(s) within the
team mission? Are there techniques\/methodologies that can evaluate the
combined performance of robots and humans in the team mission?  c) How
does performance on scenario-based task\/environment\/capability
combinations relate to additional, new combinations (can we use the
techniques\/methodologies to establish performance envelopes across a
range of scenarios and unmanned systems?)    PHASE I: Determine the
feasibility of developing a methodology and\/or algorithm to evaluate
and measure a mixed human\/robot team performance. From the scenarios
above (or identify others) where human-robot teams are likely to
increase mission effectiveness, choose two to three scenarios to use as
developmental scenarios. Within the chosen scenarios: 1) Identify
potential military human\/robot team characteristics, 2) identify
possible tasks that the robot\/human\/team will perform (both
scenario\/mission specific and general\/universal), 3) define
environment characteristics that will impact robot\/human\/team
performance, and identify potential and appropriate robot\/human\/team
performance measurement metrics. From this large matrix space
(scenario\/team\/task\/environment\/metrics), identify one or more
methodologies and\/or algorithms for assessing mixed human\/robot team
performance. Documentation of methodology tradeoffs and projected
methodology strengths and weaknesses shall be required in the final
report.    PHASE II: Define in detail and prototype the methodology(ies)
 and\/or algorithm(s). Test the methodology(ies) and or algorithm(s) in
real or simulated scenarios, with particular attention to validated (or
defensibly appropriate) models of robot and human performance.
Demonstrate the feasibility of the answers to the above three questions.
 Define methods to valid the solution set.  Show applicability across a
range of scenarios (i.e., not just the scenarios chosen in Phase I). In
addition, the final product of Phase II should be able to evaluate and
compare team performance between a human only team and a mixed
human\/robot team. Deliverables shall include the prototype
methodology(ies) and\/or algorithms and a final report, which shall
contain documentation of all activities in the project and detailed
instructions for using the prototype approach.    PHASE III: The final
product is expected to be fully developed systems that can evaluate the
performance of any combination of human only teams and mixed
human\/robot teams.  Potential military applications would be by the
Test and Evaluation community for use in determining the performance
envelope of candidate systems or in the research community for use in
describing performance in R &amp; D.  Potential commercial applications
could be for robotic systems developed to assess performance during
system development across a range of applications or by commercial
enterprises interested in developing and assessing autonomous driving.",

        "topic_name": "Safety Testing for Autonomous Systems in
Simulation",
        "description": "This topic is supported under National Robotics
Initiatives (NRI).    OBJECTIVE: The Army is interested in adding
autonomy to its vehicle convoys [1], but how can we certify that these
autonomous algorithms are safe?  Currently, live testing of full vehicle
 systems is the only acceptable method, but even after hundreds of hours
 of successful live testing, a single hidden failure point in the
algorithms would disprove the hypothesis that the proposed autonomous
system is safe.  Furthermore, live testing can be cost prohibitive, and
is (not surprisingly) far from exhaustive.  Instead, we seek to develop a
 safety testing environment (STE) that will exercise our current
autonomy algorithms with software\/hardware in the loop in parallel with
 live testing that will validate the STE.    DESCRIPTION:  Recent
advancements in sensor simulation tools [2] have improved our ability to
 model radar, lidar, camera, and GPS with software\/hardware in the
loop.  Of course, our ability to model the physics of heavy trucks [3]
is quite mature as well.  To address the challenge of developing the
STE, we will provide our autonomy algorithms as Government Furnished
Equipment (GFE).      The focus of this topic is: 1) to build an
environment that mirrors actual test data to provide a departure point
for Monte Carlo simulations. 2) research the failure modes for autonomy
algorithms within the capabilities of current sensor models and 3)
simulate the corner cases that would exercise these failure modes.
This topic is not focused on improving physics-based simulation of heavy
 trucks or building better sensor models.  Neither do we seek to develop
 new algorithms for autonomous behavior, but rather to leverage existing
 GFE autonomy algorithms to study the open research question of how we
can test these algorithms in simulation, and certify that they are safe
to the fullest extent possible within current simulation environments.
  PHASE I:  In Phase I we seek a System Architecture for the Safety
Testing Environment (STE).  This prototype STE may be outlined with
cursory autonomy algorithms rather than with the GFE algorithms.  Define
 sensor models, processor and software requirements.  Propose metrics
for highlighting the impact and reliability of the STE.  Provide a
detailed concept of operations (CONOPS) and overview (OV) graphics.
PHASE II: Integrate GFE algorithms into a fully functional STE of an
operationally relevant scenario such collision mitigation braking,
adaptive cruise control, or lane departure, etc.  We desire a model of a
 M915 or Marine Corps AMK23 Cargo Truck for the STE.  Demonstrate the
effectiveness of this STE within the metrics defined in Phase I.  The
STE should be able to simulate ambient noise, sunlight, occlusions
between the following and leading vehicle and fully simulate radar,
lidar, camera and GPS.  The objective is a full military environment.
 PHASE III: Work to have the proposed system become a part of the AMAS
program.",

        "topic_name": "Distributed Visual Surveillance for Unmanned
Ground Vehicles",
        "description": "This topic is supported under National Robotics
Initiatives (NRI).    OBJECTIVE:  Develop a system to identify,
classify, and analyze visual data from unmanned ground vehicles and
stationary visual surveillance sources to enable real-time on-board
decisions and system-wide planning regarding route, speed, and tasks.
 DESCRIPTION:  Distributed visual surveillance has a major role in the
future of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV"s).  Distributed visual
surveillance refers to the use of cameras networked over a wide area to
continually collect and process sensor data to recognize and classify
objects in the environment.  Analyzed data will inform unmanned
decision-making and fleet management to optimize a transportation
system.  Sensors and camera systems mounted on UGVs will augment
stationary surveillance hardware.  An area of interest for this research
 is data fusion, co-operative multi-sensor tracking methods, and
distributed processing.  Also of interest is the reconciliation,
classification, and prioritization of data; storage and accurate
retrieval of archival references; and the selection of an appropriate
action\/response to the data.        Although there are many potential
sensors that can be used in distributed surveillance, in this topic we
are focusing on visual (and perhaps infrared) imaging sensors whose
cost, reliability, and availability makes transition to the field or
commercialization much more likely. Communications bandwidth is and will
 remain a limited resource.  Even with video compression technologies,
there is insufficient bandwidth to upload all video and high-resolution
still images from all network nodes.  Artifacts due to heavy video
compression would degrade most analysis applications and viewing all the
 data would overwhelm analysts.  Local processing is therefore
preferable to central processing to extract actionable information from
the sensor data and to plan UGV position adjustments.  An individual
node can determine whether or not there has been a significant change in
 the situation that would warrant transmitting a package of sensor-level
 data.     The scenario to be addressed in this topic is that a small
fleet of 10-15 UGVs deployed at a CONUS installation in order to safely
transport personnel, on-demand, from various point around one building
one-third mile sharing pedestrian sidewalk, across an uncontrolled
four-lane roadway, through a busy parking lot to another building on the
 installation.  Vehicles will operate at speeds from 3mph (in mixed
pedestrian traffic) up to potentially 25mph which is the limit for
Neighbourhood Electric Vehicles.  Vehicles must recognize and respond
appropriately to pedestrians, unconnected vehicles, and other
environmental objects.  Approximately 12 networked cameras fixed across
along the route and around the test site will provide visual coverage of
 the area.  Sensors will have a priori visual background data and UGV
location will be known (landmarks, GPS positioning, etc.) enabling
temporal differential or background subtraction to locate objects.
Capabilities desired for the UGV include ODOA, correct positioning and
speed regulation with respect to moving and stationary objects,
coordinated and optimized system-wide responses across the fleet, data
collection and\/or communications, and extracting actionable information
 from the sensor stream.  Information of interest includes detection and
 behaviour analysis of humans and vehicles, analysis of traffic
patterns, and identification of suspicious activities or behaviors.  The
 intended platform is an electric vehicle with size on the order of
500-600 Kg (roughly golf-cart sized).  The platform is expected to
manage its own energy usage and recharge itself, wirelessly, so energy
efficient algorithms are of interest. UGV platform and payload
development, including sensors and communications, are outside the scope
 of this topic.    PHASE I:  The first phase consists of
scenario\/capability selection, initial system design, researching
sensor options, investigating signal and video processing algorithms,
and showing feasibility on sample data.  Documentation of design
tradeoffs and projected system performance shall be required in the
final report.    PHASE II:  The second phase consists of a final design
and full implementation of the system, including sensors and UGV
software.  At the end of the contract, a database of behavioural
characteristics will be available enabling both improved M &amp; S and T
 &amp; E as well as improved autonomous local maneuvering shall be
demonstrated in a realistic outdoor environment.  Deliverables shall
include the prototype system and a final report, which shall contain
documentation of all activities in the project and a user's guide and
technical specifications for the prototype system.    PHASE III:  The
end-state of this research is to further develop the prototype system
and potentially transition the system to the field or for use on
military installations and bases. Potential military applications
include monitoring highways, overpasses, intersections, buildings and
security checkpoints.  Potential commercial applications include
monitoring high profile events, border security and commercial and
residential surveillance. The most likely path for transition of the
SBIR from research to operational capability is through collaboration
with robotic companies from industry or through collaboration with the
Robotic Systems Joint Project Office (RS JPO).",

        "topic_name": "Obfuscation to Thwart Un-Trusted Hardware",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop innovative methods for
mutating or obfuscating the processes of network security appliances or
tactical communication systems. To make the path of the processes and
data through hardware non deterministic, thereby thwarting any supply
chain attacks that rely on the deterministic nature of computing to
exfiltrate data and compromise operations. To mask the data and
processes such that information exfiltrated from compromised hardware is
 not useful to an adversary.    DESCRIPTION: With more and more of the
hardware that the U.S. Army relies on for critical communications and
security being manufactured in whole or in part in countries not
sympathetic to the goals of this Nation, supply chain tampering is of a
greater and greater concern. Tampering with components as they are
produced can have catastrophic effect. From a security perspective, the
possibility of supply chain attacks undermines the trust that can be
placed on a system. Supply chain attacks can involve the insertion of
hardware modules or embedded code into hardware devices. These
insertions can exfiltrate data or allow backdoor access into systems by
the parties responsible for their insertion. Detecting these insertions
is costly and difficult, especially with many components coming from
many places; all of which could have any of these types of insertions.
These inserted modules rely on the user being unaware of their presence,
 and performing tasks in a predictable manner.     The aspect of a
predictable manner is very important to the developers of the supply
chain attacks. In the case of network security appliances, the
hardware"s intended use is known at the time of manufacture, and its use
 can easily be predicted. In many cases the behavior of the software is
very well known, and its path through the hardware can easily be
predicted. This can give the adversary easy access to usernames,
passwords, and data that should be encrypted. It can also provide the
adversary with the means to stealthily bypass the security features on
the system. If network security appliance or tactical communication
system processes and data can be masked or modified in such a way that
if exfiltrated it is no longer useful, or even harmful, to the adversary
 it will restore trust to the system. If the processes can be rerouted
through the hardware, such that its path is unpredictable, these
malicious insertions would no longer be able to reliably exfiltrate
useful data, or attack processes.    Developing a means of restoring
trust by the software architecture is a novel idea. It will lead to a
more secure computing environment, because we will be able to place more
 trust in the systems. It will also prevent the cost of construction and
 operating new and trusted computer components manufacturing facilities,
 or embedding inspectors at factories around the world.    PHASE I:
Define software architecture that would be compatible with network
appliance and\/or tactical communication hardware that would enable
security applications or tactical communication systems to operate in a
trusted manner on hardware assumed to be untrusted. Describe and develop
 creative methods, techniques, and tools that would allow for the
implementation of such an architecture.    PHASE II: Develop, implement
and validate a prototype system that utilizes the architecture, tools,
and methods from Phase I. The prototypes should be sufficiently detailed
 to evaluate scalability, usability, and resistance to malicious attack.
 Efficiency is also an issue that should be explored, although it is
less critical than overall scalability.    PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: The increasingly global market for computer hardware will
continue to put the production of hardware in places not sympathetic to
the United States Military or commercial sector. This application will
have a broad market in the commercial sector as well where the
protection of intellectual property is becoming increasingly
difficult.",

        "topic_name": "Detecting Malicious Circuits in IP-Core",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop technologies and tools for
detecting potential malicious\/backdoor logics in hardware IP-core,
toward reducing supply-chain vulnerability in embedded computing and
system on chip environment.    DESCRIPTION: This topic solicits the
development of technologies and tools which perform analysis on
gate-level netlist of hardware IP-core to identify potentially malicious
 wires and logics, related to hardware backdoors. Compromise at hardware
 level is very powerful, difficult to detect and generally not
addressable via software running on it. The solicited tool can be used
to screen, detect and disqualify components\/IP-cores which contain
backdoor circuitry.     Tactical computing devices often rely on the
system-on-chip embedded computing hardware commonly found in embedded
computing devices, often used in mobile computing and networking
appliances, as the underlying processing infrastructure. Modern large
and complex embedded and system-on-chip (VLSI\/FPGA circuit) design
often integrates large number of pre-designed components, acquired from
third parties. These IP-core components are generally delivered as
gate-level netlist. Currently, there is no practical way to ensure that
these third party components (IP-cores) do not contain any backdoor or
malicious circuitry, which can stealthily compromise the design (system)
 after deployment. Compromise circuitry embedded within the hardware is
generally very hard to detect and defeat.     State of the art
methodology for verifying VLSI design includes running unit test on the
individual component, as well as performing comprehensive regression
test on the full-chip (VLSI) design. However, these tests can only
address functionality described in the specifications. They rarely
uncover the stealthy, out-of-specification malicious logics, which can
only be triggered (activated), by hidden, rare and very-specific
occasions. A new approach is needed to uncover these elusive circuits.
  If successful, the tools developed in this SBIR can be used to screen
these third party IP-cores to ensure that they do not contain any
backdoor\/malicious logic. They prevent compromised IP-cores from being
integrated into the design and enhance the security of the system.
PHASE I: Investigate and develop creative methods, techniques for
reliably discovering malicious\/backdoor logics in hardware IP-core,
normally delivered in the form of gate-level-netlist. Develop proof of
concept prototype and identify the metrics that determine the
prototype"s efficacy.     PHASE II: Develop and enhance the prototype

of the tool on actual (real world scale) set of benign IP-Cores and
IP-cores with malicious-circuit\/ backdoor.     PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: Inclusion of third party IP-cores is a common practice in
system-on-chip design and development in private sector and in military
industry. These SOCs hardware have been the backbones for embedded and
mobile computing devices in the commercial sector as well as in the
military uses. System-on-chip (SOC) hardware (semiconductors) is widely
used in commercial application such as network appliances and mobile
computing. Security and financial motive for the insertion malicious
circuits exists in these applications. Commercial chip
provider\/manufacturers have interest for ensuring that their product is
 free of malicious circuits. If successful the tool developed within
this SBIR should find its market in the commercial sector as well as
military sector.",

identification of biological toxins",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Design, develop and demonstrate
concepts that will provide ability to detect and discriminate among
various biological toxins that are identified threat agents. Particular
emphasis is on disposable, low cost devices suited to in-field
application. The solution should overcome limitations of present
immunoassay-based detection schemes.     DESCRIPTION: The concept is
intended to provide means that help identify and further avoid
individual"s exposure to select threat agents and identify contaminated
materials. A specific interest is the identification of plant-derived
toxins such as ricin. Ricin and related molecules are classic biological
 warfare agents as well as common threats delivered in rouge terror
attacks via contaminated mail or other crude dissemination methods.
The DoD, along with other government and civilian operations, require
the ability to continuously monitor for general threats and then rapidly
 screen and identify threat and risk when a primary monitor is
triggered. A cost-effective and reliable primary screen for biological
toxin threats that can be used for field tests and may be integrated in
fixed, continuous monitoring platforms is a highly desirable technology.
 Samples that trigger preliminary screen could then be passed to more
precise and complex assessments to confirm and identify threat. The
research is expected to develop materials which, will selectively
interact and allow presumptive identification of biologically-derived
toxins. Contemporary advances in biotechnology and materials science
provide many approaches to integrate biological processes into sensor,
forensic, and diagnostic processes. The proposed work should take
advantage of current state-of-art methodologies to develop materials
concepts that allow presumptive identification of threat agents and are
versatile enough for application in hand-held portable test-kits as well
 as high-throughput, continuously operating monitors. The ideal design
will be low cost and will readily integrate with
commercial-off-the-shelf electronic equipment. The readout should be
easy to interpret, and amenable to potentially monitor for numerous
toxins simultaneously. The sensing modality will provide alternatives to
 existing antibody-based sensing and screening technologies.    PHASE I:
 Combine innovative approaches for modification\/functionalization of
readily available materials for identification of plant-derived toxins.
Incorporate material within assay to rigorously evaluate concept for
proof-of-principle. Demonstrate proof of principle in a controlled
laboratory environment. Demonstration will successfully detect and
presumptively identify a single threat agent simulant and discriminate
from a related molecule in laboratory sample. Detection sensitivity must
 be competitive with existing surface plasmon resonance-based
technologies (threshold 200 ng\/mL).     PHASE II: Develop and
demonstrate a hand-held prototype device that incorporates sensor
recognition materials that can be tested in a relevant environment. The
material may be further optimized to monitor or screen for multiple
threats of concern simultaneously by incorporating multiplex concept.
The concept prototype will maintain selectivity for defined toxins
within complex environmental samples (e.g., surface waters, dust,
household chemicals, foodstuff). The system should incorporate materials
 that simultaneously monitor for 3 or more threat agents and maintain
sensitivity (threshold 200 ng\/mL).    PHASE III: The technology
developed under this effort includes development for dual use
applications in military and civilian areas related to operation,
primary threat, and environmental monitoring.",

sensors",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Design and develop a deployable
radio frequency (RF)  based broadband impedance chemical\/biological
detection system suitable for field-deployable networks, UAV deployment
applications, and stand-alone chemical\/biological point detection.
DESCRIPTION:  Chemical-warfare (CW) agents, Biological Warfare (BW)
agents, explosive materials, and toxic industrial chemicals\/materials
(TIC\/TIM) are compounds that can be used as weapons of mass
destructions.  A priority of the DoD Joint Chemical and Biological
Defense Program is development of new and improved chemical and
biological sensors.  To achieve this objective, innovative materials and
 designs will be required. Low-cost, radio frequency (RF) wireless
chemical sensors and biosensors are expected to have significant
applications in defense and homeland security and are ideal for
deployment on micro-unmanned aerial vehicles and used in
field-deployable networks, and for stand-alone point detection. The
outstanding carrier mobility, the excessive large surface area per unit
mass and the adjustable surface chemistry make graphene an excellent
candidate for chemical\/biological sensing.  Most of the graphene-based
chem\/bio-sensing approaches, however, rely on registering the variation
 of either the DC resistance or the electrochemical surface potential.
The major restrictions are chem\/bio molecules usually experience
transformation (e.g. polarization due to the applied high voltage) at DC
 or low frequency, and high background noises.  In addition, the current
 techniques confront a number of challenges in recognition, selectivity,
 spatial resolution and quantification.  At radio frequencies, the
motion of chem\/bio molecules and water masking effects can be largely
suppressed, thus reducing background noise and increasing sensitivity.
Moreover, interfacial capacitance between the target molecule and
graphene surface only becomes pronounced and detectable at RF, providing
 additional information for detection.     This topic seeks new and
innovative approaches to design and develop a deployable radio frequency
 (RF)-based broadband impedance chemical\/biological detection system.
Due to time\/investment constraints in the Phase I\/Phase II SBIR
project period-of-performance, the offeror should focus on
proof-of-concept using chemical agent simulants with an approach that
permits future expansion of the active sensing technology to encompass
biological agents in later phases. Such a system is expected to
outperform conventional sensors in sensitivity, reliability, selectivity
 (false-positive\/false-negative rates), and high-throughput analysis
(rapid response time). Some nerve agents have time-weighted average
exposure limits at sub-ppb concentration; thereby, the proposal should
target sensing CWAs with sensitivity to sub-ppb (by using CWA simulants
in the demonstration.)  Methods that only address the
chemical\/biological agents sensing capability such as conventional
monitoring variation of resistance and electrochemical potential are not
 sufficient to meet the intent of this topic, but could be employed to
achieve the end objective. Functionalization of graphene with
recognition molecules to achieve selective detection of chemical or
biological threat agents is highly desired.  RF transmitter and rectenna
 are needed to be implemented in the system to transmit detected
information wirelessly.  The system must be easy to use, demonstrate
real-time sensing with sub-ppb detection sensitivity capable of
selective detection (by using a combination of CWA simulants and
interferences, e.g., water vapor) and capable of in-situ multiplexed
chemical\/biological sensing with no need for sample preparation.  The
system must also be capable of self-recovery, allow prolonged
integration time and continuous monitoring of threat changes in the
environment, and be used outdoors. The prototype system is anticipated
to be readily remote controlled with a high detection probability (PD)
and low false alarm (FA) rate: PD&gt;95% and FA",

        "topic_name": "Micro-electric Technology for Respiratory
Protection Systems",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Design and develop micro-electric
devices suitable for integration into a face or helmet mounted
respiratory protective system.    DESCRIPTION: Military respirators used
 for protection against chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear
(CBRN) threat agents currently have no means to reduce heat and moisture
 burden associated with prolonged respirator wear. Traditional powered
air-purifying blower systems used to supply clean breathing air can
offer significant evaporative cooling and other benefits, such as lens
defogging, but are not suitable for integration due to their excessive
weight, bulk, and power requirements. Similarly, state-of-the-art
technologies for vapor-compression heat pumps and thermoelectric devices
 are too large, heavy and\/or power-hungry for practical application;
and passive technology for heat and moisture adsorption such as phase
change materials, wicking materials, and heat pipes has proven
ineffective.     Innovative micro-electric systems with sensor feedback
technologies are sought to improve comfort and performance of military
respirators while minimizing size, weight and power demand in order to
make them practical for military use. Specific example applications
include but are not limited to: (1) anti-fog management that provides
rapid clearing of eye lenses including high work rates in basic cold
conditions (see MIL-STD-810G, 31 Oct 2008); (2) air-management solutions
 including on-demand miniature blowers and humidity control devices that
 can generate sufficient airflow (e.g. 20 to 30 Liters\/min, minimum)
and low-power requirements (e.g. less than 5 watts); (3) breathing-air
management systems to maintain proper air quality (i.e. proper oxygen
and carbon dioxide levels) and extend mission range\/time of respirators
 for high-hazard environments that include Self-Contained Breathing
Apparatuses (SCBA) and Closed-Circuit (CC) SCBA configurations; (4)
breathing and thermal management systems responsive to physiological
monitoring.     The devices must be intrinsically safe, hygienic,
durable, and easy to clean. The devices should be able to be integrated
with the existing military or applicable commercial respirators, should
be lightweight (less than 50 grams), and should not degrade or otherwise
 adversely impact the vision or the flexibility and sealing quality
(e.g., fit or protection factor performance) of the mask. The devices
and components, including their housings, must be rugged and able to
withstand a wide range of temperature and environmental extremes.
PHASE I: Develop an innovative micro-electric system and demonstrate the
 feasibility of designing and fabricating a"bread-board"system.
Demonstrate robustness of the control system to sense the targeted
environmental and\/or physiological states and maintain the desired
performance over the targeted range of operational conditions.
Demonstrate that the device can be miniaturized and meet power demand
objectives. Produce an objective prototype design and estimate, size,
weight, power demand, cost, and net benefit of the production item.
PHASE II: Refine and optimize Phase I bread-board micro-electric system.
 Characterize prototype performance using a suitable respirator system
as a test bed. Optimize test bed performance and demonstrate the
micro-electric system(s) by assessing and validating performance under
an operational relevant range of external environmental
(temperature\/humidity) conditions, in-mask heat\/humidity loads, and
operationally relevant breathing rates. Develop and demonstrate that the
 devices including sensors, processing, power and communications can be
miniaturized where total weight of the entire system to include housing
and electronics should not exceed 50 grams. Demonstrate the technology
can quickly identify repeated changes in conditions occurring in the
same region. Develop ability to store baseline conditions acquired
during wear and that data can be communicated for external monitoring
and analysis. Develop and demonstrate technology to warn user of
changing conditions and\/or differences from the baseline. Provide
pre-production prototypes of respirators with embedded micro-electric
technology. Demonstrate the feasibility of these sensors to be
miniaturized and to operate in temperature and moisture extremes.
PHASE III: Fully integrate solution into a military CBRN-protective
respirator system. Optimize fabrication process to demonstrate
large-scale production capabilities and to demonstrate ability of
technology to be incorporated into multiple mask systems. Demonstrate
the ability to commercialize the technology and establish partners to
expand commercialization.    PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Potential
alternative applications include industrial, international, and
commercial respiratory protection systems (e.g., firefighting helmets,
HAZMAT response ensembles, etc.).",

        "topic_name": "DNA Origami-based Bio-scavengers for Nerve Agent
Sequestration",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Design and develop DNA origami-based
bio-scavengers with high affinity for organophosphorus compounds and
demonstrate these systems can be optimized for use in the molecular
sequestration of nerve agents.     DESCRIPTION: The DOD has the need for
 a universal organophosphorus (OP) scavenger that will protect against
multiple OP compounds, including all existing nerve agents. The ideal
scavenger should be rapid, irreversible, and specific and have a
prolonged circulation time in the bloodstream. The ideal scavenger
should also be biologically innocuous in the absence of OP compounds. In
 particular the optimum scavenger should not stimulate an immune
response. Scavengers can also be used prophylactically by inactivating
OP compounds before they can react with the target acetcylcholinesterase
 (AChE).     In biological systems, avidity is often used to describe
the combined strength of multiple bond interactions. Avidity is distinct
 from affinity, which is a term used to describe the strength of a
single bond. Avidity is the combined synergistic strength of bond
affinities rather than the sum of bonds. Avidity is commonly applied to
antibody interactions in which multiple binding sites simultaneously
interact with a target molecule. When many binding interactions are
present at the same time, transient unbinding of a single site does not
allow the molecule to diffuse away, and binding of that site is likely
to be reinstated. It has been demonstrated multiple binding sites can
increase the effective binding of a molecular species by up to five
orders of magnitude relative to the affinity of any univalent bond
within the system. A DNA origami structure may have up to 250 binding
sites on a single moiety. This presents a powerful platform for
molecular sequestration.     Current treatment of OP poisoning involves a
 combination of therapies. Drugs such as atropine are administered to
counteract the effects of acetylcholine. An oxime such as pralidoxime
reacts with the inhibited cholinesterase, removing the organophosphate
from cholinesterase. The cholinesterase is then able to resume normal
function. Anticonvulsant drugs such as diazepam are used to control
tremors and convulsions. These therapies are effective in preventing
death. However, performance deficits, behavioral incapacitation, loss of
 consciousness, and potential permanent brain damage can occur in the
absence of further treatment. An effective bioscavenger that can reduce
the concentration of all OP"s to low levels (less than one micromolar)
in a short period of time (less than 2 minutes) would provide DOD
personnel with needed protection from the harmful defects of nerve agent
 exposure.     Intravenous (IV) plasma derived butyrylcholinesterase
(hBuChE) is a very effective bioscavenger that has been shown to provide
 protection from lethal exposure to nerve agent using animal models.
However, hBuChE is logistically difficult to use in battle field
scenarios since it typically requires refrigeration. Attempts have been
made to lyophilize hBuChE. However, reconstituted hBuChE shows a
considerable loss in activity. Furthermore, hBuChE is perishable, and a
constant supply can only be maintained with on-going blood donations.
Butryrlcholinesterase can also be produced using recombinant methods
(rBuChE). However, rBuChE has been shown to be less effective than
hBuChE. In general protein folding is unpredictable and difficult to
control. Lyophilization and reconstitution can produce unpredictable
results. Proteins are perishable and tend to be very immunogenic. Hence,
 a non-protein-based bio-scavenger may provide significant advantages
for treating nerve agent exposure.    Recent advances in DNA-based
origami and hybrid DNA-based nanostructures that combine origami
construction with designer motifs offer a new bio-technological pathway
to man-engineered bio-scavengers. DNA origami is the folding of DNA
strands into 2D or 3D, and DNA motifs may be utilized to array
individual DNA origami units into even larger and more complex
bio-nanostructures. In a DNA origami, a long single-stranded plasmid
DNA, like M13mp18 ssDNA, can be folded into a space-filling curve and
held in place with shorter"staple"strands, which crosslink and stabilize
 the structure, enabling the formation of complex 2D and 3D shapes. The
molecular weight of a typical DNA origami structure (e.g., based on
M13mp18) can be over 2M daltons with a relatively large surface area,
which can be decorated with multiple precisely addressed molecular
recognition units. Theoretically, each staple strand can attach to one
molecular recognition unit, which will allow for the capture of up to
250 target molecules by each individual DNA origami construct, and this
number can be multiplied using DNA motif-based arraying techniques.
Therefore, DNA origami-based platforms can present large numbers of
molecular sequestration sites. Furthermore, such DNA-based
bio-scavengers would not elicit a strong immunogenic response. This is
in contrast to proteins where strong immunogenic responses are normal. A
 strong immunogenic response to a scavenger can have very negative
implications. For example, a person can become allergic to
cholinesterase-like molecules that can lead to autoimmune-like symptoms.
     In general, the design of large and diverse DNA-based
nanostructures using naturally occurring genetic components (i.e., using
 only four base pairs) involves a great deal of computational
complexity. Indeed, the task of determining the DNA sequence sets
required for the self-assembly of highly optimized and stable
geometrical forms presently requires the use of specialized algorithms
and distributed computing. While active DOD programs are presently
advancing the state of the art in design automation software for DNA
architectures, the design and associated synthesis problem can be
greatly simplified through the use of expanded DNA alphabets such as
AEGIS (Artificially Expanded Genetic Information System) that uses
twelve nucleic acids in its genetic code. These artificially expanded
DNA systems offer many strategic advantages (e.g., managing
non-canonical forms, more chemically stable, etc.) and can be used to
realize fundamental building blocks that allow for the additional of
clickable functionality (i.e., which could be useful for defining
electro-optical diagnostic techniques for monitoring molecular
sequestration action). The chances of an adverse immune reaction would
also be further reduced through the use of AEGIS type components since
the artificial bases do not exist in nature; it is unlikely that a
person will have future encounters with the artificial structure
produces by these bases. Hence, DNA origami-based platforms that utilize
 hybrid building blocks represent a promising pathway to a novel class
of bio-scavengers for nerve agent sequestration.    PHASE I: Formulate a
 complete design for a bio-scavenger based upon DNA origami components
that sequesters organophosphorous compounds from blood using integrated
molecular capture. It is also strongly recommended that the DNA
origami-based platform be specified so as to incorporate electro-optical
 based diagnostic monitoring of the sequestration process. The scavenger
 should reduce OP"s concentrations to low levels (less than one
micromolar) in a short period of time (less than 2 minutes). The
scavenger should remain in the bloodstream for an extended period of
time (at least 10 days) after administration at levels that provide
protection from OP"s. The scavenger should be non-immunogenic. The
scavenger should be lyophilizable and remain active after
reconstitution. The lyophilized form of the scavenger should be stable
for extended periods of time (at least 2 years at temperatures not
exceeding 50 degrees C). Demonstrate proof of concept and feasibility
using candidate OP binding moiety testing. For demonstration purposed,
is can be assumed that the initial OP concentration can be as high as
one millimolar. An in vitro study of a pesticide or other nerve agent
simulant can be used for proof-of-principle in Phase I.     PHASE II:
Develop and test a DNA origami-based bio-scavenger that achieves the
functionality and performance requirements specified in the Phase I
requirements. It is expected that the bio-scavenger will first be tested
 using OP pesticides and\/or nerve agent simulants. The bio-scavenger
should also be tested against bona fide OP nerve agents. Since testing
with OP nerve agents is required during Phase II development, and as
small business firms are unable to handle and utilize chemical weapon
agents (CWAs), a testing facility approved to utilize these materials
must be identified (it strongly recommended that a qualified DOD
laboratory or appropriately licensed commercial laboratory be identified
 for use in testing against the OP nerve agents).    PHASE III: Research
 and development during Phase III efforts will be directed toward
refining final deployable designs for OP scavengers. In vivo safety and
efficacy testing in animal models will be performed. Design
modifications based on results from tests conducted during Phase II will
 be incorporated. Manufacturability specific to the Joint Chemical and
Biological Defense Program CONOPS and end-user requirements should be
examined. Molecular scavengers will have numerous commercial
applications, particularly in the field of medicine.",

Burkholderia Polysaccharide",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: This topic solicits the development
of serotype-specific, high-affinity monoclonal antibodies that target
Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei and\/or
O-polysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide.    DESCRIPTION:
Burkholderia mallei, causative agent of glanders, and Burkholderia
pseudomallei, causative agent of melioidosis, are recognized as
potential biological warfare threat agents. During World War I, glanders
 was believed to have been spread deliberately by German agents to
infect large numbers of Russian horses and mules on the Eastern Front,
which resulted in humans acquiring the infection. In addition, the
Japanese deliberately infected horses, civilians, and prisoners of war
with glanders at the Pinfang (China) Institute during World War II. The
Soviet Union is also believed to have weaponized Burkholderia as a
potential biological warfare (BW) agent after World War II.
Currently, there are no licensed prophylactic countermeasures to prevent
 infections caused by these intracellular pathogens. Limited efforts to
develop B. mallei and B. pseudomallei vaccines comprised of
O-polysaccharide- (OPS) and capsular polysaccharide (CPS) have had
limited success. However, given the importance of these targets in
protective immunity, identification of alternative strategies to develop
 prophylactic countermeasures against Burkholderia is warranted. In
particular, the development of methods to isolate high-affinity OPS- and
 CPS-specific monoclonal antibodies is anticipated to result in the
development of a prophylactic countermeasure against these weaponizable
agents.     PHASE I: It is anticipated that studies in this initial
phase will focus on the development of a reagents and an animal model
system that will enable the production of B. mallei and\/or B.
pseudomallei OPS- and CPS-specific antibody responses. Use of attenuated
 or non-pathogenic strains of Burkholderia during this phase is
recommended, so long as the selected strains expression
antigenically-identical OPS and CPS to those expressed by wild-type B.
mallei and B. pseudomallei. It is important that offerors ensure
strain-specific antigenic epitopes in the B. mallei and B. pseudomallei
OPS- and CPS are maintained.    PHASE II: It is anticipated that this
phase will focus on isolation of OPS- and CPS-specific hybridoma clones
and demonstration of specificity using in vitro immunochemistry methods.
 Studies to enhance affinity OPS- and CPS-specific monoclonal antibodies
 are also within the scope of this phase. It is also envisaged that if
an acceptable animal model is available, an initial challenge study will
 be conducted as part of a down-select process to identify antibodies
with the highest affinity, specificity and potency. All animal studies
will be conducted under the appropriate containment and review, and at
an accredited location.    PHASE III: Studies in this phase may focus on
 monoclonal antibody humanization and manufacturing process development.
 This phase is also expected to include a demonstration that the
humanized monoclonal antibodies maintained specificity and affinity for
the respective OPS and CPS targets. After successful completion of the
aforementioned milestone and if the monoclonal antibodies merit further
development, cGMP manufacturing will be conducted. Material produced
during cGMP manufacturing will be used to assess toxicity and potency in
 an appropriate animal model. Proof-of-concept efficacy studies in
non-human primates (NHPs), if an acceptable model is available, are also
 within the scope of this phase. Challenge studies will be conducted
under appropriate biosafety containment conditions.     Milestones: Each
 phase of the project will be milestone driven. The Principal
Investigator will propose milestones prior to starting any phase of the
project.    Deliverables:       Major milestone schedule and decision
tree for project       Monthly reports in the format of a slide deck and

countermeasures for the warfighter and have broader commercial potential

regions to control the spread of this emerging pathogen.",

Detectors",

detectors of shortwave infrared light with high system efficiency
(&gt;90%) and bandwidth (~1 GHz), high fabrication yield, and with
compact (~5U) packaging and turnkey operation.     DESCRIPTION: Single
photon sensitive detectors have many applications including active and
passive imaging, traditional and upcoming quantum optical
communications, and quantum information processing.  For quantum key
distribution in fibers, for instance, the noise properties of the
detectors limit the distance over which one can establish a secure key.
 Similarly, for 3D imaging via LADAR, longitudinal resolution is limited
 by the detector jitter while the detector sensitivity dictates the
trade-off between illumination power and maximum range. Therefore, a
high-bandwidth, high-sensitivity, compact and readily available
photon-counting detector is a key technology for many future scientific
developments and improved DoD application capabilities.    Technologies
for detecting single photons in the telecom band include semiconductor
devices such as Geiger-mode InGaAs avalanche photodiodes (APDs) and
superconducting devices like the transition edge sensor (TES). The
InGaAs APDs can be operated at temperatures accessible via
thermoelectric cooling, making them ideal for applications requiring
compact photon-counting solutions.  InGaAs APDs, however, are typically
plagued by after-pulsing effects, making them ill-suited for
applications requiring high duty-cycle and high-rate detection [1].
Extremely high efficiency and low dark counts can be achieved with
superconducting TES detectors, but the rates are limited to less than 10
 MHz and the systems must be operated in the 100 mK regime requiring an
extensive cooling overhead [2].  New results in superconducting nanowire
 devices [3] have shown that high detection rates, low dark-count rates
(DCRs), and high efficiency are all possible simultaneously with
operating temperatures between 1 and 4 K.  Despite these results,
further performance improvements are needed. For example, detection
efficiency (DE) above 90% and bandwidth (BW) approaching 1 GHz has yet
to be achieved simultaneously.  In addition, innovations leading to a
reduction in the system footprint and improved operability will provide
better accessibility of such technologies to the relevant scientific and
 engineering communities.    The goal of this SBIR project is to further
 improve upon the current state-of-the-art in nanowire single-photon
detector performance while advancing the supporting technologies to
allow for a compact, turn-key commercial system. The final system should
 provide multiple (&gt;2), independent single-pixel detectors with

instructions for additional information.  To be eligible, offerors are
required to provide information demonstrating the scientific and
technical merit and feasibility of a Phase I project. DARPA will not

and may not submit both for the same topic.     OBJECTIVE: Improve the
ability to interrogate and ultimately modulate the neural influences of
inflammation and immune function by enabling the design of new discovery
 tools that probe the bioelectrical states of human cells.
DESCRIPTION: Today's warfighter is subject to a wide range of physical
demands that include significant musculoskeletal stress and injury
related to heavy equipment and gear, high physical exertion in tactical
environments, and potential exposure to a variety of known and emerging
pathogens and toxins. These external stressors typically elicit acute
and\/or chronic inflammatory responses as the body initiates the healing
 process. Advances at the interface of the nervous and immune systems
are critical to understanding inflammation and ultimately optimizing
human performance via the reduction of inflammation.    While the
nervous and immune systems were previously thought to serve and act
distinctly, a picture of an integrated communication and protective
system is beginning to emerge (1). Recent developments in
neurophysiology and immunology have begun to make the connection between
 neural reflexes and inflammation\/immunity (2). Better descriptions of
the ways in which peripheral neurons interact with immune cells may
enable a more comprehensive understanding of inflammation, leading to
potential therapies or approaches to speed healing. Additionally, the
development of techniques to track and functionally manipulate ion flows
 in cells has started to elucidate the possible roles of voltage
gradients in the regulation of cell behaviors (3). Bioelectrical cell
signaling studies are already providing insights in developmental and
cancer biology (4, 5), and further technological advancements in the
field would enable the characterization of the neural\/immune interface.
    Microelectrodes are powerful tools for quantitative, real-time,
single- and multi-cell electrophysiology that require direct physical
contact, which can limit their utility for various types of measurement.
  Additionally, they are limited in terms of spatial resolution and the
ability to localize bioelectric activity and structure at the same time.
  Furthermore, electrical methods are often designed to measure events
that exceed action potential thresholds, whilst important bioelectric
activity can occur at voltage levels below action potential thresholds.
 Ideal tools for bioelectric measurements would offer sub-cellular
resolution, high contrast, high dynamic range, and the ability to probe
large fields of view with many cells in real-time.  Current optical
methods have advantages, yet also suffer in sensitivity (signal to
noise) and require temporal averaging, thereby reducing temporal
resolution. Thus, efforts to measure important bioelectric codes that
guide cell fate and influence immunity still suffer from trade-offs in
spatial, temporal, and voltage resolution, as well as the ability to
record many cells and structures simultaneously.       This solicitation
 calls for the development of new voltage- and\/or field-sensitive dyes
designed to probe the bioelectrical states of cells in neural as well as
 non-neural systems. Commonly available voltage dyes focus on calcium
signaling and provide insight into fast processes (millisecond
timescale). Certain bioelectrical interrogations may benefit from
different chemistries and timescales, as well as the ability to detect
sub-threshold activation of neurons and other cells, thereby requiring a
 finer voltage (and\/or electric field) resolution. Additional
challenges with current state-of-the-art voltage dyes include high cost
for the volume of dye typically required for in vivo studies, low
contrast, and low signal-to-noise ratios.      Recent examples of
methods with promise to improve performance for voltage and field
sensing include fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes,
voltage-sensitive proteins, and other nanoparticles such as quantum dots
 and NV-diamonds. Combined with new optical imaging approaches that
offer unprecedented fields of view at sub-cellular resolution,
successful advancements in probe technology will enable transition to
academic, government, and commercial researchers to propel the field by
offering, for example, lower cost, better stability, greater brightness,
 a broader range of absorption and emission wavelengths, higher
voltage\/field resolution, calibration simplicity, and increased
specificity in targeting of cell regions.    PHASE I: Design a new
voltage-sensitive probe that addresses at least one of the following
technical challenges for measuring bioelectrical states of cells in
neural as well as non-neural systems:  a)  Improvement of voltage
and\/or electric field resolution to detect sub-threshold activation of
neurons and other cells (e.g., approach the ability to report
differences of several mV).  b)  Ability to probe at longer (seconds to
minutes) or shorter (microseconds) timescales than currently available
(milliseconds).  c)  Extension to multiple cell types and\/or specific
cell regions not currently accessible.    Phase I deliverables will
include a technical report detailing the experiments and results
supporting the successful demonstration of a new voltage-sensitive probe
 that meets the selected technical challenge. Phase I deliverables will
also include a Phase II transition plan for demonstrating sufficient
reproducibility of the developed probe and potential research
advancement to merit commercialization. The Phase II transition plan
will include a description of the commercialization path, any barriers
to market entry, and any identified early adoption partners.    DIRECT
TO PHASE II - Offerors interested in submitting a Direct to Phase II
proposal in response to this topic must provide documentation to
substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility
described in the Phase I section of this topic has been met and
describes the potential commercial applications. Documentation should
include all relevant information including, but not limited to:
technical reports, test data, prototype designs\/models, and performance
 goals\/results. Read and follow Section 7.0 of the DARPA Instructions.
   PHASE II: Seek to finalize and validate the voltage-sensitive probe
developed in Phase I and demonstrate the utility beyond currently
available probes to address the selected technical challenge.
Additionally, establish and describe the market competitiveness of the
new probe in the context of the combination of features that are
desirable for a specific, defined application of the probe. This could
include manufacture cost, probe stability, brightness, absorption and
emission wavelength availability, sensitivity, and calibration
simplicity.    If successful, Phase II deliverables will include a
detailed technical profile of the new voltage-sensitive probe that fully
 illustrates the advanced capabilities for the selected challenge,
establishes the desirable parameters that validates the probe as a
viable tool, and describes the commercialization path.    PHASE III: The
 successful development of a new voltage-sensitive probe will enable a
mechanistic understanding for modulating inflammation and immune
function via neural interfaces. This capability is critical to
understanding inflammation and its relation to human performance in
order to address DoD challenges. The ultimate realization of the
underlying technologies will advance healing and performance in the
context of physical demands specific to the warfighter, including
musculoskeletal stress and injury related to heavy equipment and gear,
high physical exertion in tactical environments, and potential exposure
to a variety of known and emerging pathogens and toxins.    The
successful development of a new voltage-sensitive probe will propel
advances in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors with the end
goal of understanding the bioelectrical underpinnings of inflammation
and immunity to promote health and healing. Additionally, the ability to
 modulate the neural influences of inflammation and immune function has
significant implications for a wide range of therapeutic and diagnostic
applications in addition to healing and human performance. New probes
are in demand that would have high impact for other areas of healthcare,
 including tumor detection, stem cell research, and regenerative
medicine.",

of this SBIR is to develop and demonstrate a compact cryogenic generator
 capable of producing 1 L\/hr of liquid nitrogen for use in electronics
and optics cryogenic cooling applications. The entire system should
weigh no more than 5 kg, occupy no more than 0.1 m^3, require less than
0.75 kW to operate, and achieve a MTBF of at least 10^4 hours.
DESCRIPTION: Thermal management is a key barrier to enhanced performance
 of many defense electronic and optical systems and improvements in heat
 removal and temperature control are needed to realize the full
potential of emerging electronics and optics technologies. Use of a
cryogenic coolant could lead to dramatic improvements in performance
through higher efficiency, switching speed, sensitivity, and\/or output
power for respective components. For example, CMOS transistor switching
speeds at 80K are approximately twice the room  temperature values and
the efficiency of solid state laser diodes can be increased from 65% at
room temperature to 85% at -50C.     The low liquid nitrogen production
rate and large SWaP of current commercial cryogenic generators has
prevented their broad use in defense electronic and optical systems.
Yet, the delivery logistics and associated volume and weight limit the
defense applications that can be met with stored liquid nitrogen. Thus, a
 compact, low SWaP cryogenic generator, capable of producing liquid
nitrogen as needed in the field and\/or on a mobile air, land, or sea
platform, could find ready acceptance in the defense industry and in a
broad range of commercial applications.     PHASE I: Design, build, and
successfully demonstrate the operation of a laboratory prototype
cryogenic generator capable of generating 1 L\/hr of liquid nitrogen
that weighs less than 10 kg and requires less than 1.5 kW of input
power.    Required Phase I deliverables will include comprehensive
device testing report, detailed design of the laboratory device, a
description of the refrigeration cycle utilized in developing the
generation capability and anticipated performance limits, and a
comparison of the measured performance against the anticipated limits.

   PHASE II: Based on the performance achieved in the Phase I SBIR,
design, build, and demonstrate the operation of a cryogenic generator
capable of generating 1 L\/hr of liquid nitrogen that weighs less than 5
 kg, occupies less than 0.1 m^3, requires less than 0.75 kW of input
power, has a predicted MTBF of 10^4 hours and is capable of being
integrated into a selected platform. Conduct life-cycle and
environmental testing, appropriate to a selected DoD platform and
electronics application, including demonstration of at least 1000 hrs of
 continuous, failure-free operation in the appropriate pressure and
temperature environment.    Required Phase II deliverables will include a
 working cryogenic generator at the TRL 6 level, a trade space analysis
examining how the device can be scaled up or scaled down depending on
future applications, and a comparison, along with analysis, of the
predicted and measured performance characteristics.        PHASE III:
The commercial\/dual use applications would include utilizing this in
high performance computer workstations, MRIs, SEMs, and other devices
that require a steady supply of liquid nitrogen. For DoD purposes, this
technology would be developed into the front end of a cryogenic cooling
loop to be used for airborne, shipboard, or mobile electro-optics
platforms, high performance computers, or other electronic or optical
devices.",

Miniature Underwater Vehicles",
        "description": "This topic is eligible for the DARPA Direct to

instructions for additional information.  To be eligible, offerors are

between submitting a Phase I proposal OR a Direct to Phase II proposal,
and may not submit both for the same topic.    OBJECTIVE: Develop
reliable feature based localization capabilities for miniature
underwater vehicles in shallow water environments. The system would
combine accurate localization and mapping capabilities by utilizing
miniaturized techniques such as onboard imagery sensors and inertial
measurement sensors, e.g. sonar(s), lidars, enhanced cameras, and gyros.
 The system should allow a small undersea vehicle to perform an extended
 mission and return very close to the point of launch without surfacing.
  The system should be able to recognize naturally occurring features;
optionally, man-made passive"features"could be emplaced along the path
of the vehicle, but would need to be included in the overall system
weight budget.     DESCRIPTION: One of the major challenges when
deploying unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) is proper
self-localization without available reference signals provided by, for
example, Global Position System (GPS) or long baseline (LBL) acoustic
positioning system. Present-day intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance (ISR) missions often require the UUV to remain submerged
for extended periods of time. Although ground velocity sensor systems
such as Doppler Velocity Logs (DVLs) have been successfully designed and
 tested for large and medium scale vehicles, their deployment onboard
small UUVs is often impractical for size, weight and power (SWaP)
reasons.     One of the smallest, currently available DVLs on the market
 weighs 6+ lbs [1], and thus accounts for a large portion of the weight
budget for a small UUV. Additionally, although the accuracy of velocity
measurements has rapidly improved over the last decade, an error
accumulation within the navigation solution is still unavoidable for
long-endurance ISR missions due to the lack of true position feedback.
  Recent advances in sonar technology have led to a significant
reduction in hardware size and power consumption [2,3]. A trade- off for
 small sonar units exists in the relatively high frequency of the
ping(s) leading to a limited maximum range of just a few hundred meters.
 However, for shallow water applications, sonar based navigation
solutions may provide an alternative to and\/or complement DVL
technology by providing true position feedback. In particular, the
detected range and bearing angle of features and\/or landmarks within
the field of view can be utilized to enhance the overall navigation
solution via, for example, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
[4,5].    PHASE I: Develop a preliminary system design concept combining
 software and hardware components for a complete navigation solution.
Study overall feasibility, derive the anticipated system performance
metrics, and expose potential limitations. Conduct system level modeling
 and analysis to provide a proof of concept.  Show improvement in SWaP
and or navigational accuracy over existing approaches and equipment.

Phase II proposal in response to this topic must provide documentation
to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility

include all relevant information including, but not limited to:
technical reports, test data, prototype designs\/models, and performance
 goals\/results. Read and follow Section 7.0 of the DARPA Instructions.
   PHASE II: Design, build and test the prototype navigation system and
demonstrate performance metrics in a realistic underwater environment.
Analyze the anticipated integration effort into existing and future UUV
platforms.    PHASE III: Accurate navigation based on bottom features
will minimize vehicle exposure on the surface and make the vehicle
robust to GPS jamming.   Accurate navigation is essential for a variety
of unmanned undersea vehicle missions including ISR of harbors. A highly
 accurate underwater navigation system which is suitable for small UUVs
would support a variety of commercial applications such as biological
and chemical sampling, autonomous border or perimeter patrol,
maintenance missions on underwater cables and pipelines, search and
recovery operations, and natural resource surveys.  Being able to go
along the bottom and stay deep with a small affordable autonomous system
 would be a desirable commercial product.",

 Hypersonic Vehicles",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Identify and demonstrate a new
material system with suitable material properties to realize the
advanced leading edges for use in reusable or long flight time
hypersonic vehicles.     DESCRIPTION: Air Force-relevant applications
include but not limited to sharp leading edges, rocket nozzles, throats
and engine combustion parts are key components that enable hypersonic
flight. These leading edges and high temperature parts experience high
temperatures over 2200 degrees C at&gt;Mach 8 flight conditions in high
altitude air environment, resulting from aerothermally induced high heat
 flux. They further experience high ambient fluid velocities, mechanical
 vibrations, and thermal stresses from severe heat flux gradients and
thermal shock. The materials that can survive such extreme conditions
even for short exposure intervals are currently very limited. The
state-of-the art high temperature fiber reinforced composites, including
 C\/C, C\/SiC and SiC\/SiC composites, cannot meet the challenges.
Ultra-High-Temperature Ceramics (UHTC) materials based on refractory
metal diborides (HfB2 or ZrB2) and containing optimum silicon carbide
concentration (in either bulk or CMC form) have demonstrated the best
performances to date. However, these alloys are still not thermal shock
resistant enough for reliable use in a cyclic environment. In addition,
they suffer from accelerating oxidation and ablation above 1800 degrees C
 due to volatilization of the glassy component. They also suffer
tendency for spallation of the crystalline oxide partly due to phase
transformations. The current UHTC technologies seem to have reached
their limits, so new alloys are needed to address the property
improvements required for the near future. Innovative material designs
and possibly new fabrication technologies must be identified to enable
applicability to advanced sharp leading edges for hypersonic vehicles.
The next generations of ultra-high temperature materials need to form
high density, stable crystalline oxide phases and they should not
contain volatile phases. These materials will also need to have high
thermal shock resistance (i.e., requiring high temperature strength of
100 Ksi, fracture toughness exceeding 7 MPam1\/2 and thermal
conductivity exceeding 50 w\/m2K).     PHASE I:  Identify candidate
material systems and validate a proof-of-concept solution. Complete
preliminary evaluation of the material performances with adequate
laboratory evaluation approaches. This will require limited
thermal-mechanical property evaluation from room temperature to at least
 1600 degrees C. Oxidation and thermal shock resistance should be
assessed torch testing in air up to 2200 degrees C.     PHASE II:
Expand on Phase I results by further improvements to the material and
its properties database using experiments that simulated condition of
hypersonic flight. Identify and develop a cost-effective manufacturing
process and produce the hardware designs for a four-inch long leading
edge and provide a description for commercialization that takes into
account civilian use for land-based power turbines, nuclear industry and
 nuclear medicine, and range of wide band gap electronic materials
systems.     PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Transition the component
technology to the Air Force system integrator or payload contractor,
mature it for operational insertion, and demonstrate the technology in
an operational level environment. Demonstration would include, but not

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop SiGeSn epitaxy on silicon
and germanium substrates for new degrees of freedom in optoelectronic
devices operating in the wavelength range between 2.0 and 5.0
micrometers.     DESCRIPTION:  Conventional mid-infrared materials based
 on the III-V (GaInSb) and the II-VI (HgCdTe) materials are relatively
expensive and incompatible with silicon-based integrated circuit
processing.  SiGe technology is pervasive for electronic applications,
but the indirect energy gap prevents extensive applications in
optoelectronics. Recent progress on SiGeSn (Silicon Germanium Tin)
source materials and the promise of a direct energy gap for certain
compositions promises significant optical performance, similar to the
III-V compounds, but with compatibility with silicon circuit processing.
 In order to verify the expected materials parameters, and to make
further breakthroughs, innovations are needed in growth, device and
structure fabrication.  SiGeSn emitters and detectors must be grown and
characterized to determine their attributes and limitations.        One
significant challenge involves the epitaxy of high quality layers on
silicon and germanium substrates, depending on application.  Compared to
 conventional SiGe epitaxy, the main limitation comes from the need to
modify the growth conditions, such as reducing the substrate
temperature.  Novel CVD materials are required such as deuterated
stannane as the Sn source.  The optimum growth parameters are solicited
to produce device-grade material.       Once high quality epitaxy is
available, it is important to find how device performance depends on
material properties. With the compositional dependence of lattice
constant and band gap, the optimum layer structures, and heterostructure
 and superlattice combinations are sought.  Interesting devices based on
 strained layer superlattices and quantum cascade mechanisms can be
designed and fabricated.  While SiGe and III-V optoelectronic devices
have been well characterized in terms of band offsets, optical
confinement, and radiative recombination, little is known about these
effects in SiGeSn.  Innovative ideas leading to effective SiGeSn
optoelectronic devices are solicited.     PHASE I: Demonstrate the
feasibility to fabricate optoelectronic devices by the growth of
epitaxial SiGeSn films on Si or Ge substrates either by MBE (Molecular
Beam Epitaxy) or CVD (chemical vapor deposition) methods.   Provide
experimental evidence for a direct energy gap and significant
optoelectronic performance, including high optical absorption and
efficient infrared emission.       PHASE II: Fabricate and characterize
infrared emitters and detectors operating within the spectral range of 2
 - 5 um.  Demonstrate significant performance through enhanced and
longer wave performance compared to other Group-IV detectors, and by
efficient light emission comparable to that of Group-III-V materials.

will be used to make infrared device structures as required by military

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  The development of innovative
mathematical techniques for the design of digital filters allowing
trade-offs between accuracy, precision and memory.     DESCRIPTION:  The
 design of finite impulse response (FIR or non-recursive) and infinite
impulse response (IIR or recursive) digital filters has a long history
and, over the years, many methods have been developed to design FIR, IIR
 filters, adaptive filters and filter cascades. The primary task of a
digital filter is to alter in some prescribed manner the frequency
content of a signal. In most cases, the prescribed frequency
modifications cannot be achieved exactly and, hence, filter design
problems involve some type of approximation or optimization. This
optimization is typically a balance between simultaneously matching the
magnitude response of the filter, the phase response of the filter or
the group delay of the filter with the prescribed filter specifications.
 These challenging optimization problems are then solved using a variety
 of algorithms. A critical property of a filter is its application cost,
 especially in problems with stringent execution time and hardware
constraints. Widely used techniques for filter design define optimality
of design differently and may not directly reflect the cost of filter
application. For example, an algorithm that produces an optimal
equaripple FIR design may not yield the most efficient (cost effective)
filter for achieving given specifications. In particular, it is
difficult to obtain an accurate, robust and highly efficient design for a
 filter that requires sharp transitions within narrow sub-bands or
requires a complicated structure of the pass-band. In hardware
implementations, optimization at algorithm level typically achieves
greater cost reduction than at architecture or logic level. If the
filter design specifications are generated via a measurement process,
instead of a fixed set of specifications, one would like a design
algorithm that guarantees convergence and assures accuracy and
efficiency of the resulting filter. This ability to automatically design
 in real time such filters based on measured data could significantly
impact many applications. Desirable approaches will allow real-time,
near optimal filter re-design that is then automatically deployed. The
approach should lend itself to efficient hardware implementations on a
variety of architectures. Because the design of optimized filters may
require significant expert knowledge there is interest in new, robust
approaches to automate filter design and make it possible for their use
in real time applications.     PHASE I: A clear description of the
mathematical framework for the filter design and a demonstration of the
feasibility of the proposed approach. Also the approach must be shown to
 perform the same or better than expert-guided techniques. In particular
 it must be demonstrated on filters with sharp transitions within a very
 narrow bandwidth as well as filters with a complicated structure of the
 passband.     PHASE II: Successful completion of Phase II should
provide a user-friendly software implementation of the proposed
solutions within one or more application domains.      PHASE III DUAL

advantages as microwave switches, tuners, filters and phase shifters

applications of RF MEMS, such as in antenna tuners for mobile handsets,
have started to take off [3]. For high-yield, high-volume and low-cost
fabrication, these commercially available RF MEMS are typically
fabricated by using the same complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor
(CMOS) technology as in the fabrication of most integrated circuits [3].
 Therefore, it is desirable to take advantage of intelligent control
achievable by using CMOS integrated circuits to improve the robustness
and reliability of RF MEMS by orders of magnitudes, making them suitable
 for defense applications, as well as demanding commercial applications
such as in cellular base stations [4]. Giving the interest and advance
in the private sector in this topic, use of government materials,
equipment, data or facilities is not anticipated.    PHASE I: Research
the actuation mechanism and performance characteristics of RF MEMS
switches and develop the best intelligent closed-loop feedback control
strategy to improve their robustness and reliability. Design an
intelligent control circuit that can allow RF MEMS switches to operate
over the military temperature range with long operating life. Evaluate
potential improvement through simulation.     PHASE II: Fabricate the
control circuit and integrate it with RF MEMS switches to demonstrate
reliable operations with 1) -55  degrees C to 125  degrees C ambient
temperature variation, 2) week-long continuous contact, and 3) 100
billion repetitions of intermittent contact, respectively. Evaluate the
trade-off between performance, robustness, reliability, cost, size and
power consumption.     PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  Robust and
reliable RF MEMS switches, tuners, filters and phase shifters in
reconfigurable RF front ends for defense radar and communication
systems, as well as cellular base stations.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate an
innovative wound dressing that quantitatively reports tissue perfusion
for monitoring and optimizing wound healing.     DESCRIPTION:  The
current standard-of-care for wounds and grafts relies on subjective
observations of tissue health that are episodic and can vary greatly
between caregivers with different degrees of training (1). For example,
measurements of tissue perfusion, a critical parameter necessary for
wound and graft healing, currently rely on qualitative assessments of
wound healing, including tissue color, temperature, capillary refill and
 smell. This lack of quantitative tissue oxygenation information can
lead to poor outcomes; without accurate knowledge of tissue perfusion,
thermal burn sites, for example, may be inadequately debrided, leading
to subsequent graft failure with accompanying aesthetic and functional
consequences (2). This lack of operator-independent, quantitative and
non-episodic perfusion monitoring of wounds, grafts and flaps (3) has
been recognized as a major unmet need for our wounded warriors. Current
oxygen sensing tools rely on fragile probes that require extensive
training to use correctly, provide only point measurements, and are not
easily integrated into battlefield or surgical settings.
Problematically, current wound assessment and therapeutic methods
require the removal of dressings, resulting in further disruptions to
the surgical site or wound bed that can lead to discomfort, compromised
healing and complications. New objective approaches for monitoring and
treating wounds are needed to improve surgical outcome and wound healing
 for both military personnel and civilians.         To address these
needs, a transparent wound dressing will be developed that provides
real-time maps of tissue oxygenation and other parameters across entire
wounds, surgical beds or burn sites for direct, continuous monitoring of
 tissue health throughout the healing process. A potential approach to
this development is to build upon the research described in reference
(4).  A further development aim of this topic, to eliminate the need for
 dressing removal during treatment, is a therapeutic release system
integrated into the bandage for interactive, spatio-specific delivery of
 drugs directly to vulnerable tissues. This Sensing, Monitoring, And
Release of Therapeutics (SMART) bandage system could then be used for
post-treatment wound monitoring to provide caregivers with a continuous,
 quantitative read-out of treatment response and wound healing.
PHASE I: Develop, refine and demonstrate an oxygen sensing bandage that
incorporates an oxygen sensing layer removed from direct tissue contact,
 and a semi-permeable barrier layer that buffers the sensing layer from
room oxygen.     PHASE II: Based on Phase I results, develop and test a
clinical prototype system consisting of the oxygen sensing bandage, an
optical imaging device, and software algorithms that will integrate the
two and enable quantitative mapping of wound-healing parameters.  Also
in this phase, create the initial design specifications for prototyping
the therapeutic release capability within the bandage.     PHASE III
DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  The focus in Phase III will be to conduct human
studies of a fully integrated oxygen sensing and monitoring system in
both battlefield and civilian settings, and to integrate the prototype
therapeutic release capability into the bandage system.",

from thermodynamic equilibrium domain (highly doped polycrystalline
materials, nano-structured systems and supersaturated structures, etc.).
 The processing includes shockwave consolidation and external fields.
   DESCRIPTION:  Conventional processing techniques typically prepare
materials from a melt or using powder metallurgy techniques, such as hot
 pressing followed by sintering. These conventional techniques enable
production of materials close to the equilibrium state with relatively
large grains (crystallites) within the material and cause the loss of
nanostructure dimensionality.  Materials design and processing
approaches at or close to the equilibrium state can impose limitations
on the properties.       Processing utilizing shockwave consolidation
via explosions, high pressure gun systems, and\/or electromagnetic waves
 (e.g., microwaves, electron beams, laser, etc.) may lead to new
materials with desirable, tailorable properties. A specific thrust area
of interest is the discovery of new techniques for consolidation of nano
 powders, measuring, and analyzing thermal phenomena induced by shock
waves and under aforementioned external fields during processing.  This
requires understanding of the time domain and associated definition for
the state of the material in relation to equilibrium state.      The
ultimate goal of exploiting these phenomena is to stabilize
non-equilibrium phases and design future materials and components that
break the paradigm of today"s materials where the boundaries of
performance\/failure are defined by the equilibrium state.  The end-use
areas could include, but are not limited to, transparent laser
materials, multifunctional ceramics, shape memory alloys and reactive
materials.     PHASE I:  1. Define and design shockwave-driven
processing techniques.      2. Demonstrate hierarchical stability of the
 microstructure as function of external stimuli, e.g., explosive
compaction, high speed gas guns, or electromagnetic waves.      3.
Design proof-of-concept material in non-equilibrium state by
demonstrating supersaturated dopant concentration (at least 10x of
equilibrium dopant concentration).     PHASE II:  1. Further
improvements to material system and its properties.       2. Establish
quantitative"Selection Rules"for stability of heterogeneous structures.
Map out the non-equilibrium"phase diagram"enabled through shockwave
processing.       3. Understand processing trade space by correlating
time and length scales with emerging microstructure.         4. Identify
 and develop a cost-effective manufacturing technique to achieve
non-equilibrium materials developed in Phases I and II.     PHASE III

Distribution Systems",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate an on demand
 single photon source for use in a free-space Quantum Key Distribution
(QKD) satellite to ground configuration.     DESCRIPTION:  Security in
quantum key distribution (QKD) arises from the principle that the
quantum state of a single photon, prepared in an unknown basis, can only
 be determined with a probabilistic outcome.  This fact both limits the
information that may be gleaned by an eavesdropper and allows
eavesdropping to be detected via errors that are introduced into the
quantum channel.      In practice, attenuated laser pulses are often
employed as a photon source and offer a wide range of useful spectral
and temporal characteristics.  However, the photon number of such pulses
 is described by Poissonian statistics and necessarily includes
multi-photon pulses.  The pulses that contain multi-photons can in
principle be exploited by an eavesdropper to gain information without
detection.        Recent developments in non-Poissonian photon sources
suggest that it may be possible to minimize or eliminate the risk of
multi-photon pulses for use in QKD.  In order to be useful in a
free-space QKD scenario that includes atmospheric propagation, a
non-Poissonian source would need to be developed with the following
characteristics:       1. The 2nd order coherence function, g(2), should
 approach zero.   2. The center wavelength should lie within an
atmospheric transmission band and within a region of high detector
quantum efficiency.   3. The spectral emission width should be of the
order of 1 GHz.   4. The controlled emission timing jitter should be
less than 100 picoseconds.   5. The temporal emission width should be
less than 1 nanosecond.   6. The emission rate should be greater than 1
MHz.   7. The source should be directional with near-diffraction-limited
 wavefront quality.      Desirable sources will be controllable and emit
 a single photon"on demand"at an arbitrary user-specified time with very
 low probability of zero or multi-photon emission.  Sources will produce
 narrowband single photon emission in the spectral range of 750  1600 nm
 at a rate of = 1MHz or higher.  The source should be compatible with
free space propagation in the Earth"s atmosphere (space-to-ground links)
 and compatible with corresponding developments with single photon
detector technologies.  The use of narrowband emission allows for
spectral filtering for daytime use.  To be most effective this source
should show a high contrast in antibunching (single photon emission),
exhibit high quantum efficiency, show extreme photostability
(photoluminescence stability (i.e., no photobleaching) and\/or extreme
electrostability (electroluminescence stability).  To be extensively
used, this source should be robust and capable of packing for airborne
or space platforms.     PHASE I:  Design an on-demand single photon
source capable of producing: narrowband photon emission in the spectral
range 750-1600nm; single photons at a rate of = 1 MHz. Approach should
include a detailed design description &amp; supporting physics based
analysis to demonstrate achievement of sub-Poissonian statistics.
Prepare a plan for prototype development &amp; testing &amp; determine
DoD application feasibility.     PHASE II:  Prepare and test prototype
single photon source with high emission rates, high contrast
antibunching and efficiency, photostability and electrostability.
Demonstrate achievement of sub-Poissonian statistics by intensity
autocorrelation measurements of g(2).  Identify packaging and systems
integration issues for operation in a LEO environment.      PHASE III

 all DoD &amp; NRO spacecraft &amp; many other operational systems.

Conditions",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To develop a method to optimize
scheduling and planning for Space Situational Awareness (SSA) collects.
    DESCRIPTION:  The AFSPC (Air Force Space Command) Space Surveillance
 Network (SSN) and AFRL (Air Force Research Laboratory) utilizes a
number of ground based observatory telescope systems to observe
satellites and obtain awareness to support Space Situational Awareness
(SSA).  These telescope systems can operate in a variety of
configurations to collect highly resolved images of Low Earth Orbiting
(LEO) satellites and to perform non-resolved
detection\/astronomy\/photometry of both Geosynchronous Earth Orbit
(GEO) and LEO satellites.  In astronomy, mission planning and scheduling
 of telescopes is simply a matter of determining whether the object is
within the field of regard of the sensor, and is bright enough to be
seen by the sensor.  Since the brightness usually doesn"t vary, and the
line of sight between the object and the sensor can be predicted with
great accuracy years in advance, the scheduling is pretty
straightforward, other than the variable of weather.  However, for
satellites, the brightness is highly dependent on the orientation of the
 satellite and the solar phase anglethe angle between the
sun-satellite-sensor.  Furthermore, our knowledge of the orbit is not
precise enough for us to predict months in advance what the optimal
viewing opportunities will be.  Current processes are manpower intensive
 and mostly based on whether the satellite breaks the horizon, and an
average brightness that doesn"t account for phase angle.  Collecting
data under sub-optimal conditions can lead to data that is useless, thus
 wasting resources that could be devoted elsewhere.      AFRL has
previously developed detailed models that accurately predict the
appearance of a satellite under a variety of illumination conditions.
Furthermore, validated models of noise caused by atmospheric turbulence
and scattering are prevalent within the academic community.  AFRL is
seeking an automated methodology to use an understanding of satellite
radiometry, site-specific parameters, satellite orbital uncertainties
and atmospheric turbulence and scattering to improve our ability to plan
 observation schedules and improve efficiency.      While model-based
predictions are often a good predictor of brightness, sometimes models
are wrong or are unavailable.  The system can have access to a
historical database of observations including object number, day\/time,
and calibrated magnitude, enabling the ability to choose optimum viewing
 conditions based on actual data, rather than based on models.
Automated methods are preferred over manual methods.     PHASE I:
Develop a logic tree of factors for mission planning.  Assess existing
databases, radiometric, atmospheric, noise models and performance data
against the logic tree.  Formulate an automated method that provides a
6-month schedule, a refined monthly schedule and a detailed weekly
schedule to optimize collection opportunities for a variety of sensor
systems and runs within 2 minutes.    PHASE II:  Implement an improved
mission planning tool that permits AFSPC and AFRL SSA assets to improve
collection efficiency and success.  Develop an automated method for
mission planning that provides a 6-month schedule, a refined monthly
schedule and a detailed weekly schedule to optimize collection
opportunities.  Demonstrate the mission planning tool using AFRL
telescopes at the Maui Space Surveillance and Starfire Optical Range

potential exists to maintain consistent awareness of all man-made
objects extending to Geosynchronous Earth Orbits (GEOs) and
super-synchronous regimes by combining the use of multiple telescopes:
one tasked to observe known or newly discovered objects (uncorrelated
targets or UCTs), and one repeatedly surveying the sky to detect changes
 and discover new objects. Scheduling these sensors is not straight
forward as they have limitations on sensitivity, field of view, required
 revisit time, operation in inclement weather, and maintenance downtime.
 Solutions are needed that can maximize awareness of man-made objects
over a region by building a scheduler that adapts to real-time
operational status changes and is robust enough to follow up on UCTs and
 meet high priority satellite needs. Scheduling strategies to optimize
search patterns for 2 or more telescopes need to be developed so that
they can operate in"search mode"where most appropriate and efficient and
 look for specific objects in a"tasked mode"mode when most efficient.

real-time mission planning software for scheduling search-based in
concert with tasked sensors to reduce the number of UCTs near GEO
orbits. Include a user interface that accepts input on weather, sensor

algorithms to determine search rate. Software development must be
modular to accept future improvements in the processing algorithm
without significant code rewrite. It will start with a nominal
sensitivity and coverage rate search sensor but can be configured for
operational desires (increase repeat frequency, increase coverage area,
increase range of velocities, etc.) and based on the analysis
accomplished in Phase I.     2. Build real-time mission planning
software for collection with tasked sensors to maximize coverage
area\/sensitivity\/revisit\/number of objects near GEO. Accounting for
weather and sensor outages, collect frequently enough to maintain
custody, detect changes, and detect new dim objects, and follow
up\/correlate\/determine orbits\/and characterize new dim objects.
Software development must be modular to complement future improvements
in this area. It should be able to be initially configured by the sensor
 parameters and operational tasking (increase repeat frequency, increase

        "topic_name": "Battlefield Airmen (BA) Mission Recorder",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate a device
that can record essential information from special operations missions
in order to perform mission analysis\/debriefing, enhance operational
procedures, and improve BA training and mission rehearsals.
DESCRIPTION:  Battlefield Airmen missions range from Close Air Support,
to field surveys, to direct combat.  These special operations are
typically high stress and rely on the individual operator's memory of
actual events for follow-on actions, like mission debriefing, tactics
improvements, training, and future mission rehearsals.  Unfortunately,
operator memory can"t always be relied upon due to detrimental factors
such as the fast-paced nature and stressful dynamics of special ops
missions; war casualties; the vast amount of detailed information to be
remembered (time, location, who said what to whom, etc.); time lag after
 conclusion of operations (resulting in inability to remember key
details); and individual operators"mental capacity to accurately
recollect events.      The purpose of this effort is to overcome those
deficiencies by developing a robust capability that captures critical
elements of voice (radio communications) and location of each BA action.
  The mission recording technology would serve a very similar function
to that of an aircraft"black box."Mission recording technology is used
regularly in aircraft and other systems to record vital communications
and other system information.  This recorded data is valuable for
post-mission debriefing, to develop training scenarios, and to review
missions and improve operational tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTP).  BA warfighters have been at the forefront of recent operations
in Iraq and Afghanistan.   Those operations revealed a need for a
capability to record key aspects of their missions, yet that capability
does not exist.      There are many different types of recorders in
industry, but none has the functionality needed for BA missions.
Current state-of-the-art (SoA) recorders do have the capability to
record audio through a variety of input methods and recording features;
however, they specifically lack integration with operational radios, as
well as integration with GPS time and location stamp.      What is
needed is a capability which can interface with the equipment carried by
 BA operators in order to capture incoming and outgoing radio
communications.  If the technology solution is carried by the operator
it must plug in-line with the operator's radio and headset through the
standard jack.  In other words, such a solution would connect to the
radio and provide the same standard jack as an output for communication
to a push-to-talk and headset.  If the technology solution is not
carried by the operator, it must function from a secure environment and
be easily accessible to operators when needed.  Audio format must be a
common format like WAV or MP3 so it"s easily compatible with existing
playback equipment.  In addition to radio voice communications, the
device should record the geographic position (GPS coordinates) and time
of individual radio voice segments.      The recorder must be radio and
headset agnostic (if carried by the operator), simple to use, encrypt
the data, include a zeroize function (quickly and permanently erase
data), and must not require external processing in order to operate.  It
 also must function under a variety of environmental conditions such as
rain, snow, high humidity, and ambient temperatures ranging from 0
degrees F to 110 degrees F.  The recorder should require low power and
if carried by the operator, draw it from the radios, i.e., no separate
batteries for the recorder.  Currently, operational radios have the
ability to support power draw by external devices. Playback\/mission
analysis would not occur on the recorder, but on a computer with the
proper software.  Data encryption shall use DoD-approved methods to
protect SECRET and below information.  Use of a commercial standard
(like AES) will be acceptable for any Phase I prototypes developed.
Future versions of the Mission Recorder should allow the option of
recording two radios through one technology solution.     PHASE I:
Define the system requirements.  Identify appropriate components to
create a system design.  Analyze the software necessary to enable the
system to work.  Propose a design to be built and demonstrated during
Phase II.  Demonstration of laboratory breadboard prototype hardware
during Phase I is highly desired, but not required.     PHASE II:  Build
 and demonstrate the recorder in a relevant environment.  Recorder must
meet requirements as stated in description above.  Additionally, design
should show significant consideration for human factors, including, but
not limited to: size, weight, power, minimal cable management, and
ambidexterity.  Expected Technology Readiness Level of the recorder by
the end of Phase II is TRL 6, and preferably TRL 7.     PHASE III DUAL
USE APPLICATIONS:  Military Application: Special tactics missions;
anti-terrorist actions; urban warfare; team reconnaissance.  Commercial
Application: Law enforcement; homeland security; fire-fighting;
hostage-rescue; fast-paced team activities that could benefit from
forensic analysis of what transpired.",

        "topic_name": "Improved Computerized Ground Forces for Close Air
 Support Training",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate intelligent
agents to interact within a computer generated forces suite for training
 aid use in Joint Terminal Attack Controller Training simulated
environment.     DESCRIPTION:  In current military operations our
missions have become more complex and dynamic than they have been in the
 past. Given the nature of current operations the requirements for
training and simulation is also accelerated. Our warfighters work with
many different assets and therefore they should have the opportunity to
train with the same assets they go to war with. Close Air Support (CAS)
is one of the most challenging pursuits in combat today. It is
challenging to train to CAS in a simulator due to the number of
personnel required to attain a quality training experience. CAS players
may include fast jets, unmanned aircraft, ground controllers and
operation centers. Given the current ops tempo and availability of joint
 and distributed training opportunities, intelligent agents that work
within CGFs would be tremendously valuable to assist in CAS training
scenarios. Even if the personnel resources were available for all
trainees to partake in an exercise, it is difficult to attain quality
training for all players.      The current state-of-the-art simulator
available for Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) training is the
Indirect Fire Forward Observer Trainer (I-FACT^TM). In order to use this
 simulation system, the non-training audience is required to be very
large so that a robust and dynamic training environment can be
replicated. This presents a technology gap that if filled will make
training both more efficient and effective. To fulfill this gap,
intelligent agents that work within a simulated environment using
published simulation standards need to be developed.        Presently,
the state-of-the-art for agents and intelligent role players exist in
domains outside of military simulation. These agents are not programmed
to interact using simulation standards. Furthermore, present
state-of-the-art for intelligent agents do not behave appropriately for
the military mission set; agents need to provide feedback using
doctrinally correct responses. The desired end-state for this effort is
the development of a prototype intelligent agent that will use the
appropriate protocols to work within a CGF software suite. This will in
turn be seamlessly integrated as white force assets into a government or
 commercial simulated training environment.        This effort aims to
limit the white force or training aide assets required to provide
immersive and realistic training for warfighters who support a CAS
mission and for this effort specifically the JTAC. The primary focus of
this work is to demonstrate the injection of white-force role players
into a CGF that communicate and behave in a realistic manner to provide
robust and cost-efficient training opportunities. The technical work
associated with this effort should ensure that interoperability training
 standards are used. The modeled entities should be constructed
synthetically and formatted so that both government and COTS systems may
 be used in parallel.     PHASE I:  Identify and document CAS-related
missions that the JTAC warfighters are expected to engage in with U.S.
and allied partners. Identify and document possible white-force role
players to be injected into a CGF. Develop and demonstrate a prototype
of a functioning white force injected into a CGF for a JTAC-related CAS
mission.     PHASE II:  Upon successful demonstration in the Phase I
effort, the white force agent will be refined, fully developed, and
tested in a simulated environment. In addition, an additional agent will
 be developed to support an additional white force role. Both agents
will be demonstrated in simulated training environment. Three CAS test
 scenarios will be developed that utilize the injected white force
agents into a CGF.     PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  This effort
will provide an array of intelligent role players injected into CGFs to
stimulate training environments for ground forces, to include Tactical
Air Control Party (TACP), Air Battle Managers (ABM), Air Support
Operations Center, and Air Operations Center warfighters.",

        "topic_name": "Holographic Lightfield 3D Display Metrology
(HL3DM)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop test and evaluation
methodology for holographic lightfield 3D displays with an automated
measurement system to support comparisons of prototypes emerging from
research, to enable robust calibration, and to perform product
acceptance testing.       DESCRIPTION:  Advanced FoLD 3D visualization
systems, that enable multi-user full-parallax viewing of complex 3D data
 without eyewear, are being developed with the aim of increasing the
productivity of operators and analysts in C2 Operations Centers. FoLD
approaches have many potential advantages over the more common
stereoscopic 3D (S3D) displays, including improved comfort and
perception. FoLD systems achieve these user-acceptance improvements by
(a) correcting S3D's incongruous accommodative, vergence and motion
parallax depth cues and (b) eliminating the need for 3D spectacles
(enabling eye-contact and non-verbal gesture communication). Full
parallax multi-perspective lightfield 3D displays could also enhance
collaborations and shared understanding of multi-layer 3D data sets in
other application areas, including military intelligence, medical
training, molecular research, mineral geology, and similar civil
big-data environments.     Research towards these emerging eye-strain
and nausea-free FoLD systems involves novel holographic, volumetric,
multi-planar depthcube, integral imaging, and other lightfield display
types which have been demonstrated as laboratory prototypes. Further
hardware and software maturation is necessary for successful technology
transition and commercialization. However, progress is currently
restrained by a lack of validated metrics (physical and perceptual) and
by a lack of testing protocols based on realistic user content and
scenarios.  Rapid, inexpensive physical measurement methodologies are
required to guide research spirals, display calibration, and product
acceptance. An automated measurement approach is needed to reduce the
costs associated with making the large number of measurements required
to describe display depth and lateral image quality from all pupil-pair
positions within a reasonably large (30x30-deg to 90x90-deg) image
viewing zone. Proposed approaches to FoLD metrology should address the
multidisciplinary nature of display test and evaluation (T &amp; E).
Human visual perception needs to be convincingly addressed in all new
physical (instrumental) measurement procedures.     Completely new
classes of display technology, like FoLD, have gone through a similar
phase. For example, the digital pixelated flat panel displays (FPD)
class of 2D displays went through this metrics and metrology development
 phase in the early 1990s. This development was led in DoD by AFRL. By
about 2004, the main 2D display technology on the planet (by units
shipped and dollar sales) transitioned from the analog cathode ray tube
(CRT) class to the FPD class. This epochal shift from CRTs to FPDs could
 not have occurred without the FPD T &amp; E methodologies and
standards. The overall objective of this topic is to expedite a similar
transition in 3D displays from the S3D class to the FoLD class.
Performance metrics for physical measurements on FoLD systems include
analogues to those developed for 2D displays: luminance, luminance
contrast color uniformity, resolution, extinction ratio, refresh rate
and distortion. Novel metrics needing to be added for the FoLD 3D class
include depth acuity, depth contrast sensitivity, and full parallax
commanded by head position in the lightfield. Special attention should
be paid to calibration schemes and to sampling schemes to adequately
describe display performance. New metrics may be proposed for the
comparison of 2D, S3D and FoLD systems.  Standards for FoLD 3D test and
evaluation are incomplete; their development and vetting for inclusion
in the display metrology standard maintained by the Society for
Information Display (SID) is a secondary goal of this topic.      No
government facilities or equipment will be provided.     PHASE I:
Develop test and evaluation methodology for holographic and other light
field 3D displays. Design an automated procedure for measuring the
quality of FoLD systems. Deliverables shall include a review of
literature and relevant technologies, a proposed strategy for optimizing
 the automated measurement procedure, a mature system design, and a
draft handbook for FoLD test and evaluation.      PHASE II:  Build and
deliver the display measurement system designed in Phase I. Verify by
demonstration that the measurement system is suitable for FoLD 3D
visualization research, system calibration, and product acceptance
testing. Obtain industry feedback and expand Phase draft handbook into
a"Handbook FoLD Test &amp; Evaluation Methodologies."PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS:  Develop a formal standard for FoLD test &amp; evaluation
methodology to enable transition and transfer of full-parallax 3D
displays to military and civilian applications ranging from geospatial
representations to modeling to design. Publish the standard via an
international display metrology committee.",

Combat Operations Training",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate a
voice-enabled intelligent agent to improve the realism of integrated
combat operations training and rehearsal within the Air Support
Operations Center.       DESCRIPTION:  In today"s asymmetric combat
operations, the integration and interoperability of various mission
areas of the Command and Control domain is growing. The state-of-the-art
 in training and deployment preparation for these constituent mission
areas is to train the missions as separate stovepiped communities using
live and simulated assets that are not consistently available. There are
 some limited opportunities for the various communities to interact with
 one another via a distributed network, but the availability of
appropriate technologies, other players and timely scheduling of
activities jeopardizes persistence in distributed training for these
mission areas today. This topic is seeking a method to establish
capabilities for each mission area to realistically and routinely train
as if they were interoperating as they would do in theater. One of the
most salient missing pieces to achieve realistic training is the lack of
 realistic voice-enabled agents that can regularly play the role of
other trainees, wingmen, entities, and coordination agencies. The
current state-of- the-art in linguistic modeling does not provide a
mechanism for intelligent agents to communicate in a realistic manner
using voice within simulation environments. Voice-enabled intelligent
agents are typically developed in a closed environment that does not
take systems like military simulators into account. The voice agent
developed in this effort must be designed using industry standards to
effectively interact within a simulation environment. During Phase I the
 voice agent should be a position that is either within the ASOC or that
 externally coordinates with the ASOC. This effort will develop a
flexible voice-enabled agent technology to support training in and
across the mission areas identified above. This effort will develop
methods to capture real-world communication and coordination instances
and develop software models for agents and teammates that can
realistically communicate and coordinate training events as though human
 players were present. While we envision the developed agents from this
effort to improve the realism of training in these mission areas
directly, there is also a great potential that these agents can also
provide realistic communication instances for an integrated Live,
Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) deployment preparation and training
capability for the constituent communities of practice.      PHASE I:
This phase will identify content related to the ASOC internal or
external operators for the development effort. In addition, Phase I will
 develop a rudimentary proof-of-concept desktop exemplar of the training
 and rehearsal concept to be fully developed in the Phase II effort.
Develop preliminary transition plan.      PHASE II:  Prioritize missions
 for scenario and content development. Evaluate scenarios in the
environment focusing initially in the interaction between aircraft,
ASOCs, and JTACs on the ground, then RPA coord and other air traffic
control and coord entities as synthetic players. Evaluations will
quantify training effectiveness and mission readiness enhancement
resulting from the environment. Training transfer to live events and
exercises will be assessed. Refine transition plan.      PHASE III DUAL
USE APPLICATIONS:  Uniquely capable and cost-effective training and
rehearsal capability that can be included as a part of live and virtual
training and rehearsal, which does not exist today for operational
combat training. No similar approach to train multi-role and other
manned\/unmanned aircraft.",

        "topic_name": "Adaptive Screen Materials for Image Projection",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Research and develop a means of
changing the gain of screen materials used for front-projected imagery
in large-scale immersive simulation environments.       DESCRIPTION:  In
 immersive training simulation environments, the primary stimuli
presented to participants consists of visual imagery or cues. Some
large-scale simulation environments are configured such that the imagery
 is front-projected on screens that (except for the floor) may partially
 or fully surround trainees. Some such environments are configured as
large spherical or hemispherical domes in which the profile of the
screen surface describes a compound curve. Such environments may be used
 for training both day and night operations. When training for day
operations, a screen with high gain (e.g., high surface reflectivity),
coupled with a set of projectors having high output, may be desirable
for credible immersion. When training for night operations, participants
 may employ real night vision imaging devices ("NVGs") to view night
scenes projected on the screen, e.g., the NVGs are stimulated by the
projected scene and produce intensified imagery. Ideally the intensified
 imagery seen in the simulator will credibly match the imagery that the
NVGs would produce when used in a corresponding operational night
environment. At the same time, the projected night scene must appear
realistic to the unaided eye. NVGs are very sensitive, so when using
screen materials with high gain, filters must be used or projector
settings must be changed to greatly reduce scene brightness. Such
approaches may result in color artificialities and\/or projectors
operating near the extreme lower end of their brightness gamut, causing
limited remaining available dynamic range and imagery that appears
unrealistic to the unaided eye. A front projection screen surface having
 very low gain for night environments would allow image projectors to
operate at more normal settings, permitting greater dynamic range while
also giving imagery appearing more realistic both through the NVG and to
 the unaided eye.      Current state-of-the-art does not allow for day
and night (to include NVGs) training in the same immersive space, it
requires two separate environments. This effort is focused on developing
 an adaptive screen material that can be leveraged for both day and
night operations. Space and cost realities may prevent the luxury of two
 separate simulators, one dedicated only to day environments and the
other only to night; so, a non-emissive, non-specular screen with gain
that is rapidly and continuously variable between high and low values by
 external means, somewhat like a chameleon skin, is desirable. Such gain
 must be uniform across the entire screen surface and must not vary with
 viewing angle. Simulators in which this screen surface might be used
could be deployable, and could be configured as domes ranging from three
 to five meters in diameter. In some simulators, the screen surface
could be made of a tight-weave fabric mounted over tubular frames, the
smooth concave surface being formed by differential air pressure.
Therefore, a screen with adjustable gain that is foldable and that can
conform to compound curves (segment of a sphere) is desirable.
Manufacturability, scalability, durability and affordability also are
desirable features. Means of adjusting gain must not constitute any
hazard to participants operating in such environments, nor may such
means generate RF noise.       PHASE I:  Research, define, compare and
document technical capabilities and options. Determine a screen material
 concept capable of meeting all requirements in"Description"for
immersive day, twilight and night simulation environments. Develop
preliminary transition plan and business case analysis.      PHASE II:
Demonstrate the proposed Phase I design concept with a prototype screen
having an area of at least 3 square meters and that is scalable.
Appearance of the imagery as viewed both with NVGs and by the unaided
eye over a dynamic range spanning day to night is a key consideration.
Submit a complete technical report documenting all work under the
effort. Refine transition plan and business case analysis.      PHASE

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate tools that
will allow subject matter experts (SMEs), instructional system designers
 (ISDs) and software engineers to produce simulation-based intelligent
tutors and adaptive instruction more efficiently.        DESCRIPTION:
The impact of intelligent tutoring systems and other forms of adaptive
training technologies for promoting learning and subsequent performance
has been shown a number of times in traditional classroom content areas
such as reading and mathematics. Several applications of adaptive
training have also been attempted with some success in more operational
contexts such as electronics troubleshooting, power systems maintenance,
 and, most recently, in information technology troubleshooting and
maintenance (see Fletcher, 1988; McCarthy, 2008). However, the
development time associated with the creation of these tutors and
adaptive training is significant and to date has involved a substantial
amount of machine and knowledge engineering to achieve the desired end
results. Moreover, high sustainment costs associated with retooling the
content layers in these systems as operational domains change, as well
as a lack of open source tools to facilitate growth of content databases
 and to promote domain expert generation of new content, continue to
limit growth of these systems in the field. These issues, along with a
persistent emphasis on closed and proprietary"one-off"tools, content,
and architectures, has limited the broader application of intelligent
tutoring and adaptive training systems in the military and especially in
 more complex operational domains.  Prior work has made progress in the
use of machine learning (cf. Stevens-Adams, et al., 2010) or high-order
languages (cf. Cohen, et al., 2005; St. Amant, et al., 2005; Ritter, et
al., 2006) to reduce development and sustainment costs. However, these
approaches have characteristics that limit their suitability in a
military training environment. For example, SMEs have to take
significant time off task to learn the systems needed to create and
update content, and there is still a significant dependence on
proprietary methods that are costly and keep content from being more
open and sharable across similar domains. This effort will address a
number of these limitations by creating tools for authoring and
maintaining adaptive training systems. These tools should provide
intuitive and easy to use methods to allow domain SMEs and other
instructional design and content developers with relatively little
experience in the underpinnings of tutors or adaptive training system
architectures to develop and sustain training applications that promote
the benefits associated with this kind of instruction and training.
Further, the tools should assist the developers in the application of
best practices in instructional science and events of instruction such
that the system is both content and instructionally valid. Finally, the
developer tools must permit a more open and sharable design for content
and instruction such that content and instructional approaches can be
generalized across similar content spaces and training contexts.
PHASE I:  Summarize best practices\/applications in intelligent tutoring
 and adaptive training. Identify key common and unique features. Conduct
 a capabilities\/gap analysis. Develop recommendations and a design
specification for a tool set addressing the gaps while supporting more
open and user friendly training design and delivery. Identify a content
domain of relevance for a Phase II demonstration.      PHASE II:
Develop and demonstrate the tool set in the content domain identified in
 Phase I. Implement the tools in an adaptive training exemplar and
conduct user and training impact assessments. Refine tools and the
exemplar, identify a domain to evaluate the generalizability and reuse
of content and instructional approaches and conduct initial evaluations.
 Document impact of the exemplars on development and sustainment costs
and on trainee performance.       PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  The
tools will improve training dev\/delivery response times in military
training squadrons. The tools permit a broader use in complex civilian
areas such as emergency response and manned and unmanned border security
 and infrastructure monitoring where adaptive instruction is sorely
needed.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a DIS\/HLA gateway to permit
 a variety of non-simulation standardized trainers to integrate with and
 operate on the Distributed Mission Operations Network (DMON) for
training exercises.        DESCRIPTION:  The Air Force uses a variety of
 training systems and simulators for space Command and Control (C2)
operator training. These systems and simulators are"stove-piped,"in that
 they used different hardware, operating systems, networking
capabilities, and proprietary software. In addition, none of these
systems are Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) or High Level
Architecture (HLA) standard system configurations. Finally, each one
differs considerably in its capabilities to support training. These
differences drive high development and maintenance costs and also
prohibit these systems from integrating with and operating on the DMON.
The DMON is the USAF standard distributed simulation network. Further,
these systems cannot be brought into the broader USAF and Air Education
and Training Command (AETC) training enterprise architecture where a
standard approach for operator training that employs an extensible
architecture and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) personal computer (PC)
hardware and operating systems, is required. A current attempt to
address some of the differences issues and to move toward a common
training system structure is called the Standard Space Trainer or SST.
The SST has been designed to facilitate the development and delivery of
training services on an enterprise, to provide support to the
coordination and conduct of training, and to facilitate content and
system integration as additional services with a software development
kit and a published applications interface specification. However, even
the SST is not capable of participating in distributed training and
rehearsal events for different space operations communities. With the
costs to modify legacy training systems being untenable, there is a
substantial opportunity exists to develop a DIS and HLA compliant
gateway that will permit these systems, including the SST, to continue
to operate natively, but to pass data to and from the gateway that would
 do the translation to and from the larger DMON enterprise. The
developed gateway and software must be compliant with the Joint
Federation Object Model (FOM) Specifications, IEEE Distributed
Interactive Simulation (DIS) \/ High Level Architecture (HLA) standards,
 DoD network, connectivity and interoperability standards (IAW AFI
36-2251, Air Force Training System Management, 5 Jun 2009), and the
current DMON standards.      PHASE I:  Conduct a training systems and
content analysis of candidates for DMO integration. For these
candidates, conduct a training mission analysis to characterize data
interfaces needed and alignment of training system functions with DMO
events of merit. Develop a data specification for the types of data
translation the gateway will need to accomplish to support accredited
training across the DMON.      PHASE II:  Develop and demonstrate a
gateway that allows the candidate training systems to interoperate in
DMO training events. The gateway should permit crews to interact with
the combined trainer\/DMO environment in real time, reacting to stimulus
 and also providing stimulus to others as part of the larger training
event. Phase II will also demonstrate student performance tracking
across training environments in DMO events.      PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: Military: Gateway permits a broader range of legacy
training systems to be part of larger enterprises. Commercial: Common
data exchanges allowing a variety of non-industry-standard environments

Automated Sensor Functions",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop\/evaluate a multiple
unmanned air vehicle interface prototype that increases transparency of
automated sensor systems and enables intuitive operator interactions to
direct\/tailor sensor operations in response to dynamic mission
requirements.       DESCRIPTION:  Automation is becoming a critical
element of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)
operations. Automatic target recognition in unmanned robotic combat
vehicles has been particularly successful. Reliance on automated sensor
features will become even more critical with the vision of one operator
(or crew) simultaneously supervising multiple unmanned air vehicles
(UAVs). Existing interfaces are inadequate for controlling multiple
UAV\/sensor systems. Moreover, research to date has focused on
interfaces for supervisory control of the flight of multiple vehicles,
not the associated sensor operations. Advanced sensors support a variety
 of missions such as real-time identification of forces, finding targets
 in cluttered environments, and aiding battle damage assessment. The
interface to the sensor systems needs to enable the operator to
efficiently and flexibly interact with the automation in order to refine
 the sensor"s automation level, change sensor processing
algorithms\/parameters, and delegate new tasks and constraints based on
the current situation. Specific examples include: a) operator contending
 with target signature variations by refining the target\/sensor
acquisition parameters (e.g., aspect, depression, etc.) and b) operator
needing to rapidly insert a target identification request on-the-fly.
The design approach needs to support such interactions in envisioned
multi-UAV\/sensor applications. In sum, the present effort focuses on
developing a flexible, intuitive interface between a UAV operator and
electro-optical\/infrared (EO\/IR) sensors, rather than developing
sensor algorithms or hardware. Successful completion of Phase I will
require delivery of a technical report that describes the selected
representative UAV sensor automation system(s), the associated
display\/control features that have been designed and evaluated, and
anticipated shortfalls, limitations, and tradeoffs of each solution(s). A
 feasibility demonstration is desirable, but not required.
Completion of this effort will involve identifying which parameters of a
 representative automated sensor algorithm\/system can be adjusted, as
well as which are the strongest contributors to improved UAV mission
effectiveness across a variety of conditions. The effort should address,
 at a minimum, EO\/IR sensors for whatever UAV
platform\/task\/mission(s) the proposer chooses to focus the interface
design\/evaluation. (Any simulated or representative sensor system
employed in support of this effort should maintain data at an
unclassified level. Proposer should not require any government
materials, equipment, data, or facilities.) There are also other factors
 useful to consider in the design of an operator\/sensor interface.
First, there will be unique challenges to supervise multi-target
prosecution and aggregate the findings of sensors across multiple UAVs
performing a collaborative mission. Since supervisory control of
multiple UAVs will be cognitively demanding, the interface will need to
provide an intuitive and rapid means of tailoring the
sensors"functionality, as well as adequate visualization into the
sensors"processing to maintain operator mode awareness of automation
state, in addition to general situation awareness. Support tools that
assist the operator in authoring and validating sensor modifications may
 also be useful. Any decision support aid needs to provide information
when required by the operator (e.g., projecting the outcome of candidate
 adjustments, allowing evaluation of alternate courses of action, and
identifying potential problems). Moreover, the interface needs to
mitigate excessive workload in interacting with the sensor and avoid
permitting unsafe or ineffective modifications. Constraints on
bandwidth, as well as issues associated with highly automated systems
(e.g., sensor"s reliability and operator complacency), are also
important to consider. Another objective is to determine how best to
optimize operator expectations and tolerances for error.       PHASE I:
 Design and evaluate candidate display and control features for an
operator\/sensor interface appropriate for single operator control of
multi-unmanned air vehicles\/sensor systems. Generate a final report
that describes the interface solution(s), evaluation results, and an
experimental plan to establish usability improvements in Phase II. A
feasibility demonstration is desirable, but not required.      PHASE II:
  For the best approach identified in Phase I, develop a prototype and
perform iterative testing and refinement cycles, culminating in a
proof-of-concept interface for multi-UAV\/sensor applications. Conduct
validation studies of the interface in high-fidelity simulations or
operational tests to demonstrate payoffs in interaction flexibility,
interaction speed, error reduction, workload management, etc.      PHASE
 III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Military applications include intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance exploitation; mission planning; and
sensor applications in unmanned air, ground and sea systems. Commercial
applications include surveillance for homeland security, law
enforcement, and industrial security.",

morphological and functional evaluation of the retina",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a software platform capable
of integrating information collected over repeated experiments and from
disparate sensors to facilitate the measurement of the physiological
response of ocular-tissue to damaging levels of light.
DESCRIPTION:  The technological fields of ocular imaging and visual
functional testing are rapidly evolving as independent approaches for
the investigation of ocular pathophysiology which can be applied to the
investigation of laser damaged eyes. Imaging modalities such as the
fundus camera, scanning laser ophthalmoscope, optical coherence
tomography, hyperspectral, speckle and fluorescence imagers each reveal
different pieces of information which need to be evaluated together as a
 whole in order to form a complete picture of the physiological
processes which are modulated within the eye as a result of noxious
levels of exposure to light.  Furthermore, physiological changes, such
as oxygen consumption which can be revealed through combined imaging,
need to be spatially and temporally related to loss in visual function
in order to fully appreciate the biochemical cascades and neurological
consequences of light damage (Muqit, 2011). Additionally, information
from visual functional testing techniques, such as multifocal pattern
electroretinography, needs to be correlated to image data with a high
degree of spatial precision. Therefore, the Air Force seeks the
development of a software platform which facilitates integration of data
 from all relevant retinal imaging modalities used in the investigation
of retinal laser damage and associated visual function testing. The
software application should recognize and automatically import data
presented to it in industry standard formats and also provide a
framework for importation of custom image and functional-test data
files.       Customized software which accomplishes some of the desired
integration detailed above has been published.  For example, images of
the macula collected with spectral domain optical coherence tomography
and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy have been used in conjunction
 with fundus-controlled microperimetry to create functional maps of the
macula. (Charbel Issa et al., 2010; Troeger et al., 2010) However,
greater functionality to include advanced, customizable preprocessing
techniques for noise and motion artifact suppression, plus edge
enhancement techniques and tunable match criteria for image fusion based
 on retinal features, as well as gradients in illumination and
reflectance, are needed. Furthermore, difference imaging which
highlights subtle changes from baseline images should be enabled to
allow automated retinal layer segmentation and characterization of laser
 lesions.     Merging and manipulating image sets of multiple scales,
dimensions, magnification factors and total field of view will be very
computationally intensive; therefore, the use of parallel processing
schemes which leverage CUDA and\/or other scalable multiprocessor
approaches will be required.      PHASE I:  Create a software
development plan which identifies i\/o formats associated with 2D and 3D
 imaging modalities and complementary visual function tests; delineates
desirable preprocessing capabilities for noise reduction in native
images; details technical approaches for image registration and data
fusion; defines the graphical user interface for data management and
outlines verification procedures.      PHASE II:  This effort will
include creation of a complete software specification, beta code
generation, execution on a relevant parallel processor platform and
documentation with a detailed design description and compilation
dependencies for all algorithms and data structures. Finally, a
verification test plan will be executed with representative retinal
image data (government provided or approved) to ensure all the
requirements identified in the software specification have been
adequately addressed.        PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  Beyond
the study of changes in physiological function of the retina resulting
from light induced damage, this technology will have widespread
application to ophthalmic medical practice in general.",

 in Natural Environments",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop hardware and\/or software
tools to accurately determine full body segment positions and
orientations of a person performing various activities in natural indoor
 and outdoor environments.        DESCRIPTION:  Full-body human motion
capture has a variety of important applications within the Air Force and
 Department of Defense, as well as in numerous commercial industries,
such as athletics, health care, and entertainment.  AFRL applications
include the creation of biofidelic avatar-based training scenarios and
the collection of"ground-truth"data for research on human surveillance
and tracking methods. Natural settings, including varying terrain,
backgrounds, and clothing, are important to AFRL applications, where
multiple sensor modalities are used coincidently (i.e.,"sensor fusion").
 For example, motion capture can serve as the ground truth for
synchronized radar and video collections, where the background and
clothing worn are critical to replicating in-field video feeds and the
outdoor terrain is critical to replicating in-field radar returns.
Current full-body motion capture technology has limitations that inhibit
 its use in natural or real-world settings. The current gold standard in
 accuracy is optical motion capture, which relies on line of sight
between multiple cameras with light emitting strobes and
retro-reflective markers placed on the subject. Optical systems are,
however, cumbersome to move and cannot be used with typical attire.
Other motion capture technologies exist, each with their own
limitations. Electromagnetic sensors provide accurate orientation and
position, but are greatly limited by the range of the generated magnetic
 field. Inertial measure units (IMUs) increase portability, but are
limited to orientation measurements only. Markerless motion capture
methods focus on fitting a model to a silhouette extracted from 2-D
video but are often inaccurate for precise motion analysis.  Additional
information, such as from a depth sensor (e.g., Microsoft Kinect) can be
 used to provide some 3-D information.     While advances in these areas
 have shown promise as a replacement to optical motion capture, to date
commercial products that provide sufficient accuracy are still
unavailable. AFRL is seeking innovative hardware and software tools that
 will result in the development of a motion capture technology that is:
1) mobile (can be relatively easily moved to various locations), 2)
compatible with a variety of clothing, and 3) not restrictive of natural
 motion (e.g., untethered\/wireless). In particular, we are interested
in tools that fuse different hardware modalities. For example, an
IMU-based motion capture system might be augmented with markerless
motion capture techniques or a local positioning system to create a
single motion capture system capable of accurate orientation and
position tracking.      PHASE I:  Develop an initial concept hardware
and software design in order to accurately determine human segment
positions and orientations under clothing in a natural environment.
Demonstrate the ability to design and implement the technology through
proof of concept.      PHASE II:  Develop and demonstrate a fully
functional prototype of the hardware\/software system. Integrate all
hardware so that it can be controlled from a single software interface.
Validate the system"s accuracy through laboratory experiments.
PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  The technology will allow the military
 to collect ground-truth human motion data in realistic operational
environments to assist in human threat detection. The technology will
provide researchers and doctors with a motion capture system that can
record motion in realistic settings.",

        "topic_name": "Synthetic Task Environment for Primary &amp;amp;
Secondary Assessment in Trauma Care",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To develop and demonstrate a
synthetic task environment for primary and secondary assessment in
trauma care. This includes the capacity for creating\/editing scenarios,
 recording performance and simulation data, and interoperating with
external sims.       DESCRIPTION:  Trauma care is an essential skill for
 medical professionals in the Department of Defense. The most critical
aspect of trauma care is primary and secondary assessment of patients at
 first encounter. These assessments are made during every trauma case,
and represent the first opportunity for medical professionals to impact
long-term patient prognosis. Patient outcomes depend not only on the
effectiveness of these assessments (doing them right), but also on the
efficiency (doing them quickly). Providing opportunities to rehearse and
 hone these skills in a virtual environment will improve outcomes for
warfighters on the battlefield by ensuring that the underlying
competencies are well-learned and routinized to maximize the likelihood
of a positive outcome for patients.     Importantly, it has been shown
that medical professionals who are experts in trauma care do perform
this initial assessment more quickly and accurately than novices and
training leads to better performance (Holcomb, et al., 2002). At the
same time, training opportunities are limited for many of the injuries
that may be sustained on the battlefield, creating a need that can be
partially addressed with simulation (Bruce, Bridges, &amp; Holcomb,
2003). High-fidelity medical mannequins provide a valuable opportunity,
but lower-fidelity training options may provide value for rehearsing
many of the fundamental skills necessary to perform assessments quickly
and accurately. Currently, such lower-fidelity environments are lacking.
 Lower-fidelity simulators have the potential to increase the efficiency
 of training by allowing for the rehearsal of critical skills that do
not require the high-fidelity environment. That is, such technologies
allow for the evaluation and efficient leveraging of a family of
resources that provide the right level of fidelity for the training
requirements.     The Air Force Research Laboratory is interested in
virtual environments that can present medical professionals with trauma
scenarios where the critical steps of primary and secondary assessment
can be rehearsed. A useful simulation environment must be of sufficient
fidelity to provide opportunities for meaningful rehearsal of critical
skills and decision making.     To be of value in assessing the
development and maintenance of skills, the virtual environment must also
 support the collection and recording of critical simulation and
performance data and events. These data must be of high enough
resolution and detail to permit after-action review and assessment, as
well as replay of critical events and sequences. The simulation must
also have the capacity to interoperate with external software to allow
bi-directional communication of data. That is, the simulation must be
able to both communicate state\/event information to external components
 and be able to accept inputs (e.g., actions) as well. The critical
aspect of this is to identify a standard communication protocol for
passing this information into and out of the environment, preferably
using an open-source standard. Finally, it should support authoring
through an interface that can be used by medical subject matter experts
to create and modify scenarios.      PHASE I:  The Phase I deliverable
will be a prototype system demonstrating the feasibility for a virtual
environment to support primary and secondary trauma assessment. It
should include a plan for practical development and deployment, and
demonstrate appropriate data capture and interoperability.      PHASE
II:  The Phase II deliverable will build upon the Phase I prototype to
develop, demonstrate, and validate a synthetic task environment (STE)
that supports rehearsal of primary and secondary trauma assessment. The
STE must include the capacity for creating and editing scenarios, and
well as support interoperability with external software. The system
should run on standard desktop computing software.      PHASE III DUAL
USE APPLICATIONS:  Can be leveraged for training interventions for
trauma care that can prepare medical professionals for the unique
situations and challenges associated with casualties in operational
contexts. Simulations that help to prepare civilian medical
professionals for the most severe cases they will see.",

 and Denial Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for C4ISR
Networks",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a cyber-training environment
 that represents current actual environments and can be easily adapted
by the users to support different training requirements.
DESCRIPTION:  Cyber warfare is no longer a nascent domain with few
players and negligible consequences. In the past two decades, state and
non-state actors have repeatedly demonstrated the capability and intent
to exercise their influence through network operations. In addition,
cyber security is recognized not only as a military domain, but as a
civilian threat documented by President Obama"s 2009 Cyber Security
Initiative (White House, 2009). Effective cyber security training is
vital to develop the cyber force capable of protecting our interests at
home and abroad.     Currently Air Force cyber training relies primarily
 on instructor-led classroom (stand-up) training, rudimentary exercises
and scenarios conducted on previous-generation systems. Given the low
level of technical complexity, current training systems are configurable
 by the instructors, and can be reset at will in the event of a failure
or crash. These training networks are modeled after operational Air
Force networks and include diverse elements such as routers, switches,
Windows\/Linux OSs, proxies, and firewalls through virtualization;
however, they lack incorporation of the complexities of today"s
real-world environments (system load, number of actors, and breadth of
applications). Additionally, there is no inherent capability within
current training systems to effectively model and enable pattern
recognition analysis and synthesis.      The current state-of-the-art
technologies are largely centered on individual subject-based learning,
platforms, and scenario-based war-gaming. While there is a vast array of
 products on the market today (e.g., gaming) that enable\/support these
learning areas, there is no known single technological solution which
meets the Air Force need for a virtualized network environment that will
 integrate realistic network analysis, and attack and defense scenarios,
 into a deployable, modular platform to serve as a training tool for Air
 Force cyber operators.          To fill the gap between the current
state-of-the-art and the desired end-state, research is required to
advance the science in the areas of working within highly complex
virtual environments, and when fielded includes the capability to
incorporate evolving cognitive science developments.     The final
training system should be virtualized in a manner that is compatible
with the current Air Force Net and easy to deploy and reset. The
training system should closely replicate the complexities of current
real-world cyber environments. The network should include realistic
traffic generation that is modifiable by an instructor. The network
should represent a variety of devices and protocols. The system should
include network attack and defense scenarios based on present-day
exploits and tactics. Scenarios should be adaptive and include multiple
learning pathways for differing skill levels. Scenarios should include
simulated actors performing network attack and network defense
functions. Instructors should be able to efficiently author new
scenarios.      The result will be the ability to effectively model and
enable pattern recognition analysis and synthesis. The system should
enable the development of skills to mitigate adversarial attempts at
blocking access for obtaining any critical threat information (e.g.,
information and INTEL of operations, communication, computer networks,
documents of strategy and tactics, organizational diagrams via wired or
wireless). The capabilities of this product should also include allowing
 for forensic analysis. The system capability should include the ability
 to simulate the effect of a variety of denial and deception tactics
including cyber-attacks, embedding viruses in networks, or emplacing
adversary sensors within Blue systems to obtain intelligence
information, implement denial of service attacks, damages, or complete
destruction of communication and computer networks.      PHASE I:
Define the system requirements. Identify appropriate components to
create a system design. Analyze the software necessary to enable the
system to work. Propose a design to be built and demonstrated during
Phase II. Demonstration of laboratory breadboard prototype hardware
during Phase I is highly desired, but not required.      PHASE II:
Build and demonstrate the training system in a relevant environment. The
 system must meet requirements as stated in description above.
Additionally, design should show significant consideration for human
factors, including, but not limited to: flexibility, modularity of
design, adaptive to changing environments, tailorability and inclusion
of cognitive science advancements. Level of the system by the end of
Phase II is TRL 6, and preferably TRL 7.      PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS:  Tools and technologies for cyber defense training are
marketable and sought after in both the U.S. government and private
industry.",

 enhance multi-agency collaboration in response to world situations
including foreign and non-government agencies. Improve information
sharing to support diplomatic, information, military, and economic
efforts.        DESCRIPTION:  This effort aims to improve collaborative
decision making for Political, Military, Economic, Social,
Infrastructure and Information systems (PMESII) and Diplomatic,
Information, Military, and Economic (DIME) efforts. The technology
developed on this effort will provide a human-computer interface
(envisioning software only) that encapsulates information and tools
needed for PMESII decision making.      It should be able to
create"mission pictures"at multiple levels of abstraction for decision
makers in the field, at theater levels, and at higher levels. It should
be able to transform data into a meaningful story that can be understood
 at a glance in many cases and provide representation of information
quality to gage trust.     The encapsulation of PMESII information
sources may result in a common operational picture (COP) that can (1)
store, aggregate, and display data; 2) be flexible, modifiable, and
extensible for multiple heterogeneous information streams; (3) support
third-party capability integration; and (4) be license free. The
concepts of the COP and related User-Defined Operational Picture (UDOP)
are described more in the reference below by Mulgund and Landsman. As
this capability will support crisis situations, as well as everyday
actions, it will be important to strike an optimal balance of ease-
of-use, flexibility, and decision support.     In addition to workflow
support, the system should also have built-in collaboration capabilities
 between players who have a role in decision making and planning. PMESII
 decisions, and the actions that follow, cannot be performed in
isolation. They require input from many diverse players including
military, governmental, non-governmental, and foreign. This COP may
serve as a collaboration environment in itself; however, other types of
collaboration tools may be developed or leveraged. Shared situation
awareness and coordination of distributed decision-makers through
collaborative methodologies will help to avoid misunderstanding or
conflicting actions.       One customer base for this research are Air
and Space Operations Centers (AOCs); however, the capability could also
find its way into other agencies involved in PMESII processes. The
information sources, within databases (digital) and organizations
(humans), are vast, so it will be important for the contractor to
specify what sources they plan to use for the demonstration system. Note
 that the information sources chosen are not nearly as critical as the
human-centric technologies developed.     Currently, decision makers do
not have a unified capability for DIME operations. Even if they would
have access to the tools that are available, they probably would not
have the time to learn and use them. The PRIME system described in
Lowrance &amp; Murdock (2009) aimed to"support (PMESII) analysts and
strategy planners in allowing them to directly explore the full range of
 consequences associated with candidate courses of action (COAs)."Also
today there is significant reliance on phone calls between people with
established relationships, rather than people who may be most relevant
to the situation. Voice communication will continue to be critical but
is not necessarily the most effective or efficient collaboration method
for each phase of decision making. Joint doctrine recognizes that
the"sharing of information with relevant United States government (USG)
agencies, foreign governments and security forces, interorganizational
partners, non-government organizations (NGOs), and members of the
private sector, has proved vital in recent operations"(Joint Publication
 3-0, Joint Operations, page III-14).      PHASE I:  Phase I shall
include a storyboard outlining the display layouts and user
interactions. The emphasis in this phase is on the design and not a
prototype. A good human-computer interface should focus far more on the
user needs than the software implementation issues. That said, a plan to
 implement the concepts in Phase II including software tools needed and
system integration should be provided.     PHASE II:  The researcher
shall design, develop, and demonstrate a prototype tool that implements
the Phase I methodologies applicable to a selected operations center.
The technology development shall have a goal of technology readiness
level (TRL) 6 at the end of Phase II. The researcher shall also detail
the plan for the Phase III effort.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:

        "topic_name": "Expand Data Transfer Rates within Legacy Aircraft
 (ERLA)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop the capability to grow
legacy aircraft mission capabilities by increasing the
intercommunications data rate within the aircraft to at least 100 Mbps
without the addition of new wire or cable infrastructure.
DESCRIPTION:  The intercommunication data rate (IDR) of legacy aircraft
is a limiting factor for transferring data between positions on the
vehicle. Current missions have not required an increase in these rates.
 However, future planned capabilities, such as Advanced Tactical Data
Links (ATDL), are highly likely to require a significant increase in
IDR. This problem will impact many legacy aircraft and will inhibit the
acceptance of new technologies by the respective program offices.
Retrofitting legacy aircraft with fiber optics or adding additional
signal transmission channel elements (e.g., copper wires or cables) is
absolutely NOT an option due to cost, depot time, and considerations of
space, weight and power. Wired deterministic data on MIL-STD-1553B, the
primary data bus of choice for military avionics in legacy aircraft, is 1
 Mbps per bus.[1] In order to support future planned capabilities, IDR
needs to be orders of magnitude higher. Non-deterministic video triax
cables were designed for low-resolution sensors and displays, limiting
upgrades planned for cockpit vision systems and future programs. Prior
efforts have demonstrated the potential for increasing bandwidth over
MS1553B cabling.[2] At least one effort has demonstrated the possibility
 of increasing bandwidth on legacy aircraft using power lines, as well.
This topic seeks further improvements in using all physical channels,
especially in concert, to increase intra-aircraft data throughput.
Several worldwide consumer electronics consortia, such as the Homeplug
Powerline Alliance, Multimedia over Coax Alliance, and the HomeGrid
Forum, have formed over the past several years that create ever more
powerful transceiver card sets and equipment to increase data transfer
rates within homes and buildings and vehicles without adding any new
wiring or cables.[3] Leveraging these ever-more capable commercial
concepts and technologies could enable affordability, sustainability,
and technology refresh at such times as a particular aircraft program
office needs more bandwidth. Innovative research is needed to increase
intra-aircraft data bandwidth to over 100 Mbps\/channel (threshold) or
over 1 Gbps\/channel (objective), where the channels comprise the
currently installed complement of wiring, cables, and power lines.
Phase I ground testing should be sufficient (a) to validate the
technical approach and (b) to support both identification of legacy
fighter\/bomber program requirements that require flight testing and
development of a flight test plan.      Phase II ground testing should
result in prototype unit(s) that could be provided to a program office
for possible flight certification. Support for"flight test"during Phase
II is anticipated to include basic test of non-interference with
existing aircraft systems, some reliability tests, some tests of the
ease of installation, and a test of the ability to quickly shut off the
system if there is a problem. This could also consist of installing the
data transfer units and troubleshooting any data transfer problems as
needed. It is conceivable that the government would desire to conduct
these tests in conjunction with other previously scheduled flight tests
of fighter\/bomber aircraft. If that cannot be worked, piggy-backing on
flight tests of other Air Force vehicles will be explored. As a last
resort, the use of cooperative tests with civilian aircraft will be
considered. If no arrangements can be made, the small business will be
relieved of flight test support requirements in Phase II.      PHASE I:
 A high-speed interface design for installed wiring is to be designed
for avionics that takes into account reliability and maintainability
issues. Simulation measurements of the design should be used as much as
possible to demonstrate potential data rate improvements. A roadmap is
required describing the threshold and objective performance, with
product spirals shown as off-ramps.      PHASE II:  Prototypes
demonstrating the technology are to be developed, tested and delivered
along with a revised roadmap for Phase III commercialization and
transition. The Phase II prototypes should be sufficient to evaluate the
 potential to develop products to meet the needs for bandwidth growth in
 a range of military and civil applications. In addition, a draft
logistics plan must be delivered. Support a flight test by installing
the data transfer units and being available to troubleshoot problems.
   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  Military applications include all
defense aircraft, battle tanks, and many shipboard electronics. Need an
infrastructure accessible by defense integrators to obtain COTS boards.
Civil applications will be developed for video distribution markets,
including aircraft, trains, and homes\/buildings.",

roadmap, and working prototype that operationalizes Logistics Systems
Data Error Handling, Analytics, and Corrective Action Management
Activities.       DESCRIPTION:  Air Force IT system modernization
efforts continue to highlight the growing need for robust,
standards-based, open service-oriented architectures.  There is a
critical need to provide a foundational approach to complex data error
analysis, exception handling, and corrective action behaviors while
providing reliable and consistent analytics, integration, workflow, and
collaboration to support those behaviors.  Multiple initiatives and
programs require this type of solution within the Logistics Enterprise
and by allowing each to develop their own approach to error handling and
 resolution, they run the risk of developing redundant, divergent, and
potentially incompatible architectures that are costly to sustain.
Solution should include an extensible methodology, architecture and tool
 suite for identifying, resolving, reporting, and managing data
exceptions and errors that can be used across the Logistics Enterprise.
Solution should assume a common view of data and provide tailored
information to specific user groups, including differentiation between
master data and transaction layer services necessary for daily
operations. Solution should include analytics that facilitate root cause
 analysis of data anomalies. Strategic, operational and tactical points
of view must be considered in the proposed model.     This product must
address the following objectives:    Support creation of a global,
enterprise-wide framework sourced from non-standard, heterogeneous,
multi-organizational, distributed, centralized, and federated IT
systems.    Production of a strategic, operational, and tactical product
 roadmap, to include the integration with, and to, DoD and Air Force
data and metadata repositories.    A software solution that addresses,
at a tactical level, prioritization of transactions, transaction
definition changes, and corrective actions based on changing mission
needs.     The solution and commercially viable prototype must address
the following technical challenges:    Account for structured and
unstructured data.    Support scalable"product configuration"options and
 incremental fielding based on customized sizing, throughput,
partitioning, reliability, data model inputs and options.    Address the
 operational challenges of data synchronization, sequencing, drill
downs, periodicity and timeliness.    Address merging standards and best
 practices related to data collection and profiling methodologies, data
mining, data categorization, data correlation, and data error
resolution, to include reporting, measurement, and threshold monitoring.
    Extend emergent technologies that support features such as
rule-based engines; data Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) principles;
data hub\/master data management; segregation of duties; workflow and
notification management.    Integrate with existing"help
desk"structures, command specific escalation and release management
activities, Business Intelligence (BI) infrastructure and Root Cause
Analysis tools, and applicable Information Assurance and
Certification\/Accreditation laws, rules, and regulations.    Address
data problem identification, analysis\/corrective actions and the use of
 predictive analysis to uncover and mitigate data anomalies.    Propose
extensible best-of-breed standards, topologies, and architectures to
fulfill and field the recommended solution Air Force wide.      PHASE I:
  Submit a proof-of-concept architecture with concept paper, technology
design, software prototype, and Phase II build plan. Include solution
scenarios, realistic data sets, and technical issues\/risks. Prototype
software demonstrates use of configurable business rules\/innovative
data quality-related algorithms.      PHASE II:  Mature the prototype,
incorporate operational (transaction level) layered services, integrate
Master Data Management, extend predictive analysis, and demonstrate full
 solution capabilities using multidimensional data and complex business
scenarios. Deliver revisions to the conceptual framework, technology
design, and technical issues. Deliver solution-based training,

communication system supporting very high bandwidth communications for
the airborne and surface layers. Threshold: reliable long-distance
communication among moving platforms in wide variety of weather
conditions.       DESCRIPTION:  The purpose of this topic is to explore
innovative free space optical (FSO) based hardware and software
approaches and implementations leading to improved theater level
communications for increased warfighter situation awareness (SA) and
mission assurance.     The battlefield\/theater environment will require
 both air-to-air communication and air-to-surface (fixed and mobile)
communication. Aerial platforms will include: airborne reconnaissance,
command and control (C2) assets, UAV ranging in size and altitude from
Global Hawk to Shadow, and airships. Threshold required surface
platforms include fixed base installations, stationary military
vehicles, and slow-moving or static dismounts.     An early system
performance goal is for communication to moving ground vehicles, then
moving to air-ground and air-air combinations. Threshold performance is
for single link capability between platforms. Goal performance is for
platforms to have the capability to communicate with multiple platforms,
 as required, to execute multiple mission scenarios and satisfy the
desire to provide seamless, integrated net-centric capabilities to the
forward edge of the battlespace. Crosslink ranges between aerial
platforms should extend to greater than 200 km. Down\/Up link range from
 aerial to ground assets should be capable of ranges greater than 50 km.
 The data capacity for aerial-to-aerial crosslinks and aerial-to-ground
downlinks should be at least 10 Gb\/s with a goal of 40 Gb\/s. The data
capacity surface to aerial vehicle uplinks should be at least 10 Gb\/s.
The systems should support at least 1 GigE data inputs with a goal of
additionally supporting 10 GigE. Ability to handle additional inputs
such as digital data from RF links greater than 200 Mb\/s RF is a plus.
    The system should provide very high reliability in all weather
conditions, although certain threshold throughput limitations may be
reduced in defined difficult weather states. This is anticipated to
include a hybrid FSO\/RF approach for optical links impaired by very
high atmospheric attenuation. Other approaches, such as adaptive optics,
 will be considered. Reduced data throughput is acceptable in these
cases. The FSO system should incorporate techniques to allow high data
throughput even in times of high atmospheric turbulence. The system
designs must meet eye safety regulations for commercial aviation
altitudes and below.     The systems must provide means for
point-to-point (1:1) and multicast (1:many) communications, to include
multiple moving platforms operating in expected conditions (i.e.,
planned flight conditions, not to include emergency turning,
climb\/descent, or severe evasive actions).     The systems must be SWaP
 compatible with their respective aerial platform or ground asset.
Finally, low unit production cost, system reliability and mission
assurance will be key requirements.      PHASE I:  Demonstrate gigabyte
transfer and bi-directional gigabyte IP communications over a distance
of at least 2 miles, with one platform in motion (roll NLT 15, pitch NLT
 5, yaw NLT 3 degrees, elevation NLT 20', lateral motion NLT 15').
Detailed concept design to meet above performance. Address communication
 with LEO and GEO satellites from aerial and surface nodes. Provide
Phase II design.      PHASE II:  Complete critical design of the Phase
II lab prototype hardware including any additional required supporting
MS &amp; A. A network model and baseline network performance model will
be provided during Phase II. All proposed programs must include at least
 Phase II hardware for one air-to-air scenario and one air to ground
scenario. Fabricate the lab prototype to show level of performance
achieved compared to stated government goals including SWaP, reliability
 and portability, expected to be at TRL 5.        PHASE III DUAL USE

 integrated onto commercial aircraft or comparable equipment for dynamic
 airborne evaluations.  Following successful initial field testing,
initial end item platforms will be identified and the FSO products be
ruggedized for field operations.",

or more layers of Type 2 (software) virtualization within a Type 1
("bare metal") Hypervisor infrastructure which uses introspection to
foil virtualization-aware malware escape attempts.       DESCRIPTION:
Modern malware (viruses, Trojans, etc.) will attempt to adapt to the
environment they are executed in. For instance, many versions of modern
malware are able to determine if they are being run within a virtualized
 machine due to measurable differences in performance, configuration
and\/or behavior between virtualized and physical platforms. This is
commonly done for several different malicious purposes, such as
attempting to deceive potential investigation attempts, or in order to
escape from within a virtualized system to affect the underlying code,
among other possibilities. In the second case, attempted escape from
virtualization is an obvious risk to the provider of the virtualization,
 as well as any other virtualized systems being provided on the same
hardware.      In order to add additional defensive capabilities to
improve attempts to close every potential gap in virtualization"s
emulation of normal operational environments, the creation of
multiple-layer virtualization with awareness of what happens in which
layer of the virtualization is desired.      In this architecture,
malicious content would be allowed to attempt to escape from within one
layer of virtualization, yet leave the host system unaffected.
Specifically, if any behaviors beyond those few needed to operate the
Type 2 virtualization are detected in this (or potentially other layers
of virtualization beyond the initial), it can fairly be assumed that
there is malicious behavior happening which should be stopped and\/or
investigated, in accordance to the risk acceptance of the organization
providing the virtualization.       PHASE I:  Build a Type-1 hypervisor
with introspection containing a Type-2 hypervisor with introspection.
Show a proof of concept indicating the Type-1 hypervisor stopping
functioning if any unexpected behaviors occur outside the Type-2
hypervisor.      PHASE II:  Further harden and instrument the

information from cradle to grave by leveraging process level

reduce malware propagation and improve access control, among other
useful features.       DESCRIPTION:  Process level virtualization (such
as Bromium"s"micro virtualization,"FreeBSD"Jails"or Qubes
OS""AppVM,"among others) creates a virtual sandbox around chosen
processes which prevent them from communicating with other processes
other than in explicitly defined ways. This capability is potentially
very useful for protecting the confidentiality and integrity of various
of these processes and the information within them. Extended to an
information work flow, these capabilities could support the assurance of
 information from cradle to grave.     Thus the challenge is to ensure
protected data and information is made available to all relevant users
via an assured process level virtualization capability. However, given
the DoD CIO"s call that all future conflicts will be coalition
conflicts, this capability must be able to interoperate with other
solutions, regardless if they use these process level virtualization
defenses or not.     Another aspect of the challenge is to make these
capabilities mesh across multiple systems in information flows, some of

Trust in a Shared Cloud",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop the methods, techniques, and
 protocols to establish and maintain mission application trust, and the
resulting mission application security, in a shared cloud
infrastructure.       DESCRIPTION:  The Air Force desires to utilize
cloud computing for mission applications due to its significant cost
reduction and scalability advantages, but needs to maintain the overall
application security to a level equal to standalone systems. Trusted
computing is an important field in cyber security and is an essential
part of any mission-critical operation or secure electronic
communication. Being able to verify the trust among, and the
communications between, critical application services is paramount to
preventing compromise of mission operations. The problem of establishing
 and maintaining trust is magnified in a cloud-based deployment, since
the customer does not physically control the infrastructure, and
applications from multiple customers are likely running simultaneously
on any given infrastructure component. This is even true in a private
cloud infrastructure, although the diversity of customer types may be
less.     The infrastructure of the cloud is controlled and managed by
the cloud provider and not the customer using the cloud's services.
Virtualization is heavily relied upon by the cloud infrastructure and
allows the provider the flexibility to run applications from multiple
customers on the same physical hardware, and transparently move these
applications to other more powerful, or less loaded, physical instances
when performance needs grow.     An appropriately certified cloud
provider will typically state to the customer some level of assurance
that the base infrastructure is secure, but security-conscious customers
 need proof beyond the cloud provider's policy promise. Such a customer
needs to know the base infrastructure is secure, and remains so, while
their critical application runs. These applications need to continuously
 test the trust of the cloud infrastructure they are currently running
on to ensure it has not been compromised, since the application could be
 migrated to a physically different part of the infrastructure at
essentially any time. Also, many of these mission applications are
distributed, and this trust must be communicated between the distributed
 components for the entire mission application to remain secure.     The
 goal of this effort is to provide customers methods to verify the
integrity of their mission applications running on a cloud
infrastructure not in their control, as well as to provide a means to
securely collaborate between distributed application components within
this cloud. Techniques must be provided to periodically maintain and
reestablish the trust of an application component, and for an
application component to determine if it has experienced a loss of
trust. Upon an application component losing trust, this component should
 no longer be able to communicate with its previously trusted
interconnected components. A method to communicate the trustworthiness
between two application components and establish a trusted connection
shall be developed. The end-to-end security established should be able
to survive on a cloud infrastructure that is compromised by an adversary
 with intimate knowledge of the solution provided, and only allow
operation on uncompromised portions. The methods and protocols must be
resilient to an attack even if the entire technique is known.      PHASE
 I:  Identify the typical application components in mission applications
 that are required to establish trust in a shared cloud infrastructure.
Provide techniques to verify and maintain the trust of each individual
application component in the overall system.      PHASE II:  Develop a
method to establish, verify, and maintain trust between the components
outlined in Phase I to allow for trusted communication between
components. Once trust is established between two devices, a trusted
communication method must be demonstrated. A prototype of this system
must demonstrate protection within a cloud infrastructure containing
compromised systems with intimate knowledge of the protocol established.

technologies to automate the process of assuring the trust across a
large cloud infrastructure for a given mission application. This

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a general purpose compute
cloud architecture that allows more granular and flexible allocation of
cloud computing resources for secure cloud-based mission application
development.       DESCRIPTION:  All traditional virtualization
technologies predate the cloud era, and have been designed to be
backward compatible with existing systems at the binary level, thus
making it easy to run any pre-cloud developed applications in the cloud.
 This approach has worked well, since the primary use of the cloud today
 is the outsourcing of traditional enterprise applications by cloud
infrastructure providers that then supply these same applications back
to customers as a service.     However, for new applications designed
specifically for a cloud, these traditional virtualization platforms
bring a lot of extraneous overhead. The traditional VM abstraction is at
 too low a level for a generic compute cloud and as a result requires a
full-blown operating system in each VM instance. When looking at a cloud
 as a general computing resource where a new mission application can be
developed to securely run, this requirement limits the flexibility of
the mission application architecture. Also, it dramatically increases
the cloud resources needed by the mission application in terms of memory
 and computational power, and increases the management requirements of
the overall system.     Most multi-tasking operating systems limit the
effects that one process can have upon other process in the system.
Various system resources are protected and when a process ends (cleanly
or otherwise) the resources held is reclaimed by the system. This
process isolation model has made application development easier and
safer, and has allowed an almost infinite number of applications to be
independently developed for popular operating systems like Linux and
Microsoft Windows. Unfortunately, most operating systems did not go far
enough in preventing malicious applications from breaking process
boundaries.     The Air Force needs a cloud infrastructure that
allocates resources on a per process basis, as opposed to the current
per operating systems basis. This would result in significant savings,
since the operating system need not be duplicated for every virtualized
application instance. Such a system must maintain a level of secure
isolation that is similar to the isolation between operating system
instances in the cloud today.     The goal of this effort is to provide
the Air Force with a more granular cloud architecture which allows new
mission applications the ability to be deployed utilizing drastically
less computing resources, less management burden, and maintain a high
level of security. Techniques must be provided to securely isolate
application components allow them to be easily deployed within the cloud
 infrastructure. This secure isolation must be lightweight, operating
systems agnostic, and impose a minimal computational resource cost as
compared to traditional virtualization, yet provide comparable
protections. Methods and protocols must be provided to allow flexible
secure communications amongst the deployed application components.
PHASE I:  Develop and perform a feasibility study to evaluate whether
any existing AF applications can be scaled\/migrated into a cloud
environment. Document the requirements for applications to
be"cloud-ready"and identify possible candidates. Identify several
candidate applications that provide a reasonable sampling for
development\/testing within a proof-of-concept demonstration capability

technologies for applicability within generalized cloud infrastructure.
Evaluate various secure communication methods\/protocols for
inter-component communications. Design\/implement compute cloud
infrastructure to securely deploy application components. Demonstrate

 usage, while maintaining overall app isolation and security.

protected execution system that assures integrity of systems, software,
and data by preventing unintended or unauthorized leakage through
compromised third-party cloud infrastructures.       DESCRIPTION:
External attackers or malicious insiders can deploy a variety of attacks
 against cloud infrastructure to expose sensitive code and data [1].
These attacks include traditional exploits against cloud instances,
firmware and hardware-based malware, and the injection of malicious
hypervisors.     Three examples of these attacks include:   1. A
modified hypervisor that undetectably hooks and modifies API calls and
arbitrary memory addresses to analyze and alter software behavior.   2.
An attack that modifies a program"s dependencies, such as a
dynamic-linked library (DLL), to modify memory accesses, alter program
behavior, and tamper with data.   3. A custom hypervisor that
single-steps application execution, allowing an adversary to analyze or
modify each instruction as it executes [2].     External adversaries or
malicious insiders at the provider can use these attacks to analyze
code, launch D5 effects, expose sensitive data, and modify software
behavior. With little or no control over the environment, cloud
consumers cannot prevent these attacks.     As military organizations
migrate to the cloud, they may need to trust the integrity of their
systems, software, and data to a third-party, the cloud provider. The
cloud provider may be public (e.g. Amazon EC2, Rackspace, etc.) or
private (e.g. other government organizations). Malicious insiders within
 the provider, or the provider themselves, may analyze, modify, and
exfiltrate a cloud consumer"s code and data [3]. In addition, external
attackers may gain access to the cloud through vulnerabilities and
supply chain attacks. Since the consumer lacks control over the
environment, they cannot prevent these attacks or protect their code and
 data. Cloud consumers would benefit from technology that defeats these
attacks by allowing them to securely operate in untrusted cloud
instances while assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

obfuscation, to prevent the rapid analysis or modification of

out comprehensive benchmarking experiments using representative usage

        "topic_name": "Fault Isolation in Hypervisors with Live
Migration",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To reduce the complexity and attack
surface of commodity hypervisors and the virtual devices used by guest
virtual machines without sacrificing live migration support.
DESCRIPTION:  One of the tenets of Cloud Computing is the ability to
host multiple virtual machine instances (owned by multiple parties) on
the same physical hardware with guarantees that the different machines
will be isolated from each other. These virtual machines can then
migrate from one physical host to another for load balancing and
reliability. By design these virtual machines are managed by a
privileged hypervisor (also known as a Virtual Machine Monitor) that
mediates accesses by the guests to shared physical resources through the
 use of virtual devices and prepares the guest state for live migration.
 Thus a compromise of either the hypervisor or the virtual devices can
lead to a breakdown in the isolation guarantee and live migration
capabilities. This weakness needs to be addressed.     This topic seeks
to buttress the fault isolation guarantees provided by commodity
hypervisors (i.e., Xen, KVM, VMWare, VirtualBox) by reducing the
complexity of the hypervisor and virtual devices, and properly isolating
 the different components, while providing live migration support at the
 same time. Proper isolation implies that an attack on the hypervisor or
 virtual devices can only affect the virtual machine from which the
attack originates. It must not lead to the Denial of Service for the
other guest virtual machines for example. There exists a corpus of
academic research towards privileged hypervisor minimization. These
include DeHype [1], a design that separates the KVM hypervisor into
privileged and unprivileged components and moved all of the unprivileged
 code down to user-space, and NoHype [2] that eliminates much of the
privileged hypervisor among others. The limitation is lack of live
migration support though.     For example, DeHype [1] moves much of the
hypervisor code, including the memory manager, from kernel space down
into the user-space. By doing so, there is a need for two separate Guest
 Physical Address to Host Physical Address mappings: the one held by the
 kernel, and the version that is held by the userspace component. The
userspace component would propose changes to the mappings and the kernel
 verifies the proposed changes, and if valid, commits them into the
Nested Page Tables \/ Extended Page Tables for use by the virtual
machine. In this organization, both copies must be synchronized and must
 be migrated at the same time. This is currently not supported.
PHASE I:  Design a virtualization platform that minimizes the attack

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  This topic seeks to advance the
state of the art towards being able to apply patches to a running guest
virtual machine directly from the hypervisor without specialized
software running on the guest.       DESCRIPTION:  Patch management
plays an important role in ensuring the overall security posture of
machines. Traditionally, enterprise level patch management is conducted
through the use of privileged end-point software that runs on the manage
 system. The patches and configuration changes can then be pushed to the
 end-points from a central server. Patch management in Cloud Computing
essentially follows the same concept where the same end-point software
is installed onto the virtual machines. This same paradigm is used even
for dormant virtual machine images that are not running [1,2]. Given the
 advancement of virtual machine introspection [3] techniques for digital
 forensics and malware analysis [4,5], there is an opportunity to
investigate the ability to apply patches to a live virtual machine with
limited or no guest support. In this manner, critical, user-managed,
misconfigured or malfunctioning virtual machines can still receive
critical patches or configuration updates.      This topic seeks to
advance the state of the art towards being able to apply patches to a
running guest virtual machine directly from the hypervisor without
specialized software running on the guest. The proposed solution needs
to have a sound argument for and evidence to support the notion that the
 patch will be applied and the guest will not be rendered unstable.
Additional metrics, such as the kind or type of patches that can be
applied or the size of a guest module (if necessary), should also be
proposed when necessary.      PHASE I:  Define the type or kind of
patches that can be applied to a live virtual machine and a technique
for patching. Develop and demonstrate live patching on a
proof-of-concept prototype.      PHASE II:  Develop the prototype
designed during Phase I and test it against the proposed metrics.
Demonstrate live patching of virtual machines from the hypervisor using
real-world patches on COTS systems. Prepare for commercialization.
PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Work with the DoD to demonstrate that
the prototype developed during Phase II can also be applied to DoD
systems and software. Further demonstrate the capability through
multiple Guest Operating System platforms, e.g., Windows 7, Ubuntu
Linux, etc.",

antennae for SWaP-constrained aerial platforms. Provide minimal
penetration of platform skin and structure.       DESCRIPTION:  Provide
approach for minimal impact for SWaP-C constrained aerial platforms,
especially small to medium UAS that may be employed as dedicated
maneuvering communications relays and gateways. The frequencies of
interest for the antennas can range from L-band to Ku-band and are
primarily meant to support Line Of Sight (LOS) communications.
Conformal emitters reduce drag and, at times, detectability of the air
platform; in some designs, weight, changes to platform skin and
structure is lessened, but, generally, conformal emitters are more
expensive to install due to the need for underside antenna structures.
Consider placement of one or more improved conformal designs to maximize
 utility of emitter for warfighter use. Consider frequency spectrum
efficiency, cost, ease of manufacture, decrease in effectiveness
(because it is not in the slipstream and may be"hidden"within the
structure) or partially reduced in effectiveness due to potential lack
of backplane provided to traditional emitters by the platform's skin.
   Recent advances by many SBIR and large antenna designers have not had
 a comparative examination. This SBIR would provide an across the board
look at multiple designs, identify specific features, in conjunction
with the IP holders, to compare and contrast design features.
PHASE I:  Examine and compare top 10 emitter designs (from"paint-on"to
flush-mounted but deep) with attention to emitted power, gain, weight,
power usage, skin and structure penetration, detectability by adversary

 Technologies (IMPACT)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Employ geospatial and mission-aware
techniques to provide optimum coverage for all warfighters independent
of mission criticality; reserve ability to prioritize surface
communication needs. Reliable planning of airborne links increases
survivability.       DESCRIPTION:  Dedicated airborne relays and
gateways are a relatively new addition to the battle space, and these
are proving to be valued highly by both US and coalition ground forces.
Having aerial platforms that, merely by virtue of their elevation above
the ground communicator, provide 10 times or more RF effective range to
communications devices used by our ground and special forces
warfighters, allows cross-theater\/cross-battle space communications and
 reachback to main Command &amp; Control (C2) elements. Likewise, an
airborne gateway\/relay can provide extended C2 coverage for strike,
rescue, and resupply missions within or entering\/exiting the battle
space. In order to take full advantage of these airborne
gateway\/relays, a robust mission planning approach is required to
enable detailed planning, dynamic management and adaptive control of the
 enhanced communications and networking capability that is provided by
these assets.      There are so many automated means employed on a
regular basis today for complex networking and mission planning purposes
 that we no longer have to accept only a normalized approach to
communications planning. It is now well within our reach to at least
partially optimize assured RF coverage for all elements of a complex,
changing, mobile set of forces. While it is not possible to establish
a"ground truth"in cognitive networking for something happening in the
future and something subject to continual change, we can vastly improve
the state of communications if we begin to match up link quality and
Quality-of-Service (QoS) for each air and ground element, with
consideration given to the entire battle space, when geospatial, mission
 aware, and temporal factors, in addition to basic RF propagation
factors, are considered. We can also"stretch"our mission planning to
well beyond a safe radius of action for a given pair of
transmitter-receivers, especially as we move to more Internet Protocol
(IP) communications.      We must consider how missions are planned for
joint and coalition forces using common planning tools. In many cases,
specialized mission planning modules exist to control weapons delivery,
navigation, threat avoidance, terrain following, etc. These modules are
based on forward planning techniques which generally employ only a
normalized approach for planning the specific mission. Unlike these
specialized mission planning modules that support unit aircraft through
forward planning techniques, the dedicated communications and network
planning modules which are designed to integrate with current planning
systems, might consider inverse planning techniques to serve a maximum
number of ground users possible within the communications range of one
or more dedicated airborne platforms. Such inverse planning techniques
could employ an automated approach to communications and network
planning through the assignment of critical factors, or weights, to
ground users along with weight optimization schemes for prioritization
of transmitter-receiver pairing. The Commander"s staff not only needs to
 know who the planned communicators are, but who MIGHT BECOME a user on
short notice. Weighting of ground user (or others, non-relay nodes)
mission priorities may need to be considered if the problem set shows a
stretch must be made to fill all potential customer needs.      It will
be vital to determine which factors can be normalized (considered at a
base level, without specific outlier conditions considered). Radio
characteristics may include: frequency, waveform, power, power
amplifiers, antenna patterns, co-site issues, mode, etc. Antenna
characteristics may include: multiple input\/output (MIMO) versus single
 input\/output (SISO), co-site factors, frequency, gain (transmit and
receive), directionality, diplexing, etc. Some physical factors to be
considered are: partial\/full antenna blockage by wing\/fuselage,
aircraft state (both receiver and transmitter), terrain, and
environment\/weather. Propagation factors such as frequency sharing or
isolation, and shared spectrum beyond effective ranges may also be
considered in the solution.      PHASE I:  Outline\/select, in
conjunction with SPOC\/TPOC, factors for the planning problem. Deliver
prototype IMPACT module, based on current unit-level mission planning
tool for the communications node. Identify services needed from air,
land, maritime forces'planning centers to determine the"customer set"and
 priorities.      PHASE II:  Refine and test using modeling and
simulation and RF emulation tools. In conjunction with unit-level
mission planning office, select test cases; working with relevant
airborne gateway\/relay programs, validate problem set, run test cases.
With SPOC\/TPOC, select appropriate venue for live testing using
existing field assets in live- virtual-constructive (LVC) environment.

Mission Planning Division) to integrate IMPACT into Unit-Level Mission
Planning and Force-Level Mission and Campaign Planning at Air Operations

authentication mechanisms and services required to enable Air Force
Weather (AFW) data and tailored products to be available to authorized
and authenticated users on Android- OS (and potentially iOS) platforms.
      DESCRIPTION:  Bluetooth common access card (CAC) readers for
Android (and others) smartphones and tablets are commercially available,
 and some configurations have already been analyzed by the Defense
Information Systems Agency (DISA)
(http:\/\/iase.disa.mil\/stigs\/net_perimeter\/wireless\/smartphone.html).
 However, it needs to be determined if all the required technology and
approvals exist and only the Air Force Weather apps need to be written,
or if there is a technology gap that must be solved first. And in the
case of a technology gap, potential solution sets need to be identified
and evaluated.     In this SBIR, we will investigate the current and
near-term state of technology for military mobile applications to
determine what is possible for supporting mobile application integration
 for Air Force Weather data and services. Specifically, the challenges
of Android (and possibly other) mobile applications with Information
Assurance (IA) requirements over mobile devices will be addressed for
AFW web pages and services. Android applications and mobile devices have
 many challenges within DoD Information Assurance IT systems. Generally,
 a DoD IT system must apply for IA certification &amp; accreditation (C
&amp; A) that have stringent guidance programs that must be addressed in
 order to receive an authority to operate (ATO) with a DoD Designated
Approving Authority (DAA). This SBIR will investigate Cyber Security and
 IA best practices and determine how they are to be incorporated into
the AFW application development process. When there is no solution
resulting in a technology gap that must be addressed, potential
solutions will be identified and evaluated.     For example, Android
implements an application permission framework that provides the ability
 to control which operations are allowed for individual applications.
This SBIR will determine the use of application permissions (e.g.,
obtain\/grant access to capabilities of the Android device) and the
rationale for defining new permissions for controlling inter-application
 access.     Using the DISA Android STIG and the Application Security
and Development STIG as guidance for application authentication and
access control, this SBIR will determine the approach for AFW Android
mobile apps (e.g., multi-tier versus in-device) and identify the
potential authentication points. Both the need for a DoD Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI)-approved credentials and a CAC reader and password
authentication will be addressed, as well as software security
certificates, as an alternative to physical CAC authentication.     In
addition, the SBIR will recommend solutions or identify technology gaps
and potential solution sets for:    a. Use of standard Notice and
Consent Banners   b. Data protection      - Encryption for
data\/databases on the Android device         - Encryption and integrity
 protection for data stored on and external SD card and\/or alternatives
 to using an external SD card   c. Reverse engineering protection (e.g.,

Prioritization (C2DTP) to Enable Mission-Responsive Crypto-Partitioned
Networks",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Provide commander the ability to
reprioritize traffic dynamically within a crypto-partitioned network to
maximize mission responsiveness to changing battlefield needs. C2DTP
provides commander graphical geospatial control over communications
nodes.       DESCRIPTION:  Network traffic prioritization is
traditionally controlled by creating policies on a network's routers.
This process is difficult, requiring highly-skilled information
technology and security specialists, and, even with expert construction,
 the policies are often error-prone and subject to revision to invoke
new or modified policies as battle space conditions and higher
headquarters decisions change. Moreover, networks with cipher-text (CT)
cores significantly complicate matters as black-side routers cannot
distinguish encapsulated packets based on their original contents.
The Air Force seeks a quality of service (QoS) solution that is capable
of disseminating prioritization policies, which are based on commander"s
 mission needs, over a CT core.  The goal is to enable a network command
 authority to choose network traffic prioritization policies"on the
fly"instead of being saddled with one-size-fits-all configurations for
an entire mission.     If the network"s routing core were not
crypto-partitioned (CT core), command-defined traffic prioritization
could be realized with existing network QoS mechanisms (e.g., IntServ,
DiffServ, SWAN) or through minor enhancements of these existing QoS
mechanisms.  However, the need to determine the priority of both ends of
 the flow, adjust to the highest priority, and then convey this
information from the plain text (PT) side endpoints to the CT core
routers along the path, is a major technology gap that needs to be
closed.     The proposed solution should preserve the strict separation
rules of crypto-partitioned tactical networks, i.e., no information from
 the original packet is conveyed in plaintext across the CT core. It
should operate in the traditional policy-based QoS mode, as it does
today, until override is requested by the commander's communications
team. Furthermore, the solution should not introduce additional
out-of-order delivery of application-layer packets. The solution should
support different classes of traffic (e.g., fire control, voice, video
stream, Web, e-mail) and dynamic prioritization within the traffic
classes.      Commercial Potential: Internet service providers could use
 such an approach to offer data prioritization to their customers who
employ virtual private networking over the Internet.      PHASE I:
Develop concept through analysis and simulation. Provide means to
represent communications nodes graphically and geospatially, allowing
communications leads (JICO, A3, A6, Cyber Control) means to rapid
reconfigure routing schemes without manual commands to routers. Provide
means to prevent introduction of errors and misrouting through positive
control of operator authority and set conditions.      PHASE II:
Construct prototype system of C2DTP with means to demonstrate manual
routing control and a simple geospatial routing control with innovative
user interface (use [NASA] WorldWind, NGA [DoD] GoogleEarth, AGI STK,
AgileClient, or similar geospatial GUI in use by USAF). Demonstrate how
RF propagation and performance parameters (e.g., distance, ERP, BER,
etc.) and compatibility of routed RF nodes are accommodated.      PHASE

efforts. Commercial Potential: Internet service providers could use such
 an approach to offer data prioritization to their customers who employ

Information Discovery",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Research &amp; develop an advanced
indexing and search capability that combines Information Extraction and
Information Retrieval methods to enable rapid identification &amp;
discovery of relevant information in large (web scale) volumes of
textual data.       DESCRIPTION:  Finding and extracting new knowledge
from large volumes of textual data remains one of the most significant
challenges to intelligence analysts. This problem spans across multiple
intelligence domains (ex. Behavioral Influence, Command and Control),
requiring systems to be adaptable in both a multi-domain and dynamic
world environment. As the volume of data continues to grow beyond the
capacity of intelligence analysts to cull through it, the need to
identify relevant information in a timely manner further compounds the
problem.  Analysts need capabilities that support efficient
identification and discovery of relevant information in web- scale
document collections within a time-limited window of analysis.
Current tools for Information Retrieval (IR) are too general and current
 tools for Information Extraction (IE) are too specific to effectively
meet the needs of intelligence analysts working in a continually
changing environment. IR systems allow the analyst to cast a wide net
when searching for information, do not require apriori knowledge of what
 the analyst will be looking for, and support serendipitous discovery of
 relevant information the analyst may not have known to look for.
However, they fail to identify information in a narrower context and do
not identify entities, events, and relations. IE systems, on the other
hand, automatically identify entities, events, and relations and provide
 structured information from unstructured text. However, these systems
must be customized apriori to the domains of interests, and the analyst
is only able to find information that the system extracted.     The goal
 of this topic is to research and develop an advanced indexing and
search capability that combines Information Retrieval (IR) and
Information Extraction (IE) methods to: (1) dynamically model user
information needs, including building models for retrieving entities,
events, and relations; (2) rapidly search large (web scale) volumes of
textual data to identify relevant information; (3) return relevant
information with precision and recall which exceeds the current
state-of-the-art; and (4) enable users to refine or change their
information needs over time through interacting with the system. By
combining IR and IE methods, and increasing user interaction with the
system to model, persist, and refine their information needs, analysts
will be better enabled to find a more complete set of relevant
information from large volumes of textual data in a time- limited window
 of analysis than they would using IR or IE individually.      PHASE I:
 The goal of Phase I is to investigate advanced indexing and search
capabilities that combine IE and IR methods to enable rapid
identification and discovery of relevant information in large (web
scale) volumes of textual documents. The investigation should produce a
prototype design that considers multiple domains and entity, event, and
relation types.      PHASE II:  The goal of Phase II is to implement the
 Phase I design into a prototype system that can be demonstrated across
multiple domains and entity, event and relation types. This phase would
also include functional and performance testing of the prototype, and
demonstration that the prototype meets the goals of this topic.
PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: An advanced indexing and search
application that combines IE and IR methods would benefit military

Latent Relationship Discovery",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Provide improved real-time
situational awareness through discovery of unknown relationships across
multiple structured and unstructured textual data sources.
DESCRIPTION:  The number of textual data sources, formats, and types
available to information analysts has exploded in recent years. Often,
the relevant data about an entity or event of interest is scattered
across multiple data sources and is incomplete within a single data
source. There is a need to discover previously unknown relationships
pertaining to entities and events of interest across these multiple data
 sources in order to help analysts find more complete information about
those entities and events. Such a capability would support tasks such as
 maintaining situational awareness, patterns of life analysis, and
providing real time alert notifications to the analyst from multiple
text-based intelligence data sources.     Current approaches to
relationship extraction suffer from limitations of using contextual and
syntactical cues, which are not scalable and have limited statistical
reliability in identifying previously unknown relationships. By
leveraging new developments in statistical relational learning, novel
relationship discovery algorithms are emerging. The challenge in an
operational environment is to provide situational awareness to the
analyst in real time. This requires the development of incremental
learning models that reduce the time complexity currently required.
Basic algorithm work is needed to not only leverage the advances in
statistical relational learning for relationship discovery, but to do so
 in an operational setting enabling online updates of models across
multiple unstructured and structured data sources. This analytic
operation would significantly increase the accuracy of reports or
intelligence summaries that could be used to provide real-time alert
notifications to the user.     The goal of this topic is to research and
 develop algorithms for discovering previously unknown relationships,
pertaining to entities and events of interest, across multiple
unstructured semi-structured and structured text-based intelligence data
 sources, mIRC, and various databases. The algorithms should be scalable
 and capable of operating in real time, in order to support both
forensic and real-time use cases. Such a capability would enable
intelligence analysts to efficiently leverage more sources of data for
their tasks and enhance their situational awareness by providing more
complete information than can be found in each data source alone or by
manually identifying relationships across sources in a time-limited
window of analysis.      Military Application: The higher order fusion
of information is fundamental building capability to enhancing the
output from today"s intelligence analysts.  The techniques and
algorithms developed can be applied to information centric systems to
simplify the discovery of not just information but to detect broader
relationships than possible today.  Relationships can be identified
based on holistic analysis of all available data to enable support of
warfighters in an operational setting where improved situational
awareness is crucial.  The results of this research would also be useful
 to Department of Homeland Security's many databases, like that used to
check passengers on various forms of traffic (such as airplanes, trains
and ships).      Commercial Application: The development and products
from this research endeavor can be applied to information centric
systems that require the discovery of relations that can lead to unknown
 intelligence or knowledge. Examples of systems that would benefit would
 be FBI database scheme, and state and local police databases.  The
ability to discover relations in data would also be beneficial to
banking and state motor vehicle agencies.      PHASE I:  The goal of
Phase I is to investigate scalable algorithms for discovering unknown
relationships, pertaining to entities and events of interest, across
multiple unstructured and structured textual data sources in real time.
 The investigation should produce a prototype design for relationship
discovery across these sources. Developed capabilities will be
demonstrated by use of open source data.        PHASE II:  The goal of
Phase II is to implement the Phase I design into a prototype system that
 can be demonstrated across multiple unstructured and structured textual
 data sources, in forensic and real-time scenarios.  Unclassified and
classified data will be provided for evaluation of developed research.
The prototype system should be SOA-compliant to facilitate integration
with other systems.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: A capability
for discovering unknown relationships across multiple data sources would
 benefit military intelligence analysts. It would also benefit
customers, such as FBI, state\/local police, and Department of Homeland
Security, who leverage data found in multiple databases and unstructured
 sources.",

        "topic_name": "Early Design Analysis for Robust Cyberphysical
Systems Engineering",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop an innovative automated
design\/analysis framework establishing consistent use of MARTE with
UML, SysML and other design notations to enable robust engineering
through early performance analysis in development of distributed,
real-time systems.       DESCRIPTION:  Real Time Embedded Systems (RTES)
 are critical components of cyberphysical systems. Model Driven
Engineering (MDE) is an approach to software development based on models
 and transformations among them that is emerging as a viable approach
for RTES software and systems development. Models may be specified in
OMG"s Unified Modeling Language (UML), Systems Modeling Language
(SysML), or other languages. However, languages like UML are too broadly
 defined to be used in performance analysis of cyberphysical systems. To
 address this concern, OMG creates profiles to restrict and define the
modeling language to certain domains.      Modeling and Analysis of Real
 Time Embedded Systems (MARTE) is a profile associated with UML and
SysML and supported by OMG. MARTE allows for both a design and an
analysis model of RTES. The design model has a High Level Application
Model (HLAM) package to explicitly represent the communication,
coordination, and computation of RTES; a Generic Component Model (GCM)
to represent components used in an RTES, and other packages. Designers
are motivated to use these packages to explicitly represent behavior and
 to generate code to the maximum extent possible. MARTE is also key to
performance assessment of UML\/SysML designs for early design analysis.
Reports demonstrate performance assessment with the Performance Analysis
 Model (PAM), and schedulability assessment with the Schedulability
Analysis Model (SAM) [Espinoza 2007 and others].     While integrated
design and analysis has been demonstrated to be viable, there are
remaining difficulties in automating those assessments. Automation of
performance assessment is possible in a restricted domain [Moreno and
Smith 2009], but automating the assessment for any design in any domain
faces significant challenges. One of the key challenges is in the
integration of models commonly used for system production or software
code generation with the information that is relevant to perform
analysis. Integration is essential for accuracy and consistency of the
models [Espinoza et.al. 2009]. Creating performance specifications with
PAM requires considerable expertise in performance analysis which limits
 the ability to automate the performance analysis for designers.
Espinoza et.al. report another challenge is that there are multiple ways
 to express the same design feature in MARTE and SysML and there is"not a
 predetermined approach to use the (MARTE with SysML) language
constructs through the development life cycle."Not only are there
multiple notations that may be used, there are multiple ways
of"overlaying"MARTE specifications on the design model. They may be on
multiple diagrams such as sequence diagrams, activity diagrams,
deployment diagrams, etc.; they may be spread through several diagrams;
and there may be multiple stereotypes on a single element. There are
also tool differences in how these specifications are represented in an
XML (Extensible Markup Language) Metadata Interchange (XMI) file.
One such approach is to create a domain-specific modeling language that
uses a merged meta-model of only the features needed, along with
possible extensions to represent missing features for that domain
[Quadri 2010]. This is a powerful technique, however optimally suited
for a restricted domain that lends itself to automation and is useful
for proof of concept demonstrations. It is undesirable, however, to have
 many such languages that each require special industrial-strength tool
support, and integrating various parts of the design in different
languages to represent all aspects of a large-scale system is especially
 problematic [Espinoza et.al. 2009].      PHASE I:  Define and architect
 an automated design and analysis framework establishing consistent use
of MARTE with UML, SysML, and other design notations and enabling robust
 systems engineering through early performance analysis. Appropriate
analysis techniques need to be selected and the conceptual approach and
design of how to integrate the technologies be completed.      PHASE II:
  Develop, implement, demonstrate and validate the concepts and design
created during Phase I. Tools and interface approaches would need to be
selected, integrated and\/or developed. Demonstration of the solution's
openness, scalability, and degree of automation in the exchange of
design data should be performed, as well as accomplishing performance or
 real-time analysis against a representative DoD design.      PHASE III
DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Military application: This work would be
applicable to any DoD system that has distributed and\/or real-time
characteristics. Commercial application: The telecom, automobile, and
manufacturing and control industries in general experience the same
issues and would find this technology useful.",

        "topic_name": "Living Plan",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Keep military plans alive by
developing innovative ways of dynamically maintaining efficacy of
military plans at the strategic, operational, and battle planning
levels, as things change (i.e., keep plans current; keep plans
executable).       DESCRIPTION:  We are looking for revolutionary ideas
on how to enable the conduct of well-coordinated, synchronized military
operations among all available military forces to achieve unities of
effort. At the heart of such integrated Command and Control (C2)
capabilities is the ability to plan and task assets across federated
war-fighting domains (horizontally and vertically). The complexity of
such integration, need for high-speed decisions, and the exceptionally
rapid change in world state drives the need for highly adaptable,
constantly updating plans (i.e., living plans). Hence, this topic is
asking for ways and means of sustaining plans at any and\/or all levels
of command.     The Adaptive Planning Roadmap II, signed by the
Secretary of Defense on March 5, 2008, defines a living plan as,"A plan
that is maintained continuously within a collaborative environment to
reflect changes in guidance or the strategic environment. Automatic
triggers linked to authoritative [data] sources, assumptions, and key
capabilities will alert leaders and planners to changes in critical
conditions that warrant a reevaluation of a plan"s continuing relevancy,
 feasibility, sufficiency, and risk.  Living plans provide a solid
foundation for transition to crisis action planning. Hence, contingency
plans are no longer maintained on a cyclical basis but rather in
a"living"state (i.e., being refined and adapted as required) until
terminated or handed over to crisis action planners for execution."Two
critical enablers of the"living"plan concept are dynamic apportionment
and the ability of the Joint force provider to assess the availability
and readiness of a plan"s required assets. The living plan concept also
extends down to battle planning and even battle management.     C2
planning systems at all echelons, therefore, must be able to reason over
 dynamic environments and to continuously update plans by synergizing
the strengths, dependencies and relationships among the Joint forces
brought to bear.     Some of the anticipated capabilities needed to
enable the living plan concept are to continuously:   1) Represent and
work with complex, nested structures like entities, capabilities,
goals\/objectives\/intent, activities, sub-plans, processes, and plan
branches.     2) Manage a changing set of partial plans, each composed
of connected tasks (the further out, the more abstract) with their own
timelines (hours to years).     3) Update based on near-real-time
identification of changes to key planning assumptions and factors, while
 minimizing perturbations to other on-going mission threads and keeping
federated activities synchronized.     4) Defer resource commitments as
late as possible to achieve optimal operational execution.     5)
Share\/merge federated plans and operational pictures (i.e., world
state) across the Global Information Grid via federated Service Oriented
 operations.     6) Task (re-task) on the fly.     Very simplistic,
concrete examples:   - A contingency plan (e.g., OPLAN Aa) is being
sustained to enable military forces to quickly react to a crisis in a
given region of the world. OPLAN Bb covers a different region. Both have
 Unit XY standing ready to deploy. OPLAN Bb is executed and hence Unit
XY is tasked. The C2 system automatically triggers an alert that OPLAN
Aa needs a different unit assigned to fill in for Unit XY (i.e., keep
plans on the virtual shelf from getting stale\/unexecutable).     - A
battle plan is being executed and a strike fighter is shot down. The C2
system automatically triggers alerts and highlights what
objectives\/effects are at risk of not being achieved and what options
are available to fix the problem.      PHASE I:  Conduct research, glean
 knowledge from subject matter experts, develop relevant military use
cases to validate concepts, and design revolutionary ways of keeping
plans current.      PHASE II:  Develop, demonstrate, and validate a
prototype in a relevant scenario clearly demonstrating ability to meet
the desired capabilities and defined metrics within a service oriented
environment.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The novel
capabilities developed will be useful in all C2 applications that
involve the planning of events whether they are military (e.g., attack,
air refueling, surveillance) or commercial (e.g., homeland security,
sporting events, transportation, and agriculture).",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop innovative methods for
ensuring privacy and operations security (OPSEC) for individual users
across an enterprise while searching, browsing or chatting on the Web.
     DESCRIPTION:  Consider the following scenario: An important meeting
 is held at an Air Force organization. Immediately afterward there is a
spike in web searches coming from that organization. Identification of
the topic and impact of that meeting will be a trivial thing for a
search provider. Spikes in web traffic are regularly evaluated by search
 providers to identify trends or to give users more"personalized"search
results. What else this data is (or could be) used for is left up to the
 imagination. In addition to search provider concerns, data aggregators
also exist who work with many partners to discern a user"s Internet
activity.     In recent years the traditional threats to our industrial
and military security have largely been replaced with the ubiquitous
threats that come through the Internet. Physical and communications
security is still important but the Web is an open channel for
monitoring our organization"s interest and activities. This is also a
threat that we do not know how to close or even minimize for
rank-and-file members of large enterprises.     In the Department of
Defense, the need for privacy is embodied in our OPSEC program. The
purpose of OPSEC is to identify critical information and analyze our
actions with the intent to deny adversaries any indications of our
operations and activities. In private industry, a similar concern is
that of industrial espionage. Back as far as 1998, there was an estimate
 of $300 billion a year in potential loss to corporate America from
theft of intellectual property.     Current methods available to
anonymize our Internet traffic fall far short of that which would be
required to truly protect us. The Tor routing service provides a big
step in this direction but, for enterprise use, there are issues with
speed, scalability and concerns about loss of anonymity at entry and
exit nodes. Tor also does not address machine fingerprinting, browser
history analysis, cookies and auto fill data hijacking. Proxy servers
can change the IP address of the specific user but the proxy rarely will
 cover the identity of the organization that this person belongs to.
Even when networking parameters are completely obfuscated, the traffic
is still subject to fingerprinting techniques that can identify a
specific machine or user.     This effort will develop architectures for
 privacy and OPSEC that will anonymize Internet search and browsing such
 that actions cannot be attributed to either an individual or
organization. The solution shall be scalable across entire enterprises
consisting of 1,000 or more client machines. It shall disrupt machine
fingerprinting methods, all types of cookies, browser history analysis,
form auto fill data hijacking, online behavior fingerprinting and
network layer identity clues. The architecture can include a combination
 of currently available tools and appliances and\/or new software,
routing protocols or policy. The solution shall not rely on an outside
entity to scrub our traffic since this would reveal our raw traffic to
that entity. A demonstration of the technology shall be done such that
the feasibility of this architecture for enterprise privacy\/OPSEC can
be verified.      PHASE I:  1) Design notional architecture(s) for
privacy and OPSEC during Internet search, browsing and chat that is
scalable across a large enterprise. 2) Define alternate methods or
components where diversity may provide a more robust solution. 3)
Proof-of-feasibility demonstration of key enabling concepts.      PHASE
II:  1) Develop and demonstrate a prototype that implements the Phase I
methodology, 2) identify appropriate performance metrics for evaluation,
 and 3) detail the plan for the Phase III effort.      PHASE III DUAL
USE APPLICATIONS: MILITARY USE: OPSEC for DoD and other government
enterprises during Internet search and browsing requires innovative
methods and a robust, scalable solution. COMMERCIAL USE: Successful

Airborne Platforms and Battlefield Air Force Personnel",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop an electrical conductor that
 is lighter and has two- to three-times higher electrical conductivity
per weight than comparably rated copper (Cu) or aluminum (Al) wires.
   DESCRIPTION:  Electric wires and cables constitute by far the largest
 weight portion of aircraft electrical power systems, as well as a large
 fraction of an entire aircraft weight. Replacing Cu or Al wires with
conductors that are substantially lighter would improve the fuel economy
 of an aircraft while also increasing the amount of useful load it could
 carry. In addition, the Battlefield Air Operations Kit (BAO) program
has two documented requirements (both of them Key System Attributes) to
reduce the weight and volume of electrical power management, which
includes cables, in order to reduce personnel fatigue and snag hazards
during special operations missions.       Due to reliance on traditional
 copper-wire cables, reducing the weight of electrical wiring systems
has been elusive. However, recent development of conductors operating at
 ambient room temperature (72degreesF) or extreme battlefield conditions
 of -30 to 125degreesF, have shown promise to be much lighter than Cu or
 Al. For instance, iodine-doped carbon nanotubes (CNT) have been made
into long length fiber strands that have about 300 and 50 percent higher
 electrical conductivity per weight than Cu and Al, respectively [3].
Composite multilayer structures of graphene + FeCl3 made by
intercalation were observed to have about two-times higher electrical

        "topic_name": "Modeling the Impact of Silica Particle Ingestion
on Turbomachinery Life",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a decision support tool to
determine the impact of silica particle ingestion on component service
life of the engine hot section.       DESCRIPTION:  Operational
requirements of commercial and military aircraft often render the
traditional method of total avoidance of silica-rich particle
contaminate ingestion infeasible. The 2010 Iceland volcanic ash cloud
was of such a large extent that military sorties had to be rerouted
around the outer perimeters of the cloud. Many airports around the world
 are subject to long-term exposure to sand-laden air. Also, volcanic
clouds containing silica can be encountered in-flight before detection,
resulting in inadvertent engine exposure. The current total avoidance
strategy is driven by lack of detailed knowledge of how the two common
particle types, fine sand and volcanic ash, affect engine components
through several mechanisms of damage. These include erosive wear from
mechanical action, impact damage from hard particles, contamination of
accessories systems, and accumulation from melting and subsequent
deposition within the hotter gas turbine engine components. Catastrophic
 failure of turbomachinery from high levels (approximately 0.1 gm dust
per cubic meter of air) of calcium-magnesium-aluminum-silicon oxide
(CMAS) particulates has been documented, but the effect of shortened
component life imposed by reduced particulate loads that allow continued
 engine operation (approximately 1 g to 1 mg per cubic meter), is not
well understood. Glass accumulation on the combustor and turbine
components may be an event that does not mandate replacement if thermal
cycling allows thermal spallation of the glass accumulated; however,
this may compromise component life. Compounding the problem is the
widespread use of thermal barrier coatings in the turbine and combustor
sections of advanced engines, where CMAS-induced coating loss can
increase the risk of thermal fatigue in the base materials. Since sand
and volcanic ash composition vary widely with geographic location, a
tailorable CMAS particulate may be worth deriving for experimental
approaches. The various minor chemical components in the CMAS can alter
the phase change temperature of the silica, as well as serve as fluxing
agents. It will be necessary to determine the depositional locations as
well as the combined effects of some of the anticipated component
life-reduction mechanisms, including degradation of the thermal barrier
coating (TBC) layers, blade harmonic loading, and cooling boundary
layers. This topic seeks a novel method of accounting for the cumulative
 exposure effects of silica-particulate containments upon turbomachinery
 components in regards to time change interval reduction from the
phase-change deposition of the particulates. An expert-system and\/or
decision support tool that allows for reduction of operable time for
various stages based on particulate size, concentration, and exposure
time is a desired deliverable product. Phase I shall focus on the
experimental design concept and numerical modeling tools that will use
the experimental results to build a service life estimation tool that
will downgrade the remaining service life based on CMAS accumulation,
cooling disruption, thermal barrier erosion and other compromised
conditions. Phase II will involve testing components that have had CMAS
accumulated on them, validating the numerical extrapolation model
against them to generalize the change in loading as a function of CMAS
time and concentration exposure. Based on the outcomes of this test
effort, a validated fatigue-failure numerical model will be used to
determine remaining service life as a function of CMAS exposure levels.
     PHASE I:  Demonstrate the feasibility of simulating glass
accumulation effects on components at various conditions within gas
turbines. Demonstrate CMAS formulations for representative sand and
volcanic ash systems. Show a modeling concept that can be validated
against test conditions and allows a generalized component time change
modification model to be generated. Develop a test plan for this
purpose.      PHASE II:  Demonstrate testing for glass accumulation
effects of CMAS particulates at various engine operating conditions
(temperature, species, velocity, concentration, and size parameters).
Validate the modeling concept against test data from demonstration cases
 in collaboration with government and industry end users. Deliver a
decision support tool that adjusts time change interval of components
based on silica particulate exposure history and engine conditions, and
an instruction manual for tool use.      PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: Adoption of the tool by aircraft maintenance organizations
 will support dispositions for exposed engines. Commercial benefits
include improved opportunities for providers of air services to refine
risk when operating in environments with pervasive silica-particulate
contamination.",

        "topic_name": "Additive Metal Manufacturing (AMM) Process
Development for Gas Turbine Engine Component Repair",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and validate an
additive-metal manufacturing repair process for complex engine
components in aging Air Force (AF) fleets.        DESCRIPTION:  Gas
turbine engine components experience damages such as fatigue, foreign
object damage (FOD), erosion, and fretting wear that make the
sustainment of fleets burdensome. Damaged components in most AF fleets
are usually replaced with new parts supported by the original equipment
manufacturer (OEM); however, the AF still owns and operates a number of
aging engines no longer supported by OEMs. Though some of the
unsupported components were manufactured from known, commercially
available materials, some were made from either proprietary or
unavailable material compositions with sometimes unknown manufacturing
processes and parameters. In order to sustain aging fleets and
unsupported components, an additive metal manufacturing (AMM) and
re-engineering effort for part repair and remanufacturing is being
explored. The primary manufacturing procedure for this effort is direct
metal laser sintering (DMLS). This procedure requires both test
validation and equipment enhancement to qualify the AMM repair and
remanufacturing capability for flight components.       Validating the
remanufacturing or repair of unsupported engine parts requires adherence
 to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) part manufacturing
approval (PMA) process. The FAA states that two basic ways that a PMA
applicant can show that a part meets airworthiness standards are as
follows: first, establish identicality between the remanufactured or
repaired and certified parts, and second, show through tests and
computations that the remanufactured or repaired part meets
airworthiness requirements. In the case of identicality, it must be
shown that the remanufactured or repaired part is identical in material
composition and functionality to the original part via mechanical
material property performance. As for test and computation, the
remanufactured or repaired part must show similarities in airworthiness
functionality to the original part, only; meaning, the identicality of
the functionality and the material composition is not of great
importance.       The innovative research required to attain
airworthiness and to meet the standard for AMM repair is as follows: for
 Phase I, develop a DMLS repair process for blended\/cutout aluminum and
 titanium coupon specimens and validate functionality by comparing
failure results of repaired and baseline (pristine) coupon specimens;
for Phase II, validate the DMLS repair process for an aluminum alloy
with the same functionality as the TF33 fuel pump housing and conduct
the repair on the part. Material property data for TF33 will be provided
 by the AF. Phase II may also require an enhancement to the equipment
used for DMLS repair, specifically software control and powder
application, so that repairs can be made on components with geometries
that are more complex than that of coupon specimens. A final
presentation of the repair capability demonstrated in the Phase II
activity is required at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.       To
successfully perform the work described in this topic area, offerors may
 request to utilize unique facilities\/equipment in the possession of
the U.S. Government located onsite at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
Accordingly, the following items of Base Support may be provided to the
successful offeror, subject to availability and negotiations, in
accordance with the clause in Air Force Materiel Command FAR Supplement
(AFMCFARS) 5352.245-9004"Base Support."The facilities\/equipment include
 the Turbine Engine Fatigue Facility (TEFF) and certain fracture,
fatigue, and vibration testing and measurement systems therein.
PHASE I:  Validate high and low strain rate material strengths [1,2],
fatigue crack growth [3], low cycle and high cycle fatigue rates [4,5]
of DMLS-repaired aluminum and titanium coupon specimens via comparative
experimental study against respective baseline specimens. Demonstrate
repair capability on coupon specimens by showing functionality within 20
 percent when compared to baseline results.      PHASE II:  Determine
material properties of the TF33 fuel pump housing and gear wipe (AFRL),
conduct Phase I activities on housing and gear wipe materials, and
conduct successful repair of housing and gear wipe. Deliverables: a FAA
PMA validated repair capability for TF33 housing and gear wipe.

sustainment costs, including part purchasing, and the design and
fabrication of obsolete parts. Commercial: AMM repair is adopted by OEMs

satisfaction, and the latter to reduce part replacement costs.",

Aircraft Structural Integrity",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop fuse-like SHM techniques for
 the ASIP environment. Methods must be reliable, low cost, and durable.
Methods must reduce maintenance burden, while maintaining safety.
DESCRIPTION:  The U.S. Air Force utilizes a damage-tolerant design
approach to ensure the structural safety and reliability of the
airframes on its fleet. A critical facet of this damage-tolerant design
approach is nondestructive inspection (NDI). These inspections ensure
that a critical crack is not present in the inspected region and that
any defects present are so sufficiently small that they will not grow to
 failure during the next service interval. While this approach is
effective, the maintenance burden associated with repeated inspections
can be problematic. The inspections themselves can be difficult and
significant disassembly of the structure may be required to gain access
to the inspection areas. Since there are typically many inspection
points on an aircraft, this can result in significant cost and downtime
for the aircraft.      Unconventional approaches to supplement these
aircraft structural inspections in an ASIP environment are desired. This
 effort will focus on developing a fuse-like system that will be
implemented in the area where cracking is anticipated to occur on a
metallic structure. These mechanical fuses may be bonded or utilize a
direct-write methodology in which the sensor traces are directly
deposited in the surface of the structure. Once the crack initiates and
starts to propagate through the region where the sensors have been
attached, the sensor traces will break, thus giving the indication of
damage. The developed fuse system should be able to detect cracking of
0.1 inch or better. Remote determination functionality must permit
indications of initiation and size of damage, either through a
strategically located data port or wirelessly transmitted to a hand-held
 device. The developed sensor technology must be suitable for robust
operation in the austere flight\/field environments with limited
maintenance and low false call rates as well as high detection
capability.     In Phase I, demonstrate the developed fuse-type SHM
approaches for aircraft structural integrity to provide a
proof-of-concept model or prototype that is scalable to a full-size
aerospace structure. Crack initiation and sizing will be demonstrated on
 a simple metallic, laboratory dogbone specimen. Demonstrate that the

ability to perform sensor health checks to differentiate between a
damaged sensor or a damaged structure. Outline a viable validation path
to ensure compliance with MIL-HDBK-1530C (ASIP) or a logical evolution
thereof.     In Phase II, develop and conclusively demonstrate a
prototype application of the developed approaches and validate the
reliability of such a device in a relevant environment. It is
recommended to partner with a potential end user of the technology to
maximize the relevance of the demonstration and facilitate subsequent
transition\/commercialization. The demonstration of the developed system
 should show that the system is applicable to a more realistic aircraft
structure with significantly more complicated geometry. Demonstrate that
 the developed technique can achieve a high probability of detection
rate and low probability of false alarms. Examine the possibility of
moving from accessing the data via a strategically located data port to
the use of a hand-held device where the data could be wirelessly
transmitted.       PHASE I:  Demonstrate fuse-type SHM methods for
aircraft structure to prove scalability. Crack detection and sizing will
 be demonstrated on metallic laboratory specimens. Demonstrate that the
approach causes no negative impacts. Sensors must differentiate between
damaged sensors and damaged structure. Outline a viable path to ensure
compliance with MIL-HDBK-1530C.      PHASE II:  Develop and demonstrate a

predicting life and scheduling inspections",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Obtain a more accurate prediction of
 remaining life and inspection interval for an individual aircraft by
converting actual aircraft usage data into stresses on the structure via
 physics-based, real-time aeroservoelastic simulations.
DESCRIPTION:  The process of determining initial or remaining aircraft
structure life has not significantly changed in 50 years.  It is still a
 highly manual and labor intensive process, individual steps are not
easily integrated together, and the advantages of high performance
computing have not been fully utilized. Recently, the Air Force Research
 Laboratory has produced a long-term vision, called Airframe Digital
Twin (Ref 1), that is beginning to address these issues. This project
will be one of the crucial early steps toward the Airframe Digital Twin
vision.      Several U.S. military aircraft (e.g., F-16, F-15, C-5, and
A-10) are reaching or are already beyond their originally designed,
fatigue lives. To identify their residual fatigue life or extend their
fatigue life by retrofit, accurate loads spectra to perform fatigue
analyses or ground fatigue tests on these aircraft is required.
Physics-based models of crack formation and growth are also required,
since empirical models based on a large database of historical crack
formation and growth are helpful in detecting cracks, but lack
understanding of, and insight to, the physics of how cracks are formed.
    Aircraft life prediction and inspection intervals have traditionally
 been generated using empirical models applied to a single, standard
aircraft usage profile for the entire fleet. These models are expensive
to generate and update. The transition from event-based to real-time
flight data recorders on individual fleet members provides Aircraft
Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) managers with powerful new
information to transition to individual life predictions and inspection
intervals. However, ASIP managers currently lack a toolset and process
to re-evaluate life and inspection intervals for an individual aircraft,
 flown by a unique pilot, carrying a particular payload configuration,
and burning fuel throughout.     This toolset and process should receive
 the recorded flight data (e.g., aircraft states, control surface
deflections, fuel level, stores configuration) as inputs. The real-time
aeroservoelastic simulation must be physics based, and capable of
incorporating variation in pilot, vehicle mass\/inertia, manufacture,
and repair history. The process should produce an updated life
prediction and inspection interval based on damage tolerance analysis
which utilizes the more realistic and accurate dynamic loadings obtained
 from simulation.       PHASE I:  Demonstrate feasibility for
quantifying variation in dynamic loads due to changes in vehicle
inertial properties from mission to mission. The dynamic loads include
both 1) surface pressures on the air vehicle and   2) big
bone\/component loads such as wing root bending. This task can be
accomplished with a finite element model and an aerodynamics model
derived from an outer moldline.      PHASE II:  Integrate the dynamic
loads variational capability developed in Phase I into a relevant
6-degrees of freedom (DOF)-vehicle simulation environment. Identify
critical maneuvers\/flight conditions via enhanced 6-DOF simulation and
application of the resulting loads spectra to the air vehicle finite
element model (AV FEM). Identify critical stress regions (hot spots)
within the AV FEM. Establish correlation between these global hot spots
and an individual structural component damage tolerance model.
PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  The resulting capability has
applications in both 1) prototype development activities and 2) service
life extension programs.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  The objective is to develop a
structural reliability analysis calculation tool that has the capability
 and flexibility to correctly model the physics of the variety of
possible post-inspection structural repair options.       DESCRIPTION:
The current structural reliability analysis software used by the USAF
models the post-inspection condition of the structure as a repair crack
size distribution only. Such a model for a post-inspection repair is
adequate if the repair is oversizing a fastener hole up to the second
oversize. But if the repair is a doubler, or an interference fit
bushing, the repair crack size distribution cannot capture the changes
in the crack growth curve or maximum stresses in the part. A structural
reliability analysis tool is needed that has multiple options for
changing the reliability calculation inputs after an inspection. Since
the type of repair performed is dependent upon the size of the crack
found during the inspection, more than a single repair model is
required.  Furthermore, because the repair options for different
airframe locations are different, the models for repairs and when they
are applied needs to be flexible so that the reliability analyst can
select which models to use and when they are applied. Repairs to be
considered are oversizing of fastener holes and patches at a minimum.
   Object-oriented modeling software, like ModelCenter or SPISE, for
example, have created modeling environments in which it is possible to
construct a flexible engineering analysis tool. Basic function routines
can be created as modules. These modules have specified inputs and
outputs. They form the building blocks for constructing an engineering
model. These modules are linked together in different ways and are used
over and over again in building the model.      While it seems that
structural reliability analysis would lend itself to models constructed
in one of these object-oriented environments, it is not clear how this
can be done. The fundamental routines for structural reliability
analysis need to be determined and developed into modules.  Examples of
two modules needed, based on routines in the current reliability
analysis tools, are probability of crack detection during nondestructive
 inspections (NDIs) and probability of failure. The framework for how
these modules should be linked together in order to perform a structural
 reliability analysis needs to be developed. Finally, the flexibility of
 this framework needs to be demonstrated for a number of different
structural components.  The intent of this project is not to develop an
object-oriented modeling environment.  It is rather to build a
structural reliability analysis framework within a commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) object-oriented modeling environment. This
framework must have the flexibility to accommodate the variety of
possible repair scenarios and their effect on the random variables in a
structural reliability analysis of fatigue in metallic structures:
fracture toughness, crack size, and maximum stress during a flight.
  PHASE I:  Phase I will develop the basic routines needed for
structural reliability analysis into reusable modules for a particular
object-oriented modeling environment. These modules will be demonstrated
 by simulating reliability analysis for the lifetime of a single
structural component.      PHASE II:  Phase II will develop the ability
to statistically update the prior reliability analysis for a location
based upon new information such as the size of any cracks found during
inspections or what repair was actually performed.  This capability will
 be demonstrated by performing reliability analyses over the lifetime of
 multiple different structural components. The demonstration will take
place at WPAFB. A manual describing how to use the software will be
required.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III applications
of this reliability analysis technology include all USAF aircraft
systems. Application to Army, Navy, and commercial aircraft is possible,
 but will require that some additional modules be developed since each
organization has slightly different requirements.",

System",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a fiber-optic-distributed
sensor system that will sense bleed air leaks in the propulsion,
environmental control, and thermal management systems (TMSs) to increase
 survivability throughout the operating mission of advanced tactical
aircraft.       DESCRIPTION:  Advanced tactical aircraft are required to
 provide protection to fire throughout the operating mission flight
envelope. The aircraft structure is vulnerable to excessive temperatures
 over long periods of time when exposed to hot gas leaks from the
propulsion, environmental control systems, and TMSs on the aircraft. The
 distributed temperature sensing technology would increase the
survivability of fighter aircraft against bleed air leaks. The purpose
of this technology would be to allow the fighter aircraft to extend the
amount of time that it could engage in conducting its mission without
restricting the overall flight time before a bleed air leak condition is
 detected. This technology allows greater accuracy in detection of bleed
 air leak by reducing the amount of nuisance trip indications by
providing greater resolution into the high end of the trip-detection
band. When a bleed air leak detect condition is reported, then this
technology will decrease the maintenance support time by providing
maintenance personnel with the information needed to exactly pinpoint
where the root cause is located in the equipment bay or duct, improving
the aircraft readiness rate. The purpose of this program is to develop a
 distributed temperature sensing system to provide more robust and
accurate fire-protection, leak-detection alarm capabilities and improved
 fault diagnostic capabilities.      The existing fire-protection bleed
air leak detect system technology alarm trip conditions are highly
dependent on multiple conditions. The individual alarm trip points can
vary over very large tolerances and are dependent on mission flight
profile, ambient temperature, air speed before and during the bleed air
leak detect alarm condition, engine conditions, air flow through
equipment bay, and temperature over the sensor. Future aircraft are
continuing to look at enhanced mission operating characteristics that
demand longer flight times at low and fast airspeeds in hot ambient
environments. The current methods used for detecting bleed air leaks in
fighter aircraft equipment bays will continue to push the limits of the
conventional technology alarm trip points and diagnosing and isolating
the exact fault location along the temperature sensors will become
increasingly difficult on future aircraft. The new fiber-optic
technology offers the ability to accurately sense the temperature of the
 air temperature in the surrounding area adjacent to the sensors with
the ability to provide enhanced fault diagnostics for future fighter
aircraft. Innovation is required to reduce the size and weight of the
optical time domain reflector meter instrumentation and routing of the
fiber optics inside a small fighter aircraft equipment bay. The
fiber-optic-distributed temperature sensing electronic system must be
able to sense up to 565 degrees for alarm temperatures in a hot air
equipment bay environment up to 15 m in length in eight channels. The
spatial resolution must be 0.127 m at an acquisition rate of 0.5 Hz. The
 maximum power consumption should be 33 W at 28 VDC. The aircraft
interface shall be IEEE 1394b"Firewire"SAE AS5643 compliant to industry
standards. The operating temperature ranges from -60 to 160 degrees F
and pressures ranging from atmospheric pressure down to 50,000 feet in
altitude. In addition, the sensor probe must be compatible with fuel and
 fuel vapors. The sensor system must be intrinsically safe and survive
under shock and vibration loading during takeoff, landing, and mission
profiles. Prime contractor collaboration is highly encouraged.
PHASE I:  Design and demonstrate feasibility of a
fiber-optic-distributed temperature sensing used for detecting bleed air
 leaks in fighter aircraft. Control and operation of a feasible

Sensor Design and Applications",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop an innovative engine sensor
system for harsh environmental conditions that is more reliable and
affordable than existing passive control and monitoring sensors for
legacy and future turbine engine platforms.       DESCRIPTION:  A
significant challenge in developing aerospace engine and vehicle sensor
systems is reliability. The issues involve multiple considerations,
including the use environment, materials, architecture, redundancy, and
communication. Sensor systems are also susceptible to noise and other
sources of error that make understanding and effectively solving
reliability problems difficult. On new platforms, the number of sensors,
 their performance requirements, and the environmental constraints are
increasing due to control system designs that provide increased
performance and efficiency. However, the fielded reliability of
state-of-the-art (SOA) sensor technology, including active and passive
sensors, has not correspondingly kept pace with new engine designs. SOA
engine position and feedback sensors operate over temperatures of 200
degrees C. They typically are designed for a mean time between failure
(MTBF) reliability over 100,000 flight hours. However, fielded
application data show that mean time between maintenance actions (MTBM)
and MTBF reliability can be an order of magnitude (10x) or lower,
compared with predicted capability. SOA temperature, pressure, and
diagnostic (vibration) sensors operate at gas temperatures between -55
degrees C to over 650 degrees C and are also top maintenance drivers due
 to lower reliability values achieved compared with SOA design and test
experience. Reliability performance in harsh fielded conditions is
therefore a limiting factor in achieving high reliability and low
maintainability in control systems for new platforms. Current employment
 of physical redundancy, sensor fusion, instrumentation, and software
health management techniques are used to facilitate system reliability
and meet design goals, but system cost and reliability for advanced
systems are issues that remain to be addressed. Recent developments in
materials science, micro-electromechanical (MEMS) systems, and
communications approaches are smart sensing techniques that will enable
new approaches to improve the reliability of sensing and control systems
 employed in aerospace systems. It is desirable to improve advanced
sensor system reliability by design and evaluation of new approaches
that accommodate existing hardware and software architectures to the
maximum extent practical. Sensors for critical engine measurements
include temperature, pressure, speed, and position. Investigation of
passive and active redundancy approaches in smart sensor design,
enhanced environmental capability, mechanical design, and MEMS component
 reliability are appropriate. Passive redundancy is a way to ensure
against failure by providing alternate (unpowered) pathways for
operation of mechanical or electrical loads when one path fails.
Enhanced environmental tolerance using new material and design systems
allow operation with higher thermal and vibrational loads while reducing
 wear and damage. Smart sensing concepts can employ numerous methods to
increase reliability including measuring electrical signals directly in
mitigating and flagging environmental effects such as corrosion and wear
 and increasing reliability. In Phase II, a new sensor architecture will
 be developed at an appropriate partitioning and integration level that
employs advanced analytical, electrical, or mechanical hardware
techniques that improves reliability compared with current SOA passive
or active sensors. Measurement systems for pressure, temperature, and
acceleration are suitable candidates for improvement. Demonstration of
sensor system reliability improvement using modeling, accelerated life
testing or other appropriate stress testing methodologies is required.
Delivery of prototype hardware, software, and algorithms to the Air
Force is required to facilitate further testing after Phase II. Working
with an engine original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or control system
vendor is recommended to enhance the relevance and transition ability of
 the final research product.       PHASE I:  Demonstrate the feasibility
 of applying high reliability and failure stability design techniques to
 an advanced smart sensor, temperature, pressure, or position sensing
system for a turbine engine. Evaluate improvements over current SOA
engine controls. Develop preliminary transition plan and business case

        "topic_name": "Improved Design Package for Fracture Mechanics
Analysis",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop an improved software design
package that better accounts for short crack effects in crack growth.
    DESCRIPTION:  Linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) methods are
used extensively in aerospace to perform crack growth life predictions.
These methods are sometimes erroneously applied in cases where the
initial defect size assumptions are outside the range of strict LEFM
applicability. Typically this occurs when starting flaw size assumptions
 are on the same order as the length scale of the microstructure. One
relevant example would be titanium alloys optimized for slow fatigue
crack growth.      This technical deficiency leads to significant errors
 or uncertainty in the life predictions that can result in unreliable
designs or excessive conservatism. In order to facilitate the design of
more reliable &amp; efficient aerospace structures, methods are needed
to establish when conventional LEFM methods may be applied with
confidence and new methods are required for microstructurally short
cracks, where LEFM is not applicable.      Methods are desired that
accurately determine where conventional LEFM approaches can be applied
based on flaw size, orientation, material, and applied loading. Methods
for accurate damage propagation prediction outside of the traditional
LEFM regime (small crack growth) are also desirable. A physically
accurate treatment of the problem is favored over empirical approaches.
Extensions of previously existing packages are favored to enhance
opportunities for commercialization.      PHASE I:  Develop a method for
 damage tolerant design with flaw sizes below the range of LEFM
applicability (short crack regime). The method should include the
ability to account for material, crack size, shape, and applied loading.
 The method should be validated using coupon tests. A development plan
to mature the method as a viable design tool must be developed.
PHASE II:  The Phase II effort will implement the developed method(s) in
 a validated design package. The design package should be effective in
both the short crack and long crack regimes. Prototype software versions
 are desired for government evaluation. Small evaluation efforts with
aerospace original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are encouraged to
enhance opportunities for commercialization.      PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: Fracture mechanics software applications are used
extensively throughout the commercial aerospace, marine, civil, and
automotive engineering communities.",

        "topic_name": "Modular Flexible Weapons Integration",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop store carriage technology
for advanced aircraft that will increase weapons load out, reduce drag,
extend range, and not compromise survivability over current carriage
techniques.       DESCRIPTION:  The mission of tactical, strike, and
attack aircraft, manned or unmanned, is to deliver an effective load of
weapons to the designated target with minimal collateral damage. In
order to accomplish this mission, both external and internal store
(bombs, missiles, fuel tanks, electronics pods, etc.) carriage
methodologies have been used in the past with success. Innovative
external carriage and release concepts are required to meet the need to
carry larger weapons payloads with minimal impact to range and
survivability of the current and future aircraft.      The existing
F-15, F-16, and F-18 fleet carry external weapons, as will all three
variants of the F-35 aircraft. The variety of stores carried externally
is challenging to all aspects of weapons integration, from simply
fitting the stores onto the airframe, to aircraft handling and control.
Separation is especially difficult as additional stores are added; the
aerodynamic interactions become more interdependent. A good example is
the F-18E\/F where significant effort was required to counter the
adverse fuel tank aerodynamics in order to allow store separation (see
reference 2, 14-1 to 14-12). In that particular case, all pylons on the
aircraft were toed 4 degrees nose outboard and additional structural
issues had to be addressed. Modifications of this type can be effective
but lack the elegance desired for effective integration of externally
carried weapons.      Many studies have been performed looking at
methods for reduced drag, improved separation and even reduced impact on
 aircraft signature for external store carriage. In the early 1970s,
conformal carriage studies were conducted for the F-4 Phantom to reduce
drag. Additional studies have addressed conformal carriage,
semisubmerged carriage, and light weight structures (shrouds, etc.)
mounted to the external store for improved carriage performance.
External carriage and radar cross section seem to be at odds; however,
innovative methods for shape modification, appropriately designed
external pods, and specialized materials need to be explored to improve
weapons load out while maintaining acceptable signature levels.
One of the largest volume stores carried on most aircraft is the
external fuel tank. These all have a similar look to maximize the volume
 of fuel that can be carried. Conformal fuel tanks and collapsible
concepts have been put forth as reduced drag alternatives with varying
degrees of acceptance. One recent study has shown that aerodynamic
shaping can be used to reduce drag and improve store separation
characteristics near these large external stores (see reference 5). This
 area has a large potential for improved range\/energy efficiency.
 With this background, the Air Force is interested in technologies that
can improve delivery of weapons to the target. The scale of the platform
 to be considered is representative of the F-35 both in size and flight
regime of interest. The goal is to have multiple innovative external
carriage concepts produced with computational, as well as experimental,
evidence that the concepts will perform with better characteristics than
 traditional external carriage. Considerations of impact on aircraft
range, weapons separation, performance and handling, as well as
survivability, should be considered.       PHASE I:  Multiple unique
external carriage concepts will be developed. An
engineering\/preliminary design review (form, fit, function, weights and
 balances) will be conducted to evaluate the potential of candidate
concepts to yield achievable performance gains. Limited
computational\/experimental data will be required to evaluate concepts.
Plan testing and refinement of the most successful concepts in Phase II.
      PHASE II:  During this phase, evaluation and refinement of
concepts will be achieved. Both computational and experimental testing
and validation of concepts will be accomplished.  The analysis should
include computational and\/or experimental assessment of drag,
separation, and signature. Possible preparation for flight test may be
required depending on the concepts explored and funding level.
PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Weapons carriage technologies developed
 could be applied to legacy military aircraft for improved performance,
increased weapons load out, etc. Commercially, extended range fuel tanks
 and drag reduction technologies may be applied.",

        "topic_name": "Air Cycle Toolsets for Aircraft Thermal
Management System (TMS) Optimization",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Development of complementary
hardware and software toolsets which allow assessment and
characterization of different military aircraft air cycle or
hybrid-cycle thermal management system architectures.       DESCRIPTION:
  Current tactical aircraft face enormous challenges associated with
increasing operational envelope while reducing fuel burn. To that aim,
there is a growing desire within the power and thermal systems community
 to explore the hybridization of complementary thermal cycles as a means
 for improving tactical aircraft thermal management system (TMS) energy
efficiency and dynamic responsiveness. To accomplish this, a flexible
set of air cycle hardware components coupled with validated
computational models are required for hardware-in-the-loop system
development and performance assessment activities. It is envisioned that
 these toolsets could be used to explore impacts of different potential
air cycle system (ACS) configurations on overall vehicle TMS performance
 in both steady state and dynamic operation. The data obtained from
these studies could then be used for assessment and optimization of
vehicle TMS against developer-defined mission parameters including
vehicle speed, altitude, and accessory power and thermal needs.      To
realize this vision, several significant technical challenges must be
addressed. Specifically, co-development of rugged ACS wheel sets
(compressors and turbines) which incorporate interchangeable, reusable,
and reliable pneumatic and rotational interconnects with complementary
computational models which facilitate selection of appropriate
wheel-pairs is necessary. It is anticipated that this activity will
result in the demonstration of a series of radial or axial air cycle
compressors and turbine wheels that can be mounted (onto a drive stand
or high-speed rotational drive) into three or more different
configurations in order to explore potential tactical aircraft mission
scenarios. Further, these components would permit operation in
conjunction with other TMS subsystems (cooled air to vapor compression
systems) to explore promising vehicle-level TMS architectures. A set of
complementary computational models is also required to analytically
predict thermodynamic performance, aerodynamic performance, and consider
 mechanical safety of the high speed rotational machinery tools.
For the purposes of this tool demonstration, all componentry should be
designed to be operated onto a typical high speed (60 krpm, 10 to 100
kWth, 300 kWrot) drive stand (dynamometer) or similar high-speed motor
with minimal rebalancing of each of the ACS wheels between tests.
Further, the offeror must demonstrate that an appropriate number of
wheel pairs could be independently configured such that the final
toolset is flexible and not an ACS point design. Phase II deliverables
should include two to three compressor wheel sets, one to two turbine
wheel sets, reconfigurable ducting for pneumatic connectivity, and
complementary Matlab (or similar environment) open-source codes.      A
particular design point of interest includes delivery of 1 pps (lb\/s)
of air at 40 to 70 degrees F at a delivery pressure of no less than 100
psi from ambient air (~90 degrees F, 14.7 psi). A secondary design point
 would include delivery of 1 pps of air at 40 degrees F from
precompressed 300 psi, 100 degrees F supply air. Power generation is of
secondary importance.      PHASE I:  In context of modern high
performance aircraft TMS specifications, demonstrate feasibility of
developing a set of ACS hardware toolsets which meet the topic
objectives. Develop and demonstrate a set of computational toolsets to
facilitate appropriate and safe pairing of compressor and turbine wheel
sets.      PHASE II:  Develop and demonstrate a prototype version of the
 ACS wheel sets designed under the Phase I activity. Demonstrate that
these tools can be used to simulate two or more vehicle ACS
configurations in terms of power, pressure ratio, or discharge
temperatures based upon the notional vehicle"s performance desirements
developed during the Phase I. Identify necessary facility or testing
requirements necessary to operate the tools over USAF relevant
operational tactical fighter mission scenarios.      PHASE III DUAL USE

units for commercial aircraft APUs, ground carts, and pressurization
units.",

Suppressed Trajectories for Hypersonic Testing",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop an innovative approach(es)
for new and\/or existing launch systems to execute suppressed
trajectories for hypersonic flight testing. Perform analysis and testing
 to mature technology, validate models, reduce risk, and demonstrate
capability.       DESCRIPTION:  The Air Force is working on
next-generation hypersonic systems for various missions, including
high-speed strike, space access, and penetrating intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (IS &amp; R). Conducting affordable
flight testing is necessary to understanding physical phenomena,
validating models, and building stakeholder support. In hypersonic
testing, getting the test article into the necessary test window with
the required flight environment can be challenging, given existing
booster systems. Getting into relevant test windows for extended test
times usually requires challenging suppressed trajectories that
state-of-the-art booster systems have difficulty achieving. A trajectory
 can be considered suppressed if it does not utilize exoatmospheric
flight prior to entering hypersonic flight environments.     As an
example, the HIFiRE-2 Program required a suppressed trajectory for
propulsion testing. The flight vehicle used three solid boosters,
coasting gravity turns, and risky timing techniques to ignite upper
stages. This suppressed trajectory included multiple unpowered passes
through transonic flight, creating high uncertainty.     Capabilities of
 systems to be developed under this effort include one or more of the
following: reduction of software verification and validation,
simplification in meeting test range safety requirements, simplification
 in test range integration, reduction of uncertain flight environments
(e.g., transonic), reduction in stages, reduction in additional
hardware, reduction of undesirable loads on the payload (e.g., acoustic,
 vibration, heating), maximization of test time, reduction of ground
infrastructure and personnel, reduction in aerodynamic loads, and
allowing for a more vertical launch direction from the ground (not
applicable to air-launched systems). For the purposes of this SBIR
solicitation, these desired capabilities are considered of roughly equal
 importance.     The approaches developed under this effort will need to
 be demonstrated as enabling at least one government-supplied test
window. It is anticipated that test windows defined by parameters such
as dynamic pressure, Mach number, angle of attack, and flight path angle
 will be provided. A sample test window includes Mach 4 to 8 and dynamic
 pressures from 1,000 psf to 3,000 psf. The offeror"s proposed approach
should maximize coverage of the government-supplied test windows. These
test windows are subject to modifications during Phase I.      Candidate
 technology approaches could include new booster systems, fin set
upgrades for existing systems, new control algorithms and effectors,
trajectory shaping, and\/or rocket motor throttling\/gimbaling. A
proposed solution could include a single or combination of methods.
Both Phase I and Phase II will consist of an appropriate level of design
 and systems engineering efforts to understand what it will take to make
 the proposed solution(s) operational. These efforts should address all
lifecycle issues but focus in on the demonstrations that will be
conducted in Phase II.     For the purpose of Phase I proposals, the
payload can be assumed to have the following characteristics: 300-lbm
gross weight, 2-ft length, 6-inch diameter, 30-percent front is a
blunted ogive with the rest being a cylinder, and 20-percent increase in
 drag on the stage attached to the payload (to account for inlets,
exhaust ports, and\/or surface irregularities). It is desirable for
technology approach(es) to be scalable to systems supporting larger
payloads and\/or more energetic trajectories.      Computational
resources from the DoD Supercomputing Resource Center (DSRC) will be
provided at no additional cost for use on this effort to appropriately
cleared contractor personnel.      PHASE I:  Investigate innovative
approaches to achieve the test windows. Define the system requirements
for the solution(s). Define trajectories for the test windows. Early
verification and validation by analysis of the solution(s) to achieve
reference trajectories, meet requirements and meet testing needs.
Develop integration,  verification and validation plans for the entire
system and tests for Phase II.      PHASE II:  Further refine and
develop a detailed-level design of proposed solution(s). Update as
needed the integration, verification, and validation plans focusing on
the Phase II efforts. Fabricate, assemble, and integrate the items for
testing. Conduct testing to mature the technology solutions. Tests will
provide insight into how the solution(s) support suppressed
trajectories. At the end of Phase II, viability is shown with testing,
design analysis, and future development planning.      PHASE III DUAL
USE APPLICATIONS: Potential commercial applications include providing
launch services and\/or launch hardware to support development of
hypersonic technology and systems such as a hypersonic IS &amp; R
aircraft, an upper stage for a space-access vehicle, or a tactical

Aircraft Heat Exchanger\/Condenser Applications",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and evaluate innovative
concepts to minimize icing in heat exchanger\/condenser applications
associated with an air cycle machine for aircraft cooling requirements.
     DESCRIPTION:  The demand for thermally unconstrained operations for
 aircraft has been driving the research of integrated thermal management
 designs for several years. Recent turbine engine efforts have focused
on increasing the available air heat sink to help meet thermal
requirements affected by the steady growth of avionics heat loads. Use
of these cooler air heat sinks to dump aircraft heat loads can be
improved through additional analysis\/research of methods to reduce the
impact of icing that may occur in heat exchanger\/condenser components
associated with aircraft thermal management. Approaches might include
the development of ice resistant (ice phobic) coatings and\/or the
design of condenser equipment that partitions passageways or redirects
available airflows to minimize icing conditions.      Condenser icing is
 a concern for aircraft air conditioning systems using a high-pressure
water separator to remove moisture from cooling air supplied to
equipment and the cockpit. A high-pressure water separator includes an
air-to-air condenser heat exchanger. The condenser causes water droplets
 to form on the hot side fin surfaces by transferring heat from a cold
side air stream. The condensed water droplets are then removed by a
centrifugal device, and cool, relatively dry air is supplied to the
equipment and the cockpit. In general, a cross-flow designed condenser
may operate in a moist environment, with warm air entering at station 1
and exiting at station 3 after being cooled by cross-flow air generated
by a cooling turbine at station 2. Both the hot and cold sides of the
condenser contain moisture and have the potential to form ice. Table 1
provides typical operating conditions for this type design. Note that at
 station 3, the temperature is only 3 degrees F above freezing. Current
state-of-the-art condensers operate ~ 8 to 12 degrees F above freezing
to minimize ice build-up on the condenser heat transfer surfaces. A
lower allowable temperature at station 3 would reduce the amount of air
required to cool equipment and condition the cockpit. This lower air
flow would reduce the amount of energy extracted from the propulsion
system, resulting in lower fuel consumption for the same mission.

        "topic_name": "Smart Aircraft Conceptual Design in
Multidisplinary Design Optimization",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate a smart
conceptual design tool to enable improved estimates of performance,
including weight and balance associated with early definition of
subsystems layout and integration.       DESCRIPTION:  A conceptual
design is characterized as authentic (a closed design) when it includes
an authentic development process to define primary parameters that
predict the aircraft"s major components and attributes: airframe (could
be manufactured), it"s aerodynamic shape (promises flight worthiness),
and its propulsion (performance could be achieved). In such a
development process, basic engineering and technology assumptions are
made. These must be evaluated by further rigorous analysis and\/or
limited experiments (such as wind tunnel test). This work either
verifies the goodness of the design or directs the need for change;
specialists are part of the team. When design satisfaction is achieved
(low technical risk), a much larger design-manufacturing-administrative
team, may then be assigned-and their associated large support funding.
This smart conceptual design approach shall differ from the major
aircraft industry; it will not likely be able to afford major technical
computational and 3-D graphics tools (CATIA, Unigraphics, etc.) and the
dedicated individuals who must retain full proficiency in their use. It
also differs in that the small team designer(s) must have broader
expertise in aeronautical science than one who is tasked only with
complex graphical configuration development. The usual fallback from
these advanced tools, for the limited aircraft industry, is the drafting
 board. It provides integration; the external aircraft shape (a
three-view drawing) with the internal subsystems (an inboard profile) in
 one area-on the board. However, this 2-D approach is one to be
superseded with a smart semi-automation tool, possibly based on a
generic algorithm to cut through the ambiguity of tentative
requirements, and to produce a prioritized range of candidate concepts.
This part of the tool set is to allow quick development of multiple
design choices by a small team or single designer. The primary
conceptual design parameters for either the major or limited companies
are: the external aerodynamic shape\/volume, the speed-altitude region
of operation and the associated internal and structural architecture.
The architecture of the subsystems is defined by their
weight\/shape\/function\/location\/servicing and their impact on the
flight balance\/inertia of the overall design. The minimum, in weight
definition terms, are: the structural group, the propulsion group, and
the equipment group. These then sum to be the empty weight of the
vehicle. The payload, fuel, and crew (if any) are added to this empty
weight to define the final Normal Takeoff Gross Weight (NTOGW). The
definition (the design) of the internal airframe subsystems includes:
installation, strength, thermal environment, power and other special
considerations. The engine installation, landing gear arrangement, and
external packages also require attention. The weight of the smaller
child-components of the subsystems (the sub-subsystems) shall be
included in their parent subsystem weight, and their volume allowance
must be included in the outer aerodynamic shape"s volume. All of this
defining design data will be described in lists, diagrams, tables, and
with a 3-D configuration graphic(s). The latter shall show a colored
rendering and also translucent views showing the major subsystems. The
design is checked for stability, control, and aero-elasticity integrity.
 It may also be exposed to technology trades, requirement trades,
configuration trades, concept comparisons, operational simulations or
cost estimation. The conceptual design tool-set must be flexible
(probably modular) to handle different classes of aircraft, and
nonconventional arrangements. When a final design is obtained (fixed), a
 larger group of tech specialists takes over for the detail design and
manufacturing effort.      PHASE I:  Demonstrate the feasibility of an
overall fixed wing smart conceptual design tool; it may contain new or
modified sub-tools. It shall avoid high maintenance (dedicated human
proficiency) needs, and its 3-D parametric graphics integration task
must bypass the simple 2-D drafting board approach. The development of
an intuitive graphics approach is a critical goal of Phase I.      PHASE
 II:  This phase will follow through to develop a smooth integration of
the sub-tools and associated data bases (e.g., subsystems) that support a
 fully developed ready to go computerized conceptual design tool.
Several classes of military aircraft shall be demonstrated (fighters,
transports, bombers). A user instruction manual shall be a part of the
final report. Hypersonic, airships and rotary wing design cases are not
included in the present scope of the effort.      PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: Applications include USAF and other service aircraft, and
also commercial and general aviation aircraft. The tool shall be able to
 handle new designs or legacy aircraft modifications. The tool should be
 modular to enable learning: technology variations, special design
cases, updates in procedures.",

Systems",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Development of physics-based
engineering models and corresponding validation procedures as well as
associated modules\/libraries for radiation heat transfer prediction in
combustion systems of relevance to the Air Force (AF).
DESCRIPTION:  Advanced physics-based modeling and simulation (M &amp; S)
 tools are playing an increasingly important role in the design of
high-performing combustion devices for AF propulsion systems such as
rockets, gas turbines, and scramjet combustors. The prediction of engine
 performance, reliability, and lifetime typically requires the use of
coupled multiphysics models. Among relevant physical phenomena,
radiation becomes increasingly important at elevated engine working
temperature and pressure, especially applicable to large-scale scramjet
(e.g., 10X) and high-pressure liquid rockets. Two major impact areas of
radiation are 1) combustion process that is crucial to performance and
2) thermal management that is critical to structural design and engine
weight [1,2]. Inclusion of radiation heat transfer models that are
properly coupled with the turbulence and combustion are critical in
engine M &amp; S tools.      This topic concerns the development of
physics-based engineering radiation models for relevant regimes covering
 high-pressure (&gt;100 atm) and high-speed (supersonic\/hypersonic)
turbulent reacting flow conditions. This effort will take advantage of
recent, state-of-the-art developments in fundamental radiation
algorithmic approaches such as those supported by AFOSR and other
agencies. The starting point of the effort requires an evaluation of the
 existing models, including their fundamental assumptions with respect
to AF applications. The effort is interested in innovative, sufficiently
 accurate, and efficient models and procedures for 1) spatial
integration of the radiation transfer equation (RTE), such as other
spatial integrations based on spherical harmonics, discrete ordinates,
zonal methods, Monte Carlo or similar methods [3]; 2) spectral
integration dealing with the complex spectrum of hydrocarbon combustion
products relevant and important to AF propulsion systems; and 3)
coupling between spatial and spectral integrations. The models are
expected to operate within a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes or a large
eddy simulations solution procedure. Related approaches that incorporate
 the effects of turbulence-radiation interactions as well as
radiation-chemistry coupling [4] are also of interest. In addition,
radiative properties of soot and the effects of carbon deposits on
chamber walls are relevant [5]. An additional area of interest is
solution procedures to determine the state of the flow from emission and
 absorption measurements [6]. In all cases, the models should be capable
 of operating efficiently in a distributed computing environment. Model
predictions should be validated versus relevant data being obtained by
related AFOSR and\/or AFRL programs. Reacting boundary layers with
injected liquid and gas hydrocarbon fuel coolant films are of particular
 interest. Model development should be carried out in a modular fashion
through the specification of standardized application programming
interfaces (APIs), which would enable the models to be available as
plug-in libraries for computation fluid dynamics (CFD) codes of

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and validate a lightweight,
detachable roll control system design that can be integrated with a
solid rocket motor and successfully control the motor"s spin rate.
 DESCRIPTION:  The current Minuteman III (MM III) guidance system
requires the vehicle to minimize the spin rate by utilizing a roll
control system. The roll control system itself is relatively large and
heavy, which influences the design of the overall motor. The current
roll control system is only on the Second and Third Stage motors due to
the motors having single, fixed nozzles. The First Stage motor has four
nozzles, and thus has roll control capability and no need for an
additional roll control system. However, the future upgrade\/replacement
 motors for all three stages will most likely contain single flex-seal
nozzles due to the direction the Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) industry has
progressed. The SRM industry has been driven towards this nozzle
configuration to minimize cost and maximize performance while still
being able to control thrust vectoring. Additionally, the SRM industry
has no high demand need to control the motor spin rate on their
commercial motors because the current guidance technologies that they
use are not affected by spin rate. The MM III guidance system on the
other hand is still affected by spin rate until it can be replaced by an
 updated guidance system. The MM III guidance system will get upgraded
in the future, but it is likely not to occur before the current MM III
motors are upgraded\/replaced.  This means that the new SRMs replacing
the current MM III motors will need to still have a roll control system
to control the motor"s spin rate. Since the current roll control system
is quite bulky, it would be advantageous to have a small, lightweight,
simple roll control system for SRMs with single, flex-seal nozzles. It
will also help if this system was separate from the SRM and easily
removable. This way once the MM III guidance system is upgraded, the
roll control system can be taken off from the SRMs already fielded. The
process of placing the roll control system on the SRMs can also then be
skipped on those motors that have yet to be built or placed in the
field. This capability will allow for easier life maintenance and a
lower life-cycle cost of the SRMs.      PHASE I:  Create a conceptual
design for a detachable, lightweight roll control system. Demonstrate
the feasibility of the conceptual design. Identify the required control
authority, mechanical interfaces, components, and overall system
architecture and demonstrate feasibility through simulation, analysis,
or other means.      PHASE II:  Refine conceptual design completed in
Phase I SBIR, include impacts to current weapon system. Validate design
and critical technologies by appropriate methods including but not
limited to building a sub-scale prototype along with companion
simulation and analysis.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:
Detachable, lightweight roll control system could be applicable to
rocket motor use for those organizations who wish to go with a less
expensive guidance system. The detachable, lightweight roll control
system could be used as a replacement in the future upgrade\/replacement
 motors for the MM III.",

        "topic_name": "Additive manufacturing of Liquid Rocket Engine
Components",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate additive
manufacturing processes for low-rate production of highly complex liquid
 rocket engine components.       DESCRIPTION:  Manufacturing process
development for rocket applications poses significant technical
challenges due to the low production rate, the high complexity of the
parts, and the harsh environments in which the parts must operate. The
typical production rate for liquid rocket engines (LREs) is typically in
 the 10"s per year. This means typical assembly line or casting-type
processes with dedicated machinery are likely to be cost inefficient.
Additionally, these parts are typically very complex with the need for
precision shapes, tight tolerances, and high repeatability in order to
ensure identical engine-to-engine performance. Currently, designers must
 make compromises in the design of components such as impellers and
inducers that have highly complex internal flow geometries that would be
 difficult to repeatedly and cost effectively manufacture at low
production rates with current processes. These challenges do not lend
themselves to traditional manufacturing options.  Various components
within the engine can be subject to very low temperatures (as low as
-253 degrees C if Liquid Hydrogen propellant is being used) or very high
 combustion temperatures (&gt;2000 degrees C). Pressures can range up to
 10,000 psi.      Considering these challenges, the development and
application of additive manufacturing (AM) are highly desired due to the
 potential to increase the performance and affordability of rocket
propulsion.  These features are critical to the advancement of space
access and DoD missile programs. One of the advantages of AM is
precisely that it can be used for low production rate components since
it does not require time-consuming and expensive setups and the machine
can easily be reconfigured to produce different parts.  In addition, the
 actual time needed for machining a part can be much shorter than with
conventional machines. In some instances, the manufacturing time has
gone from weeks to days. The relevant Phase III IHPRPT goals are 100%
increase in thrust to weight ratio and 35% reduction in hardware cost
over baseline.  The development effort should demonstrate significantly
shortened lead times for small number of parts while reducing part
weight and cost. This needs to be accomplished without sacrificing
tolerances and maintaining acceptable surface finish.       Development
efforts using additive manufacturing are anticipated to provide
significant enhancement over existing domestic and foreign
state-of-the-art materials processes. To increase the probability of
successful transition to Phase III demonstration or other application
areas, the technology development efforts proposed should leverage
existing capability and rocket technology development efforts to the
maximum extent possible.      PHASE I:  Demonstrate feasibility &amp;
benefits of additive manufacturing in terms of cost, producibility,
performance, etc. Design &amp; possibly build 1 or 2 LRE components,
including coupons for mechanical &amp; flammability properties testing,
with typical materials: Cu-alloys, Ti-6Al-4V, Monel. Discuss surface
finish attainable &amp; impacts to performance as well as potential
non-destructive inspection techniques.      PHASE II:  Finalize process
development for one or more materials. Confirm process by both
fabricating test articles for property determination and prototype LRE
component of the same size, shape, and complexity as advanced LRE parts.
 If possible, test built parts at representative LRE conditions.
Deliverables: Report of process development and property validation,
detailed plan for fabrication process, prototype LRE component,
marketing for Phase II Dual Use Applications, test results if
applicable.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This effort supports
current and future DoD space launch applications. It will also support
commercial and NASA space launch vehicle development.",

        "topic_name": "Lowest Lifecycle Cost (LLC) Expendable Launch
Vehicles",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Identify and validate high payoff
LLC propulsion technologies that are applicable to space launch and
large ballistic missile vehicle applications.       DESCRIPTION:
Current expendable launch vehicles are designed using an optimum
performance methodology. However, there have been numerous studies and
technology demonstrations that suggest designing to minimum cost may
have life cycle cost advantages over a performance optimized expendable
launch vehicle. Performance optimized launch vehicles tend to maximize
their payload mass fraction, or conversely, minimize their Gross
Lift-Off Weight (GLOW) for a given payload launched into its intended
mission orbit. Performance optimization requires high efficiency
propulsion and corresponding high propellant mass fractions. These
designs can be complex and have high manufacturing costs. On the other
hand, LLC strategies weigh the performance advantages of highly
optimized systems with simpler designs that have lower manufacturing
costs but a larger GLOW. It should be noted that this SBIR topic is
interested in proposals which can support existing National Security
Space (NSS) payload weights and orbital requirements which can exceed
25,000 lbs to Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO).     The classical optimum
performance methodologies have been demonstrated in multiple past
designs. However, the simpler design\/lower performance strategies have
not been implemented in great detail. There are two philosophies in
which these design configurations can be implemented. A traditional
low-cost design philosophy is to utilize a pressure-fed system to meet
requirements. While simpler pressure-fed strategies have appeal, they
have significant technical obstacles to overcome. Namely, the biggest
technical challenge is to successfully demonstrate a high thrust, lower
chamber pressure engine with manageable combustion stability margin.
Additionally, large diameter, high strength to weight, cryogenic
compatible pressure-fed tanks are also a key technology, allowing
realistic management of the vehicles GLOW and related manufacturing
costs. Finally, a compact and cost effective high performance propellant
 tank pressurization system is critical from a scalability and
reliability standpoint. Furthermore, high performance pressurization
systems that can demonstrate working fluids other than helium are of key
 importance because helium is a dwindling non-renewable strategic
resource. Finally, the increased size of the system may result in higher
 costs because of the need for additional engines.      A more recent
low-cost philosophy is to apply LLC principles to classical
performance-optimized pump-fed liquid propulsion components. This
approach recognizes that modern launch vehicle design has evolved based
on solving a myriad of conflicting physical and system engineering
realities. As a result, this technique decomposes traditional pump-fed
propulsion systems and examines where targeted technology insertion can
simplify the engines design, manufacturing and operational requirements.
 While both traditional and more recent strategies primarily target
engine chamber pressure as a first order cost driver, the latter
approach has more latitude than traditional low-cost designs in
preserving higher engine operating pressure under a given development
program. Therefore, this approach enjoys added design flexibility in
managing the combustion stability margin of the thrust chamber and\/or
preburner assemblies as well as maintaining sufficient throttle in the
system in order to minimize payload acceleration.       Within this
SBIR, it is expected that organizations will explore pressure fed
and\/or pump-fed low-cost propulsion technologies. It is acceptable to
apply different LLC propulsion strategies to individual launch vehicle
stages (e.g., mix and match pressure and pump fed stages). In order to
maintain similarity in approach and to ensure that payloads meet NSS
requirements, offerors are asked to utilize reference launch system to
support initial payload requirements of 30,000 lbs to Low Earth Orbit
(LEO) with a pre-defined modular growth path of 60,000 lbs payload that
avoids new engine developments. These payload requirements are only
intended to demonstrate vehicle scale requirements.      For the
reference vehicle, a Technology Development Plan\/Technical Roadmap will
 be developed that shows: 1) critical component traceability, 2) a
prioritized risk reduction strategy, 3) test and qualification
requirements and strategy, 4) estimated total cost and schedule for
Phase II and Phase III risk reduction activities. Assume in the
Technology Development Plan that Phase II is dedicated to high risk
subscale component(s) testing and Phase III is dedicated to either
subscale flight demonstration or full scale component(s) ground testing
(i.e., contractor defined). Present the conceptual LLC launch vehicle
and Technology Development Plan (Items 1-4 above) to the government for
review.       PHASE I:  Propose a Technology Development Plan\/Technical
 Roadmap for a Conceptual reference launch system which utilizes a low
cost design process. Describe how this concept will generate Lowest
Lifecycle Cost (LLC) design in comparison to performance optimized
solutions. Identify technologies that are key cost\/performance drivers
and those that are highest risk.      PHASE II:  perform risk reduction
testing as identified in the Technology Development Plan. Perform
detailed design, manufacture and test of identified high payoff\/high
risk subscale component(s). Use test data to update the Phase I
conceptual reference LLC launch vehicle to a mature conceptual design
level.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Develop and demonstrate a
low cost propulsion technology which will result in a LLC launch
vehicle. This will include a combination of development work, component
testing, and potentially system demonstrations.",

lifetime electric propulsion thrusters with wide throttle range for
orbit transfer of DoD space assets.       DESCRIPTION:  Electric
propulsion (EP) has the capability to greatly enhance the in-space
maneuverability and payload capacity of spacecraft compared to liquid
chemical propulsion. However, current electric propulsion devices do not
 provide enough thrust to perform some time critical maneuvers. For
example, advanced military communications satellites such as Advanced
EHF use a combination of chemical and high-power Hall thrusters for the
LEO to GEO orbit transfer. A satellite utilizing all electric propulsion
 would provide greater fraction of delivered payload than a chemical
system. However, increased duration in the belts with state-of-the-art
EP will have a detrimental impact on spacecraft mission lifetime due to
radiation damage to the solar arrays and payload electronics. Research
on innovative high power, high thrust, and inherently long lifetime
thrusters is required to realize the full advantages of electric
propulsion for DoD missions.      Advanced electric propulsion
technology with high efficiency over a wide range of specific impulse
and power levels would enable high thrust operation for rapid transit
through the belts, and high specific impulse for high efficiency from
the belts to GEO. This all electric propulsion system eliminates the
need for chemical thrusters and the mass of chemical propulsion
propellant, thereby maximizing payload to orbit and minimizing
propulsion system complexity.       This solicitation seeks research on
electric propulsion technologies capable of achieving specific impulse
from 1000-2000 seconds with total thruster efficiency greater than 60%
and thruster specific power less than 1 kg\/kW. Proposal solutions may
be either ideas for improving existing thruster technology or the
development of new concepts. A representative power level for this
technology is 5-10 kW per thruster, though demonstrations may be
conducted at different power levels to accommodate cost-effective
research activities. The full propulsion system (thruster, power
processing unit &amp; propellant feed) should define a clear path for
transition to military space applications in the proposal. The thruster
technology should be capable of supporting a 15-year mission in
Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) or Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and 5 years
 in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) after ground storage of 5 years.      PHASE I:
  Perform proof-of-concept analysis and experiments that demonstrate the

 thruster. Breadboard hardware will be evaluated on thrust stands at
AFRL, and achieve TRL 5 at the end of Phase II activities. Deliverables
include breadboard hardware, preliminary cost analyses, and full
performance analysis with comparison to state-of-the-art EP.      PHASE

propellant",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop innovative physics-based
models facilitating the accurate prediction of solid rocket propellant
behavior with varying environmental boundary conditions.
DESCRIPTION:  With the need to sustain the existing Air Force Solid
Rocket Motor (SRM) fleet for increasingly long times, accurate
prediction of SRM capabilities becomes crucial. The paradigm is to
predict the behavior of SRM propellant and the propellant, liner,
insulation (PLI) using empirical curve-fitting expressions extrapolated
out to the desired conditions. The above method leads to large potential
 errors (~55%) in predictions for history dependent materials such as
polymers. Hiu describes how elastomeric polymers fail earlier than
anticipated due to rate dependent bond rupture [1]. It would be
prohibitively expensive to test enough samples with different
environmental exposure histories to give adequate confidence in these
empirical methods. Thus a physics-based modeling approach is desired
where all of the parameters have physical meaning and may be linked to
boundary conditions (typical strategic environment 60-80 degrees
Fahrenheit with moderate humidity). A physics based model will improve
our ability to predict if a specific motor is good or bad based on
conditions it has experienced. Topics of particular interest are the
connection between polymer morphology\/cure with mechanical properties,
and cumulative damage including the potential for self-healing, possibly
 by competing chemical mechanisms [2]. Models developed in this area
have the potential to significantly improve our design and analysis
capabilities; the PLI in particular is thought to be one of the largest
sources of error in structural analyses. The models would also enable
the long-desired capability to design an SRM propellant system a priori
for a specific application. The proposed model should be computationally
 tractable on an engineering workstation or small cluster.
Supercomputers are not practical, as these models are intended for
frequent use in the design and structural\/health analysis of SRMs. The
overarching goal is to reduce uncertainties by a minimum of 10% in
modeling the propellant and\/or PLI leading to higher confidence in the
reliability of the SRM fleet. Innovative solutions that can focus on
high impact parameters to reduce uncertainty are highly sought-after.
Solutions should have a strong backing in: the fundamental material
physics and chemistry in addition to adherence to engineering
principles; previous research and development; scientific literature;
and cost-benefit analysis. The successful proposed Phase I will develop
the necessary theoretical framework for a SRM propellant model
illustrating that all parameters have a physical basis. Additionally the
 phase I should address the computer requirements for the model to be
computationally tractable, and should estimate the anticipated accuracy.
 The proposed solution shall be affordable and usable. Usability shall
take into account operability, sustainability, supportability,
interoperability, modularity, and reliability. The proposed system
should leverage standards-based communication and open-source software
wherever possible. Partnership(s) with a current Department of Defense
prime contractor(s) is highly desired, such a relationship would aid in
the refinement and implementation of the proposed model into existing
SRM analysis codes. The Phase II will include programming and
implementation of the theoretical framework on the proposed computer
system.  It will also include a validation and verification effort based
 upon available scientific literature. Due to the ubiquitous usage of
polymeric materials and the strong grounding in physics these models
should lend themselves to modification for a myriad of relevant
commercial usages, e.g. polymer manufacturing, fatigue of plastic
structures, etc.      PHASE I:  Develop a theoretical framework for
physics-based models for SRM propellant and\/or PLI. Illustrate the
potential benefits. Determine required computational resources and how
the code would interface with common commercially available structural
analysis software.      PHASE II:  Program theoretical framework on
proposed computer system ensure it is able to interface with structural
analysis software. Verify and validate the developed model using
relevant data from scientific literature.  Illustrate expected benefits
and average runtime. Demonstrate computer model to customer and deliver
software code along with a user's manual.      PHASE III DUAL USE

missiles and space launch applications, supporting the design and
analysis of SRMs. Commercial application: Manufacturing of polymers,
structural analysis of polymeric materials, potential to extend models

Software",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To develop new analysis tools and
techniques for safety verification and validation of software embedded
in or controlling strategic systems.       DESCRIPTION:  Software
controlling U.S. nuclear weapons must have the highest possible
assurance of safety and integrity.  The essence of nuclear safety
certification is an intensive review, verification, and validation of
developed software, starting with requirements and ending with
integration and regression testing (new software is generally integrated
 into an existing code base). As the nuclear community, including ICBM
Minuteman III, military nuclear weapon systems, DOE, Sandia and other
government\/military organizations with nuclear critical software
applications, continues to evolve, innovations in processes\/tools used
for mission safety testing are needed to prevent threats from malicious
code that could cause unintended nuclear consequences. Standard
processes and tools to assure the correctness, safety, and integrity of
such software are needed to maintain the highest level of safety.
State-of-the-Art Description - Currently, each government nuclear
operational system uses separate processes\/tools for certifying nuclear
 critical software applications before fielding. For instance, the ICBM
Program Independent Verification &amp; Validation (IV &amp; V) efforts
are governed in accordance with Air Force Manuals (AFMAN) 91-119 and
91-118; however, these publications are not used by the DOE. Each
government (DOE, SNL) and military (Navy) organization with nuclear
safety requirements uses similar but separate IV &amp; V
processes\/tools when certifying nuclear critical software applications.
      This SBIR proposes an innovative approach to standardize the
processes\/tools used to perform mission safety testing of nuclear
critical software applications. The SBIR proposal goal includes
collaboration between DOE\/government\/military organizations in order
to benefit from standard V &amp; V processes and tools.  The SBIR will
be used to standardize process\/tools innovations that account for
modern command\/control\/communication\/computers across a network that
is potentially vulnerable to cyber-attack due to modern
software-processing architectures. The SBIR also provides for innovative
 approaches to perform verification &amp; validation of complex code
development tools, such as compilers, before being used to develop
operational nuclear critical software applications. SBIR processes and
tools developed for software testing can also be used to standardize,
improve and share testing methods among all government\/military
software V &amp; V testing organizations outside of the nuclear
community.      Standardized tools used for nuclear weapons software
surety certification testing shall consist of static and dynamic
analyzers, CPU simulators, and binary file comparisons, and
configuration management. Testing processes will be defined to perform
both nominal and off-nominal conditions during execution of the software
 application. Static source code analyzers will be used to search for
malicious code and logic coding errors. Runtime simulator tools will be
used simulate operational environments and software application response
 to incorrect or malicious data inputs.      The tools and techniques
developed under this research should provide the following capabilities:
   1. Tracing from high-level requirements statements (called"Nuclear
Safety objectives") to lower-level requirements (called"Nuclear Safety
requirements"), detailed requirements, and into the implementation. Such
 traceability must be bidirectional and accommodate changes in a manner
which enables complete control, and retrospective analyses.  2. Complete
 structural analysis of code including ability to identify the setting
and using of all program variables, as well as persistently stored
values, tracing of execution paths, and development of test cases to
trigger execution of specific code paths.   3. Testing tools to achieve
complete branch and condition coverage.   4. Static analysis to check
for both conformance with secure coding standards and the presence of
malicious code.   5. Regression testing tools.   6. Dynamic analysis
tools including simulation of a VAX and a MIL STD 1750A microprocessor
with the ability to set watch points and breakpoints.   7. Formal
verification tools for both temporal and non-temporal analysis. This
includes the ability to show the translation (even if performed
manually) between natural language requirements and formally stated
requirements. 8. Other analysis techniques offered by proposers for the
purposes of assuring integrity and safety.   9. Verification,
validation, and testing management tools to assist in automation of the
Nuclear Safety Cross Check Analysis (NSCCA) process.      Proposals that
 describe solutions utilizing existing tools, or new tools, or both, to
achieve these capabilities in a single integrated framework are
encouraged. Proposals that include demonstrating the tool sets using
representative example systems with source code in Ada, C, or FORTRAN
(5-10 KSLOC) are particularly encouraged. Items 3 through 27 in the
attached reference list are examples of the state of the art of high
integrity and safety critical software development in the following
areas: Standards, requirements formulation (including decomposition and
tracing to the design), formal methods, behavioral modeling and model
checking, code generation, model checking, architectural design
languages, integrated environments spanning the development process from
 model based design through code generation, static analyzers, software
test automation (including model-based testing for automated test case
generation and test drivers for regression testing). These are
representative and by no means intended to limit the proposed approach.
     PHASE I:  Demonstrate the feasibility of a methodology and
associated tools to NSCCA verification.      PHASE II:  Full development
 (and testing) of the tools and demonstrate the methodology proposed on
realistic representative test cases.      PHASE III DUAL USE

DESCRIPTION:  Programmable Logic Devices, such as FPGAs and ASICs,
controlling U.S. nuclear weapons must have the highest possible
assurance of safety and integrity. Top-level safety requirements, called
 Nuclear Safety Objectives (NSOs), for such devices are set forth in two
 publications, AFMAN 91-118 and 91-119 (see references). Additional
specific functional and non-functional requirements are developed for
the specific devices at the start of the development. A specialized
process must be used for intensive verification of system safety against
 these and other derived requirements.      Examples of activities under
 this process include:     As ASICs and FPGAs grow increasingly complex;
 the nuclear surety certification process must innovate to provide
modernized processes and tools and to assure their correctness, safety,
and integrity to maintain the highest level of safety.       The RTCA DO
 254 standard (see references) developed for complex programmable logic
devices in avionics applications has also been used in other
applications and is an industry and certification authority accepted
approach for assuring conformance with safety requirements. For nuclear
weapons applications, the anticipated assurance level would be System
Level A. The objective of this research is to define a high assurance
process and associated tool set to provide this assurance.     The
specific goals include:     1. A gap analysis of the RTCA DO 254
standard against AFMAN 91-118, 91-119, AFI 91-101 requirements and
recommendations for changes (if any).   2. Definition of a specific set
of process objectives and verification criteria for device assurance.
3. Identification of specific tools or definition of methods to

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate an
algorithm-based scheme that improves navigation accuracy and
responsiveness of inertial-based navigation systems.       DESCRIPTION:
 The U.S. Air Force would like to explore more accurate and more robust
navigation capabilities for strategic systems. The strategic system is
heavily dependent on the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for strategic
system navigation since there is limited or no external aiding. Whereas
the Navy"s SLBM uses a star tracker to aid its inertial navigation
system, the Air Force ICBM mission relies entirely on autonomous
inertial navigation. The Air Force would like to explore improving
accuracy without having to implement an external aiding scheme to the
ICBM navigation, guidance and control system. Since computing power has
drastically increased over the past decades, the Air Force is interested
 in complimenting strategic grade inertial sensors with advanced
navigation algorithms to improve performance during flight. With the
exclusion of external aiding, the current and future hardware must have a
 complimentary suite of navigation algorithms to ensure the strategic
vehicle will meet the desired terminal conditions.     The Air Force is
interested in algorithmic solutions that improve the capability of
existing inertial measurement units and inertial instruments while
taking advantage of modern computing capability. Such a capability would
 be robust, accurate, low to moderate bandwidth, novel, and based upon
dynamic constraints, statistical estimations or other non-heuristic
schemes. It would increase accuracy and responsiveness for both the
Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) and CM systems.
Commercialization potential: DoD applications include the ICBM network
and CM systems. Commercial applications include any commercial device
that has an IMU where a more accurate navigation ability is desired.
  PHASE I:  Develop algorithms for an IMU-based navigation system that
addresses nonlinear, non-Gaussian error terms encountered during system
flight. Describe the trade-offs, and develop concepts of operations for
different alternatives developed. Prepare a report on the findings and
develop a plan to demonstrate the navigation algorithms in a relevant
simulation environment.      PHASE II:  Develop a demonstration of the
algorithms using realistic IMU models, demonstrating the ability of the
algorithms to accurately navigate an ICBM or CM (without updates) to
within a prescribed set of targeting conditions. Evaluate the
feasibility of transitioning these capabilities into flight capable
hardware, including integration into different missile systems.
PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This technology, if realized, would be
of obvious immediate benefit to both DoD and commercial IMU users
operating in a GPS-denied environment, such as buildings.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a power efficient, high
speed, radiation hardened memory device suitable for long term space
missions by using carbon nanotubes (CNT) or other innovative materials
and processes, (e.g.graphene), processes (3-D), &amp; architectures
(memristive).       DESCRIPTION:  In order to meet projected growth in
broadband military satellite communications, future generations of
payloads will be required to process the waveform at a significantly
higher rate. Unacceptably long memory cycle times can diminish the
performance of payload front-end processing by adding undesirable time
lags and leading to poor overall payload performance. To address this
concern, the Air Force seeks a new generation of radiation hardened
cache memory devices capable of allowing the central processing unit
(CPU) to operate with minimum memory cycle time by avoiding the
introduction of wait states. Before the next generation cache memory is
viable for insertion into a space mission, the materials and\/or
fabrication process must be proven reliable, affordable, and of a
density and performance that makes the memory component attractive as an
 alternative to the current generation of space memory. In particular,
the cache memory device must be shown capable of meeting the timing
constraints of an emerging generation of space qualified general purpose
 and special purpose processors, while withstanding the full range of
natural and manmade threats encountered in a long term, geosynchronous
space environment.      The purpose of this topic is to support research
 into innovative materials and\/or processes leading to a high speed
cache memory device. In order to better cope with the complex radiation
environments, spacecraft electronics are often implemented in
a"radiation-hardened"form that is three or more generations behind the
contemporary commercial state-of-the-art. Since spacecraft are
furthermore power-constrained, the effects of these performance
penalties are compounded by an inability to field enough of the slower
components to mitigate this gap. Component selections are limited,
especially for specialty memories, which stand-alone cache (e.g.,"level
2"or"L2") are considered to be. Despite the compelling benefits that
effective cache architectures can provide to general- purpose
computation, much less attention is paid in developing these options as
in developing the processor or FPGA components that might take advantage
 of them.     In this topic, we seek creative innovations that will give
 us better options for larger, lower-power, and higher-performance
(measured in reduced average access delays from processors) memory
components that can either augment a traditional memory hierarchy or
effectively collapse it (for example, by having a L2 cache large enough
to fit most problems of interest without having cache miss events). The
answer need not be confined to a traditional component solution, but can
 involve new interpretations of hybrid memory, stacked components (for
example, using through-silicon vias), even possibly three-dimensional
architectures that more effectively collocate processing resources with
larger, more efficient memory structures. It may be advantageous to
examine new architectural approaches, such as memristors, and materials,
 such as carbon nanotubes, phase-change materials, or grapheme. Along
with these notions of better memory technologies, we must overlay the
considerable constraints of working in space. Before the next-generation
 cache memory is viable for insertion into a space mission, the
materials and\/or fabrication process must be proven reliable,
affordable, and of a density and performance that makes the memory
component attractive as an alternative to the current generation of
space memory. In particular, the cache memory device must be shown
capable of meeting the timing constraints of an emerging generation of
space-qualified general purpose and special purpose processors, while
withstanding the full range of natural and manmade threats encountered
in a long-term, geosynchronous space environment. And of course, the
cost of modern microelectronics fabrication provides a challenge as
great as most of the other technical barriers.      Example goals

Advanced Reduced Instruction Set Computer suitable for use in long-term

becomes more broadly distributed across subsystems, there will likely be
 an increased need for a new generation of smaller (relative to general
purpose processors), more power efficient, radiation-hardened
microprocessors of reduced complexity to meet a broad range of payload
processing functions such as antenna controllers. Advanced
architectures, such as the Advanced RISC (Reduced Instruction Set
Computer) Machines (ARMs), are ideal candidates for distributed space
processing. For example, ARMs are typically designed for: power
efficiency, small circuit board footprint, limited instruction set
(which eases the programmer"s learning curve), and a relatively small
gate count (which reduces hardware complexity and improves reliability).
 In addition, the extensive commercial use of ARMs has led to a broad
assortment of advanced development and debugging tools and the extensive
 commercial legacy providing failure data to help instill confidence for
 space mission assurance. The purpose of this topic is to develop a
32-bit, radiation-hardened, space-qualifiable ARM processor that is
suitable for long-term space missions.  Research under this topic should
 strive to maintain compatibility with commercial ARM processors to
leverage existing software development support, including debugging
tools. ARM prototypes developed under this research should also strive
to include a full complement of built-in features, including interrupt
controller, optimized gate count, power-saving mode, debug capability,
32-bit word length, and fully deterministic timing behavior. Additional
goals include immunity to destructive latchup, total ionizing dose
tolerance to 1Mrad (Si), Single Event Effect (SEE) immunity to 60 MeV,
operating temperature range from -40 degrees  C to +80 degrees  C, and
component reliability consistent with 15-year on-orbit satellite mission

GPS receiver, develop a power management strategy which is implemented
with an intelligent embedded software monitor\/control application to
balance power consumption against receiver performance.
DESCRIPTION:  Modernized military Global Positioning System (GPS)
receivers continue to improve in capability, but the demand for
increased battery life remains a constant challenge. GPS receivers are
developed using application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) devices
that are fabricated in advanced submicron fabrication processes. They
efficiently integrate multiple microprocessor cores, crypto engines and
large acquisition circuits to meet size and power requirements. However,
 the newer semiconductor processes are now dominated by static power
dissipation due to transistor leakage. A common approach is to reduce
the power by reducing the position accuracy through various power-down,
duty cycle tradeoffs in tracking and acquisition, but the challenge is
to find the right mix between power and accuracy to meet the
requirements for a given application (e.g., munitions, personnel
location and time delivery). Also, military receivers can receive both
civil and encrypted codes. There may be time windows where the military
codes are not needed and performance modes could be adapted to the
exposed RF environments. The objective is to develop an application
which implements an intelligent power management strategy and suite of
algorithms which trades between power and predictable performance
behavior for any receiver. The application should reduce the power
required to track encrypted military signals by 50%--typical power
consumption for state-of-the-art military receivers is below 1.2W during
 tracking using 90nm technology.     Research GPS receiver power
management techniques which allow for specific optimizations based on
various mission scenarios and use cases. The study should define the use
 cases and define metrics which could be used to measure power and
performance with degradation in mission effectiveness. These metrics
should relate to receiver performance tradeoffs of critical requirements
 such as accuracy, Time To First Fix (TTFF), Anti-Spoof, Anti-Jam, as
well as military exclusivity. The study should survey and suggest
different hardware\/software architectures and algorithms that could be
implemented to reduce power by design optimization, as well as pulling
back on receiver performance, but still maintain mission effectiveness.
The study should look to combine these techniques into an application
which takes a holistic approach, accounting for mission-specific
requirements and use cases while leveraging related software and
hardware power optimizations which are common for battery operated
products. In addition, the application should have awareness of and
leverage on-chip power management enablers, such as power islands, back
bias and clock gating.       PHASE I:  Research GPS receiver power
management techniques which allow for specific optimizations based on

military exclusivity.       PHASE II:  Phase II will focus on the
simulation, implementation, and benchmarking of the techniques proposed
during Phase I. Demonstrate techniques at the architecture and
algorithmic level using simulations in high-level languages. Implement
the techniques as electronic circuits and software in a suitable
hardware-description language using constructs and resources independent
 of technology. Build prototypes.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop an accurate and secure GPS
time-aiding service that considers the time uncertainty from universal
time (UTC) of existing commercial and tactical wireless infrastructure.
       DESCRIPTION:  There are several methods to obtain time through
commercial and tactical communication infrastructures; however, the
level of trust and accuracy of these mechanisms limit their usefulness
for military missions. Investigate alternatives for delivering secured
time with highest accuracy to military GPS in tactical environments
which leverages existing commercial or military communication
infrastructure.      Applications that require synchronization often
depend on GPS receivers to provide a source of accurate time. However,
there are many situations when time is needed by the GPS receiver itself
 to reduce the Time-to-First-Fix (TTFF), e.g., when the GPS service is
denied due to RF interference. For military receivers, providing
coordinated universal time (UTC) between microsecond to millisecond
accuracy provides anti-jam robustness by enabling direct acquisition of
the military encrypted signals. Given that time is often provided over
commercial wireless and tactical wireless communication networks, it is
assumed military GPS receivers could be better integrated to leverage
this as a"time-aiding"service. The challenge is to identify the various
impacts to time transfer accuracy due to inherent limitations of a
particular communication waveform, network deployment and equipment
design (e.g., latency, clock jitter, protocols, software scheduling,
etc.). In addition, for a GPS time-aiding service to be robust for
military or public safety applications, authentication mechanisms would

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a compact multi-processor
system to support observation-based Cubesat payloads including single
sensor and\/or multi-sensor capability.       DESCRIPTION:  CubeSats,
small modular satellite platforms that range from 1U to 3U size, are
becoming highly regarded by both commercial and military organizations
that are exploring their use for various applications from surveillance
to communication to research missions. Standards-based satellite buses
and deployment mechanisms such as the CubeSat and Poly Pico-satellite
Orbital Deployer (P-POD) have driven expansion and technology
development forward. Small satellites have proven to be very adept at
focused tasks and require much lower capital expenditure and development
 time for both payload and launch tasks in contrast to expensive legacy
monolith satellites and their costly launch requirements. Though the
cost and development times associated with cubesats are much lower than
conventional satellites, their size, weight, and power-constraint
(SWaP-C) demands are much more stringent, particularly with regard to
onboard processing. This poses a challenge since many of the missions
envisaged for small spacecraft involve autonomous surveillance and
situational awareness that requires monitoring and fusing widely
disparate sensor data streams, as well as performing health monitoring
and housekeeping which can tax commonly available embedded processors.
While FPGAs are effective for some applications, the development and
validation time for a given design can be considerable. Instead, a
technology that shows considerable promise in this arena are embedded
heterogeneous processor arrays consisting of dozens of identical
processors. Such designs are better suited to graceful degradation in
the face of radiation damage and also recover better from defective
instructions and programming. In addition, such designs have remarkably
scalable power consumption given their ability to shut down individual
processors selectively or reallocate processors to perform load
balancing. While General Purpose Graphical Processing Unit (GPGPU)
approaches are the most widespread manifestations of this technology, an
 increasing number of mobile and embedded systems are proliferating.
 This solicitation seeks to develop processing subsystems based on COTS
multiprocessor array systems which are capable of performing
multi-parametric fusion, orbital propagation, and sensor housekeeping in
 a cubesat environment. It can be estimated that two thirds of a 3U
CubeSat SWaP will be used for power management, attitude control,
communications and other basic spacecraft functions. Therefore, the
processor array should fit within a small percentage of a 1U design and
use a small percentage of the allowed 1.33 kg mass. It should have the
capability to survive the LEO space environment for at least two years
with a goal of three, operate with significant power constraints with a
very low duty cycle or instantaneous power, and have a deep sleep cycle
which can be awakened by a significant event of interest and which does
not require continuous sensor polling.        PHASE I:  Develop a novel
multi-processor design for CubeSats to support AF space surveillance
missions using multiple sensors for space, ground or ocean observation.
Tasks could include developing the technology design, predicting sensor
performance w\/ the processor array using a simulation or other tools,
estimating the mass, volume &amp; power requirements, &amp; presenting
methods to mitigate power consumption.      PHASE II:  Build a prototype
 processor array and test it in a representative environment.
Optimize the power usage design.    Demonstrate payload operation in a
space setting such as thermal vacuum.    Evaluate operation in a space
radiation environment.   Evaluate measured performance characteristics
versus expectations and make design adjustments as necessary to enable
full sensor operation.        PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Focus on
integrating the technology into potential DoD (or Air Force) CubeSat

     DESCRIPTION:  IS-GPS-250A (1) is an interface specification for an
External Augmentation System, also known as a pseudolite (2), that
provides a terrestrial source of signals for position, navigation and
timing (PNT) purposes. These signals are currently defined to have the
same modulation as P(Y)-code but with differing signal structure to
facilitate simultaneous reception of both satellite and EAS signals.
  In the presence of BFEA signals, any signal with P(Y)-code modulation
will be significantly degraded, preventing reliable acquisition and
tracking. Since IS- GPS-250A is developed on a P(Y)-code modulation, it
is spectrally incompatible with BFEA.     The objective of this study is
 to investigate alternative signal modulations that would be spectrally
compatible with BFEA and with existing M-Code signals. Since IS-GPS-250A
 is currently being implemented in MGUE (3), the purpose of this study
is to examine a modulation within the signal structure defined in
IS-GPS-250A that is complementary to existing M-Code signal processing
techniques.     The study should examine the impact to M-Code signal

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop technologies for
spacecraft\/space lift that provide
game-changing"responsiveness"(ability to implement the same missions
much faster and lower cost with adequate reliability and comparable
capability thresholds\/environmental constraints).       DESCRIPTION:
The DoD is actively pursuing the capability to create and field a space
mission within days (even hours) of a battlefield commander's
notification. Achieving this capability for real-world missions is
essential to the disruptive vision of the Operationally Responsive Space
 (ORS) Office. We believe implementing"big"missions to be done
on"small"satellites is a game-changing approach for responsiveness,
since smaller platforms (i.e., spacecraft) are easier to store,
integrate, and launch. For this, technologies are the key. Can we find
ways to more effectively miniaturize satellite sub-systems, components,
and spacelift subsystems and components without compromising capability?
 Can we reduce the mass fraction of the spacecraft vehicle, so that more
 of it can be allocated to payloads? How can we pack more capable
payloads into smaller containers, perhaps to be deployed once in orbit?
Can we commoditize\/modularize these approaches, so that they can easily
 be duplicated or commoditized to support multiple mission needs? Can we
 find similar improvements to space lift components to improve mass
margin and launch capability?     We seek innovative concepts in
miniaturized systems such as: compact, reconfigurable bus and payload
components; modular\/open\/standardized payload configurations;
high-performance, compact sensors; flexible operations schemes; space
lift components and rapid integration; and improved on-ground and
on-orbit calibration\/check-out techniques. Can we break the perennial
cycle of building custom hardware, software, and interfaces that leads
to growing expense, schedule, and complexity?  The ORS Office will also
consider novel modification endeavors to existing
commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components to meet the needs of this
solicitation.     These technologies cover a broad range of the
technical spectrum. The technical objective is to reduce the size of
current satellites and space lift to one-half of their current mass and
volume without loss of capability. More specifically, this effort
involves development of innovative advances in structures, power
systems, microelectronics, wiring systems, propulsion, attitude
knowledge and control, space lift, and sensor systems that maintain
capability while reducing volume and mass for an ORS-class mission.
These systems should use standardized interfaces and integration schemes
 that make the launch of the satellite more responsive and operable for
missions and launch campaigns associated with the ORS-class missions.
  Contractors are strongly encouraged to work closely with the ORS
Office and its contractors, if necessary, to ensure technical efforts
are consistent with overall responsive satellite and space lift
development goals. Proposed concepts should strive for designs that can
eventually achieve a component fabrication and system integration time
of a few days for the widest range of relevant satellite and space lift
capability. In the near term, these techniques should cut integration
time and component\/mission costs in half.      PHASE I:  Work out a
convincing feasibility proof for the proposed concepts, ideally backed
by simulation models, designs, fabrication, and other demonstrations.
Establish the realism of these concepts and provide strong evidence that
 it will be possible to make meaningful progress in a Phase II program
to achieve a"gettable"product, as opposed to a"fragment"needing other
fragments to be useful.      PHASE II:  Design, fabricate, and test a
prototype-level concept that has functional specifications, interfaces,
and protocols consistent with the ORS Office"s mission configurations.
Ensure that the concept can work in the harsh environments of launch and
 space (e.g., shock, vibration, thermal cycling, radiation, spacecraft
charging, etc.).  Establish an integration strategy that will support
the assembly and checkout of a small satellite within a few days based
on the proposed concept.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Military:
 The ORS Office will have urgent use for this kind of technology.
Commercial: The Commercial space industry will also have the ability to
exploit such compact, capable systems for rapid deployment of
communications and other commercial space missions.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a low-cost
hardware\/software satellite testing system which can provide the
functionality of the TSTR electronics and the RBC TSTR core electronics.
 This system will be used to demonstrate satellite system compatibility
with the AFSCN.       DESCRIPTION:  The Transportable Space Test and
Evaluation Resource (TSTR) system provides deployable support for
factory and launch site satellite compatibility tests. The deployable
TSTR system, operated by the Mobile Range Flight (MRF) at the Space and
Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Development and Test Directorate, is
used to accomplish satellite Factory Compatibility Tests (FCTs) with the
 Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) prior to satellite
launches. Deploying and operating the TSTR for testing satellites for
AFSCN compatibility has become painfully unaffordable for many satellite
 programs. As budgets are reduced, satellite programs are seeking
lower-cost testing alternatives.      Developing a lower-cost testing
system that is standardized and functionally equivalent to the TSTR and
Remote Tracking Station Block Change (RBC) TSTR would greatly benefit
numerous satellite development programs. The new testing system will
verify and validate proper communication between the ground system and
the satellite system under test, while being largely automated and
sufficiently user friendly as to not require highly-specialized MRF
personnel for on-site oversight. This would provide a lower-cost AFSCN
compatibility testing capability for many satellite programs, while
freeing up overburdened MRF testing resources. SMC desires a deployable
TSTR-equivalent system that reduces the total system lifecycle
ownership, deployment, and operations cost by 50% or more over the
current standard.     With this test system, satellite programs could
perform AFSCN compatibility tests and troubleshooting without having the
 actual TSTR system and MRF personnel on site. TSTR systems could be
first augmented with, and perhaps later replaced by, the new test
system, reducing the unsustainable high costs associated with operating
and maintaining them. This test system will benefit all those who
utilize the AFSCN network for conducting space TT &amp; C or mission
data distribution.      PHASE I:  Perform analysis of AFSCN
compatibility testing requirements to determine the optimal low-cost
hardware and software capabilities necessary to perform ground system
functional testing that verifies compatibility between Satellite
Operation Centers (SOCs) via a simulated AFSCN Automated Remote Tracking
 Station (ARTS) and a RBC node represented by the TSTR and RBC TSTR
systems.      PHASE II:  Design and develop a prototype system that has
the necessary hardware components and AFSCN simulator software to
perform the required testing activities. Conduct a demonstration using
both the prototype simulator suite and TSTR systems to successfully
execute factory satellite-to-AFSCN compatibility test functions.
PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This system will reduce satellite
development risk by ensuring AFSCN compatibility during AI &amp; T,
reducing the number of issues discovered during pre-launch checkout.
Developing a largely software-based TSTR simulator will provide a much
lower cost and robust test capability.",

Mechanics, Ensemble, and Bayesian Forecasting Methods",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Modify, develop and apply automated,
 machine-based learning systems and algorithms to assimilate, classify
and identify solar eruptive activity and use the derived meta-data
signals to predict and forecast solar eruptions.        DESCRIPTION:
Solar eruptions (solar flares and coronal mass ejections) cause
disruptions to communication and navigation in DOD and civilian systems.
 This SBIR seek solutions to forecasting solar eruptions using data
modeling, from the perspectives of statistical mechanics, complexity,
ensemble forecasting and Bayesian forecasting methods. Current
consistent solar activity forecasts are issued once a day (24-hours),
and require"human-in-the-loop". This SBIR seeks efforts at automated
data-driven (no human in the loop) forecasts of 6-24 hour advance, which
 will be an improvement over current forecasts.  It will require
probabilistic predictions of future solar activity levels, greater than
50% confidence levels.      Consistent and reliable solar imaging data
is openly available from many sources. They include NASA"s Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and its Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; ~
12 layers) and Heliospheric Magnetic Imager (HMI ~ 3 layers) instrument,
 and other observatories\/instruments that produce continuous high
cadence solar imaging data. Hence it is now feasible to research and
develop data driven models for supporting near-real-time advanced
forecasting of solar activity. Such models can include auto-regressive
forecasting models, machine learning, statistical physics data models
(such as fluctuation dissipation theorem), complexity analysis, Bayesian
 learning systems, support vector machines, neural networks,
multivariate discriminant analysis and genetic algorithms. Such
algorithms have been applied to the forecasting of terrestrial weather.
     A key objective of this work will the development of a verifiable
set of test algorithms on independent test and training data sets based
on a variety of eruptive and non-eruptive active region measurements. It
 will require algorithms to (a) automatically (no human in the loop)
ingest solar imaging and non-imaging data from open sources to
characterize current state of solar activity from various solar regions;
 (b) demonstrating meta-data relevant to characteristics of eruptive
solar activity prior to eruptions'(c) developing Bayesian, statistical
and\/or machine-learning models specifically ingesting the relevant
meta-data developed in item b to show continuous eruptive probabilities
for application into 6-hour, 12-hour and 24-hour predictions; and (d)
demonstrate the use of the data in real-time probabilistic prediction by
 using training and test cases. The references below point to potential
algorithms that have been attempted.      Adapting Bayseian and related
statistical algorithms tested and used in domains such as terrestrial
numerical weather forecasting, Internet data mining and prediction
tools, decision theory, or other statistical applications should be
considered.     AFRL\/RV plays a key role in understanding and
predicting solar drivers of space weather, whose signals show
significant impact on DoD communications and navigation systems and on
its space assets. Providing impending\/imminent status and an advance
warning of the solar electromagnetic, particle and mass radiation on
near-Earth and terrestrial systems, by a rapid ingestion and analysis of
 solar data, is vital to this process.      PHASE I:  Develop &amp;
apply machine based learning systems to data-mine and rapidly extract
meta-data specifying eruptive signals to classify eruptive solar
activity. Develop verifiable forecast algorithms (no human in loop),
using multi-spectral and near-simultaneous imaging data from SDO and
other observatories. Demonstrate applications of algorithm robustness
using limited training and test data.      PHASE II:  Refine concept
from Phase I and demonstrate ensemble forecasting from a variety of data
 sources and applied on a few thousand independent training and test
cases. Apply to probabilistic forecasting of near-real-time data, for
short-term (minutes), mid-term (hours",

        "topic_name": "Adaptive antenna structures",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop antenna structure(s) or
related items, capable of reducing radio frequency interference (RFI)
susceptibility in RF-congested environments by controlling radiated and
received emissions.       DESCRIPTION:  The Air Force Satellite Control
Network (AFSCN) finds itself operating in regions of increasingly
congested Radio Frequency Interference (RFI). The advent of private and
commercial 4G use, ad hoc networks, and increasing usage of adjacent
bandwidths by these wireless device networks introduces more traffic
into the L\/S-bands, and threatens AFSCN stability. The advent of mobile
 data-enabled devices and mobile market expansion realizes unprecedented
 growth. Current projections call for a 15 times mobile-traffic increase
 by 2017 ("Traffic and Market Report June 2012", Ericsson). These
projections will necessitate the adaptation of current AFSCN ground
sites to prevent threats of possible site closure, disruptions in AFSCN
coverage and service.      Adaptive Aperture would enable variable beam
width operations that can be dynamically optimized once signal reception
 has occurred, incorporating at least 10 db edge taper improvements over
 existing 13 meter antenna. Would mitigate RFI and close-in neighbor's
RFI to conduct satellite vehicle (SV) uplink activities via suppression
shaping technologies (e.g., active spectral tapering and materials and
controls technologies). The proposed solution space should provide
enhanced sidelobe suppression up to the order of 10 db for uplinks up to
 10kW CW.     To minimize cost and impact to current AFSCN sites,
proposals should be limited to technologies that can be adapted into
current 13-meter antennae (including subreflector, surfaces, legs,
etc.), or surrounding external structure(s), such as the radome. As the
antenna dish itself, and its related focusing elements and the radome
have direct pattern and spectral effects, solutions in the form of
structural or materials solutions are notionally feasible and
implementable. These could include frequency-selective surfaces (FSS) or
 novel metamaterial-type surfaces on controllable elements, e.g.,
radome, sub-reflector modifications are approaches to consider.
Constraints such as keeping losses low in the transmission bands and
reception bands (maintain baseline efficiencies) while effectively
reducing managing side-lobes is to be considered across the SGLS
(L-band) and USB (S-band) frequency bands.      As this call is not for
procurement of new antenna assets per se, it does indicate and opens
tradeoff with several technologies and techniques that can modify or add
 capability via hardware and software to existing AFSCN-fielded assets.
Some techniques, such as antenna nulling, for instance, may indicate
feedhorn modifications or replacements, or development of active surface
 focusing shaping in the receive hardware, or both via dichroic
structures.     Introduction of these technologies have the ability to
reduce search and acquisition time to resolve SV orbits during launch,
and space vehicle early-orbit ops. This can minimize spatial
interference with multiple close-in SV contacts that are also not
spectrally diverse. Also provides assured access to SVs in congested
environments where those SV spatial and frequency\/spectral assignments
and external incoming interferences, from both ground and space, compete
 or are hostile.     An optimal capability would dynamically reduce beam
 width upon satellite vehicle contact and also control and contain
spectrum (sidelobe management, dynamic gain, nulling). Enhanced
capability to suppress side-lobe and spillover to minimize possibility
of external RFI, and also reduce overall RF footprint is desired.
Proposal should not address new whole antenna structures, or discrete
arraying techniques.      Proposed solutions should be applicable to
in-place AFSCN ground-stations. Produce a plan for prototype, test, and
construction of a full-scale, or scaled application, for the antenna
and\/or radome structure. Show the potential or relative cost-benefit
analysis of each solution. Use of EM models such as HFSS, Ansoft, CST,
or other horn modelers, feed\/antenna structure simulators is
encouraged.     As applicable, demonstrate control\/tuning mechanisms
and show that antenna performance is not reduced in terms of loss, gain,
 efficiency, and show what additional investigations are required for
operational high power uplink environment, or due to any other
constraints that are determined in the course of solution validation.
    PHASE I:  Investigate approaches for modifying existing AFSCN
antenna structures to produce desired side-lobe suppression and
main-signal edge taper and control. Develop the baseline unmodified
antenna model and an upgraded model with simulated results (pattern,
spectrum) demonstrating accomplished objectives over the uplink and
downlink bandwidths of interest for SGLS and USB.      PHASE II:
Produce a prototype device and demonstrate capability in a laboratory
setting that can be validated with the Phase I models. The prototype
must be able to demonstrate relevant performance that indicates
sufficient side-lobe suppression and taper control, or other main-beam
enhancements can be achieved in a full-scale brassboard development.

enable operation or enhanced agility where RF congested. Commercial:

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate a liter
scale atomic clock with 1E-16 long term stability suitable for space
applications.       DESCRIPTION:  Compact precision atomic clocks (CPAC)
 and atomic frequency standards (AFS) with 1E-16 term stability are
capable of providing the timekeeping needs of future civilian and
military systems. A space qualified clock can significantly increase GPS
 position accuracy and\/or resilience to all users when installed on the
 GPS constellation, can increase position accuracy on space users with a
 poor view of the GPS constellation (e.g., vehicles at GEO), and can
increase security for communication satellites. CPAC will also be useful
 for future inertial navigation devices.      The increased accuracy
provided by the CPAC will also provide new tools for doing space-based
scientific research which is critical for developing the future
applications of a modern military.  Research into gravitation (possibly
gravity mapping), general relativity, and the fine structure constant
are some examples (see references).     A CPAC would have ground
applications as well because it could replace the hydrogen MASER as a
ground reference. GPS ground station master clocks are required to
maintain the constellation. Military R &amp; D facilities could use the
CPAC to test future timing devices. Commercial frequency standard
producers can use the CPAC to calibrate future commercial instruments.
These clocks have also been demonstrated for use as gravity detectors.
     Clocks at 1E-15 stability have been demonstrated at the liter size
scale, but new clocks in the last 5 years have moved to 1E-17 and
recently 1E-18 (see references). These new clocks have been demonstrated
 at tens of liter scales in a laboratory. This effort will be an
important next step in realizing these next generation timing devices in
 the compact foot print needed for this extra laboratory use.      The
reliance of the warfighter on precision GPS cannot be overstated. A
clock with the performance headroom in CPAC could significantly ease
manufacturing concerns for GPS. The performance headroom allows for the
easing of manufacturing tolerances required to meet GPS requirements and
 fulfill Space Command's Core Function Master Plan Priority #3.  Also,
the reduction of error loosens the reliance on external aiding and
synchronization, which increases the robustness of the overall GPS
system.     This effort is meant to focus on miniaturizing state of the
art ultra-precise atomic clocks, especially the physics package, with
some compromise on ultimate frequency stability to create a low size,
weight, power and cost, as well as increase the robustness such that
space compatible version of CPAC could be made.       PHASE I:  Research
 and design a compact precision atomic clock for space with 1E-16 long
term stability while maintain a final form factor under 5.5 liter with a
 goal under 1 liter.       PHASE II:  Develop a prototype of the Phase I
 design and demonstrate short term stability of 1E-14 per square root of
 sample time and 1E-16 frequency stability at one day time.       PHASE
III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Military: Compact atomic clocks could be
incorporated into future navigation satellites to enhance navigation
accuracy. Commercial: A derivative of the compact atomic clock could be
used by the commercial timing instrument producers.",

 NSA&amp;quot;s Key Management Infrastructure (KMI)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Research the impact that NSA"s new
Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) will have on military GPS user
equipment, key management operations and techniques that provide
seamless transfer of cryptography key material directly to military GPS
receivers.       DESCRIPTION:  Military GPS user equipment (UE)
receivers are physically and manually loaded with National Security
Agency (NSA) generated cryptographic key material on a periodic basis to
 facilitate receiver processing of the encrypted P(Y) code signal set.
This cryptograpic key material is currently electronically distributed
worldwide via the Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) system. EKMS
is a NSA-led program which generates and distributes electronic key
material for all U.S. government encryption systems whose keys are
loaded using standard fill devices, and manages the distribution of most
 of the NSA-produced key material.      EKMS is gradually being
completely replaced by a new system, NSA"s Key Management Infrastructure
 (KMI). KMI will provide a means for the secure ordering, generation,
production, distribution, management and auditing of nearly all
cryptographic products, to include all GPS UE key material worldwide.
  GPS UE has some very unique key management challenges due to widely
diverse receiver designs and a high amount of friendly foreign military
participation. Traditional NSA-sponsored key management capabilities
often do not take into account the kind of wide releasability and
international involvement that is needed to support the huge,
many-nation, GPS UE community. NSA"s new KMI program will be bringing
online a wide array of new features, capabilities, and also issues for
users of GPS key material over the next five years. Some of these new
features have the potential to significantly ease the key management and
 distribution burden for both U.S. military and friendly foreign
military GPS users, but will require operational concepts,
communications security (COMSEC) policy changes, and potentially
hardware\/software augmentation to be developed in order to take full
advantage of these advancements. The GPS military UE community is
falling behind on preparing for and socializing this major key
distribution change and is soliciting research to help identify
shortfalls and unaddressed issues associated with this upcoming
migration from EKMS to KMI over the next several years.     This SBIR
will investigate KMI features and evaluate them against current and
projected future GPS U.S. military and friendly international military
UE concept of operations (CONOPS) to identify pitfalls in order to
assure seamless GPS keying operations for the warfighter. It will
develop various operational use scenarios to highlight the benefits of
KMI specific to GPS receivers, and prepare presentations that can be
socialized to the larger military GPS UE community. It will identify
features that require integration with GPS receivers, and develop a set
of requirements that could be added to future GPS UE receiver contracts
to enable greater support of"direct to receiver"keying through KMI.
 PHASE I:  Investigate KMI features and evaluate them against current
and projected future GPS UE keying CONOPS to identify how the community
can best benefit from this migration and any associated pitfalls.
Develop operational use scenarios to highlight the benefits of KMI as it
 relates to military GPS receivers. Develop operational concepts that
leverage KMI to enable direct receiver keying.      PHASE II:  Develop
technical requirements and operational concepts that could be required
of future modernized GPS UE in order to take full advantage of the
capabilities of KMI. Identify special hardware and\/or software modules
necessary to leverage the full spectrum of KMI capabilities and generate
 technical descriptions and requirements for those modules. Develop
technical documents detailing a method to deliver key material that
could work with unmodified, modernized GPS user equipment devices.
  PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Build and demonstrate at least one
mechanism to upload key material directly from the KMI system into
modernized GPS user equipment. One of the mechanisms demonstrated must
be able to support all foreign partners authorized to use encrypted
military GPS receivers.",

(TIN) in support of Space Situational Assessment",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop algorithms to determine and
assess space system threats and anomalies. The ability to differentiate
anomalous conditions and to correctly assess man made threats and\/or
abnormal environment impacts is critical for future space systems.
 DESCRIPTION:  A critical need exists to be able to detect and
discriminate between environmental conditions, man-made threats, and
internal spacecraft anomalous conditions. In addition, a need exists to
determine the mission impacts of these scenarios and recommend and\/or
execute courses of action in order to mitigate these conditions. To
rapidly assess a threat to our space systems, algorithms are needed to
process a wide variety of information sources including catalog,
telemetry, and space environment data. Algorithms are needed that are
capable of turning raw data into usable information. These individual
data sources then need to be correlated to provide overall situational
assessment which in turn then needs to be acted upon. This topic should
take advantage of, and build on, years of research in level 0, 1, and 2
data fusion. For the purposes of this topic, level 0 fusion is defined
as detection on an event within a single information source, level 1 is
defined as the tracking of that event, and level 2 is defined as the
correlation of events across multiple information sources in order to
provide a more complete situational assessment. Accurate and reliable
level 2 fusion systems in the DoD are rare, but strategically important.
 As a result, it is important to leverage previous work on real data to
develop and extensively test level 2 data fusion capabilities for both
space operations and counterspace applications. A key to the ability to
correlate data is the need for an infrastructure that enables real-time
communication between software entities. One such technology that
provides that foundation is the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
Within the Space Sector of the Air Force, an infrastructure that
provides this capability is the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC)
Mission Systems (JMS) SOA. Proposers should consider how their proposed
solution would operate with the JMS architecture and proposals that
include integration and demonstration within JMS will be viewed
favorably. In support of JMS, the Space Vehicles Directorate of AFRL has
 developed a JMS testbed called the Advanced Research Collaborative and
Development Environment (ARCADE). Depending on the proposed approach,
the ARCADE testbed could be made available to proposers as a
demonstration platform.      PHASE I:  The focus of Phase I is to
develop and demonstrate a proof-of-concept TIN prototype system that
processes information sources such as those described above and provides
 appropriate responses. Performance assessment will include the
accuracy, timeliness and mission impact.      PHASE II:  Phase II will
build on the Phase I prototype to include a wider variety of historical
and real-time data sets.  Emphasis will be placed on the ability to
accurately characterize a situation. An emphasis will be placed on
demonstration within the JMS ARCADE testbed.      PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: The underlying technology to be developed focuses on
applying intelligent systems technologies to the problem of detecting
anomalous situations for satellites. Data fusion and validation tools
have applicability to numerous areas beyond the space domain including
the air and sea domains.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Investigate designs and possible
options for a PNT Flexible satellite for GPS to enhance position,
navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities, at a low cost.
DESCRIPTION:  GPS augmentation systems enhance GPS constellation
capabilities by providing additional PNT Flexible capabilities not
inherent to GPS. It is desirable to use augmentation systems to maintain
 a more robust GPS service, particularly in areas where service
interruptions are problematic, or better accuracy is needed.       While
 the GPS constellation provides good coverage worldwide, it is necessary
 to maintain the capability to provide that coverage during mission
critical times. This leads to the need to explore the feasibility of
developing an augmentation satellite at a significantly lower cost than
GPS satellites that is able to broadcast a signal set that can enhance
PNT capabilities and provide continuous GNSS coverage to the war
fighter.      In order to address this problem, possible avenues could
involve the exploration of using small satellites with limited payloads
to reduce cost and meet mission essential needs. While the satellites
may not be able to broadcast all signals simultaneously, it is more
important to provide support to those GPS signals that are weak in a
given location for any number of reasons. In other words, the
augmentation satellite will help overcome GPS coverage issues due to
terrain, spoofing, jamming, interference, etc., by broadcasting signals
at a higher power than the constellation is able to provide to a
specific geographic area.      At a minimum, the satellite should be
able to transmit M-Code without boost in the L1 frequency band. Ideally,
 the satellite will be capable of transmitting P(Y), C\/A, and M-Code
with or without boost in the L1 frequency band. It is not required to
transmit all signals simultaneously, that is, the satellite can utilize
adaptive partial or whole signal set availability. For example,
transmitting only P(Y) and C\/A codes at L1 may be necessary for one
location, but transmitting only M-Code at L1 may be needed for another
location. All transmissions should be at power levels consistent with
GPS core performance standards or better.      Proposals should clearly
indicate how the result of the effort would be shown to improve the GPS
system's capabilities through a test and validation plan. Testing and
validation of risk reduction components of the overall effort in Phase I
 is encouraged. Phase II efforts should include ensuring compatibility
with component interface descriptions supporting overall payload and
space vehicle reference designs as part of their commercialization
effort. Interface descriptions will be supplied to Phase I awardees
invited to propose for Phase II.      Offerors are encouraged to work
with PNT system prime contractors to help ensure applicability of their
efforts and begin work towards technology transition.      Offerors
should clearly indicate in their proposals what government furnished
property or information are required for effort success. Requests for
other-DoD contractor intellectual property will be rejected.      PHASE
I:  Efforts should concentrate on the development of the fundamental
concepts for augmented GPS system accuracy, availability, operational
continuity, or system integrity and plan to further develop this
technology in Phase II.      PHASE II:  The Phase II SBIR effort should
utilize the innovation developed in Phase I and develop a simulation or
architecture model to demonstrate the innovation. This should
demonstrate the potential of the augmentation satellite to meet emerging
 operational needs. Demonstration of the augmentation of GPS system
accuracy, availability, operational continuity, or system integrity must
 be validated.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Military
application: GPS space and ground control segment.  Commercial
application: Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS).  Commercialization of

observed solar phase angles or time. These signatures shall be used as
the primary source of information that permits characterization of a

space sensors that will timely respond to contested RF environments,
including radar interferences, personal 3G\/4G telecommunications, etc.
      DESCRIPTION:  Satellites are more vulnerable today to radio
frequency (RF) jammers and high power in space-band transmitters due to
availability of satellite operation information and low-cost RF
equipment. In particular, satellite communications are facing
increasingly more diverse physical, cyber, and natural threats from
terrestrial stationary and\/or mobile RF jammers that transmit RF

Thus, RF emitter detection and mitigation is essential for reliable
satellite operations via communications, positioning, navigation and
timing. As an effective proof-of-concept for space-based RF jamming
detection and mitigation, this topic seeks to bring system concepts and
software-hardware paradigms enabled by reconfigurable field-programmable
 gate arrays (FPGA) of smart antennas, RF emitter detection and
localization computation which are communicating with orbital
propagation simulations of a constellation of cubesat sensors running in
 NASA General Mission Analysis Tools (NASA GMAT) environments on a
personal computer through User Data Protocol (UDP)\/Internet Protocol
(IP).     Responding to this opportunity and its technical challenges,
low-cost solutions proposed should leverage from theoretical and
practical fronts of geolocation; software defined radios for
reconfigurable sampling rates, bandpass filtering, and intermediate
frequency selections as required by X\/Ku\/K\/Ka\/Q-bands, and flexible
FPGA for implementation of custom circuits of matrix-vector

10cm x 30cm cubesats together with multiple variables and parameters on
operational areas of responsibility, revisit rates, RF sensing swaths, a
 host carrier with deployment mechanisms required to enter and exit
waiting orbits for cubesat node separations, etc.; (ii) conceptual
designs for smart wideband antenna and onboard sweeping frequency
receivers to minimize FPGA resource and power requirements; (iii) low
complex methods to extract X\/Ku\/K\/Ka\/Q-band spectrum
characteristics, in addition of trade studies among Direction-of-Arrival

Frequency-Difference-of-Arrival (FDOA) assisted by earth surface
information maps, if appropriate; (iv) operational issues of time and
frequency synchronization of space-based transceivers; and (v) dynamic
cubesat sensor management for effective RF sensing distribution and

merits as mentioned in (i) through (v) should include a software defined
 library of smart antenna emulation, smart antenna calibration, RF
emitter alignment based on time markings and spectrum signatures as well
 as closed-loop performance evaluations of RF emitter detection and

Nitride-based (GaN) L-band Field Effect Transistor (FET) or a GaN-based
Solid State Power Amplifier (SSPA) for GPS applications to reduce the
cost of the GPS system through higher efficiency amplifiers.
DESCRIPTION:  Improvements in efficiency resulting in lower power
consumption and cost savings are required for future GPS L-band
amplifiers. This solicitation is broad-based covering component design,
and design architectures. Specifically sought are new and innovative
approaches and technologies that will increase performance of
space-based, high power L-band amplifiers. Radiation hardness and the
ability for the technology to be qualified for space applications are
crucial for successful proposals.     Any proposal submitted must first
focus on high-efficiency GaN HEMT design, then a GaN HEMT-based
amplifier design and development based on the optimized GaN HEMT. An
offeror may submit multiple proposals with unique approaches in either
area, but must lead to a high efficiency GaN HEMT-based SSPA.     A high
 efficiency GaN HEMT is needed for a solid-state L- band amplifier for
GPS applications. GaN HEMTs have matured for ground applications, and
have shown desirable characteristics for use in space applications;
however, limited continuous wave operation, space experience or test
data is available for them. Efforts for this topic should focus on GaN
HEMT radiation tolerance, efficiency and bandwidth for use in L-band
space amplifiers. This can be accomplished with development of
innovative GaN HEMT designs focused on optimization for efficiency,
radiation tolerance and bandwidth for L-band, space-based, GPS
applications.     It is desired that a GaN HEMT SSPA design have greater
 than 60% efficiency as a goal, and desired power output is 400W. The
SSPA needs to be compatible with the performance requirements of GPS L1
signals (see Reference 5 for technical specifications). Design efforts
should focus on a high performance, high power amplifier optimized for
power and efficiency. Efficiency for this amplifier should be specified
in terms of Power Added Efficiency (PAE).     Proposals should clearly
indicate how the result of the effort would be shown to improve the GPS
system's capabilities through a test and validation plan. Testing and
validation of risk reduction components of the overall effort in Phase I

 GaN FETs optimized for high power\/efficiency and use in space-based
L-band power amplifiers for GPS. Design should be radiation hardened,
and simulated to show desired operation and performance characteristics.
 Design and simulate the SSPA the GaN FETs will be used in and, if
possible, produce a working breadboard.      PHASE II:  The selected
company will team with a major contractor to produce working prototype
GaN FETs for component evaluation and SSPA brassboard for amplifier
evaluation, both including radiation tests. Phase II efforts should
include ensuring compatibility w\/Component Interface Descriptions (CID)
 supporting overall payload &amp; space vehicle reference designs as
part of their commercialization effort. CID will be supplied to Phase I
awardees invited to propose for Phase II.      PHASE III DUAL USE

Stable Oscillators",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate a liter
scale optical system to produce stable microwaves at 1E-14 per square
root time and support an atomic clock with 1E-16 long term frequency
stability suitable for space applications.       DESCRIPTION:  Compact
precision atomic clocks (CPAC) with 1E-16 long term stability are
capable of providing the timekeeping needs of future civilian and
military systems. A space-qualified clock can significantly increase GPS
 position accuracy and\/or resilience to all users when installed on the
 GPS constellation, can increase position accuracy on space users with a
 poor view of the GPS constellation (e.g., vehicles at GEO), and can
increase security for communication satellites.       The reliance of
the warfighter on precision GPS cannot be overstated. A clock with the
performance headroom in CPAC could significantly ease manufacturing
concerns for GPS. The performance headroom allows for the easing of
manufacturing tolerances required to meet GPS requirements and fulfill
Space Command's Core Function Master Plan Priority #3.  Also, the
reduction of error loosens the reliance on external aiding and
synchronization, which increases the robustness of the overall GPS
system.      The most stable atomic clocks use optical transitions in
atoms (see references). These systems require robust frequency combs and
 narrow line width lasers to take advantage of most promising atomic
systems. This effort will focus on integrating frequency combs with
narrow line with lasers, increasing their robustness, and decreasing
their size weight and power requirements. The goals are to create an
integrated frequency comb with narrow line width laser that is suitable
for working with a CPAC with frequency stability of 1E-14 per square
root of sample time and 1E-16 stability at one day. To that end, the
system should be on the scale of liters, should output a stable and
accessible microwave frequency between 1 MHz and 1 GHz, and should be
capable of frequency locking to an atomic system at the CW laser
wavelength used and be robust to temperature and mechanical instability
at the same time. The system should conceivably be made radiation
tolerant in a future effort.      The optical system described here can
also be used without an atomic reference as replacement for solid state
oscillators such as quartz or sapphire. The microwave output of this
system will exceed, on short time scales, microwave references used in
applications such as RADAR and communications and thus could improve
capability in those areas.         There are many potential avenues to
achieve these goals. There has been significant progress in developing
narrow line width lasers with stabilized optical cavities and producing
frequency combs with fiber laser based technologies and whispering
gallery mode resonators as examples (see references). Any approach is
acceptable, but should be justified as to how it meets the goals above.
       PHASE I:  Research and design a frequency comb integrated with a
CW narrow line width laser system suitable for locking to an atomic
optical transition of interest (examples like strontium, calcium, or
ytterbium). The system should be designed to meet the goals in the
description.       PHASE II:  Develop a prototype of the Phase I design
and demonstrate short-term stability of 1E-14 per square root of
sampling time microwave output and the ability to frequency lock the
optical system to an atomic system capable of supporting 1E-16 frequency
 stability at one day. Show that the prototype is robust to acoustic and
 temperature noise while frequency locked to an atomic system.
PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This optical system can be integrated
into a compact precision atomic clock. These optical systems produce
highly stable microwaves and could replace crystal oscillators in
applications such as RADAR and communications.",

and Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) Targeting",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop high power, efficient MWIR
illuminator to provide wide field-of-view illumination for hand-held,
small weapon-mounted, remotely piloted aircraft, gunship, and helicopter
 applications.        DESCRIPTION:  New technology is leading to MWIR
sensors that are becoming pervasive on Air Force platforms.
High-operating-temperature sensors are significantly lowering battery
consumption for coolers and moving MWIR sensors into ground tactical and
 hand-held applications. The increased resolution and recognition range
for smaller optics size, higher contrast scenes than long wave uncooled
imagery, and other operational considerations, make MWIR an appealing
imagery solution.      However, there is a need to enhance the power and
 cost efficiency of MWIR illuminator\/pointers for surveillance and
targeting applications to complement the current switch from LWIR to
MWIR for platforms and, particularly, to provide a path for hand-held
MWIR tactical systems.      To be effective at operating ranges from 100
 meters to over 3 kilometer, solid state illuminators are needed. For
SUAS and Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), ranges of up to 10 kilometers
are needed. Breakthroughs in MWIR Interband Cascade and Quantum Cascade
lasers diodes led by DARPA and others have yielded near-room temperature
 laser diodes that promise near-term solid state, 10-12 watt
illuminators for SUAS, hand held, and gunship operations.      Part of
the challenge is to provide low-speckle output noise in the image frame
without diffusers or other means that result in loss of a significant
fraction of the output power. Two discrete zoom options are also needed
to provide either a point source for identification to other sensors, or
 wide field of view for target illumination. Since many sensors are
filtered differently over the 3-5 micrometer band, multi-color solutions
 are desirable with user control of output band to insure compatibility
with ground targeting devices, SUAS, and targeting pod sensors.
Size, weight, power and turn-on time are critical. Batteries are a
valuable commodity on SUAS platforms and man-carried or weapon-mounted
applications. Hot standby in less than one minute is desirable with
continuous run times of up to 30 minutes and intermittent 30 seconds on 1
 minute off for up to 4 hours. The size goal for complete illuminator
with optics and batteries is the size of current NIR and SWIR
illuminators for weapon-mounted applications--3 inches long by 1 inch
wide by 2 inches tall. Designed to be mounted on weapon rails or in a
SUAS targeting gimbal.      Operational range equation must be
considered in such a design and investigation. Limited small optical
system size for both detector and illuminator drive the utility of the
requirement. Cost is a key component, with a 1000-unit quantity goal of
under $5,000 each. This drives innovation and efficiency to derive
useable and affordable technology.      PHASE I:  Investigate solid
state uncooled or minimally cooled MWIR illuminator solutions for
speckle-less pointing and targeting. Through critical experiment and
analysis, show for limited optics size that sensor technology range
equations show significant signal-to-noise improvement and target ID
range improvement over passive only.  Calculate system heat, power, and
battery life of proposed approach.      PHASE II:  Develop and
demonstrate compact weapon and RPA\/SUAS illuminator pointer with
integral MWIR zoom optics and band selection. Show power, waste heat and
 cooler power management consistent with operational consideration and
both ground and airborne uses in enclosed small gimbal packages. Show
producibility approach to lower user cost in quantities to desired
acquisition price point for long range ground-to-ground (100m to 3km)
and air-to-ground (1km to 10km) applications.      PHASE III DUAL USE

 hand-held laser marker\/designator",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop miniature laser
line-of-sight (LOS) optical stabilization device for hand-held laser
marking\/ designation applications that incorporates"see-spot"and target
 tracking capability.       DESCRIPTION:  As the size and weight of
laser targeting markers and rangefinders have decreased, numerous
hand-held (non-tripod) applications have been developed. Unfortunately,
these small systems are unstable and require improved line-of-sight
(LOS) stability to hold the laser spot on the target at long ranges and
to minimize laser jitter over and under the target. Eventual goal is
laser on-the-move.     Hand-held laser designators do not offer any
laser beam stabilization and often lack any imaging or target tracking
capabilities. Without stabilization, laser energy is smeared on the
target. For example, a 300 microradian divergence laser beam at 1 km
will be 30 cm in diameter. Any motion induced by the operator will cause
 the 30 cm spot to travel on the target. In a scenario where the spot
never leaves the target, but is also not stationary, a laser spot
tracker may not lock onto the target since the average energy is too
low.      Another scenario is where the spot"spills-over"the target due
to the large spot size relative to the target, and sometimes the lack of
 an integrated target tracker.  In this case, beam energy is completely
lost (or worse, placed on the wrong target!). Even with training, the
operator can induce LOS disturbances on the order of several degrees
during target designation, which can result in 30 feet of target
designation error at a range of 2 to 3 km.      Thus there is a need for
 a compact laser marking\/designation system capable of compensating for
 small disturbances induced by the operator. New technologies must be
developed that can stabilize laser beams (and possibly imaging LOS)
without the size and weight impacts of previous systems. Using modern
image sensors, such as a short-wave IR (SWIR) or a 1064 nm sensitive EO
camera, and a target tracker, the laser spot could be placed on a target
 and maintain pointing accuracy even with gross user motion. Since the
SWIR or Low Light EO targeting camera system is capable of seeing the
laser spot, the system could provide the user with a digital video feed
along with the laser spot position in the scene.      Recent
developments have been focused on small, hand-held target designators
the size of a 1-liter water bottle that have both direct-view optics,
electro-optical day\/night sights, and laser
pointer\/illuminator\/designator. Concepts that help stabilize these
compact multifunction instruments are needed. This may include an
all-aperture stabilization or laser beam stabilization with feedback,
and electronic stabilization of the other sensors. In any case, the LOS
needs to be indicated to the operator for the location of the IR
non-visible beam direction and target location.     Peak powers from
Q-switched lasers for military applications are exceedingly high. For
short pulses of 1 to 20 nanoseconds, peak powers of over a megawatt are
not unusual with average powers for some systems exceeding 10 watts.
Approaches must be compatible the intense powers and damage thresholds
represented in these types of laser systems.      PHASE I:  Investigate
innovations for stabilizing laser designator or rangefinder beams to
less than 50 microradians RMS. Perform experiments showing the ability
to reject low-frequency (0-10Hz) angular motions with displacements of
plus or minus 2 degs-all axes. Develop algorithms\/simulations
predicting LOS jitter performance. Develop design concepts for
miniaturization into a hand-held form factor.     PHASE II:  Develop a
hand-held sized prototype capable of integrating the see-spot imaging
system, laser designator, laser beam steering system, and video display.
 This prototype will demonstrate the feasibility of the system
recommended in Phase I.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Develop,

      DESCRIPTION:  Ubiquitous radio frequency (RF) and electromagnetic
radiation (EMR) usage is an important characteristic of modern military.
 While EMR offers many benefits, there are disadvantages associated with

take place when an explosive is exposed to EMR needs to be studied,

Inertial Instrument",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a compact, low profile, wide
 field-of-view day\/night stellar inertial technology for use in severe
weapon environments (vibration, thermal, etc.).       DESCRIPTION:  A
solution is needed for weapon and long-range platform operations with
minimal reliance on GPS, or preferably without any GPS. A precision
navigation solution that operates with minimal reliance on GPS, or
preferably without any GPS, is needed for airborne platforms as well as
air launched weapons. One potential solution is a stellar inertial
navigation sensor consisting of a star tracker coupled to an inertial
measurement unit (IMU). However, currently available stellar inertial
sensors operating without GPS augmentation are not capable of providing
GPS-quality accuracies. One reason for this is the error in the estimate
 of the orientation of the horizon plane, and hence the local vertical
vector. Each microradian error in the local vertical translates to about
 six meters of error for Earth coordinate (lat\/long) estimates. Sensors
 that directly observe or measure the local vertical accurately on a
moving vibrating airborne platform can greatly increase accuracy.
Another problem with the present-day stellar inertial sensors is the
narrow field of view of the star tracker. A wide field-of-view star
tracker would reduce errors due to platform movements and vibrations.
   Proposals should describe a breadboard-level inertial navigation
system (INS) coupled to other sensors, such as star trackers, to provide
 a complete non-GPS navigation solution. Accuracy, size, weight and
power (SWaP) estimates for near-term prototypes should be provided and
fully justified.      The need is for a day\/night wide field-of-view
WFOV Strap Down Star Tracker for very high speed missile and long range
weapon applications with secondary applications to remote piloted
aircraft (RPA) and ground applications for North Finding. The location
of a sensor for advanced high speed missiles and platforms is frequently
 non optimal and requires a small footprint. The sensor must be strap
down without mechanical gimbal or mirrors and have a large FOV.
Approaches to address severe vibration and heat must be self-normalizing
 without in situ calibration or more than 30 seconds of initialization.
The technology should operate day or night with thin cloud obscuration
from 1,000 feet to 100,000-foot and higher altitudes. The approach
should not be dependent on collocation or hard mounting to the IMU. A
thin package for body mounting is needed to lack of depth and volume in
the most probable mounting location for best view of objects.
Atmospheric effects of turbulence and refraction as a function of
altitude and novel approaches to derive down vector without magnetic
gradiometers must be addressed. To provide additional space object
versus star discrimination with severe vibration, a high speed sensor is
 anticipated for operation to derive angle rates as well as absolute
position independently.      Address dual use of the technology for
AFSOC ground targeting sensors, RPA platforms, and fixed wing fighter
and bomber aircraft.      It is envisioned a Phase II limited flight
demonstration joint with the Air Force Test Pilot School, Naval Post
Graduate School, or University or Prime Contractor is a key desirement
to establish transition readiness.       PHASE I:  Design a navigation
sensor that can provide GPS comparable accuracy without any GPS.
Simulate multiple flight trajectories and estimate accuracy using high
fidelity models that take into consideration weather, clouds, and other
environmental conditions, platform movement, rotation, and vibration.
The design should be mature at the end of the Phase I effort with lab
demo of critical elements.       PHASE II:  Develop and integrate
component technologies, interfaces, and software necessary to
demonstrate a prototype of the navigation sensor in the laboratory and
outdoors - preferably at low elevation and at high elevation. A flight
test ready prototype at the end of the Phase II effort is highly
desirable. Develop an ICD and transition plan and coordinate with Air
Force platform programs and DoD Inertial Systems prime contractors for
rapid technology insertion.       PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:
Develop and transition a deployable navigation sensor for use in

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop advanced miniaturized
angular rate sensors (Gyros) to address military weapons environment and
 need to improve inertial measurement unit accuracy to very low drift
strategic grade in a tactical weapon sized inertial package.
DESCRIPTION:  Very little investment in precision inertial measurement
unit (IMU) technologies for tactical weapons has been made in recent
years due to reliance on GPS and other radio navigation technologies.
The goal of this research is to address gaps in very high performance
angular rate sensors to improve tactical IMUs to strategic grade for
long-range weapons guidance without GPS.      A good form factor to
consider is the Honeywell HG1700 fiber laser gyro IMU. It provides
reasonable performance under a wide range of operation when disciplined
with periodic GPS inputs. The drift rates of the fiber laser and
accelerometer errors cause navigation errors over longer flight times
for long range weapon and RPA platforms. Sixty seconds of flight time
without GPS results in meters of error. Several hours can result in
kilometers of error. Improvements to existing angular rate sensors are
needed to improve long term guidance without GPS update at an affordable
 cost.      A small IMU footprint is needed for weapons IMU (i.e.,
performance of a Honeywell HG9900 or Northrop Grumman LN250 in a
Honeywell HG1700 form factor). The IMUs are typically mounted at the
rear of a weapon and can experience severe vibration and heat. To
minimize impact to existing weapon load out and form factor, the goal is
 to fit into existing IMU packages with a rate sensor goal footprint or
10 cubic inches or better for a Tri-Axial rate sensor package with
integrated electronics. This area also includes the support

technologies that can provide for miniaturization, integration, and
weapons environment operation of atomic interferometric, superluminal,
resonant photonics, magneto resonant gyros and accelerometers for
weapons.        DESCRIPTION:  The Air Force is developing advanced
technologies leading to small compact weapon systems, which need
micro-inertial measurement systems far beyond current state of the art.
     These applications range from unmanned air systems (UAS),
micro-air-vehicles (MAVS), miniature precision guided weapons, compact
high performance missile and air launched interceptors, and advanced
laser beam pointing\/steering systems. A pervasive need is for robust
small footprint inertial sensors that have robust environmental
characteristics and extreme sensitivity. Continued navigation, sensor
direction, and operation either in a GPS jammed environment, terrain
masking scenarios, or other severe environments is a persistent Air
Force need.      Recent DARPA, Air Force, and MDA, developments have
demonstrated gyros, rate sensors, and other instruments based on
optically pumped rubidium and cesium using single frequency
semiconductor lasers precisely tuned to the atomic resonance transition.
 These experiments using"atom"optics have shown great potential but have
 a long path to small system insertion. Recent experiments with"Fast
Light"have shown promising results to provide nearer term insertion with
 small footprint and an order of magnitude accuracy improvement.
Rubidium and cesium atomic sensor devices have shown promise for compact
 inertial microsystem applications, but are a long way from transition
into practical, ruggedized 3-axis flight and ground system applications.
 Basic research experiments as derivatives of chip scale atomic clocks
have shown that hybrid integrated optical-fast light devices could
potentially have large expensive laser ring gyro performance in sizes as
 small as 1 cubic centimeter.      A key stumbling block is application
of integrated optronics to miniaturize the racks of electronics used
support these novel sensors into a compact weapon footprint IMU. This
topic seeks to exploit integrated electro-optics to miniaturize and
share common functions to achieve the IMU 10-cubic- inch size goals for
precision weapons.     Recent breakthroughs in single frequency
semiconductor laser diodes and bidirectional amplifiers have enabled a
conceptual integration into a single laser driven multi-axis inertial
sensors with sense nodes on sub-centimeter cubed scale. These lasers are
 marginally available today from an offshore supplier, but DoD users and
 other contacts report long delivery times, low reliability, and
frequent failure to meet published specifications. Emerging domestic
suppliers must be developed to ensure stable sources of supply of these
precision lasers.      Miniaturized, frequency-agile, robust laser
systems that can operate autonomously while locked to atomic transitions
 with prescribed offsets up to 10 GHz are also needed.      The SBIR
topic solicits novel concepts and technologies in design, development,
and demonstration of components, subsystems, and systems to support
integrated optical atomic\/quantum 3-axis IMUs for rotational and linear
 inertial sensing (Inertial Measurement Units), replacement of digital
compasses, and target weapon fuzing.      Key components should provide
for stable operation of the drive and probe lasers, feedback and control
 of frequency and stability, microwave modulation of frequency for
offsets (e.g., Rb 85 and Rb 87 at 795 and 780 nanometers or Cesium D1
and D2 lines at 894 and 852 nanometers respectively).      The sensing
system should be able to withstand missile and tactical fighter aircraft
 temperature, acceleration, and vibration environments and not be
sensitive to electro-magnetic interference (EMI).       PHASE I:
Investigate integrated opto-electronics for advanced angular rate and
acceleration sensors. By simulation and\/or critical component
experiments, show feasibility of the proposed approach. Investigate
lasers, modulators, detectors and electro-optic components for inertial
sensors. Address stability, performance, and single frequency laser
power technology. Address integration into weapon IMUs.       PHASE II:

technologies and demonstrate functionality. Demonstrate feasibility and
engineering scale-up of technology; identify and address technological
hurdles. Demonstrate applicability to selected military weapon systems
and aircraft\/spacecraft environments, including vacuum, cryogenic
operation, and radiation exposure. Desired demonstration in laboratory
inertial test environments simulating weapon, missile flight dynamic
environments.       PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Develop and execute

Attack Weapons",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop high performance
accelerometers in a tactical size and cost range to dramatically enhance
 tactical IMU"s to strategic grade for long range weapons guidance
without GPS.       DESCRIPTION:  This topic is to address investigations
 of novel approaches for compact strategic grade accelerometers suited
for tactical munitions. The goal is to develop high performance, compact
 form factor, ruggedized accelerometer to improve tactical IMUs for long
 duration guidance without GPS. Current accelerometers limit IMU
accuracy as much as deficiencies in gyro rate sensors. There have been
several advanced MEMS-based resonant structure accelerometers
investigated for space applications that are approaching 1 micro G or
better sensitivities but the severe vibration and heat environment range
 for tactical application limits their suitability. The environment
ranges from very cold at start up -40 degrees C to above 70 degrees C
ambient with severe vibration and heat.      Very little investment in
precision inertial measurement unit (IMU) technologies for tactical
weapons has been made in recent years due to reliance on GPS and other
radio navigation technologies. The goal of this research is to address
gaps in high performance accelerometers improve tactical IMUs to

to fit into existing IMU packages with a sensor goal footprint of 1
cubic centimeter or better for a Tri-Axial accelerometer package with
integrated electronics. This area also includes the support
electronics\/electro-optics to transition into integrated radiation and
severe environment packages.      The eventual size goal is: Full IMU
package (3 Gyros + 3 Accelerometers + IMU sensor Processing &amp; Data
Interfaces) in less than 50 Cubic inches (with objective of 34 Cubic
Inches, which is the size of the HG 1700 IMU). The position accuracy
goal is less than 0.03 m (3D 1-Sigma) in 100 seconds of inertial only
flight (assume initial alignment) for current gravity drop weapons.
(Note that HG9900 IMU is about 103 Cubic inches)  For consideration,
assuming that just improving current IMU gyro bias to less than 0.0005
deg\/hr will produce a position error of 0.015 m in 100 sec. The other
impact is improving accelerometer bias. An accelerometer bias of 100
nano-G will likewise produce a position error about 0.005 m in 100 sec.
The overall IMU position error should be in the 0.03 m range given a 100
 sec time of flight.      The major contributors to the final position
error will be the mechanization errors such as algorithmic,
misalignment, etc. Other errors for new sensors IMU will have apart from
 the most obvious ones such as the misalignment and algorithmic must be
assessed and identified. The characterization phase of the IMU sensors
should provide that info. The 0.03 m error due to gyro and accelerometer
 biases simply means that biases are no longer the limitations, and
their contributions washes out when compared to other errors.      The
goals for IMU acceleration sensor are: Near-term (3-5 Years),
accelerometer sensitivity 25 Micro-G with IMU size less than 100 cubic
inches. For mid-term goals (5-10 years), assume an acceleration
sensitivity of 2.5 Micro-G and IMU size of less than 50 cubic inches.
For long term applications (10 years out), acceleration sensitivity of
less than 1 Micro-G with total volume smaller than 20 cubic inches is
the desired goal. A tactical IMU cost goal, including angular rate and
accelerometer sensors, is a unit production cost of under $15 K.
Tasks to get to a weapons grade IMU from sensors to be addressed include
 the following: characterization of errors to develop a full error
budget for gyro and accelerometer triads; inertial navigation
performance analysis including covariance and\/or Monte-Carlo
simulations in a weapon flight time (limited GPS); and
laboratory\/flight simulation qualification under weapon dynamics, and
flight environments. It is desired that in phase II prototype modules be
 available for government HWIL and flight testing at the end of Phase II
 and in Phase III.        PHASE I:  Research novel wide operating
temperature compact triaxial acceleration sensors that can augment
current and future weapon IMUs for long range navigation without GPS.
Demonstrate principals of physics with critical lab experiments and show
 by analysis and modeling the extrapolation based on packaging and
manufacturing technology maturity and transition for a five year
insertion goal.       PHASE II:  Develop and test prototype
accelerometers with IMU components. Demonstrate, through laboratory and
simulated flight environment testing, suitability for high sensitivity
with low drift rates. Show through analysis, test, and modeling that the
 proposed technology approach is compatible, supportable and improves
current weapons IMU navigation systems performance. Develop hardware in
the loop or flight test experiment modules for detailed characterization
 in simulated weapon trajectory environment.      PHASE III DUAL USE

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Research and develop dual-mode
LADAR\/RF seeker with hand-off operation capable of detection and
targeting in GPS-degraded and GPS-denied environment.       DESCRIPTION:
  As part of an analysis of operating in GPS-degraded and GPS-denied
environments, the Air Force has identified potential shortcomings in the
 terminal seeker technology of its existing arsenal of air-to-ground and
 stand-off weapons. The expected long ingress ranges and the high
likelihood of encountering electronic counter-measures (such as GPS
jamming) make it necessary to pursue robust weapon seekers possessing
the best characteristics of both LADAR\/IR and RF systems.  Existing
seekers do not currently possess the ability to detect targets at the
desired long ranges and are not dual-mode capable of terminal
high-resolution imaging.      AFRL desires technology solutions for a
dual-mode terminal seeker incorporating active RF target acquisition and
 LADAR imaging. The seeker technology should be engineered for
SEAD\/DEAD missions against fixed emplacements, possibly obscured by
camouflage, concealment and deception (CC &amp; D). Threshold detection
of ground targets, using RF, should occur at ranges between 20 to 40km.
In the terminal phase, the seeker should be capable of using multi-hit
LADAR returns to perform target imaging and acquisition. Detection of
targets with low reflectivity is desired, although this should be
accomplished using minimal power.      Seeker should be expected to
operate day\/night and in weather conditions to include clouds,
haze\/smoke, and rain. This is consistent with other fielded weapon
systems, which must be employable in all conditions where the expected
strike platforms (5th\/6th-generation aircraft) can operate.
Constraints on the design include overall size (5"- 7"diameter); some
tradespace exists in length and weight. Non-mechanical beam steering
designs, such as those incorporating electronically-scanned array
antennas, and technologies which reduce size, weight and power
requirements should also be explored, although the contractor is
encouraged to pursue other unique designs. Additionally, the seeker
modes should cooperatively hand-off target acquisition as the range of
the target decreases. A fast scanning ladar achieves a high degree of
spatial resolution to aid in target acquisition and classification,
especially in the presence of background noise and clutter.
Full-waveform analysis of multi-hit ladar returns is necessary to
penetrate concealed targets, under both natural and man-made obscurants.
 It is not necessary to consider navigational\/guidance technology for
the seeker at this time.      PHASE I:  Investigate the potential for
hybrid designs of dual-mode (ladar\/RF) seekers consistent with size,
weight and power requirements of an extended-detection range
flex\/modular air-launched weapon for SEAD\/DEAD missions. Bidder should
 propose a solution for resolving target images from multi-hit ladar
data, making use of foliage penetration (FOPEN) and other advanced ladar
 processing techniques.       PHASE II:  Develop complete dual-mode
seeker technology demonstrator that meets objectives of the seeker
requirements (stand-off detection range, LADAR imager scene size, etc.).
 Implementation of necessary signal processing algorithms to be made
available as a deliverable. Show ability to resolve likely targets from
background clutter.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Commercialize

temperature (HOT) MWIR [1] detector material such as nBn, high
temperature mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT), and super-lattice detectors
 have raised the operating temperature and reduced the cooling
requirement to the point where a compact, eighth of a watt cooler can
provide background limited performance. Therefore, a path to higher
operating temperature MWIR imaging seeker (with or possibly without) a
very low power micro cryogenic cooler is apparent. Since resolution and
detection range of uncooled infrared (LWIR) detectors and its long
integration time of 10s of milliseconds is detrimental in high speed
weapon applications, novel miniature MWIR seeker components are of
interest to future high speed weapons. Other recent developments and
demonstrations that make a miniature seeker feasible include wide field
of view (WFOV) optical developments [2] based on biological inspirations
 [3], on-focal plane array (built-in the  readout integrated circuit
(ROIC)) or"SMART"(also bio inspired) FPAs [4], and vision chips with a
variety of built-in image and signal processing functions [5, 6].
Demonstration of 10 micron pitch in the MWIR [1] allows for spatial
oversampling which provides benefits in sensitivity and detection [7].
It has long been known that there are numerous advantages to sampling
images hexagonally rather than rectangularly. Recent demonstrations in
the efficient processing of hexagonally sampled imagery [8] now make the
 utilization of hexagonal imagers feasible. The Weapon Engagement
Division of AFRL's Munitions Directorate is interested in exploiting the

 readout integrated circuit (ROIC) unit cell circuitry that optimizes
the HOT detector performance. high frame rate variable acuity ROIC

optimized to WFOV optics, compact imager control electronics for tightly
 coupled imager control and built-in processing for imager aided

applications, bigger imager format is not always better, but higher
frame rate. We are interested in a systems engineered design and
integration utilizing the recent infrared imaging technologies described
 above.      PHASE I:  Determine the feasibility of the proposed seeker
concept, and develop a design suitable for fabrication. Identify
critical components that make up a MWIR WFOV miniature weapon seeker.

will lead to the demonstration of a family of miniature MWIR seekers
that possess more integrated on-chip capabilities than are now

detonations in Fixed Targets",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop innovative High-Fidelity
Physics-Based (HFPB) Fast-Running Models (FRMs) for simulating the
effects of weapons detonated on contact or embedded in fixed target
structural materials.       DESCRIPTION:  Damage to fixed structures
resulting from the intentional or accidental detonation of weapons upon
contact or when embedded often results in hazards to nearby personnel,
equipment, and structures. Currently AFRL\/RWWL"s Modular Effectiveness
Vulnerability Assessment (MEVA) program does not have the capability to
predict these types of problems. In addition, other commercial and
military organizations need FRMs that predict the structural damage and
characteristics of debris generated by these events. The penetration,
perforation, and breach of these structures by munitions involve
multi-phase, multi-flow physics that has just recently been adequately
modeled in HFPB codes. What is now required by analysts and weaponeers
alike are innovative FRM methodologies that are based on these HFPB
codes but can be executed without the time penalty associated with them.
 These users do not have the expertise or the time required to run HFPB
calculations do to their need to execute hundreds, if not thousands, of
these calculations in very short periods of time.      Consequently, the
 primary requirement is to develop fast-running models based on HFPB
analyses that are representative of the HFPB analyses and have an
overall accuracy of 80% or better when compared to actual test data. The
 primary structural damage parameters of interest include hole size and
shape, rebar damage, mass and velocity of the debris generated, and
residual capacity of the damaged wall. The models must represent both
partial and full penetration of the structural materials and the
possible detonation of these weapons upon impact or after partial
penetration. The key technology areas are Weapon-Target Interaction,
Target Penetration, Impact &amp; Delayed Detonation, Back Face Spalling,
 and Debris generation.      Back face spalling of the target materials,
 including fragment size and velocity (vector) distributions are of
interest, particularly as they affect human and equipment vulnerability.
 The end states of weapon-generated rubble (quantity and spatial
distribution) are also desired.     When damage levels are sufficient to
 result in perforation(s) of the structural component, the model must
predict the hole size(s) and volume of material removed.  The model must
 output probabilistic debris fragment size and velocity (vector)
distributions and debris end-states (quantity and spatial distribution
of the debris on the ground). The models must be validated against
available experimental data with recommendations for additional testing
where sufficient data does not exist for adequate validation.     When
damage levels are not sufficient to result in perforation of the
structural component, the model must be capable of predicting the depth
of penetration, the effects of any explosive charge including debris
generation, the probabilistic distributions of debris fragment size and
velocity, and rubble end state. The model must cover materials such as
concrete and masonry (CMU, Brick, Adobe, Tile) used in fixed structures.
     The predictive accuracy of the models must be quantified, based on
comparisons with experimental data and HFPB calculations. Finally, the
contractor must implement the FRMs in AFRL\/RWWL"s MEVA architecture
which is used for assessing the lethality of conventional weapons. To
this end, MEVA will be provided along with the necessary integration
instructions. If necessary, access to the MEVA developer will be
provided or he can be hired to do the integration.     Other users
include the Army (ARL &amp; AMSAA), AFLCMC, and JTCG\/ME. Following this
 effort, the government will install the FRMs in the AFLCMC FIST program
 and finally in the JTCG\/ME JWS weaponeering program.      PHASE I:
Develop innovative FRM methodologies that can be trained by
state-of-the-art HFPB calculations to simulate the effects of weapon
contact or embedded detonations in fixed targets. Demonstrate their
ability to capture the important characteristics of these multi-physics
phenomena.      PHASE II:  Develop FRMs to simulate the effects of
weapon contact or embedded detonations in fixed structures constructed
of concrete &amp; masonry material. The FRMs must capture the important
characteristics of the phenomena for a parameter space spanning weapon
type and size, and structural geometry and materials of practical
significance. Implement these models in the AFRL MEVA program.
PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Military: Complete the development of
the FRMs for the range of weapons and structural components\/materials
required. Commercial: Used by HAZMAT teams to asses safety for explosive
 materials. Used in assessing safety of buildings designed for
protection against natural and terrorist threats.",

rapid evolution of new seeker, guidance units, &amp; fuzing for

tightly integrated"stove-pipe"closed architectures. Technology
innovation to improve weapon performance, increase mission
effectiveness, reduce acquisition cost, and extend weapon support
lifetime are often negatively impacted by unique proprietary weapon data
 interconnect architectures. This topic is to investigate an open
architecture"plug and play"concept for the communication, guidance and
control, fuzing, and safe and arm functions along with communications to
 the aircraft or ground controller (weapon -aircraft interface and
weapon data link). This will consist of building a technical framework
that will begin by defining several open interfaces for a BUS system to
connect the communication, guidance and control, fuzing, and safe and
arm functions together. This will be the basis for a technical framework
 that will be developed. From this technical framework a technical
service oriented architecture will be designed in a current software
modeling language. Each service will be unassociated, loosely coupled
units of functionality that are self-contained. Ultimately this will
allow simultaneous use and easy mutual data exchange between modules of
the weapon developed by different vendors without additional programming
 or making changes to the services.     By example new improvements in
fly by light transponders and environmentally rugged fiber optics
provide opportunities to replace costly and delicate cable\/connector
assemblies. Kalman and optimally filtered guidance schemes provide for
novel opportunities to mix and match inertial, seeker, and GPS inputs
instead of tightly integrated stove pipe guidance schemes of the past.
New secure wireless network technologies may provide opportunities for
minimal cabling through the aircraft bay, racks and pylons providing
maximum flexibility for which type of weapon can be carried on a
particular rack. Investigate functional equivalents for MILSTD 1553 and
1760 protocols along with new"broadcast Remote Direct Memory Access"RDMA
 and precision time protocols that would support rapid addressing
multiple weapons at the same time.     The goal is to provide the
ability to develop weapons components, guidance law software and
processors, target recognition and track modules, attitude and control
units, seekers and sensors and be able to integrate rapidly technology
from various sources in response to new and evolving user needs. An
example would be to re-utilize a seeker from an current weapon on a new
weapon without extensive redevelopment time and cost.      PHASE I:
Investigate critical components to demonstrate a robust plug and play
framework for weapon systems. This framework should address various open
 interface standards from Optical to Wireless. Various use cases should
be developed and defined. Estimate cost,size, and weight savings over
current cabled weapons systems and racks. Determine interfaces to legacy
 weapons and launcher systems.      PHASE II:  Develop and demonstrate a
 modular weapon open interface architecture based on the framework
developed in Phase I. This should include both seeker and guidance and
Control modules. Functional and system testing of the architecture will
be used to verify the architecture against the design documents and
specifications developed in Phase I. The use cases developed in Phase I
will be turned into test cases to provide traceability throughout the
development.       PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Working with DoD
weapon primes, develop and demonstrate flight functional units and
provide live drop testing showing accuracy, performance, and long term
logistical cost savings to the U.S. government.",

Environment Dynamics (DAMPED)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop innovative analytic tools to
 describe the stochastic\/probabilistic features of the penetration fuze
 environment and analyze using data mining from diverse experimental and
 computational data sources.        DESCRIPTION:  The operational
dynamic environment for hard target fuzes is known to be exceedingly
harsh. The environment is typically characterized as having long
duration, high amplitude, high frequency content, impulsive loading
characteristics (i.e., shock-like). The loading is also multiaxial and
typically involves several repeated impulses (i.e., repeated loading
cycles). Finally, the penetration dynamics are anything but repeatable,
even nominally identical test events can have orders-of-magnitude
difference in severity, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This is
due (at least in part) to natural variations in the weapon systems
(assembly and materials), targets (strength, geometry, etc.), and a host
 of other contributing factors (such as incident attitude of the
weapon). All of these factors support the assertion that hard target
fuzes experience a harsh, complex, stochastic environment.       While
several individual metrics\/figures-of-merit have been proposed and used
 to describe the environment, it is beyond the current state-of-the-art
to completely parameterize and describe in a probabilistic sense (e.g.,
using the joint probability distribution) the various aspects of the
mechanical environment that are relevant to evaluating fuze
survivability and lethality. Additionally, the survivability of a given
fuze system in a range of weapon systems and\/or operational target
engagement scenarios must also be considered and described using this
same probabilistic language. Given the high dimensionality (i.e., the
number of contributing parameters is&gt;&gt;10), it is impractical from a
 resource or schedule standpoint to build this information using test
data alone. However, combining empirical and computational simulation
data can provide valuable insight into the environment, and both sources
 of data need to be assimilated. (Note:  Available test and simulation
data will be provided as government-furnished information at the
initiation of the contracted effort.)      This SBIR topic seeks to
develop and mature the language and analytic tools necessary to describe
 this environment in a probabilistic sense and improve the accuracy
(i.e., the predictive power) of simulations. It is expected that this
effort would lead to the development of tools and submodels that
evaluate the mission-level performance\/effectiveness (i.e.,
survivability, reliability, and lethality) of a fuze design for
arbitrary operational scenarios. The long-term vision of this effort is
to establish a new paradigm for evaluating the design margin of fuzes in
 operational environments, complementing empirically-based methods such
as the Fuze Survivability Protocol with probabilistic modeling tools.
    Note: The data, analysis methods, and results are expected to be
classified at or above the Secret level.       PHASE I:  Define analytic
 techniques to describe the fuze environment. Document and develop
interface information on data sources and formats, including both
experimental and simulation. Apply methodology to empirical
laboratory-scale shock test data to demonstrate viability of approach.
    PHASE II:  Refine analytic toolset to accommodate diverse sources of
 information. Perform analysis on all available information for an
inventory legacy penetrating weapon system and write document
summarizing environment. Develop user interfaces and optimize data
management to ensure usability.       PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:

systems that improve operations in the A2AD environments, including low
probability of intercept; resistance to interference; and, greater

     DESCRIPTION:  The future of radar sensors will be software defined
and have flexible missions. They will need to operate cooperatively in
hostile environments and meet the demanding cost, size, weight and power
 (CSWaP) constraints of weapons for 5th- and 6th-generation platforms in
 all-weather conditions. Furthermore, in the Anti Access\/Area Denial

 during ingress is crucial. Cooperative radar sensors will have
beneficial characteristics for improved operations in the A2AD
environments, including low probability of intercept, resistance to
interference, and greater flexibility in accomplishing assigned missions
 with reduced timeline.      Due to the size constraints (9"diameter),
and required operating ranges (&gt;10 Km), cooperative RF sensor systems
 are expected to operate in the Ku or Ka bands. In order to accomplish
this, advanced digital signal processing techniques will be required to
implement the adaptive clutter and interference mitigation algorithms

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Use electromagnetic (EM) fields to
alter the properties or combustion of energetic materials. Exploit these
 effects for real-time control of sensitivity, energy release, or power
release, or greater lethality from combined kinetic-EM effects.
DESCRIPTION:  The primary objectives are to understand and control
sensitivity thresholds, energy release, and\/or power release from
energetic materials using electromagnetic (EM) fields, and to exploit
this for selectable kinetic effects or combined kinetic-electromagnetic
effects.     The industrial community has used electromagnetic fields to
 control combustion in low-rate commercial processes, but there has been
 little work in energetic materials with higher combustion rates, i.e.,
propellants, pyrotechnics, and explosives. The need for real-time
sensitivity and rate control is driven by the need for munitions that
are more insensitive (i.e., safer), more flexible (i.e., tunable), and
more lethal (i.e., enhanced effects).     User control of pre-combustion
 properties and\/or energy release may require novel energetic materials
 and novel initiation techniques. This effort may involve development of
 new energetics that are sensitive to electromagnetic fields [1],
exploitation of electromagnetic properties in existing energetics [2]),
or doping existing energetics with EM-sensitive materials (e.g.,
photoresponsive additives). It may require novel initiation techniques
-- external electromagnetic fields [3], shock from single or multipoint
initiation sources, or some combination of the two.  EM fields might be
used to produce physical or chemical effects such as: mechanical strain,
 stress, or shear; localized ohmic heating (i.e., hot spot generation
[3]); chemical changes [1]; or alterations in the energetic material's
plasma chemistry or other property [4, 5]. Candidate materials include
organic explosives, inorganic explosives (e.g., thermites,
intermetallics), propellants, and pyrotechnics. The proposer might
consider the effect of EM fields on different material phases (solid,
liquid, gas, plasma, metallic glass, etc) and composite materials (e.g.,
 doped or metalized explosives).    The physics and chemistry affecting
sensitivity is poorly understood. The energetics community usually
relies on empirically-determined"go\/no-go"thresholds for combustion
on-set. This approach provides vital safety criteria, but does not
advance our understanding of how to control initiation thresholds and
combustion processes in real-time. This project may need physics-based
and chemistry-based models to understand the effect of electromagnetic
fields on combustion, and novel instrumentation and diagnostic methods
that provide spatial and temporal resolution of the physics and
thermochemistry of electromagnetically-enhanced combustion. Model
development and diagnostic development are important enabling
technologies but these alone do not meet the objectives of this topic.
There must be development of a concept that controls and exploits these
EM-energetic effects.     For example, the EM-energetic effect might be
control of combustion rate in energetic materials for a selectable yield
 weapon. The combustion regimes of interest include burn, deflagration,
detonation, and overdriven detonation. [Note: The concept need not
include all four regimes.]     This topic places no restrictions on the
electromagnetic wavelength domain, but the proposal should discuss any
design limitations, consequences, or adverse effects associated with the
 design choice, and whether the concept is compatible with the Hazards
of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) standards. Although
weaponization of an electromagnetic source is outside the scope of this
effort (if an external source is part of the concept), the proposal
should discuss the weaponization potential of the EM source -- power
levels, miniaturization, thermal and shock hardening, etc.     This
topic excludes explosive pulsed power devices (i.e., explosive flux
compression generators (EFCG)) or EFCG-driven kinetic weapons. The topic
 does include technologies in which both kinetic and electromagnetic
effects are combined for enhanced lethal effects on the target.
PHASE I:  Develop a means to alter an explosive's properties or its
combustion behavior with an electromagnetic field and a concept to
exploit this effect for a selectable effect or enhanced lethality
warhead. Use or develop physics-based and chemistry-based modeling.
Small-scale testing to show proof-of-concept is highly desirable. Merit
and feasibility must be clearly demonstrated during this phase.
PHASE II:  Develop, demonstrate, and validate the component technology
in a prototype based on the modeling, concept development, and success
criteria developed in Phase I. Deliverables are a prototype
demonstration, experimental data, a model baselined with experimental
data, and substantiating analyses.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:
 Military applications include insensitive munitions, enhanced
lethality, selectable effect, and low collateral damage munitions.
Commercial applications include variable-rate airbag inflation and low
collateral damage weapons for DHS and law enforcement in sensitive urban
 scenarios.",

and\/or processes for the production of cast aerospace components with
improved dimensional control and material properties through efficient
heat transfer and thermal stress management.       DESCRIPTION:  High
performing turbine airfoils and structural components for turbine
engines are typically produced via investment casting. Investment
casting molds are created by successive iterations of slurry dipping,
stucco application and hardening over a wax replica of the final casting
 geometry. These ceramic molds (or shells) are typically designed to (1)
 minimize structural failure of the mold prior to solidification, (2)
provide sufficient casting surface finish and (3) crush during cool down
 to minimize stresses in the casting. Concurrently, casting core
materials and processes (that ultimately provide internal features in
castings) have matured separately from investment molds, limiting
integration of the two processes in order to achieve superior
dimensional control of the final casting.      However, the baseline
process and materials are not optimized for heat transfer or thermal
stress management during solidification. These deficiencies lead to: (1)
 non-optimized dendritic structure, (2) limitations on castability of
fine-feature geometries, and (3) dimensional tolerance stack ups that
lead to design constraints particularly for thin walls and fine
features. These processing shortfalls manifest in increased propensity
of material defects, distortion, mold cracking (run out) and design
limitations for minimum feature size and minimum wall thickness.
The AF is seeking to develop casting mold materials and\/or processes

adequate ITO repair. Develop methods for the production of transparent
conductive materials that are durable and easily applied for repair of
scratches in ITO on transparent substrates.        DESCRIPTION:  Indium
tin oxide (ITO) is a traditional material of choice for conductive
transparent coatings for use in many current and future Air Force
applications. Applications include the dissipation of and shielding from
 incident energy and electrodes for display technologies,
opto-electronic devices, and harvesting solar energy. While current
technologies meet desired metrics for sheet resistance and
transmittance[1,2], ITO is not durable, easily applied, or cost
effective. During the lifetime of the ITO coating, scratches and nicks
develop and begin to degrade its performance. Current repair processes
use time consuming, labor intensive processes which are only temporary,
and reduce visibility in the repaired area and tend to chip or peel off,
 which requires reapplication, and often the surrounding ITO coating is
further damaged.       When the size of the damaged area increases
beyond an acceptable level, the entire coating must be replaced, which
is expensive and increases aircraft downtime. Currently, this repair
process includes the removal of the entire transparency and shipment to
specialized facilities wherein the coating is stripped and reapplied in
large vacuum chambers which is very costly, wastes a large amount of
indium and requires specialized equipment. Although this approach
successfully returns the part in pristine condition, it also requires
several weeks or months to complete, considerable maintenance,
inspection and combat recertification, during which time the aircraft is
 out of commission. In addition to down time, Indium is an expensive
element that has seen an enormous price increase in the last 10 years
and is being utilized more and more by the electronics industry.
Currently, there is not a domestic source for indium[3], and there is a
desire to decrease reliance on Indium.      Alternatives to traditional
ITO repair may include, but are not limited to, novel ITO manufacturing
techniques that lower cost and time of large area deposition and allow
depot maintenance, and non-ITO \/Hybrid approaches such as polymer
composites, thin single wall carbon nanotube\/graphene networks, or thin
 films of inorganic\/organic hybrids. Application techniques amenable to
 depot conditions (ambient temperature, humidity, pressure) are
preferred and may include spraying, or rolling in order to fill
scratches or gaps that are problematic in typical ITO coatings.
This project will develop the capability to produce filler material for
scratch repair in current ITO coatings.      Potential commercial
applications of this technology could include the repair of cellular
phone or computer touch-screens, which also require continuous
transparent conductive coatings in order to function properly.

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To develop a tool capable of
measuring the conductivity of coatings and gap fillers (sealants) on
surfaces with complex curves.        DESCRIPTION:  The current point
inspection tool (Tier I) that is used to inspect electrically conductive
 coatings on the aircraft is a waveguide cavity probe. The probe is an
open-ended waveguide of defined length, that is excited on the feed end
through a circular iris. When the open end of the waveguide is placed on
 a flat conductive surface, a cavity is formed. The Quality Factor (Q)
of the cavity is measured and the conductivity of the terminating wall
is calculated. Errors are induced when the surface being inspected is
non-planar due to leakage around the gap created by the waveguide and
the curved surface being inspected. It is desirable to have a device
that can measure the conductivity of coatings and gap fillers on mildly
curved compound surfaces.      The measurement device should be capable
of determining surface conductivity (ie: ohms per square) of conductive
coatings and gap fillers. It is desirable to measure this within the
8-18 GHz frequency band, though not necessarily across the entire band. A
 single broad-band probe is highly desirable. The probe will be used on
fielded air vehicles and cannot damage the surface being measured. The
device should pose no safety hazard to personnel or equipment. It shall
be capable of being approved for flight line operation. The surface will
 not typically be flat and therefore should conform to the surface being
 tested. Assume that the probe must accommodate surfaces from flat to a
compound radius of curvature of approximately 50 inches. The equipment
should also have the ability to support higher radii of curvature. The
probe should be capable of measuring small areas to support gap filler
inspection. A smaller footprint is desirable. It is anticipated that the
 probe will work in conjunction with a government furnished vector
network analyzer. The analyzer is a two port instrument and it is
desirable that the probe not require additional ports. A standalone
device or one that utilizes special test equipment is acceptable. It is
expected that this probe will be transportable and operable by a single
technician.  Considerations during the design of any equipment used for
this end should include: robustness, hand held use in the field, and
Class I, Div II certification.      PHASE I:  Investigate concepts that
may be applicable to non-destructive, in-situ evaluation of the
electrical conductivity of gap fillers. The range of conductivity shall
be between 0 to 10 ohms\/square. It is be desirable for the technique
performed through a thin dielectric coating. Demonstrate a measureable
approach on a test panel with a 0.25"wide by 0.25"deep by&gt;6"long
filled gap.      PHASE II:  Ruggedize equipment, workout
commercialization issues, partner with any appropriate companies to
ensure successful production, meet other needs of the user. Demonstrate
hand-held, ruggedized version to be fielded.      PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: This conformal conductivity measurement technology is
expected to be used on military aircraft with conductive coatings and
curved surfaces. Commercial use could include any measurement of
electrical properties on curved surfaces.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a repeatable technology to
relieve stress in a weldment using vibration stress relief. The AF
currently doesn't have many ways to repair large weldments and this
process may provide the ability to repair major structural components.
     DESCRIPTION:  Vibration Stress Relief is gaining momentum in heavy
industry as a way to reduce the residual stress built up during the
welding process. If the processes currently established in industry can
be shown to be mature, repeatable and controllable then the potential
exists to perform on-airplane stress relief of weld repairs greatly
increasing the reparability of the F-22 titanium frames and the forward
and aft booms. Currently these structures cannot be weld repaired due to
 the required high temperature thermal stress relief process. Thus
repairs often involve material removal and patches, causing more
downtime and elaborate repairs.      This task could have great benefit
to the customer in allowing them to perform on airplane weld stress
relief. The US Department of Energy has said that vibration stress
relief is a,"proven substitute to 80-90% of heat treat stress relief
applications yet saves 65-95% of the time and cost in doing so without
sacrificing quality!"A quick investigation of the Boeing Library
indicates that it was last investigated in 1987 where it was shown to
have promise but was not yet repeatable. Discussions with vendors
indicate that the process has greatly matured in the subsequent 25 years
 [1-3].      PHASE I:  Assess the reliability of a vibration stress
relief (VSR) process to relieve the weld-induced stresses in a Ti-6Al-4V
 weldment using a reliable measurement technique, e.g., X-Ray
diffraction, to characterize surface stresses before and after stress
relief. Gauge R &amp; R methods should be applied to both the process
and the measurements to validate the VSR process effectiveness.
PHASE II:  Expand the applicability of VSR to a broad spectrum of
prototypical weld configurations \/ structural applications and develop a
 strategy to mature the technology to meet aerospace quality weld
requirements at the fleet level. Demonstrate the effectiveness of VSR to
 improve the weld integrity to ensure improved mechanical performance
and structural durability over untreated welds.       PHASE III DUAL USE

validated, turnkey VSR process \/ system that can be applied to the weld
 repair of aerospace structural components to meet Air Force and OEM

to characterize proposed material\/material couple and a predictive tool

 dissimilar materials\/barriers under controlled environmental

priority for USAF aircraft system managers. However, there are currently
 no design trade tools available to aerospace engineers that effectively
 characterize the behavior of common airframe construction materials and
 account for their contributions to galvanic corrosion. Obtaining such a
 tool is critical during design of new aircraft structures as well as
legacy airframe repair material selections as a means of moving from the
 philosophical goal of"find and fix"to a presumably more
cost-effective"predict and manage."This necessitates development of
novel trade tools which can predict the galvanic corrosion-specific
performance of common structural materials, fastening, and proposed
barrier scheme\/s. The tool will allow designers the ability to validate
 material selection, providing prediction and economical life cycle
management of the weapon system.      PHASE I:  Illustrate feasibility
by developing and demonstrating a prototype tool to quantify material
couples &amp; predict galvanic corrosion. The materials will be bare

        "topic_name": "Durable, Low Friction Coating for Variable Speed
Refueling Drogue (VSRD)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate a durable
coating that can be applied to the MC-130J"s VSRD outer ribs in order to
 increase the mean time between failures and reduce life cycle cost.
   DESCRIPTION:  The Variable Speed Refueling Drogue (VSRD) is used on
the MC-130J to refuel helicopters with probe-and-drogue refueling
systems. The program objective is to develop a sustainable, suitable,
and cost effective aerial refueling drogue for the 37 MC-130J Commando
II aircraft. The new VSRD system will be capable of supporting an
airspeed envelope of 105-210 Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS), providing
aerial refueling support for SOF CV-22 and rotary-wing platforms.
The current VSRD coating wears off after about 250 cycles and creates a
problem where the drogue will get stuck in the refueling pod storage
tube, thus precluding the MC-130J from performing its intended refueling
 mission. The thirty year life cycle estimate for rib replacement due to
 coating wear-out for the entire MC-130J fleet is approximately $112
million. The MC-130J program office is looking for a more durable, low
friction material to recoat the rib. This would help extend the VSRD
mean time between failures. The program office estimates that this will
lower the life cycle cost to approximately $43 million.        The
purpose of this SBIR effort is to overcome the above deficiencies by
developing a new, more durable material that can facilitate the drogue
entering and exiting the refueling storage tube for the drogue.
There are many different types of coatings in industry, but none has the
 functionality needed for the harsh operating conditions in which the
VSRD is used. The contractor that developed the VSRD researched and
tested about eight candidates and determined that a Keronite base coat
with a Xylan 1088 top coat provided the best combination of durability
and low friction.       What is needed is a coating which can withstand
more cycles scraping against screw heads and the inside of the refueling
 pod storage tube and have a low coefficient of friction. The new
coating must be able to be applied by field maintenance personnel to
6XXX series aluminum without the need for special equipment to apply or
cure the coating.      PHASE I:  Define the coating requirements.
Identify appropriate coatings for evaluation.  Develop sample batches of
 potential coatings. Apply coatings to typical VSRD aluminum substrates.
 Perform laboratory validation to demonstrate\/validate friction and
wear performance. Downselect coatings to be demonstrated during Phase
II.      PHASE II:  Apply the coating to a Variable Speed Refueling
Drogue (VSRD) and test it in a relevant environment. Demonstrate field
application. Develop production quantities of coating. Expected
Technology Readiness Level of the coating by the end of Phase II is TRL
6, and preferably TRL 7.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Military
Application: Air refueling pods; equipment that requires continued
maintenance due to friction between control surfaces.  Commercial

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a light weight,
standardized, robust, affordable, portable drilling system capable of
inserting fasteners and torquing associated nuts. The design should
allow for growth (e.g. - insertion and upsetting of rivets for final
installation).        DESCRIPTION:  Legacy sheet metal aircraft such as
the C-130J have hundreds of thousands of fasteners with the vast
majority drilled and installed by hand, one at a time. This work is
labor intensive, increases the production span of aircraft, generates
repetitive motion injuries, and is a source for quality issues. The
manual drilling process requires other steps during the assembly
operation including de-stacking the assembly, de-burring individual
holes, applying sealant to the parts if required, reassembling the parts
 and wet installation of fasteners with sealant. Completing the fastener
 installation requires setting the torque for the threaded fastener
nuts. Traditional fastener installation machines are very large, heavy,
expensive, and immobile systems which perform the drill-fasten operation
 without the de-stack and de-burr processes. Major drawbacks to the
traditional systems are: they are dedicated to a limited number of parts
 which greatly restricts the possible applications, they cannot access
confined spaces, and they fall into the category of capital equipment.
     The envisioned system shall be capable of drilling, installing and
setting threaded fasteners in common aircraft alloys on legacy aircraft
assemblies in a production environment. As a possible future adaptation,
 consideration shall be given to the installation and upsetting of
rivets. The system will be affordable, portable, and easy to integrate.
It should be hand-held, with a target maximum weight of 15lb. Solutions
that are heavier will be seriously considered if they offer a valid
approach, for example, if the heavier system is supported by a tool
balancer. The system should be priced low enough to allow it to be
purchased in large quantities and to be applied across multiple
applications\/programs. The current target price for the hand-held tool
is $30K but can increase based on the capabilities of the tool. An
initial cost benefit analysis of any solution shall be performed near
the end of the Ph II effort. The intent is to be able to drill and
install fasteners in various assemblies with a common tool. The system
must be able to accomplish these tasks without the de-stack and de-burr
processes while producing a high quality hole. The system shall also be
easy to maintain and utilize common components wherever possible.
  The expected output of the Phase I and Phase II topic is a prototype
system that will be considered for implementation and therefore, needs
to meet manufacturer specifications. It is highly encouraged that
offerors are willing to work with and have a letter of support from the
system OEM. Detailed specification information is proprietary but more
information will be made available following Phase I and Phase II
awards. The outlined tasks are: locate hole (through sheet metal
template or pilot hole), provide sufficient clamp force to eliminate
delamination during drilling which prevents inter-laminar burrs, drill
through stack-up, apply sealant, insert fastener, retain fastener (upset
 rivet or thread on a nut). The maximum allowed burr on the exit side of
 the hole is 0.002". The requirement on sealant is that there must be a
witness of sealant squeeze out under the head and the tail of the
fastener. Torque accuracy requirements for application of nuts is +-4% +
 2in-lb. Rivet tail requirement is tail height must be equal to 1
diameter and the tail diameter must be at least two diameters.
Numerous companies in the aerospace industry provide high quality,
self-feeding, portable, drilling systems, some of which possess the
capability to provide clamp force usually through the mechanism of a
pneumatic cleco. There also exists hand held automatic fastening systems
 capable of running nuts on threads from a preloaded"magazine". The new
technology would marry these two existing capabilities along with an
automated fastener insertion device, and sealant applicator to create a
complete single pass drill and fill operation.       The fasteners are
standard MS rivets and interference fit HI-Tigue threaded fasteners. It
is not expected one unit to be able to install both rivets and threaded
fasteners. It should be assumed that separate units will be used for the
 different fastener types.        PHASE I:  The focus of Phase I will be
 a feasibility study and the development of a preliminary design(s) for a
 Portable Drill-Fastener System. Initial estimates of unit size, weight,
 capabilities, and single unit cost are expected. Unit fabrication
(prototyping) is not expected in Phase I.      PHASE II:  Phase II will
be on the selection of a design from Phase I and the production of a
prototype system. Demonstration\/validation of the prototype shall be
conducted in a simulated production environment. Evaluation will be
based on unit and operational costs, robustness, ease of
use\/maintenance, human factors\/ergonomics, portability, weight,
safety, and ability to perform all tasks outlined in the OEM
specifications. The contractor shall perform a cost benefit analysis of
the prototype design.       PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III
will take the prototype demonstrated in a simulated production
environment and further develop the system for production use. Upon
completion of testing, any redesign effort would be completed to move
the prototype into production.",

Substrates",

exists to develop an abrasion resistant coating for composite structures
 capable of protecting the substrates during media blast coating removal
 operations. This new coating would function as a protective barrier to
the substrate and coatings beneath it. Successful transition of such a
technology would have far reaching sustainment benefits to both the USAF
 and modern commercial aerospace platforms. The new coating must be
compatible with currently fielded coating systems and must not impact
the function of these existing materials. The technology must be thin
(0.5-1.2 mils) and lightweight (compared to COTS coatings currently used
 of the same thickness) to serve as a dry media resistant barrier to be
used on thin skinned composite substrates. The new material must be
compatible to new or mechanically stripped composite substrates and the
protective coating finish system, i.e. a outer mold line paint stackup.
The thin coating should resist any discernible or measurable damage from
 the following dry media: wheat starch and MIL-P-85891, Type VII. During

representative 12"x 12"composite substrate specimens with a paint
stack-up representative of the modern USAF weapon systems. The 12"x
12"specimens will be subject to the following laboratory tests: dry
media blast, ASTM D4541 (PATTI), and composite flexibility testing. The
coating should be semi-permanent -- it must have a documented removal
process (non-media blast) that allows a maintainer to remove the new
coating without damaging the coatings\/substrate that resides below. The
 coating must exhibit acceptable adhesion properties to other common
coatings and substrates used by the US Air Force. The coating must
withstand temperatures, moisture reversion, and UV degradation in a
normal operating aerospace environment. It is preferred the technology
is compliant with standard coating application equipment so it can be
applied by field units in an operational environment.       PHASE I:

benefit analysis will be provided by the contractor to the USAF to
assist with transition efforts. Phase III transition plan must be

        "topic_name": "Remotely Controlled Exhaust Coating Defect
Mapping System",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a compact, ruggedized
remotely controlled exhaust coating defect mapping system.
DESCRIPTION:  Assessment of damage in inlets and exhaust cavities is
necessary to evaluate aircraft readiness and flight safety. Current
procedures rely on human performed inspections consisting of visually
locating defects in these confined spaces and manually determining
defect types, dimensions, and location for transfer to an assessment
system. Manual procedures ensuring 100% inspection within small cavities
 can be difficult to perform due to maneuverability, are time consuming,
 and are prone to human error.       The Air Force seeks an automated
system capable of robotically traversing serpentine inlets, exhaust and
other tight cavities with the ability to inspect 100% of the cavity
surface and automatically identify defects such as cracks and missing
material. These defects must be accurately referenced to known
coordinates within the inlet or exhaust structure. Defect data from this
 mapping tool must be fed into structural coordinates and photographs
must be captured to complete the mapping process. The system must
generate a report with the locations, number, size and\/or area of
defects.       The rover must be highly mobile using tracks or wheels
and can be tethered with a cable for data and power. The rover must be
capable of automatically traversing a programmed path through the cavity
 assuring 100% inspection based on the sensing modality. While an
optical defect mapping head is envisioned (Line Scan, LIDAR or other
optical technology), other sensing systems are acceptable. Modular
system architecture with the ability to accommodate a variety of NDI
sensing technologies is highly desirable.       The mapping device must
be used on fielded air vehicles and cannot damage the surface being
traversed. Consideration should be given to collision avoidance and to
ensure safe manual removal in the event of system, software, or power
failure.  The tool should pose no safety hazard to personnel or
equipment and must be used in a fueled environment. It shall be capable
of being approved for flight line operation. It is expected that this
system will be transportable and operable by a single technician.
Considerations during the design of any equipment used for this should
include: robustness, use in the field, and Class I, Div II
certification.      This capability will improve confidence in defect
location mapping for transfer to assessment systems. A reduction of
maintenance induced damage from maintainers climbing in and out of
inlets, exhaust and small cavities for inspections. Additionally, a
reduction of maintenance man hours is expected. Inlets and exhaust are
inspected before every flight. Detailed inspections on exhaust tailpipes
 are conducted at the end of every week and at 200 flight hours. These
inspections take an hour per cavity plus mapping and reporting time.
Maintainers are required to don full protective suits with respirators
and locate missing material in extremely confined areas further
extending inspections. An automated inspection system will free the
maintainer from the demanding task and free them to address other needs.
      PHASE I:  Develop a compact, rugged defect mapping sensor for
inlets, exhaust and small cavities designed to fit onto a carriage. The
system must identify cracks 0.010"Wide and map missing material greater
than 0.35 sq in. Physical size constraints for the mapping system are
6"H x12"W x13"L. Begin integration onto a mobile, remotely controlled
carriage that can traverse at least 14'into a pipe or duct.      PHASE
II:  Finalize sensor\/carriage integration and develop automated
movement, damage registration and mapping. System must tolerate engine
soot and fluids and recognize damage regardless. Damage mapping in areas
 of 7"H is required but fidelity must be maintained in larger areas of
the cavity.  Testing and development on a representative inlet, exhaust
or cavity highly recommended, a structure may be provided for
demonstration. System must map 100% of the cavity in 60 minutes.
PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This automated inspection tool will
benefit military aircraft which require frequenct inspection within
small cavities. Commercial aircraft as well as other industrial
applications requiring inspection of confined spaces should also benefit
 from this this technology.",

        "topic_name": "Methods to Enable Rapid Qualification of Additive
 Manufacturing Processes",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop model assisted experimental
processes that will rapidly estimate the dimensions of life-limiting
defects and their probability of occurrence in additively manufactured
and\/or repaired components.        DESCRIPTION:  Additive Manufacturing
 (AM) is the process of taking a digital representation of a part or
component and directly manufacturing the resulting product using an
automated, three-dimensional fabrication technique such as Electron Beam
 Additive Manufacturing (EBAM) or Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS).
Current efforts to use AM for fabrication or repair of hardware require
the iteration of empirical Design of Experiments (DOE) to optimize alloy
 selection and processing parameters. Each DOE yields a large number of
physical specimens that are characterized using two-dimensional image
analysis. Metallographic data is then analyzed and the process is
optimized to yield a required microstructure free from defects such as
cracks, un-melted particles, and porosity. Mechanical test specimens are
 then fabricated and tensile, creep, fatigue, and crack growth
properties are determined and used for component design and reliability
assessment. Finally, fabricated components are inspected and
characterized to ensure their microstructure and properties align with
the assumptions used for their design and reliability analysis. This
process results in a significant level of effort and cycle time, and a
number of iterations are usually required before the process parameters
are optimized to design requirements and manufacturability.       Rapid
qualification of AM processes will require the development of a
methodology that accurately captures the relationship between the key
input parameters and location-specific microstructure, as well as the
relationship between the microstructure and mechanical properties and
component durability. The methodology would integrate process
information, non-destructive evaluation (NDE), stress analysis and
damage tolerance simulations into the design process. Key input
parameters and location specific material microstructure, as well as a
relationship between the microstructure and mechanical properties and
component durability can be established via DOE  based on analysis for
the parameters for which predictive physics-based models are available,
or based on specimen testing (and microstructure\/ fractography
characterization) where such predictive models are not available. The
probability of detection of these anomalies can be investigated with a
NDE inspection simulation tool (e.g., XRSIM). The likelihood that the
predicted array of anomalies will lead to a failure can be determined by
 a fatigue crack growth simulation. With this approach, the DOE provides
 initial anomaly information, the stress analysis provides a value for
the critical size of an anomaly and the NDE assessment provides a
detectability measure. The combination of these tools allows for
accept\/reject criteria to be determined at the early design stage and
enables damage tolerant design philosophies.       It is anticipated
that this approach will address the stochastic nature of both process
variability (e.g., machine to machine variability) and the geometric
complexity typically found in aerospace components and will not be
limited to simplified scenarios, such as plates, cylinders, or other
simple geometric configurations.       While the above integrated
process characterization and modeling effort may add to the initial
development cost of AM components, it is anticipated that it will only

basis for a probabilistic predictive system that can be relatively
easily adjusted for a variety of components of different volumes,

environment for uncertainty quantification and risk assessment that can
be effectively utilized for rapid process optimization and components
qualification.       PHASE I:  Demonstrate a proof of concept capability

characterization method on a generic but representative structural
aircraft or turbine engine component. With assistance from the TPOC,
demonstrate the capability for at least one relevant fabrication or
repair application with at least one prospective end-user. Develop a
business model for application of the methodology.      PHASE III DUAL

nonlinear optical materials",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To prepare aberration-free gradient
index linear and nonlinear optical materials, this SBIR will investigate
 materials fabrication techniques that enable the control of the real
and imaginary linear and nonlinear indices in three dimensions.
DESCRIPTION:  The Materials and Manufacturing Directorate of the Air
Force Research Laboratory has an interest in developing materials for
nonlinear optics applications. Current solid state nonlinear optical
materials consist of a monolithic polymer or sol-gel chemistry-based
prepared as a slab or step concentration gradient. These materials
contain a uniform dispersion of a nonlinear optical material or a
semiconductor.  The materials respond to laser radiation by various
mechanisms including multiphoton absorption, nonlinear refraction,
nonlinear absorption and free carrier effects.  Examples of these
nonlinear optical materials are two-photon-absorbing dyes, polymers like
 poly(phenylene vinylene), phthalocyanines, platinum acetylides,
semiconductor dispersions and quantum dots. Problems with system
integration result from linear loss, optical aberrations, laser damage,
thermal lensing, formation of scattering centers and excimer formation.
Thus, these materials do not perform well in real world optical systems.
 Improvement of performance and system integration requires invention of
 materials that have enhanced nonlinear optical response via custom
engineered nonlinear light propagation capability in three dimensions.
The ability to control the real and imaginary components of the linear
and nonlinear refractive index would give the designer additional
freedom to achieve system integration. This SBIR will fund research on
methods for preparing nonlinear gradient index optical materials with
the capability of three-dimensional control of the real and imaginary
linear and nonlinear indices of refraction, including the fabrication of
 axial index gradients, radial index gradients and combination
gradients. This capability would make possible optical designs far
beyond what can be done today with monolithic elements. Specific
applications include design of a multilens system in one element,
waveguides, optical interconnects, tailor-made optical elements with
designed concentration gradients in three dimensions, management of
thermal lensing and optimizing the focal volume. Technologies like
multilayer processing, three dimensional laser lithography, ink jet
printing and aerosol jet printing make possible fabrication of these new
 optical elements. Currently it is feasible to fabricate GRIN optics by
multilayer processing. It is also feasible to prepare axial
concentration step gradients composed of machined polymer slabs. The
next step is to prepare a nonlinear optical element with a designed
three-dimensional nonlinear index gradient.  A fundamental problem with
fabricating these materials is inventing techniques to prepare a
three-dimensional array of submicron-sized voxels each having a
user-specified composition and XYZ coordinate. The performance of a
material in an optical system is strongly influenced by the
specifications of the optical system. These methods will improve system
integration by making possible system-specific optical element design.
An example of a cylindrical optical element that could be prepared by
this technique would be composed of a mixture of a linear optical
polymer with a nonlinear optical polymer. Example specifications are
length = 1 mm, diameter = 1 cm, parabolic radial nonlinear index
gradient with nonlinear optical susceptibility at the center = 1000x
that of silica. Deliverables include optical slabs with designed
concentration gradients in three dimensions similar to a Wood lens and
an all-in-one optical system composed of linear and nonlinear elements.
Final success of this technology would involve design of a nonlinear
optical system by beam propagation modeling, fabrication and proof of
concept by measurement of the beam profile entering and exiting the
system.      PHASE I:  Prepare a cylindrical (1 cm diameter x 1 mm
thickness) solid state nonlinear GRIN lens with a parabolic radial
nonlinear index gradient. The difference in third order susceptibility
between the center and edge should be 1,000x that of silica. The lens is
 a three-dimensional array of sub-micron scale voxels having specific
XYZ coordinates and mixtures of a linear and nonlinear optical material.
 .       PHASE II:  The Phase II research program will build on the
knowledge obtained in the Phase I program by fabricating gradient
optical systems with variation of the real and imaginary refractive
index in three dimensions. The research will demonstrate gradients
containing nonlinear materials including chromophores, nonlinear
polymers, semiconductor quantum dots and two photon absorption
materials. Deliverables of the materials will be provided to AFRL for
linear and nonlinear optical characterization       PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: The Phase III research program will focus on fabrication
of optical elements according to a design. The designs include
commercial devices like optical interconnects and waveguides. The
measured nonlinear optical performance of these elements will be
compared to beam propagation modeling data.",

        "topic_name": "Programmable Accelerated Environmental Test
System for Aerospace Materials",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a programmable materials
test apparatus that can reliably control simulated environmental
conditions.       DESCRIPTION:  Compliance with ASIP (Aircraft
Structural Integrity Program), specifically the five tasks stated in
MIL-STD-1530C, including establishment of a corrosion control program
(Task I) and corrosion assessment (Task II), is mandatory for all USAF
aircraft weapon system programs. However, there are currently no design
trade tools available to the ASIP community to account for the effects
of corrosion protection materials and processes, particularly outer mold
 line organic coatings, in an effective manner analogous to the way
fatigue is accounted for using damage tolerance models for crack growth.
 This goal is made more challenging because increasingly stringent
environmental regulations are restricting the materials that can be used
 on aircraft e.g. hexavalent chromium, while at the same time the
service life of some aircraft platforms have been extended far beyond
what was intended for the original design. This necessitates
consideration of emerging coatings which can have an array of corrosion
inhibition mechanisms (e.g., Mg-rich Zn primer). Currently, ASTM B 117
(5% NaCl neutral salt spray at 35degreesC) is used as the standard test
method for coated aluminum substrates, but is not viable for evaluating
the emerging coatings because it often yields an inaccurate or
misleading prediction of in-service performance. This is most likely
because ASTM B117 does not expose test articles to combinations of
environmental factors that lead to degradation of materials in service.
    The apparatus to be developed in this program is needed so that new,
 more accurate accelerated test methods can be created to advance the
development of environmentally compliant coatings for corrosion
protection by facilitating rapid performance analysis of new materials.
The apparatus must be able to apply and control the following
conditions: salt spray with ability to alternate between 3 or more
electrolyte solutions (NaCl, CaCO3, NaHCO3, etc.) during the same test,
temperature (-65degreesF to 250degreesF), pressure monitoring, relative
humidity (up to 100%, variability +\/- 5%), and irradiation using an
energy spectrum close to that of natural sunlight, with higher than
natural spectral irradiance up to 50 W\/cm2 in the UVA range (320-400
nm). The apparatus must also be able to apply and control ozone, CO2,
and at least one other interchangable background gas during operation.
The ozone concentration range must be 30 ppb minimum up to 30 ppm
maximum with variability +\/- 5% and ozone monitoring sampling rate of
30 Hz. The CO2 and other background gases must be regulated, i.e. using
mass flow control. The test apparatus must have user-friendly,
software-programmable control on\/off for all environmental conditions
as well as feedback sensors that detect the flow of ozone and
automatically shut off and vent the chamber if a valve or seal fails.
The applied environmental conditions must be uniform over the area
containing the test articles. It is desirable for the system to include
the ability to perform cyclic mechanical loading within the test
chamber.  It is also desirable to be able to monitor material properties
 of the test articles (e.g., electrochemical processes, elemental
composition, optical characterization) in situ during testing using
contact and non-contact methods and apply statistical algorithms to
collected data to identify significant interactions between applied
environmental conditions.       PHASE I:  Prove feasibility by design
and construction of durable small-scale prototype chamber that can
subject a planar area of approximately 1 ft2 to the required
environmental conditions and associated tolerances listed in the above
description. State plans for inclusion of mechanical loading, material
property monitoring, and data analysis.  Demonstrate prototype software
user interface for control of environment.      PHASE II:  Design and
construct durable full-scale test chamber capable of subjecting a planar
 area approximately 6-10 ft2 to the required environmental conditions
and associated tolerances listed in the above description.  Incorporate
cyclic mechanical loading, material property monitoring, and data
analysis if applicable.  Demonstrate software user interface for
controlling all environmental parameters.  Deliver prototype system with
 software to AFRL.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III
commercialization opportunities abound with aerospace equipment
manufacturers, coating formulators, and DoD laboratories. In addition to
 aerospace, the technology will be directly applicable to facilities and
 infrastructure protective coating testing and qualification.",

Impregnation Level",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a standard test method to
quantitatively validate prepreg resin impregnation levels with improved
fidelity as compared to current practice for better material and process
 control in the manufacturing environment.       DESCRIPTION:  The resin
 impregnation level is important to downstream processing of the
prepreg\/tape lay-up material and the resultant composite part quality
because of its affect on prepreg lay-down efficiency and air\/volatile
evacuation prior to and during the composite cure cycle. Partial
impregnation is a common practice used to manufacture prepreg materials
for the defense industry while full impregnation is used for automated
tape materials. The products are used on multiple DoD aircraft platforms
 to benefit part quality through improved process-ability. Air transport
 occurs via different mechanism depending on the product form (dry
mid-plane of prepreg verses interstitial gap in tow\/tape placement).
Successful air evacuation is especially vital to new generation, vacuum
bag only (atmospheric pressure only) cured systems. Improved
process-ability translates to improved repeatability and generally
improved mechanical performance. This effort will focus on the
development of a standard test method which will measure the level of
resin impregnation into a fiber bed during prepregging. Current,
state-of-the-art test methodologies correlate water uptake levels with
fiber bed free volume in a partially impregnated prepreg material. The
accuracy\/repeatability of this technique is estimated to be +\/-5%. A
test method with an accuracy of +\/-1% is desired to provide composite
part fabricators and end users with better confidence in their raw
materials, products, and reduced manufacturing cost of quality by
enabling material specifications to incorporate prepreg batch acceptance
 requirements for impregnation level.       PHASE I:  The Phase I effort
 would include the development of methods to quantify level of
impregnation (LOI) along with experimental validation proving
feasibility. A down-select to the most promising and industry practical
method is desired. Develop a preliminary transition plan including test
method specification acceptance.       PHASE II:  Phase II would focus
on developing and building a prototype measuring device and developing
American Standard Test Method (ASTM) or similar test method guideline.
The effort would include demonstration of the selected technique for
measuring LOI with a +\/-1% accuracy for prepreg and automated
tape-grade materials at the material or part supplier. Refine transition
 plan.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III would involve
commercialization of the product and LOI method. Demonstration that this
 method is able to quantitatively measure the LOI in prepreg batches for
 supplier part quality correlation would be desired. Submission to ASTM
committee for new standard acceptance is expected.",

controlled wrench capable of installing commonly used aircraft nuts and
collars. The device should be capable of measuring the number of exposed
 threads and informing the user of improperly installed fasteners.
 DESCRIPTION:  Aircraft manufacturing involves the installation of
thousands of a variety of fasteners critical to the structural integrity
 and performance of the airframe and has strict quality control
requirements. Current Air Force acquisition programs have numerous
Critical to Quality (CTQ) features for fastener installation that
require careful visual and manual inspection and measurements to ensure
compliance with engineering specifications. These aircraft inspection
and measurement methods are very labor intensive. Because of the large
volume of fasteners involved, many hours are needlessly spent conducting
 post-installation inspections of aircraft fasteners that are already
compliant with fastener installation requirements.       The objective
of this effort is to develop an intelligent, hand held smart wrench
system capable of installing a variety of structural aircraft nuts and
collars and measuring and storing installation inspection\/measurement
results. Aircraft manufacturers and Air Force systems would benefit from
 a system capable of real-time manipulation and feedback. The system
should be capable of installing commonly used nuts and collars during
the assembly process for current manufactured AF aircraft systems. The
system should have the ability to swage the Alcoa Eddie Bolt 2 eddie nut
 shown in the reference section. The system should have the ability to
measure post-installation fastener thread protrusion to the nearest
0.0083 inch, to store and deliver data and installation reports
compatible with OEM data storage systems, and immediately inform the
user of any fastener installation corrective action that is required.
The system should be configured to provide a logical user interface and
calibration procedures should be straightforward and quickly performed.
The prototype should be robust and maintain operability in an
environment where the unit could be inadvertently dropped from heights
of up to 5 feet with no adverse impact on system capability.
Because the system will be used in a variety of different structural
configurations, it will be critical for potential offerors to work
closely with an aircraft original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and a
working relationship already established with an OEM is preferred.
 The overall goal of this SBIR project is to deliver a mature prototype
unit to an Air Force approved OEM that provides specified requirements
capabilities at an affordable cost of no more than $2500 \/ unit. The
Phase I effort should focus on demonstration of the hand held proof of
concept. The Phase II effort should focus on optimizing the Phase I
design, developing an acceptable user interface and calibration tools,
designing a system that is applicable for use in the necessary
structural configurations, hardening the system against inadvertent
drops and demonstrating that the system meets TRL-7 and MRL-7
requirements. Periodic technology and manufacturing readiness level
assessments should be incorporated into this project.      PHASE I:  The
 focus of Phase I effort is the demonstration of a proof of concept hand
 held system on actual aircraft fastener parts. Perform initial business
 case analysis, manufacturing assessment, and transition plan.
PHASE II:  Develop prototype unit based on the Phase I development and
results. Deliver a prototype and perform initial field testing in
coordination with an aircraft OEM. Demonstrate system operability to
TRL-7 and MRL-7. Based on test results, identify and perform, if
possible, all required iterative modifications. Update the business case
 analysis and manufacturing\/transition plan.      PHASE III DUAL USE

Line Treatment Materials",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a repeatable and accurate
test fixture, testing methodology, and data collection protocol to
assess the durability of outer mold line treatment stack-ups applied to
external joints of a high performance fighter and\/or bomber aircraft.
       DESCRIPTION:  Fifth-generation fighters and modern bombers
require materials that can withstand joint flexure without cracking,
shrinking or thermally expanding over the life of the aircraft. When
damaged, current material systems require extensive maintenance
man-hours resulting in high rates of aircraft downtime. Although these
materials systems must pass'qualification'testing, the materials
continue to fail at high rates indicating insufficient and\/or
inadequate test protocol. Thus, a novel standardized test producing
accurate stress\/strain fields and realistic environmental conditions
for outer mold line (OML) treatment stack-ups is desired. Focus should
be placed on developing a novel, multi-configuration test fixture along
with testing methodology that simulates stress concentrations due to
geometry, tensile, compression, and shear fatigue mechanisms across
aircraft joints that occur around quick access, infrequent, and frequent
 access panels. The testing methodology should accurately simulate the
harsh environmental conditions, stresses, vibration, flexure and fatigue
 and aircraft's OML joints experience over the life cycle of the
aircraft. The proposed protocol must be performed as a laboratory test
that can be carried out with either standard or customized laboratory
equipment available at a reasonable cost. A single test fixture is
preferred, but multiple test fixtures to simulate the aforementioned
joint configurations is acceptable. The test fixture should accommodate
testing on an individual material as well as a multi-material stack so
conditions can be broadened\/focused as needed. The test method should
also address Coefficient Thermal Expansion (CTE) mismatch and thermal
expansion of coating materials in and over the joints. For CTE"s
evaluation, the substrates utilized should be constructed of
conventional aircraft materials (e.g. aluminum, carbon fiber and
titanium). Cycling of stresses and thermal loads is desired over a
temperature range of -65degreesF to 700 degrees F. An accurate in situ
determination of disbonds, cracking, delaminations and electrical
discontinuities is needed to determine material performance in real
time. The generation of materials property data, including hysteresis
and error is required. The test method should be as simple as possible
while able to be adjusted for a variety of simulated flight
environments, profiles, and ground conditions. Utilizing aircraft
manufacturers to assist in providing information on current joint
geometries, methods and procedures is highly recommended. Researchers
should be familiar with current ASTM practices and procedures for
aircraft materials (see references).      PHASE I:  Demonstrate test
fixture(s), test methodology, and data collection protocol on COTS or
otherwise available materials under ambient conditions. Identify
improvements over current ASTM standards. Specify all COTS\/custom
equipment and software requirements. Demonstrate the operating envelope,
 reliability, and reproducibility of the fixtures and methodology.

 fixture(s), test methodology, and data collection protocol on materials
 stack-ups under variable conditions (temperature, pressure, humidity,

determine failure mechanism (disbonds, cracking, delaminations,
electrical discontinuities, etc.). Develop test bias, reliability and
reproducibility information. Refine transition plan.       PHASE III

 DESCRIPTION:  SAE AMS-C-27725 fuel tank coating is a proven technology
for inhibiting corrosion and microbial growth in aircraft structures
that are in contact with jet fuel. Hexavalent chromium, an ingredient in
 SAE AMS-C-27725 materials is an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
toxic material and a significant occupational health concern with
exposure limitations proposed by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA). In addition, the elevated heat curing of some
currently approved fuel tank coatings increases manufacturing costs and
is not feasible for field level repair. The use of currently approved
chromated and\/or heat cured fuel tank coatings is financially and
logistically cumbersome, affecting the aircraft throughout the entire

high-volume low-pressure spray equipment or a brush. The candidate

Evaluation (NDE) Process for Aerospace Materials",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate an automated
 technique to nondestructively measure and quantify location specific
grain sizes in metallic aerospace materials.       DESCRIPTION:  The
move toward lighter weight, higher performance components for Air Force
applications is driving designers toward the use of tailored
microstructures to provide the necessary location-specific properties
for materials like nickel and titanium. An example is the dual
microstructure engine disk, which contains a transition from fine grains
 at the bore to coarse grains at the rim. Similar desired properties
exist within other structural applications as well, including airframes.
 Critical to fielding such components is the ability to nondestructively
 inspect and evaluate the microstructure.      AFRL Materials and
Manufacturing Directorate is interested in the development of a
nondestructive evaluation system that can detect AND characterize this
tailored surface grain size distribution in aerospace nickel and
titanium alloys. For example, due to location-specific failure
mechanisms in nickel turbine engine disks, fatigue at the bore and creep
 at the rim, engine manufacturers have developed heat treatment methods
to tailor grain size, 5m-8m at the bore and 44m-70m at the rim1,2.
Failure may also initiate from the so-called"as large as"(ALA) surface
grains in the material so it is critical to know the location and size
of these type anomalies. In titanium alloys, clusters of similarly
oriented primary alpha grains, called microtextured regions, may span
length scales of several millimeters. Crack extension occurs easily in
these regions due to the lack of high angle grain boundaries leading to
reductions in fatigue life3. Because these microstructural anomalies
(large grains, microtextured regions) may occur at any arbitrary
location on the surface of a component, inspection approaches will need
to reliably and repeatably measure and record spatially resolved surface
 grain size and morphology. Current inspection techniques, including
eddy current and fluoro-penetrant, can be limited by geometry size and
complexity and do not provide the detailed quantitative picture of
surface morphology required to assess location specific grain sizes,
most notably in the grain size transition regions. Without an automated
solution, manual data collection to characterize the surface becomes
extremely costly and time consuming. Given the potential for large
quantities of production inspections, successful solutions must provide
high level quantitative imagery, including spatially resolved grain
orientation maps, and be cost and cycle time competitive with existing
inspection techniques.      For successful implementation of this new
capability, the offeror"s proposed detection and characterization
technique is required to be: noncontact (i.e. probes will not directly
touch the part being assessed); nondestructive; automated with minimal
manual intervention and reduced setup; integrate-able with
existing\/preferred fixturing and tooling; compliant with existing
industry inspection system requirements; and, able to record and store
data clearly indexed to the workpiece. In its final implementation
state, output from this inspection system must integrate with existing
data systems used for statistical process control analysis.       The
system should be capable of mapping the microstructure to a minimum
resolution of = 20 m and a desired resolution of = 7 m at a rate in
excess of 2,000 points per second on material with a maximum surface
roughness of 120 -inch RMS. The prototype system should be able to scan
flat, convex and concave surfaces and cover a part volume with
dimensions 36"x 36"x 18".  Scalability to encompass larger volumes is
desired but not required.      Successful approaches should stress not
only potential scanning technologies but equally, the data
interpretation algorithms\/methods development necessary to provide the
desired information regarding grain size and orientation distribution.
    PHASE I:  Develop and demonstrate the feasibility of the system
concept described above. Stress data analysis to characterize the
microstructure. System design should include analysis methods, software,
 hardware, and external interface components including assembly tooling
requirements and assessment of high-risk technologies required for
characterization of complex geometries at the desired resolution.
PHASE II:  Develop, integrate and demonstrate the critical components of
 the proposed system developed in Phase I, stressing system performance.
 Demonstration should include a representative inspection piece,
environment and set-up of the final product. Demonstration should
provide defined approaches to address complex geometry, surface
roughness variations, surface treatment variations, and assess the
effects of possible coatings. Develop to MRL 5-6 maturity, with systems
design &amp; implementation plans.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:

applications for military aircraft engines and structures. Once proven
in the military, the proposed technology will have similar commercial

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a computational design tool
for defining a surface treatment process to produce a desired shape
change in a complex, 3-dimensional part and to validate this model in a
representative environment.       DESCRIPTION:  Aircraft The fabrication
 of integral components is a machining-intensive process that employs
non-conventional machining at high material removal rates. One method is
 high speed milling (HSM), which combines high spindle speeds with high
feed rates to produce a high material removal rate. At the present time,
 one of the biggest limitations of HSM of integral structures is
distortion. Distortion results from changes in the residual stress state
 within the machined component. The removal of material originally
containing residual stresses causes the residual stresses to
re-distribute elsewhere within the component. In addition, the machining
 process itself induces additional residual stress.      Excessive
distortion is a significant concern for aerospace OEMs. Distortion can
lead to the introduction of excessive fit-up stresses during assembly,
can result in improper joints\/connections, and can result in parts
being scrapped. In certain instances, machine shops are allowed to use
mechanical means (e.g., plastic bending over a fixture) to rectify some
of the distortion. This can be effective, but is limited to use on
simple geometry and this approach is lacking in quality and
traceability. An improved process for correcting distortion (i.e.,
reshaping back within drawing tolerance) in complex aerospace parts
might result in significant cost savings to the aerospace industry.
 It is well established that compressive residual stresses provide
improved fatigue performance and damage tolerance enhancement. To take
advantage of this concept, many surface treatment processes have been
developed over the past 60+ years that are capable of imparting
compressive residual stress into the surface layer of a component. The
surface treatment processes vary in the amount of residual compressive
stress they impart (magnitude and depth) as well as many other factors
such as: cost, applicability to specific geometric features, and
traceability\/quality control.      When surface treatments are applied,
 the induced plastic deformation (which is the driver for compressive
residual stress) also causes distortion. In most cases this distortion
is an undesirable consequence that is managed by keeping the processed
region small or by having a very stiff part. In certain cases (e.g.,
shot peen forming, which is used to create curved thin panels for
aircraft wings) the distortion itself is the motivation for the use of
the surface treatment. The use of surface treatments for shaping of
parts is currently limited to pretty simple configurations due, in-part,
 to the difficulty of achieving a desired complex shape without a
computational model of the process.      Predictive software tools,
which are currently configured to solve the forward problem (solve for
distortion and residual stress based on a defined surface treatment
process\/area), could be adapted to solve the reverse distortion problem
 (solve for the surface treatment process\/area required to produce a
desired shape change). When properly developed, this would provide an
effective tool for the use of engineered residual stress for shaping
complex 3D parts.      The objectives of this program would be to
develop a computational design tool for defining a surface treatment
process to produce a desired shape change in a complex, 3-dimensional
part and to validate this model in a representative environment.
PHASE I:  The focus of Phase I effort is the demonstration of a proof of
 concept and development of the software tools that will be used to
compute the surface treatment needed to reshape the part to the desired
dimensions. A simulation of the developed software tools is desired in
Phase I.      PHASE II:  Develop prototype system based on the Phase I
development. Integrate 3-D scanning techniques that can used on the part
 to be reshaped, focusing on critical part interfaces. Use scan data to
determine required deformations. A total system demonstration is desired
 that will reshape a part using these parameters.  Optimization and
validation of the system shall be demonstrated to be effective in an
operational environment (TRL\/MRL 7).      PHASE III DUAL USE

field effect transistors (OFET) based on soft matter materials is of
interest for a variety of applications in chem-bio detection,
environmental monitoring, human performance monitoring and in future
platforms as an extension of the human skin for enabling man-machine

 in aqueous environments.      The goal of this topic is to develop a
scalable processing of OFETs with reliable and reproducible performance,
 with design\/manufacturing considerations to provide complete device
modules. The OFET must be stable in aqueous environments such as serum
or sweat, and be multi-use. The OFETs must be amenable to
biofunctionalization for the detection of peptides, protein or
metabolites in aqueous medium like sweat, saliva or serum. The device
must function in flow-through modules to allow for frequent sampling.
Approaches compatible with ligands such as antibodies, peptides and
aptamers as the biological sensing elements functionalized onto the
semi-conducting material are highly encouraged. The OFET platform must
be benchmarked with other state of the art technologies such as
CNT-FETs, ELISAs or other (bio)chemical approaches.      PHASE I:

packages are produced, and have many advantages over current
manufacturing methods. Traits including low-cost, ease of design and
customization, and flat production costs are just a few of the
advantages direct write technologies bring to the table [1]. While the
majority of current material development for direct write technologies
is focused on developing additive techniques for the production of
mechanical \/ structural parts, there is substantial interest in
utilizing these concepts for the production of functional components for
 electronic and photonic devices as well (a.k.a. opto-electronic
devices). This approach has already produced some notable successes,
such as in display and solar cell technology, where print technology has
 greatly simplified production processes, or allowed the use of
materials that have not been traditionally used [2, 3].  To date,
development efforts for direct write inks have been limited to metal
colloidal inks for conductive material fabrication towards electronic
and RF operation. These electronic ink materials are available
commercially off the shelf and investment strategies exist to enhance
the electronic ink material variety and robustness. As data routing and

 becoming ever-more critical to integrate with the electronic components
 to create more versatile opto-electronic devices to adequately meet
required data handling rates and other critical metrics such as heat
output and robustness [4]. However, there is an unmistakable deficiency
of available proven ink materials to fabricate the necessary photonic

is to develop ink materials and associated processes which can be

infrared sources and detectors via techniques compatible with

 and present solutions to enable moving today's structural design
paradigm from the use of materials as fixed design inputs (i.e. lookup
table property values tied to existing fixed processes) to actual active
 variables in structural design (Ref 1). The ultimate vision would be
the evolution of design practice to the point that structural design
would drive materials requirements and real-time exploration of
materials\/compositions\/processing options that can and will be
adjusted in the same vein as the current design community's alteration
of shape to accommodate loads requirements (Ref 2). The objective of
this SBIR is to identify potential solutions and ultimately develop
methodologies and software approaches to integrate materials science and
 engineering (process, microstructure, and performance) model

replacements for today's"lookup table"datasets. The SBIR will explore
means of integrating with and potential required modifications of
existing commercially available finite element analysis software such as
 ABAQUS, ANSYS, NX Nastran etc. (which are the current standard design

this task (Ref 3). As necessary, the SBIR will identify and develop (as
necessary) high-level methods and computational algorithms to

potential solutions from\/through the commercial finite element codes.
Furthermore, the SBIR must address the Air Force's need to utilize

DESCRIPTION:  The SBIR will develop an advanced test capability for
measuring sub-scale components under propulsion service environments to
include high temperature and loading conditions within a sub-scale spin
test environment. The capability will capture the complete test
environment, including ability to operate under controlled atmospheric

crucial for determining load conditions and mechanical response under

 modeling material and component response and for evaluating coating and
 advanced material behavior prior to full component testing. In
addition, the research will develop computational models of material
performance for design integration, including the modeling of mechanical
 properties currently unavailable due to power constraints associated
with full spin tests at atmospheric conditions.      Specifically, the
test capability will measure multi-axial stress states in metallic
components subjected to sub-scale spin tests. Advanced finite element
models will be used to verify and validate test results, and to model
the mechanical response of test samples. The models will incorporate
relevant microstructural features as warranted to provide for
optimization of site specific features and graded structures. The
resulting information will be provide integrated computational materials

enhanced search and identification. Generate actionable data product for
 warfighter applications.       DESCRIPTION:  The Air Force needs
improved real-time imaging and data integration capabilities for
targeting pods and turreted systems such as the Northrop Grumman
AN\/AAQ-28 Litening targeting pod. Multispectral imaging provides the
means to find and characterize sensed objects within a relatively large
search area. 3-D ladar can provide means for precision geolocation,
target background segmentation, and aid in target identification.
Integrating 3-D ladar data with multispectral and other sensing
phenomenologies currently requires substantial processing capabilities
and time. Bandwidth limitations of communications links such as Common
Data Link (CDL) further limit the ability to transfer large datasets in
real time. A new capability is needed to provide real-time ladar and
electro-optical signal processing, data integration, geo-referencing,
and product development for both remote and urban datasets.     Geiger
Ladar systems collect large data sets which require substantial
processing time and are typically processed post flight. Current systems
 can require processing to collection ratios of two to five to provide a
 viable data product, which is typically performed post flight. Linear
mode systems can experience similar delays when imaging areas larger
than the sensor field of view. Overlay of passive imagery or
electro-optic imagery requires additional processing and system
knowledge to account for image distortions. Registration of ladar data
as collected from a moving platform requires sufficient knowledge of
system and environmental parameters to perform real-time processing.
System characterization should be known in order to sufficiently
compensate for system timing issues, boresight errors of laser with
receiver, quantify detector noise, and determine detector saturation.
Processing methods should correct for image striations, intensity based
corrections, feature based transformations, and registration anomalies,
including multiple surface returns.     This solicitation seeks the
development and demonstration of algorithms and processing methods
needed to achieve real-time presentation of collected flight data and
information gained by multimodal analysis. The processing methods should
 be capable of registering data from a small format Geiger or linear
mode arrays and rendering in a wide area map. These methods should
compensate for the fast quenching of photon-counting detectors, as well
as linear-mode detectors. The effort will lead to real-time generation
of 3-D information for user display as applicable to warfighter
applications. Integration of electro-optic, navigation information, and
visible imagery as collected from an aerial fixed wing platform at
operational altitudes. Generation of lower density products for
transmission is also needed. This effort will improve the processing to

(NIR-SWIR) HSI systems measure reflected solar illumination and are
limited to daytime use. Broadband laser illuminators (BLIs), combined
with a NIR-SWIR HSI scanning receiver would support day and night
operations. A BLI allows innovative processing and illumination modes
(e.g., laser only, or simultaneous or sequential laser and solar).
Existing HSI systems are used for near-nadir wide-area search, but a BLI
 may allow for long-range cued modes. This topic will develop an HSI
active transceiver and processing\/calibration methods to demonstrate
day\/night hyperspectral imaging in the NIR-SWIR at moderate ranges to
support future work towards a full-scale, long-range system.      Along
with the challenges of developing a high-powered BLI, there are
challenges associated with developing an appropriate HSI receiver,
scanner, and processing methodology, which is the primary focus of this
topic. BLIs produce a spot size that varies with wavelength;
additionally, atmospheric turbulence will impact the ground irradiance
distribution. The HSI receiver and processing must be able to
effectively calibrate\/compensate for these artifacts.  The transceiver
shall provide ground coverage rates of 4000-5000 m2\/sec (Phase II)(O);
and 65,000-75,000 m2\/sec in Phase III (T).  System operation should
support existing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR)
concepts of operation (CONOPs). New CONOPs that may be enabled by an
active HSI system should be considered.      The system requires
spectral response from 1.4 to 1.8 microns (T) to 1.0 to 2.5 microns
(exclusive of absorption bands) (O), a nominal spectral resolution of
10nm (T), and a Ground Sample Distance of 1m (T), 0.5m (O). Laser
irradiance normal to the line-of-sight shall approximate the irradiance
produced by the sun at zenith in the receiver band(s) (T). The system
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) must be sufficient to differentiate between
similar spectral targets (T), provide an average SNR of 30 (O) for
man-made targets. The system shall provide a day\/passive mode of
operation (T). Scan accuracy and repeatability shall allow for
georegistration of the data cube with topographic data (georegistration
need not be demonstrated in a Phase II effort). The design shall provide
 for a moderate-range and power transceiver for data collection and
algorithm development in Phase II and be expandable to a long-range,
militarily useful system in a Phase III effort. The system shall meet
the thresholds or objectives at a nominal 2 km slant range and operate
from 1 to 3 km slant range with degraded performance (T). The 2 km
imaging geometry will support tower-to-ground (100-300 foot sensor
elevation above ground level) (T), and mountaintop-to-ground (1000-2000
foot sensor elevation above ground level) (O) scenarios. The system
shall operate in a moderately turbulent atmospheric environment (Cn2 =
10e-14 (O)). Atmospheric path transmission may be predicted for the
Phase II and III efforts using the US Standard atmosphere, mid-latitude
summer, 23 km visibility modeling parameters (T). Operation at 5 km

up to 50,000 to 60,000 foot slant-path narrow-area cued modes,
selectable\/multiple GSDs, a two-band (within the 1.0 to 2.5 micron
NIR\/SWIR band), 1000 watts\/micron illuminator, operation in 2x
Hufnagel-Valley model turbulence, and size, weight, and power (SWAP)
consistent with a 24- to 28-inch airborne turret or pod.      PHASE I:
This phase will develop architectures for the Phase II\/III
transceiver(s) comprising a BLI, receiver, scanning system, optics, and
processing. The offerer shall optimize the source, scanner, and receiver
 to provide useful and programmable ground coverage. The effects of
backscatter and turbulence shall be considered.       PHASE II:  Design,
 fabricate, integrate and test a 2 km-range prototype. Provide an
Interface Control Document (ICD) and source data to support a laser
safety permit. Incorporate ANSI and OSHA requirements for laser sources.
 The Phase II prototype hardware will be robust enough to undergo
laboratory and tower testing. A complete transceiver is deliverable
under this phase. Final testing will be conducted at a government
facility supporting the required evaluation of performance.       PHASE
III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: A Phase III transceiver would provide
long-range, day\/night identification of military-specific materials. A

 technology combining passive adaptive optics with computational
techniques.       DESCRIPTION:  Air Force high and medium altitude
intelligence surveillance reconnaissance (ISR) imaging sensor range and
resolution have long been affected by atmospheric effects. Application
of new technology and techniques are expected to solve these limitations
 enhancing future A2\/AD applications. Key is to implement this
technology through processing modifications and minor upgrades to the
Air Force's (AF) inventory of airborne sensors.       Conventional image
 techniques are inadequate for extending the useful range of passive
optical sensors.  Phenomena, such as atmospheric transmission, scatter,
dispersion, and turbulence limit and systems capabilities. Advances in
adaptive optics have shown that much can be done to mitigate atmospheric
 turbulence. However, many techniques employ a laser-generated guide
star, or other active sensing technique to measure the impact of
turbulence along the imaging path. Passive techniques are more desirable
 to the AF due to their inherent covertness.     Computational imaging
has shown promise for improving system performance. The intensive
computational burden associated with current techniques may reduce or
even eliminate any system volume savings and add additional system power
 consumption. Mathematical image processing techniques, such as"blind
deconvolution"and"luck look,"have also shown promise for mitigating
turbulence. However, they can be slow and require considerable
computational support to execute.     An investigation of a union of
computational imaging and passive adaptive optics techniques to overcome
 limitations due to atmospheric turbulence is desired. The greatest
challenge is that the combination of the two technologies has yet to
show an improvement in imaging performance over computational techniques
 alone. Approaches must be a combination of optical hardware and image
processing software. Software only or processor hardware only approaches
 are not desired and will be considered non-responsive. Systems shall
operate in"real time"(10 frames per second minimum, with 60 frames per
second and higher desirable) but also improve still images. The
technology developed shall be able to be integrated into existing,
legacy imaging systems with as little effort as possible. Some allotment
 for space, weight, and power in system integration must be made.
Systems minimizing the integration impact are preferred. Technical
approaches shall function in atmospheric windows between 0.38 and 2.5
microns in wavelength. The goal shall be to operate across as broad a
spectral bandwidth as possible. The ability of the system to mitigate
turbulence and recover useful imagery shall exceed the ability of blind
deconvolution techniques when run on the same data at the same frame
rate using similar processing hardware.     Sensor observation ranges
and altitudes of interest are those relevant to the A2\/AD environment
(at least 80 km slant range and 35,000 ft above sea level). Hufnagel
Valley (5\/7) turbulence in conjunction with a"mid-latitude
summer"atmosphere will be considered a minimum the approach shall
mitigate. Imagery through turbulence will not be provided by AF. The
offerer will need to show the ability to simulate or have access to
appropriate imagery collected at relevant ranges and through levels of
atmospheric turbulence. If the offerer proposes the use of real imagery,
 they must provide detailed information about the atmospheric conditions
 under which the imagery was captured (including but not limited to
date, time, location, weather, and some measurement of turbulence).
Sensor parameters relevant to the analysis include an 11-inch aperture, a
 1-degree field of view, and a 1-meter ground resolved distance.
PHASE I:  Concept refinement and high fidelity theoretical analysis.
This analysis shall show that the prototype will meet the requirements
outlined above.       PHASE II:  Detailed design and prototype
fabrication. The prototype shall be robust enough for laboratory and
limited field testing.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Install
prototype system in operationally representative aircraft and

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate
revolutionary technologies for shared aperture non-mechanical steering
of 3D LADAR for target acquisition, identification, and tracking which
steer SWIR LADAR imagery while passing MWIR for FLIR sensors.
DESCRIPTION:  3D-Laser Detection and Ranging (LADAR) sensor can provide
an image to help identify a target hidden in camouflage or ground
clutter. 3D information provides clutter separation, adjustable view
angles and other cues to isolate and identify targets. Range separation
also allows use of energy that"pokes through"gaps in camouflage or
foliage. The primary aperture on Electro-Optic (EO) sensor platforms can
 support both ShortWave InfraRed (SWIR) and MidWave InfraRed (MWIR)
sensors. One sensor configuration has a MWIR Forward Looking InfraRed
(FLIR) camera coupled with a SWIR 3D-LADAR. Due to lower pixel counts,
the 3D-LADAR has a restricted Field of View (FOV) to provide enough
resolution for identification. The Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for
this system enables a pilot to designate a target from the FLIR, track
and image the target with the FLIR at boresight and use a 3D-LADAR for
enhanced identification. An improvement to this system adds a
non-mechanical steering element to provide the 3D-LADAR unrestricted
access to the FOV of the FLIR, which also gives random access to
3D-LADAR steering and the potential for simultaneous multiple target
designation and tracking. A revolutionary approach is to eliminate the
need for the 3D-LADAR to be constrained to the pointing direction of the
 gimbal. A non-mechanical beam steering (NMBS) device located at the EO
aperture would be able to steer outside of the field of regard (FOR) of
the telescope. Such a system provides advances in the capabilities of
the EO sensor by allowing the LADAR to operate semi-independently of the
 FLIR. Independent operations would allow the 3D-LADAR to perform
automated functions when not actively engaged with the pilot. The most
obvious benefit is that with a wider FOV than the telescope, the
3D-LADAR can track targets even as they leave the FOR of the telescope. A
 more important advantage is that the 3D-LADAR could continue to collect
 data even as the primary gimbal is re-tasked. This allows the 3D-LADAR
to aggregate data from multiple look angles, enhancing the 3D imaging by
 illuminating shadowed regions and forming a more complete
representation of the target. In wide area 3D imaging, this system
improves the area coverage rate by using less mechanical steering which
has unusable non-linear regions at the edges of rotation.     Commercial
 3D mapping would benefit from multi-spectral capability and increased
area coverage rate.     Current NMBS devices are",

Autonomous System Mission Capabilities",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Aircraft system applications need
5-10 times the computational power currently available. Achieving
autonomous operation will require enhanced computing that is resource
efficient, flexible, &amp; provides guaranteed capability to ensure
mission success.       DESCRIPTION:  Intelligence, Surveillance, and
Reconnaissance (ISR) assets continue to expand the amount of data
collected as sensor technologies improve. They also tend to be smaller,
unmanned systems. These conditions require solutions to the problems of
transmitting data\/information to ground control stations through data
links or post-processing raw data into some smaller packages of
information on-board. There is a proven value in having real-time or
near-real-time interpretation of sensor data. This enables actions to be
 initiated in a timelier manner. Focusable compute power of this nature
can enhance the autonomous capability of systems particularly those
guided by a distant operator.      Previous efforts have addressed the
data transmission issue. However, these communication pipelines cannot
be expanded enough nor can the raw data be compressed enough to solve
the problems. Identified solutions were not amenable to retrofitting
existing systems and would have to wait for the next new system.
This SBIR will focus on the on-board compute environment and assume that
 the existing external communication links will be used.  A cloud-like
computing environment should enable flexible application of processing
power to multiple needs and platforms. Different mission legs have
different computational requirements. The virtual nature of the cloud
should permit addressing these requirements as they dynamically arise
during any mission.     A cloud-like capability could combine the best
of traditional embedded systems with cloud-like capabilities such as
those available in today"s high-performance ground based computer.
Issues that need to be addressed include (but are not limited to):

minimum, fabrication of a representative prototype of the concept to

multispectral infrared (IR) imager that produces real-time spectral
video and is compact compared to current optical systems.
DESCRIPTION:  This topic seeks to develop a long focal length,
multispectral IR imager that produces real time spectral video (25 to 30
 Hz video frame rate) and is compact compared to current optical systems
 (less than 25lbs). The imager should have a minimum 256 x 256 pixel
spatial resolution, four (4) or more spectral colors, minimum of 100 mm
focal length, and operate at or near video frame rates. Current IR
multi-spectral imagers are large and difficult to integrate on small
size, weight, and power (SWaP) limited platforms, such as Puma, Shadow,
and Tube Launched Expendable UAS (TLEU). The deficiency of these imagers
 is their large optical systems which are needed to simultaneously
collect both the spatial and spectral data. The optics often form&gt;90
percent of the total system size. In addition, as the wavelength range
and spectral resolution of the imager increases, so does the imager
volume. Recently, fabrication techniques have been developed to produce
high performance micro-optical elements, such as lenses, filters,
gratings and prisms. These micro-optical elements form the core of the
optical train for a multispectral imager and their incorporation into a
system would vastly reduce the overall system size.  Multispectral IR
imagers that are available with small SWaP are limited to short focal
lengths, restricting their suitability for long range intelligence
surveillance reconnaissance (ISR).     Multispectral IR imagers are
required that can support long-range ISR applications, while maintaining
 their compact features. Government materials, equipment, data, or
facilities are not required.      PHASE I:  Develop a preliminary design
 of the long focal length, compact, multispectral IR imager that
includes all of the relevant sensor parameters. Conduct a study that
describes the expected sensor performance based on these parameters. The
 sensor parameters and study should be of sufficient detail that a
customer will be able to determine the compatibility of the sensor
approach to their application.      PHASE II:  Build a prototype long
focal length, compact, multispectral imager that operates in an infrared
 wavelength band with military relevance and demonstrate performance in
simulated operational environment. The imager should have a minimum 256 x
 256 pixel spatial resolution, four (4) or more spectral colors, minimum
 of 100 mm focal length, and operate at or near video frame rates.

Varying Illumination Conditions and Viewing Geometry",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate
hyperspectral processing algorithms capable of detection and
reacquisition of user-designated surface targets on land (or sea) under
various illumination\/atmospheric conditions with varying sensor\/target
 viewing geometries.       DESCRIPTION:  HSI sensors have the unique
ability to identify objects on the earth"s surface based on their unique
 material composition. This may allow detection of designated targets
among objects that appear similar to the naked eye. Users of
hyperspectral imagery products have a requirement to detect movements of
 designated targets using subsequent images collected hours to days
later. Therefore, a target selected for discrimination in an initial
image should be identifiable if it appears in subsequent images, even
with changing atmospheric\/illumination conditions and under varying
observation geometries. Observed target spectral signatures can vary
significantly for non-Lambertian objects, such as vehicles, making
target detection and\/or reacquisition challenging when illumination
conditions and\/or viewing geometry changes exist between successive
images.     Two separate problems should be examined for this effort. In
 the first problem, the user estimates\/extracts a target signature from
 the scene itself. This signature must then be used to reacquire the
same target in subsequent images that may have differences in viewing
geometry and\/or illumination. The second problem would incorporate a
priori bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)
information into the detection\/reacquisition algorithms using physical
models that can incorporate the BRDF information to achieve improved
target detection performance over baseline algorithms that assume
Lambertian targets. Additionally, the subsequent images could be
acquired by different hyperspectral sensors that may have differences in
 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), spectral sampling, ground sample distance
(GSD), etc. To address this issue, the algorithms developed must
accommodate BRDF characteristics of the target and\/or develop methods
that are robust to changes in target spectral signatures resulting from
these BRDF effects.     The expected development program will make use
of available HSI sensor data to explore techniques and algorithms that
could enable detection and reacquisition of hyperspectral targets. It
would investigate the effects of changes to viewing geometry and target
illumination for target materials with reflectance\/emissivity
characteristics ranging from diffuse to specular.     Investigation of
procedures and algorithms for hand-off of targets from one HSI sensor to
 another is also of interest. A unique spectral signature may allow
operators to acquire and specifically identify a given target using more
 than one sensor. The algorithms developed for robust target
reacquisition must be able to accommodate differences in sensor
performance, such as spectral resolution, radiometric sensitivity and
calibration artifacts.      PHASE I:  Develop techniques and algorithms
for estimating user-designated target information (i.e., BRDF) from the
hyperspectral image itself and develop methods for reacquisition of the
target(s) in subsequent images. Demonstrate these techniques on existing
 HSI data.      PHASE II:  Further refine and develop those techniques
investigated during Phase I to apply to airborne imagery. Develop
techniques and algorithms capable of incorporating a priori BRDF
information into the detection and reacquisition of ground targets.
Develop and demonstrate an experimental HSI processing system, including
 a user interface that is easy to learn and operate. Demonstrate the
ability to do cross-sensor target reacquisition using airborne imagery.
     PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Further refine the Phase II
algorithms to produce a prototype HSI software application that can be
demonstrated with an operational air or ground system. The prototype
software application should be able to operate in real-time in

Unit for RF receive-only phased array to enable 8 simultaneous,
independent beams with high bandwidth and linearity, low loss,
sufficient delay resolution for scanning over +\/- 60 degrees  with
potential for reduced C-SWaP.       DESCRIPTION:  Applying new radio
frequency (RF) photonic technology to RF collection systems is expected
to increase performance by and order of magnitude while reducing Cost,
Size, Weight and Power (C-SWaP). Reducing payload C-SWaP is a key
objective of Air Force unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). Advances in RF
photonic signal processing techniques will allow high-performance RF
sensors to use the optical domain for a new generation of RF signal
distribution systems.      Simultaneous, multi-user, multi-target
tracking RF beamforming technology is a focus for advanced phased-array
sensor systems. Fiber-optic True Time Delay (TTD) and more recently the
use of optical Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) and Photonic
Integrated Circuits (PIC) for RF beamforming has been recognized as
having promise for realizing order of magnitude reduction in C-SWaP over
 electronic approaches, especially with regard to achieving a
simultaneous signal tracking capability for multiple high-gain RF beams.
      Continued advancement in RF photonic signal processing techniques
is needed in order for high-performance RF sensors to take advantage of
the optical domain provided by next-generation fiber-optic RF signal
distribution systems. This topic involves the study, design, and
development of a simultaneous, receive-only, multi-beam RF phased-array
Time Delay Unit (TDU) using PIC techniques. The emphasis is on
developing architectures and components that optimize simultaneous RF
beamforming for eight or more beams with a path toward achieving
performance goals needed for high performance sensor systems.
State-of-the-art electronic TDUs provide 11-bit TTD (from 2.5 to 511.75

 that photonic techniques provide for simultaneous RF beamforming. For
example, a variety of system demonstrations have employed photonic WDM

 even further C-SWaP reduction using PIC to optimize interconnects,

Force is interested in advancing methodologies that can accurately
predict reliabilities of an existing aging dormant weapon system and its
 LRU. Most particularly, we are interested in predicting when LRU
subsystems can be expected to wear out without any remedial action."Wear
 out"is when one can expect to see a significant increase in failure
rates and decrease in reliability. Knowing in advance of entering the
wear-out phase for subsystems can provide lead time for planning supply
chain upgrades and modifications to the system. This is very important
when considering systems that sit in storage for the majority of their
lifetimes and are required to operate at high reliabilities upon
immediate use. Nuclear cruise missiles may reside in a dormant state for
 many years within a needed service life of decades (approximately 30-50
 years) and then be required to operate with high reliabilities. The
typical environment is for a cruise missile to be stored in a
non-environmentally controlled facility for two years as part of a pylon
 or launcher package, minimally tested at two years as part of the
package, returned to storage for two more years, minimally tested again,
 returned to storage for two more years, then downloaded from the
package and undergo maintenance actions (like engine removal and
replacement, pyro change out), extensive system level testing, and
returned to storage to start the cycle again. Cruise missiles that
require minimum maintenance and inspection throughout their lifetimes do
 not have a methodology to properly predict the reliability of the
subsystems. LRUs are defined as separate boxes or items that have a

        "topic_name": "Advance Tracking Algorithms to Meet Modern
Threats",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Investigate and validate the use of
advanced non-linear, non-Gaussian tracking algorithms against targets
which are either supermaneuverable, have low radar cross section (RCS)
and\/or have high scintillation properties.       DESCRIPTION:  In the
first look, first kill environment against low radar cross section (RCS)
 targets, tracking ability becomes critical at longer ranges. You want
to be able to track at lower signal to noise ratios (SNR) while
minimizing the radar beam dwelling on your target. Being able to
accurately discriminate the position of a target is problematic in many
ways. Most tracking algorithms today work using various versions of the
Kalman Filter (KF). Velocity information is radial only, along the line
that extends from the radar to the target. Rapid changes in
acceleration, high-G turns, or rapid changes in RCS can bring about
large errors in the estimates of the tracking algorithm and cause the
radar to break lock. These pose problems to conventional trackers
because the movement is contrary to the linear motion models assumed by
the tracking algorithms. Rapid changes in acceleration can be caused by
nonlinear movements such as high alpha maneuvers known as
supermaneuverability. Supermaneuverability allows an aircraft to perform
 maneuvers beyond what is possible by pure aerodynamic forces. It is a
trait of some advanced fourth-generation and 4.5-generation fighter
aircraft which has become standard in fifth-generation aircraft. These
same maneuvers have the potential to cause break-locks of radar-guided
missiles by defeating conventional KF trackers assumption of linear
motion models. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are also highly
maneuverable and inherently smaller and harder to detect. UAVs have the
potential to pull upwards of 20 Gs as reported by several National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) UAVs.     KF is far from
perfect. It evolved at a time when computational power was limited and
it performed estimates using linear and Gaussian assumptions.
Computational power is no longer limited, but numerous new radars being
developed are still using KF for tracking while the target environment
has changed dramatically. The mathematical models, used in tracking
filters, have to make assumptions about the type of targets anticipated;
 approximations and unmodelled effects are inherent ingredients. The KF
is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient
computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a
 way that minimizes the mean squared error. The KF is very powerful in
several aspects, but the purpose of the filter in radar target tracking
is to estimate the state of linear systems using measurements containing
 random errors. However, RCS scintillation (large rapid changes in
signal to noise ratio) and supermaneuverability are not linear or
random.  RCS of some targets scintillates much more today than they did
years ago (target RCS can change by 30 db in a usec.). There are two
approaches that have progressively acquired the favor of scientists,
engineers and practitioners; they are the Unscented KF and the Particle
Filtering (PF). (Particle filters also known as Sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC), sequential importance re-sampling (SIR), bootstrap filters, Monte
 Carlo filters, and condensation filters.) PF has the advantage of being
 able to handle any functional non-linearity, and system or measurement
noise of any distribution. This approach and Track Before Detect (TBD)
is much more doable today given the higher sample rates and the
increased computational power available today.      PHASE I:  Evaluate
tracking algorithms for non-linear targets in non-Gaussian environment.

multi-hypothesis filters. Evaluate each approach against various

 Radar Architecture Upgrades",

digital converters (ADC), with higher sample rates and wider word
lengths, to improve radar detection. Explore architecture upgrades which
 will allow rapid insertion of faster ADC, processor, and bandwidth
technology.       DESCRIPTION:  In the first look, first kill
environment, detection range becomes critical when going up against
threats with comparable technology. You want to be able to detect at
lower signal to noise ratios (SNRs) while minimizing the beam dwell and
the transmitter power of your radar. The modern airspace today includes
advanced fourth- and fifth-generation aircraft which have more
maneuverable and lower radar cross section. Unmanned air vehicles and
unmanned combat air vehicles are also inherently smaller and harder to
detect and track.      Detection of small targets in the presence of
noise and clutter interference presents a formidable task in a radar
system design. The linear dynamic range of RF receivers is a limiting
factor in the performance of high-end military radar receiver. The
nonlinear distortion generated in the ADC and the analog receiver limits
 the capability of the backend radar signal processor. The next
generation of ADC from major vendors is expected to provide 300 Ms\/sec
with 16-bit resolution. In the commercial world, the status quo is
14-bit resolution, but in many military systems 10-12 bit is pushing and
 numerous new radar are only using 10 bits, as discussed in Military
Embedded Magazine. Those extra few dBs of resolution will enable
receivers, such as radars and Radar Warning Receivers, to perform more
effectively. Electronic intelligence (ELINT) equipment can take
advantage of the improved resolution to perform single emitter
identification more accurately and at greater range. The Electronic
Countermeasures world will be able to detect targets earlier and react
quickly to encountered threats, thereby improving the Probability of
Survival.     In any digitization process, the faster the signal is
sampled, the lower the noise floor. The faster a signal is sampled, the
lower the noise floor because the noise is spread over more frequencies.
 The noise floor (referenced to the full scale value of the ADC) is:
Noise Floor (dBFS) = 6.02 * Bits + 1.76 + 10 Log (Fs\/2). SNR of the ADC
 may be greatly improved by filtering just the bandwidth of the desired
signal. Therefore, the SNR is proportional to 10 Log (Fs\/Filter BW).
The greater the ratio between sample rate and filter bandwidth, the
higher the SNR.     Dynamic range is critical to increased radar
performance, especially in the case of passive target detection using
signals of opportunity. Transmitting any RF energy is dangerous in a
modern threat environment, so passive technology is becoming an emerging
 technology for airborne radars. Here dynamic range alone is critical in
 order to separate the much weaker reflected signal from the direct path
 broadcast signal of opportunity.     Various techniques can be
implemented to improve the sampling rate beyond the capability of a
single ADC semiconductor. Many techniques, such as interleaving ADCs,
stacked ADCs, and the use of nonlinear gain stage, were tried years ago
and have not been researched in the current environment of much faster
floating point Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), mezzanine cards,
faster data busses, and much faster multicore, parallel processors.
Interleaving ADCs and synchronizing them should be easier today given
the speed and gate count of modern FPGAs. Many of these other techniques
 were tried in the past because nothing else worked. Today, we need to
explore what can be done to maximize the sample rate, dynamic range, and
 upgradeability for modern airborne radars up against the new emerging
threats.      PHASE I:  Quantify the theoretical dependencies of ADC
sample rate and dynamic range on resolution, SNR, gain, and tracking
ability in various radar configurations. Evaluate sampling multiple
times per pulse using various waveforms and the impact on single pulse
Doppler determination, cross-correlation, unambiguous range,
de-ghosting, multi-path discrimination, and electronic protection.

community predict performance. Assess which sampling techniques for
transmitted and received waveforms are compatible with various radar
architectures. Evaluate various acquisition board architectures which
can keep pace with bandwidth and sample rate improvements. Recommend
novel architecture designs which will allow rapid insertion of faster

the number of channels in the RF receiver into a wideband receiver and

state-of-the-art analog-to-digital converter parts with an ENOB of 10

enhanced capabilities to the following digital baseband and MAC

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate a
compression algorithm for space IR data to maintain a numerically
lossless compression ratio of 8x or greater across the range of data
complexity, with computational efficiency in both orbital and handheld
processing systems.       DESCRIPTION:  While infrared (IR) space
surveillance data is typically very large (i.e., 4K x 4K focal plane
array whole earth stare), it must reach warfighters in the field quickly
 enough to remain actionable via a very narrow (56k) communication
channel. By implementing compression\/decompression algorithms that
achieve a minimum 8:1 numerically lossless compression ratio, it is
anticipated that a larger warfighter audience can be reached within
tactically relevant timeframes. Additionally, more data could be
delivered via the downlink while simultaneously reducing the required
bandwidth loads on the core Air Force network and communication assets.
     This solicitation seeks an innovative solution to achieve a minimum
 8x numerically lossless compression algorithm for space-based IR data
across a full range of data complexity. A full range of data complexity
may include differing resolution in either the spatial, temporal, or
spectral axes, and may include different scenes, rates, or modes of data
 collection. Dynamic range may span the very dim (i.e., below the
background level at night or against deep space) to the very bright
(i.e., nadir reflections). To be considered an innovative solution,
lossless compression performance must exceed the expected performance
that can be achieved via the JPEG 2000 data compression standard, given
applicable system limitations. The algorithm reconstruction must leave
no degradation in data quality.      An open architecture is desirable.
It is also necessary that the compression\/decompression algorithms be
computationally efficient in terms of processing and power consumption.
Since system implementation will occur via satellites and handheld
devices (both having stringent power and computer processing
limitations), size, weight and power (SWAP) considerations must be
paramount in any solution. Accordingly, the algorithms must be able to
complete compression using a satellite-class processing system and
decompression using a handheld processing system, all within a time
frame which would support appropriate responses to the IR data from a
warfighter. Anticipated solutions should be able to scale from 56 Kbps
all the way to 1,000 Mbps. The program also has requirements to use
rad-hard processors from a DoD-approved, trusted foundry. Therefore, the
 SBIR contractor must design and size algorithms and processing needs to
 fit on equivalent devices (i.e., typically with less than current
state-of-the-art performance).     Phase I work will be in the
unclassified domain. Simulated IR data will be supplied by SMC\/IS to
exercise and test algorithms. In order to proceed to Phase II, the small
 business doing this work must be certified for SECRET work. This
project is restricted to no foreign release.       PHASE I:  The Phase I
 work should include concept development, demonstration, and evaluation
of data compression algorithms against space-based infrared data.
PHASE II:  The Phase II effort should include
parametric"SWAP"trades\/considerations for space-based implementation
using trusted foundry processors. Phase II should include determination
and demonstration of"latency"requirements (i.e., time to compress and
decompress, given available computing power), and should include testing
 and demonstration of software after porting to relevant
hardware\/firmware applications. Phase II includes fabrication of a
representative prototype to demonstrate performance.       PHASE III
DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Turn-key IR specific compression algorithm source
 code (in compliance with DoD regulations), for use in a DoD system.

algorithms can be used for air or land based surveillance equipment and
may be useful for non-IR data.",

E-band (71-76 and 81-86 GHz) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and
digital-to-analog converters (DACs) suitable for satellite
communications application.        DESCRIPTION:  Over several decades
advances in miniaturization have caused breakthroughs in digital
microelectronics (notably ADCs and DACs), which promote system-on-chip
(SoC) solutions to radio frequency (RF) analog and digital
functionality. The recent rapid integration of mixed-mode
microelectronics has enabled communications systems programmability
through software or software radio (SR) to increasingly displace
conventional hardware-based radio systems. While satellite designers are
 typically confronted with a set of ambitious payload performance
requirements, limited launch vehicle lift capability constrains the
payload size, weight and power consumption. Improvements in affordable
mixed mode microelectronics device performance offer one means of
implementing SR, increasing the level of functionality of future
generations of communications satellites while meeting budget
constraints. Challenges facing analog\/mixed signal integrated circuit
designers include higher bandwidth and frequency ratios, form factor,
power consumption, and die area. Satellite communications (SATCOM)
mixed-mode applications are particularly acute in the area of front end
processing. E-band (71-76, 81-86 GHz) wireless systems offer higher data
 rates and long distance transmissions suitable for SATCOM. The goals of
 this topic are to develop ADCs and DACs to support RF front ends that
downconvert to baseband for SR in space applications. The specifications
 for these circuits include space-qualified ADCs or DACs that operate up
 to 1 GHz input bandwidth, resolution up to 12 bits, effective number of
 bits (ENOB) of 9 bits at 1 GHz, extended operating temperature range
(-40 to +80 deg. C), and 1 Mrad(Si) total dose radiation tolerance. A
trade study should include potential cost, size, weight and power
(C-SWAP) reductions for application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)

objectives include improved power efficiency, increased bandwidth,
reduced microcircuit footprint, reduced noise, and enhanced reliability.

traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) operating at 71 to 76 GHz, capable
of providing at least 100 Watts of output power and suitable for long
term geostationary earth orbit (GEO) missions.       DESCRIPTION:
Providing warfighters with a comprehensive understanding of battlefield
situational awareness depends on the timely delivery of the Airborne
Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (AISR) data. With
proliferation of new generations of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
platforms capable of hosting satellite communications payloads, it is
becoming increasingly advantageous to access additional spectrum in the
millimeter wave region to transfer high resolution AISR data between
UAVs and satellites. The development of a new generation of high power
TWTAs capable of accessing spectrum between 71 and 76 GHz will enable a
high data rate downlink from a satellite located in geostationary earth
orbit (GEO) to ground sites. The GEO satellite can be a high data rate
relay for beyond the line-of-sight (BLOS) communications between users
and one or more UAVs loitering above the weather. The Air Force is
interested in developing a new set of power amplifiers capable of
supporting future generations of bandwidth efficient modulation

range. Aside from raising the output power, the TWTA design should
strive to optimize self interference, adjacent channel interference,

minimize noise introduced during the signal amplification in satellite
low-noise amplifiers (LNA) operating between 20.2 to 21.2 GHz.
DESCRIPTION:  Signal noise poses a significant challenge to
long-distance satellite communications, impacting bit error rates, the
level of transmitter radiated power required to close the link, and,
indirectly, the payload size, weight and power. Ongoing research in
noise cancellation has demonstrated the use of noise cancellation to
enhance noise performance. The purpose of this topic is to develop
innovative low-noise amplifier (LNA) design techniques to cancel and
otherwise minimize noise introduced during the signal amplification
process.  Typically, each receive module has a LNA and a phase shifter
that have been integrated into one, or more, Monolithic Microwave
Integrated Circuits (MMICs). In order to increase receiver sensitivity
while reducing the power dissipation of the receiver, there is a
critical need to minimize additional noise introduced by the LNA while
maximizing power efficiency. While the dissipation in the LNA is a small
 fraction of the prime power consumption, the receive antenna generally
remains powered at all times, thus the power consumption in the receiver
 represents a critical power drain. Excessive LNA power increases
heat-load, which in turn, increases the required cooling of the receive
phased array antenna. Because LNAs play a critical role in high data
rate satellite warfighter communications, the Air Force is interested in
 sponsoring noise canceling research to both reduce noise figure and
power consumption with the prerequisite linearity to support bandwidth
efficient modulation waveforms like 16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
(QAM). This topic is intended to support research exploring the best
approach to achieving noise canceling with optimum linearity (measured
by the output third-order intercept point, or OIP3, across the frequency
 of operation) and demonstrate the level of performance that can be
achieved in low-noise amplifiers for satellite application at 20.2 to

        "topic_name": "Characterization of Atmospheric Turbulence for
Long Range Active Electro-Optic Sensors",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop methods and devices to
characterize atmospheric turbulence and its effects on the performance
of long-range active electro-optical sensors.       DESCRIPTION:
Atmospheric optical turbulence can have deleterious effects on the data
quality of active sensors. Most current turbulence measurement systems
give path integrated turbulence metrics (for example, atmospheric
coherence diameter). Some systems are able to characterize the
atmosphere at intermediate points along a path but are not well suited
to a dynamic flight environment. Active coherent laser sensors operating
 near the earth are more sensitive to atmospheric turbulence than
passive non-coherent imaging due to the cumulative effects of variations
 of piston, and their sensitivity to changes of the measured phase. A
full understanding of atmospheric optical turbulence, its spatial and
temporal coherence attributes and their effects on coherent laser radar
systems (e.g., scintillation, beam wander, beam breakup, etc.) is
desired to improve the performance of current and future intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) optical systems and their models.
 Without an in-situ measurement of the turbulence experienced by these
sensors, understanding their performance is difficult. Characterization
parameters measured in flight and along the line of sight to the target
include but are not limited to: refractive index structure function
parameter, Rytov number, atmospheric coherence width, iso-planatic patch
 size, turbulence assessment at various locations along the path,
aero-optic characterizations, and pertinent weather variables
(temperature, humidity and their gradients, pressure, wind, etc.).
Systems capable of measuring these atmospheric parameters from both
ground and airborne locations and at ranges of many tens of kilometers
are desired.      Information gained by the development of atmospheric
turbulence devices will be used to develop highly detailed physics-based
 models of the atmosphere, its effects on active imaging, and ways to
mitigate the effects both in hardware and software. Knowing the
underlying causes of image degradation due to atmosphere activity could
then be used to extrapolate and predict performance in other types of
atmospheres (for example, Mid-Atlantic, desert, arctic, etc.)      This
topic seeks to develop atmospheric characterization techniques to
determine the amount of phase errors introduced and their spatial and
temporal correlations. Techniques for mitigation of the atmospheric
phase may require knowledge of the atmosphere for benchmarking of
mitigation techniques and sensor characterization.      PHASE I:  Plan,
analyze, and design systems capable of characterizing and assessing
atmospheric optical turbulence and its effect on the performance of
coherent ladar systems in air-to-air, air-to-ground, and
ground-to-ground scenarios.      PHASE II:  Develop prototype system

properly characterize atmospheric turbulence in air-to-air,
air-to-ground, and ground-to-ground scenarios. Minimizing the technology
 as small as possible is desired. Airborne demonstrations are preferred

non-military applications: NASA space observations and imaging, NOAA
earth imaging, and data for adaptive optics applications.      PHASE III

Synthetic Aperture Radar",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop innovative techniques and
algorithms for airborne passive synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging
using terrestrial commercial transmitters as sources-of-opportunity.
   DESCRIPTION:  As military and commercial transmitters continue to
multiply, the availability of dedicated spectrum for radar applications
continues to degrade. Furthermore, contested, or
anti-access\/area-denial (A2\/AD) environments limit the survivability
of platforms employing active radar systems. Combined with the potential
 for reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements, these
considerations motivate the use of passive radar for imaging of ground
targets. Interest in passive radar has increased dramatically in recent
years, although the majority of the work has focused on airborne moving
target indicator (AMTI) using ground-based receivers. Recent experiments
 [1], have looked at airborne receivers for MTI. In addition, SAR images
 have been formed from airborne platforms using radar satellites as
illuminators [2] and from stationary receivers using navigation
satellites as transmitters [3]. A few efforts have explored the use of
commercial terrestrial illuminators for imaging [4]. Finally, limited
algorithmic development has explored imaging from airborne platforms
using commercial illuminators [5]. The state-of-the-art in passive
imaging allows high-resolution images to be formed using radar
illuminators, but only limited progress has been made in forming
high-resolution images using commercial sources of opportunity,
particularly when considering an airborne receiver. AFRL has recently
funded work in combining signals from multiple commercial illuminators
to improve AMTI and GMTI performance. This effort seeks to extend this
work for imaging applications.     In particular, this effort addresses
the potential to enhance platform survivability in A2\/AD environments
by forming high-resolution images of ground targets suitable for
Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) using passive radar. The focus is on
imaging using non-pulsed, terrestrial, commercial sources of opportunity
 using an airborne receiver. These sources are typically narrowband and
illuminate the terrain at low grazing angles and with relatively wide
beams. Thus, signals from multiple transmitters across multiple
frequency bands will need to be combined to obtain the bandwidth and
spatial diversity required for forming images of sufficient resolution
for military applications. Techniques leveraging such multistatic
configurations should account for expected target fluctuations across
this spatial aperture. Novel imaging schemes to exploit sparse
representations and to leverage other forms of prior knowledge may also
prove beneficial if justified by a proposed concept of operations.
Schemes which leverage multiple receive channels on a single platform or
 multiple coordinated receive platforms could also be considered to
improve system performance. The proposed approaches should identify and
improve standard image metrics, with a particular emphasis on obtaining
high-resolution images using commercial illuminators. This capability
would represent a substantial improvement over current state-of-the-art
performance enabling passive radar for tasks previously limited to
active radar systems.      A limited data set may be provided by the
government as part of Phase II. No government materials, equipment,
data, or facilities will be provided under Phase I.       PHASE I:
Define performance metrics for high-resolution airborne passive SAR
imaging. Conduct a trade study to select a set of illuminators to
exploit for the effort. Develop innovative image formation algorithms
and techniques tailored to the selected illumination sources. Validate
the proposed imaging scheme through simulation.      PHASE II:  Mature
the techniques developed in Phase I to support operation across multiple
 bands and multiple transmitters. Address practical implementation
concerns including autofocus, direct path cancellation, and other
potential challenges identified during Phase I. Demonstrate and validate
 the developed techniques on either measured or high-fidelity simulated
data.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Transition opportunities for
 this effort include ongoing passive radar efforts at AFRL and other

Passive Illumination",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop electro-optic (EO) infrared
(IR) sensors using aperture synthesis for partially coherent and passive
 illumination, providing increased resolution with reduced sensor volume
 and speckle noise.       DESCRIPTION:  In order to perform tactical
identification (ID) and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance
(ISR) missions at longer standoff ranges, better sensor resolution is
required. Currently, resolution of EO\/IR sensors is limited by sensor
clear aperture due to the associated volume, as well as the coherence
diameter for the path through the atmosphere. Techniques which enable
larger effective apertures with reduced sensor size weight and power
(SWaP) and the ability to mitigate atmospheric turbulence are required
to increase sensor resolution.  Aperture synthesis enables a larger
monolithic aperture to be replaced with a number of smaller
sub-apertures, with a reduction in volume approaching the ratio of the
sub-aperture diameter to the system aperture diameter. Synthesis
techniques are also compatible with compensation for atmospheric
turbulence, whether through digital phasing of sub-apertures, or through
 hardware means such as adaptive optics.     The current state of the
art for passive aperture synthesis in systems with large fields of view
utilize techniques based on Fizeau interferometry, where images from
multiple telescopes are coherently combined. This requires hardware to
correct for any piston and tilt phase errors to a fraction of a
wavelength, which becomes problematic for turbulent atmospheres and
large fields of view. Anisoplanatism due to the atmosphere requires
different phase corrections between apertures for different patches of
the field of view. The complexity of correcting for each isoplanatic
patch using hardware is untenable, making a computational solution
highly desirable. Coherent systems can readily perform such corrections
digitally, but suffer from speckle noise effects and short coherence
times due to target instability at optical wavelengths. Systems using
active illumination can further increase the size of a synthesized
aperture through the use of multiple transmitters, for both coherent and
 partially coherent illumination.     An innovative solution is desired
that enables digital aperture synthesis techniques to be used with
either short-wave infrared (SWIR) or mid-wave infrared (MWIR)
illumination that has a large fractional bandwidth, enabling sensors to
use a greater portion of the reflected light from an area of interest.
Techniques which employ multiple sub-apertures in order to reduce sensor
 size in addition to multiple transmitter locations to increase the
effective system aperture are preferred. Systems which are compatible
with both active and passive illumination are also desired, where active
 illumination may provide higher resolution while passive illumination
may be used to view a larger area of interest. Techniques should be
efficient in terms of required signal, with illumination and exposure
requirements approaching those of an ideal aperture equal in size to the
 system's synthesized aperture.  Applications of interest are performing
 ID and ISR missions from a flight environment with the system
integrated into a pod or EO turret. Sensor should be capable of
operating in atmospheric profiles consistent with up to 3 times
Hufnagel-Valley 5\/7, standoff ranges greater than 40 km for active
illumination, and standoff ranges greater than 100 km for passive
illumination.      PHASE I:  Investigate innovative approaches and model
 performance for potential airborne applications. All key aspects to the
 imaging functionality should be modeled to determine signal to noise
ratio (SNR), turbulence, exposure time, and detector noise that enable
successful aperture synthesis. Foundational experiments to verify
theoretical concepts should also be conducted.      PHASE II:  Mature
design and develop brassboard demonstrations for aperture synthesis
techniques. Design shall include requirements for all key subsystems,
such as sensor array, laser transmitter, and receiver optics. Brassboard
 demonstrations should verify functionality in turbulent atmospheres and

micron wavelength, such as Tm-doped high-power fiber laser systems.
Also, there is a need in developing MWIR high-power laser systems for
electronic warfare (EW) applications, such as infrared countermeasures
(IRCM), in which the laser sources may be spectrally or coherently
combined in order to achieve the required performance.
High-performance laser systems must be protected from unwanted back
reflected light, which may destabilize the laser or even damage the
internal laser cavity. An optical isolator is a device that is used for
this purpose since it transmits light in a particular direction while
blocking the light in the opposite direction. Commercially available
optical isolators are limited to the visible and near-IR spectra and are
 based on the magneto-optic effect (Faraday effect). These devices may
be polarization sensitive, typically for free space laser coupling, or
polarization insensitive, which are used in fiber optics applications.
Materials that exhibit very strong magneto-optic properties include
Indium Antimonide (InSb) and Mercury Telluride (HgTe), both of which may
 be used in MWIR and LWIR.  However, present materials systems and
geometrical structures may need to be improved to avoid the need for
cryogenic cooling and to deal with thermal lensing effects at high
powers. For standard Faraday rotation approaches, polarizing elements in
 the IR range may need to be developed for isolation purposes. Other
approaches that may be used to create an unidirectional propagation of
the light are based on nonlinear optical processes, in which a
nonreciprocal response can be realized. On-chip optical isolation based
on the magneto-optic nonreciprocal phase-shift effect has also been
explored in the near-IR spectrum and may be extended to the MWIR for
optical waveguide on-chip applications. Therefore, there is an
opportunity to develop new materials and techniques for optical
isolation in the 2-15 micron wavelength range, for which commercial
products do not exist.     In more sophisticated configurations, the
optical isolation may become an integral part of the laser system (or
integrated on a single chip), which provides unique properties such as
superior wavelength stability, ultrafast optical modulation, and
all-optical processing. An example of such systems may be injection
locked quantum cascade lasers operating in the MWIR spectrum. These
applications will open new horizons for all-optical computing, high data
 rate free space optical communications, IR spectroscopy, etc. Thus,
there is a need for new materials and techniques for optical isolation
in the 2-15 micron wavelength range.     Cooling is essential in
high-power IR optical isolators. At those wavelengths, about 20% of the
optical input power is lost inside the Faraday rotator and then released
 as the heat. Also small size, weight and power (SWaP) must be
considered for airborne systems applications.     There will be no
Government-furnished equipment for this project.      PHASE I:  Develop
materials and techniques suitable for constructing an optical isolator
based on the magneto-optic effects, time-dependent modulation, and\/or
nonlinear processes. Strongly asymmetric transmission should be achieved
 in the 2-15 micron spectrum for free space and\/or wave-guide setting,
including on-chip solutions. A free-space design should account for
thermal management at high powers.      PHASE II:  Using the results
from Phase I, fabricate and demonstrate a device capable of transmitting
 the light in one direction while blocking the light in the opposite
direction with return loss of up to 30-40 dB at power levels of up to
500W. The device may be free space, fiber coupled, polarization
sensitive or polarization independent.  Identify and propose a design,
which will allow for broadband operation of the optical isolator.
PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Based on the results of Phases I and
Phase II, develop and demonstrate an on-chip fiber-coupled broadband
optical isolator in the 2-15 micron spectrum with return loss of 40 dB
or better and insertion losses of less than 5 dB.",

standard is a 23 hour bake; much shorter bake times are desired.
DESCRIPTION:  Relief baking and plating operations are currently
required by LHE (low hydrogen embritteling) MIL-STD-870 (cadmium plate),
 USAF drawing 201027456 (Zn-Ni plating) and MIL-STD-1501 (Chromium
plate). Recent HE testing has shown that hydrogen can effectively be
relieved with much lower final bake times. Lower bake times represent a
significant savings to the USAF and industry in terms of processing
hours and cost.       To demonstrate safety of flight with reduced bake
time, the following required qualification tests will be accomplished on
 260-280 Ksi UTS 4340 HSS test coupons:     Hydrogen Embrittlement (ASTM
 F519-05)     Stress Corrosion Cracking (ASTM E 1681 or approved

sustained tensile stress test. HE coupon testing will utilize test
samples of 4340 high strength steel (260-280ksi). Currently the only
facility applying LHE ZnNi plating per USAF drawing 201027456 is located
 at Hill AFB.  All parameters and results will be recorded and reported.
 All test procedures and test criteria shall be coordinated and approved
 by the USAF requirements office and be accomplished according to
approved industrial standards with deviations approved by the TPOC. This
 project has applicability to all commercial \/industry plating
operations utilizing LHE varieties of cadmium and ZnNi plating. All test
 plans and data results will be subject to customer review and expert
panel review (ASTM F.07 HE committee), at the discretion of the TPOC.
   The following required qualification tests will be accomplished High
Strength Steel (HSS) including Aermet 100, 4340, S53 and possibly 300M

test plan will be finalized. If the result of the qualification tests
support the reduction of plating post bake times, LHE Zn-Ni plating
specification USAF DWG. 201027456, Chrome specification MIL-STD-1501,
and Cad specification Mil-STD-870 will be updated to reflect the reduced
 post plating bake time.      PHASE I:  Each F 519 sample group will be
cad plated, and tested as described above with varying bake times
utilized. Sample groups shall consist of 4-8 specimens. At a minimum;
sample group bake times will vary 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 23 hours. The
process will be repeated for LHE ZnNi plated specimens.  All samples
shall be pulled to failure after the HE testing is complete.       PHASE
 II:  Testing outlined in phase one will be repeated based on a rigorous
 design of experiments approach. Additional testing will be accomplished
 chromium plate added to additional groups of ZnNi and Cad plated
coupons.  Testing will also include comparative stress corrosion
cracking resistance (per ASTM E 1681 or approved equivalent) and general
 corrosion. Anomalies noticed in phase I will also be
re-evaluated\/defined and possibly re-tested; thicker material sections
will also be considered.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Will be

improved energy source that can be used as the primary power source for
Eddy Current (EC) and Ultrasonic (UT) nondestructive testing inspection
(NDI) equipment currently in use throughout the Air Force.
DESCRIPTION:  Nondestructive testing equipment in the AF is normally
used in flight lines and hangars where current use of batteries are
required but are costly and require daily recharging. EC and UT
equipment currently in use in the AF has the options of using
Lithium-ion, NiMH, NiCAD, or Alkaline battery in any of this equipment.
Transport and disposal of spare batteries is a shipping and
environmental cost to the AF. With the advances in technology in the
utilization of alternate power sources such as solar energy and fuel
cell designs, there is a good possibility that other forms of energy
power can also be used as the primary power source for AF NDI equipment.
 The goal is to reduce costs of electrical consumption, eliminate use of
 harmful toxins that destroy our environment, increase portability and
usability of equipment, increase utilization of instruments at deployed
locations, and increase safety of personnel. Considering the numbers of
this equipment in the AF, cost savings and reduction of hazardous
materials can be significant.      Research feasibility and
applicability of improved alternate energy source to current battery
configurations as source of power supply for EC and UT NDI equipment
currently in use in the AF. Design a new alternate source that could be
used interchangeably between EC and UT NDI equipment. Research
capability of alternate source design that will have high capacity and
operating time as long as if not longer than the most efficient storage
battery currently in use. Validate and verify performance of new
alternate source when used for EC and UT NDI equipment.      PHASE I:
Research the operating parameters for the various NDI hand tools noted
above and develop concept design for utilizing new energy capability to
replace existing required battery sources in the hand tools. Phase I
report should describe details of the design; necessary test plans and
performance parameters, demonstrate power requirements and how proposed
solar power design can be accomplished.      PHASE II:  Based on
approved design approach from Phase I, develop working prototypes for
the selected models and perform validation testing IAW Test Plan from
Phase I with users in AFSC and field groups.      PHASE III DUAL USE

 Barrel Fatigue Crack",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Development of a non-destructive
inspection (NDI) for medium caliber gun barrels to assess the presence
and severity of fatigue cracks in the barrel walls.        DESCRIPTION:
 Barrels have a variety of failure modes that must be monitored over the
 life of a barrel. Each barrel type typically has a driving failure mode
 that dictates the replacement schedule that must be adhered to when
fielded. Fatigue cracking is one of the more critical failure modes that
 must be prevented as it will result in a catastrophic barrel rupture.
This is typically prevented by assigning a maximum rounds count to the
barrel set. This mandatory replacement point is the worst case crack
growth rate with an appropriate safety factor applied. However, most
barrel sets do not see these worst case conditions therefore more life
could be gleaned from most barrels sets if a means of accurately
determining fatigue crack length could be developed.          An NDI
method is being sought after that will accurately and reliably assess
fatigue cracking in gun barrels and compare it against a maximum
allowable crack length. The new method would require the barrel wall to
be assessed throughout its thickness and over its entire length. The
machine must automatically compare any cracks found to the given limits
with little to no manual intervention. The machine will preferably be
portable, such that it can be used on flight lines without removing
barrels from the aircraft. In addition, it is also preferred that is
technology be incorporated into existing laser bore mapping equipment,
such that all barrel inspections can be accomplished through one
machine.       Currently, a method in which existing NDI equipment can
be used to assess barrel wall fatigue cracking is unknown. This project
will most likely require new equipment to be developed to accomplish the
 crack assessment along with new procedures for the use of the new
equipment. This project may potentially require the coordination of the
contractor with USAF testing facilities and the loaning of USAF barrels
for inspection testing. The technical point of contact will coordinate
the required access to USAF testing facilities.      PHASE I:  Develop
the ability to accurately and reliably detect fatigue cracks in medium
caliber gun barrels. Define the resolution, defect detection and
localization with sub-mm accuracy.      PHASE II:  Demonstrate the
non-destructive evaluation of cracking in barrels and comparison against
 crack limits with complete autonomy other than manpower necessary to
interface the machine with the barrel.       PHASE III DUAL USE

tools and resources to analyze and\/or evaluate usage and event data are
 not generally available across the USAF enterprise. The reasons for
this lack of availability are complex and varied. These reasons include
inadequate component reliability\/health metrics, legacy data
architectures lacking sufficient indenture, and a lack of understanding
that appropriate statistical analysis is a reliability improvement tool.
      Historically, Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), not Mean
Cumulative Function (MCF), has been the component reliability\/health
metric used by the Air Force. Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), is too
lagging to be actionable in the best case, and is not representative of
actual system reliability in the worst case. Although the necessary
usage and event data is being collected, these data are not readily
accessible.  When mature, this project will provide reliability analysts
 access to current Air Force data systems, a full suite of data and
statistical analysis tools and the understanding to access and utilize
usage and event data in new and powerful ways. Weapon system engineers
and supply chain professionals will have fully integrated access to the

outline during the Phase I R &amp; D effort such that compliance with 10
 U.S.C 2222(j)(2) can be accomplished at the point of commercialization

(NDAA) approval. The SBIR PH I NDAA Outline shall be further developed
during the Third Quarter of the Year 1 PH II SBIR project such that all
documentation required for NDAA can be completed. All documentation for
compliance with NDAA 10 U.S.C. 2222(j)(2) shall be accomplished by the
Seventh Quarter of the Year 2 PH II SBIR project. The NDAA documentation

current software\/data management capabilities as a baseline to define
the requirements of a new or improved data analysis and data management

Holes",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To develop a method to verify the
coverage and intensity of cold working processes on materials of
interest to the Air Force.       DESCRIPTION:  The Air Force and
industry partners perform many manufacturing processes with the aim of
inducing residual stress in metals to prevent the onset of fatigue
induced cracking. Cold working of metal alloys to create localized
compressive residual stresses can greatly improve fatigue behavior,
particularly in areas of stress concentration. Further, the application
of compressive residual stress on the leading edge of compressor or fan
blades can reduce an engine's susceptibility to foreign object damage
(FOD). In fatigue loading, compressive residual stresses effectively
lower the mean net stress state. Therefore, locations such as fastener
holes can greatly benefit from compressive residual stresses, as they
tend to mitigate the effects of the geometric stress concentration at
that location. In a FOD situation, this can prevent a crack from growing
 from a damage site.       Despite the known benefits of cold working
techniques, there are limitations in the ability to non-destructively
inspect its characteristics and analyze the associated component
longevity benefits in fatigue applications.  Many of the quality
assessment techniques used with cold working rely on witness samples and
 process controls. Assessment is not made on the component, which
requires the assumption that the processing of the component and sample
are the same. The conservatively necessary in assuming the similarity
between process samples and the component itself requires that full
credit cannot be given in design calculations to the benefits of the
treatment process. Current non-destructive techniques have significant
limitations. For example, x-ray diffraction is only able to measure the
stress state at the surface of the material, ignoring sub-surface
material, and cannot be used in some materials of interest to the Air
Force. Further, several of these cold working techniques only alter the
appearance of a treated area subtly. Even verifying a treatment was
applied can be difficult.      Consequently, a methodology is being
sought to quantify the effectiveness of cold working processes on the
components themselves. A method that can non-destructively verify the
intensity and coverage of a treatment will provide valuable information
to the Air force and associate industry partners. This information
represents valuable input to structural integrity analyses, to
accurately take into account the improved fatigue life properties that
are attributed to the cold working process. The resulting benefits of
the developed methodology are widespread, and include improving the
frequency of expensive inspection intervals by improving predictive
lifetime techniques.      PHASE I:  Develop the basis of an assessment
technique that can evaluate coverage and intensity of cold working
treatments on materials of interest to the Air Force and how it could be
 verified through coupon level testing during Phase II of the
development.       PHASE II:  : Develop a prototype cold work evaluation
 apparatus and develop related software algorithms that will implement
the framework from phase I. Demonstrate a procedure for using the
prototype to acquire data and show how that data can be used to improve
predictive maintenance programs.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:
Deployment to other critical applications would be available in private
industry, which arise in the civil aviation, automotive, railroad, heavy

overhaul and repair process for aircraft gas turbine engines, Landing
Gear and other critical parts, the repair depots routinely apply large
amounts of thermal spray coatings for use in substrate repair build-up,
wear, corrosion resistance, thermal barrier and chrome replacement
coatings. These coatings are applied at a high cost to the Department of
 Defense in terms of materials and manpower. In addition to the high
cost of coating materials, application of the coatings requires
expensive consumable materials including fuels, power and thermal spray
equipment components. Other major costs include masking,
calibration\/maintenance of the spray equipment, laboratory
metallurgical testing, reworking of parts that do not meet
metallographic requirements, engineering time supporting unacceptable
coatings, determining cause and rework. Quite often the needs of the
warfighter are jeopardized by inability to supply engine or landing gear
 components due to failure to determine quality of spray during
application of coatings. Additionally, AF programs such as High Velocity
 Maintenance (HVM) requirements and current\/future budgetary
constraints are forcing improvements in efficiencies and reduction in
waste for the coating processes in the application shops. For example,
rework of an engine component normally costs several thousand dollars
each time it is recycled. The specifications that are currently used to
procure coating feedstock allow acquisition of non-usable materials that
 fail to meet rigid metallurgical laboratory requirements and result in
unacceptably applied coatings. Also, the current set of process
parameters do not perform acceptably when used with all materials from
all vendors when purchased with the current material specification. To

(10-3000 psi). Since adhesion may be an issue for ID application, with
dust and debris contamination in the spray environment, spallation must
be tested. In addition, grinding in component bores is quite difficult
especially with high hardness coatings. Grinding and or machining
processes to achieve the requisite finish requirements for sealing is
needed. Corrosion testing will also be required.       Additionally,
using HVOF technology is not a hard and fast requirement. Other thermal
spray technologies, such as Plasma, which is currently being used in
industry and has the potential to be modified (if required or needed)
for ID Landing Gear applications is acceptable and will be evaluated
with the same scrutiny as HVOF applied coatings. The ability to apply
other than EHC coatings to non-line of sight Landing Gear applications
will greatly increase the Air Force"s, other Department of Defense (DoD)
 and commercial entities ability to comply to the mandate of reducing
Hexavalent Chrome Emissions as well as the new Occupational Safety and

corrosion testing. Perform seal compatibility testing and spallation.

fuel-cell technology that will allow generation of electricity from
access to bacteria such that it can offset wastewater treatment plant
operational costs associated with Military facility\/utility operations.
       DESCRIPTION:  Fuel Cells are promising new energy technology that
 focuses on new and innovative approaches in which
electrochemical\/chemical reactions release electricity (electrons) and
heat, and a byproduct which is only water. In waste water system,
bacteria growth naturally generates electrons as they breakdown organic
materials. A microbial fuel cell uses a chemical reaction inside
bacteria as the source of its electrons. Since a fuel cell concept
already exists that powers the electric grid, a bacteria powering the
fuel cell will in turn power the electric grid.  Research efforts are
required to maximize this concept to make fuel cell energy output more
efficient. By accomplishing this task, wastewater treatment processes
optimized for fuel cell technology advancements will prove to be a
renewable energy technology that will be chartered for military as well
as applications.      PHASE I:  Demonstrate the feasibility of a
prototype fuel cell technology focused on wastewater treatment products
and processes that employ bacteria as a source of electron produced
naturally as they breakdown organic materials captured in the
composition of the wastewater. The system should support real-time
characteristics of wastewater and\/or industrial wastewater systems
suitable for military sites.      PHASE II:  Provide a prototype system
that demonstrates fuel cell capabilities to generate wattage based on
microbial fuel cell theoretical principles, emphasizing chemical
reactions that releases electricity and heat energy and produces only
water as a by-product. The system design should be expandable to
eventually generate enough power to supply the waste water facility
itself and eventually feed into the grid itself.      PHASE III DUAL USE

acquiring electricity generation that will be applied to the electric
grid, thereby realistically recovering enough energy to operate a

Hydrogen Embrittlement (LHE) Chromium Plate",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop Low Hydrogen Embrittlement
(LHE) chromium plate stripping method for landing gear eliminating the
liberation of hexavalent chrome in the stripping process.
DESCRIPTION:  While the current state-of-the-art is changing for landing
 gear applications, the use of hexavalent chromium (Cr+6) as a wear
and\/or corrosion preventative surface is still widespread. Current
stripping processes for low Hydrogen embrittlement (LHE) Chromium plate
can liberate levels of Cr+6 in excess of established OSHA PELs. High
Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) coatings are being introduced, but removal
of legacy chrome plated components will be occurring for some time.
  Stripping methods that prevent liberation of Cr+6 are desired.
Mechanical strip processes could alternately be considered but must
consider substrate safety\/compatibility (e.g. grinding burns, substrate
 pitting and degradation). Aqueous stripping processes must consider
safety\/material compatibility in terms of Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE)
on High Strength Steel (HSS) substrates such as 300M and 4340M. All
stripping processes must consider material compatibility (fatigue,
material removal) and may also require reductive immobilization of Cr+6
from waste products. Replacement processes should be economically viable
 and preferentially abiotic, with the objective of causing no impacts to
 labor and processing time in the maintenance cycle.      Substantial
research into environmental Cr+6 clean-up and immobilization efforts has
 been performed, with primary application to soils chemistry. These
methods primarily focus on conversion of Cr+6 to Cr+3 through reduction
of Cr+6 contaminants by electron-donating compounds and bio-stimulaters.
       Bio-stimulaters (e.g. Hydrogen-Release Compound [HRC]) are
polylactates that encourage microbial fermentation and a rich, steady
supply of Hydrogen as electron donors in the natural conversion of Cr+6
to Cr+3. Abiotic compounds (e.g. Metals Remediation Compound [MRC], Iron
 Humate, Oxihumolite, Sodium Bisulfite, Iron Oxides, etc.) react
directly with Cr+6 in the waste stream, creating a reductive environment
 for chemical conversion of Cr+6 to Cr+3, which then either precipitates
 out of solution as solid trivalent chromium hydroxide or binds strongly
 to iron-oxides in the sorbents or humic acid matrices. Strong binding
between Cr+3 and sorbents reduces the likelihood of subsequent
liberation into the environment. Abiotic compounds tend to encourage
faster reduction and immobilization of Cr+6 and can frequently work
at"natural"pH levels (~ 3.9  7 pH).       Other methods of reduction of
Cr+6 involve eco-friendly stripping methods utilizing acid peroxide
solutions to chemically strip Cr+6 from the substrate, then filtering
the chromium metal"sheets,"from solution and using electrolytic methods
to recover Cu2+ and Ni2+ for reuse. The chromium"sheets"can then be
reused, disposed of, or converted to Cr+3 per methods described above.
One example of this process can be found in Patent EP1591545B1.  The
feasibility of these example processes are unknown for landing gear
overhaul applications.      PHASE I:  Conduct process and material
feasibility\/safety testing for landing gear applications in the
Description of eco-friendly Cr+6 chemical, mechanical, and aqueous
stripping, reduction, and immobilization methods\/compounds. Downselect
to one or two candidates. Provide business case analyses, data, reports,
 to support feasibility\/safety\/economic\/materials compatibility with
landing gear HSS to USAF.       PHASE II:  Conduct extended
compatibility testing of Phase I downselected candidates, demonstrating
compatibility with HSS for fatigue, strength, HE, and corrosion and
safe, economic Cr+3 disposal; scale for production; perform prototype
processing on various landing gear components with complex geometries
within USAF facilities constraints; perform manufacturing readiness

feasibility\/compatibility. Downselect to a single method as
appropriate.     PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Implement full scale

Manufacturing (AM) Processes",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Investigate, determine, and
recommend a method to evaluate legacy components which are candidates
for Additive Manufacturing (AM) process(es).       DESCRIPTION:  With
the USAF facing challenges of aging systems, reduced budgets, and
increasingly complex supply chains and diminishing industrial base, the
need to develop cost-reduction and alternative manufacturing process
driven programs now more important than ever. The diminishing industrial
 base creates a list of hard-to-source components\/parts across
maintenance organizations that continue to grow, adding workload
pressures and backlog within the local alternate sourcing program
offices. Besides identifying alternate sources for the same or similar
part, the sourcing office is often tasked with identifying alternate
manufacturing processes and materials to reduce cost, improve product
efficiency through government-contractor developed initiatives. Here in
lies the opportunity to leverage the emerging manufacturing process,
namely Additive Manufacturing (AM), and combined with part redesign has a
 positive repercussion on cost saving. One current challenge lies in
understanding what legacy components are even viable candidates given
the capabilities of the AM technologies and the emerging industrial
base. To fully exploit the inherent benefits of additive manufacturing,
the responsible configuration design engineer must first identify
candidate components\/assemblies and then re-engineer the necessary
configuration and manufacturing processes required in using AM processes
 and material configurations. AM does not have the geometric constraints
 of traditional manufacturing processes, and this absence of geometric
constraints allows focusing redesign efforts on part functionality and
assembly. Assembling processes and costs can be reduced by rationalizing
 part count and fabricating devices in their assembled state. The
challenge lies in an understanding amongst the sustainment engineers in
how to think beyond conventional processes boundaries\/constraints and
exploit the capabilities of the available AM technologies, equipment,
and materials. Conventional redesign parameter examples are component
geometry characteristics, dimensional tolerances, shape volume, surface
finish, material requirements, loading and cycle conditions, and cost.
    The goal of this research effort is to help establish the viability
of an AM benchmark and guidelines for sustainment engineers to apply in
identification of candidate parts when considering whether AM is a
viable and economical alternative to conventional manufacturing methods
for legacy components. The methodology would advise on the most
promising and efficient AM process, based on Form, Fit, and Function.
How performance testing could be waived due to current AM powder
material processing already meeting current acceptable specifications
should be a very critical parameter.      PHASE I:  Research a
methodology approach to provide AM benchmark and guidelines on subset of
 AM technologies\/capabilities addressing the above goal. Provide
concept demonstration with several AFSC example parts thru the
methodology. Examples should show both good and poor candidates for AM
success.  Concept should include parts requiring different AM processes
and materials.      PHASE II:  With the success of demonstrated concept
in Phase I, continue with expanding the provided methodology with
additional AM technologies and processes. Additional AFSC part examples
will be demonstrated and validated thru the process. Guidelines should
also provide what testing may be necessary or could be waived to satisfy
 re-engineering requirements.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: With
 the success of Phase II validations the transition to high confidence
rating for engineering implementation would be performed and have
potential for AM and OEM partnerships within AFSC Complexes.",

        "topic_name": "Beyond Fault Diagnosis and Failure Prognosis
Fault Tolerant Control of Aerospace Systems",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Development of a rigorous health
management approach to critical aircraft systems that combines
effectively in real-time concepts from Prognostics and Health Management
 (PHM) and fault-tolerant or reconfigurable control areas.
DESCRIPTION:  The Air Force and DoD in general are actively seeking and
pursuing the development and utility of new technologies to improve the
safety and reliability of critical military assets. Aircraft and other
complex systems are subjected to fault\/failure modes that may
compromise the successful completion of military missions or result in
loss of life and\/or asset. Past R &amp; D efforts for aircraft safety,
reliability and sustainability have focused on the development of
on-board sensing strategies, fault diagnosis and failure prognosis
algorithms aimed to warn the operator or maintainer of incipient
failures. This research has produced significant outcomes with health
and usage monitoring systems installed on multiple aircraft\/rotorcraft
reporting on the health status of their critical components\/systems.
    New and innovative technologies are needed that build upon and
complement PHM methods while providing an added value to the warfighter
in terms of improved vehicle autonomy. Consider, for example, a typical
mission scenario where an aircraft is flying over enemy territory and is
 subjected to severe fault conditions. Can the vehicle return safely to
the base without experiencing a catastrophic failure? Is it possible
that failure prognostic information may assist the reconfiguration of
the vehicle"s available control authority so that its remaining useful
life could be extended by trading off performance for useful life and
allowing the aircraft to land at a safe destination? This topic
addresses these important concerns and seeks the development of fault
tolerant control methodologies that will take advantage of prognostic
information and safeguard the integrity of the asset. The ultimate goal
is the design and operation of high-confidence systems that deliver
capability as designed. To achieve this goal, the emphasis needs to
expand beyond the notion of reliability and prognostics and focus on
system integrity management.      Integrity management is viewed in this
 topic as maintenance of the operational response of high-valued assets
in the presence of adverse internal (faults\/failures) events.
System\/component failures and malfunctions are recognized as
contributing factors to aircraft loss-of-control in flight. Despite the
growing demand for improved reliability, safety and availability of
dynamic systems, little work has been published discussing the specific
role of prognosis in trolled systems. It is anticipated that the
contractor will exploit available or new prognostic routines, i.e.
real-time estimates of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of failing
components in order to reconfigure the available control authority by
trading off system performance with control activity. The enabling
technologies may take advantage of optimization methods in combination
with control algorithms such as Model Predictive Control.      PHASE I:
 The contractor will conceptualize a framework that exploits on-line
prognostic information to trade-off system performance for RUL in a
control reconfiguration or fault-tolerant control scheme. The emphasis
is on the control aspects that will enable such a trade off to be
accomplished resulting in longer vehicle life and completing
successfully a designated mission.      PHASE II:  Develop fully and
validate the modules of the fault-tolerant control architecture with
actual aircraft data or available aircraft components in a laboratory
environment; the required data for system validation purposes will be
provided by the project technical point of contact. The contractor is
expected to produce a"product"consisting of software modules for failure
 prognosis and control reconfiguration that may be applicable to a
variety of military and industrial systems\/processes.        PHASE III
DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: It is anticipated that prognostics enhanced fault
 tolerant control will improve initially the autonomy, reliability and
survivability of military aircraft. Performance and effectiveness of the
 integrated modules must be demonstrated and compared to other
methods.",

        "topic_name": "Corrosion- Preventative, Super-hydrophobic
Coatings for Landing Gear",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Development of ultra water-repellent
 compounds for application to landing gear in corrosion-prone
environments, providing an additional level of corrosion protection for
components exposed to difficult service environments.
DESCRIPTION:  Landing gear components experience service in extreme
environments, and often utilize materials that are prone to corrosion.
As such, corrosion prevention is critical in ensuring the safety and
reliability of USAF landing gear. Currently, USAF landing gear corrosion
 prevention comprises one or more of the following, based on the
function of the surface: sacrificial platings (cadmium, LHE Zn-Ni),
barrier platings (chromium, HVOF, nickel, anodize, etc.), and
primer\/paint application. However, these defenses can be compromised or
 can be inadequate for the service conditions to which they are
subjected, and as a result USAF landing gear components continue to
experience corrosion. Accordingly, the USAF is interested in exploring
additional means of corrosion protection. Super-hydrophobic coatings
(SHC"s) are one such possibility, and are the intended subject of this
project.       Application of super-hydrophobic coatings on landing gear
 could potentially be accomplished in a number of ways, such as:
incorporation into paint, incorporation into existing plating processes,
 or direct application of the super-hydrophobic coating (either to base
metal prior to other coating\/finishing processes, or at some point
along the coating\/finishing process, or after all other
coating\/finishing process have been completed). Each application
process may have strengths and weaknesses associated with it, and it may
 be that more than one application process is needed. For example,
incorporating super-hydrophobic materials into paint would have the
advantage that no additional processing steps would be required  landing
 gear could be painted as normal, and as a result the majority of the
external surfaces would become super-hydrophobic. However, the
disadvantage of this approach is that not all surfaces that are at risk
of corrosion are painted - for example, threads on outer cylinders are
particularly prone to corrosion, and would not be protected by a paint
application. This would perhaps lead to the conclusion that a new
application process is needed, but the economics of adding a new process
 to the depot overhaul and new manufacturing requirements must be
considered. Accordingly, a complete solution for super-hydrophobic
coatings may need to consider multiple application processes, which
would then be selectively applied based on the economic and engineering
requirements of the parts to be coated.      Because of the critical
nature of landing gear and the sensitivity of many of the materials used
 in landing gear, compatibility of landing gear materials and any
super-hydrophobic material that would potentially be used in a landing
gear application must be ensured. So in addition to the corrosion
testing that will be required to demonstrate a super-hydrophobic
material provides the desired benefit, testing will also be required to
ensure the super-hydrophobic coating does not have any unintended
consequences. This type of testing includes hydrogen embrittlement
testing and fatigue debit testing. Additionally, testing will be needed
to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed coating, answering
questions such as: How quickly can the coating be applied? How uniformly
 or consistently can it be applied? How well does it stay on? How does
it affect other coatings or paints used on the same part? How can it be
removed? For threaded components, how is the torque-tension relationship
 affected? What are the environmental and health ramifications of the
coating, or the processes used to apply and remove it?       PHASE I:
Determine application methods for super-hydrophobic coating and conduct
preliminary BCA to determine costs for implementation; BCA should
include an ROI calculation that compares the anticipated savings to the
expected costs. Conduct feasibility testing of super-hydrophobic
compound candidates, to include corrosion testing and hydrogen
embrittlement testing. Down-select to one or two candidates.     PHASE
II:  Optimize application\/removal of SHC"s. Perform fatigue debit
testing on representative specimens. Expand corrosion testing to
additional materials and coating combinations. Conduct torque-tension
testing and corrosion testing to determine applicability to threaded
applications. Conduct wear and\/or FOD resistance testing to determine
survivability. Downselect to final super-hydrophobic coating. Prepare
specification to enable the procurement of parts coated with the SHC"s.
Refine BCA\/ROI.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Implement
successful candidates from Phase II. A successful product may be adopted
 by all DOD and industry.",

Fuels",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate hot surface
ignition test apparatus capable of controlling all thermal conditions
necessary for an accurate evaluation of aviation fluid ignition
properties.       DESCRIPTION:  Fire protection for military aircraft
has been the focus of continuing research for many years. With the
Montreal Agreement firmly in place (and the production ban of
halogenated fire suppressants), the ability to effectively suppress
aircraft fires is of great concern. As a result there is a renewed
interest and urgent need to understand fires caused by hot surface
ignition (HSI). Unfortunately, much of the published work on HSI was
conducted by the Air Force in the 1970s and 1980s on aviation fuels and
flammable fluids that were less susceptible to ignition. The general
approach of these early studies was to experimentally evaluate a large
number of conditions so as to find the most optimum conditions for hot
surface ignition of various aviation liquids. As a result, the test
conditions tended to be complex, involving irregular hot surface
geometries, fluid sprays, fuel drips or streams, varying airflow over
the target surface, and in some cases, upstream obstacles in the airflow
 generating stagnation or recirculation zones near the hot surface.
Large variations in the minimum HSI temperature (MHSIT) were reported
for the same flammable fluid. Operational assumptions that a hot surface
 fire would not occur often proved incorrect.     This lack of agreement
 in MHSIT results from misunderstanding the ignition process and the
flow phenomena involved. The current SBIR topic seeks to develop HSI
apparatus that is capable of providing a fundamental understanding of
hot surface ignition phenomena, and be able to simultaneously produce
reliable MHSIT data on aviation fuels. This standalone HSI apparatus
must be able to control all necessary fluid thermal conditions to
accurately evaluate the probability of ignition of aviation fuels on
flat horizontal, flat inclined, and curved surfaces. Thermal conditions
of the hot surface must be uniform within +\/-10 degrees Celsius with
regulation from 350 C to 700 C. Thermal conditions of the flammable
fluid must be uniform within +\/-5 degrees Celsius with regulation from 0
 to 100 degrees Celsius. Thermal conditions of the surrounding test
environment must be uniformly controlled and adjustable for airflow and
turbulence. Thermal conditions must be documented prior to injection of
flammable fluids onto the hot surface. The apparatus must be able to
control the fuel flow rate and the method of fuel introduction (i.e.,
drops, stream or spray). The final HSI apparatus must be validated using
 well documented fuels for comparison with published data. The apparatus
 must be suitable for evaluation of legacy fuels, alternative fuels, and
 hydraulic fluids used within aviation. All output data must be
available for development of vulnerability models for both legacy and
future aircraft systems.      PHASE I:  Design a reliable hot surface
ignition apparatus capable of accurately controlling all necessary fluid
 thermal conditions. As part of the design process a model will be also
be developed that can account for variations in temperature, pressure,
and airflow, to a sufficient level to enable a better understanding of
hot surface ignition, and the impact of surrounding turbulence on
ignition.      PHASE II:  Fabricate the HSI test apparatus and
experimentally document steady fluid thermal fields under different
turbulence conditions in the absence of flammable fluids and fire.
Compare to the model developed in Phase I and adjust the model
accordingly. Test and evaluate HSI properties of a baseline reference
fuel, JP-8, and an alternative aviation fuel under controlled
conditions. Publish MHSIT results openly for development of
vulnerability models for both legacy and future aircraft systems.
PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Commercialize the hot surface ignition
apparatus for evaluation of all legacy and future aircraft system
flammable fluids for improvements to operational risk assessments.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop measurement system, with
minimal interference (i.e., nano-tech films), for high-load regimes
capable of continuous measurement of normal and shear forces along the
wheel-tire interface with angular position of a quasi-static rolling
tire.       DESCRIPTION:  In military aircraft tires, the wheel-tire
interface (bead-seat) region is of particular interest since the
generated ground forces terminate into the
load-bearing"bead-seat"contact area. Thus, the forces generated in both
the tire and wheel interface region is of interest. The ability to
capture and characterize contact stress behavior at the wheel-tire
interface contract region, at a given angular position, may support
performance\/service life predictions and maybe applicable to enhancing
engineering analysis to include: contract load distributions, tire worn
limiting conditions, rim slip, wheel fracture indications or roll life,
etc.       Additionally, this new measurement system will improve
systems performance and reliability by facilitating design optimization
of landing gear components.  Current laboratory tire test technology,
employed by the 96th Test Group"s Landing Gear Test Facility (LGTF), can
 apply a vertical force up to 75,000 lbs with 30,000 lb side load and
brake torque of 240,000 in-lbs to include combined camber (10 degrees)
and yaw (20 degrees) for a slow rolling tire test (1 inch\/second).
Existing measurement methods of the contact pressure at the wheel-tire
interface are limited to only capturing the normal pressure at this
interface.  Therefore, a new measurement technology is required to
obtain both normal and shear forces at this interface contact region.
   The new measurement system should be designed to provide real-time,
continuous measurement of contact pressure variations of both the normal
 and shear forces at the wheel-tire interface of a quasi-static (i.e.,
slow rolling, ~ 1 inch\/second under load) rolling tire assembly. To
minimize error and improve the accuracy and fidelity of current
technology, the measurement system should introduce minimal test article
 interference (i.e., apply nano-scale thin films). This measurement
system must be capable of accurate and precise operation at greater than
 150% of the rated tire load and 3,500 psi at the bead-seat. The goal is
 to continually measure both the normal and shear forces along the
bead-seat. However, smaller measurement areas that enable reconstruction
 of the entire bead-seat contact stress behavior are permissible (i.e.,
at known angular locations or positions).          No
commercially-available system provides these capabilities. Tire bead
seat pressure measurement systems have been used in tire testing, but
provide discrete measurements and no information on shear. Films that
are sensitive to both normal and shear forces have been developed, but
have not been commercialized for tire testing.      The Air Force
envisions four levels of success in the program:    (1) Phase I
demonstration of a system that can provide the measurements described
above in the load\/size ranges required for aircraft tire testing.   (2)
 Phase II laboratory Tire Force Machine testing demonstration.  (3)
Phase III development of flight-line-based systems.  (4) Phase III
commercialization for airline, automotive\/truck, and heavy equipment
tire testing.      PHASE I:  Demonstrate feasibility of measurement
system with minimal test article interference to determine variations of
 contact pressures (normal and shear stresses) along the wheel-tire
interface of a quasi-static rolling tire assembly. Explore tradeoffs
relating to measurement area, spatial resolution, sensitivity, and
dynamic response.      PHASE II:  Apply test measurement method to
full-scale demonstration on tire force machine that is applicable to
aircraft tire loads and operating environment. Demonstrate sensor test
repeatability with less than 5% error and automated data acquisition
with data import to finite element models. Show capability to correlate
tire\/wheel load distributions to define worn limiting conditions and
ability to support wheel-tire life prediction. Consider as tool for
depot flight line evaluations.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a fast-running and accurate
analysis code that quantifies the fuel spurt due to hydrodynamic ram
within a fluid-filled fuel tank.       DESCRIPTION:  Hydrodynamic ram
(HRAM) refers to the overpressure produced by the impact and high speed
motion of a projectile within a fluid-filled fuel tank. The Air Force
has studied this phenomenon for over 35 years. During this time, several
 physics-based and semi-empirical analysis methods were developed and
studied. The current state of the art and most recent work has focused
on Arbitrary Lagrange Euler and coupled SPH-Lagrange finite element
techniques. While these methods have shown promise in modeling the HRAM
event, emphasis was on characterizing the overpressure and resulting
tank wall damage and not on quantifying fuel spurting out the entrance
hole. Furthermore, current versions of these methods require large
computer resources and result in long run times.     Tests show that the
 ability to accurately predict fire ignition in dry bays adjacent to
fuel tanks is dependent on accurate fuel spurt predictions. A modeling
capability is needed that accurately accounts for fuel spurt due to
hydrodynamic ram within a fast-running analysis code. The code must
advance the current state of the art to be able to predict fuel spurt
timing, volume, and droplet size resulting from a HRAM event where the
tank"s parameters (fluid temperature, pressure, volume, dimensions,
materials and thicknesses, curvatures, clutter, fluid depth), impactor
parameters (type, velocity, impact obliquity, and propensity for
tumbling), and impact location (relative to the fuel head and to tank
walls) are modeled variables. The code must able to match test data
within 10% of spurt timing, volume, and droplet size.      PHASE I:
Demonstrate the feasibility of accurately predicting fuel spurts due to
hydrodynamic ram within a generic fluid-filled fuel tank. Demonstrate
the ability to accurately represent fuel spurt volume and droplet size
as a function of time.      PHASE II:  Fully develop the simulation
tools demonstrated in Phase I and validate the models and tools on a
typical fuel tank having internal stiffening structure and clutter
components. Fully validate the ability to accurately represent fuel
spurt volume and droplet size as a function of time.      PHASE III DUAL
 USE APPLICATIONS: Commercialize the code for application all commercial
 and military air, ground, and sea vehicles that have fluid-filled fuel
tanks.",

        "topic_name": "Advanced Infrared Emitter Array (AIREA)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate an IR scene
projector (IRSP) based on advanced emitter technology that operates in
the mid-wave region with high spatial resolution and high radiant
intensity output.       DESCRIPTION:  Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) test
and evaluation of advanced precision guided munitions requires the
capability to stimulate sensors and seekers under test with synthetic IR
 imagery via real-time IR scene projection. An IRSP must be capable of
displaying realistic scenes at required refresh rates with sufficient
resolution, dynamic range, pixel response times, and accurate radiant
intensity output to properly stimulate the unit under test (UUT).
Historically, HITL testing has relied on IRSPs that utilize resistor
array emitter technology to project IR imagery to the UUT. However,
resistor array based IRSPs are constrained in radiant intensity output
and spatial resolution due to material composition and fabrication
limitations. These restrictions leave resistor arrays incapable of
projecting high resolution high temperature IR imagery needed to
adequately test next-generation sensors and seekers.  Advancements in IR
 seeker and sensor resolution, sensitivity, and field of view are
exceeding IR scene projection capabilities. Analogous advancements in
IRSP performance are needed for HITL testing of advanced IR sensors and
seekers. In particular, a suitable IRSP must provide the capability to
project at least 1k by 1k pixel imagery with maximum temperatures up to
3000K at 400Hz or greater. Also, IRSPs must operate in a non-flickering
mode.     Recent developments in alternative IR emitter technology may
satisfy requirements to test next generation IR sensors and seekers.  In
 particular, IR LED emitter technology has shown promise in emulating IR
 scenes that will meet future test requirements.  These emitters have
demonstrated the capability to present mid-wave IR imagery with high
temperature emission in a 512 by 512 pixel format using 48m pixel pitch
technology. Although the IR LED emitters have demonstrated the ability
to emulate high temperature IR scene elements, they have not yet
demonstrated the ability to support higher resolutions. Also, other
technologies exist such as vertical cavity surface emitting lasers that
may serve as an alternative IRSP for certain applications.      Novel
techniques are required to increase spatial resolution of advanced
emitter arrays. Investigation and analysis must be performed to identify
 approaches for fabricating high resolution emitter arrays and determine
 the feasibility of implementing these approaches. With an increased
resolution, it is desired that the proposed high temperature high
resolution emitter array designs maintain the well-established footprint
 of current generation IR arrays of 48m pixel pitch with formats of 512
by 512 pixels to ensure compatibility of existing optical components in
HITL test configurations.       PHASE I:  Identify approaches to
increase spatial resolution of advanced emitter arrays. Provide an
analysis of alternatives that evaluates the feasibility of each approach
 and identifies the best approach to pursue.  Provide a system
performance prediction for the chosen approach.      PHASE II:  Design,
deliver, and demonstrate a prototype emitter array (greater than 1k x
1k).      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: An advanced IRSP would
benefit closed-loop HITL and open-loop testing of advanced IR sensors
and seekers.  Military uses include test &amp; evaluation of PGMs and
aircraft protection systems.  Commercial uses include testing of
fire\/security systems, and thermal imagers used for inspection
activities.",

Loads Analysis",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Research and develop analysis
techniques and tools to develop a predictive combined static and dynamic
 external loads tool using non-proprietary physics-based models and
existing flight-test data in a real-time environment.       DESCRIPTION:
  Airframe external loads (both static and dynamic loads) are dependent
on a number of different parameters. For example, horizontal tail loads
(bending moment, torsion, shear) may be dependent on Mach number,
dynamic pressure, normal load factor (Nz), angle of attack, horizontal
tail position, trailing edge flap position, control surface rates, as
well as structural dynamics, surface shock waves, etc. In a real-time
flight-test monitoring environment, it is critical to be able to
accurately and quickly analyze measured external loads to determine what
 parameters are primarily driving the loads, why there are differences
between measured and predicted loads, what is causing the differences in
 predicted loads, and whether or not the next point in the test point
series should be attempted (given a set of expected input parameters).
The intent of this topic is to develop a real-time tool that can be used
 to analyze flight-test data and extrapolate external loads trends
within the subsonic, transonic, and supersonic flight regimes.     As a
result of contractual constraints, the aircraft structural and
aerodynamic models that are developed by the prime contractors are not
typically available to the Air Force. Therefore, the tool should be able
 to incorporate all available sources of information (to potentially
include reduced order aerodynamic and\/or structural models), but should
 only require sources of data that would be expected to be available to
the Air Force Test Center (AFTC) (analytically predicted component loads
 for a given set of conditions, allowable load envelopes, and flight
test measured data).     The tool should also be able to be integrated
into the AFTC real-time control room environment, and should be able to
utilize all previously acquired flight-test data to project expected
loads for test points yet to be flown given a set of input parameters.
     PHASE I:  Research in this phase should focus on development of
analysis methodology, analysis of alternatives, and predictive
techniques, concept of operation, and any analysis needed to demonstrate
 readiness for Phase II.       PHASE II:  Research in this phase should
include development of the tool and incorporation into real-time
flight-test environment at Edwards Air Force Base, CA.       PHASE III
DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This is an enabling technology that, if
successful, will provide improved predictive and flight-test analysis
capabilities leading to safer and more efficient loads envelope
expansion. If successfully developed, this tool should also have broader
 use within the commercial flight test community.",

        "topic_name": "Rule-Based XML Validation for T &amp;amp; E
(RuBX)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop methods for capturing
semantic rules of Test &amp; Evaluation metadata and automate validation
 of related XML instances.       DESCRIPTION:  The use of the eXtensible
 Markup Language (XML) to define instrumentation metadata for test setup
 in Test &amp; Evaluation (T &amp; E) is growing rapidly. In particular,
 the IRIG 106 Telemetry Standard [1] has recently incorporated a
translation of the Telemetry Attributes Standard (TMATS) into XML and
has added the XML-based Instrumentation Hardware Abstraction Language
(IHAL) [2]. Further, the intent is to incorporate the integrated Network
 Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) Metadata Description Language (MDL) into IRIG
 106 in the near future. It is likely that other existing XML-based
standards will be used in conjunction with these standards and that new
XML-based structures will be developed in the years or decades to come.
     The XML standard itself primarily defines syntax, although it also
captures some very simple conditions, such as data typing. However,
specific instances of XML used in testing must also follow a variety of
semantic rules in order to be valid. A simple example of this is that
the value of one parameter (say, primary gain) may affect the allowable
values of another parameter (say, secondary gain). As the complexity of a
 T &amp; E instrumentation system increases, the complexity of the rules
 and difficulty of validation increases as well.  In particular, the
iNET program will greatly enhance the ability to have multi-vendor
systems and a complete XML instance may be created by piecing together
segments of XML from different vendors. Estimates for a complete XML
instance of a large data system are on the order of a million lines of
XML. This requires a system-level validation that cannot be accomplished
 manually or by the individual vendors. For example, there may be timing
 constraints imposed by one vendor"s devices that can affect the timing
of other vendor"s devices. In the extreme case, there may be conflicts
between vendor"s setups that must be deconflicted.      The validation
process thus has several levels.  First, the rules themselves must be
captured, both at an individual device (or vendor) level and at a system
 level. Second, these rules must be applied against specific XML
instances. Third, any conflicts must be identified. If automated
approaches to deconfliction can be developed, then there is the
potential for some level of automated optimization of the overall setup
as well.    As described in [3], this is part of a larger vision to
provide automated instrumentation support that allows test engineers to
focus on requirements and analysis. The overall problem is a constraint
satisfaction problem [4] as described in [5]. The basic mechanisms of
automating rule-based validation are being developed in efforts such as
The Rule Markup Initiative [6][7] and approaches to optimization include
 Multi-Constraint Optimization techniques [8]. Part of this effort would
 be to evaluate what standards and efforts are useful or need to be
interfaced with.      PHASE I:  Research and develop structures that
define instrumentation setup rules for XML-based T &amp; E metadata.
Establish theoretical foundations for capturing these rules, for using
these rules to automate validation of XML, and to deconflict and
optimize multi-vendor instrumentation test system setups.       PHASE
II:  Refine and expand the rule structures and the mechanisms for
capturing the rules developed in Phase I. Work towards standardizing
these structures and the non-software based mechanisms (as a
non-proprietary standard). Develop software to automate the validation
process and, to the extent possible, the deconfliction and optimization
processes.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Applicable to systems
that use instrumentation to collect measurement data, i.e., systems
going through developmental T &amp; E, including commercial aircraft,
automobiles, heavy equipment, as well as areas such as structures
monitoring, general manufacturing, and equipment quality assurance
processes.",

        "topic_name": "Arc jet Test-Article Surface Recession Rate
Monitor",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and demonstrate a
three-dimensional Recession Rate Monitor system for real-time test
article surface contour mapping in arc jet facilities.
DESCRIPTION:  A three-dimensional (3-D) recession rate monitor system is
 needed for real-time test article surface contour mapping in the AEDC
arc jet facilities. Surface recession is a critical data parameter for
testing of heat shield materials since component design hinges largely
on material recession performance. The monitoring system must be
non-intrusive to the test article. Test article materials are subjected
to high-temperature, high-pressure supersonic flows in the AEDC arc jet
facilities to evaluate performance and survivability. Arc heater flow
fields impinging the test article range in diameter from 2.5 to 60 cm
with gas velocities from 1200 to 2500 m\/sec and test article surface
temperatures from 2000 to 7000 R. Test models vary in shape but are
typically wedge or dome shaped and contained within the diameter of the
arc heater flow. During wedge testing, the material ablates while the
wedge is held in place inside the test rhombus. For nose tip tests, the
test article is moved forward axially as it ablates inside the test
rhombus.  Typical arc heater run durations range from 30 to 1500 seconds
 with up to 8 test articles inserted per run. The high enthalpy flows
generate intense radiating shocks at the interface of the test article.
Also, arc heaters produce high levels of mechanical and acoustic
vibrations and electromagnetic radiation. Specific levels of radiation
and vibration have not been quantified and are dependent on several
parameters related to the arc heater operation and test article
geometry.       Currently, on-line monitoring provides two-dimensional
(2-D) images along the length of the model with emphasis on the position
 of the nose tip. For wedge testing, the current method for determining
recession is to compare pre and post-test measurements. Recession as a
function of time can only be obtained by conducting separate tests with
progressively increasing exposure times.      Quantitative ablation
recession measurements of test article surfaces are essential to define
the performance of candidate materials. A real-time surface mapping
capability for arc jet models is necessary to evaluate critical ablation
 performance of advanced high-temperature materials developed for
various DoD hypersonic weapon systems. The resulting 3-D surface maps
will enable convergence on high-resolution material response
computational models which are essential in the design of thermal
protection systems with adequate safety margins and manageable weight
budgets to enhance vehicle performance and payload. High-resolution
ablation computational models will also enable improved aerodynamic
modeling for vehicles operating in the hypersonic regime and subjected
to ablative shape-change affecting aerodynamics during flight missions.
An innovative approach is sought that will provide a real-time 3-D
imaging system that meets the high temporal and spatial resolution
capability needs. Phase I should provide a comprehensive engineering
analysis and trade study for the optimum approach and a laboratory
feasibility demonstration for the recommended approach. The Phase II
prototype system should provide recession rate monitoring of 10 x 10 x 3
 cm test articles with 3 mm spatial resolution and 30 3-D images per
second with a stretch goal of 1 mm spatial resolution, 100 frames per
second and the possibility of upgrading to 30 x 30 x 3 cm test articles.
  The prototype should be demonstrated in the AEDC Arc Heater
Facilities, or a comparable operational environment.      PHASE I:
Develop an innovative concept for recession rate monitoring for test
articles in the AEDC arc jet facilities and demonstrate the spatial and
temporal resolution for 2-D images.      PHASE II:  Develop and
demonstrate the final prototype in the AEDC Arc Heater Facilities, or a
comparable operational environment.        PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: Diagnostic systems would have direct applicability for
thermal protection system material development for military hypersonic
systems.  Commercial applications include arc jet testing for civil
space access\/reentry such as those currently under development by NASA
and its various contractors.",

Large Scale Hypersonic Wind Tunnels",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop and validate a non-intrusive
 seedless velocity measurement system for instantaneous global
velocimetry at high repetition rates in nitrogen-based hypersonic ground
 test facilities.       DESCRIPTION:  Non-intrusive seedless velocity
measurements are needed in nitrogen-based hypersonic ground test
facilities. Hypersonic T &amp; E facilities provide forces-and-moments
and surface measurements required for the validation of computational
tools used to extrapolate tunnel data to flight conditions. Although
essential to quantify the aero database uncertainties, current
measurement capabilities provide a limited understanding of hypersonic
flow physics. This understanding is essential to develop the improved
computational tools, such as advanced computation fluid dynamics (CFD)
codes, needed to reduce the technical risks of new hypersonic systems
such as boost glide concepts currently being considered for conventional
 prompt global strike (CPGS). Improved knowledge of flow physics
requires instantaneous measurements of the velocity field, a capability
currently not available in hypersonic T &amp; E facilities.       The
goal of this effort is to produce and validate a prototype system for
high-rate, global velocity measurements that does not require seeding in
 nitrogen-based hypersonic wind tunnel facilities. The measurement
system needs to provide instantaneous velocity measurements over the
wide range of conditions achieved in hypersonic wind tunnels. The
accuracy must be equal to or better than +\/- 10 m\/s corresponding to
current state of the art [1] over Mach numbers between 0.3 (blunt
bodies) and 14 (free stream measurements), velocities between 100 m\/s
and 2000 m\/s, temperatures between 50 K and 1800 K  and pressures
between 0.1 and 1000 kPa. The system should also be applicable to
laminar, transitional and turbulent flows with and without shock waves. A
 repetition rate of 1 kHz is needed to obtain converged velocity
fluctuation statistics in a single wind tunnel run. Intrusive probe-type
 devices are not suitable because they disturb the flow field. The size
of hypersonic T &amp; E facilities renders anything other than local
seeding unfeasible based on cost, complexity and safety considerations.
With local seeding, measurements in the shock layer (outside the
boundary layer) or in the stagnation region are not feasible. Moreover,
local seeding can alter the mean flow, introduce unsteady flow
disturbances and requires a sufficient running length to diffuse inside
the boundary layer [2].       Significant progress has been made in
molecular tagging techniques in nitrogen flows, but measurements have
only been performed at a low repetition rate in supersonic nozzle flows
[3]. Measurement uncertainties have yet to be characterized for
canonical hypersonic flows such as oblique shocks, turbulent or laminar
boundary layers. The effect of molecular diffusion on the measurement
uncertainties in turbulent flows also needs to be assessed [4].
Fundamental laboratory research and development efforts are required in
order to develop and demonstrate a robust and accurate, 2-dimensional,
high repetition rate measurement system suitable for the testing and
evaluation of hypersonic systems.      PHASE I:  Demonstrate the
feasibility of a 1-dimensional global seedless velocity measurement for
canonical turbulent hypersonic flows in a small scale supersonic or
hypersonic wind tunnel at a low repetition rate.      PHASE II:  Develop
 a high repetition rate 2-dimensional global seedless velocimetry system
 and demonstrate the prototype measurements for canonical laminar and
turbulent hypersonic flows in a government-furnished hypersonic
wind-tunnel environment. The system can be marketed to customers
involved in any high-speed wind tunnel testing as most facilities
operate with flowfields containing nitrogen.      PHASE III DUAL USE

to the development of next generation hypersonic vehicles and

        "topic_name": "Large Scale Combustion Air Heater Laser Ignition
System",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a laser ignition system for
the CAH at AEDC burning liquid isobutane in air at pressures between 50
psia and 500 psia. Other systems may also be considered as long as no
unsafe gases or liquids such as hydrogen or Triethylaluminum are used.
     DESCRIPTION:  The Aerodynamic and Propulsion Test Unit (APTU) is
used to test advanced supersonic and hypersonic missile systems in a
simulated flight environment. The high total pressures and temperatures
experienced by these flight system as they fly through the atmosphere is
 duplicated in APTU by burning isobutane in high pressure air inside the
 CAH and then expanding the resulting combustion products through a
converging \/ diverging freejet nozzle. In order to initiate the
combustion process in the CAH, an ignition system is required that can
operate over a wide range of combustion chamber pressures (between 50
psia and 500 psia) and also survive the much higher pressures and
temperatures created by the CAH during a test run (up to 2800 psia and
4700 Deg. R). The overall equivalence ratio in the CAH combustion
chamber during the ignition sequence can vary from as low as 0.2 to as
high as 0.7. At no time is the overall ignition sequence equivalence
ratio greater than stoichiometric. The bulk velocity of the air and
atomized fuel is on the order of 100 to 150 ft\/sec during the ignition
sequence, although the flow velocity may be three times as fast since
the ignitor penetration in the combustion chamber wall is located
approximately five inches downstream of the CAH swirler cups and liquid
isobutane fuel injectors. The current CAH ignition system uses two small
 gaseous hydrogen and air torches with the tips of the torches recessed a
 small amount in the combustion chamber wall. The use of gaseous
hydrogen causes significant safety issues in and around the test cell
building, plus the test setup process is procedurally complex.
Additionally, the torch system is limited in its operational range due
to the torch jet's limited ability to penetrate into the combustion
chamber when operating at higher ignition pressures. The majority of the
 two torches are not embedded into the CAH combustion chamber; rather
they are mounted on the outside of the CAH. The part of the system that
penetrates into the CAH has to withstand the full operational range of
the CAH as described above. The part of the system outside the
combustion chamber is exposed to test cell pressures as low as 0.5 psia,
 although the ignition process generally occurs at around 5 psia in the
test cell. A laser-based ignition system is envisioned since it can
focus its energy on the order of six inches into the combustion chamber
under a wide range of conditions. Laser ignition systems have been
experimentally researched for automobile applications, but no commercial
 products are known to exist. Laser systems typically used at APTU are
placed outside the test cell and the beam is routed into the test cell
via fiber optic cable. Several locations just outside the test cell are
available to site hardware for this system. Alternate types of ignition
systems, such as plasma torches or other innovative methods, will also
be considered as long as they are meet stated requirements, are
technically feasible and don't require unsafe gases or liquids.
PHASE I:  Perform a comprehensive evaluation and documentation of the
current state-of-the-art of this technology, identifying existing
applications of the technology. Provide a rigorous description of the
required hardware and software to be employed in developing and
demonstrating a working system.      PHASE II:  Based on Phase I
results, build and demonstrate a prototype laser ignition system using
flowing air as the oxidizer and atomized liquid isobutane as the fuel.
Prototype system must operate with a combustion chamber pressure over 50
 psia. Provide a conceptual design for integrating the system in with
the CAH in place of the existing hydrogen \/ air torches.     PHASE III

 have military and commercial applications for a variety of internal
combustion and gas turbine engines.",

        "topic_name": "Alternative Approach to Contact Type Analogue
Data Slipring",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop an approach for robust and
reliable, non-contact, data transmission of up to 300 channels of
dynamic and steady-state measurements streaming from instrumentation
rotating up to 2048 RPM.       DESCRIPTION:  A robust and reliable data
transmission technology is needed using non-contact methods for up to
300 channels of dynamic and steady state instrumentation for machinery
rotating up to 2048 RPM. The in-field application will be for use on
scaled and full scale powered, wind tunnel helicopter test stands.
Contact type sliprings are currently used to transmit analog
instrumentation signals from the rotating frame down to the stationary
frame and ultimately to the data acquisition system. These contact type
sliprings are notoriously noisy, require frequent cleaning (causing
testing downtime) and have to be specially tuned to very specific RPM
ranges of operation. Standard, typical instrumentation data originates
at Wheatstone bridges and must be transmitted from the rotating frame to
 the stationary frame ultimately ending at a custom data acquisition
system 61 m from sensor location with no direct line of sight.
Wheatstone bridge strain gage measurements are most typical but
transmission should be robust to include pressure transducer
measurements, thermocouples, RTDs and accelerometers. All 300 channels
or rings of the slip ring are identical in terms of ability to handle
voltage and resistance requirements. This allows the slipring to be
configured in any arrangement. This maximizes the utility of the
slipring for different types of gages (i.e. 2 wire or 4 wire gages,
common power vs. individual power gages), as well as rerouting
problematic gages (i.e. +signal goes out and needs to be sent down over a
 different ring). For strain gage measurements, a means to provide
excitation voltage between 5 and 20 volts must be provisioned. Typical
output voltages are on the order of 0  20 mV. Additional requirements
for strain gage measurements is the ability to auto balance or off set
removal of gage drift as well as a precision RCAL function also known as
 shunt calibration in the range of 0  500 Ohms. This RCAL is set by the
amplifiers at the data system and does not require any special
configuration on part of the slipring. Data sampling must be able to be
externally triggered from an azimuth position sensor up to 2048 RPM.
Dynamic data rates must be at least 20 kHz. Transmission across the
rotating frame must be through non-contact means and must simultaneously
 sample up to 300 unique channels of data. The prototype system must be
less than 1.2 m long and no greater than 0.5 m in diameter. The slipring
 should be designed to handle vibrations up to 0.2 IPS and operate in a
temperature range of 10-100 degrees Celsius.       Challenges associated
 with this project: The wind tunnel is an acoustically treated steel
metal frame. High frequency digital transmissions like telemetry systems
 have not worked in the past due to high instances of reflection and

(PSP) for use in Nitrogen Environments of Large-Scale Blowdown
Hypersonic Facilities",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop a temperature-compensated,
pressure sensitive paint system capable of measuring global surface
pressure on test articles in a nitrogen-based, large-scale production
hypersonic ground test facility.       DESCRIPTION:  A innovative
measurement capability is needed for large-scale production hypersonic
facilities that will enable high-resolution global surface pressure
measurements essential for development and validation of modern
computational tools and visualization of complex flow phenomena such as
separation and shock-boundary layer interactions. Understanding of
complex flow phenomena and advancement of high-fidelity computational
tools are critical for development and fielding of future hypersonic
systems such as conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) systems.
Current measurement technologies of this nature are sensitive to oxygen
and therefore limited for use in oxygen wind tunnels. Furthermore,
temperature gradients on the surface of the model are created by the
high Reynolds number\/high Mach number flows in hypersonic test facility
 and can cause localized temperature errors in many pressure measurement
 systems. A solution based upon pressure sensitive paint (PSP)
technology that is a true pressure sensor (i.e. not an oxygen detector)
is envisioned; however, other innovative solutions that meet the needs
will be considered.       The global pressure measurement system is
required to accurately sense model surface pressure in pure nitrogen
over the pressure range from 0.01 psia to 20 psia. If the pressure
measurement technology exhibits temperature sensitivity, it must be
compensated for a nominal temperature range of 50 deg F to 250 deg F to
ensure accurate pressure measurements. Temperature gradients on the
model can be as high as 65 deg F per inch; that is the model is not at a
 uniform temperature. Models are constructed in order to preserve this
temperature gradient so that it may be measured by a global temperature
measurement already in place. If a PSP coating is proposed that is
insulative in nature, higher temperatures will be experienced by the
coating. The coating must be able to survive temperatures up to 350 deg F
 or more depending upon the thermal properties of the coating. The wind
tunnel test articles are at a uniform initial temperature (50 to 70 deg
F) and pressure (~ 0.02 psia) at the start of every run and are located
in the test cell throughout the run (start up and shut down; i.e. not
injected). The usable run time, defined as the time with constant flow
conditions, over which data must be collected range nominally from 0.25
to 5 seconds. The models may be dynamically pitched through an angle of
attack during the usable run time at rates of up to 60 degrees\/sec. The
 response time of the pressure measurement system must be fast enough to
 measure the pressure changes due to pitching over these short run
times. Uncertainty of global pressure measurements should be +\/- 2% of
measured value.        Paints should work with standard stainless steel
wind tunnel test articles and not interfere with the data acquisition of
 discrete model surface instrumentation such as pressure taps, surface
mounted pressure transducers and coaxial thermocouples and internal
strain gage balances. The pressure measurement system should be
compatible with concurrent Schlieren\/Shadowgraph measurements. Coatings
 should produce useful data for up to 2000 seconds of wind-on time.
Coating samples can be tested in the Tunnel 9 facility to assess
adhesion and durability. Factors that can reduce lifespan of the coating
 such as temperature and\/or photodegradation can be simulated in a lab
setting to assess coating useful life span. Existing
temperature-sensitive paint system components such as the 365 nm UV
illumination system for paint excitation and EMCCD cameras may be used
for this system to increase interoperability between the existing TSP
system and a future PSP system. The pressure measurement system should
make use of current optical access ports that utilize BK7 glass if
possible. Ref [1] gives details of the TSP system currently in use at
the AEDC Tunnel 9 facility. Ref [2] reports on a traditional PSP
measurement (oxygen based) adapted to a hypersonic wind tunnel while
simultaneously making TSP measurements. Note that a specialized wind
tunnel model construction using various materials was used to aid these
measurements. That is not desirable for this SBIR. Ref. [3] discusses a
oxygen-based PSP test which used a temperature sensitive paint coating
to correct for temperature changes on the model during the wind tunnel
runs.      PHASE I:  Demonstrate feasibility of temperature compensated
PSP measurements in a nitrogen environment on a stainless steel surface
non-intrusive to standard wind tunnel surface instrumentation such as
pressure transducers and thermocouples. Generate coating manufacturing
and application procedures for use by AEDC personnel.      PHASE II:
Develop and deploy the PSP system in a government-furnished large-scale
nitrogen-based blowdown hypersonic wind tunnel. Test article and wind
tunnel time will be provided by the government. The coating possibly
would be a true pressure sensor and could be used for multiple non-wind
tunnel measurement applications where oxygen is not present or known,
such as combustion or water measurements.      PHASE III DUAL USE
APPLICATIONS: A pressure sensitive measurement system that meets these
requirements could be useful for multiple testing disciplines as the
requirements listed do not prohibit its use in other test facilities or
even for other than wind tunnels.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop an advanced, space antenna
with a steerable, formable beam for GPS satellites.       DESCRIPTION:
GPS satellites currently use fixed beam L-band antennas to provide
hemispherical coverage of the earth. Basically, each signal broadcast
has to be strong enough to be received by user equipment even at the far
 edges of the hemisphere. The current design uses a bank of helical
antennas and can provide enough tuning capability to broadcast at a
higher power toward the edges of the hemisphere. Using this technique,
the received signals can all have roughly the same received power in the
 center of the hemisphere as they do on the edge of the hemisphere.
GPS support for the military is sometimes compromised by weak signals
due to the terrain, active spoofing of the GPS signals, active jamming
of the GPS signals, interference from background radiation, etc. With
the current, fixed beam, hemispherical broadcast approach, there is no
way to increase the GPS signal power to a specific area of interest.
There is a need to be able to focus the GPS broadcast on a specific area
 of interest, steer it to maintain the beam on that area, and provide a
minimum of 5 dB higher signal strength for better general reception,
overcoming a jammer, etc.     This could be accomplished by steering the
 beam in the same manner as phased array radar. A phased array antenna
is typically constructed from multiple Transmit\/Receive (T\/R) elements
 and uses phase shifting to steer the beam electrically. This could also
 be accomplished with an array of stacked patch antennas, an array of
helix antennas, etc. It is desirable to avoid mechanically steering the
beam due to size, weight and power (SWaP) and cost issues. However, a
mechanical beam steering system could be considered if it can be shown
to have equal or better performance, SWaP, and cost as an electrical
beam steering system. Cost goal for this antenna10% over current
antenna, and minimizing electro-magnetic interference (EMI). The
proposed antenna should be suitable for use in a MEO space environment

detection, classification and tracking under challenging communication
environments.       DESCRIPTION:  Current ground-based radar, telescopes
 and space-borne space surveillance assets that comprise the space
surveillance network can be augmented to provide full characterization
of every resident space object (RSO) in orbit from birth-to-death. This
would allow persistent space situational awareness from the knowledge of
 traditional large satellites to picosatellites and orbital debris at
Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO), Medium-Earth-Orbit (MEO), and
Geosynchronous-Earth-Orbit (GEO) altitudes. Innovative approaches are
sought through a combination of new and existing sensing resources with a
 carefully designed distributed sensor management scheme. Current plans
are to augment the radar and optical telescopes in the existing space
surveillance network with a 3.5-m Space Surveillance Telescope (SST),
the Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) system, and the S-band Space
Fence system. These will address the detection, classification and
tracking of space objects, but determining the object"s intent or its
potential capabilities will be difficult when sensing resources are
limited.     As expected, a distributed sensor management scheme that
best utilizes the available sensing resources will improve the
capability of RSO detection, classification and tracking. Particularly,
new sensor management method and associated algorithms are sought to
address the following aspects: i) The goal of sensor management is to
learn the global objective function online and efficiently allocate
sensing assets in a distributed manner with quantifiable performance gap
 to the optimal solution (which is computationally prohibitive to
obtain); ii) The scheme has to consider maneuver detection and nonlinear
 orbital state estimation with explicit models of intentional evasive
motions; iii) The method has to address how to fuse heterogeneous sensor
 measurements and improve the existing constellation from the dynamic
reconfiguration of sensing assets; iv) The solution should follow open
source standard for the software development that can process
heterogeneous sensory data; and v) Data sharing and onboard processing
to reduce bandwidth requirements are subject to unreliable
inter-satellite link (ISL) communications due to high relative angular
velocity between space-based sensors and inter-plane ISL shut-offs at
certain high latitudes. The proposer should develop sensor management
simulation testbed and demonstrate agile sensor scheduling capability in
 orbital maneuver detection and collision alert.      PHASE I:  Develop
and demonstrate feasibility of the proposed sensor management method and
 algorithms with realistic space surveillance scenarios. Model the
intent of object"s maneuver for accurate early collision alert. Quantify
 the benefit of dynamic reconfiguration for tracking multiple LEO and
GEO objects of various sizes, attributes and maneuver capabilities.

algorithms, and suitable proof-of-concept. Demonstrate potential and
feasibility of the algorithm(s) using simulated data generated by 3
geographically dispersed and cooperative ground and space-based radar
and electro-optical sites. Characterize algorithm performance using
metrics\/trade parameters. Phase II efforts should include ensuring
compatibility with JMS component interfaces.      PHASE III DUAL USE

utility, both for civil and military use, the number of digital signals
has more than doubled from the original system. A flexible navigation

GPS carriers, especially for L1 and L2. Additionally, the higher signal
powers for modernized GPS has increased the risk of multipaction.
Careful consideration is required to ensure sufficient margin to support

object characterization",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop algorithms to enable rapid
cataloging and characterization of space objects in support of space
situation awareness and orbital safety.       DESCRIPTION:  Effective
space control and situational awareness require continuous and accurate
tracking of space objects with a limited number of sensing platforms.
The U.S. Air Force Space Surveillance Network (SSN) is a critical
foundation of U.S. space operations. It is a network of sensors
scattered across the globe which provide both tracking and
identification data on objects in Earth orbits. The SSN provides the
information to the Joint Space Operations Center (JSPOC), which has the
mission to detect, track, identify, and catalog all man-made objects in
Earth orbits. Approximately 500,000 individual observations are
collected each day by the SSN. The SSN observations are used to maintain
 the satellite catalog, predict atmospheric re-entry of space objects,
catalog new launches, detect satellite maneuvers, and safeguard
important satellites such as the International Space Station. Due to
uncertainties in position determination and the inability to track
objects continuously the problem of maintaining situational awareness of
 all space orbiting objects is challenging. On a daily basis, observed
objects must be correlated with objects within the space catalog and
accurately characterized. Due to orbital decay, maneuvers, and the
generation of new objects there is a high degree of uncertainty in the
characterization of space objects and a need exists for the timely and
accurate cataloging of objects. A number of algorithmic techniques are
used to correlate observed objects with catalog objects and provide
catalog updates. Due to uncertainties the processing of uncorrelated
targets is a time consuming and challenging problem. With the rise of
multi-sensor fusion and exploitation techniques an opportunity exists
for obtaining improved comprehensive and continuous space domain
awareness of activities, systems, and the environment. There is growing
demand for the development as well as the verification and validation of
 the emerging decision support algorithms and systems toward space
catalog processing which will lead to enhanced situational awareness. To
 compound the technical challenges, any uncertainties in sensor models,
object identification templates, or object motion models may cause
significant degradation in the tracking accuracy of the existing
state-of-the-art methods such as Joint Probabilistic Data Association
Filter (Joint PDAF), Joint-Belief PDAF, and Interactive Multiple Model
PDAF. The focus of this topic solicitation is to address the problem of
cataloging and processing of satellite objects. Improved algorithms and
methodologies are sought which will improve correlation of observed
objects with cataloged objects. Techniques must account for dynamic data
 cluttering to provide non-standard measurement updates that effectively
 estimate models of unknown, dynamically evolving data sets, such as
background clutter, so that 1) the detection and clutter characteristics
 for participating space-based sensors can be forecasted and 2) advanced
 multi-object filtering to detect and tracking of multiple nonstandard
objects obscured by unknown, dynamically changing clutter. Key technical
 challenges for mathematical footings and technology foundations will
include constructive methods and efficient analysis that can extract
clutters for multi-object filters of detecting and tracking non-standard
 objects in difficult environments which are obscured by unknown
background clutters. Innovative solutions are sought for efficient
filtering implementation for both known and object-dependent clutter and
 unknown probability of detection and effective fusion of local tracks
from local object states subject to distributed sensing and tracking
situations whereby local trackers may have different models of object
dynamics.      PHASE I:  Using a representative space catalog and space
environment, develop and demonstrate a set of algorithms that would
provide rapid correlation of observed objects with cataloged objects.
Techniques should demonstrate improvements in uncertainty and
demonstrate scalability. Demonstrate a proof-of-concept.     PHASE II:
Refine the detailed designs for the Phase I space catalog\/environment

low-cost high-density Radiation-Hardened (RH) Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)
continues to be a severely limiting factor in the design of systems for
use in space environments. Present solutions rely on inefficient
hardening techniques, such as radiation hardening by design (RHBD),
which are implemented either in layout or in the application
architecture and not in the fabrication process. Many of these solutions
 are based on redundancy and result in a performance penalty. Moreover,
most aerospace applications preclude the use of moving parts, such as
the one in a hard disk. Thus, an ultra-high density storage solution is
completely lacking. Efforts over the last two decades to develop a
practical NVM solution for space have fallen short of the density and
performance needs. A radiation-hard NVM that can achieve high density is
 needed.      Commercial NVMs have greatly increased in density while

Generator for GPS",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop an on-orbit reprogrammable
digital waveform generator (ORDWG) for GPS satellites.
DESCRIPTION:  The Global Positioning System (GPS) space segment is
currently comprised of 31 satellites in a Medium Earth Orbit at an
altitude of approximately 20,000km. Each satellite has an on-board
waveform generator to create, combine and output several signals for
terrestrial users to determine their geographic location and synchronize
 timing. These signals contain navigation data, Selective Availability
(S\/A) and Anti-Spoofing (A\/S) capabilities, and Pseudo-Random Noise
(PRN) codes to produce the appropriate signals for continual
transmission.     The PRN codes are the Coarse Acquisition (C\/A),
Civilian (C), Encrypted Precision (P\/Y), Military (M) codes, and Safety
 of Life (SoL) codes. These codes, when combined with the carrier
frequency, are called Pseudo-Random Noise (PRN) because taken
individually they look like noise. However, they are generated by a
known algorithm and do repeat. For the C\/A code, the PRN pattern
repeats every millisecond, however, for the P(Y) code, the PRN pattern
repeats every 267 days. The PRN pattern is unique for each satellite in
order to allow the entire constellation to operate on the same
frequencies. These codes are combined with a navigation message, which
contains vehicle unique Telemetry, Clock, Ephemeris, and GPS
constellation Almanac data.     The combined codes and messages are
transmitted in several frequency bands: L1 (1575.42MHz), L2
(1227.60MHz), and L5 (1176.54MHz). The L1 frequency includes the L1C\/A,
 L1C, L1P(Y) and L1M codes. L2 frequency transmission includes the L2C,
L2P\/Y, and L2M codes. The Safety of Life (SoL) codes are broadcast only
 on the L5 frequency band.     In addition, these waveforms contain two
methods for denial of accuracy to civilian receivers: Selective
Availability (S\/A) and Anti-Spoofing (A\/S). S\/A is the injection of
intentional errors into the waveform to decrease precision, while A\/S
uses an encryption method to decrease the likelihood of false signals.
Waveform generation is becoming more complex as the GPS system matures
with additional functions being added, anti-jamming routines changing,
etc. Currently, there is no practical way to modify the waveform
generation routine on-board the satellite.     There is a need to
develop a digital waveform generator that can be reprogrammed only from
the GPS Ground Control Segment with new waveform generation routines
while the satellite is in orbit. This new ORDWG shall produce and be
capable of modifying all current L1 PRN codes, be able to produce up to
10 different code signals, be able to change the navigation message data
 rates, combine the PRN codes and navigation messages with no losses or
interference, and meet or exceed current applicable GPS specification
requirements. This new waveform generator design should also include
reductions in Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaPC) to the greatest
extent possible.      Proposals should clearly indicate how the result

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Create a revolutionary space-based
architecture to better sustain U.S. military Global Positioning Systems
in the 21st Century.      DESCRIPTION:  The Global Positioning System
(GPS) is a space-based satellite position, navigation, and timing system
 that provides position, velocity, and time in nearly all weather
conditions, anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed
 line of sight to four or more GPS satellites. The system provides
critical capabilities to military, civil and commercial users around the
 world. Advances in technology and new demands on the existing system
have since led to efforts to modernize all three segments of the GPS
system.     As effective as these advancements are, new concepts are
needed for next-generation position, navigation, and timing (PNT)
systems. GPS spectrum is increasingly congested, other nations have
introduced alternative space-based PNT systems, and the vulnerabilities
of GPS have become a liability as potential U.S. adversaries,
terrorists, and criminal organizations seek to deny users access to the
GPS signals.     In addition to the emergence of near-peer level PNT
systems launched by other nations, the current GPS system carries with
it several operational and sustainment challenges. Among these
challenges are the high costs, susceptibility to jamming, and limited
availability in many important environments. The primary cost driver for
 the GPS system is the need to maintain a worldwide constellation of
satellites of ever-increasing complexity. Jamming vulnerability stems
from the fact that GPS signals arrive about 20 dB below the noise floor.
 Limited availability occurs wherever the low-power signal is
obstructed, such as indoors or underground, or in urban and natural
canyons.     In recent decades, significant progress has been made in
both terrestrial and space-based PNT technologies. The emergence of
miniature inertial measuring units, chip-scale atomic clocks, and
positioning using signals of opportunity have changed the way we think
about the PNT problem. Smartphone systems are an example of emergent
PNT, computing position using intelligent combinations of GPS, cell
tower triangulation, Wi-Fi, and other systems such as GLONASS.     This
topic area seeks solutions that can be extensions of the existing
constellation and are compatible with existing GPS end-user hardware.
Specific outcomes sought in this topic include:   - Reductions in
sustainment costs for the GPS constellation   - Enhanced signal security
   - Enhanced robustness of the constellation   - Reduced time to first
fix   - Enhanced accuracy   - Enhanced canyon and urban canyon
performance   - Reduced jammer susceptibility      Possible solutions
for this topic area include but should not be limited to alternative
constellation designs and orbital geometries, alternative frequencies,
hosted PNT payloads on other space systems, and ground or space-based
augmentations. Specific innovations at the component, subsystem, or
payload level can be considered in this topic area to the extent that
they enable fundamental changes in orbital configurations,
architectures, or costs.      PHASE I:  Design a revolutionary
architecture to sustain U.S. military GPS systems. Develop concepts for
deployed infrastructure (space, air, or terrestrial-based) and
associated user equipment. Identify key functional performance
parameters and associated enabling technologies required to realize
conceived revolutionary approach. Deliver a credible technology
development plan for Phase II effort(s).      PHASE II:  Design and

Phase II.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Design and construct a
limited operational system based on the work in Phase I and Phase II.

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Create a disruptive,
fundamentally-new military navigation architecture to provide
game-changing advantages for U.S. forces.       DESCRIPTION:  GPS is a
space-based satellite navigation system that provides location and
timing information in many weather conditions, anywhere on or near the
Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS
satellites. The system provides critical capabilities to military and
civil users. Advances in technology and new demands on the existing
system have led to efforts to modernize the GPS system and implement the
 next generation of GPS III satellites and next-generation Operational
Control System (OCX) (2). As effective as these advances are, new
concepts are needed for next-generation position, navigation, and timing
 (PNT) systems. Relevant environments are congested, contested, and
competitive and the PNT solutions will subsequently need to account for
more difficult environment. Architectures are sought which have the
promise of changing the value proposition for military users. Different
physical processes are sought and approaches which profoundly change the
 cost, sustainment needs, vulnerabilities, performance levels, or
operational constraints on users. Within this topic area, there is no
need to meet the full suite of existing GPS program requirements.
Performance requirements are specifically removed if the proposed
solution promises one or more game changing variations in capability.
Compromise on performance levels trading for fundamentally new
capability may be considered in any area including accuracy, user
hardware SWaP, all-weather 24-hour operation, or global coverage.  To
encourage more disruptive thinking, this topic area also removes the
requirement to be backwards compatible with existing hardware and
software and\/or to be compatible with and interoperable with existing
GPS constellations. Examples of game-changing capabilities should not be
 limited to but may include the ability to:   - Operate in a completely
RF-jammed environment   - Operate without access to space assets   - Use
 existing natural or man-made radiation sources as fiduciaries
There is no requirement in this topic area to include space-based assets
 but the use of existing or new space-based assets is permitted as an
enhancement. Aerial, ground-based, sea-based and subterranean assets may
 be considered. Systems that work only for air, ground, sea, or space
navigation or for only a subset of these will be considered if they
provide other game-changing capabilities. Systems with minimal
infrastructure cost needs are specifically desired, but exquisite
capability requiring extensive infrastructure will also be considered.
Systems that specifically require access to the existing GPS system in
order to function at all should not be proposed under this topic.
Possible solutions for this topic include but should not be limited to:
  - completely self-contained units that use a combination of natural
and artificial radiation sources in combination with inertial
measurement system,   - architectures that use multi-mode measurement of
 man-made and natural landmarks, airborne transceivers and timers,   -
celestial navigation using optical or other forms of radiation, and   -
modulation or passive measurement of other natural or artificial types
of radiation, including acoustics, magnetic fields, Whistler waves.
 We will consider the merits of any approach that has the prospect of
reasonably near-term application and is based on well-established basic
physical principles and technical means. Architectures with limited
(special) applications and little or no global infrastructure will be
considered as well as systems with regional or theater-level
infrastructure needs. The use of signaling systems and modalities that
are unexpected and\/or undetectable and un-jammable is a possible
positive feature.      PHASE I:  Design a"Disruptive Navigation
Architecture"based on feasible yet novel and disruptive technical
approaches that revolutionize U.S. military navigation capabilities for
the 21st Century. Identify key functional performance parameters and
associated enabling technologies required to realize alternate
navigation architectures. Deliver a credible technology development plan
 for Phase II effort(s).     PHASE II:  Develop baseline performance
and\/or sustainment costs estimates that show advantages relative to the
 existing, evolving GPS-based architecture. Develop higher-fidelity,
end-to-end architecture models, development roadmaps, and enabling
component technologies for the proposed new disruptive navigation
architecture.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Design and construct
 a limited operational system based on the work in Phase I and Phase II.
 This system may incorporate military GPS information (PRS, M Code), but
 should not rely on them, and be capable of operating when they are not
available.",

        "topic_name": "Gear Coatings for Loss of Lubrication
Application",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate gear coatings
 in order to increase the endurance of helicopter transmissions
operating after loss of primary oil flow.  The objective is to develop
low cost, low friction, highly reliable coating that is capable of
allowing a transmission to run for 45 minutes in a loss of lubrication
condition.    DESCRIPTION: Under normal rotorcraft operations, flowing
lubricant keeps heat generation low and removes excess heat away from
the gearboxes. In an oil-out condition, where the primary oil flow no
longer exists, the rotating gear components generate more heat which
leads to gearbox failure. Recent transmission oil loss incidents have
caused emergency landings as well as fatalities.    Army rotorcraft have
 specific loss of lubrication requirements for drive systems, as noted
in ADS-50-PRF. The drive systems are required to operate after loss of
primary oil flow for a minimum of 30 minutes at cruise conditions
(approximately 50% power rating). The Army desires the ability to run
for a longer period of time after a loss of lubrication condition to
improve aircraft survivability. One way to meet and exceed this
requirement is to employ the use of an emergency oil system. This
auxiliary system takes over during the loss of primary oil flow, but
requires the aircraft to always carry around the additional associated
weight. This additional weight reduces aircraft payload and range.
This topics goal is to develop a technology that will allow a gearbox to
 survive for at least 45 minutes at a 50% power rating, without the need
 for an auxiliary lubrication system. In order to meet this goal, an
innovative gear coating approach is desired that will allow the gears to
 run at elevated temperatures for a longer period of time before
failure. The gear coating technology developed under this effort should
be designed to be affordable, capable of application to typical aircraft
 gear steels (AISI 9310, X-53, etc.), and compatible with typical gear
manufacturing processes. Candidate coatings must be extremely durable,
as gears are expected to operate without failure for many thousands of
hours (order 109 cycles) in a lubricated gearbox. The coating should be
designed so that it does not wear at temperatures below 400 degrees
Fahrenheit, and will only degrade during oil out conditions. The coating
 should be between 1-40 micron"s thick, entirely cover each gear tooth,
and not be detrimental to gear performance in any way. If the coating
process results in increased surface roughness, a method to restore the
original surface topography should be addressed.       PHASE I: Develop
and conduct a feasibility demonstration of the proposed coating
technology.  This may include modeling of the coating performance, and
coupon level experimental testing. This demonstration shall validate the
 solutions for identified critical technical challenges.       PHASE II:
 Contractors are encouraged to collaborate with an Army rotorcraft OEM
during Phase II. The contractor shall further develop the gear coating
based on the Phase I effort for implementation on an Army rotorcraft.
The capabilities of the advanced coating will be validated by performing
 a loss of lubrication test in a full scale rotorcraft gearbox. This
testing shall validate the ability of the coating to increase loss of
lubrication performance.     PHASE III: This technology could be
integrated in a broad range of military\/civilian aircraft where loss of
 primary oil flow is a concern. The potential exists to integrate and
transition this coating into existing and future Army gearboxes, such as
 those for the Apache, Chinook, Black Hawk, and Kiowa Warrior.",

Rotorcraft",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate innovative
and advanced concepts for seat restraint systems, which will be
intuitively easier and faster to use under any adverse conditions and
can be readily integrated into existing forward, aft, and side-facing
troop seats in military rotorcraft while providing the necessary
protection requirements to prevent injuries during crash.
DESCRIPTION: Unlike a pilot who uses the seat restraint system so
frequently that its use becomes a matter of habit, troops encumbered
with varying types and quantities of equipment in military rotorcraft
are often not familiar with the troop seat restraint systems.  As a
result, they may not use the restraint systems or don them incorrectly
especially under adverse conditions like under enemy fire or in the
dark.  However, it is crucial for the troops and passengers to don the
restraint systems quickly and properly in their troop seats to prevent
injuries during crash.  It has been reported that current 4-point and
5-point seat restraint systems are so difficult for troops to use that
in many cases, the crew chief must assist troops in finding the straps
and donning them properly.  This difficulty results from lack of
familiarity, equipment worn by the troop, which blocks visibility,
system complexity, and straps that get misplaced down between or behind
troop seats.    PHASE I: Develop innovative conceptual designs for seat
restraint systems for troops in military rotorcraft, which will be
intuitively easier and faster to use while providing the required
protection to prevent injuries during crash and meeting the ingress and
egress requirements.  Required Phase I deliverables include monthly
progress reports and a final technical report.    PHASE II: Upon
successful completion of Phase I effort, conduct detail design,

include bi-monthly progress reports, test plans, test reports, design
review packages, and a final technical report.    PHASE III: Optimize
the design and the seat integration resulting from Phase II effort and
conduct necessary performance, environmental, user-acceptance testing in
 an operational environment.     The innovative and advanced seat
restraint systems for troops in Army rotorcraft can be applied to troop
seats for other military platforms as well as the mine-blast protected

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate a paint
additive with associated non-destructive interrogation device to detect
the very early\/insipient formation of corrosion.    DESCRIPTION:
Corrosion is a chronic problem for all of DoD and significant funding is
 spent annually detecting, repairing and in some cases replacing
aircraft components. Inspection for corrosion is currently accomplished
visually by maintenance personnel. Thus, the corrosion is usually only
detected when it has formed and is causing structural damage to the
effected components. In an effort to enhance corrosion detection
practices, corrosion sensing devices that infer the possible formation
of corrosion from monitored environmental parameters have been
investigated. Sensors to detect the electrolyte catalyst that leads to
corrosion formation have also been examined. However, in both cases,
these sensors only monitor for corrosion in the immediate area they are
installed. Thus, these corrosion detection approaches are greatly
limited. It is anticipated that inspection for corrosion with a paint
additive\/non-destructive interrogation system would allow for discovery
 of nominal corrosion that can be easily treated before any damage
occurs.    This topic's goal is to develop and demonstrate a paint
additive with associated non-destructive interrogation device to detect
the very early\/insipient formation of corrosion. The additive must be
able to function\/survive in the harsh internal environments. The
non-destructive interrogating device should be as small and lightweight
as possible and have the capability to transverse in small areas. The
additive\/non-destructive interrogation system should be affordable
(Threshold: $10K unit cost, Objective $5K unit cost) and readily
producible. The paint additive must be compatible with current coating
systems and not interfere with pretreatments. Camouflage of the aircraft
 must not be compromised in any way.    PHASE I: Develop and conduct a
feasibility demonstration of the proposed paint
additive\/non-destructive interrogation technology. This may include
modeling of the additive performance, and coupon level experimental
testing. The paint additive must be compatible with current coating
systems and not interfere with pretreatments. Camouflage of the aircraft
 must not be compromised in any way. The paint additive system will be
graded for performance with metrics to include sensitivity of the paint
additive to indicate corrosion when interrogated, the total area the
interrogator head is able cover when investigating for Corrosion
(Threshold: 5 mm squared, Objective: 10 mm squared), and the flexibility
 (ability to change angles) of the interrogator to reach difficult to
access areas of the aircraft. This demonstration shall validate
identified critical technical challenges.    PHASE II: The contractor
shall further develop the paint additive\/non-destructive interrogation
device based on the Phase I effort for implementation on an Army
rotorcraft. The capabilities of the advanced paint
additive\/non-destructive interrogation system will be validated by
conducting testing using panels representative of aircraft manufactured
structural sections. This testing shall validate the ability of the
paint additive\/non-destructive interrogation device to detect corrosion
 through the paint at the lowest level possible. Testing should include
accelerated exposure to corrosion formation on the panels. The
contractor shall address manufacturing\/formulation of the new paint and
 additive, as well as identify phase III path ahead for military
qualification.    PHASE III: This technology could be integrated in a
broad range of military\/civilian aircraft where corrosion is a concern.

        "topic_name": "Electrostatic Methods for Improved Separation of
Fine Sand\/Dust Particles in Turbine Engines",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate novel,
electrostatic methods for improved fine sand\/dust particle separation
in turbine engines.    DESCRIPTION:  Sand\/Dust particles have
significant detrimental effects on turbine engine performance and
durability causing impact on mission effectiveness and sustainment
costs. Fine sand particles melt in the combustor and solidify (turn to
glass) on turbine vanes, blades, and other hot section components
thereby disturbing flow characteristics and reducing efficiency. Glass
releases during engine cycles\/transients and can damage downstream
components. These fine particles also can get into the turbine cooling
flow and plug up cooling passages in turbine blades and vanes causing
premature oxidation. The above effects reduce turbine performance,
increase turbine temperatures, and shorten the life of hot section
components resulting in more frequent engine overhauls. Fine particles
(1-80 micron size) are much more difficult to separate from the main
flow stream because they tend to more easily follow the flow and are not
 easily filtered by inertial effects. The goal of this program is to
improve separation of these fine particles via novel electrostatic
methods (i.e., attraction\/deflection of particles into the scavenge
flow or conglomeration of the particles into larger masses which can
more easily be filtered\/scavenged) to enable more effective aerodynamic
 separation techniques. The goal metric is to improve fine particle
(1-80 micron size) separation efficiency from current level of about 70%
 in current inertial separators to greater than 90%. The electrostatic
system design effort should include calculations\/modeling and\/or
subcomponent tests to determine the most effective methods along with
the required electrostatic charges and particle velocity limits to
effectively conglomerate\/deflect the sand\/dust particles for
subsequent aerodynamic filtration. A key technical challenge will be the
 ability to effectively achieve electrostatic conglomeration\/deflection
 of fine sand particles in a turbine engine realistic airflow
environment. Another key technical goal to be addressed will be the
ability to integrate the proposed electrostatic separation method into
the engine with no increase in pressure drop and no more than a 15%
increase in filtration system weight and volume relative to the proposed
 baseline engine filtration system. The size and weight of the proposed
system will be dependent on the intended engine application. Proposed
electrostatic filtration concepts can be applied to various parts of the
 engine wherever most effective. System development and validation
efforts should include component testing to demonstrate the
electrostatic system effectiveness as a function of inlet particle size
distributions, where inlet to exit particle sizes will be evaluated.
Small businesses are encouraged to work with major engine manufacturers
to ensure effective application of proposed technologies into future gas
 turbine engine configurations.     PHASE I: Key components of proposed
electrostatic filtration methods should be developed and validated to
substantiate the feasibility to achieve improved fine particle
separation in turbine engines. Fine particles (1-80 micron size) are
much more difficult to separate from the main flow stream because they
tend to more easily follow the flow and are not easily filtered by
inertial effects. The goal metric is to improve fine particle (1-80
micron size) separation efficiency from current level of about 70% in
current inertial separators to greater than 90%.     PHASE II: Fully
develop, fabricate, and demonstrate the electrostatic filtration system
in a ground test environment to validate improved fine particle (0-80
microns) separation efficiency from current level of 70% to greater than
 90% in turbine engines, while not debiting the coarse sand separation
capability. The current efficiency levels are typically 90%-97% for
coarse sands (80-1000 microns).     PHASE III: Phase III options should
include endurance testing and integration of the enhanced electrostatic
filtration system into a turbine engine system to demonstrate the
performance of the system with engine sand ingestion ground testing. The
 resulting technology will enable significantly enhanced durability of
hot section components of future advanced turbine engines operating in
sand and dust environments. Both the military and commercial aircraft
applications are likely to encounter such an environment and thereby
will derive benefit from this technology. This improvement in
electrostatic technology should improve fuel consumption and power
density. It may reduce overall maintenance costs.",

the power source shall be no larger than 2 by 2 by 1 inches; and,  (8)
the power source shall weigh no more than 2.5 ounces (no more than 70
grams).    For reference, current technology, ultra-low power
microcontrollers require 50 microamps to 200 microamps per MHz clock

 meets the requirements described in the description section. Contractor
 shall provide the government with a report describing the test
method(s) and test results.    Contractor shall have an independence

Batteries are problematic in electronic health monitoring systems.
Current batteries do not have more that 5 to 10 years of shelf life over
 the industrial temperature range. A new battery, with a 20 year
operating\/shelf life would eliminate replacing batteries every 5 years.
     Low power consumer electronics, industrial control, oil and gas

        "topic_name": "Ultra Low Power Electronic Health Monitoring
System",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Research and develop an electronic
health monitoring system with ultra-low power sensors and signal
processing chain(s).     DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this SBIR is to
research and develop ultra-low power sensors and signal processing
(analog and digital) chains for electronic health monitoring
applications. Current electronic health monitoring systems spend most of
 their time in an ultra-low power sleep mode. We are interested in an
electronic health monitoring system that can run continuously on less
than 100 microamps current.     A typical health monitoring system
consists of a sensor, analog signal processing, an analog-to-digital
converter, microcontroller and digital signal processing. We are
interested in an electronic health monitoring system with less than 100
microwatts continuous power consumption. A low power sensor by itself
does not meet the low power system requirement for this topic.     Due
to the low current requirement, this topic is for a wired health
monitoring system. Offeror may propose a wireless system; however, the
offeror still must meet the 100 microamp average current requirement.
 For example, a typical pressure sensor may output a voltage, current or
 frequency proportional to the applied pressure. Analog signal
processing may be required to appropriately scale the sensor's output
signal for an analog-to-digital converter. Digital signal processing may
 be required to linearize the pressure transfer function.     For
example, a typical industrial pressure sensor outputs a current. A gain
stage is required to convert the sensor output current to a 0 to 3 volt
range for a 12 bit analog-to-digital converter. A digital signal
processing step is required to convert the 12 bit digital code number 0
through 4095 (0x0000 through 0x0fff) to a 0.0 to 100.0 psi (0.0 to 7.00
bar) floating point number. The entire sensor system is required to be
ultra-low power.     Missiles may be placed in long term storage for 10
to 20 years or longer. Health monitoring systems require, extremely low
power sensors and extremely low power analog and digital signal
processing to achieve more than 10 years of operation. Batteries to
power health monitoring systems are a separate concern. This SBIR topic
is not seeking any battery research or development. This SBIR topic is
not seeking any chemical sensor development.    PHASE I: Contractor
shall research the feasibility of developing an ultra-low power
electronic health monitoring system with less than 100 microwatts
continuous power consumption. We are interested in sensors for humidity,
 temperature, rate of temperature change, pressure, and battery charge
level (e.g. percentage of battery life remaining). Contractor shall
select 4 of 5 sensors for the health monitoring system.     The
technical merit for the phase I proposals will be evaluated based on the
 following criteria: 25% weighting for sensor and sensor performance,
25% for analog and digital signal processing chains, and 50% for low
power. Phase I proposals are required to address the three criteria
above.     For the Phase I proposal, the contractor shall provide a
system block diagram and describe the system operation:   (1) the
proposed sensors,   (2) the analog signal processing chain(s),   (3) the
 analog-to-digital converter(s),   (4) digital signal processing
chain(s), and   (5) any post digital processing, and\/or linearization
required to convert the digitized sensor values to measurement values
(for example V\/m, Pascals, Kelvins, etc. in floating point or fixed
point).    To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed health monitor
 system, the contractor may develop models, simulations, and\/or
prototypes.    The contractor shall provide midterm and final reports.
The final report shall describe health monitor system (1) operation, (2)
 estimated system performance, (3) estimated power consumption for each
individual element, and the total system power, (4) estimated operating
temperature range, (5) estimated operational vibration limits, (6)
estimated operational lifetime, and (7) estimated non-powered lifetime
(shelf lifetime).    PHASE II: Contractor shall develop the electronic
health monitoring system based on the phase I research. The electronic
health monitoring system (without battery) shall have a volume smaller
than (1 x 1 x 0.2 inches) and weigh less than 0.36 ounce (10 grams).
 Contractor shall have an independent source, with government
concurrence, test and evaluate the performance of the electronic health
monitoring system. Contractor shall provide a copy of the test and
evaluation report to the government. Contractor shall provide 2
electronic health monitoring systems to the government point of contact
for test and evaluation. Contractor shall provide a preliminary
datasheet for electronic health monitoring system. Contractor shall
provide a final report describing the electronic health monitoring
system. Contractor shall provide the government a 2 day on site training
 for the electronic health monitoring system.    PHASE III: Military,
aerospace, medical and industrial applications are always looking for
lower weight, and lower power technologies. Automotive applications
require rugged, low power electronic health monitoring systems for
diagnostics and prognostics.   Military systems (missiles, aircraft,
ships, and vehicles) are interested in ultra-low power electronic health
 monitoring systems for system monitoring, diagnostics and prognostics.
For the medical industry, battery powered systems like heart pacemakers,
 blood glucose monitors, etc. would benefit from ultra-low power
electronic health monitoring systems.",

        "topic_name": "Ceramic Matrix Composite Materials for
Transpiration Cooling",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  To develop and demonstrate ceramic
matrix composite materials for missile applications with transpiration
cooling.    DESCRIPTION: The advantages of external transpiration walls
for cooling and drag reduction of hypersonic air vehicles are well
known[1,2]. These same advantages have been applied to internal gas
turbine combustor walls[3] and should equally apply to airbreathing
missiles  ducted rockets, ramjets, and particularly scramjet powered air
 vehicles.    Transpiration refers to the transport of fluid through a
porous wall at near zero momentum; i.e., an"oozing"or"bleeding"process.
This transpiration cooling process provides for a layer of fluid to
insulate and convect heat away from the porous wall and, additionally,
reduce the viscous drag of the cross flow.    The application of
transpiration cooling to missile systems has been inhibited, at least in
 part, to the added complexity plus the high cost and time required to
fabricate porous transpiration walls from heat resistant metals.  Even
for scramjet engine applications where the internal viscous drag may
well exceed the external form or pressure drag, the advantages of the
technology have largely been deferred while addressing the fundamental
problems of engine design and operation. Ceramic matrix composites
(CMC)[4], however, may well provide an alternative to the tedious and
expensive production process for metal transpiration surfaces.
Ceramic matrix composites offer unique properties for high temperature
applications. Most commonly proposed as a structural material for rocket
 nozzles, motor cases, and airframes, they should provide adequate
strength over the required range of operating temperatures with the
potential for weight savings and increased propellant loading since
insulation materials may be reduced or eliminated.  Indeed, those
strength and temperature characteristics are now being exploited for
uncooled turbine shrouds and high pressure turbine static seals for
advanced turbojet engine designs[5,6]. More uniquely, in an unfilled
form, these porous ceramic matrix composites could prove ideal as
transpiration materials for combustor walls or external air vehicle
surfaces.     CMCs such as Carbon (C), silicon carbide (SiC), and
alumina (Al2O3) are often manufactured by a process that results in a
highly porous product after the first step (often as much as 20%
porosity). In subsequent steps they are filled and processed so as to
reduce the porosity. The reduction in porosity improves both structural
and high temperature properties which are beneficial for the
applications mentioned above.  CMCs with porosity may have applications
for transpiration cooling but their properties need further
investigation to determine the optimum combination of porosity,
strength, and temperature capabilities. Hence, the technology for
ceramic matrix composite production is now well established but
innovation will be required for transpiration boundaries in terms of
fabrication and properties to include thermo-structural properties,
containment fixtures, porosity, and fluid flow characteristics.    What
is needed then is a clear demonstration of porous CMCs for missile
transpiration cooling applications, specifically for scramjet engine
internal combustor walls and for hypersonic air-vehicle external walls.
Success in those applications should assure equal success in many
commercial applications as well. Metrics for success would be an area
weight of half that for a fabricated steel transpiration surface at
one-fifth the cost. Additionally, the unfilled CMC material should show a
 degradation of no more than fifty percent for any time period at
elevated temperatures.    PHASE I:  Innovative technical approaches will
 be formulated leading to the development of ceramic matrix composite
materials for transpiration cooling as a marketable product. Preliminary
 analysis of test article concepts will be performed for structural and
thermal requirements.     PHASE II: To demonstrate and validate the
technical approaches of Phase I, plans will be formulated for the
completion of two ground based tests in a Government test facility[7].
The first test will be of a CMC transpiration cooled and\/or fueled
planar wall in an existing supersonic combustion duct[8]. The second
test will be of a CMC transpiration cooled external wall section in an
exiting conical body at hypersonic velocities[2].  Additionally,
prototype ceramic matrix composite coupons for these tests will be
delivered to the Government for high temperature strength testing and
fluid flow characterization.     These two tests will require both
planar and conical CMC transpiration surfaces. The combustion duct will
employ two planar transpiration walls of approximately 0.10 m width by
1.2 m length. The 10.5 degree (half angle) conical body will use a
transpiration wall of approximately 0.76 m in length with a base
diameter of 0.34 m. Additional geometric details are given in references
 1,2, and 8.    The two ground based tests will be run to validate the
use of ceramic matrix composite materials for transpiration cooled
combustor and air vehicle walls.  Testing will require detailed analysis
 for thermal and structural requirements, fabrication of the required
composite transpiration wall materials, installation in the existing
combustor and conical tunnel model, and completion of the ground
testing. Deliverables will consist of the resultant test data to
demonstrate structural integrity and aerothermal characteristics of the
transpiration cooled installations.    Metrics for success in these
ground based tests will be (1) structural integrity for a test time of
50 ms with and without transpiration, (2) a reduction of viscous surface
 drag by a factor of ten with active transpiration, and (3) a reduction
in surface heat flux by a factor of ten with active transpiration.
PHASE III:  The end result of this research effort will be a validated
approach for the production of composite materials for transpiration
cooling as a marketable product.      For military applications, this
technology is directly applicable to all rocket propulsion missile
systems as an advanced material for nozzles, motor cases, and airframes
with the additional application to combustors for airbreathing missiles.
     Gas turbine applications, both military and commercial, to include
both turbo shaft and turbojet variants have already employed CMC
materials for combustor walls and variants of transpiration cooling for
combustor walls and turbine blades[9,3]. This advancement for
transpiration with porous CMC materials will have direct application to
this large commercial arena.      For strictly commercial applications,
this technology is directly applicable to all commercial launch systems
such as the NASA Aries, and the Delta and Atlas families.  Additionally
many industries utilizing high temperature combustors  petroleum,
cement, power generation, and food processing to name but a few  could
employ this technology.",

        "topic_name": "Wide Field of View Primary Optic for Semi-Active
Laser Sensor",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop, investigate, and validate a
 novel optical primary optic for a wide field of view semi-active laser
spot-tracking missile seeker based on a biologically-inspired compound
eye for use in the near-infrared spectrum. Provide effective rejection
of solar interference, and allow tracking of a target by a missile in
flight without the need for a gimbaled sensor.    DESCRIPTION:  The US
Army employs semi-active laser optical sensors on many missile platforms
 to provide precision guidance to targets. The Army now places a strong
emphasis on low-cost missile seekers for use on relatively small missile
 platforms. The Army requires a novel, non-moving (strap-down) seeker
solution in order to reduce cost and complexity as well as enable use on
 small missile platforms. The Army has a need for a missile seeker
system which will not require the use of a moving mechanical structure,
such as a gimbal, to maintain track on a target. A strap-down missile
seeker must still evaluate the same wide field of regard as that which
may be covered by an equivalent gimbaled sensor. A semi-active laser
seeker must also operate in an environment which may be rich with
background radiance, such as when the sun may be located in the sensor
field of view.    Small invertebrates have eyes specifically tailored
for their tasks [1]. Many of those tasks include wide-field source
tracking in high-background environments. The Army therefore recognizes
the corollary that a biologically-inspired compound eye-type sensor may
provide a novel solution to the problem of a strap-down semi-active
laser seeker.    PHASE I:  Create a design for a novel compound eye
seeker and provide performance estimates, analyses, and simulations, to
include -but not limited to- resolution, optical throughput, and any
measures to predict rejection of solar or other radiation outside of a
selected near-infrared band-pass and angles of interest.     The novel
seeker optics shall be capable of detecting and tracking a target
illuminated by a selected laser operating in the near-infrared
(900nm-1100nm) wavelength region. The novel seeker optics shall enable
narrow band-pass filtering of the source to a 10nm (threshold), 2nm
(objective) transmission bandwidth, which shall be effective throughout
the entire field of regard of the seeker. The novel seeker design shall
allow tracking of the intended laser source throughout the sensor"s
field of regard when in the presence of a bright background source (i.e.
 the sun) located at any field point greater than 2 degrees (threshold),
 1 degree (objective) from the intended source.    The novel seeker
design shall allow implementation on a missile platform as small as 2.75
 inches and as large as 7 inches in diameter. The novel seeker shall
provide a field of view not less than 25 degrees. The Army will not
likely require a field of view greater than 50 degrees. The novel optic
shall optimize tracking accuracy and light collection ability while
simultaneously providing the previously-stated capabilities. A typical
detector sensor for this application is a quadrant detector less than
9.25mm in diameter. The Army shall prefer such a solution for ease of
implementation, but will consider other reasonable detector
configurations in the interest of cost to performance benefits.
Potential risks to achieving a low sensor cost with the proposed concept
 shall be identified in Phase I. Rough order of magnitude cost estimates
 on known components are encouraged in Phase I reporting in to reduce
risk earlier in the potential Phase II effort. The seeker design shall
identify any assumptions or requirements regarding sensor\/detector
configuration or any additional optics required for the operation of the
 seeker.    Phase I proposals will be technically evaluated on the
perceived ability of the technology to meet the previously-stated
desired system performance goals as well as achieve future cost goals.
  PHASE II:  Construct and deliver to the Army a prototype sensor system
 based upon the Phase I design which shall consist of a complete
assembly of the novel optical technology, sensor\/detector device,
electronics for sensor operation, and any hardware or software required
to obtain complete signal output from the sensor. The Army technical
point of contact shall provide any additional detailed requirements,
sensor recommendations, and detector module hardware as necessary,
pending a Phase II award.    Detailed design analysis and verification
thereof shall be performed as part of the Phase II effort. The army
shall use results from the analysis effort to run detailed performance
models and simulations. The awardee shall provide detailed cost
estimation for prototype and production-level quantities of the seeker.
   PHASE III:  Development of the optical technology described herein
will have immediate application to laser communications in both military
 and commercial sectors. The technology should find ready applications
in laboratory applications. Additional military spin-offs would include
missile warning sensors.",

for Thermal Batteries",

demands a substantial increase in potential and energy density over the
current state-of-the-art. The objective is to develop high potential and
 high capacity thermal batteries based on advanced electro-chemistry and
 engineering technologies pushing the boundaries of the current
state-of-the-art.    DESCRIPTION: Smaller size and longer mission
lifetime are among the critical changes being implemented in the next
generation missile systems.  The need to increase the range of smaller
missiles demands higher total energy in miniaturized thermal batteries
needed to power the guidance systems and other on-board electronics. The
 simultaneous fulfillment of higher energy and smaller footprint demands
 systems with significantly increased energy density.  Considering the
existing thermal batteries operating at lower potential, e.g., less than
 1.8V, the new thermal battery may need to operate at higher cell
potential and be stable at thermal battery operating conditions. Many
factors including material characteristics, mechanical perturbations,
thermal stabilities, and electrical issues also prevent the current
thermal batteries from reaching their optimum potential and specific
energy.      PHASE I: Conduct a feasibility electro-chemical and
engineering analysis of the optimization of potential and specific
energy.  Target cell level parameters should include at least 2.5 V of
the average operating voltage, and at least 1,000 Wh\/kg  of specific
energy.  Identify component materials\/engineering and provide merits of
 the proposed system.  Address the performance trade-offs and
compatibility issues among electrodes and the electrolytes. Design and
fabricate the first-generation thermal battery and perform cell testing
to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed materials and engineering
 approaches to provide a clear pathway for an advanced thermal battery
with optimized performance leading to the target goals.    PHASE II:
Design and fabricate a thermal battery to demonstrate the avarage cell
level operating voltage of&gt;2.5 V, and the cell level specific energy
of&gt;1,000 Wh\/kg with a current density not less than 0.5 A\/cm2.
All appropriate electro-chemical characteristics, engineering testing
and validation of the performance of the prototype system should be
performed. Provide all the cell components along with synthesis and
manufacturing processes. A working prototype should also be submitted to
 Army for evaluation.    PHASE III: Demonstrate improvements in
performance in non-operational and operational environments. Provide
complete engineering and test documentation for development of
manufacturing prototypes. A Phase III application for Army missile
systems could include battery miniaturization in legacy programs as well
 as incorporation into emerging programs. Programs that would benefit
from this technological innovation would include, but are not limited
to, the following programs: TOW, Excalibur, Stinger, Javelin, NLOS,
Griffin and JAGM. The development of other military applications of this
 technology may include future urban warfare
surveillance\/reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicles. This technology
is also applicable to sonabuoys which are large users of thermal
batteries. Among numerous civilian applications of this technology,
smaller emergency backup power sources for the aviation industry are
considered to be the most applicable.",

        "topic_name": "Fragmentation Data Collection and Analysis for
JMEMs Arena Tests",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative, low cost
approach to capture fragmentation mass, location, material type from a
Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM) arena characterization test.
  The objective is to reduce cost, man hours and turnaround time of
data.    DESCRIPTION: AMRDEC is interested in developing techniques to
improve the data collection and analysis associated with performing
ground-based static warhead arena characterization tests.  These tests
adhere to the guidelines and procedures described in the Joint Munitions
 Effectiveness Manual (JMEM).  The current method of characterizing
muntions is costly, labor intensive and produces an incomplete record of
 data.  For an arena test, a warhead is placed in the center of an arena
 consisting of blast-pressure gages and fragment collection media (often
 celotex bundles).  When initiated, the warhead fragments impinge
themselves into the celotex bundles for subsequent measurement and
analysis of their location, weight and shape.  Several days, if not
weeks of tedious and error-prone labor (~30hours\/bundle) are necessary
to locate, recover, weight and record the geometry of each fragment into
 a database; many of the smaller fragments are not even recovered.  At
an estimated $100\/hr - the cost of an arena test can balloon quite
substantially as the number of bundles and manhours to collect\/analyze
each bundle increase.      A typical fragment collection procedure is as
 follows:  1. Examine one bundle sheet at a time (typically a 2-foot
thick bundle contains 48 sheets [4'x8'x0.5"sheet])  2. Locate fragments
by hand and record location  3. Dig fragment out of celotex and place in
 a bag with fragment number for reference in database  4. Clean fragment
 with acetone and determine material type  5. Weigh fragment and record
 6. Compile all information into spreadsheet database for further
analysis    PHASE I: Develop an innovative, low cost concept to capture
fragmentation mass, location, material type using an automated method to
 detect and map fragment and provide fragment mass from a celotex
bundle.  This model should demonstrate modeling and simulation of the
ability to detect, track, derive position and mass, and record each
fragment embedded in a bundle.      The deliverable thresholds are:  1.
Material detection - Steel only  2. Location Coordinates - x, y, z
coordinates with +\/-0.5in  3. Mass - within 10% of fragment true weight
  4. Time - 15 hours per bundle    The deliverable objectives are:  1.
Material detection - Steel, Aluminum, Titanium  2. Location Coordinates -
 x, y, z coordinates within +\/-0.25in  3. Mass - within 5% of fragment
true weight  4. Time - 10 hours per bundle     During this phase, a
plan\/design for implementing this system into hardware will need to be
developed.    PHASE II: Following the development plan outlined in Phase
 I - design, develop, and implement a prototype fragmentation data
collection and analysis tool (hardware and software) during a JMEMs
arena test.     A deliverable from the Phase II will be the delivery of
an analysis system( hardware and software) to AMREDC and a successful
demonstration of the hardware and software of a JMEMs arena test meeting
 the minimum threshold requirements (preferably meeting the objectives)
with documented results.  Present a path forward to support JMEMs arena
testing with the implementation of the analysis tool and look at
potential commercialization areas.    PHASE III: Mature the system
developed in Phase II to a test-ready status.  The contractor will
pursue commercialization of the various technologies developed in Phase
II for potential commercial users in the areas of sensors and software
capable of high speed, high fidelity physical position and size
measurements and detection.  Once proven, this technology could be used
in a vast array of fields such as the medical field and mining
industry.",

        "topic_name": "Reproducible high yield production of structural
proteins for biologically-derived fibers as an alternative to nylon",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop (1) an industrially
compatible microbial expression system for high yield production of
structural proteins and (2) bio-derived fibers from stable protein
solutions through an aqueous-based, automated, scalable spinning
process.    DESCRIPTION: Nylon 6,6, a common chemically-derived polymer,
 is widely used in commercial and military applications that require a
high level of wear and tear. For the Army Combat Uniform (ACU) and
accompanying undergarments, blends of nylon and cotton are typically
generated to enhance comfort and improve moisture management, relative
to nylon being employed autonomously. However, certain aspects of
durability and mechanical integrity are decreased in the blended fabric.
 Moreover, the thermal decomposition of Nylon 6,6, independently or
within a blend, results in melt drip, which can cause secondary burns
during a flame or thermal event in combat. Biologically-derived fibers
have been identified as a viable alternative to nylon-based fibers, with
 mechanical integrity approaching nylon while being considered high
comfort materials. Furthermore, the biological nature of the materials
avoids melt drip injuries, as the fiber would not exhibit melt behavior
but rather complete thermal degradation. Additional benefits include (i)
 reduced weight, which addresses the ever evolving challenge of Soldier
load, (ii) reduced energy demands for fiber production, and (iii)
biodegradability, which addresses a growing trend of reduced signature
and footprint for contingency operations. Silkworm silk, the most common
 bio-fiber currently available for textile applications, is not viable
for use in U.S. Soldier textiles due to limitations on use of foreign
sourced materials. The Army must initiate efforts to investigate, create
 and develop domestic bio-derived textiles to keep pace with the next
generation of requirements, both environmental and performance related.
    This topic seeks to create a bio-derived alternative to nylon by
maturing the current state-of-the art relating to fibers derived from
structural proteins such as collagen (1), fibrin (2), spider silk (3)
and resolubilized hagfish slime (4). Structural proteins can
self-assemble into aligned polymer-like chains during fiber spinning,
akin to melt extrusion of chemically-derived polymers. The self-assembly
 process of structural proteins is tailorable, dependent upon the
solution matrix, and to some extent controllable, unlike other
bio-fibers such as jute and cellulose. Structural proteins therefore
represent an exciting opportunity to create bio-derived fibers that not
only could possess mechanical stability similar to that of nylon, but by
 manipulating the self-assembly process, could strive for properties of
high-performance polymeric fibers such as Kevlar. Furthermore, and in
contrast to natural fibers, structural protein-based fibers possess
surface functional groups that can serve as a platform for incorporating
 multifunctionality into bio-derived textiles, such as biorecognition
elements for pathogen sensing and antimicrobials for odor and skin
irritation control. While some advances have been made toward production
 of bio-derived fibers using structural proteins (e.g., spider silk
(5)), several technical hurdles persist. Protein production remains a
limiting factor for scaling of fiber production, and purification is a
key hurdle, as impurities limit fiber extensibility. Protein stability
and control of molecular chain alignment, before and during spinning,
are also major challenges for reproducible fiber formation.     The
specific goal of this topic is to develop innovative methods to produce
structural proteins in high yield and to reproducibly extrude these
proteins into biological fibers. The structural proteins should be
produced using a microbial host capable of generating kilogram
quantities of protein, and the purified protein monomers should be spun
into fibers using aqueous-based spinning techniques to reproducibly
generate fibers with properties equivalent to nylon. The processes and
products developed within this topic will serve as the basis for
commercialization of next generation, lightweight bio-derived fibers to
replace nylon in civilian and military textiles.    PHASE I: Develop
approaches to produce structural proteins in a scalable microbial host
and screen structural protein constructs for reproducible fiber
formation. Using methodology compatible with existing industrial
biotechnology infrastructure, demonstrate production of structural
protein at lab-scale quantities exceeding 10 grams of protein
(fermentation yield&gt;0.5 g\/L;&gt;50% purity). Assess the scalability
of both the microbial host production approach and the purification
process. Characterize protein conformation and self-assembly dynamics in
 solution. Develop an aqueous-based spinning approach to extrude fibers
from the purified protein solution, which is capable of scaling to
industrial production levels. Using the developed spinning approach,
screen structural protein constructs for fiber formation. Single fibers
must meet or exceed the following metrics: minimum 2-fold single draw,
pliable immediately after drying,&gt;40% of Nylon 6,6 mechanical
stability (tensile strength = 12-40 MPa; elastic modulus = 0.13-1.6
GPa).    PHASE II: Optimize the protein production and purification
approaches developed in Phase I and demonstrate production of structural
 protein constructs which achieved the required Phase I fiber metrics at
 pilot-scale quantities exceeding 2500 grams of protein (fermentation
yield&gt;2 g\/L;&gt;80% purity). Assess the scalability of the optimized
 pilot-scale expression system and purification process to
industrially-relevant levels. The structural protein solution produced
using the optimized pilot-scale system should exhibit no change in
turbidity over a period exceeding one month while stored in a diluted
state (i.e., non-spinnable concentration), no change in turbidity over a
 period of 2-4 days at concentrations suitable for fiber spinning, and
an ability to maintain protein conformation and self-assembly dynamics
in a concentrated state that are required for reproducible fiber
formation. Assess batch-to-batch reproducibility of protein solution

        "topic_name": "Ultra-low
power&amp;quot;system-on-a-chip&amp;quot;integrated circuit for
fieldable neurobiological sensing",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an ultra-low voltage system
for neurological sensing capable of operating with no secondary power
supply, with performance in the range of current commercially available
solutions. A successful application will include coordination with U.S.
Army Research Laboratory (ARL) scientists to ensure understanding of the
 application space of sensing brain activity within real-world
environments.    DESCRIPTION: Recent advances in neuroscience have made
great strides towards improving our understanding of how the nervous
system operates and our ability to monitor its function inaction.
Meanwhile, drastic improvements in sensor technology, as well as
streamlined system design, have led to more wearable
electroencephalography (EEG) solutions, which hold the promise of
performing true neurophysiologcal monitoring outside of the lab and in
more everyday or even potentially hazardous environments. For example,
use of dry (gel-free) electrodes greatly minimizes preparation time, and
 improved higher-bandwidth wireless technology has eliminated the need
for a physical tether between a wearer and the system, while also
reducing artifact noise.     Truly fieldable neurobiological sensing
systems would be revolutionary for on-line monitoring of Soldier
cognitive state in a wide range of environments, potentially integrated
as part of a standard helmet or patrol cap. However, all current
solutions for the electronics used within the central EEG data
acquisition (DAQ) systems pose fieldability challenges because of size,
weight, and power (SWAP) requirements. This is primarily due to the use
of conventional integrated circuit (IC) design and components, which are
 based on standard operation levels of millivolts to volts and high
power radios. As a result, they have an implicit requirement for
conventional power supplies (e.g. batteries) that add substantial weight
 to the total package. Conventional systems have, at most, 8-12 hours of
 battery life; this adds the burden of requiring continual interaction
and maintenance for the user. A system that is extremely small,
lightweight, able to operate for extremely long periods (hundreds of
hours to indefinitely), and requires virtually no interaction or direct
attention from the user (a"construct-and-forget"approach) would reduce
these barriers to fieldable systems integration and provide
ground-breaking capabilities across a broad range of environments and
application domains.     The intended goal of this proposal is to extend
 the operational time per use from hours to weeks, reduce the weight of
the system to a few grams, and decrease the size of the system to a
couple of square centimeters, through the development and refinement of a
 system-on-a-chip (SoC) DAQ system targeted for external
electrophysiological neurological applications (e.g. EEG), which
operates on ultra-low power requirements (microwatts). While some
previous work has demonstrated putative systems operating on ultra-low
power [1-5], none have been produced in a usable form-factor, or that
operate within a power realm low enough to be completely self-sustaining
 (operating in milliwatt or hundreds of microwatt range) while
containing the processing requirements necessary for EEG.     The Phase
II goal will be to completely eliminate the necessity for an external
power source through use of a local thermoelectric or other alternative
source. In order to suit the largest range of envisioned applications,
the final system would need to be capable of collecting high-resolution
data such as from a dense array (e.g. 64+ channels), high data precision
 (24+ bit), or high sample rate (1 kHz) with resulting SNR comparable to
 that of conventional EEG measurement systems. Additionally, it must be
capable of handling typical signal conditioning and pre-processing
procedures for EEG, data storage, and near-field (",

multifunctional sensor film",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop advanced flexible sensor
system with distributed sensing capability for measuring extreme
pressure\/force\/acceleration on Soldiers"heads and bodies caused by
ballistic, blast, and blunt impacts.    DESCRIPTION: Traumatic brain
injuries (TBI"s) caused by extreme events such as blast, ballistic, and
blunt impacts have produced a high incidence of casualties and long-term
 chronic consequences among U.S. troops fighting in Iraq and
Afghanistan. In order to augment medical understanding of the injury and
 to develop drastically improved personal protection, there is an urgent
 need for sensors capable of measuring such extreme pressure on human
bodies. The US Army has recently developed a single-point helmet sensor
to collect data of hits from explosions and other blunt impacts [1],
which, however, is unable to measure the pressure distribution on the
entire head. To fully understand the pressure distribution on the entire
 head upon blast\/ballistic\/blunt impact, and to evaluate the
effectiveness of protective helmet, measurement of multi-point 3D
pressure distribution is needed.     Such advanced sensors are also
needed for helmet and body armor testing. The current testing standards
measure the maximum deformation of clay behind a helmet or a body armor
plate during ballistic impact tests and uses this back face signature as
 a predictor of behind armor blunt trauma injury [2-4]. However, the
clay deformation and blunt trauma injury have not been well correlated
and understood. A direct measurement of multipoint dynamic pressure
behind helmets and armor plates is extremely important to establish
biomechanical-based behind-armor\/helmet blunt trauma criteria for
protective equipment.     The current commercial off-the-shelf sensors
have not been able to meet the stringent demands posed by the high
impact events. It is the objective of this SBIR program to develop an
advanced flexible, high-frequency, high-durability and multifunctional
lightweight film type sensor array system, which has (1) a capacity to
measure extremely high pressure of 350 MPa (50 ksi) caused by multiple
blasts, ballistic and blunt impacts, (2) an extremely fast time response
 (1 micro-second or less), (3) a large deformation capacity up to 5.08
cm (2 inches), (4) ability to record multi-point pressure profiles over a
 spatial resolution of 0.6 cm (0.25 inch) or less with a scalable total
surface area of coverage up to 2 square meters, and (5) a wearable
electronic system including data acquisition, storage, and power with a
total volume no larger than 50 cubic centimeters with a fast sampling
rate (at least 1MHz) to record the pressure history and the location of
the blast\/impact events. The system should able to function for at
least 48 hours on a single charge. Equally important, the sensor must be
 soft, flexible, thin, lightweight, and friendly to human bodies.
PHASE I: The Phase I proposal should focus on pressure\/force film
sensors, including a detailed description of technical approaches to
achieving the pressure\/force, time response, and deformation
requirements. The Phase I study shall develop a preliminary design of
the proposed pressure\/force film sensor array and a sensor calibration
method. Ballistic and blunt impact tests shall be carried out to
demonstrate the feasibility of the sensor to measure the
behind-helmet\/soft armor impact associated with a large deformation
over a total area of at least 230 square centimeters (36 square inches).
 System design should demonstrate potential to meet performance metrics
as enumerated in the topic description.     PHASE II: Using the results
from Phase I, the Phase II effort shall develop a prototype wearable
sensor array system having multi-point distributed pressure\/force
sensing capability and incorporated with MEMs accelerometers. The
prototype shall have micro data acquisition, communication, and power
modules. The prototype shall be integrated in the U.S. Army"s advanced
combat helmets and soft armor and evaluated through ballistic, blast,
and blunt impact tests. Required testing includes but is not limited to
selected helmet and soft body armor systems. To facilitate sensor system
 development and integration into Army research initiatives, one (1) to
four (4) developmental sensor systems should be supplied to the Army for
 conducting further testing during the Phase II process. System
performance must be demonstrated to meet or exceed specific metrics as
enumerated in the topic description.     PHASE III: In addition to
military applications, the developed sensors can be applied to many
other civilian applications such as crashworthiness in vehicle designs,
blast resistance in commercial aircraft, weather and blast resistance in
 civil structures, sporting equipment, and law enforcement protective
gear. Phase III should include establishment of a manufacturing
infrastructure, either through an industrial partnership or development
of in-house capabilities.  The manufacturing capability should include
sufficient volume and facilities to establish a fully commercialized
sensor product and support a potential operational capability.",

        "topic_name": "Low-profile antennas using
anisotropic\/inhomogeneous magneto-dielectric metamaterials",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop low-profile Very-High
Frequency\/Ultra-High Frequency (VHF\/UHF) antenna apertures using
choice materials such as anisotropic\/inhomogeneous magneto-dielectrics.
    DESCRIPTION: The advent of metamaterials has extended the design
space for antenna apertures [4, p.4, (2.20)] creating the possibility
for very thin (relative to wavelength) antenna structures. While basic
physics limits directivity [4, p.10, (2.107)] to the available aperture
size, such restrictions do not preclude antennas of reasonable
directivity having thicknesses that are fractions of wavelengths.
Properly designed antennas may exhibit bandwidths of an octave or more
from the standpoint of the realized gain [4, p.29, (2.321)] keeping the
realized gain greater than 0 dBi over one or more octaves.
Specifically, the intent of this solicitation is to model and create
low-profile antennas. These antennas should have a thickness that does
not exceed 1\/30th of the wavelength in free space for the lowest
operating frequency of the antenna and the antenna should maintain a
realized gain greater than 0 dBi over one or more octaves. The antenna
should be realized using use magneto-dielectric layer(s) having
anisotropic \/inhomogeneous constitutive parameters. It is presumed, but
 not required, that the anisotropic \/inhomogeneous (effective)
constitutive parameters are achieved through the use of metamaterials.
The antenna should be operational in the VHF\/UHF range. Any solution
that achieves these antenna goals is desired.     The use of high
relative permeability and permittivity materials sandwiched between the
radiating element (e.g., a dipole, bow tie, Archimedean spiral, etc.)
and an electric ground plane allows the radiating element to be in close
 proximity to a ground plane while maintaining reasonable input
impedance for matching purposes [1]. A fundamental problem with such
geometry is the excitation of lateral (surface waves) [3, p. 736] that
may guide a significant percentage of the power to the edges of the
antenna before scattering into space. Presuming the antenna structure is
 contained in some type of enclosure (often metallic), these lateral
waves may contribute to unwanted internal resonances having a
deleterious effect on both the impedance match and the antenna"s
radiation pattern. Accordingly, the antenna may not perform as needed
from the standpoint of efficiency or the stability of the radiation
pattern broadside to the antenna.     A possible solution to the
aforementioned problem would employ a magneto-dielectric layer having
anisotropic \/inhomogeneous constitutive parameters. Properly tailored,
such a layer could enhance a frequency independent antenna design while
mitigating (or exploiting) the lateral wave excitations. A
magneto-dielectric layer created of anisotropic metamaterials (having
graded unit cell parameters) is one possible realization of such
geometry. In general, the layer may have constitutive parameters that
are anisotropic as well as inhomogeneous for both the permittivity and
permeability. As frequency independent antennas inherently use the
entire element at the lowest frequency while using less of the element
as the frequency increases, the gain and input impedance remain
reasonably constant [2, p. 611]. The anisotropic\/inhomogeneous
prescription for the metamaterial magneto-dielectric should be developed
 in such a way as to keep the efficiency of the antenna as high as
possible while maintain a good impedance match over an octave (or more)
frequency band. Clearly, the"antenna"must be considered to be the entire
 structure consisting of the ground plane, magneto-dielectric, and the
excitation element.     The realization of the anisotropic
\/inhomogeneous magneto-dielectric layer is further complicated by the
inherent problems associated with the ferromagnetic resonance of the
magnetic material and the associated magnetic loss tangent. Practical
realizations of an antenna are likely to be limited to frequencies under
 1 GHz.     PHASE I: Demonstrate through computer simulations and\/or
analysis the viability of using a choice material, such as
anisotropic\/inhomogeneous magneto-dielectrics, to enhance absolute
antenna gain. Such an analysis, over an octave bandwidth, should
demonstrate stability of the input impedance (",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop and demonstrate
a"novel"direct fuel injection system for small unmanned
compression-ignition heavy-fuel (primarily Jet Propellant-8) engines
(3-70 horsepower)    DESCRIPTION: The Army is in need of efficient
heavy-fuel small engines (3 to 70 horsepower) for unmanned aerial and
ground systems. The success of these engines requires efficient and
reliable micro direct fuel injection systems. Currently, there is no
reliable direct fuel injection system for small engines due to various
reasons. One of them is manufacturing capability of micro nozzles.
Use of direct fuel injection into a combustion chamber can achieve much
higher engine efficiency than that of carburetor or port fuel injection.
 Direct fuel injection also provides flexibility to control combustion
processes to improve engine performance and efficiency by using
injection strategies such as multiple injections and rate shaping which
shall be compared with the current Shadow Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
engine (i.e. a 38-horsepower rotary engine with aviation gasoline).
Since much higher fuel injection pressure can be applied for direct fuel
 injection, engine power can be increased significantly higher than the
old fuel injection systems. Direct fuel injection system has been
predominantly developed for low- to heavy-duty engines. Therefore, while
 the demand for the small engines is increasing, there has been no
reliable direct fuel injection system for small engines. Furthermore, in
 contrast to low- to heavy-duty engine classes for which significant
amounts of research have been done by large companies, no noticeable
research on small engines have been done until now. One of the main
challenges in developing a direct fuel injection system for small
engines is preparing combustible fuel-air mixture within the confined
space of the small engine combustion chamber. The current off-the-shelf

        "topic_name": "Universal Software-Defined Receiver for Assured
and Seamless Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to develop a
software-defined navigation receiver with an improved assurance level
for position, navigation, and timing (PNT). To mitigate the jamming,
interference, and spoofing vulnerability of the Global Positioning
System (GPS) receiver, the receiver gathers signals from GPS as well as
other emerging global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs). Furthermore,
 the receiver can use opportunistic non-GNSS signals to extract useful
information to assist the GNSS signals in order to improve PNT
assurance.    DESCRIPTION: Current Army operations rely heavily on
Global Positioning System (GPS) signals to provide position, navigation,
 and timing (PNT) information. Most current navigation receivers rely on
 GPS signals only and are vulnerable to jamming, interference, and
spoofing. GPS signal gaps often exist in urban and indoor environments,
where the signals are susceptible to line-of-sight blockage and
multi-path reflection.     With the modernization of GPS satellites and
the emergence of other global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs),
including Galileo, GLONASS, and COMPASS, many more new GNSS signals
other than the widely used GPS L1 signal is available. PNT information
can also be extracted from signals of opportunity. These signals of
opportunity include both satellite and terrestrial signals, such as Long
 Range Navigation (LORAN), cellular code division multiple access
(CDMA), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), 4G Long Term
Evolution (LTE), broadcast TV\/Radio, Iridium, and much more. Dedicated
pseudolites can also be set up to broadcast PNT information. These
signals of opportunity can be combined with GNSS signals to increase the
 availability and assurance of PNT information, and create seamless
situational awareness for Soldiers in combat. For example, it has been
demonstrated that precision timing can be extracted from cellular CDMA
signals and used to improve the coherent integration time of a GPS
receiver to recover weak GPS signals in an indoor environment.
Although GNSS receiver technology has matured significantly over the
past 20 year, most receivers can only acquire signals at one or two GPS
frequencies. Multi-GNSS, multi-frequency receivers are at the early
stage of development as new GNSS signals are being broadcasted. Ways to
develop techniques and algorithms to recover PNT or PNT-related
information from the signals of opportunity mentioned above to assist
and complement GNSS receivers in GNSS-denied and weak signal
environments are being actively pursued by many researchers. However,
computationally efficient implementations of these signal fusion
techniques to improve PNT assurance and create devices that are suitable
 for portable use and have a low power form factor still require
significant development.     The goal of this program is to develop a
reprogrammable, software-defined, multi-GNSS, multi-frequency receiver
with signals of opportunity fusion. The receiver will leverage recent
developments in high-speed analog-to-digital converters and
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for signal capturing, digitizing,
 and processing. An efficient digital signal processing algorithm will
be developed to integrate multi-GNSS signals and signals of opportunity.
 A broadband radio frequency (RF) front end that can cover the ~500-MHz
band occupied by GNSS signals at L-band as well as other frequencies
used by signals of opportunity will also be developed as part of the
receiver.    PHASE I: In Phase I, the proposer will analyze and select a
 suitable receiver architecture for receiving, capturing, and analyzing
multiple GNSS signals at multiple frequencies as well as a select number
 of signals of opportunity. The receiver must cover GPS, Galileo,
GLONASS, and COMPASS signals. The analysis must show integration of at
least three signals of opportunity and demonstrate a path to incorporate
 more signals if necessary. The receiver can be implemented using a
wideband direct digital RF front end or a channelized RF front end. In
order to integrate signals of opportunity, an alternative architecture
using a wideband RF channel for GNSS signals and a number of narrowband
RF channels for signals of opportunity is permissible.  The proposer
will analyze the trade-off between the speed and vertical resolution
requirements of the analog-to-digital converters and the digitized
signal distortion. The proposer will investigate digital signal
processing algorithms to process and track multiple GNSS signals. The
tracking can be performed using Kalman filters as well as other
innovative approaches. The tracking must be able to incorporate signals
of opportunity. Performance metrics, such as receiver sensitivity,
interference rejection, etc., will be defined in the study to quantify
the improvement in PNT assurance level. The proposer will analyze the
implementation of the signal processing algorithms in FPGAs and
determine the computational resource requirements. The overall power
consumption and performance of the receiver will be analyzed and
compared to current state-of-the-art GPS receivers.     PHASE II: In
Phase II, the proposer will demonstrate a prototype of a multi-GNSS
receiver with signals of opportunity fusion by implementing the receiver
 architecture and signal processing algorithm developed in Phase I. The
receiver must be a complete receiver including a broadband antenna, an
RF front end, digitizers, and a signal processing unit. A single
broadband antenna must be used to cover all signals of interest. The
signal processing unit must be implemented in an FPGA for
programmability. Either evaluation boards or a dedicated developmental
system can be used for the implementation. The proposer will perform a
field demonstration of the prototype against state-of-the-art GPS
receivers under adverse environments such as weak signal (indoor),
intentional jamming, etc., using metrics developed in Phase I. The
proposer will demonstrate the programmability of the receiver by using
different numbers of GNSS signals and signals of opportunity.
Programmability should also be demonstrated using the new and updated
signal processing algorithm.     PHASE III: In Phase III, the proposer
will develop a portable version of the multi-GNSS receiver with signals
of opportunity fusion. The receiver should be implemented in an
application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) form factor to lower the
size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C). Initially, the SWAP-C of the
multi-signal receiver could be worse than that of a state-of-the-art,
single-signal GPS receiver because of the increase in functionality. At
the commercialization stage of the program, the SWAP-C of the
multi-signal receiver should be comparable to that of a
state-of-the-art, single-signal GPS. Also, a military version of the
multi-signal receiver capable of receiving, processing, and integrating
military GNSS signals (for example, GPS L2 M code) will be developed for
 transition to PD PNT.",

communication",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop a plug-and-play nonlinear
device based on periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide (or
similar) having high difference, and sum, conversion efficiency with at
least 10 dB signal-to-noise.    DESCRIPTION: The Department of Defense
and the Army has a vested interest in secure communications. Quantum
communication has been shown to be secure against eavesdropping due to
the nature of entanglement. Potential next generation quantum
communication systems include transmission of quantum information
entangled with quantum memories. Quantum memories allow for extended
distance quantum key distribution (QKD) and for storage and later
retrieval of quantum information in a network composed of many nodes.
In these cases, frequency conversion of single photons is needed. Such
quantum frequency conversion has been demonstrated for certain
wavelengths with periodically poled lithium niobate (and similar
periodically poled ferroelectric waveguides). The objective here is to
develop a complete package that supports quantum frequency conversion
between the specified wavelengths.  This quantum frequency conversion
package would allow for long-haul quantum communication because the
output\/input is a photon in the telecommunications band. Successful
demonstration of the packaged outlined below will directly and
significantly impact quantum communication, long-haul quantum
communication, and hybrid quantum technologies.       Periodically poled
 lithium niobate (PPLN), a ferroelectric crystal, is a versatile
nonlinear medium. It is well established as a material of choice for
optical amplifiers, second harmonic generation and nonlinear waveguides.
 For efficient use of PPLN in frequency conversion, a waveguide is often
 fabricated into the PPLN. Obtaining efficient input coupling of two
nondegenerate optical frequencies into a PPLN waveguide is challenging.
Moreover, obtaining an efficient waveguide for both the nondegenerate
frequencies in order to achieve high efficiency frequency conversion is
another difficulty.      This call is for two devices, one capable of
difference frequency generation (DFG) and a second capable of sum
frequency generation (SFG). The aim of this program is to design,

Materials with Superior Properties",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate the application of
electromagnetic fields to develop, manipulate, process, and produce
ultralightweight metals with superior properties.    DESCRIPTION: The
Army is highly interested in the application of electromagnetic fields
for development of ultralightweight metals with tailored microstructures
 and properties.  The current methods used to manipulate metal
properties involve varying scale, composition, temperature, and pressure
 to improve strength, hardness, facture toughness, elastic modulus,
density, etc., but the use of these traditional techniques for tailoring
 a wide range of chemical and physical properties is reaching a plateau.
  It is worth noting that significant ongoing research is being
dedicated to re-engineering and exploring the creation of materials at
the nanoscale, which holds potential for future applications that
inherently hinge on surmounting scalability, assembly, and producibility
 challenges.  However, there is an emerging technology that goes beyond
factors of scale, composition, temperature, and pressure, and holds
great promise in facilitating the realization of transformal materials
with the aid of externally applied fields.  The application of fields
may alter phase transformation pathways, create new microstructures,
shift equilibrium favoring new metastable alloys, align phases,
manipulate and shape nanoscale architectures, and produce materials with
 revolutionary structural and multifunctional properties otherwise
unattainable by conventional processing and production methods.   The
application of electromagnetic fields offers the unique opportunity to
direct the architecture of materials features across atomic, molecular,
micro, meso, and continuum levels.  These fields may either be used to
induce a permanent material property improvement or to selectively
activate enhanced time-dependent properties via dynamic stimulation.
Relatively low energy field-assisted processing methods such as spark
plasma sintering (SPS), microwave sintering, and flash sintering have
been developed to introduce electric and microwave fields for reduction
of sintering temperatures and times [1-3]. Ultrahigh electric and
magnetic fields have been applied during material consolidation to
enhance material properties and alter conventional phase diagrams,
pushing the limits of traditional materials science [4]. However, the
fundamental thermodynamics and reaction kinetics that result in improved
 processing and revolutionary changes in properties are not well
understood.  Research on materials subjected to ultrahigh magnetic
fields has been conducted at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory
 (NHMFL) [5-6]. As an example, work by Oak Ridge National Laboratory
(Ludtka et al) at the NHMFL has led to prediction of modified phase
diagrams for a number of metals, including bainitic steel under a 30T
applied magnetic field [4].    While several field-assisted methods have
 recently emerged, the goal of this effort is the development of new
technologies that combine, augment, or control metal properties with
electromagnetic fields and concurrently drive dynamical processes within
 assembly and production. The overarching technical challenges are to
(1) develop a fundamental understanding of the chemical, physical,
structural, and engineering aspects of field augmentation of metals, (2)
 identify phenomena that enable control of applied field manipulation of
 metals (3) develop concepts and approaches demonstrating enhancement to
 strength, hardness, facture toughness, elastic modulus, etc., (4)
perform numerical modeling to describe and predict electromagnetic field
 influence on properties, (5) elucidate approaches that enable field
control for scale-up of metals production, and (6) develop an agile
manufacturing design for in-house fabrication and commercial licensing.
   PHASE I: Perform research and analysis that will allow for the
demonstration of new concepts to apply electromagnetic fields (electric,
 magnetic, microwave, etc.) for the development of high specific
strength metals with tailored microstructures and properties. Concepts
should demonstrate a significant enhancement in strength, hardness,
fracture toughness, elastic properties, etc., for metals and metal
alloys (e.g. magnesium, aluminum, etc.). Concept evaluation will include
 fabrication of coupons that demonstrate significant property
improvements when compared to current state-of-the-art metals via
comprehensive characterization techniques (microscopy, property testing,
 nondestructive evaluation, etc.). Explore the incorporation of derived
principles and theories into modeling and simulation tools with design
predictive capabilities.    PHASE II: Demonstrate an approach that
enables field control for scale-up of metals production through the
development of a novel process and a functional system for applying
electromagnetic fields.  Design and construct the necessary equipment
and devices for accurately and reproducibly applying electromagnetic
fields to fabricate metals with improved properties.  Continued
investigation and insight into the physics of the interactions between
the applied fields and metals is also required as it relates to
scale-up.  Development of appropriate process models is necessary and
required.  In-situ characterization capabilities including process
control and feedback are desired but not required.    PHASE III: Develop
 an agile manufacturing system for in-house fabrication and commercial
licensing by assembling commercial equipment suitable for applying
electromagnetic fields of interest to a range of metals during
processing under necessary temperature and pressure conditions.  This
system will include in-situ characterization capabilities and process
control for quantitatively analyzing the effects of electromagnetic
fields in real-time (microscopy, x-ray diffraction, nondestructive
evaluation, etc.).  Demonstration of this innovative system for
fabricating metals with tailored and enhanced properties will assist the
 proposer in commercialization of the process or metals developed under
this effort.  Anticipated commercial applications may include novel
advanced metals, electromagnetic equipment and devices, and modeling
tools that accurately simulate the effects of applied electromagnetic
fields on materials processing.  The potential advantages of developing
these applications include energy savings, property control and
tailoring, and small volume production, which are equally valuable to
both commercial and defense manufacture.  Virtually all metals and some
other materials industries, even commodity industries, as well as
commercial and defense aerospace, automotive, and ship industries could
benefit.",

        "topic_name": "Abuse Tolerant High Energy LiCoPO4-Based 5V
Li-ion Cells",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this topic is to
produce abuse tolerant, full LiCoPO4 based Li-ion cells of size greater
than or equal to 1 Ah.     DESCRIPTION: Li-ion batteries provide the
most energy storage capability on a weight and volume basis and high
energy dense batteries are needed to reduce the weight borne by the
soldier. However, Li-ion batteries have been shown to be susceptible to
abuse which may lead to fires and explosions as recently shown by highly
 publicized airplane groundings. There is thus a need for high energy
batteries which are tolerant to abuse conditions. LiFePO4 is a
well-known battery material which is known to be safe owing to the
nature of the bonding of the oxygen atoms - the covalent nature binds
the oxygen whereas higher energy oxide cathode materials such as LiCoO2
may tend to lose oxygen and accelerate fires and explosions [1]. The
tradeoff is the lower energy content of LiFePO4 which is a 3.4 V system
where the energy of the cell is a product of voltage times the capacity.
 LiCoPO4 is a cathode material which has the same chemical structure as
that of LiFePO4 but a much higher voltage of 4.8 V thereby offering the
possibility to have a high energy battery (40% more than LiFePO4) which
is tolerant to abuse conditions [2]. It has not yet been commercialized
owing to restrictions on the voltage limits of the electrolytes and
owing to capacity fade issues with the electrolyte. However, recent
developments of high voltage electrolytes [3] and the invention of a
substituted form of LiCoPO4 [2] have led to the possibility to
commercialize this cathode material. This solicitation aims to build
upon these new developments to build abuse tolerant Li-ion cells and
demonstrate this tolerance through standard testing. A successful
program will smooth the path towards commercialization.    PHASE I: Full
 Li-ion cells of size greater than 1 Ah will be produced using LiCoPO4
(or substituted LiCoPO4) as cathode and standard commercial graphite as
the anode. Abuse tolerance results will be obtained, where abuse
tolerance minimally includes overcharging and short circuit. Desirable
additional testing includes crush, nail penetration and high temperature
 exposure. The overcharging test uses an excessive current rate and
charging time to determine whether a sample cell can withstand an
overcharge condition without an explosion or fire. The short circuit
test directly connects the positive and negative terminals of the cell
to find the cell"s tolerance to a maximum current without explosion or
fire. The heating test measures a cell"s ability to withstand an
elevated temperature for a period of time. The tests shall follow
standard lithium battery testing protocols such as UL (Underwriter"s
Laboratory) 1642, (dated 25 November 2009). Since this testing is highly
 dependent on cell format and the nature of the counter electrode it is
imperative that control cells with the same counter electrode and cell
format are used. The preferred control cell chemistry is a LiCoO2
cathode with a graphite anode. Ideally, the same electrolyte for test
and control cells would be used though a small amount of high voltage
stabilizing additives (",

        "topic_name": "Color Matching High Durability Coating for Combat
 Vehicle Tires and Treads",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Combat vehicle tire\/tracks represent
 a significant percentage of the vehicle"s signature. The objective is
to develop a high durability coating to provide long term color matching
 for combat ground vehicle tires and track treads that matches the body
color of the combat vehicle. The developed technology will improve the
signature of combat vehicle by increasing the percentage of the vehicle
addressed by camouflage coatings.     DESCRIPTION: Currently, combat
vehicles benefit from highly specialized paint coatings which provide
significant reductions in detection by matching the vehicle"s color with
 the spectrum of their surroundings. This ability is the basis of
camouflage. A significant amount of ground combat vehicles front and
side image profile consists of tires and tracks. Currently, these tires
and tracks are black in color due to the materials in which they are
constructed (MIL-DTL-3100H). This means that a significant portion of a
vehicle is left unaided by camouflage and is often in high contrast to
the vehicle and environment. As a result, vehicles can be identified and
 targeted more easily and at greater distances. The goal is to develop a
 durable coating method to reduce the contrast between the vehicle body
and their tires and tracks. Ideally this will improve the overall
visible signature reduction of the vehicle. This includes all surface
areas of tires and treads track pads (side walls, tread grooves and
tread surface).     A coating method is being sought to provide this
color matching capability. Current mil specification colors include
those defined in MIL-DTL-53039D. The Army"s primary camouflage colors
are Aircraft Gray, 36300, Aircraft Green, 34031, Black, 37030, Brown
383, 30051, Green 383, 34094, Green 808, IRR Foliage Green 504,
34160,Tan 686A, 33446 and Woodland Desert Sage, 34201. Of these colors,
the color of immediate interest for tire coloration is Tan 686A. The
coating should have a flat or lusterless finish as described in
MIL-DTL-53072 as tested by ASTM D523 - Standard Test Method for Specular
 Gloss. (Department of Defense adopted).     Of particular importance is
 the durability of the coating material. It should be able to remain
true in color and finish for the duration of the application lifetime.
The material should be suitable for driving conditions on both paved and
 off road terrain. The coating should be designed to survive the high
pressures and shear characteristics of rapid acceleration and stopping
encountered with military combat vehicles. The coating needs to retain
its conformity to the tire and track elastomeric material. The thickness
 of the coating should not interfere with the performance of the
vehicle. It should also not attract more contamination than the baseline
 tire, tread material.     The coating must tolerate environmental
durability issues such as vehicle heat, UV and weather. Coating
materials should not contain heavy metals or other known hazardous
materials (MIL-DTL-53072D).     The color coating method should not
damage or reduce the lifetime of the tires, treads, tracks, underbody
coatings or vehicle paint. The color match coating method should require
 the same level of cleaning effort as with the original tire, track
tread. Minimal masking off of tires from the rest of the vehicle during
the coating process is preferred. Application with the tires and tracks
on the vehicle is desirable.     PHASE I: Demonstrate a durable coating
which will allow color matching of tires and track vehicle treads. This
coating will be in mil spec colors with gloss levels to match current
Army MIL-DTL-53072 requirements. For phase I, the durable tire coating
will match color and gloss of Tan 686A.     Materials developed during
Phase I shall be evaluated on appropriate substrates to demonstrate
their wear and adhesion performance to simulate application on a vehicle
 tire\/ track tread. This data along with samples of the material
applied to an appropriate substrate will be provided for comparison to
Tan 686A.   A cure schedule will also be provided that describes the
time for each step required to apply the coating. This will include the
time required to reach sufficient cure to handle a tire as well as the
time needed to reach a full cure sufficient to drive a vehicle without
damaging the coating.     PHASE II: Demonstrate the ability to produce
the coating system in primary camouflage colors brown 383, green 383,
green 808, IRR foliage green 504, tan 686A, and woodland desert sage
34201. Phase II will include best efforts to match mil spec colors in
the visible (400-700 nanometers) and near infrared (700-900 nanometers).
     Phase II will include the demonstration of a prototype application
station. The station will be portable and designed to be placed inside
of a military vehicle style paint spray booth or portable painting
structure if necessary. It should not require any additional safety or
waste management requirements beyond those for applying CARC paint
MIL-DTL-53072D.     A field repair kit will be developed that uses hand
held equipment that can be shipped by air to combat locations. Kits will
 be available in all primary camouflage colors with similar performance
to the original coating. Each kit will be sufficient to completely color
 treat a surface area of 4 feet x 4 feet.   Successful deliverable will
be judged upon evaluation of the prototype application station"s ability
 to apply the coating to tires and track treads to combat vehicles. The
coatings will be evaluated by the government for color accuracy, and
coating permanence after being driven on the vehicles for a period of 6
months under various conditions.     PHASE III: Phase III will provide
the military a commercialized version of the color coating system. The
technology will be incorporated into the CARC coating acquisition. Phase
 III coatings would seek to improve overall durability and lifetime of
the tire by protecting it from environmental damage (dry-rot, ultra
violet light damage). The coating would be applied to all combat vehicle
 tires and track treads when they receive their initial camouflage
coating in paint spray booths. Commercial touch up kits will also be
manufactured to allow in field touch-up and in field modifications
typically needed under special force missions.     This technology would
 be applicable to produce a durable commercial coating to improve the
lifetime of off road sport utility, emergency response, recreational and
 construction vehicle tires and track treads which are susceptible to UV
 and ground level ozone (dry-rot).     For general public safety this
technology can provide cars and trucks with a means allow coloring of
black-wall tires to improve visibility of vehicle against asphalt
roadways. .   The coating technology could also be applied to
elastomeric inflated structures to provide a long lasting color and
environmental protection. Such structures are used by both Department of
 Defense and the civilian market. Additionally, this technology could
also be used to color rubberized inflatable boats for military and
commercial purposes.",

        "topic_name": "Experimental Application of Non-Relational
Database Technology for Scaled Simulation Based Training",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to research and
develop a non-relational database (NRB) approach for use with existing
simulation based training applications. NRB strategies allow for
horizontal scaling of computational resources (ie taking advantage of
more nodes in a computational cluster of computers) that traditional
structured query language databases do not. The resulting approach is
expected to increase efficiencies in the way the SBT application
operates.    DESCRIPTION: The background rationale for scaling the
simulation based trainers is to address the issue of properly
representing the operational environment for Army training needs. The
majority of current simulation based virtual environment training
applications are only used to train at the small unit level, 40 soldiers
 or less. The reason for this is the inability for current systems to
handle larger numbers of concurrent users in the same place at the same
time. This also means there are limited system resources left over for
opposing forces and neutral entities. It is believed that virtual world
technology may be used to achieve the goal of full spectrum operations
during virtual mission rehearsal exercises.     Traditional structured
query language databases follow a"one-size-fits-all"approach to data
storage and retrieval. High performance applications can be tuned for
efficiency using non-relational approaches to database design.
Algorithmic research is required to apply non-relational database
techniques to virtual environment based trainers, therefore allowing for
 an increased amount of simultaneous training participants and\/or
increased level of complexity in the virtual training environment. After
 the analysis of the simulation based training prototype is complete and
 the non-relational database is constructed for it, a generalized
version of that database and the analysis approach can then be used and
applied to other simulation based training applications. The impact of
this SBIR technology directly affects the virtual training application"s
 ability to scale the number of participants and the ability to increase
 complexity of the scenes.     Non-relational database approaches have
not yet been widely adopted by simulation based training architectures.
Non-relational database architectures are still in their infancy
compared to traditional database approaches. Early experimentation in
academia shows great promise for efficiency gains with their proper
employment. The commercial game engines that virtual training systems
are based on have different data requirements as they are proprietary
and do not share a common code base. The non-relational databases rely
on specific tuning for each application making the prospect of a
migration to a non-relational database risky for them. A generalized
approach that shows significant increases in performance and efficiency
would be extremely attractive to industry. Possible areas of
optimization include scene graph management and object sorting. When
dealing with extremely large data sets or many simultaneous uses, both
of these applications would benefit from increases in efficiency and
translate to increased performance.     Scalability can be examined in
three different categories: size of operational area, number of entities
 in the environment, and the complexity of the environment. The next
generation of training applications need to handle more human users,
more complex objects such as vehicles and non-player characters and
larger operational areas to create realistic scenarios in new
operational environments. The application of next generation database
technology to existing prototypes will help achieve increases in
scalability.     PHASE I: The offeror will be provided with a prototype
virtual training environment currently in use by the US ARL\/STTC. The
offeror will analyze and provide conceptual designs for alternative
database deployment for the virtual environment provided to them by the
US ARL\/STTC. The alternate database designs will include non-relational
 distributed clusters intended to maximize scalability and availability
for use with large quantities of data. The offeror will provide
estimates of differences in performance. This effort will determine the
feasibility of applying the non-relational distributed model to the
problem of database scalability.    PHASE II: The offeror will conduct a
 comparative study of the latest research in non-relational distributed
databases with the current relational database deployments. The offeror
will design performance tests which are representative of real-world
usage and report the results of the testing. The offerer will develop,
test, and demonstrate an implementation of the highest performing
database approach in a relevant Army training environment, such as the
ARL Simulation and Training Technology Center (STTC) Military Open
Simulator Enterprise Strategy (MOSES) effort and the Training and
Doctrine Command"s (TRADOC) Enhanced Dynamic GeoSocial Environment
(EDGE) effort. Although the approach may be demonstrated in a specific
environment (e.g., MOSES)t, the design will not be tied to this
environment. The outcome of this research is to provide designs and
guidance for current simulation based training environments to inspect
for possible migration to a next generation non-relational distributed
database. Phase II deliverables will include a comparative study of the
various non-relational database designs, test results, a working
prototype of the highest performing implementation.     PHASE III: The
offeror will work to apply this approach for large scale (mission
command to boots on the virtual ground) operations during mission
rehearsal exercises. A simulated mission rehearsal training exercise
will support thousands of human users simultaneously with an accurately
represented operational area. Beyond US Army use, the offeror will also
work to commercialize the results of the application research and
resulting algorithms as a solution in the entertainment industry to
provide more realistic gaming experiences, with higher fidelity and
larger numbers of simultaneous players.",

        "topic_name": "Interference Cancellation for Mobile Force
Protection Jamming",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate an approach for canceling
 cosite interference on dismounted soldiers as a result of collocated
communications and an electronic warfare (EW) system without a physical
connection between the EW and communications system.       DESCRIPTION:
Dismounted soldiers carry various Command, Control, Communications,
Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR)
equipment associated with various mission profiles.  The Army continues
to strive to bring more information and extend the tactical network all
the way down to the individual rifleman.  This requires dismounted
soldiers to carry various wireless communications equipment which is
spectrum dependent.   In addition to communicating over the Network,
some missions necessitate the need for soldiers to carry electronic
warfare (EW) for force protection.  Soldiers carrying both radios and EW
 systems become at risk for electromagnetic fratricide between the
systems.  This can lead to degraded communications and the inability to
deliver timely situational awareness and mission command in a friendly
force EW environment.        Solving this issue for dismounted soldiers
introduces unique challenges as the size, weight, and power (SWaP)
associated with equipment must be conducive to dismounted soldier
operations.  Adding additional cabling between the EW and communications
 systems introduces additional weight, snag hazards, and mobility
issues.  The Army is seeking an innovative solution to the cosite
interference issue with minimal increase to soldier load. The solution
shall consist of an applique that is integrated onto the communications
radio.  Such an approach may consist of a"sleeve"for a handheld radio
that provides the interference cancellation capability.  The size of the
 applique shall not increase the size of the integrated system (handheld
 + applique) to more than 50% of the standalone handheld radio.  The
target platform for this applique is the AN\/PRC-154"Rifleman Radio".
The applique shall be battery powered with interconnections that are
compatible with the Rifleman Radio.    The approach must address in-band
 (within the modulation bandwidth of the primary communications signal)
interference generated by the EW system.  This interference can be a
result of products of intermodulation, harmonics, spurious emissions,
and an elevated noise floor generated by the EW system.  The approach
shall also address out of band interference generated by the
aforementioned effects as well as interference generated by the primary
EW signal(s).  It is assumed that the communications signal is not
assigned to a targeted EW frequency.  The proposed approach cannot
change the output of the EW system.  The approach shall also consider
the effects of near-by EW systems operating on adjacent soldiers in
close proximity.  The approach shall also consider the desensitation
effects that occur within the communications system as described in [1].
      The solution shall address the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW)
operating over a tuning range of 225 MHz  2 GHz.  The solution shall
provide at least 25 decibels (dB) of interference reduction, with a
target of 40 dB, within the modulation bandwidth of the SRW channel.
This shall be accomplished without a priori knowledge of the EW signal
(i.e. reference signal).    PHASE I: The Phase I effort shall include
feasibility study outlining problem considerations and potential
solutions. An analysis of theoretical limits of the various technical
approaches shall be presented in additional to practical limitations.
The Phase I effort will identify the best approach and provide a
recommendation for Phase II implementation.  The Phase I deliverable
will be a report documenting the results of the Phase I effort.    PHASE
 II: The Phase II effort shall construct and demonstrate the operation
of a prototype that will cancel cosite interference on the Soldier Radio
 Waveform.  The prototype shall cover the 225 MHz  450 MHz military
Ultra High Frequency (UHF) communications band.  The effort shall
include power considerations with respect to battery life associated
with the developed hardware.  The Phase II prototype will be tested at a
 government facility in an operationally representative environment and
shall demonstrate at least 25 dB restoration in receiver sensitivity in
the presence of the EW system.  The prototype shall be delivered to the
government with an associated user manual, interconnect diagram, and a
report documenting the results of the Phase II effort.    PHASE III:
Phase III efforts will focus on reducing the size, weight, and power of
the Phase II prototype and integrating into Army Program of Record SRW
radios.  This work will include extending the Phase II prototype to
cover additional frequency bands.  The Phase III work may also target
additional commercial off the shelf (COTS) SRW radios that are
demonstrated during the Army"s Network Integration Events (NIE) which
currently occur twice a year. The technology developed under Phase II
may also be modified and transitioned to the commercial cellular for use
 in mitigating the strong interferers in Code Division Multiple Access
(CDMA) systems.",

        "topic_name": "Cyber War Gaming",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: An innovative HW\/SW solution will be
 developed to map a computer host\/network, run attack scenarios without
 disrupting the host\/network and develop actionable courses of action
to counter real cyber-attacks.     DESCRIPTION: The Cyber domain
represents an elusive environment that the Army must defend. Over the
past two decades, our cyber defenses have been largely ineffective,
because our information systems are relatively static while our cyber
defenses have remained reactive in nature, making it fairly easy for
adversaries to explore, map, track, and then to launch decisive attacks.
 Cyber-attack threat vectors are increasing in quantity and quality.
Their level of sophistication and their ability to evade and circumvent
our defensive cyber capabilities has grown by leaps and bounds. Cyber
adversarial reasoning capabilities that can inform our defensive sensors
 about adversarial intent and thus improve attack prediction on the host
 platform and network are greatly needed. Using this solution will
deliver timely mission command &amp; tactical intelligence to provide
cyber threat situational awareness in all environments.    Today"s cyber
 battle space has seen attack threat vectors increasing in quantity and
quality. From Internet connected televisions, to SCADA systems hastily
connected to the Internet; the number of Internet connected devices have
 skyrocketed in recent years, resulting in an exponential increase in
the attack surface.  Nation state funded cyber espionage has brought
highly skilled professional hackers in the cyber battle space.
Hacktivism in the mainstream adds a new dimension to cyber warfare in
that their actions have many unforeseen consequences.  While the
motivations between hacktivism and nation state based espionage differ;
the result is the same.  Someone always wants access to the data you are
 trying to protect, or disrupt the network you rely on. In an effort to
understand this new battle space, the capabilities to analyze cyber
adversarial reasoning and predict attacks on the host and network are
needed for both strategic and tactical networks.  The tactical network
brings additional cyber issues due to a communications and networking
architecture that is resource constrained and ad-hoc in nature where
both the infrastructure and end hosts have the ability to roam on the
battlefield.  The goal of this effort is to investigate the use of host
and network based sensor agents to develop accurate host and network
maps, analyze the data for potential threat vectors and provide
aggregated threat prediction with 85% confidence.  This data can then be
 provided to an automated war gaming engine to run scenarios through the
 host and network in real-time to determine the most likely attack
vectors on the network. This approach will aide in an overall plan to
understand the adversaries strategies and tactics in order to build
real-time adaptive software\/network protection systems that will be
developed and run in this environment.  This solution will Increase
network resilience and provide the building blocks for proactive cyber
defenses. This will enable better network planning and stronger
configurations of strategic and tactical networks.    PHASE I: 1)
Develop algorithms that can reason on adversarial intent and that can
improve cyber attack prediction.  2) Develop an automated war gaming
engine to run scenarios in real-time on the host and network.  3) Show
overall feasibility of concept, with demonstration software on
representative hardware.  Concept\/approach should emphasize its
scalability to an enterprise network and a minimum of 100 nodes.  The
concept\/approach should also use major standards to ensure use in a
common operating environment to the greatest extent possible.  4)
Produce a detailed research report outlining the design and architecture
 of the system, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the
proposed approach.    PHASE II: 1) Based on the results from Phase I;
design and implement a fully functioning prototype solution for both
cyber adversarial reasoning and attack prediction and war gaming engine.
 2) Provide test and evaluation results that demonstrate the
effectiveness and accuracy of capabilities of the solution to reason on
adversarial intent and perform attack prediction on the host and
network.  3) Develop a final report describing the strategy,
architecture, design, and development of cyber adversarial reasoning and
 attack prediction and war gaming engine techniques.     PHASE III:
Phase III Dual Use Application: Further develop prototype into a
transitional product with necessary documentation for a Program of
record such as the Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T) or
Program Execution Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) for
integration into their infrastructure. This capability could be
incorporated into commercial host\/network security applications to

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Research and develop programmable RF
transceiver technology, including software, hardware and documentation
capable of fragmenting one RF transmission into multiple RF fragments
and reassembling fragments post reception to original composite.
DESCRIPTION: This Fragmented Spectrum Efficiency Manager (FSEM) system
effort is intended to provide communications capability to deliver
detection-resistant timely mission command &amp; tactical intelligence
and situational awareness in all environments. Use of Commercial Off The
 Shelf (COTS) products are important but not to the extent of
restricting research. The solution must demonstrate coherent processing
in the fragmenting of a transmission and distribution of fragments of
spectrum to four or more geosynchronous satellite paths. The solution
must also demonstrate the aggregation of the fragments post satellite
transmission. Therefore this effort requires at least two independent
hardware elements to operate geographically separated. The FSEM
fragmenting and aggregating will function in the frequency range of 1 to
 2 GHz (L-Band). The FSEM must however interface to a frequency
conversion component for transport and address satellite communications
latencies associated frequencies from C through Ka band. The FSEM must
also interface with satellite modems in the same frequency range as the
frequency conversion interface. The solution can utilize overhead
framing techniques but efficiency must be great enough to stay below the
 5% bandwidth overhead utilization threshold. Lastly, the energy per
bit, commonly referenced to a 0 dB noise figure (written in the industry
 as Eb\/N0) can grossly impact data throughput. Power levels from path
to path will vary. Satellite link performances can range from unusable
to completely error free within 2 dB Eb\/N0. The energy per bit
performance at the receive part of the modem will be a strong metric in
terms of receive quality of a satellite link in assessing FSEM
aggregation performance. The solution should incorporate leveling and
phase techniques to enable optimized aggregation. The means to fragment a
 spectrum transmission into 4 or more segments and re-aggregating
fragments successfully recovering the original data error free within
the original composite post aggregation with low bandwidth cost is the
technical risk associated with this effort.    The FSEM fragmenting
processor will have only one L-Band carrier SMA input and at least four
L-Band SMA fragment outputs. As a threshold requirement, each input and
output of the FSEM fragmenting processor must handle a single carrier
bandwidth range of 38.4 KHz through 40 MHz with an objective requirement
 of 150 Hz (or lower) through 1 GHz (or higher). The FSEM fragmenting
processor number of outputs must be programmable by the user to
distribute fragments between 0-100 percent of the original composite
input up to at least four spectrum outputs, including: replicating 100%
to one channel; 100% to each channel; and non-replicated, uneven
distribution. As an example, the FSEM fragmenting distribution
non-replicated across four channels can be: 10%, 25%, 30% and 35%.
Interfacing signal levels range from +5 to -40 dBm.     The FSEM
aggregating processor will be completely independent of the FSEM
fragmenting processor and have a corresponding minimum of four L-Band
SMA inputs and one L-Band SMA output. Each FSEM aggregating processor
channel input\/output carrier bandwidth requirements are the same as the
 FSEM fragmenting processor. Interfacing signal levels range from -25 to
 -70 dBm.    PHASE I:  In Phase I, the contractor shall develop the
architecture and the design approach for the programmable Fragmented
Spectrum Efficiency Manager (FSEM) system. The architecture and design
should, at a minimum, meet the threshold requirements identified in the
Description paragraph, above. Existing technologies such as inverse
multiplexing and packetizing are referenced as known architectures and
will not be acceptable as a Phase I deliverable due to the circuit
dependencies requiring feedback, bit stuffing and packetizing which are
inefficient methods in a SATCOM environment. The design must be state of
 the art and reflect agility in programmatically replicating in a
non-symmetrical fashion fragments of bandwidth across four or more
channels in a single direction and be re-aggregated at the receiving end
 using overhead costs within the threshold cited above. The design must
show the encoding and preamble methods used on the transmission
disassembly that provides a method of recovery at the receiver with
means to handle the varied latencies and levels encountered in the
reassembly process.    PHASE II: In Phase II, the contractor shall
build, test and deliver a prototype Fragmented Spectrum Efficiency
Manager (FSEM) tool system in accordance with the design delivered in
Phase I, to include all required hardware, software and user
documentation. The prototype shall incorporate commercial and\/or
military standards on all interfaces. The contractor shall develop and
deliver a test methodology that includes Government approved test plan,
test procedures, verification cross reference matrix (VCRM) and script
files as necessary for testing. The contractor shall support
demonstration testing at the Joint Satellite Engineering Center (JSEC)
laboratory at Aberdeen Providing Ground for one week. The prototype
system shall, at a minimum, meet the threshold requirements identified
in the Description paragraph, above. The prototype will be tested with
multiple spectral transmissions for disassembly and reassembly. The
prototype is required to be programmable and must be able to be
pre-configured by an operator to disassemble\/reassemble at programmable
 spectrum fragments and programmable bandwidth distribution sizes. The
disassembly will be handled at one location and the reassembly will be
handled at a different location therefore the prototype must consist of
two physical elements each capable of being programmed and operated
independently.    PHASE III: In Phase III, the Fragmented Spectrum
Efficiency Manager (FSEM) prototype design will be refined, optimized
and productized for transition to military Programs of Record and
commercial applications. All circuitry, fabrication and interfaces must
utilize industry recommended or military standards (i.e.; MIL-STD-530,
RS-422, etc.) wherever possible and must meet safety standards prior to
delivery and be labeled in accordance with best Commercial practices.
The Fragmented Spectrum Efficiency Manager (FSEM) system has the
potential for use in multiple emerging transmission technologies, where
there is a need for coherent fragment disassembly and reassembly along
multiple transmission lines. Immediately, the system will provide an
inherent passive Anti-Jam (AJ)\/Anti-Scintillation (AS) capability which
 will undergo testing upon delivery. The current focus is on emerging
and existing military communications systems, but this technology may
also be of use in commercial areas requiring high volume data
communications, including video. Military efforts such as Future
Advanced SATCOM Terminals (FAST) are launching efforts to expand the
digital domain in today"s transponded SATCOM. Creating a means to
programmatically traverse multiple polarizations offers a robust means
of communications impervious to man-made scintillation and interference
that if appropriately productized can be utilized throughout DoD.",

acceleration-compensated oscillator technology with a combined active
and passive compensation utilizing advanced Micro Electro-Mechanical
Systems (MEMS) packaging technology.    DESCRIPTION: C4ISR\/EW systems
mounted on high dynamic platforms such as tactical vehicles, fixed and
rotary wing aircrafts, unmanned aerial vehicles, and missiles, rely on
one or multiple oscillators generating precision frequency and time
signals to function properly. Such systems include radar systems; sensor
 systems; signals intelligence systems; GPS-aided navigation, guidance,
targeting systems; and broadband, high data rate communication systems.
   High-performance oscillators ubiquitously utilize quartz crystal
oscillators. Since those oscillators are the most acceleration-sensitive
 components in C4ISR\/EW systems, the performance of the entire system
is degraded when a platform having C4ISR\/EW systems undergoes
ever-occurring severe dynamics of accelerations, vibrations and shocks.
To overcome such degradation, the oscillators are compensated with
combined active and passive methods against severe dynamic environments.
     Today"s state-of-the-art oscillators offer the performance
acceptable for the current systems with relatively large Size, Weight,
and Power (SWAP). As future weapon systems demand better performance at
reduced Size, Weight, and Power - Cost (SWAP-C), new high-performance
acceleration-compensated oscillators need to be developed. The

        "topic_name": "Anti-Jam Antennas for GPS Pseudolites and Blue
Force Electronic Attack (BFEA) Interference Sources",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a GPS anti-jam antenna that
interoperates with both GPS pseudolites and Blue Force Electronic Attack
 (BFEA) interference sources.    DESCRIPTION: The signals transmitted by
 GPS satellites reach the surface of the earth at extremely low power
levels, and as a result, the signals are susceptible to intentional and
unintentional interference. Sources of intentional interference, known
as GPS jammers, are becoming increasingly easier to obtain and use, and
consequently, their use has become more pervasive. [1, 2]    Military
GPS receivers can be outfitted with special purpose antennas to help
mitigate the effect of jamming. These antennas, or arrays of several
antennas, create nulls in the direction of interference sources to
cancel the incoming noise. One such antenna technology, known as the
Controlled Radiation Pattern Antenna (CRPA), consists of an antenna
array and a processing unit that performs a phase-destructive sum of the
 incoming interference signals. [3]    GPS pseudolites (pseudo
satellites) are another technique utilized by the military to help
mitigate intentional GPS interference. A GPS pseudolite is a terrestrial
 or airborne platform that transmits GPS signals at power levels strong
enough to be received in a noisy environment. Pseudolites can be
deployed in a wide Area of Operation (AoO), and compatible military GPS
receivers can navigate using the signals transmitted by pseudolites. [4,
 5]    Blue Force Electronic Attack (BFEA) interference sources have the
 ability to deny the use of GPS and other satellite based navigation
systems (collectively known as GNSS) to hostile forces, while
simultaneously maintaining service to Military GPS User Equipment
(MGUE). To this end, the BFEA interference sources will broadcast
waveforms that are designed to preserve specific military GPS signals
while denying access to civilian GPS and GNSS signals.    Both of these
technologies, GPS anti-jam antennas and GPS pseudolites, are effective
at mitigating interference to GPS, or in the case of BFEA, denying its
use to hostile forces, but they are largely incompatible. That is, a
receiver with a GPS anti-jam antenna could null the strong signals
produced by a GPS pseudolite, mistaking it as an interference source.
 The goal of this SBIR effort is to develop a GPS anti-jam antenna that
interoperates with both GPS pseudolites and Blue Force Electronic Attack
 (BFEA) interference sources. The antenna shall be capable of receiving
military GPS signals, civilian GPS signals, and GPS pseudolite signals.
The antenna shall also be capable of nulling several hostile
interference sources, and ignoring any BFEA interference sources. The
antenna shall accomplish these tasks simultaneously, that is, it shall
receive GPS signals from satellites or pseudolites, while ignoring
hostile and BFEA interference sources. The initial intent is to deploy
these anti-jam antennas on ground and air platforms, specifically
platforms that will emit the pseudolite or BFEA signals. Antennas
co-mounted on these platforms shall be capable of ignoring the strong
emissions mounted nearby.    PHASE I: Design a novel military GPS
anti-jam antenna capable of simultaneously receiving military GPS
signals, civilian GPS signals, GPS pseudolite signals, and nulling or
ignoring interference sources. Develop the overall antenna design and
antenna processing unit.    PHASE II: Develop a prototype GPS anti-jam
antenna capable of simultaneously receiving military GPS signals,
civilian GPS signals, GPS pseudolite signals, and nulling or ignoring
interference sources. Demonstrate this capability in a controlled
laboratory environment.    PHASE III: This anti-jam antenna system could
 potentially be used in a broad range of military applications where
access to GPS would otherwise be denied or degraded due to hostile
interference. For example, if the Army is conducting operations in an
area where GPS signals are denied as a result of hostile interference
sources, but GPS pseudolites are deployed to help mitigate this issue,
the anti-jam antenna system would allow a military GPS receiver access
to the pseudolite signals while at the same time, it will nullify any
interference sources in the area. This will give the receiver a much
greater advantage over using either one of those technologies alone. The
 anti-jam antenna system could also be installed on GPS pseudolites,
since they will likely be used in environments where GPS is denied or
degraded and where BFEA sources are deployed. Commercial applications
include government agencies employing GPS devices in the pursuit of
criminals using GPS jammers, or transportation systems that employ GPS
augmentation signals for improved tracking.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Development of a dual-frequency-band
imaging radar operating at L-band and Ka-band with GMTI and"video
SAR"capabilities for use on small manned and unmanned aircraft.
DESCRIPTION: With different frequency bands, a radar can get very
different views of the world.  A low frequency radar, operating at
L-band for example, will image the larger features of terrain,
vegetation, and man-made targets due to the use of a longer wavelength
signal.  A very high frequency radar operating at Ka-band will image the
 same area very differently due to fine scale backscattering of the
short wavelength signal.  In addition, a Ka-band SAR can rapidly form a
series of images of a target area that can be viewed sequentially at a
sufficient frame rate, providing a"video SAR"view.  Each frequency band
has advantages in detecting different types of targets, especially when
used to support advanced exploitation algorithms (e.g. SAR change
detection, GMTI tracking, SAR &amp; GMTI target recognition).  A
lightweight dual-band system for a small platform introduces challenges
in power and processor management, yet it provides a significant payoff
by increasing the chance of detecting targets of interest.    The system
 must:  - Provide SAR and GMTI modes at L-band and Ka-band  - Operate
from 3,000 to 10,000 feet AGL  - NES0 = -30 dB m2\/m2  - MNR = -18 dB  -
 Cover a swath 5 km wide at L-band, and 0.5 km wide at Ka-band (at
finest resolution)  - Have a maximum weight of 35 lbs  - Provide 1 meter
 range resolution at L-band  - Provide 10 cm range resolution at Ka-band
  - GMTI minimum detectable velocity of 2.3 m\/s at L-band (at 75 knots
aircraft ground speed)  - GMTI minimum detectable velocity of 0.5 m\/s
at Ka-band (at 75 knots aircraft ground speed)  - Provide"video SAR"at
Ka-band with a frame rate of 3 fps    PHASE I: Expected deliverables are
 a detailed radar system design, performance estimation, and a schedule
and work-plan for completing Phase II.  The radar system design includes
 details on data processing, including SAR image formation and GMTI
Doppler processing.  Performance estimation may include modeling and
simulation.  Included in the Phase II work plan is a proposal of the
expected utility of the system and compatibility\/effectiveness with
exploitation algorithms.    PHASE II: Phase II includes the development
and demonstration of a prototype radar system.  Performance measurements
 are to be made to validate that (A) the system meets the system
requirements over the range of operational altitudes and (B) the imagery
 can be exploited to detect targets of interest.  Image products are to
be compliant with current standards (NITF 2.1 for SAR, STANAG 4607 for
GMTI).  The test data and results are to be provided to the Army as part
 of a final report detailing the work done in Phase II.    PHASE III:
The completion of this phase would result in a mature technology which
would undergo an appropriate operational demonstration following
integration onto manned and\/or unmanned military aircraft.  The
technology developed under this SBIR would also have commercial
applicability, as small form factor Ka-band sensors may have utility as
collision avoidance sensors in commercial aircraft.",

        "topic_name": "Current Source for Magnetic Sensor",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To design, develop and build a
prototype RF current source or RF power amplifier that drives the type
of low impedance magnetic current loop for the magnetic sensor described
 below.     DESCRIPTION: Operation of the sensor is dependent on the
magnetic field that is projected and that in turn is directly related to
 the current in the magnetic current loop. Conventional 50 ohm
amplifiers require considerable matching resulting in a narrow bandwidth
 and excessive operational sensitivity. Current bandwidths are less than
 0.5 % and it is expected that an RF current source will provide a
bandwidth of greater than 10%. This will allow for much greater
flexibility of mounting configurations. The only option today is to use a
 50 ohm power amplifier. Using a conventional 50 ohm power amplifier
requires a matching network to transform from 50 ohms to approx.
1.005-j3.09 ohms. Thus, the conventional approach would be to start with
 a voltage controlled current source to a 50 ohm power amplifier which
is then impedance matched to 1.005-j3.09 ohms. This process provides for
 a maximum bandwidth of only 1% and results in poor efficiency.
Developing a RF current source or RF power amplifier that drives a low
impedance magnetic sensor will result in a minimum of a 10x increase in
bandwidth and approximately a 5-10x reduction in required power with the
 sensor operating at approx. 1.005-j3.09 ohms. This type of magnetic
sensor can easily penetrate the ground to detect deeply buried threats,
such as landmines, etc., while its design will reduce unwanted
electromagnetic (EM) interference. The commercial and military
applications include the development of greatly improved metal\/anomaly
sensors.     The concept behind transmitting a large magnetic field
while minimizing the generation of a propagating EM wave, is to use a
current loop in which the current around the loop has a constant
magnitude and a constant phase [1].  Usually in a current loop sensor
the current changes phase around the loop and this phase change
generates a propagating EM signal. By keeping both the magnitude and
phase constant, little EM signal is projected but a strong magnetic
signal is produced that extends normal to the plane of the loop creating
 a large magnetic field in the near field.  This field will penetrate
conducting dielectrics such as ground which have little effect on the
magnetic field but substantially terminate the electric field and thus, a
 propagating EM wave. In [1] the in-phase current loop is created using
multiple small loops. In [2] an in-phase current loop design is
presented in which reactive compensation is used.  Periodic series
capacitors placed around the loop compensate for
the"time-of-flight"phase change along a segment of the loop.  Thus a
magnetic current loop was developed for use in a
magnetic-current-loop-based communication system. This design divided
the loop into small segments and reactive compensation is added to each
segment. Adding reactive compensation to each segment of the loop
cancels the series reactance of each segment of the loop and provides
for current magnitude and phase uniformity along the loop at any given
instant in time [2]. We have built and modeled such a magnetic sensor
and the impedance at 13.56 MHz is around 1.005-j3.09 ohms [3].
PHASE I: The contractor shall conduct a feasibility study to develop a
current source which can greatly improve the bandwidth and reduce the
required power needed to drive a low impedance magnetic sensor. The
contractor shall submit a report which shall detail the results of the
feasibility study of the sensor to be used to perform this mission. The
report should contain a description of the sensor, as well as technical
details of how the sensor will perform the required task(s) and expected
 performance. A brief high level plan for phase II work should be
included in this report in the event of a phase II selection.    PHASE
II: The contractor shall develop a robust prototype sensor based on the
results of the Phase I effort. The prototype sensor will be able to be
drive a low impedance magnetic sensor and demonstrate an ability to
penetrate the ground to detect deeply buried threats. A demonstration of
 the sensor will be done at a location determined by the government.
PHASE III: Based upon Phase II results the sensor will be improved upon
and optimized for commercialization. Multiple military programs and
commercial applications can benefit from this sensor including: R &amp; D
 laboratories and both military and commercial metal\/anomaly sensor
developers\/manufactures. The most likely path for transition to
operational capability is development of a superior metal\/anomaly
sensor than the sensors presently available.",

Difference of Arrival (TDOA) radio geolocation remote sensor system that
 uses a physically small antenna. The High Frequency remote sensor
system will be capable and effective at providing accurate geolocation
coordinates on High Frequency radios using NVIS (Near Vertical Incidence
 Skywave) communication mode.    DESCRIPTION: Geolocation of High
Frequency (HF) Radios using Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) mode
propagation with a remote sensor system using TDOA (Time Difference of
Arrival) technique is needed for providing force protection for an area
of operations. Innovation is required in developing TDOA processing of
HF NVIS signals. There are many challenges to be met and problems to be
solved to select and verify the same wave point on the received signal
and then accurately time stamp the same point on the wave and then an
algorithm to process the time stamped signal to provide a
line-of-bearing. Multiple lines-of-bearings must be processed to
determine accurately the geolocation of the radio. The processing of the
 time stamped data must be processed with the uniqueness of the HF
ground-wave taken into account. The system must isolate the ground-wave
from the direct-wave and sky-wave. Primary requirement of this research
task is to provide solutions to these challenges in the form of a low
cost remote sensor system that provides persistent surveillance of an
area to be monitor for extended periods of time.      Research and
development efforts have been completed in the past using aircraft as
TDOA platforms to provide LOB (lines-of-bearing) on ground based HF
emitters on direct-wave propagation. Much work on ground base systems
have be completed in the past using very large antenna arrays to do
single station location of HF skywave mode communications but these are
ineffective and not accurate against NVIS mode communications. Large DF
antenna arrays have been used in single station location system but
these are too large to be used as a deployable force protection ground
based system. None of these approaches satisfy the requirements for
deployable force protection and persistent surveillance for imminent
threat warnings or detection and geolocation of HF interferers for
spectrum management purposes.     Capability to get LOB and geolocation
of HF radios using NVIS communications links is desired for remote
sensors providing force protection over the area of operations. Ground
remote sensors are the best solution for area of operation deployable
force protection. These remote sensors must be easy to deploy and low
cost given the installation in remote locations that makes the sensor
vulnerable to be lost.    This research effort would use innovative
control and data processing of a remote wideband spectrum surveillance
receiver system with organic precision time stamping of RF events. The
research would involve developing a processing system by means of TDOA
technique applicable to HF  NVIS communications to process the data
collected by the wideband receive system to locate HF transmitters.
Ground based remote sensor geolocation of NVIS emitters using a TDOA
algorithm is the primary research area.     Man power and support is a
major factor in the research and design approach of the sensor system.
Minimum personnel time to deploy, operate and maintain the system is a
key goal for this sensor system. The sensor system must not be dependent
 on availability of commercial or generator power. It must use renewable
 power and be compatible with multiple power sources.    PHASE I: Will
consist of researching past approaches to using TDOA for geolocation of
HF transmitters and provide a detailed design of a low cost ground based
 HF deployable remote sensor system. The sensor system must be easily
deployed, use renewable power, data processor system, and software
system that can be easily integrated into current geolocation systems.
Data format must be compatible with deployable force protection
situational awareness database system and other national database
systems. The cost to build a demonstration system shall be provided and
estimated cost to build six field evaluation systems.    PHASE II:
Develop a HF TDOA remote sensor demonstration system based on the

deploy and operate the sensor system.    PHASE III: Fully develop the

display.  Current military fielded systems require a Soldier to either
interrupt their current actions by looking at a handheld device, or by
raising their weapon to look through a device  taking up valuable time,
and potentially causing an escalation of force.  Both are undesirable
actions, increasing workload and creating hostile situations. A common
input wireless display for dismounted Soldier applications would be a
capability enabler.  It would allow the presentation of Mission Command
information such as situational awareness queuing, tactical maps, or
sensor imagery.  Additionally, video from other Soldier mounted sensors
such as weapon sights, handheld targeting systems and sensor data from
Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) could be displayed.  Wireless
transmission of this video is important, for remote video sources, and
for human factors considerations - as tethered solutions limit mobility,
 and create snag hazards.  As more capability gaps are addressed, more
equipment will be available for the Soldier to utilize, so much so that
information overload can occur.  A display with common input can allow
the Soldier to switch inputs quickly, without having to switch between
systems in their hands.      There has been considerable research into
Heads-Up Display (HUD) technology  spanning decades  which has been
primarily in the aviation community.  Within the aviation community, HUD
 devices are either fixed-frame or helmet mounted.    Relevant fielded
systems to the Soldier include NAVAID, AN\/AVS-7(V), Land Warrior, Nett
Warrior, and accessory devices, such as the HTWS Head mounted display
(HMD).  These systems provide different capabilities, such as
navigational assistance, piloting information, map display, and sensor
data in various look up, see-through, and occluded configurations.
Accessory displays, such as the Tac-Eye or Red-I are available for
military equipment.    Relevant commercial systems include a multitude
of portable multimedia players integrated into eyewear allowing for
discreet, occluded, wired viewing of video with various display
resolutions.  These however are wired solutions, and require physically
unplugging and changing inputs to the system.    Recently products have
come onto the commercial market such as low resolution GPS enabled ski
goggles, capable of displaying performance statistics, but not video, in
 a look down configuration.  Combining these capabilities and Point of
View (POV) sports cameras, exist products such as the Recon Jet  a
glasses mounted, look down occluded display, capable of displaying
video.  Other products include Google Glass - marketed as a smart phone
accessory, in a look-up, transparent, configuration, able to display
video from a nearby smart phone.    A wireless, high-definition,
see-through display would be a capability enabler  providing a platform
for weapon mounted sensors to stream video, UAS data, mapping, and
navigation, situational awareness queuing, such as targeting, gunshot
detection, and Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA).  In the far future, a
common display platform could de-couple the requirement for every system
 used by the Soldier to include a display  potentially reducing costs
across systems.  Similar to how modern televisions functions, a Soldier
would need to simply change the input to their common display.    PHASE
I: Develop a detailed design of proposed Dismount Soldier Display with
Wireless input (DSDW).  Perform a tradeoff study of candidate
configurations (including the specific see-through display technology)
and components, and identify the best solution in terms of SWaP and
performance.  The final report shall also provide an estimate of the
display"s cost, size, weight, and power consumption. Innovative mounting
 techniques to eyewear or the helmet is encouraged.    Requirements

Protective Eyewear Cylindrical System (SPECS) [MIL-PRF-31013] and items

4.  DSDW shall not impede the use of PVS7 Night Vision Goggles (NVG),
PVS14 NVG or PSQ20 Enhanced Night Vision Goggle (ENVG), and be able to
be worn simultaneously with a pair of NVGs.  5.  The wireless video
protocol and interface will be determined as part of this effort.  6.
Source video will be digital only.  7.  The DSDW shall not exceed 0.5lb
(threshold), 0.1 lb (objective) including batteries.  8.  DSDW should be

security.  22. Distance from transmitter to DSDW shall not exceed 3
meters.    PHASE II: Finalize design configurations and interfaces with
Critical Design Review, and integrate wireless display prototypes (2
minimum) for Soldier demonstration and evaluation. Information and
design approaches from the SBIR effort(s) will support Army Research and
 Development of a Common Wireless Display for Dismounted Soldier
applications.    PHASE III: Wireless interface for display of high
resolution video and sensor information has multiple military, law
enforcement, and civilian applications  for example, as accessories to
mobile smart phones as augmented reality displays, for sporting related
activities to display performance information, and as replacements or
accessories for laptop, tablet and computer displays, video gaming, and
for wireless home video transmission.",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Design and develop techniques to
detect emplaced roadside EFPs using vehicular mounted forward-looking
active or passive sensor technologies.      DESCRIPTION: The roadside
environment is often a less homogenous background than that of the
adjacent road.  Roadways are generally clear of surface clutter but may
have varying degree of subsurface stratum.  Roadside environments may
contain a variety of roadway infrastructure including curbs, signs,
sidewalks and unstructured terrain including vegetation, plants, trees
and debris.  EFP weapons are often camouflaged roadside emplacements
within the cluttered roadside environment.  Detection of these threats
is the focus of this SBIR Topic.    PHASE I:  The Phase I goal is for a
vendor to utilize modeled\/simulated data or government furnished
data1,2 of EFPs to demonstrate emerging analytical techniques and
concepts that extract features unique to EFP targets.  The EFP feature
concepts and techniques must be leveraged in Phase II, e.g. range,
intensity, texture, RCS, etc., and must be documented for and
demonstrated to government Subject Matter Experts.  Fully autonomous
algorithms are not required during this Phase I.  The Phase I final
report must contain a full description of the EFP surrogate target(s),
sensor data, and description of and rationale for the features chosen
and identified taking into consideration concealing foliage and
camouflage.  The report must also provide recommendations of feature(s)
for further investigation.    PHASE II:  The Phase II goal is to
prototype autonomous algorithms for detecting and tracking EFPs.  These
algorithms must be implemented with either the target or sensor in
transit.  The techniques\/algorithms used and sensor data will be
provided to the Government for evaluation.  The vendor"s Phase II final
report must include algorithm performance estimates for terrain and
vegetation conditions resident within the datasets.  The report must
also include recommendations for algorithm improvements.    PHASE
III\/CPP:   The Phase III goal is to further develop the techniques or
algorithms from the Phase II effort to a mature state, proof of
technological feasibility, such that they can be implemented in a real
time detection system with potential fielding through the normal DoD
acquisition process.  Products might lead to enhanced commercial mounted
 avoidance scanning systems for automobiles or possibly as track ballast
 and throughway inspection systems for trains on railways.    DoD
applications might include sensor technology for a wide range of side
attack threat munitions detection.",

Fine Grained Access Control",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a framework for a secure,
standards based Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) solution that is
capable of dynamically redacting and filtering data within the DIB Query
 Service (1.3 and later) SOAP endpoint and is interoperable with Simple
Object Access Protocol (SOAP) Dial-Tone, Distributed Common Ground
System (DCGS) Directory Information Base (DIB), and Distributed Common
Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) architectures.    DESCRIPTION: The current
DCGS-A systems were built to provide best in class data services at the
time and are in need of architecture enhancements to support current
guidance. The current deployed DIB systems lack identity and attribute
awareness, leaving DCGS-A with systems that have constricted security
boundaries. These boundaries impair a warfighter"s ability to use
information resources beyond the user"s immediate visibility, awareness,
 or access.      To comply with Intelligence Community (IC) Directives,
DCGS-A requires the capability to redact and filter federated data
within the DIB (1.3 and later) Query Service SOAP endpoint, in a manner
that allows the re-use of existing deployed architectures to the
greatest extent possible and supports information-sharing efforts,
actionable intelligence, and use of new and emerging IT technologies
(e.g. cloud and shared computing services). In the fielded system, it is
 currently not possible to redact or filter information accessed within
the DIB Query Service SOAP endpoint.       A standards-based ABAC
solution would take in attributes and access control policies and return
 only data that the entity is allowed to see. Solution architecture for
this effort will incorporate SOAP Dial-Tone, Distributed Common
Ground\/Surface System (DCGS) Multi-Service Execution Team (MET) Office
(DMO) DIB architectures, and DCGS-A"s fine-grained Attribute-Based
Access Control (ABAC) mechanisms. This solution will address
Intelligence Community Directive 501 (ICD 501) The Discovery and
Dissemination or Retrieval of Information within the Intelligence
Community, ICD 503 Intelligence Community Information Technology Systems
 Security Risk Management, Certification and Accreditation, and other
relevant DoD\/IC guidance and net centric requirements. The solution
will leverage IC security markings maintained by the Office of the
Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)\/Controlled Access Program
Coordination Office (CAPCO) and XML Data Encoding Specification for
Information Security Marking Metadata V9 (ISM.XML.V9) 17 July 12.
Previous efforts to be leveraged include DMO"s DIB 2.0 PL3 certification
 and the DMO DIB 1.3 Redaction demonstration to support architecture and
 system development design goals.    PHASE I: Prepare a feasibility
study for a framework solution that can redact and filter data elements
for Product Retrieval and Dissemination within SOAP-based DIB (1.3 and
later) Query Service, accessible through DCGS-A ABAC architecture. This
framework will support Special Operations Forces (SOF) and Army (513),
with the Army as the producer node. The attribute store will be setup in
 the consumer node. The Army node will setup a trust between the
consumer and producer Secure Token Service (STS).    PHASE II: Using the
 resulting materials and\/or designs from Phase I, develop Integrated
Master Schedule with resource allocation and assemble a prototype to
demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the solution. Benchmark and
identify production tasks, system throughput, scaling of capabilities,
use of identity, policies, attributes, management of policies,
management of attributes and auditing for production. Use the resulting
prototype to support an Interoperability Demonstration Pilot.    PHASE
III: Operationalize the dissemination of the solution within DCGS-A and
DIB. Prepare the roadmap to guide related efforts and support
accreditation.     DUAL USE COMMERCIALIZATION: Military Application:

        "topic_name": "A LIDAR for Mapping Dense Aerosols",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to develop a
scanning lidar to measure the spatial evolution of dense obscurant
clouds (one way transmission 0.25%) with high temporal and spatial
resolution.  The system should be capable of measuring an obscurant
concentration point cloud contained in a 10x10x10 meter measurement
volume with sample spacing of 1\/5 meters and a total 3D cloud update
rate of 1Hz.  This measurement scenario supports the development of
advanced obscurants and methods to disseminate them effectively
DESCRIPTION: Smoke and obscurants play a crucial role in protecting the
Warfighter by decreasing the electromagnetic energy available for the
functioning of sensors, seekers, trackers, optical enhancement devices
and the human eye.  Recent advances in materials science now enable the
production of precisely engineered obscurants with nanometer level
control over particle size and shape.  Numerical modeling predicts that
order of magnitude increases over current performance levels are
possible if high aspect-ratio conductive particles can be effectively
disseminated as an unagglomerated aerosol cloud.    The high efficiency
of these materials makes field evaluation a challenge.  One
dissemination mechanism packages the material into a grenade and
functions one or more units for personal, vehicle or even wide area
screening. During the first few seconds of an event, the obscurant cloud
 is optically dense and rapidly evolving.  A non-invasive means to
determine concentration over time and space would be an invaluable tool
for obscurant development.      Lidar systems have been used to
successfully characterize obscurant clouds (Uthe) during military
obscurant testing.  While these systems did not have the spatial
resolution needed for current testing, lessons learned from evaluating
dense obscurant clouds and multiple scattering are relevant for this
effort.  More recently, scanning lidar systems have been proposed for
situational awareness during degraded visual environment (DVE) scenarios
 (Xiaoying).  Obscurants and Chemical \/ Biological clouds are aerosols.
  Lidars can be used for detection and evaluation of any aerosol cloud.
 The obscurant clouds are a more difficult case because they are
optically dense.  This is the reason for the topic: no lidar has been
developed with the capability to penetrate an obscurant aerosol and map
the density profile of the cloud.    The high resolution required along
the line of site requires a high speed detector and digitizer.
Currently available electronics do not have the dynamic range to measure
 the round trip transmission through the obscurant cloud.  This
challenge could be mitigated by transmitting multiple pulses along each
line of site through the cloud; however the need to scan a 3D point
cloud limits the number of pulses that can be combined for each line of
site.  Using multiple apertures or changing other lidar parameters over a
 small number of pulses are possible methods to solve this problem.
Another method for cloud penetration is to use a portion of the
electromagnetic spectrum where the material is less efficient.
Unfortunately, obscurant materials are typically broadband and are being
 developed to cover all portions of the electromagnetic spectrum of
military interest.  Thus, other techniques will need to be developed to
achieve the required dynamic range.    PHASE I: Design a lidar system
that map the 3D concentration of an evolving obscurant cloud in a
10x10x10 meter volume.  The design should address the dynamic range
needed to measure path transmittance though the cloud of 0.25% or less
while maintaining high spatial resolution inside the cloud.    PHASE II:
 Fabricate, test and demonstrate a LIDAR system that meets the
specifications described in Phase I.  This prototype system will take
the laboratory designed system and hardware and package it into a
fieldable unit.  Housing for this unit should be weatherproof to
withstand conditions in an outdoor environment.  In addition to
fabricating a prototype unit, the contractor with thoroughly test it
alongside Army personnel at the Army's Edgewood Chemical and Biological
Center (ECBC) test range.  Standard Military smokes and obscurants will
be used to evaluate the prototype instruments performance.  A final
report shall be produced by contractor using data provided by the Army
on the various aerosol clouds dispensed.  Prepare a cost estimate for
building the system in quantity.    PHASE III: The lidar system
developed in this program can be used by research and development
organizations and test ranges to evaluate obscurant munitions and
devices.  It has application in other DoD interest areas including
chemical and biological detection, aircraft landing aids, meteorology
and pollution control.  Industrial applications could be very similar to
 these.",

        "topic_name": "A Novel Method for Creating Microshear to
Aerosolize Packed Powders",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop a concept which produces
microshear to efficiently separate and disseminate fine powders that are
 densely packed within a container.  Concepts should address material
agglomeration issues that arise with optimized packing densities.  A
systematic study of the forces necessary to overcome binding effects of
the materials could be developed along with mathematical modeling to
support separation concepts.  This problem is compounded by the fact
that in general, high packing densities are employed to maximize the
yield of obscurant devices.  Improved methods to separate these highly
compressed materials are needed.     DESCRIPTION: Smoke and obscurants
play a crucial role in protecting the Warfighter by decreasing the
electromagnetic energy available for the functioning of sensors,
seekers, trackers, optical enhancement devices and the human eye.
Recent advances in materials science now enable the production of
precisely engineered obscurants with nanometer level control over
particle size and shape.  Numerical modeling predicts that order of
magnitude increases over current performance levels are possible if high
 aspect-ratio conductive particles can be effectively disseminated as an
 unagglomerated aerosol cloud.    Recent history demonstrates that when
these designer particles are packed into a center-burster grenade
configuration, obscuration performance can decrease by more than an
order of magnitude, canceling the performance increases inherent in the
particles.  There is clearly no mechanism in the present design that
acts to separate particles from one another.  That is the need.    In
the classic center-burster configuration used by the Army for grenades,
it is speculated that the shock wave provides no aid in deagglomeration
(and may, in fact, contribute to agglomeration) because it passes
through the confined material before aerosolization begins.  The
container is ruptured by the shock wave, but only after it has passed
through the fill material.  Consequently, an entirely new concept design
 may be required to take advantage of the energy contained in the shock
wave and\/or of the compact storage of energy in explosives of any sort.
    The modeling of explosives and resultant shock waves is still in
development.  Classic treatment of the phenomenon does not take into
account the extreme temperatures, pressures and velocities, resulting in
 erroneous calculations.  More accurate methods should be considered.
  PHASE I: Demonstrate, with modeling or other means, a concept that
will create forces to separate anisotropic particles when disseminated.
 Demonstrate by electronic means or in the laboratory how the concept
works.  Estimate the separation efficiency possible.    The Army is
interested in a device the size of a Coke can, although any size can be
used to demonstrate the concept in Phase I.  Anisotropic powders to
consider for demonstration purposes include fine metal or graphite
flakes.     PHASE II: Prepare devices that will demonstrate the
mechanism.  Provide 5 such items to ECBC for measurement of separation
efficiency achieved. In Phase II, a design of a manufacturing process to
 commercialize the concept should be developed.     Present grenades
used for disseminating fine powders achieve roughly a 30% packing
efficiency, a 40% dissemination efficiency and can reduce the extinction
 efficiency of the material (through agglomeration and destruction or
modification) of the particles by 50%.  This results in a total
efficiency of about 6%.  The goal of this effort should be to double
that number.     Consider how the design would change to effectively
disseminate microfibers of graphite or metal.     PHASE III: The
techniques developed in this program can be integrated into current and
future military obscurant applications.  Improved grenades and other
munitions are needed to reduce the current logistics burden of
countermeasures to protect the soldier and his equipment.  This
technology could have application in other DoD interest areas including
high explosives, fuel\/air explosives and decontamination.  Improved
separation techniques can be beneficial for all powdered materials in
the metallurgy, ceramic, pharmaceutical and fuel industries.  Industrial
 applications could include metal hardening, metal cladding, seismic
exploration, destruction of hazardous waste and welding.",

        "topic_name": "Development of Phage-Quantum Dot Based Diagnostic
 Tools for Biological Agents",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Development of a novel platform for
the detection\/diagnosis of biological agents harnessing the specificity
 of attachment of phage to bacteria and the sensitivity of Quantum Dot
(QD) nanocrystals.     DESCRIPTION: An ideal detection\/diagnosis
technology\/platform would have the following desirable properties: the
potential for rapid, high-sensitive (detection at very low
concentrations of the agent), high-specific (high true positive\/true
negative and low false-positive\/low false-negative) detection of agents
 of interest in a low background interference.  Also, the platform to
conduct the assays should be user-friendly, portable and include a point
 of care or field device that is capable of detecting multiple agents
simultaneously in a high throughput manner in any matrix type (clinical
or environmental). Additionally, it is highly desirable to have a
flexible technology amenable for a plug and play format to develop new
assays rapidly and above all, the technology should be inexpensive to
manufacture and operate.     Currently, there are two general paradigms
in bioagent detection: protein based immunodiagnostics and nucleic acid
based PCR diagnostics. Although numerous current technologies address
many of the desired characteristics, none of the existing
technologies\/platforms meet all these requirements. For example, some
immuno diagnostics technologies based on Lateral Flow Immunoassay are
rapid and inexpensive, user-friendly and field deployable but lack
sensitivity, have high background issues and almost always needs
confirmatory assays from another technology. The nucleic acid based
assays are rapid, easy to develop and relatively user-friendly and field
 deployable but lack multiplexing and high throughput and may have
background (false positive) issues and interference issues from some
matrix types.     The purpose of this topic is to explore the potential
of a third paradigm, phage based diagnostics, to address many if not all
 of the limitations of the currently fielded assays and instruments, and
 to leverage existing platforms. The general concept is to harness the
specificity (natural or engineered) of attachment of phages or phage
proteins to bioagents in addition to exploiting the sensitivity of
Quantum Dots for developing a fluorescent detection technology that can
be used in currently fielded detection platforms. Phages are also useful
 for live agent detection unlike the current approaches that can detect
both live and inactive agents.     The proof of concept for phage
Quantum Dot technology has been established in some phage-bacterial
systems1, 2. The specificity of phages to their cognate bacterial
species or strain is fairly well established. It is also conceivable to
engineer specificity for any type of agent onto phages using affinity
panning3.  Quantum Dots are superior to many other fluorophores
available today. They have a broad absorption spectrum and a narrow
emission spectrum, highly tunable based on size and hence multiplex
detection of agents is possible. Quantum Dots can also be synthesized to
 carry specific functional groups or moieties on their surface for
binding specific agents.    This topic seeks technologies to demonstrate
 the utility of a phage-QD assay in a platform that can be readily
fielded. Some of the proposed paths are: manipulate whole phage or phage
 structures such as tail fibers, or phage tail fiber like bacteriocins5,
 phage proteins such as cell wall binding domains of endolysins6,
(modify to chemically link a functional group such as biotin or
genetically engineer phage\/protein to express a functional moiety such
as biotin binding peptide on the surface) and use Quantum Dots for
detection upon binding to specific bacteria. Engineering a universal
phage with binding specificities in combination with QD for detection of
 any agent type (spore, vegetative cells or protein) is also desired.
  PHASE I: This phase will demonstrate the feasibility of the phage-QD
assay in a user-friendly, fieldable fluorescent detection system.
Milestones and deliverables for Phase I:    Demonstrate a phage\/phage
protein-bacterium-QD assay detection in a biodefense relevant pathogen
(e.g., B. anthracis vegetative cells or spore, Y. pestis etc.) in a
fieldable platform    Demonstrate multiplex capability   Delineate assay
 sensitivity and LoD in buffer and a clinical matrix   Produce a summary
 report of the results that demonstrates a comparative evaluation,
establishes suitability of the technology, and provides research
findings with supplemental documentation to justify selection by
providing insights into expanding the proposed technology to other
agents of interest. A clear description of a path forward for expanding
the technology to other agents of interest is required    PHASE II: This
 phase will involve expanding the work performed in Phase I to include
multiple agents and developing a 510 K package for FDA licensure of the
platform technology.    Milestones and deliverables for Phase II:
Expand the phage-QD detection concept for detection of viral agents and
proteins such as toxins   Develop inclusivity\/exclusivity testing of a
phage-bacterial pair   Develop and establish LoD for the assays
Conduct clinical trials with contrived samples or real specimens to
establish sensitivity\/specificity   Prepare initial packages for
submission to FDA    PHASE III: This phase will expand the work in Phase
 II in integrating and commercialization\/fielding of the platform.
Milestones and deliverables for Phase III:   Extend the work
accomplished in Phase II. Focus will be on integrating the Phase II
assays with the fieldable platform    Demonstrate the multiplexing and
high-throughput applications in a field\/point of care setting
Establish quantitative parameters of detection    Describe a
commercialization strategy of the technology to commercial healthcare
settings and \/or transition to military operations and acquisitions
PHASE III Dual Use Applications: Further research and development during
 Phase III efforts will be directed towards expanding the panel of
phages for detection of all bacterial and viral pathogens of interest to
 the medical community beyond DoD using the plug and play format
afforded by this technology.  Inexpensive, portable fluorescence readers
 with the ability to exceed visual detection limits and to document test
 results would find extensive use by first responders, in civilian
medical facilities, in the public health field, and for point of care
diagnostics in remote regions throughout the world.",

the ricin toxin.    To that end, the goal of this SBIR topic is to
solicit innovative approaches to improved serum half-life of the
protective monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for prophylaxis and\/or therapy
against ricin intoxication.  The approaches may include but are not
restricted to methods to reduce mAb degradation, use of genetically
derived immunoglobulin glycoforms, methods to reduce hepatic turnover of
 mAbs, methods to create slow-release mAb depots and combinations
thereof. The specific improvements in duration should be determined
using baseline values and ideally technologies will be developed to
improve mAb duration 2-fold or more.     PHASE I: Phase I studies will
focus on development of proof-of-concept in vitro and in vivo models and
 prototyping systems to modify ricin-specific mAbs.    PHASE II: Studies
 in Phase II will include small scale process development, production of
 material for in vivo potency and pharmokinetic\/pharmodynamic studies
in small animals and culminate in a pharmokinetic\/pharmodynamic study
in a non-human primate (NHP) model.    PHASE III: Studies in this phase
will focus on scale-up manufacturing, toxicity and potency assessment in
 appropriate animal models, followed by cGMP manufacturing, pivotal
efficacy studies in NHPs and clinical trials.    PHASE III Dual Use
Applications:   It is anticipated that successful development of a
platform strategy to improved mAb half-life will have dual use in both
improved mAb countermeasures for the warfighter and improved therapeutic
 mAbs for use as pharmaceutics.",

        "topic_name": "Modernized Production of Enteric Coated Live,
Oral Adenovirus Vaccine",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop novel technological methods
for oral delivery of live adenovirus compared to the current
FDA-licensed product,"Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live,
Oral"(Barr Labs, Inc.).  The new methods should provide material
benefits in terms of production and comparable safety and
immunogenicity.    DESCRIPTION: Adenoviruses are a frequent cause of
epidemic acute respiratory disease (ARD) in military basic recruits and
pose a significant threat to military readiness, especially during times
 of large mobilization.  ARD is a debilitating febrile disease that
frequently results in loss of training time, hospitalization and
pneumonia and, on occasion, death. There is no FDA-licensed treatment
option available for adenovirus.  Before vaccines were available,
adenovirus was isolated in 30-70% of recruits with ARD and 90% of cases
of pneumonia.  The vast majority of adenovirus infections in recruits is
 caused by types 4 and 7, although types 14 and 21 have also caused
severe outbreaks.    A live oral vaccine against adenovirus type 4 was
developed in the 1960s and determined by clinical studies to be safe and
 effective in preventing ARD due to adenovirus type 4.  Subsequently, a
similar live oral adenovirus type 7 vaccine was developed.  After
extensive testing, these vaccines were approved by the FDA and
manufactured by Wyeth Laboratories in 1980.  The Wyeth adenovirus
vaccines were very safe and effective in eliminating outbreaks of ARD in
 recruits.  However, in 1995 Wyeth elected to cease production and all
DoD supplies were depleted by 1999.  With the loss of the vaccine,
adenovirus outbreaks and deaths in basic recruits returned to
pre-vaccine levels.  DoD contracted with Barr Laboratories to develop
replacement live oral adenovirus vaccines.  The new Barr Adenovirus
vaccines were demonstrated to be safe and effective and were licensed by
 the FDA in March 2011.  The vaccines are administered to all new basic
recruits in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard.    The
Barr and Wyeth vaccines are intentionally very similar.  The type 4 and 7
 virus strains in both vaccines are identical and both vaccines are
prepared in WI-38 cell cultures.  Both vaccines are similarly formulated
 as enteric coated tablets containing either adenovirus type 4 or
adenovirus type 7 (at least 32,000 tissue-culture infective doses per
tablet).  The vaccine is described as a"tablet within a tablet"with the
inner core containing live virus and excipients and the outer tablet
layer consisting of cellulose and other ingredients.  Oral
administration of vaccine results in a self-limited, asymptomatic
infection in the gastrointestinal tract and produces protective
neutralizing antibodies in the serum.    This topic is intended to
enhance the manufacturing methods currently used in production
(or"tableting") of the licensed adenovirus vaccine.  The technology used
 to produce the tablets originates from the 1960s and its continued
long-term sustainability is of concern to DoD.  The proposed solution
should utilize novel technological methods and capitalize on advances in
 biotechnology and pharmaceutical production technologies.  The proposed
 novel method will be suitable for production of live adenovirus vaccine
 for oral administration to healthy individuals at risk of acquiring
adenovirusassociated acute respiratory disease.  The new method will
take advantage of reliable modern production methods; will be able to
achieve licensure by the FDA; will provide clear benefits compared to
current tableting methods, such as as facility and equipment
requirements, technical complexity, robustness, etc., and; will
ultimately yield vaccine that shares comparable virologic, safety, and
immunologic characteristics with the licensed vaccine.  Targets for
improvement may include, but are not restricted to drying,
stabilization, and enteric protection of live virus for oral delivery.
Ideally, the new vaccine will be reviewed by the FDA as"Biosimilar"to
the reference product, the Barr Adenovirus vaccine, permitting expedited
 clinical development.    PHASE I: Produce a conceptual design for
developing, manufacturing, and testing the proposed solution.  Produce a
 prototype vaccine of at least two Adenovirus types (e.g., types 4 and
7) for the purpose of demonstrating feasibility of the proposed
solution.  Production methods and vaccine ingredients are not expected
to be finalized at end of this phase; GMP product is not required.
Test(s) of feasibility may include modified disintegration and\/or
dissolution tests demonstrating the potential for pH-controlled release
of adequate amounts of live adenovirus.  Additional and\/or alternative
feasibility tests may be proposed.  DoD may provide small quantities of
the licensed vaccine for relevant non-human research conducted as part
of this phase.  Provide a comprehensive analysis of significant risks
associated with the proposal, including manufacturing, technical,
regulatory, cost, and performance.  Provide a comprehensive report of
all testing performed during this phase.    PHASE II: Produce vaccine
under GMP pilot production conditions, perform required nonclinical
studies (such as microbial burden), and conduct an 8-week FDA phase 1
trial in healthy adults of at least two adenovirus types (e.g., types 4
and 7).  Animal efficacy and reproductive toxicity studies are not
required.  Animal toxicology studies may be waived by the FDA, if the
product is deemed equivalent to the Barr vaccine.  The results of the
clinical trial will permit a clear comparison of the new and Barr
vaccines in terms of fecal shedding, absence of spread beyond the
gastrointestinal tract (i.e., no detectable vaccine virus in throat,
blood or urine), immune response, and preliminary safety.  Vaccine
shelf-life assessment will also be initiated during this phase.  DoD may
 provide limited quantities of licensed vaccine required for testing
proposed during this phase, including a clinical trial.  Provide a
comprehensive report of all testing performed during this phase,
including a complete searchable dataset of the clinical trial.    PHASE
III: The overall goal of this effort is to modernize the production of
vaccine tablets administered to all military basic recruits to prevent
febrile respiratory illness due to adenovirus types 4 and 7.  The
technological innovations utilized in the modern vaccine will also
permit more efficient development of new adenovirus vaccines comprised
of different adenovirus types, such as types 14 or 21, should they be
needed in the future by DoD.  Modernization of tableting methods will
also support commercialization of the product in other markets (e.g.,
South Korea and China have reported problems with adenovirus type 7) and
 derivative products.  For instance, oral adenoviruses may be very
useful and widely utilized for delivery of vaccine vectors for multiple
other pathogens, gene therapy, and cancer therapy.  The focus of this
phase should be on further development and validation of the methods and
 product with the objective of obtaining FDA approval of the new
vaccines with an indication for use in military personnel at risk of
acquiring adenovirus infections.",

        "topic_name": "Antibiotic Decision Support System for Management
 of Combat Casualties with Severe Infections",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop an antibiotic clinical
decision support (CDSS) system to improve treatment for critical care
patients with severe infections.  The system will provide
recommendations to critical care providers in the intensive care unit
(ICU) on antibiotic dosing based on multiple patient factors, including
weight, infection source, infectious agent, cultures, susceptibilities,
and prior treatments.  The final system will include the ability to be
configured to the unit"s specific antibiotic regiments, characteristics,
 and anti-biograms and will also integrate with hospital information
technology (IT) infrastructure.    DESCRIPTION: Many military casualties
 survive the first few days of burn and trauma resuscitation and
surgeries only to fall victim to an infection and sepsis.  Intensive
care for these casualties is complex, requires treatment of systemic and
 often multiple organ systems at a time and is highly error-prone.
Permanent morbidity or death results when the right care is not
delivered or is delivered too late.  Evidence-based best practices are
published, but yet not implemented in step by step detail at the bedside
 due to complexity.      Severe sepsis and septic shock have a mortality
 rate near 30% (1).  Recent data has shown that computer based clinical
decision support programs can greatly increase compliance with evidence
based best practices, resulting in a 50% reduction in mortality for
sepsis (2) and for initial empiric antibiotic therapy (3). Targeted
antibiotic therapy is important for effective treatment of the organism
and for avoiding highly toxic side effects of broad spectrum antibiotics
 and for avoiding increased pathogen resistance.  However, choice of
antibiotics often requires changing after susceptibility and cultures
results are received.  Burn casualties are particularly susceptible to
multiple incidents of sepsis over a prolonged hospital stay.  An
antibiotic CDSS system is needed to quickly process a myriad of factors
in determining the optimal antibiotic therapy for a patient at any given
 time throughout the hospital stay.  This system should take into
account not only empiric choice decisions but individualize dosages
based on minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) calculations.    PHASE
I: Develop an initial concept design and demonstrate elements of a CDSS
software program providing specific antibiotic therapy guidance from
initial diagnosis through discharge.  Contractors should provide a basic
 software application that demonstrates a basic ability to process and
make recommendations on potential antibiotic therapies. Contractors
should explore novel approaches to implement antibiotic decision making
as additional patient data is received.  The clinical decision support
system should include broad spectrum, narrow spectrum, and targeted
antibiotic therapy.  The CDSS system should provide new recommendations
when susceptibility and culture results are received.  The system should
 include MIC calculations.  The contractor will conceptualize a
graphical display showing the infection status and antibiotic therapy
from initial infection diagnosis to discharge.     PHASE II: The
contractor will further develop and demonstrate the CDSS and will
optimize bedside workflow.  The contractor will demonstrate input
clinical data IT integration with the hospital IT system for at least
one variable.  The contractor will develop and demonstrate a graphical
representation of infection status and antibiotic therapy from initial
infection diagnosis unto discharge. The successful clinical decision
support program will allow physicians to adjust antibiotic therapy and
will be easily adopted by the bedside caregivers.    PHASE III: The
contractor will produce a working CDSS system capable of updating
antibiotic decisions by the medical director of a unit.  The CDSS system
 should gather most of the input laboratory data through IT integration.
  The CDSS system should be configured so that multiple client
computers, tablets, or smartphone device can access the system
simultaneously.      The final CDSS system must include evidence-based
antibiotic therapy recommendations and an algorithm to optimize dosage
for patients based on MIC calculations.  Such a system could save lives
by providing evidence-based, individualized, optimized antibiotic
therapy for critical care patients throughout a hospital stay.  Such a
system should be of great commercial interest for all branches of the
U.S. armed services as well as civilian critical care professionals in
multiple critical care units.",

        "topic_name": "Portable Closed Loop Burn Resuscitation System to
 Optimize and Automate Fluid Resuscitation of Combat Casualties",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a portable closed loop burn
resuscitation system to improve treatment for serious burn patients.
The resuscitation system will provide optimized fluid therapy for a
patient based on patient attributes as well as patient response to
therapy.  The final system will automate many traditional caregiver
tasks so that a medic could operate the system with similar care
results.  The final system will also communicate complete resuscitation
data to a central location.    DESCRIPTION: Burns represent 5% of
overall casualties, but 10% of potentially survivable deaths.  Severely
burned patients require significant intravenous resuscitation, often
requiring 20 liters within a 24 hour period.  Burn fluid therapy carries
 the risk of severe complications or mortality resulting from
under-resuscitation (end stage organ failure) or over-resuscitation
(abdominal compartment syndrome).  Fluid therapy requires adjustment at
least hourly as the burn pathophysiology morphs during the resuscitation
 phase.    Casualty evacuations (CASEVACs) are also performed over
multiple hours and caregivers available in the deployed setting often
have limited training for and experience of burn care.  The result is
that many patients who arrive at definitive care facilities are often
over- or under- resuscitated.  Clinical care tasks that involve
significant cognitive workload, such as calculating an optimal fluid
resuscitation dose hourly, are prone to mistakes and subsequent patient
harm.  Labor intensive workload tasks also reduce the ability of a
caregiver to provide adequate care to multiple patients simultaneously
and makes logistical placement of highly trained personnel difficult.
The primary performance goal is to increase the average length of time
when the medic needs to perform a technical or care task with the
casualty.    Current approaches utilize patient urinary output response
as the primary feedback mechanism for adjusting fluid infusion rates;
however, urine output is not as useful or is not present in patients
with renal failure, high bladder pressure or other physiological
complications.    Patients do not always respond to crystalloid therapy.
  A patient may need a secondary therapy, such as albumin or pressors,
as an adjunct therapy.  The decision of when to begin adjunct therapy
and at what dosage is complex and difficult to optimize by guidelines or
 paper protocols.    Detailed records of the resuscitation process,
including how much of each fluid was given, and when, are often lost in
the CASEVAC process.  Multiple hand-offs from the forward surgical team
to the combat support hospital to the critical care air transport to
definitive care facilities results in lost records or missing data.  It
is important to not only retain the data, but to display the data
graphically and easily communicate the data to a central location.    A
resuscitation system that optimizes and automates fluid therapy,
includes an adjunct therapy for non-responders, includes a second
patient response mechanism, and that keeps and exports a complete record
 of the resuscitation process during CASEVAC will be of great value in
improving treatment for severely burned military personnel.    PHASE I:
Develop and demonstrate a prototype portable burn resuscitation system
which incorporates a least a urine monitoring device and an infusion
pump.  Conceptualize approaches to automating caregiver cognitive and
physical tasks, including approaches to optimizing crystalloid
resuscitation based on patient responses, to adjunct therapy decisions
and manual tasks.  The contractor will conceptualize a graphical display
 that shows input variables and therapy settings in a meaningful way to
caregivers.  The contractor will identify a method for communicating
data to a central location.    The contractor will identify clinical and
 technological issues that would require fully-automated care to
disengage and require medic intervention.  The contractor will create a
plan to test or simulate each issue to gather data on the Mean Time
Before Disengaging (MTBD) from fully-automated mode.  Furthermore, the
contractor will identify a method for determining the MTBD of the system
 as a whole based on the MTBD data of the individual issues.    PHASE
II: The contractor will further develop the burn resuscitation system.
The contractor will implement the best approaches from Phase I into
hardware and software that optimizes and automates crystalloid
resuscitation based on patient responses, provides an adjunct therapy,
displays graphically the patient response variables and therapy settings
 and reduces other cognitive and manual caregiver tasks. The contractor
will demonstrate data export into a central location.    Based on the
MTBD plans created in Phase I, the contractor will perform tests and
simulation studies and provide data on MTBD for each clinical and
technical issue, and then calculate the system MTBD.  The performance
goal will be an average MTBD of 45 minutes or longer for individual
issues and a system MTBD of 20 minutes or longer.    PHASE III: The
contractor will validate and produce a working portable burn
resuscitation system that optimizes and automates crystalloid fluid
resuscitation based on patient responses, will provide a therapy adjunct
 to crystalloid resuscitation, will graphically display patient
responses and therapies over the resuscitation phase and will
communicate data to a central location.  The burn resuscitation system
will have a MTBD of 20 minutes or longer.    The final burn
resuscitation system will optimize fluid therapy for patients, will
identify and provide a second therapy for patients when crystalloid
resuscitation is not adequately effective, and, importantly, will
automate care with the primary goal of reducing required frequency of
caregiver interactions with the patient.  Such a system will optimize
care, will enable lesser trained caregivers to provide adequate care of
patients, and will enable caregivers to effectively take care of more
patients simultaneously.  Such a system should save lives, improve the
quality of life for military and civilian patients, improve the CASEVAC
process and should be of great commercial interest for all branches of
the U.S. armed services and civilian burn care professionals.
Validation of the system will be performed in accordance with FDA
regulation related to development and validation of a closed loop
medical device.  The contractor will submit the developed system for FDA
 clearance for eventual use in a clinical environment.",

        "topic_name": "Development of Biocompatible Dressings for the
Delivery of Analgesics to Burn Wounds",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a biocompatible dressing
material for the controlled delivery of analgesic drugs to burn wounds.
   DESCRIPTION: Thousands of U.S. military personnel have suffered
serious burn wounds and other injuries during Operations Iraqi Freedom
(OIF) and Enduring Freedom (OEF), where burns have been identified as
the primary cause of injury in 5% of all military personnel evacuated
from those battlefields (1-2). Uncontrolled acute burn pain contributes
to several sensory abnormalities including development of chronic pain
(3-4). Burn patients report intense pain during procedures such as wound
 debridement, dressing changes and strenuous physical and occupational
therapy. In fact procedural pain is the most common grievance reported
by the burn population (5). Management of the intense pain that
accompanies burn wounds relies heavily on systemically administered
opioids, which produce many side effects including tolerance,
hyperalgesia, hemodynamic instability, respiratory depression, and
dependence (4). There is therefore a need to reduce quantities of opioid
 analgesics administered to burn patients. This need could be met
through development of a topical analgesic wound dressing for severe
combat-associated burn injuries that would reduce or eliminate the need
for systemic treatment with opioids. Such dressings would also serve to
protect the wound from infection and thereby aid in wound healing. This
request addresses one of the new USAMRMC SBIR topics for FY14, which
falls within the goals of the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine
Research Program: Novel pharmaceutical approaches to alleviate the
development of tolerance and physical dependence of opioids without
diminishing opioids"analgesic effects.     To further accelerate
healing, active wound dressings have been developed that provide
controlled local delivery of therapeutic agents, such as biological
growth factors and antimicrobial agents, while keeping the wound surface
 moist, removing exudates, inhibiting bacterial invasion and allowing
oxygen permeation.  Active wound dressings would ideally maintain the
local drug concentration at a constant optimum therapeutic dosage level
from the moment of initial application until complete wound healing is
achieved (i.e., zero-order kinetics).  To be suitable for topical
application to burns, the composite wound dressing materials must also
be carefully selected for biocompatibility, mechanical strength and
surface adhesion, and resistance to bacterial invasion so that
clinicians can readily apply and remove them at appropriate times during
 therapy. Eventually the development of wound dressings that deliver
combinations of analgesics and antimicrobials is planned.    PHASE I:
Identify and define a biocompatible material which can provide the
controlled delivery of analgesic drugs. This material must be adaptable
to a wound dressing format. Required Phase I deliverables will include
determination of technical feasibility using appropriate in-vitro, and
if possible in-vivo assays. Such assays would demonstrate the ability of
 a prototype material to act as a stable, biologically compatible depot
for one or more of the opioid analgesics (morphine, methadone, fentanyl,
 meperidine, oxycodone), or other mainstay analgesics (ketamine,
gabapentin) currently used for treatment of burn wounds in the military
population.  In addition, demonstration of relevant physical properties
of the material, such as mechanical strength, surface adhesion,
resistance to bacterial invasion, and capacity for controlled release of
 analgesics (including release kinetics), is expected. In addition, once
 proof of feasibility is achieved, applicants are required to provide
specific plans for how they will test the material in a validated animal
 pain model in Phase II. No human testing will be proposed for the Phase
 I (6 month) period. Although the period of time is short, it is
preferred that an animal model be used for some part of the feasibility
studies in Phase I.    PHASE II: The proposed study should demonstrate
and validate the efficacy of the material tested in Phase I for pain
control in an in-vivo model that replicates burn injury induced pain.
The safety of the material in combination with one or more of analgesics
 listed above must be demonstrated with respect to biocompatibility,
toxicity and immunogenicity.  The ideal material would have physical
properties allowing it to conform to any burn wound surface. This
includes liquids, gels, bandages and other dry materials that upon wound
 contact would conform to the complex topography of the wound bed.
Phase II deliverables will include development, testing and
demonstration of a prototype analgesic wound dressing composed of the
material in combination with one or more of the above listed analgesics.
 The product should be self-administrable in the field and take effect
within minutes of application.  In addition, the product should be
easily removed (i.e. dressing changed) without causing damage to the
wound bed or left in place (i.e. biodegradable). The product also needs
to be shelf stable for long periods of time at all likely temperatures
experienced in austere combat environments.  All these requirements must
 be demonstrated during the Phase II period.    PHASE III: In this phase
 it is expected that all pre-clinical testing and validation of the
Phase II prototype product(s) will be finalized.  Phase III will
primarily consist of clinical trials designed to test the safety and
efficacy of the Phase II product(s) in burn pain control. The focus of
these trials will be on testing for combat-related wound care and\/or
civilian wound care that is similar to combat wounds. Phase III efforts
will be directed towards technology transfer, preferably
commercialization, of the product(s) from Phase II.  This will include
application for FDA approval. Commercialization efforts will include GMP
 manufacturing of sufficient materials for evaluation.  The small
business should have plans to secure funding from non-SBIR government
sources and \/or the private sector to develop or transition the
prototypes into a viable product(s) for sale to the military and\/or
private sector markets. The end-state of this research will be the full
development of one or more products consisting of biocompatible wound
dressings that deliver sustained pain control, which can be used
effectively in austere combat environments.  Such products are also
expected to have utility extending beyond the combat environment, into
civilian burn wound care and emergency medicine applications.",

        "topic_name": "Diagnostic Device for Norovirus Gastroenteritis",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate a prototype diagnostic
test for gastroenteritis caused by Norovirus infection. The technology
shall be able to detect infection at the onset of symptoms, be able to
test unprocessed samples, incorporate all necessary controls, be
compatible with use in an austere environment (small, lightweight, and
insensitive to environmental extremes), and provide users with automated
 results interpretation.    DESCRIPTION: Infectious diseases can have a
significant impact on the operational readiness of military forces. The
military has a requirement for innovative technologies to diagnose
patients at or near the point of care or point of need to improve
clinical outcome and conserve resources. Due to the operational
environment, patients seen at the military equivalent of an outpatient
clinic (doctrinally termed Role of Care 1 or 2) must be quickly treated
and returned to duty or evacuated to a more capable medical unit (Role
of Care 3). Therefore, diagnosis on the day of symptom onset is
essential. In military settings, the point of need is frequently an
austere environment without, for example, access to typical laboratory
infrastructure, reliable electric power, refrigeration or controlled
room-temperature storage, or specially trained laboratory personnel.
Therefore, the proposed solution should be small, lightweight, and
insensitive to environmental extremes such as dust, high humidity, and
storage temperatures of up to 45degreesC. If electric power is required,
 it should be provided by rechargeable or disposable commercially
available batteries. The use of lithium-ion batteries is discouraged due
 to restrictions on their shipment by air. The proposed solution should
test unprocessed clinical samples and provide easily interpretable
results. A single test should be complete (sample to answer) within 60
minutes, and the proposed solution should be able to test 20 patient
samples in four hours. The device should be designed to minimize the
risk of contamination and resulting false positive or false negative
results. The proposed technology and approach should be consistent with
obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance as a
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-waived diagnostic device
allowing use outside a CLIA-regulated laboratory (e.g., a doctor"s
office), or, in the military, use by non-laboratory personnel (e.g.,
medic or independent duty corpsman) when prescribed by a physician. The
Army is not planning to field current and future US military polymerase
chain reaction diagnostic devices (the Joint Biological Agent
Identification and Diagnostic System and the Next Generation Diagnostic
Systems Increment 1) at Army Role of Care 1 or 2, so development of
assays for these systems is not consistent with the objective of this
Topic.    This effort is also intended to demonstrate the ability to
develop rapidly diagnostic tests for novel diseases. If an analyzer
component is proposed, it should be designed so that the system can be
easily upgraded by the user to incorporate additional tests. Proposed
solutions that utilize synthetic or molecular biology approaches and
simplified manufacturing requirements are desired.     Noroviruses are
the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis. Most human cases of
Norovirus gastroenteritis are caused by viruses in genogroups II and I.
Norovirus genogroup IV may also cause human illness. The clinical
symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps.
Norovirus infection is readily communicable between individuals sharing
close quarters such as military camps and bases, cruise ships, and naval
 vessels. Transmission is most frequently through the consumption of
contaminated food and person-to-person contact. Asymptomatic viral
shedding for two or more weeks may complicate outbreak control.    There
 is only one FDA-cleared diagnostic device for Norovirus (FDA,
http:\/\/www.accessdata.fda.gov\/scripts\/cdrh\/devicesatfda\/index.cfm),
 and it is not cleared for the diagnosis of individual patients but only
 as an aid in investigating the cause of acute gastroenteritis
outbreaks. Further, the technology used (Enzyme Immunoassay) is not
compatible with use in the military equivalent of an outpatient clinic.
   The U.S. Department of Defense is seeking innovative materiel
solutions to provide a deployable, rapid, easy to use capability to
diagnose Norovirus infection. Development of an FDA-cleared diagnostic
device is not contemplated within the scope of Phases I or II of this
effort.     PHASE I: Specific Aim 1: If an analyzer device is required
by the technical approach proposed by the Offeror, demonstrate a
breadboard prototype of such a device in conjunction with the reagents
developed as part of Specific Aim 2.    Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate the
development of reagents (compatible with the prototype device under
Specific Aim 1) capable of detecting Norovirus genogroup II viruses (or
appropriate simulant) in clinically relevant sample matrix. Deliver a
report describing the design of the reagents and initial assay
performance data, if available.    PHASE II: Specific Aim 3: Based on
the Phase I prototype device and development feasibility report, produce
 a pre-production prototype demonstrating potential military utility.
Deliver the pre-production prototype for DoD laboratory evaluation.
Deliver a report describing the design and operation of the
pre-production prototype device.    Specific Aim 4: Further develop the
Norovirus genogroup II analyte-specific reagents to include the ability
to detect genogroup I (minimum) and genogroup IV (objective). Deliver a
report documenting the performance of the reagents. Deliver sufficient
quantities of reagents to allow the DoD to perform 50 tests during a DoD
 in-house laboratory evaluation.    PHASE III: By the end of Phase III,

        "topic_name": "Novel Imaging Agents for Tauopathies Associated
with Brain Injury",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Identify, design, synthesize and
characterize PET\/SPECT radiotracers for imaging of tauopathies.
Tauopathies are associated with abnormally phosphorylated or folded Tau
protein in response to TBI or concussion. Small molecules which bind
pathological Tau species are sought.    DESCRIPTION:  Traumatic Brain
Injury (TBI) is a suspected risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases
such as Alzheimer"s (1) and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathies (CTEs)
(2). CTEs are associated with concussion\/sports injuries. Single Photon
 Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) or Positron Emission Tomography
(PET) radiotracers are under consideration for routine use in the clinic
 for diagnosing neurodegenerative disease. Indeed, the PET imaging
agent, Fluorbetapir (Amyvid) is now FDA approved for assessing brain
neuritic plaques (3) for Alzheimer"s disease. Until Fluorbetapir was
approved, confirmation of molecular-level neurodegenerative change in
the clinic was limited to a handful of agents or autopsy. Of these
agents, none of them are intended to assay specific changes related to
TBI. Based on reports which link Tau protein with TBIs and CTEs (4),
this topic seeks proposals that will develop small molecules that
specifically bind Tau or its pathogenic species.     It is anticipated
that Phase I will encompass the identification, design, synthesis and
characterization of candidate molecules for Tau binding. Successful
proposals will identify a specified tau pathological target in the
proposal. Candidate molecules may be identified via literature, but a
sound plan demonstrating how the agent would be synthesized,
characterized and radiolabeled must be included as part of the proposal.
 Phase II should provide validation of the lead agent (e.g. Phase I
Clinical Trials) ahead of FDA approval and commercialization.     The
successful candidate agent could be used to 1) detect and diagnose
tauopathies at their earliest stages, 2) monitor treatment\/injury, 3)
aid researchers in distinguishing the differences between neurological
disease and injury. Proposals should indicate how the marker will impact
 1 or more of these research goals.    PHASE I: Proposals should contain
 a rationale for the appropriateness of the lead compound. The proposal
should also describe the synthetic chemistry strategy (or equivalent),
and provide a plan for radiolabeling the compound(s). It is expected
that at the end of Phase I, several candidate radiolabeled agents will
be made available for phase 2 funding under an approved IND. A
structural validation strategy using analytical chemistry methods (e.g.
NMR, UV\/VIS, Mass Spectrometry) should be included. No animal\/human
research will be done as part of Phase I.    PHASE II: Phase II funding
is expected to characterize several candidate radiolabeled agents in
pre-clinical and\/or Phase I human studies. The characterization work
will validate any lead agent(s) for Phase III SBIR research. Evidence
that GMP\/GLP manufacturing practices will be enforced should be
included as part of the proposal. Studies into the distribution,
metabolism and pharmacokinetics of these agents are encouraged, along
with a robust plan for assessing safety and efficacy as part of the
workplan. The Phase II plan should also include a plan for
commercialization and FDA approval. Suggested elements of the proposal
narrative concerning commercialization include considering and detailing
 the anticipated costs and design of Phase II\/III Clinical Trials. The
Phase II\/III Clinical Trials should feature robust neurological
endpoints which would illustrate the efficacy of these agents.    PHASE
III:   Sports Injuries, Alzheimer"s disease, and TBIs share tauopathies
as a common pathological feature. There is an absence of reliable,
quantifiable, non-invasive markers for Tau. This marker could be used to
 1) detect and diagnose tauopathies at their earliest stages, 2) monitor
 treatment\/injury, and 3) aid researchers in distinguishing the
differences between neurological disease and brain injury. For example, a
 marker such as this may help in making determinations regarding return
to duty (or the practice field) for individuals that have suffered from
concussions. Other imaging strategies such as CT and MRI do not
currently provide the functional resolution to assess brain injuries
over time. SPECT\/CT agents are uniquely positioned to longitudinally
study brain injuries and response to therapies because they require a
chemical tracer to specifically bind to pathological species in the
brain. This research could have a large impact on how we understand,
diagnose and treat concussion, both domestically and within the
military.",

        "topic_name": "Secure Wireless Communications for Enroute Combat
 Casualty Care",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this topic is to
develop and demonstrate a secure wireless communications capability and
developer"s implementation toolkit that can be installed on any handheld
 ruggedized SMART phone or tablet in order connect the devices with
wireless medical sensors and secure military communication networks.
This research will incrementally advance the state of the art in enroute
 combat casualty care assessment, monitoring, and intervention at point
of injury (POI) and on  attended casualty evacuation vehicles such that
the final demonstration shows proof-of-concept feasibility for secure
proximal and remote wireless patient monitoring, encounter
documentation, medical information exchange and telementoring from any
location on the battlefield.     DESCRIPTION: This topic is designed to
focus and address the current gap in availability of secure close range
broad band communications needed to  implement a wide-range of
potentially hands-free wireless capabilities for medical monitoring and
intervention; information capture, storage and security; and
communications integration with both civilian and sensitive but
unclassified military networks.  It is now technically possible and
operationally feasible to combine most of the physiological monitoring,
medical information exchange, imaging, and telemedicine technologies
already in use, undergoing evaluation, or still in development; with
emerging semi-autonomous, autonomous, or closed-loop treatment and
intervention systems.  This topic focuses down to prototyping a wireless
 transmission capability and developer"s toolkit that could potentially
be used on any mobile device, wireless physiological or telemetry
sensor, or network access point vehicle to enable secure wireless
communications among devices.  Using the toolkit, the wireless
communications application could be installed on a SMART phone, tablet,
physiological sensor, and\/or network access point by an application
developer in order to facilitate development and implementation of far
forward combat casualty care applications that:  1) enable transfer of
medical data from medical sensors via secure wireless transmission modes
 (e.g. Ultra wideband, Secure Bluetooth, Ultraviolet communication,
etc.)  to enable medics, remote providers or even closed loop patient
support systems to  monitor patients at POI, while enroute via air or
ground evacuation, or at forward medical treatment facilities such as
battalion aid stations; 2) interface to secure tactical radios and
tactical cellular mesh networks on the battlefield to enable
tele-operated,  semi-autonomous  or autonomous operation, and command
and control on the move; 3) record and transmit"store and
forward"electronic patient encounter documentation such as the
electronic Tactical Combat Casualty Care (eTCCC) Card; and 4) enable
secure two-way wireless imaging and video information exchange and
telementoring.      After Phase III development, the final production
model of the secure wireless capability must be ruggedized for shock,
dust, sand, and water resistance to enable reliable, uninterrupted
operation in combat vehicles on the move, to include operation and
storage at extreme temperatures, and the developer"s kit must be able to
 install this capability on the devices.  Size and weight are important
factors; the ultimate object of system would be secure wireless
connections between patient continuous medical monitoring sensors and
military tactical radios to a handheld integrated processor, display,
and communications device that is powerful enough to run"Predictive
Algorithms".  A wireless device"chip"and antenna that can be easily
installed using the developer"s kit into a mobile phone or tablet sized
device that a soldier\/medic can carry in a uniform pocket would be
ideal.  Quantitative values for acceptable operational and storage
temperatures and power requirements should be planned to comply with
applicable MIL-SPECs (available on line).  To facilitate
commercialization, the developer"s kit should enable embedding the
secure wireless capability within medical sensors, mobile smart phone
devices, military common-user tactical radios, and\/or ubiquitous
civilian communications equivalents.    PHASE I: Research solutions for
technical challenges on this topic as identified above for a capability
that incorporates feasible solution for a wireless transmission
capability and developer"s toolkit that could potentially be used on any
 mobile smart phone type device, wireless physiological or telemetry
sensor, or network access point vehicle to enable secure wireless
communications among devices via secure wireless transmission modes
(e.g. Ultra wideband, Secure Bluetooth, Ultraviolet communication,
etc.).  Flesh out commercialization plans that were developed in the
Phase I proposal for elaboration or modification to be incorporated in
the Phase II proposal.  Explore commercialization potential with
civilian emergency medical service systems development and manufacturing
 companies.  Seek partnerships within government and private industry
for transition and commercialization of the production version of the
product.    PHASE II: From the Phase I design, develop a ruggedized
prototype a wireless transmission capability and developer"s toolkit
that could potentially be used on any mobile Smart Phone type device,
wireless physiological or telemetry sensor, or network access point
vehicle to enable secure wireless communications among devices via
secure wireless transmission modes (e.g. Ultra wideband, Secure
Bluetooth, Ultraviolet communication, etc.).    In addition to
demonstrating secure wireless connectivity to mobile Smart Phones,
medical monitors and military tactical radios; the prototype device
should demonstrate communications to ubiquitous civilian broadband
wireless communications networks.   Demonstrate the system with soldier
medical attendants in a relevant environment; such as at a USA Army
TRADOC Battle Lab.  Flesh out commercialization plans contained in the
Phase II proposal for elaboration or modification in Phase III.  Firm up
 collaborative relationships and establish agreements with military and
civilian end users to conduct proof-of-concept evaluations in Phase III.
  Begin to execute transition to Phase III commercialization potential
in accordance with the Phase II commercialization plan.     PHASE III:
Refine and execute the commercialization plan included in the Phase II
Proposal.  Execute proof-of-concept evaluation in a suitable operational
 environment (e.g. Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD), Joint
Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD), Marine Corps Limited
Objective Experiment (LOE), Army Network Integration Exercise (NIE),
etc.).  Present the prototype project, as a candidate for fielding, to
applicable Army, Navy\/Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, Department
of Defense, Program Managers for Combat Casualty Care systems along with
 government and civilian program managers for emergency, remote, and

        "topic_name": "Ultra Low-Power System on a Chip (SoC) for
Physiological Status Monitoring (PSM)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate an ultra-low power
multi-node ambulatory physiological monitoring system where a System on a
 Chip (SoC) senses, processes, and communicates health state information
 to a standard Android smart platform.     DESCRIPTION:
Commercially-available medical-grade wearable physiological status
monitoring (PSM) devices (e.g., www.equivital.co.uk,
www.zephyr-technology.com) are currently being used to (a) understand
and improve the health and well-being of soldiers, and (b) collect
quantitative data to guide improvements to the clothing and individual
equipment that soldiers wear and use.  For example, PSM systems are
being used to assess the thermal-work strain imposed by training and
deployment to harsh environments, and to document the physiological
impact of wearing protective clothing ensembles.      Currently
available PSM systems are well-suited to these focused R &amp; D
applications where test durations are limited to a few days at most, and
 the system size, weight, power, and cost of current PSM systems can be
tolerated.  However, efforts to transition these legacy systems into
routine use by military personnel to support tactical decision making
(e.g., how much water do I need?  When should I take a rest break? Who
is most at risk of overheating?) is not yet practical.  Current systems
suffer from excessive size, weight, power requirements, cost, and use of
 proprietary technology that restricts the use of 3rd party sensors and
algorithms, and a lack of a viable on-body low power short-range (2-5
m), low signature, low data rate, body area network data communication
capabilities.   To be successful a body area network data typically
needs to be low-bandwidth, low-power, short-range, and have a minimal
electromagnetic signature.     Future broad use of PSM systems requires
wear-and-forget technologies that can be used routinely for extended
periods of time without recharging or replacing batteries.  PSM systems
of this type could be used to facilitate physical training , avoiding
overtraining and musculo-skeletal injuries, host individualized models
that facilitate mission and logistical planning (e.g., anticipate work
rates and water and ration requirements), mission support, after action
reviews, model validation &amp; verification, model individualization,
mission planning and tailored logistical support).  An example of a high
 value application of next-generation SoC PSM systems is to promote the
physical and mental fitness of soldiers and their family members through
 Activity, Nutrition, and Sleep Management (ANS)
http:\/\/www.armymedicine.army.mil\/assets\/home\/Army_Medicine_2020_Strategy.pdf.
    Towards this end, the Army is interested in promoting the
development and maturation of integrated next-generation
open-architected SoC PSM solutions.  The deliverable would be a
Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 validation of the SoC PSM system
demonstration and validation in a laboratory environment that includes
(a) collection and processing of one or more physiological signals at a
given node, (b) wireless transmission of collected data from one node to
 the SoC node serving as a gateway to an Android smart platform, and
documentation of (c) ultra-low power requirements and (d) the
reliability and validity of the data stream(s).     PHASE I: Building on
 the baseline capabilities of relevant extant SoC PSM systems, design a
practical plan for achieving (a) the desired hardware, firmware, network
 communication, and data display capabilities of the envisioned
multi-node SoC PSM demonstration system described above, (b) and
establish a plan for SoC PSM system test, evaluation and validation.  No
 research or testing involving animal or human subjects will be needed.
     PHASE II: Using the Phase I plans, and building on existing SoC
capabilities: develop, demonstrate and validate an ultra-low power,
multi-node, miniaturized SoC PSM system capable of sensing, processing,
and communicating individual physiological information to a smart
Android platform for display.     The SoC PSM system will (a)
incorporate an ECG sensor (required) and incorporate other on-chip
sensor types (e.g., skin temperature, accelerometry for activity and
posture detection) (desired) and be able to link to off-chip sensors
(e.g., photoplethysmography\/oximetry) (desired); (b) have a processor
capable of signal processing and data management (required), and
execution of simple algorithms (desired), (c) have ultra-low power
requirements (total power SoC power",

Module Payload for Casualty Extraction",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: This project will develop and
demonstrate an innovative and novel medical module payload for the
Squad-Multipurpose Equipment Transport (S-MET) unmanned ground vehicle
(UGS), enabling the S-MET to extract a combat casualty and perform medic
 attended CASEVAC.      DESCRIPTION:  Combat Medics and Marine Corpsmen
routinely put themselves at risk to get to, and extract wounded, and in
doing so often become casualties themselves. The military medical
community is leveraging the robotics\/UGS development work ongoing at
the U.S. Army Maneuver Center of Excellence and elsewhere in DoD to
provide improved and new capabilities for front line medical personnel
to improve their capabilities and reduce risk.     S-MET Medical Module
Payload Performance Goals: One of the key secondary uses of the S-MET is
 to provide non-autonomous casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) capability to
the small unit. The ability to re-configure vehicles to is critical
during CASEVAC operations. Ultimately, the task of clearing the wounded
from the battle space is the responsibility of the maneuver Commander.
The CASEVAC capabilities within a formation are maneuver enablers for
that Commander. Their efficacy is gauged by the unit's ability to
perform this task, which is directly tied to overall mobility of the
formation. The S-MET must have tie down points and will be
re-configurable to accommodate and litter(s), providing full body access
 without any internal interference or displacement of crew or
passengers. The S-MET must also be capable of carrying at least two
Medical Equipment Sets, (Combat Lifesaver This topic will develop an
S-MET MMP, which when integrated with the S-MET unmanned ground vehicle
(UGV), will allow a combat lifesaver (infantryman with additional
medical training) or a medic to use the vehicle to safely and
expeditiously extract and move a casualty to a Casualty Collection
Point, or a Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) Point.     Desired
characteristics:   1. Integrated module and S-MET vehicle capable of
approaching an identified casualty, and extracting and moving the
casualty with combat lifesaver or medic attendant assistance.   2.
Separate module that can be installed and removed from the S-MET
platform quickly (less than 10 minutes) and easily.   3. Module doesn't
impact S-MET performance (e.g., speed, maneuverability) 4. Integrated
medic\/combat lifesaver assist module and S-MET vehicle should be as
fast as a human performing the same extraction &amp; CASEVAC task.   5.
Module should be safe - for the casualty (i.e., no additional harm) and
for other personnel in the area.   6. Module is teleoperated and\/or
semi-autonomous for some tasks (end goal is for an semi-autonomous
system with human-in-the-loop for safety). Patient will be attended
during CASEVAC operation.     A key goal of this research topic is to
leverage and demonstrate the novel capabilities of 3-D printing to speed
 design and development, reduce prototyping costs, reduce production
costs, and reduce maintenance and repair costs, as well reducing
required spare parts inventories. Use of 3-D printing capability should
be used when it makes sense (e.g., to accelerate an iterative design,
development and test approach; and to reduce part fabrication costs).
  PHASE I: The Principle Investigator (PI) will research S-MET
documentation (when available for public release) applicable to this
research topic. The team will also research and analyze the
bio-mechanics of lifting and carrying, or dragging a casualty
(see"Research Involving Animal or Human Subjects,"section, below, - No
Human Use during Phase I, therefore the use of modeling and simulation
(M &amp; S) is strongly encouraged). However, Human Use Protocol
planning and documentation should be initiated, as required. The PI will
 develop and deliver a prototype medical mission payload module design
(see Description section, above). The PI will develop and demonstrate as
 much of the prototype design functionality as possible using M &amp; S
and'brass board'components. Finally, a draft Commercialization Plan will
 be developed.     Phase I Deliverables:   1. Report cataloging and
summarizing all S-MET and other documentation researched and used to
develop the medical mission module payload.   2. Report describing the
bio-mechanics of lifting, dragging and carrying a 300 lb casualty and
the impact thereof, on medical MMP functionality and design.   3.
Modeling and Simulation Plan, if any, for Phase I, with links to any
envisioned Phase II M &amp; S Plan.   4. Initial medical MMP prototype
design.   5. Demonstration of any M &amp; S tools developed or in
development, as well as any'brass board'components.   6. Report
detailing Human Use Protocol planning and documentation.   7. Draft
Commercialization Plan.   8. Report describing the planned use of 3-D
printing technology.     PHASE II: The PI will leverage the Phase I work
 and refine the medical MMP design. A working prototype shall be built
and demonstrated in the laboratory (minimum), and in a more relevant
outside environment (desired), using a robotic system or UGV (S-MET
vehicle desired, but if not available a surrogate UGV may be used).
Technology Readiness Level desired at the end of Phase II is TRL-5. The
Phase I Commercialization Plan will be completed.     Phase II
Deliverables:   1. Prototype medical MMP demonstration in both a
laboratory and field environment.   2. Technical reports containing each
 demonstration's results.   3. Updated medical MMP design.   4. Develop,
 implement and document any Human Use Protocols plans and schedule, as
required.   5. Demonstration and documentation (report and software) of
any M &amp; S tools employed in this Phase II effort.   6. Updated
Commercialization Plan, including targeted (or ideally, acquired)
commercial or academic partners for Phase III.   7. Report describing
the use of 3-D printing and lessons learned.     PHASE III: 1. Technical
 and programmatic reports and plans, and technical and operational
demonstrations supporting further medical MMP development and
commercialization.   2. Updated and optimized medical MMP design.   3.
Updated or new Human Use Protocols developed, approved and executed.
4. Operational demonstration of the medical MMP integrated with a S-MET
vehicle or UGV surrogate, if no S-MET platform is available.   5. Report
 describing the use of 3-D printing and lessons learned.     The dual
use applications for a robotic\/UGV system medical mission payload

        "topic_name": "Mobile Military CO2 Refrigeration",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop technology to enable mobile,
 military, containerized cold-storage assets that use carbon-dioxide as
the refrigerant, for purposes of eliminating reliance on the more
heavily regulated and expensive refrigerants currently used.
DESCRIPTION:  The result of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and
hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) regulation in the 1990's was that road
and rail transport refrigeration systems today use hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs) instead as their refrigerants.  This includes all our military's
existing and near-term mobile cold-storage assets.  The issue is that
HFCs are now under threat.  In 2006, through the Kyoto Protocol, the
international community, including the United States, came to an
agreement that HFCs must eventually be phased out to help slow global
climate change, because HFCs have a global warming potential (GWP) more
than a thousand times greater than carbon-dioxide (CO2) .  The first
milestone -- phase-out of HFCs from automobiles in Europe beginning
January 1, 2013 -- has passed.  The next targets are supermarket and
industrial refrigeration, then building air-conditioning, followed by
road and rail container transport refrigerator\/freezers, and domestic
appliances.  This trend has inspired Product Manager - Force Sustainment
 Systems (PM-FSS) and the Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM) to
ensure the Army is not disadvantaged by such regulation.  The Army is
therefore seeking advanced development of technologies that enable
mobile military containerized cold-storage assets that use alternative
refrigerants, namely CO2.     Several major corporations initiated
development ahead of the upcoming ban.  Having concerns that ammonia,
hydrocarbons, and the current hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) are not suitable
 replacement candidates due to flammability and toxicity issues,
researchers are investing in CO2 solutions.  CO2 refrigeration is not
new, but the need to eliminate refrigerants with high GWP, the necessity
 for greater efficiency to decrease energy consumption, and a desire for
 far lower refrigerant costs, is driving innovation.  It is supported by
 recent advances in materials, processor-based electronic controls, and
the advancement of computer-aided analysis tools and techniques, which
in turn impact the designs of heat exchangers, compressors and other
components, and enhance control over the process.  The issues with CO2
refrigeration -- high pressures and\/or increased component counts --
now appear to be surmountable with the emergence of these new
technologies.  Furthermore, the inherently high process pressures result
 in higher fluid densities, meaning reductions in weight and size are
also possible -- given the same power requirements -- for various
components including the compressor.      The majority of work thus far
has focused on vending machines (Danfoss and the Coca-Cola Co.),
supermarkets (Hillphoenix, Hannaford Bros. and Sobey's), and recently
Carrier has been developing for containerized transport refrigeration.
While Carrier's containerized system is the closest to what we need, it
is designed only for ordinary road, rail and ship transport conditions,
not military application.  And it is still in development, so commercial
 acquisition is not possible.  As such, military investment is
necessary.  While small businesses may be able to leverage some of
Carrier's technology, additional innovative development will address the
 fact that military assets require ruggedization for off-road transport,
 efficiency gains to minimize logistical burden, modification to power
consumption levels to accommodate use with camp grids and gensets, the
need for dual evaporators, compactness to create space for the inclusion
 of onboard gensets and fuel tanks, and adaptation to extremely hot
environments  - areas of deficiency in the Carrier unit.    Concepts
should target modular refrigeration units (RU) suitable to large
containerized cold-storage.  The weight objective for a system capable
of cooling a 20'ISO container is",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a technique or system to
rapidly determine the impact of deviations from established shade
performance specifications on the camouflage effectiveness of Soldier
uniforms in a photorealistic and radiometrically correct manner.
DESCRIPTION: This SBIR seeks innovative approaches to visualize and
quantify the impact on camouflage effectiveness of materials determined
to be"off spec"by various amounts for shade and near-infrared (NIR) both
 upon initial submission and after completion of various performance
tests, such as colorfastness to light and laundering or durability
(wear).   As an example, current specifications for printed camouflage
fabric for combat uniforms (e.g., MIL-DTL-44436A, Cloth, Camouflage
Pattern, Wind Resistant Poplin, Nylon\/Cotton Blend) require visual
evaluation by a trained color specialist of the submitted specimen
against the established standard under standard lighting conditions,
D75, in a shade booth.  The visual appearance of the specimen is
compared to a set of physical standard and tolerance samples pulled from
 production runs by a team of subject matter experts. The near-infrared
performance is evaluated based on spectrophotometer measurements of each
 color in wavelengths between 600-860nm and how they compare to the
established tolerances in the current specification for that pattern.
  When specimens are judged to be outside of the acceptable range, a
waiver may be granted if it is determined to be in the best interest of
the US Government by subject matter experts and contracting personnel.
However, there is currently no method to visualize, in a photorealistic
and radiometrically correct process, what the appearance of these
deviations is or to quantitatively evaluate the impact of the waived
specimens on the overall performance of the camouflage in a combat
environment without actually fabricating prototypes from the material in
 question and conducting a field test.  For instance, due to both the
complexity of the camouflage patterns and the sensitivity of the human
visual system, a small deviation in one color may have a minimal impact
on a pattern"s visual and\/or NIR performance while a change of a
similar magnitude in another color of the same pattern could have a
profound impact.      The goal for this task is to design, develop and
demonstrate an innovative technique or techniques for rapidly
visualizing and quantitatively determining the impact of the off-spec
performance of Soldier Camouflage materials in relevant, real-world
background scenes in the visual and near-infrared regions of the
spectrum.    PHASE I: Design, develop and demonstrate a system process
for creating photorealistic and radiometrically correct visualizations
of off spec material for comparison to standard material performance at a
 minimum of 3 ranges (background dependent close, far and mid-ranges) of
 military relevance.  Metrics to quantify time to generate
visualizations, end product accuracy and fidelity will be chosen or
developed by the contractor.  An actual world location will be selected
to encompass typical background elements relevant to evaluating material
 conformance to specification requirements.     PHASE II: Develop a
prototype demonstration system for generating photorealistic and
radiometrically correct visualizations of Soldier camouflage materials
for comparison to standard materials in the visual and NIR that is
extendable to other spectral regions, as well as a means to quantify the
 performance impact of the deviation.  The software architecture and
system operational requirements will be clearly stated and compatible
with existing Army tool suites.  Comparisons of the generated
visualizations will be conducted against actual physical samples of
standard and off spec material(s) and evaluated for scene generation
speed, complexity and accuracy.  Specimen and scene preparation and
evaluation time shall be determined and documented.    PHASE III: Scene
simulations are used in many current DoD applications, such as missile
development, algorithm development and intelligence gathering, as well
as in the motion picture and computer gaming industries.  Our goal is to
 have a simpler version of a background and target scene generator than
the hyperspectral variants required for sensor or missile development,
suitable for use during full scale procurement.  However, a more robust,
 radiometrically correct version than the photorealistic renderers used
in the entertainment industry is required.  Additional applications of
this work could include extending the visualization software to other
spectral regions beyond the NIR for other military products.     PHASE
III DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: This visualization process could also aid
customers in the commercial market by demonstrating the impact of
varying shade tolerances to find the best combination of appearance,
durability and cost. This could be useful in many different markets
including textiles, paints and plastics,  food and brand marketing.  An
additional application could be in the evaluation of transportation
safety regulations.",

        "topic_name": "Technology to Support Non-destructive Inspection
of Helicopter Sling Load (HSL) Slings and Textiles",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a technology to
non-destructively inspect and test helicopter sling load slings to
standards in TM 4-48.09 and FM 3-55.93    DESCRIPTION: Helicopter slings
 are textiles used to attach a payload (e.g. a truck, howitzer, or
container) to the underbody of a military helicopter.  This"external
underslung payload"is then transported from one location to another.
Helicopter slings come in two strengths and sizes.  The 2,500 lb
capacity sling (NSN for full sling set: 1670-01-027-2902) has a
7\/8"outside diameter and is twelve feet long.  The 6,250 lb capacity
sling (NSN for full sling set: 1670-01-027-2900) has a 1 1\/4"outside
diameter and is twelve feet long.  Each sling leg consists of a nylon
rope made from double-braided nylon rope with an eye splice at each end.
  The outer braid is covered with a vinyl coating.  Helicopter slings
are exposed to harsh environmental conditions.  They are dragged over
sand, dirt and cement.  They"re exposed to blowing sand and debris under
 a helicopter during payload hookup and forward flight.  The slings can
also be sprayed with or submerged in salt water.  The salt crystals,
upon drying, act as sand as any other foreign particle would and weaken
the sling from the inside out.  Slings can also be subject to vibrations
 during flight.  There is also UV degradation and decay over time.
Manuals TM 4-48.09 and FM 3-55.93 have specific inspection criteria that
 each helicopter sling load (HSL) component must meet in order to be
deemed safe for use.  Recent deployments have demonstrated the
susceptibility of damage to textile ropes, slings and pendants due to
sand penetration in desert environments.  During storage, transport and
usage, sand has been shown to work its way into the core,
strength-bearing fibers of textile slings where the sand can cause
microscopic damage to these fibers.  This damage leads to reduced
strength and safety. The current inspection practices are acceptable for
 metallic components; however these inspection techniques cannot
accurately determine the disposition of the internal fibers of the
ropes.    Since the current inspection process for ropes, slings and
pendants is subjective, it produces different results with different
inspectors.  In most cases the equipment is removed from service prior
to reaching the minimum breaking strength of the double braided rope.
This means that the inspection process is generating a false positive
result for unserviceable equipment. In other cases the slings break in
flight leading to the loss of payload and possible loss of life.  About
seven years ago, tests were conducted on HSL sling legs in an effort to
correlate rope break strength to the visual inspection.  The test
results were inconclusive as the breaking strengths did not correlate to
 the external condition of the sling.  A visual inspection can only
verify the surface conditions while the primary load bearing element is
within the sling and not visible.      This SBIR proposes to use
methods, such as but not limited to electro textiles, sling barrier
coats, and\/or low stretch fibers to indicate overload conditions that
could alert the inspector to significant strength loss, etc., to allow
for non-destructive testing and data gathering during testing.  This
would transform the current subjective inspection process into something
 quantifiable, significantly advancing the state of the art.  This
technology, when developed, could be embedded into the Special Patrol
Insertion\/Extraction System (SPIES), Fast Rope Insertion\/Extraction
System (FRIES), Helicopter Sling Load (HSL) equipment and climbing\/
rappelling ropes.  In the cases where personnel are attached to these
ropes, the enhanced inspection techniques would also provide a safety
improvement.  The most successful proposal will present a technology end
 state of"go\/no-go"for a sling based on the proof load values in Table
IV drawing 38850-00009"Rope Assy.  Sling"(attached) regardless of the
type of damage (fiber breakage, UV degradation, chemicals, etc.). This
most successful proposal would determine the overall health of the
entire sling with reference to the proof load values. While the entire
length of the sling must be examined, the areas approximately one inch
beneath each eye splice (end of splice taper) are the most likely
candidates for damage. The device that will measure\/determine the sling
 health should be portable, use DoD-approved batteries, and have an
option for AC and DC power inputs.     PHASE I: Develop innovative
theoretical approaches to determine and display current break strength
of a textile sling or rope without destroying it.  Develop an initial
concept design and model key elements.  Define and develop key component
 technological milestones.  Phase I deliverables include a report
detailing theoretical approaches to the research, an initial concept
design and modeling key elements, key component technological
milestones, a first order prototype design, and a recommended path
forward.    PHASE II: Design, construct and demonstrate the operation of
 a prototype that can accurately and non-destructively determine and
display the strength of a sling or other textile.  Validate accuracy of
prototype.  Conduct life cycle and environmental testing of prototype.
Phase II deliverables include the physical prototype(s) produced, the
prototype design (CAD files, technical drawings), and a report detailing
 Phase II work and a recommended path forward.    PHASE III: Refine and
improve Phase II prototype design to be more user friendly and
size\/cost efficient.  Manufacture at least one of the refined\/improved
 prototypes.  Conduct user evaluations in the field.  Write
training\/operator manual. One specific military application would be to
 use this prototype for HSL sling inspections prior to a mission. The
most likely path for transition to operational capability, in the
absence of a formal requirements document, would be for an air assault
unit to formally request the ability to non-destructively test\/inspect
their slings. Potential commercial applications could include helicopter
 sling load but would most likely center around inspection of crane
slings or climbing ropes.    PHASE III DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS:  Military
and civilians using any kind of textile, especially a sheathed one like a
 sling, are under the same subjective inspection restrictions.  An
objective strength inspection without pull testing is not currently
possible.  Therefore, any product that is produced through this SBIR
work would be viable in both military and commercial applications (crane
 slings and rock climbing rope).",

Protection Eyewear",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop innovative anti-fog
technology concepts compatible with impact resistant transparent
materials and associated coatings that can be applied to optically
corrected complex curvature lenses.    DESCRIPTION: Fogging of eyewear
has been a long standing issue regardless of the eyewear purpose.
Protective eyewear is only effective when worn properly; however, if the
 user cannot see through the protective eyewear due to fogging, the
eyewear is most often removed to accomplish the tasks and thus negates
the protection.  There are many commercial anti-fog coatings available,
however the anti-fogging performance is still highly variable and
subject to trade-offs with other performance objectives such as
compatibility with the lens material, anti-scratch coatings, and
resistance to chemicals among the chief concerns.    An innovative new
approach to prevent fogging is needed.  Ideas such as highly durable
superhydrophilic surfaces or coatings, oleophobic coatings to aid in
self-cleaning and other unique approaches are desired. Concepts should
be compatible with the various impact resistant transparent materials in
 use today, such as polycarbonate and nylon, and the associated
anti-scratch and anti-reflective coatings used with those materials as
determined by tests described in ANSI Standard Z87.1 and MIL-PRF-32432.
 Permanent and re-applied approaches are considered, however
treatment\/coatings lasting longer than 6 weeks of continued anti-fog
usage would be highly desired.  The new concepts must maintain the lens
materials ability to meet ANSI Z87.1 standard and military ballistic
fragment protection requirements, and ultimately to meet performance
tests described in MIL-PRF-32432, and be able to be applied to optically
 corrected complex curvature lenses.  Powered concepts must minimize
power consumption, be nearly inaudible (15 dB or less) when worn,
self-contained for power, minimize wearer vibration, and maintain
compatibility with helmet fit, and not prone to snagging.  Powered
concepts should have a goal of being able to last a full 72 hour mission
 without needing a battery change\/recharge.    Anti-fog effectiveness
should be evaluated according to the established international
standards, such as ASTM F659 Appendix A, EN 168, and others as
acceptable, with an ideal goal of having a change in Haze (ASTM Standard
 D1003-00) of less than 2%.    PHASE I: Identify candidate anti-fog
concepts and demonstrate anti-fog effectiveness.  Demonstrate the
ability to incorporate concept and show compatibility with impact
resistant transparent materials in optically corrected complex curvature
 lens geometry.  Identify partnerships with an eyewear manufacturer for
guidance on manufacturability.  Mitigate risk by identifying and
addressing the most challenging technical barriers in order to establish
 viability of the concept.     PHASE II: Refine the anti-fog technology
concept to improve anti-fog effectiveness and address ability for high
volume manufacturing.  For powered concepts, optimize the size\/power
consumption with a goal of lasting for a 72 hour mission without
requiring a battery change\/recharge.  Minimize sound and vibration to
the user.  Conduct initial ballistic fragment protection tests and
rework design as necessary.  Provide at least 50 final version working
prototypes for government testing and initial Warfighter acceptance
testing.    PHASE III: Further develop concept anti-fog technology for a
 final technology able to be incorporated into manufacturing lines of
protective eyewear manufacturers.  Conduct full acceptance tests in
accordance with MIL-PRF-32432 on an Authorized Protection Eyewear List
(APEL) approved product.    PHASE III DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS:  The
initial use for this technology will be to improve anti-fog performance
of military protective eyewear.  Additional dual-use applications will
naturally cover the commercial protective eyewear markets.  Depending
upon the applicability of the technology, additional dual-use
applications would cover any commercial market needing anti-fog
protection for transparent materials such as recreational SCUBA divers,
automotive windows, aircraft windows, instrument panel windows, etc.",

        "topic_name": "Novel Power Solutions for Fuzing and Munitions
Applications",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop innovative and cost effective
 power source solutions for fuzing and munitions applications that will
improve reserve battery technology, improve energy harvesting
capabilities and\/or enable utilization of active battery technologies.
    DESCRIPTION: Munitions power sources, traditionally reserve
batteries (liquid and thermal), are a critical component of fuzing
technologies which require electrical energy for providing mission power
 to electronic systems. The size and power reduction advancements that
have been realized in the supported electronics enable performance
functionality traditionally associated with larger munition fuzing
(155mm and 105mm Howitzer) to extend to smaller munitions platforms such
 as medium caliber munitions (e.g 40mm, 30mm, etc.). These
largely-consumer-electronics-driven technology advances from circuit
integration and smaller die sizes have not progressed proportionally for
 the DOD-unique reserve batteries that are needed for power, resulting
in unique DoD solutions.     The complex mechanical design and
manufacture of these miniature high power devices are driven by the
performance requirements of medium caliber munitions (30mm and 40mm),
including a twenty year shelf life, flight times less than a minute, and
 temperature ranges that include storage at high (165 degrees F)
temperatures, an operating temperature range that extends as low as -45
degrees F, and very fast turn-on (rise time) performance which demands
the use of highly-reactive electrochemical materials. The power sources
must activate reliably at setback levels while providing sufficient drop
 safety and reliability, and also survive extreme gun launch conditions.
 Specifically, these power sources should meet the following
requirements: 2.9 V minimum, 40 mA, rise times of 10 ms@2 mA and 100 ms @
 40 mA, active life of 20 sec under max load, setback forces up to 100
kg's, spin rates of 1000 rps, size of .255"dia x .275"length.    As a
result, munitions designers are facing challenging integration problems
with no readily available power source. Additionally, the uniqueness of
current power sources has created a supply issue and a dwindling
industrial base. When successful, this SBIR will provide a more
universal power source that meets the above requirements and applies to
all current and future electronic fuzing regardless of caliber.    The
Government is seeking cost effective innovative solutions, including but
 not limited to improving existing reserve battery technology. Novel
power source solutions\/architectures would incorporate energy
harvesting devices with increased efficiencies. All of these proposed
solutions would be subject to meeting the requirements described above.
Present power source technical challenges are experienced for the medium
 caliber munitions allotted volume, but this topic is not limited to
this form factor.    PHASE I: Investigate concepts and approaches for
novel power source solutions that address current technical challenges
for fuzing and munitions applications.  Deliver an engineering study
that identifies the key components or technologies that will be
demonstrated in Phase II and technical risks associated (e.g. but not
limited to performance, manufacturing, volume, etc).    PHASE II:
Develop prototype hardware based on Phase 1 findings for solutions to
the identified power source technical challenges. The prototype shall at
 a minimum be demonstrated in a simulated environment (demonstrating
compliance to the requirements listed above) and shall be easily
verified to show increased performance over legacy technology.
Government facilites may be needed to perform verification testing,
specifically to simulate gun launch environment. A cost analysis will
also be delivered to estimate unit production costs.    PHASE III:
Assuming success, this power source technology could be used in existing
 and planned munitions, either as a pre-planned product improvement or
insertion into development efforts. The technology will enable a new
generation of munitions power sources that are applicable to direct and
indirect fire applications, to include medium caliber, tank, mortar,
artillery, rocket, missiles, and consumer electronic devices and smart
phones.",

        "topic_name": "Printed Low Voltage Munition Ignition Bridge",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a printed low voltage
Ignition Bridge for munition detonators and igniters that can be mass
produced on standard\/current production equipment.     DESCRIPTION:
Detonators and Igniters are used in munitions to initiate energetic
materials to detonate or burn, resulting in propulsion or explosion.
Since printed electronics and energetics is a relatively new technology,
 current printed igniters are produced in laboratory scale, not
maximizing efficiencies of mass production. Additionally, the very small
 size of printed micro initiators may facilitate the use of additional
energetics to enhance performance and lethality and may facilitate the
integration of"smart fuzing"electronics within the warhead. Smart fuzing
 can increase munitions lethality effectiveness significantly. Recent
advances in printing techniques demonstrate the capability for low-cost,
 mass produced ignition bridges. These techniques include, but are not
limited to, screen and inkjet printing. This topic encourages new and
novel mass fabrication approaches for low cost and variable volume
production of ignition bridges with that will accommodate adaptable
design changes. Designs should be amiable to inclusion of other
manufacturing processes to construct complete detonators. Proposed
technologies should investigate the utility of the process for
deposition onto or into various flexible and rigid substrates, including
 but not limited to polymers, paper, circuit boards and ceramics. The
ability to change the deposition process and\/or equipment is an
important design criterion, in this context"flexible"means that the
processes and equipment can be used for many different purposes, not
just for the prescribed design. This will facilitate lower production
costs for smaller production runs because the equipment can be used for
multiple products.    This topic will result in a mass producible (in
the range of 14,000 units per year) material solution that will provide
ignition of MEMS based medium caliber fuzing as well as indirect fire
cannon artillery post launch propulsion systems, resulting in increased
reliability and performance of the fuze and\/or post launch propulsion
system.    PHASE I: Perform an engineering study of current and future
electronic printing production techniques that will demonstrate the
feasibility of applying mass fabrication techniques to printed bridges
in ammunition fuzes and boosters (medium and large caliber). The study
shall include a product performance and heat transfer analysis, weight
saving analysis, and a manufacturing cost analysis; and will conclude
with production of generic design prototypes.     Goals for the study
are as follows:   1.  Demonstrate by analysis that the technology can
survive and perform safely and reliability in the high heat (160+
degrees F) and high shock (20,000+ g"s) environment of the ammunition
and gun tube.  2.  Realize a weight savings of at least 10 percent from
the current designs (for example, the current Multi Option Fuze for
Artillery (MOFA) weighs 1.85 pounds, application of this technology
should reduce the weight to 1.67 pounds)  3.  Realize a cost savings of
at least 20 percent of the current unit costs (for example, the unit
cost of the MOFA is approximately $300, application of this technology
should reduce the cost to $240)  4.  Demonstrate by analysis and
prototype fabrication the feasibility of a pilot production run of 100
units in a 24 hour period    Specific values related to cost,
size\/weight, and environmental conditions for each intended end item
will be provided to the contractor after contract award for use in the
analyses.    PHASE II: Based on success of the Phase I study (as
validated during Phase I by government Subject Matter Experts), Phase II
 efforts will focus on developing and producing specific material
solutions that will provide ignition of MEMS based medium caliber fuzing
 as well as indirect fire cannon artillery and mortar fuze and post
launch propulsion systems. The result will be new or modified designs
that leverage the mass production techniques and equipment identified in
 Phase I, and a verification of the mass production capability by
demonstrating the ability to produce at least 100 units of one design in
 a 24 hour period and switching to a different design on the same
equipment to produce 100 in the subsequent 24 hour period. These
produced items will then be tested in a simulated operational gun launch
 environment (most likely at a government facility) to validate
performance is reliable, safe and survives the intended environment. The
 contractor is responsible for defining the pilot production procedures
and simulated operational test procedures.    The final report will
include the design data developed in Phase II, results of the pilot runs
 and simulated operational testing (including all procedures followed),
and a cost analysis of producing the designs given the selected
manufacturing method(s).    PHASE III: Phase III will qualify the
successful Phase II designs in the end item, to include validation by
all applicable safety review boards. This will result in insertion of
the new technology in the end item as a product improvement or next
generation design implementation. The results of this topic will also
have widespread application to commercial electronics, particularly
where miniature form factor and flexible geometries are required.",

degraded visual environment strategy and fixed design requirement per
ADS-33E-PRF, is a Attitude Command Attitude Hold - Height Hold (ACAH-HH)

Traditionally, full authority systems have been employed to achieve DVE

also meet this requirement which saves on system weight and cost due to
the removal of redundancy requirements. The key to implementing partial
authority augmentation for DVE is to ensure target Handling Quality

that maximizes soft soil mobility and mitigates road breakaway rollovers
 on 10-37 ton wheeled vehicles. i.e. Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV)
 and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles.     DESCRIPTION:
The Army is looking for opportunities to enhance soft soil (mud and
sand) mobility and reduce vehicle rollovers caused by road breakaways
using advanced suspension technologies.  The suspension technology would
 be designed and developed for use on JLTV and MRAP vehicle platforms
with the intent of maximizing the vehicles soft soil performance and
reducing the severity of road break away rollovers.  There has been
significant work in the past on advanced suspension technologies that
improve ride and handling stability of various vehicles, but no work in
the area of suspension control algorithms that can walk a vehicle out of
 an immobilized condition in soft soil or prevent a rollover when the
road breaks away under a heavy vehicle.  These are the two largest
mobility issues for MRAPs and have a high likelihood to be an issue for
JLTV especially since it is intended to operate in much softer soils
than MRAP.      This suspension system will require the ability to
rapidly respond to unexpected events, and control the vehicle"s movement
 throughout its entire suspension"s travel range.  Control algorithms
will need to be developed that can detect a rollover event and properly
mitigate it while at speeds of up to 65 mph without causing a loss of
control of the vehicle.  Additionally, control algorithms will need to
be developed to determine when a vehicle is stuck in mud or sand, and
generate enough load transfer, from side to side, to get the vehicle
unstuck.    The Army is looking for innovative ideas in the area related
 to mobility, and more specifically suspension systems, to improve
Soldier performance in the field when they encounter unexpected mission
or life threatening events.  The final product of this effort would be
to build and test a prototype system to determine and demonstrate the
systems ultimate level of capability.    PHASE I: In phase I, the
Contractor would propose a technological solution that would enhance
soft soil (mud and sand) mobility and reduce vehicle rollovers caused by
 road breakaways using an advanced suspension technology, develop a
model that demonstrates the functionality and performance improvements
that can be expected with the technology, and then write a final report
that summarizes the effort and the expected benefits should the system
be built and developed for the MRAP Family of Vehicles or the JLTV.  The
 report will include a summary of the data generated, the benefits of
the system, the concerns related to integration onto the vehicle, an
estimate of the expected durability of the proposed system, and any
commercial applications of the system.    PHASE II: In Phase II, the
Contractor would generate detailed designs of the parts modeled in Phase
 I. The contractor would fabricate the parts and install them in an MRAP
 or JLTV.  Once the parts are installed the contractor would conduct a
proof of principle (PoP) test to demonstrate the performance
improvements.  Finally the contractor would write a technical report
detailing the results of the test, the potential of manufacturability of
 the components, and the cost of the integration and parts should the
system go into production.    PHASE III:  In Phase III, the Contractor
shall develop detailed manufacturing and instillation plans for use on
the MRAP All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV), the MaxxPro Plus, and the JLTV
vehicle (still to be determined).  The Contractor shall also determine
the potential use of this product on agricultural and mining vehicles.",

        "topic_name": "Real-Time and Simplified Sensors to Support
Mobile Wastewater Treatment",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a real-time in-line
diagnostic tool to provide simple and timely verification that treated
water is safe to discharge     DESCRIPTION: This SBIR topic will deliver
 technology that the Army can integrate into its future wastewater
treatment concept of operations. The Army is developing mobile
wastewater treatment systems to provide tactical base commanders more
organic logistics support. This will reduce their need for wastewater
convoys. The limited manpower at small bases will not include wastewater
 specialists, so operators must be enabled with simple, effective
methods to verify the wastewater treatment process and to ensure that
the treated water is safe to discharge. Essential process verification
measurements relating to the nutrient content of the water can neither
be done on-site nor in frequent intervals. This means that the operators
 are lacking key information to adjust or correct wastewater treatment
system operations to avoid pollution. There are a variety of measurement
 options that satisfy wastewater discharge permit requirements and
parameters of interest include (but are not limited to): chemical oxygen
 demand, biological oxygen demand, total organic carbon, and coliform
bacteria. As a worst case, the standard method to measure biological
oxygen demand (BOD5) takes 5 days and so some quicker measurement
methods will likely be predictive. As an innovative effort, this request
 is NOT looking for proposals that integrate various commercial items
with minor modifications to meet the above requirements. The proposals
should identify cutting edge research that allows for the consolidation
of the wastewater treatment verification parameters on a single platform
 such as a chip that will also overcome the limitations of the current
commercial methods towards real-time process verification for quickly
emplaced treatment systems.  The effort should focus on primarily on the
 development of sensors rather than data loggers, controls or
communications. Ideally, prototypes delivered to the Army would be used
to demonstrate capability to monitor wastewater discharge during Army
technology demonstrations (TECD4a) for small base support from 2016 to
2017.     PHASE I: Demonstrate feasibility of core technology in a
laboratory setting. Verify measurement range or sensitivity equivalent
to commercially available equipment currently used by the water
industry. Verify accuracy by comparing the results to analysis conducted
 using the appropriate reference method from the current edition of
Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater. Directly
measured physical and chemical properties should have an accuracy within
 10%. Each parameter shall be tested in standard preparations and then
selected tap water mixtures.     PHASE II: Design, build a complete
sensor prototype for multiple wastewater analytes housed within a single
 platform no larger than one cubic foot. The sensor should be capable of
 communication with a device (internal or external, preferably commonly
available) to log data. Test integrated prototypes to the criteria of
phase I with standard preparations and collected water. Delivered
prototype must be suitable for 3rd party and Army laboratory testing and
 field demonstration, but design does not need to be finalized, nor is
military standard durability required. Clear operational manuals do not
require military format. During this phase, the Army expects to work
closely to clarify mission integration requirements appropriate for the
initial prototype maturity.     PHASE III: Final solution is a
quick-connect autonomous inline system but a kit that accepts batch
samples may be suitable. The sensor platform should be self-calibrating
with duration of at least one month before recalibration is needed. The
most supportable design would utilize commonly available supplies,
common communication protocols and not directly interface with the
controls of the wastewater treatment system. The Army can integrate the
technology developed under this SBIR into the mobile wastewater
treatment systems being developed to answer Acquisition requirements.
Water utilities could insert the technology developed under this SBIR in
 facilities to improve maintenance and reduce contamination of our
nation"s waterways. Broader application may be for monitoring in
accordance with discharge permits for industrial and municipal
facilities.",

full sized high energy density capacitor for microsecond discharge times
 operating at high voltages with an energy density greater than or equal

 in need of pulse power components that dramatically reduce weight and
volume, while meeting the high voltage needs of a pulse forming network.
 Recent advances in the production and performance of current capacitors
 for the US Army have achieved many milestones; however there is only
one known US vendor able to produce a high energy density capacitor.
The topic goals are to develop another source that has the ability to
produce a high energy density capacitor.  In order to meet this goal, an
 innovative approach is desired to meet the required discharge life,
energy density, and pulse widths.    PHASE I: In Phase I, deliver a
study that demonstrates novel methods of producing a high energy density
 pulse forming network capacitor. The capacitor should be optimized for
DC lifetime with the goal of achieving the highest energy density
possible while maintaining a discharge life of 10 events; discharge
times are in the microsecond pulse widths.  This study shall include
modeling that allows the contractor to demonstrate the capabilities of
the high energy density capacitor.    PHASE II: Upon successful
completion of Phase I, design and fabricate a high energy density
capacitor suitable for a high voltage (3 kilo-Volt (kV) to 7kV range)
pulse forming networks. Energy density should meet or exceed
1.2Joules\/cubic centimeter (J\/cc). Contractors are encouraged to
collaborate with the Army on minimizing the packaging designs and
reducing weight and volume. A working prototype should also be submitted
 to Army for evaluation.    PHASE III: in phase III, the contractor
shall design and fabricate a high energy density capacitor suitable for a
 high voltage (above 7kV) pulse forming networks, based on improvements
from phase II. Energy density should meet or exceed 1.3J\/cc. Minimum DC
 lifetime of 1000 hours and 10 discharge events.",

        "topic_name": "Hot Stamping of Thick Gage Armored Steels",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  This topic will identify material
formulas, manufacturing process and parameters to allow complex die
forming of thick gage armored steel components. Upon successful
completion, this technology may be used on all army platforms including
GCV &amp; JLTV.  This technology will improve structural and armored
panel performance while reducing part count.  Anticipated application
will include underbelly protection.     DESCRIPTION:  Steel armor
manufacturing processes produce flat sheets\/plates of heat treated
armor steels. These raw materials mandate flat surfaces on army vehicles
 which compromises the armor protection due to the mandated joining
technologies. Armor panels are typically joined using bolts or welds.
Welding allows for continuous joints but negates the heat treatment of
the armored steel in the weld heat affected zone, thus reducing the
protective properties. Bolts compromise protection due to non-continuous
 joints and require material overlap. A method is required to form
armored steel into complex shapes without reducing the materials
protective properties.     Presently, the automotive industry uses hot
stamped steel in high production environments to create crash
protective"cages"using steels up to 2.5mm thick. As stated, the current
production material properties are optimized for automotive crash
conditions. The army requires material with properties which, after
forming, will meet the Army high hard and rolled homogeneous armor steel
 specifications. Formed thicknesses of interest in this project range
from 2.5mm up to 50mm.     Upon successful completion the Army will use
this technology to form underbelly protection panels, driver hatches,
gunner protection kits etc with reduced part count, fewer joints, less
weight and improved protection. Application of this technology to form
non-standard military vehicle panels is of immediate interest (example:
form an armored steel Ford Ranger door outer skin).     PHASE I:  Phase I
 is expected to identify and supply the correct metallurgical material
properties\/formulas required in the base purchased material such that
the properties after processing\/forming will be within 95% of the
values specified in the MIL specifications (see references listed
below).  Materials of interest are rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) and
high hard armor (Hi-hard) steel.  Form tolerances of stamped components
must be held within +\/1.5mm.  Material suppliers for the base material
must be identified and information including material cost, volume break
 points and lead time to procure the base materials (which upon
completion of the forming process will result in the specified
properties for Hi-hard and RHA) is to be provided.  Thicknesses to be
addressed will vary up to 2"thick.     Forming methods, computer
simulation, testing parameters and testing methods shall be developed.
Testing parameters and methods (test plan) will require TARDEC approval.
 Of interest in this project is production of 2 ft. square blanks, 4 ft
square"boat hulls"and 4 ft square"V"shaped panels samples from both
steel variants.  Bend radii at 3 times metal thickness is required, 2
times metal thickness is desired.  Upon completion of Phase I a complete
 study including all details required to enter into Phase II will be
provided to US Army TARDEC.    PHASE II:  Phase II is expected to
produce, test and verify the material properties of the 2 ft. square
blanks, 4 ft square"boat hulls"and 4 ft square"V"shaped configuration
identified in Phase I.  Samples\/testing will be required in both high
hard steel and rolled homogeneous steel. TARDEC will be provided the
test results as detailed in the"test plan"which was developed and
approved in Phase I. Both manufacturing (draw\/forming) and performance
(finite element analysis, ballistic and blast) computer simulations are
to be verified for the four thicknesses specified and for both materials
 types. US Army TARDEC is to receive 10 samples of the 2 ft. square
blanks, 4 ft square"boat hulls"and 4 ft square"V"shaped configuration
and both material types.     TRL: (Technology Readiness Level) TRL

and\/or application formulated    PHASE III:  Phase III is expected to
specify the plan to commercialize this technology for both defense and
commercial applications. Manufacturing readiness assessments are to be
provided with specific interest in the maximum sizes and weights of
panels which can be manufactured. The initial defense interest is in
forming a full vehicle underbelly protection shield for the ground
combat vehicle, forming door outer panels for commercial light truck
applications and forming vehicle body structures for the Joint Light
Tactical Vehicle. It is expected that the individual submitters will
present plans for additional commercial usage and partnerships.",

        "topic_name": "Electronic Warfare Battle Damage Assessment",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project is to
develop and demonstrate a modular, open system architecture system to
provide an EW operator or system of the effectivenss of an electronic
attack.      DESCRIPTION: EW systems attempt to disrupt or degrade an
adversary"s electronic assets and serve as an invaluable force
protection asset to prevent the adversary"s access to their electronics.
  Many of the electronic attack (EA) techniques used are relatively
brute force and often apply a greater amount of power than the minimum
required, ensuring that the desired effect is realized.  However, the
operational tradeoff of using more power than necessary is that it
precludes the availability of the excess power for another attack at the
 same time.  In order to prevent an EA from using more power than
necessary, a feedback mechanism is required to inform an operator or the
 EA system how effective the attack is.  This technique is known as
battle damage assessment (BDA).      The output of an EW BDA is most
effective in real time (seconds) or near-real-time (hours) to provide
timely, actionable feedback.  For this SBIR topic, one of the challenges
 is to identify techniques that can provide autonomous, real-time EW BDA
 feedback with as much fidelity as possible without a significant amount
 of processing requirements.  A second challenge of this SBIR topic is
to develop autonomous, near-real-time techniques that generate very high
 fidelity data in a matter of hours.  Desired features include:
Technique to generate low-fidelity, real-time BDA reporting    Technique
 to generate high-fidelity, near-real-time BDA reporting    Extract the
BDA information without physical contact with the enemy asset, from
standoff ranges equal to, or greater than, the standoff used by the EA
system    Report the EA lethality estimate along with margin of
uncertainty    Extract the BDA information from as many as 10 targets at
 the same time    The current state of the art for EW BDA is extremely
limited for EA systems that attack wireless communication devices.  A
broad body of knowledge exists for EW systems that attack conventional
targets such as missiles and vehicles, for which there is a clear and
discernible physical body for which to measure the effectiveness of an
EA.  As an example, techniques exist for measuring the change in flight
trajectory or velocity of a missile.    However, when attempting to make
 a BDA for a wireless system for which there is no physical medium to
measure, there are few, if any, techniques that are widely documented
and demonstrated to be effective.  Therefore, this SBIR represents a
significant opportunity to increase the state of the art in EW BDA
specifically for wireless systems which greatly enhances the capability
of future Army EW systems such as the Multi-Function Electronic Warfare
(MFEW) system under Project Raven Fire.    PHASE I:  Phase I will
perform a feasibility study of the proposed approach to deal with common
 wireless threats.  This study will document the viability, risks, and
tradeoffs.  This feasibility study will also identify technical
approaches to the proposed solutions.  The approach which offers the
best balance of technical risk and performance will be developed into a
deliverable prototype capable of demonstration in a laboratory
environment.  It is envisioned that no more than one meeting will be
held at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.  All other communications and
 meetings will be via telecon\/VTC or held at the contractor facility.
US Government contractors maybe used to facilitate proposal evaluation
but they will not be technical evaluators.    PHASE II: Hardware and
software will be developed and produced in support of relevant field
environment testing and evaluation on terrestrial (vehicle\/dismount)
platforms.  Contractor will validate that the prototype(s) meet the
performance objectives and will demonstrate the EW BDA capability in a
field environment.  A plan will be developed to detail the development,
demonstration, maturation, and validation and verification (V+V) of
these capabilities to assist in a transition to Phase III.  The small
business will deliver one prototype for each of the platforms, one for
the vehicle mounted and one for the dismount platform.      PHASE III:
Develop and implement a technology transition plan with PD Raven Fire.
The transition should include further technology maturation to
Information Assurance, Environmental, and EMI\/EMC considerations.
Finalize the EW BDA hardware and software, and conduct qualification
testing of the product with R &amp; D prototype and actual EW\/EA
production hardware. This technology is applicable to the US Army and
other DoD users that require EW\/EA capability. Potential commercial
applications include local, county, state or federal law enforcement
sales of the original system.  A second commercial application is the
prediction of the effects of unwanted EMI on commercial system to reduce
 EMI to an acceptable level to ensure proper operation of the commercial
 electronic devices.  The expected transition to Program of Record use
would be in the Multi-Function Electronic Warfare and Defensive
Electronic Attack PORs.",

Rebroadcast",

develop and demonstrate Global Positioning System (GPS) pseudo-satellite
 antenna solutions that are capable of installation and operation on a
US Army Tier II\/III UAS and US Army Ground Vehicles.     DESCRIPTION:
While GPS is the most prevalent navigation method in use today, its weak
 satellite signal is vulnerable to both unintentional interference and
deliberate jamming from an adversary. With so much of the Army"s
operations and infrastructure depending on GPS, means are urgently
needed to assure the continued availability of GPS-based Position,
Navigation, and Timing (PNT) capabilities. Traditionally this has been
solved through neutralization of the jammer or nulling or cancellation
of the jammer signal. An alternative method is the reception,
processing, and re-broadcast of the GPS Signal by a pseudo-satellite, or
 pseudolite. The intent of this initiative is to develop antenna
solutions to broadcast the GPS augmentation signal according to
IS-ICD-250. On a Tier II\/III UAS, this antenna will need to be
installed as a secondary payload and will be used to broadcast the GPS
augmentation signal. On terrestrial platforms, the antenna will need to
transmit the GPS augmentation signal according to IS-ICD-250. It is
intended that no more than two antenna solutions will be necessary, one
for the air tier and one for the terrestrial platforms. The antennas
must function with existing pseudolite transceiver hardware developed
under other US Army programs which will be used in later phases for test
 and demonstration.     PHASE I: Phase I will perform a feasibility
study of the antennas for the Tier II\/III UAS and terrestrial platforms
 and their respective missions. This study will document the viability,
risks, and tradeoffs. This feasibility study will also identify
technical approaches to the required antenna solutions. The platform

 applicable to the US Army and other DoD users that require Assured PNT
capability. The envisioned production rate is 20 antennas per month, for
 a total of approximately 1,500 systems to support Army pseudolite
requirements.",

        "topic_name": "All Digital Radar",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: With recent advancements in digital
processing technology, there exists the capability to develop an all
digital radar.  The purpose of this topic is to solicit research and
development of an all digital transmit\/receive module and a radar back
end capable of processing resulting large data sets.  This design should
 have the potential of growing into a final software and hardware design
 leading to a demonstration on actual hardware.      DESCRIPTION:
Conventional radar receivers are constructed with analog components.
Only the demodulated baseband signal is converted (at the sub-array
level) to digital format using a medium speed analog-to-digital
converter (ADC).  Since analog components are sensitive to temperature,
supply voltage and semiconductor processing variations, the performance
of analog radar receiver is limited and power hungry.  With the
development of digital processing technology, there are emerging trends
toward digitization in radar receiver designs by applying direct
intermediate frequency-to-digital conversion (IF sampling) and a direct
digital synthesizer  (DDS) at the transmit\/receive (T\/R) module.
Digitization at the T\/R module allows for much higher precision, lower
noise, lower power and stability than analog counterparts.  Moreover, it
 can retain the extreme flexibility of digital techniques such as direct
 digital modulations and waveform generation.  In order to obtain high
resolution and high anti-jam features, modern radar systems need to
employ more complex waveforms; however, with analog radar receivers it
is difficult to generate and process arbitrary waveforms.      The
All-Digital Radar (ADR) is a revolutionary approach to the development
of modern radars capable of supporting the required functions within
DOD, as well as a variety of potential commercial applications.
Digitization at the T\/R module supports the concept of one design for
all radars.  The ADR is scalable and provides total flexibility for
needs that range from the smallest applications involving the protection
 of a small number of troops up to and including cruise missile defense
and large space-based ballistic applications.  The T\/R module can be
implemented in an integrated chip; hence it consumes much less power and
 is much lighter and more efficient than its conventional analog
counterparts.  The small size, light weight and low power greatly
increase the applicability force protection and communication.  Two
issues have limited the development of the ADR technology: Processing
the data from the ADR array (each T\/R module has the data bandwidth of
conventional radar) and low power ADC.  Solutions to these two issues
are available with today"s technology.    The intent of this effort is
to develop ADR hardware and a digital signal processing back end and
perform analysis of improvements to functionality and cost for radars
and communication system capabilities.  Follow-on efforts will build and
 test a prototype ADR array.    PHASE I: The offeror shall develop a
design of an all-digital T\/R module and the signal\/data processing
backend to aggregate, distribute and process data from a T\/R module
array.  The minimum bandwidth of the module shall be 1 GHz.  The T\/R
module shall include a DDS and an ADC.  The DDS shall be capable of
generating frequency and phase modulated signals.  The ADC shall be low
power (",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this topic is to
investigate and develop concepts of replacement, adaptation, or
modification of the'shotgun'connector on the Hellfire missile that
results in reduced aerodynamic effects, including drag, on the missile
in-flight after launch.      DESCRIPTION: The semi-active laser seeker
guided Hellfire air-to-ground missile provides the most reliable
precision targeting capability in the inventory today. Laser designation
 allows the military to accurately designate the specific target of
interest among urban clutter, decoys, and other less threatening
targets. Such precision targeting minimizes both collateral damage and
the need for multiple strikes to ensure destruction of the target. This
sought after capability has resulted in the desire to increase the range
 of the Hellfire missile and to launch it from high speed fixed wing
aircraft.  The Hellfire missile is carried for use in a rail launcher.
The so called'shotgun'connector on the top of the missile body plugs
into a mating connector on the rail when the missile is mounted and
receives its targeting information and pre-launch power through this
connector.  The connector has shown itself to be both rugged and
reliable.  However, analysis has shown that the missile mounted
connector has high aerodynamic drag and presents an asymmetric load to
lateral airflows and buffeting.  The'shotgun'connector contains two (2)
thirty-seven (37) pin umbilical connectors capable of transmitting 392
watts of 28 VDC power, with possible voltage transients of 18 to 38 VDC.
 Approximately twelve (12) pins are dedicated to power transmission
while the rest are used for signaling, or are unused, depending on the
Hellfire missile model. All pins\/wires in the present connector and
associated internal cable designs are rated for the same electrical
loads, however.  Unclassified drawings and internal views will be
provided upon award of contract.     PHASE I: The goal of Phase I is to
conduct a feasibility study to identify techniques for the replacement,
modification to, or adaption to the Hellfire missile shotgun connector
missile that results in a 90% reduction in aerodynamic effects,
including drag, on the missile in-flight after launch.  The proposed
techniques must accommodate the existing internal packaging of the
missile and cannot require a permanent modification to the connector on
the launcher, since the launcher would have to be able to launch
missiles with and without the proposed modification.  The proposed
techniques must be able to meet the physical environmental and carriage
requirements imposed on the Hellfire and its launcher by the present
Hellfire missile specification.  Phase I should result in
recommendations for the most promising approaches to be pursued in Phase
 II.    PHASE II: The goal of Phase II is to produce prototypes of one
or more of proposed techniques to demonstrate the proposed techniques.
Field testing is expected and can be facilitated and supported by the
Government if laboratory testing demonstrates sufficient promise.
PHASE III: Numerous military programs would benefit from the technology,
 including the Joint Air-to-Ground Missile, Hellfire, Griffin, and other
 rail launched missile systems that require targeting information and
power prior to launch. Limited commercial applications are anticipated
for this technology.",

Thermal Representation and SAF Integration",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Design and build an inexpensive and
ruggedized infrared projection system that can be utilized to create
accurate real-time dynamic thermal representations on target silhouettes
 or other mediums based on training doctrine within the various live and
 virtual training applications to enhance realism and feedback for the
trainee.    DESCRIPTION: A dynamic infrared projection system technology
 would support the creation of a high fidelity, real-time thermal
representation within the Live and\/or Virtual training domains.  The
technology would provide an accurate and realistic thermal portrayal of
battlefield entities, vehicles, threats, and terrain conditions, to
include posture based, time based, and event based modifications to the
thermal representations.  This technology development will advance
thermal representations to be consistent with thermal imaging technology
 used by soldiers and tactical platforms.    Current
technology\/solutions are heating pads adhered to target silhouettes.
The shapes are not accurate, get damaged with live fire engagements, and
 create thermal bleeding (non-realism).  The shapes are static with
respect to time, and do not allow for changes in thermal representations
 over time, movement, or posture changes.  Based on user feedback,
thermal pads provide an unrealistic and limited training experience to
soldiers.    The proposed technology would remove the thermal generation
 from the line of fire; would support the CGI development of highly
accurate (ROC-V\/CID) thermal representations which would be
time\/movement\/action based.  IR projector would also provide positive
threat fire (vice delayed pyrotechnic solution) and vehicle kill
indications (vice simple target silhouette lowering).  IR projector
could be coupled with a simple screen, non-contact hit sensors, and a
SAF model to project multiple targets\/threats simultaneously.    The
potential use cases for the technology would:    Allow for the thermal
representation to change hull or turret orientation toward the training
participant based on training scenario or trainee action     Allow for
the thermal representation to provide a status indication of killed or
damaged via changes to image    Allow for the thermal representation to
provide a visual muzzle flash and instant hot turret\/barrel    Allow
for the thermal representation to provide an escalation of force from
the target (a hostile person raising from bed of a pick-up armed with an
 RPG    The proposed technology would support enhanced realism in the
training domains, and provides a means to link virtual and constructive

 air environment, daylight, nighttime, rain and snow conditions, and
could not rely on cooling systems.  The dynamic IR projection system
would require a high reliability, and would have to require minimal
maintenance actions.    PHASE I: Study, research, and conduct initial
integration and design concepts of core technology components for the
dynamic infrared projection system.  Synchronization of work being
completed by RDECOM, PM ITTS, PEO STRI and academia will be required.
Determine feasibility of adapting DSP\/DLP technology to support IR

durable), and ruggedized platform to support performance in open air
environments (without cooling systems).  Determine feasibility of a
mixed mode projection system to support simultaneous visual and infrared
 images    PHASE II: Refine design and continue technology investigation
 and integration into a prototype baseline, and implement basic modeling
 methods, algorithms, and interfaces between the control system and the
projections system.  Investigate integration with OneSAF and virtual
training systems to provide a projection of the constructive or virtual
entities.  Create algorithms to project multi-layer scenes onto a single
 medium.  Focus on environmental stability and reliability enhancements.

Training and Testing Environments",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a low cost sensor that can
accurately measure angular rate and position of a weapon system in all
Six Degrees Of Freedom (6DOF) which is ultra low power, capable of
determining absolute heading, however, requiring no in initial or
sustainment calibration; for the purposes of Live and Virtual Non
Line-of-Sight (NLOS) and Direct Fire tactical engagement simulation.
DESCRIPTION: Many weapons systems and future concepts cannot be
simulated using current line-of-sight laser-based systems, e.g. Multiple
 Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES), in Live training exercises.
 Additionally, the Army has identified a Virtual small arms weapon
training capability gap, using actual weapons in lieu of simulated
weapons. There are many existing sensors on the commercial market that
meet some of the Army"s requirements but not all of them. Typically,
Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) sensor modules use both gyros and
magnetometers to measure the pointing vector of the weapon system,
however these sensors have many error sources that substantially reduce
the reliability and accuracy of the engagement which results in
unrealistic or negative training.    Current Micro-Electro-Mechanical
Systems (MEMS) technology has provided system on chip capabilities for
measuring 6 DOF orientation, however, due to poor signal-to-noise ratios
 and their sensitivity to temperature changes, accuracy is sacrificed
and has proven insufficient to meet the Army"s technology gap.  Current
high-end, tactical grade Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) provide the
needed accuracy and environmental robustness, but remain unsuitable due
to extraordinarily large size, power consumption and unit cost.  We are
seeking an innovative approach to precisely measure 6 DOF orientation,
but in a low cost and low power form factor.  It must be capable of
measuring absolute heading (geodetic north) with an accuracy of 3 mils.
The approach must be capable of measuring orientation in all
environmental conditions where soldiers can operate.  The device must
operate while undergoing a slew rate of 60 degrees  per second
(threshold metric) and a slew rate of 300 degrees  per second (objective
 metric). Additionally, the sensor and its associated processing
electronics shall be enclosed in a package no greater than 1 inch wide
by 1 inch high by 4 inches long while assuming that power will be
provided externally to the sensor, but also assuming that it is very
scarce.  The sensor should require no initial, nor maintenance
calibration.  We are also seeking a solution which is low cost, at a
production cost of less than $2000 per unit.    PHASE I: Validate
viability of the technical approach through simulation or mathematical
model.     PHASE II: Develop an initial breadboard prototype (TRL4 -
Component and\/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment) and
develop an advanced prototype (TRL6 - System\/subsystem model or
prototype demonstration in a relevant environment) with transition
customer collaboration with respect to requirements, design review, and
prototype test and evaluation.  System must be capable of being mounted
on actual weapon systems and used in the Live\/Virtual training
environments.    PHASE III: Likely military applications are for
simulated tactical engagement training and, UAV (Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle) flight control or ground based unmanned vehicle navigation and
flight control, and for far target laser designators. Commercial
application would be for light aircraft navigation and flight control.
Likely transition opportunities in the test and training domains under
PEO STRI are the One Tactical Engagement Simulation System (OneTESS),
the Dismounted Soldier Training System (DSTS), the Call For Fire Trainer
 (CFFT), and the Engagement Skills Trainer (EST). In the operational
domain, likely transition opportunity exists with PEO Soldier PM Soldier
 Systems &amp; Lasers and their Laser Target Locator Modules (LTLM) that
 implement the use of a digital magnetic compass (DMC).",

        "topic_name": "Explosive Pulsed Power: Ferroelectric Generators
for Advanced Munitions",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this effort is to
develop very compact explosive driven ferroelectric generators capable
of producing more than 500 kV at the input terminals of a variety of
loads.    DESCRIPTION: As we develop new munitions with different types
of payloads, there is an ever increasing requirement for smaller,
lighter, and cheaper electrical power sources for use in a variety of
munitions ranging in size from 25 mm (1 inch) diameter to 18 cm (7
inches) diameter.  In the case of smaller munitions, the number of
available useful power supplies is limited.  One type of pulsed power
source that can meet these limitations is explosive pulsed power. The
field of Explosive Pulsed Power (EPP) [1  4] was established in the
early 1950s. These power supplies either convert the chemical energy
stored in explosives into electrical energy or use the shock waves
generated by explosives to release the energy stored in materials such
as ferroelectrics or ferromagnetic. Explosive pulsed power generators
are currently under investigation by several Department of Defense
Laboratories as power supplies for new classes of warheads and
munitions. Of particular interest is the Ferroelectric Generator (FEG),
since it is one of the few power supplies capable of generating very
high voltages required to drive high power microwave tubes in the
available payload volume on current small munitions. The potential
Achilles heel for FEGs is that they are very low energy devices.  For
them to be useful, one needs to be able to use several FEGs to power a
single circuit.  This means that one must use a single switch for the
oscillator, as opposed to dielectric breakdown switching.  Thus, we need
 either two or three times the energy from a single FEG or a switch that
 requires exceedingly little energy to switch while still being able to
control up to 500 kV.  If either or both of these needs cannot be met,
then the FEG will probably not end up being useful for our sort of
applications.  Thus, the objectives of this effort are to investigate
those mechanical or electric processes that can be modified to increase
the output of FEGs from the state-of-the-art value of 100 kV to 500 kV
and to ascertain their capabilities to drive payloads such as High Power
 Microwave (HPM) sources.  This would include investigating the
influence of such fundamental processes as shock dynamics, the
electrical, mechanical, and chemical properties of ferroelectric and
potting materials used, methods for controlling electrical breakdown,
power conditioning techniques (switches, transformers, etc.), load
characteristics, and so on when driving one or more types of HPM loads.
Since the load impacts the operation of the FEG, it is important that
tests be done with the load.  The desired goal is to deliver 500 kV
pulses to various HPM loads including orbitrons, magnetrons [5], Virtual
 Cathode Oscillators (VIRCATORs), and\/or Magnetically Insulated line
Oscillators (MILOs) having volumes as feasibly small as technically
possible.    PHASE I: The goal of Phase I is to identify those
mechanical, electrical, and\/or chemical characteristics of the
generator that could be modified in order to improves the performance of
 FEGs designed to drive HPM payloads.  This will include doing
proof-of-principle experiments to verify that the correct parameters to
be modified to meet the objectives of this Topic have been identified.
Since the type of explosives used impacts the operation of the FEG,
explosive tests need to be done. This will necessitate the requirement
that the proposing firm have access to approved explosive test
facilities.     PHASE II: The objective of Phase II is to finalize the
design of the FEG and demonstrate that it can deliver 500 kV to various
high power microwave sources. The proposing Firm must also address any
power conditioning and integration issues. In addition, the proposing
Firm should also address any manufacturing issues that would impact the
production of these power supplies.    PHASE III: These FEGs would be
used in pulsed technologies that are applicable to multiple military and
 commercial applications requiring pulsed power.  These include portable
 water purification units, portable nondestructive testing systems,
portable lightning simulators, expendable X-ray sources, burst
communications and telemetry, and oil and mineral exploration. Since
several government labs and prime contractors are developing advanced
munitions, the contractor will need to have developed a business plan
for working with these agencies and companies.",

Computing Platforms",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Design, develop and demonstrate
innovative secure software architectures for mobile computing platforms
to mitigate security threats within a space communications network to
execute tactical missions more effectively and securely.
DESCRIPTION:  As DoD has become increasingly dependent on the use of
mobile computing platforms to conduct mission operations, the need for
improving security in an environment that includes commercial mobile
devices has grown. Key device level security issues facing mobile
computing platforms include network authentication, data protection,
malware defense and mobile ad-hoc networking.  The focus and priority of
 this topic is seeking innovative software architectures for mobile
ad-hoc networking to ensure secure communications in a complex space
network environment. Mobile devices include, but are not limited to,
smart phones and tablets that have a unique combination of computing
power, mobile applications, and access to network data.     Current
software architectures provide insufficient protection necessary for
sensitive DoD systems utilizing mobile computing platforms. The desire
for self-organizing, self-forming, scalable, multi-hop mobile ad hoc
networks poses significant security challenges due to their wireless and
 distributed nature. These characteristics and the frequent networking
reconfiguration make it more vulnerable to intrusions and misbehaviors
than a wired network.  Additionally, applications and operating systems
installed on mobile devices are suspect to malware or spyware, or may
perform unexpected functions such as tracking user actions or sending
private information to outsiders. Malicious activities could disrupt
Army networks and compromise sensitive information. Finally, current
mobile devices and software architectures are limited by their
processing capability for executing complex encryption algorithms or
mission data intensive computations.     Preliminary research
assessments highlight the availability of next generation
device\/component technologies and outline novel architecture designs
with the potential to significantly improve network security. Of
particular interest are Android-based platform solutions with multiple
processors. Secure software architectures are being sought that fully
utilize multiple processors within these devices and across a mobile ad
hoc network to increase security, robustness, and computation
capability.     New innovative solutions are required in the form of
secure software architectures for mobile ad-hoc networks to protect
applications and data within a complex space network environment from
being exploited or exfiltrated from advanced threats. Solutions should
target one or more of the issues defined here and should be scalable
across a network of mobile devices.      PHASE I: Research and develop
novel secure software architectures for mitigating security threats
within a mobile ad-hoc network. Provide a proof-of-concept design and
prototype demonstrating the feasibility of the concept. Verify the
Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at the conclusion of Phase I.     PHASE
 II: Based on the verified successful results of Phase I, refine and
extend the proof-of-concept design into a fully functioning
pre-production prototype.  Verify the TRL at the conclusion of Phase II.
     PHASE III: Develop the prototype into a comprehensive solution that
 could be used in a broad range of military and civilian mobile device
network applications where increased security is required. This
demonstrated capability will benefit and have transition potential to
Department of Defense (DoD) weapons and support systems, federal, local
and state organizations as well as commercial entities.",

        "topic_name": "Bipolar Lead Acid Batteries for Military Vehicle
Application",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: Develop bipolar lead acid batteries
that provide lighter weight and lower volume, for military vehicle
applications.    DESCRIPTION: Lead acid batteries are used in nearly all
 military ground vehicles. Many times, the size and weight of these
batteries become prohibitive to meeting vehicle architecture and
performance requirements. Bipolar lead acid technology offers a
significant reduction in size and weight through the elimination of up
to 50% of the inert lead grids.     Traditional lead acid military
batteries utilize a mono-polar construction, in which each cell consists
 of two plates (positive and negative) and each plate consists of a
heavy lead metal grid pasted with active material. These plates are
paired up to make a cell, and these cells are connected in series with
metal connectors.  In a bipolar design, each plate has positive active
material on one side and negative active material on the other. Cells
are created by stacking bipolar plates together so that the negative of
one plate is paired with a positive of another plate, with each cell
separated by the bipolar plate material. This construction alone offers
an almost 50% reduction in inactive plate material. Additionally, the
elimination of metallic connectors connecting the cells further reduces
the weight and decreases the batteries internal resistance.     Further
improvements to the bipolar design can be accomplished through the
investigation of alternate plate material and appropriate sealing
techniques.  An optimal bipolar plate material would be lightweight,
inexpensive, and corrosion resistant.  An appropriate sealing technique
would prevent electrolyte from crossing between cells.    Once an
optimized bipolar lead acid battery design is established, the intended
application would be a military vehicle starter battery. The current
military lead acid batteries have an energy density of around 40Wh\/kg ,
 a specific energy 100 Wh\/L and are capable of at least 120 deep
discharge cycles. Some common military vehicle batteries are the 6T,
4HN, and 2HN, as well as some commercial form factors (Group 31, Group
75\/86, Group 78, etc).      A successful battery design would
demonstrate improvements in energy density (60Wh\/kg), specific energy
(150Wh\/L) and deep discharge cycle life (300 cycles). Additionally, the
 ideal final design would fit a standard military form factor and meet
or exceed the weight, capacity, cold cranking amps, life cycle, and
battery resistance requirements for that standard    PHASE I: A
successful Phase I would result in the development of bipolar lead acid
cells that demonstrate 70Wh\/kg energy density, 200Wh\/L specific
energy, and 50 deep discharge cycles on the cell level. Deliverables
would include at least 5 bipolar lead acid cells for laboratory testing.
    PHASE II: A successful Phase II would scale up or otherwise optimize
 the cells developed in Phase I to fit a specific military form factor.
These cells would be assembled into a multi cell string or battery
module that demonstrate the feasibility of reaching the end goal of
60Wh\/kg energy density, 150Wh\/L specific energy, and 300 deep
discharge cycles. Deliverables would include at least 3 bipolar lead
acid strings\/modules for laboratory testing.    PHASE III: A successful
 Phase III would result in the development of bipolar lead acid battery
that adheres to a standard military form factor and meets or exceeds
military the specifications for weight, capacity, CCA, internal
resistance, and cycle life.  This battery should demonstrate 60Wh\/kg
energy density, 150Wh\/L specific energy, and 300 deep discharge cycles.
 Potential military form factors include the 6T, 2HN, and 4HN as
described in the military specifications MIL-PRF-32143B and
MIL-B-11188H.  Potential military applications would be any commercial
lead acid start battery, such as Group 31, Group 75\/86, Group 78, etc.,
 as defined by Battery Council International. Deliverables would include
 at least 2 batteries for laboratory testing.",

        "topic_name": "Rapid Prediction of Convective Heat Transfer for
Thermal Signature Analysis",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: A rapid modeling algorithm is
required to predict convective heat transfer for military ground vehicle
 thermal and infrared (IR) signature analyses. The convection algorithm
should model flow details at the levels of complexity and accuracy
needed for convective heat transfer predictions and thermal signature
evaluation. The algorithm must be capable of accurately modeling natural
 wind including its turbulent intensity.    DESCRIPTION: Military
vehicle survivability assessments require thermal modeling in order to
achieve performance goals related to the control of thermal infrared
(IR) signatures. Thermal management is the cornerstone of efficient IR
signature control. A key part of the thermal analysis of ground vehicles
 is the prediction of the convection heat transfer caused by wind- and
fan-driven flows, and by natural convection. Existing convection models
are either CFD-based or they model convection using simple formulas. CFD
 solutions typically involve lengthy set-up times due to meshing
requirements, require a high level user expertise, and can have
computational solution times that restrict or prohibit their use in
rapid design cycles or multiple-condition signature analyses. Simple
convection formulas are not an acceptable solution since they can fail
to capture important flow details such as windward flow acceleration,
wake regions, exhaust flow impingement, etc. What is needed is a
convection prediction process that can model the flow details at a
coarse level  at the level needed for convective heat transfer
prediction, and that has none of the user burden usually associated with
 traditional CFD use.    PHASE I: Develop and demonstrate an algorithm
to predict the heat transfer due to wind-based convection on a simple
object. Develop a plan for an advanced algorithm that can be integrated
into an existing military ground vehicle modeling process. The plan must
 address how the convection algorithm will use the geometry description
and property assignments currently made during the setup of the thermal
model for vehicles. The plan must describe the expected changes in the
inputs, operation, and computational speed of the thermal and signature
modeling processes that will be caused by the integration of the
convection algorithm into it.    PHASE II: Develop a convection
algorithm capable of modeling both exterior and interior convection
flows, and demonstrate the algorithm by integrating it into an existing
thermal and IR signature prediction model for a military ground vehicle.
 The demonstration must include an interior flow analysis of an engine
soak condition, a wind-driven exterior flow analysis of a stationary
vehicle, an exterior flow analysis of a moving vehicle, an advection
analysis of the underbody of a vehicle showing the transfer of heat from
 hot components to downstream components, impingement of an exhaust
plume flow, and the channeling of the flow due to wheels and other
underbody flow obstructions. To demonstrate this, multiple vehicle
models may be. The convection algorithm must be validated by comparing
predicted results against measured data or data obtained from CFD
simulations, and by comparing LWIR signature predictions against
measured sensor imagery. The rapid nature of the set-up and solution
time of the algorithm as integrated into the thermal and signature
modeling process must also be demonstrated.    PHASE III: A rapid and
low user-burden approach to including accurate convection modeling can
be transitioned to the thermal design of commercial automotive vehicles
as well as to architecture, aerospace vehicles, HVAC, geothermal energy,
 electronics casing, and to structures and electronics that will be
subjected to extreme weather conditions.",

        "topic_name": "Reliability-Based Design Optimization Software
Package for Broader Simulation-Based Design Applications",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop reliability-based design
optimization (RBDO) techniques and software package for simulation-based
 designs to improve military ground vehicle systems and subsystems.
These techniques are intended to be used for new vehicle designs and for
 changes to existing designs. The techniques should be able to determine
 effect on vehicle life that a particular change would cause. In
addition, the techniques are expected to go beyond durability into other
 areas of vehicle design assessment, such as mobility and survivability.
    DESCRIPTION:  This SBIR project will define, determine, and develop
innovative numerical methods and computational tools for assessing
uncertainty, risk and tradeoffs in vehicle designs and will implement a
reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) of ground vehicle systems
and subsystems for diverse physical applications including
survivability, durability, mobility, fuel efficiency, etc.  To extend
RBDO, which traditionally has focused solely on durability, to broader
applications such as survivability and mobility, it will be necessary to
 develop both sensitivity-based and sampling-based RBDO methods.
Because the focus of this work is the optimization methodology itself,
and not the solvers for the different disciplines, the expected RBDO
solution is one that will allow for the user to modularly plug in their
own solver (referred to here as a"black box") for the discipline being
studied. We will focus initially on a crash safety\/survivability
problem. RBDO problems exhibit a strong parallel nature which requires
large computations, so the proposed RBDO methods need to be mapped to a
multiple core environment in High Performance Computing (HPC) to
increase computational efficiency.  For input random variables such as
material strength parameters or duty cycle roughness, various input
marginal distributions and correlated variables need to be supported.
Also, both random and interval variables need to be supported.  Methods
for modeling input Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and Cumulative
Density Functions (CDFs) from experimental data are necessary for both
marginal and joint distributions. These new techniques should be able to
 handle interval distributions as well as the more traditional
probability distributions.  For sampling based RBDO, accuracy of the
proposed surrogate model must be demonstrated.  Since it is very
expensive to run tests or full physics-based simulations of vehicle
system and subsystems, it is important to minimize the number of samples
 needed by the RBDO solution process, so an efficient sequential
sampling strategy should be implemented.  Also, user generated surrogate
 models need to be supported for reliability analysis and RBDO.  For
sensitivity-based RBDO, in addition to the first-order reliability
method (FORM), a higher-order method (similar to second-order
reliability method (SORM)) needs to be developed for highly nonlinear
RBDO problems.  The proposed RBDO code needs to be easy to integrate
with available commercial\/non-commercial M &amp; S codes via interfaces
 for broader multidisciplinary applications.  For problems with a large
number of potential design variables, to effectively use surrogate
models, a variable screening method should be developed by
mathematically determining the effect of variables on the output
variances and automatically selecting variables that have the most
significant affect on output.  Lack of input model information and
surrogate model uncertainty should be considered for confidence (i.e.,
assure reliability) of optimized designs.  For prediction and evaluation
 of output distributions, a multi-dimensional visualization capability
would be desirable, to allow for human users to appreciate the
variability of the problem and its solution.      PHASE I:  The
contractor shall research, design, and develop a reliability-based
design optimization method and software package for multidisciplinary
ground vehicle applications under input uncertainty.  The contractor
shall demonstrate integration of the RBDO code with
commercial\/non-commercial codes.  The design methodology shall have the
 ability to be mapped on to multiple processors for speedy optimization
process using such standard parallel techniques.  The contractor shall
show a plan for how to integrate the RBDO solver with various"black
box"physics-based simulations in areas such as survivability, mobility
and fuel-efficiency. The key focus for this stage will be crash
safety\/survivability optimization, using a"black box"for the objective
and constraint functions in the optimization. The contractor shall
discuss with the contracting officer"s representative (COR) a case study
 to work in Phase II. Feasibility of key capabilities: independent and
correlated input variables, both sensitivity-based and sampling-based
RBDO methods, random and interval variables, accuracy of surrogate
models, and efficient sequential sampling strategy will be evaluated to
help determine transition to Phase II. In addition, the contractor is
expected to provide an assessment of the scalability of the algorithms
to larger problems and more processors.    PHASE II:  The contractor
shall extend the research and development of the robust optimization
methodology from Phase I into a working"user friendly"software package.
 Tests on various necessary capabilities shall be conducted to
demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and performance of the methodology
 in a variety of conditions. The contractor shall show successful
integration with"black box"simulations in crash safety\/survivability,
an area not normally accommodated by RBDO techniques. In addition to
survivability, it is desired that both mobility and fuel-efficiency can
be handled, but to keep the scope manageable, only the survivability
portion will be demonstrated at this phase. The contractor shall perform
 a case study as agreed to with the COR before the start of this phase.
By the end of Phase II, the software package must be ready to progress
to full commercialization in Phase III. To improve the chances for
successful commercialization, the user interface will be critical at
this stage, and it is expected that a significant portion of the
investment will go to this.    PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  The
RBDO design methodology and software package developed above in the
description can be used in a broad range of military and civilian
applications.  For potential military applications, the RBDO techniques
and software package developed can be used by US Army, USMC, Air Force,
Navy, as well as vehicle OEM"s and DOD suppliers to analyze performances
 and optimize systems of vehicle components for reliability and RBDO of
systems.  Also, via commercialization, civilian applications need to be
promoted. Potential exists for use in the civilian automotive industry
and for other applications. A good user interface and demonstrated
integration with a variety of"black box"simulations are critical metrics
 for success in the marketplace.",

fuel reformer for JP-8 and highway diesel fuel, for use with a
sulfur-tolerant Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) in a compact, 20-kilowatt
(kW) net output system.    DESCRIPTION:  In order for Fuel Cell based
Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) to meet the increasing power demands in the
 limited space claims available on combat and tactical vehicles, further
 development of sulfur-tolerant components is essential.  TARDEC has
developed and will be testing 7-10kW fuel cell based APUs that operate
on JP-8 fuel, the U.S. single battlefield fuel.  These APUs allocate up
to 30% of their volume to hardware that removes sulfur-bearing molecules
 from JP-8 before it is reacted in the fuel reformer.  Without
desulfurized JP-8, the reformer and the fuel cell downstream would be
poisoned.  A sulfur-tolerant reformer would eliminate the need for JP-8
desulfurization, but would convert sulfur in the JP-8 into hydrogen
sulfide (H2S) gas, a fuel cell poison, in the reformate (fuel gas).  To
deal with H2S, it can be absorbed with a compact, effective zinc oxide
filter, a sulfur-tolerant fuel cell can be used, or a combination of the
 two approaches.     This proposal is to develop a sulfur tolerant
reformer capable of supporting a 20kW APU.  Developing a reformer that
does not require sulfur to be removed from the fuel is one of two
essential pieces needed in a sulfur tolerant APU design, the other being
 the fuel cell stack.  TARDEC is currently developing a Sulfur Tolerant
Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stack through an Army SBIR that has successfully
completed Phase 1.  Aligning the sulfur tolerant reformer program to
integrate with the sulfur tolerant stack program has the potential to
deliver the high power density fuel cell APU system that is quiet,
efficient and has reduced system complexity compared to other fuel cell
APU systems and especially conventional engine based APUs.  This
technology has support from both the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and
Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), making it a multi-service program.
    PHASE I:   The contractor shall design a reformer to provide
sufficient flow of reformate gas for a 20kW SOFC, assumed to operate at
40% efficiency at rated power.  The reformate gas delivered to the fuel
cell must have a sulfur content not exceeding 50 parts per million
volume (ppmv) when processing JP-8 with a sulfur content of 3000 parts
per million by weight (ppmw), and it is assumed that gas-phase sulfur
removal will be used to limit sulfur levels in the reformate.  Further,
the reformate must contain less than 40 ppmv of two-carbon or
higher-carbon reforming by-products to deter coke formation in the fuel
cell system.     PHASE II:  The contractor shall build the reformer
designed in Phase I, with automatic controls, and operate it for 2000
hours to demonstrate capability to operate on ultra-low sulfur diesel
(ULSD) fuel and on JP-8 at typical sulfur levels (about 600 ppm) and
maximum sulfur levels while delivering the required reformate quality.
The contractor shall demonstrate through packaging studies how the
reformer would be packaged with a sulfur-resistant SOFC.    PHASE III:
Military uses of the design are the Abrams tank ECP 2 and other future
combat vehicles; power for medium Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and
for special operations all-terrain vehicles. The intended commercial
applications are as a power source for refrigerated semi-trailers, and
as a quiet substitute for mobile diesel generators.  The core
sulfur-resistant reforming technology can be adapted to SOFC power
systems ranging from a few kilowatt to hundreds of kilowatts with
diverse applications in aircraft APUs, recreation vehicles, marine craft
 and ships, that variously use jet fuels, commercial highway diesel
fuel, compressed natural gas and propane.",

        "topic_name": "Adaptive Inter-Cylinder Output Balancing System
(AICOBS)",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Develop an in-vehicle, software
system, for an electronically-controlled diesel engine fuel system, to
adaptively reduce inter-cylinder variability in output, in real-time,
resulting in improved engine output, reliability, and fuel economy.
DESCRIPTION:  All multi-cylinder internal combustion engines exhibit
imbalance in power output between cylinders.  This is due to necessary
hardware design compromises as well as manufacturing variances in engine
 components.  An example of the former is the difference in the length
and shape of intake manifold runners, which can lead to inter-cylinder
variation in mass of air delivered, as well as differences in mixture
motion.  An example of the latter is manufacturing tolerance differences
 in individual fuel injectors, leading to variation in mass of fuel
delivered to each cylinder.    The variation in output between cylinders
 results in uneven acceleration of the crankshaft during each rotation.
 This causes vibration which can lead to accelerated wear and potential
early failure of engine components.  In addition, the secondary effects
of variation in the combustion event within each cylinder are
differences in temperature and pressure of the combustion and exhaust
gases.  If fueling mass and timing are not adjusted for each cylinder
individually, when even one cylinder is approaching a dangerous
operating condition, the output of rest of the cylinders might have to
be maintained at a sub-optimal level, in order to protect the
one"bad"cylinder.  This can mean that the potential for higher output
and\/or better fuel economy for the engine as a whole is being limited.
   One widely-used measure of engine output is Indicated Mean Effective
Pressure (IMEP).  This metric is useful because it enables comparison of
 engines of differing size within a general design class (turbo-diesel,
naturally-aspirated gasoline, etc.)  Variations of 5% to 10% (depending
on operating condition) in IMEP values between cylinders have been noted
 in diesel engines using DF2 fuel.  Even higher variations have been
seen for the same engines running JP8.  The target for this project is
to reduce inter-cylinder imbalance to below 2% under all operating
conditions, regardless of fuel.    In order to mitigate the effect of
this imbalance, manufacturers will sometimes introduce engine control
software calibration settings that vary the mass and timing of fuel
delivered to individual cylinders, under prescribed operating
conditions.  However, when this is done, it is based on measured data
acquired from a limited sample of engines tested on dynamometers.  The
result is a one-size-fits-all approach that remains static in the field,
 and cannot adapt to the variation between individual engines, or all of
 the potential environmental conditions that might be encountered.    An
 alternative approach that has also been tried is to install in-cylinder
 pressure sensors that are capable, with appropriate analysis software,
of quickly and accurately characterizing the combustion event.  This
system is quite capable of finding inter-cylinder imbalance so that it
can be mitigated by uniquely tailoring the fuel delivery to each
cylinder.  Unfortunately, this system is expensive, both at installation
 and in terms of reliability and maintainability.     An approach is
required that can react to variations in inter-cylinder output in
real-time, on the vehicle in the field, and continually adjust engine
fueling parameters to reduce the variation, using only the
instrumentation and electronic control systems installed by the
manufacturer, by developing an intelligent signal processing algorithm,
capable of being implemented in software that can be run in the
manufacturer's engine control module.    PHASE I:  Complete a
feasibility study that should determine the technical and commercial
merit of developing a Adaptive Inter-Cylinder Output Balancing System
(AICOBS).  This effort shall fully develop an initial concept design,
establish programmatic (cost, schedule and performance) goals, and
deliver a final technical report detailing the AICOBSconcept.    This
initial concept must be designed to: 1) be"adaptive", meaning capable of
 reacting to the actual inter-cylinder imbalances being experienced by
the engine (as opposed to being statically calibrated in advance), 2)
be"real-time"meaning the recognition of the imbalance and the corrective
 reaction must occur within a sufficiently short time interval that
inter-cylinder balance is maintained under all expected operating
transients, 3) use only the standard sensors and actuators present in a
typical electronically-controlled fuel system, 4) be capable of being
run in a commercial engine control module along with all of the
manufacturer's other control software, without negatively impacting the
system's capability or throughput.     PHASE II:  This effort will
culminate in two well-developed Adaptive Inter-Cylinder Output Balancing
 System (AICOBS) prototypes.  The first prototype will be fabricated
using the Phase I concept design.  The performance goal for the first
prototype will be 2% variation in IMEP across all cylinders under
steady-state operating conditions.  The second prototype will be
improved through a testing and redesign process.  The performance goal
for the second prototype will be 2% variation in IMEP across all
cylinders under steady-state and transient operating conditions.    1.
Produce a prototype AICOBS based on the Phase I concept design.  2.
Establish actual system performance through physical testing (and
compare the results to the original performance goals), then
document"Lessons Learned".  4. Redesign the Phase I concept while
applying the"Lessons Learned"from performance, testing.  5. Fabricate a
2nd generation AICOBS prototype based on previous redesign applying
the"Lessons Learned"approach.  6. Validate expected performance through
testing (and compare to performance goals).    This effort shall
deliver:  1. Demonstration of Phase I AICOBS concept prototype, after
testing is complete.  2. Demonstration of second generation redesigned
AICOBS prototype after testing is complete.  3. A final technical report
 detailing the 2nd generation redesigned AICOBS prototype.     PHASE
III:  Inter-cylinder balancing is a technology that would provide
enhanced performance, fuel-economy, and reliability in all military
ground vehicles that currently utilize digital electronic control for
fueling.  Most commercial diesel-powered vehicles already utilize
electronic fueling control.  Inter-cylinder balancing has been
researched and tested by the big commercial manufacturers, but has not
been put into production because of the high cost of the in-cylinder
sensor hardware.  This effort envisions a software-only solution, using
sensor hardware that is already installed on commercial vehicles that
feature electronic fuel control.  Commercial vehicles would see the same
 benefits as military vehicles, namely enhanced performance, fuel
economy, and reliability.  These benefits would be realized without the
significant additional expense of additional sensor hardware.",

Interior Trim Energy Absorption Material",
        "description": "OBJECTIVE: To develop flame, smoke, and toxicity
 resistant, recoverable (retains its shape after impact) energy
absorption trim material for use within military vehicle interiors. The
material provides occupant impact protection during blast, crash and
rollover events.     DESCRIPTION: During underbody blast, crash and
rollover events, the vehicle occupant, even when properly restrained
experiences high velocity motion in infinite directions. Blast events in
 particular are, by nature of the infinite possible locations of the
blast initiator (e.g. Improvised Explosive Device), conducive to setting
 the vehicle in a variety of motions. During a blast event the vehicle
is pushed in an upward motion, and is also susceptible to rollover side
to side or end to end depending on the location of the blast initiator
relative to the vehicle location. The intent of the use of interior trim
 energy absorption materials is to select materials designed to absorb
kinetic energy in a controllable and predictable manner, in such a way
as to reduce the level of energy experienced by the vehicle occupant and
 thus reduce occupant injury due to impact. Currently there is little to
 no interior trim energy absorption materials used in the interior of
military vehicles. Additionally, any materials which are used for
military applications are typically validated to FMVSS 302, which is
considered by the TARDEC Flame, smoke and toxicity Interior Team to be
an inferior specification for military vehicle applications. There is a
variety of commercially available energy absorbing material with both
recoverable and non-recoverable characteristics; however the
commercially available materials are not designed with a high level of
resistance to flame, smoke and toxicity. The challenge to the military
vehicle designer is to provide interior trim energy absorbing material
solutions which achieve high energy absorption capabilities, are
recoverable and durable, as well as resistant to flame, smoke and
toxicity. Resistance to flame, excessive smoke and toxicity are
characteristics unique to military vehicle interior applications due to
the vehicle"s exposure to blast events typically from IED"s (Improvised
Explosive Devices). Unlike a commercial automobile, military vehicles
are designed with heavy armor, heavy transparent armor and are
significantly more enclosed. Upon the and underbody blast event, for
which the armor is penetrated and the vehicle interior is exposed to
high heat and\/or flame, the materials inside the vehicle shall resist
FST, to the extent the occupant has sufficient time to evacuate the
vehicle.     PHASE I: Phase I of this effort shall consist of a
feasibility study and concept development of one or more flame, smoke
and toxicity resistant energy absorption material(s) which are capable
of retaining their intended form upon multiple high and low impacts
(high impact using Head Impact Test equipment at 15mph). The feasibility
 study shall describe through an analytical approach the means for which
 the proposed material will be developed to achieve a pass performance
to MIL-STD-2031 and UL-94 for flame, smoke and toxicity resistance. The
study shall also describe what affects the flame smoke and toxicity
resistant formulation may have on the energy absorption, durability, and
 recoverability characteristics of the material. The energy absorption
