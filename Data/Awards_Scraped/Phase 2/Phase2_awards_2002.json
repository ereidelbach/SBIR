        "abstract": "Abstract         This SBIR Phase II proposal describes the design, fabrication and evaluation of a Self-Calibrating Vector Magnetometer (SVM) breadboard model. The SVM is an innovative high-accuracy instrument capable of making both scalar and vector component measurements of Earth and planetary magnetic fields. The SVM scalar mode employs Optically-Driven Spin Precession (OSP) magnetic resonance. An OSP single-cell locked digital oscillator magnetometer was demonstrated for the first time under the Phase I Project achieving 3 pT/root-Hz sensitivity. Laser pumping with optical fiber coupling permits miniaturization of the SVM sensor by reducing helium cell volume by a factor of 8 and placing the laser and IR detector in the Electronic Unit. High-accuracy SVM scalar measurements are used to calibrate the SVM vector measurements thereby eliminating both fluxgate vector magnetometers and the scalar magnetometers required to correct for fluxgate drifts and offsets. The feasibility of fabricating a breadboard model SVM in Phase II has been established under the Phase I Project. By providing scalar measurements with an accuracy better than 1.0 nT, scalar sensitivity of 3 pT/root-Hz, vector component sensitivity of 5 pT/root-Hz, and calibrated accuracy of 1 nT, the SVM offers a significant advance in space magnetometer state of the art.",

As the US Army moves toward weapons systems for the digital battlefield, newer,lighter weight and more capable hardware is emerging. These digital systems may not realize better \"seeing\", that is, situational awareness.  Cognitive task load will be overwhelming if the crew is to interpret and distill the data, deciding what to dofast.  Move and shot - while being shot at.  Well-informed troops will outstrip an ill-formed enemy in a combat environment. It's all about whom gets into firing position first. We propose to assist crews of wheeled and tracked platforms by reducing thetime to assign fires for engagement of the enemy using a multi-role weapon-target pairing algorithm.  Secondly, by \"seeing the terrain and battlefield awareness\", provide each controlled unit a maneuver command for increasing probability of kill whilereducing the unit's vulnerability to enemy fires.  Together, these two functions form the \"Shoot & Scoot Assistant\". We will define an agent architecture that supports component reuse, embedded real-time decision support performance, and conforms to theJoint Technical Architecture-Army.\"",

In Phase I we researched the base theoretical underpinnings for expeditionarylogistics and constructed a convincing autonomic logistics (AL) system prototype (interfaced to a notionally simulated subset of an instrumented vehicle). Motivated by the AL problem for instrumented vehicles, 21CSI would continue the research, design, anddevelopment of EXLOG21. EXLOG21 will assist the CSS logistics planner achieve his mission of generating focused and tailored logistics support to the expeditionary forces within the Area of Operations (AO).  Fully developed, EXLOG21 will make use of ourinnovative hybrid Bayesian Probability networks and Game-Theoretic approach, in order to estimate the failure probabilities of the numerous systems and subsystems down to the component level. The resulting theory and technology will facilitate logisticsand maintenance operations by addressing such practical problems as tradeoff evaluation for onboard sparing and prepostioned replenishments, predictive failure analysis for corrective maintenance actions, and real-time reevaluation and adjustment oflogistics planning packages. 21CSI fully expects this effort to culminate in both a substantial new applied theory and a revolutionary advancement in the way computers are used to solve ship",

Phase II will benchmark the Phase I basic model design with both an in-space flight demonstration test and VAT lifetime testing.

It is the intent that this system would be ready to fly \"as is\" on a demonstration flight, with the caveat that the \"new, streamlined\" flight qualification proceduresfollowed in the Phase II program were both acceptable and appropriate to the mission. This attention to also developing a novel way of getting hardware in flight demonstrations early in the cycle represents a significant departure from the standard flighthardware development sequence. With the intent to identify flight design issues early on in an integrated product development fashion, this approach, while \"out of the box with attendant risks, has potentially widespread payoff beyond this specific VATtechnology.\"",

Theprototype diamond switch module will be enabled by the development of a novel UV flash lamp which will dramatically extend the capability of the Phase I UV laser trigger. The building block nature of the prototype 100 kV/ 1 kA module will allow a widerange of applications to be supported by packaging the modules in various serial and parallel configurations.

The prototype system of tools created in the Phase I is based on the \"paper product\" developed in the R25.  In Phase II we will refine and complete development of the prototype tool created in Phase I.  Specific aims in Phase II are to : (1) produce the functional beta system of tools according to the functional and technical specifications created in Phase I; (2) test the impact of the system of tools in a randomized controlled clinical trial on (a) the primary outcome for which the study is statistically powered, i.e., physical activity; (b) outcomes for diet and smoking patterns; (c) secondary outcomes including stages of change and the quantity and quality of counseling about cancer risk factor reduction provided by health care providers to their patients who have a scheduled return visit within the 3-month study period; (3) assess the degree to which the system of tools was used by patients and providers, and to assess ratings of satisfaction and perceived value by the various stakeholders (i.e., patients, physicians, and potential purchasers); (4) refine and update the preliminary Product Development Plan, and (5) incorporate the completed product into Abacus Technologies' suite of Technology Solutions products and commence product distribution in Phase III.",

Skit-based performances and open discussion are two frequently successful methods of working with children to develop conflict resolution skills. This project is creating a core set of conflict resolution modules along with ongoing new video-scenarios and educational materials that explore various conflict situations, providing these materials directly and over the web into classrooms, and providing a web-based conferencing forum for children to discuss the situations presented in the skits with each other, and with therapists experienced with conflict resolution and the actors playing the characters in the skits, thereby fostering communities among participating classrooms. \r \r The Phase I effort clearly demonstrated feasibility: all milestones were met and significant gains were observed in all aspects of the field trial. Phase II will continue the work effort by completing a set of 6 \"core\" conflict resolution modules, creating an online student and teacher Workshop, and developing an extensive and extensible set of online and hardcopy teacher support materials. \r \r For Phase II, three summative evaluation activities will be conducted as part of the test of feasibility: analysis of (1) the classroom experiences when using the materials. (2) the online dialogue of the student-participants, and (3) the data gathered from a controlled (waitlisted) pre-post design (N=352). 16 classes will participate at the same time across a one-year period. Based on the intermediary and final outcomes of the field trial, the STARstreams will be revised once more prior to delivering to market.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Accurate Automation Corporation has developed a distributed adaptive guidance and control architecture for minimum Delta-V formation flying of satellite constellations. The innovation in this approach is that it is an extremely streamlined solution to a very difficult guidance and control problem. The guidance module of the proposed architecture is built around a simulation of a system of particles whose motion is a result of attractive and repulsive forces generated through simulated potential fields. Desirable characteristics of the guidance system are: 1) that a large number of satellites, starting at some initial conditions, can move amongst themselves to some desired final conditions with a guarantee that undesirable interactions between individual satellites will not occur, 2) that the path taken by each individual satellite can be achieved using minimum Delta-V, and 3) that the guidance system is distributed. In order to guarantee stability for the satellite constellation as a whole, we designed a distributed satellite control module with a specifiable convergence rate. This in combination with our ability to specify the convergence rate of the guidance module, allows us to ensure that each satellite will stay within a certain distance of its commanded path (tracking error has a known bound).",

Successful completion of Phase I studies showed that the UBM-ECM can be configured into a tube shaped device with mechanical and material properties suitable for the repair of esophageal tissue. These studies also showed that primary canine esophageal epithelial cells could attach, proliferate and differentiate in vitro upon the UBM scaffold. Finally, a preliminary study in a dog model demonstrated the ability of the resorbable UBM scaffold to replace native esophageal tissue with host derived tissues that included an intact squamous epithelium, submucosal vascularized collagenous tissue and subjacent bundles of skeletal muscle appropriate for the resected segment of cervical esophagus. The present Phase II SBIR proposal seeks support to pursue the development of the UBM bioscaffold as a device for the repair or replacement of damaged or missing esophageal tissue; a surgical application that currently has very limited options. There are three studies described, each of which addresses a clearly defined specific aim: (1) to determine the fate and mode of degradation of the porcine derived UBM scaffold when used as an esophageal repair device in a dog model; (2) to complete ISO-9001 testing as a prerequisite to regulatory submission of an Investigational Device Exemption (DE); and (3) to examine the safety and efficacy of the UBM device in a definitive chronic study using an animal model. The work will be conducted by an experienced interdisciplinary group of investigators and will combine the expertise of ACell's professional staff, the certified laboratories of the North America Science Associates (NamSA), and a university partner. A timeline for completion of the studies, clearly defined criteria for success, and plans for subsequent Phase III work are included in this Phase II proposal.",

Due to the popularity of fiber-optic sensors, it is proposed to incorporate fiber-optic sensors into the current SMART Layer product to create a Hybrid piezoelectric/fiber-optic monitoring layer. The specific objectives of the phase I effort were to (1) Develop and fabricate a hybrid piezoelectric/fiber optic layer, (2) Integrate the fabricated prototype onto a demonstration structure and (3) Demonstrate functionality of the structurally integrated HyPFO monitoring layer. Anticipated phase II challenges include completing the design and development of the Hybrid piezoelectric/fiber-optic sensor layer, development of instrumentation for the hybrid layer in collaboration with fiber-optic companies, integration of the fiber-optic instrument and Acellent's current diagnostic instrument, development of diagnostic and application software for the HyPFO and testing and validation of the developed system with industrial partners.",

Approximately 750,000 people suffer a stroke each year and over 80% of these are ischemic. Yet only 1% of this number receives medical treatment such as TPA that is known to dissolve clots and promote favorable outcome if administered within 3 hours of onset. Among the many causes of this serious health and ultimately economic problem is the inability to rapidly differentiate ischemic from hemorrhagic strokes to allow intervention. The device is a small non-invasive system that measures the acoustic signature of the brain and compares it with the patient's arterial waveform. Active Signal will add code to calculate those signal features identified in Phase I as indicative of the patient's stroke condition, and the team will clinically test on 200 patients the hypotheses for stroke identification determined in Phase I.  The system will be miniaturized for EMS units to use at the scene of injury. This would significantly increase the percentage of ischemic stroke patients who would receive time-sensitive therapies, reducing disability and medical costs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating mental disorder that results in a progressive loss of cognitive functions. However, there is no effective treatment for this disease. The neurotoxin AB peptide plays a central role in AD, involving increased production and accumulation of AB in brain amyloid plaques. Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is required to generate AB, which requires B-secretase cleavage of APP to produce AB. Strong evidence indicates that inhibitors of B-secretase should block AB production and be an effective treatment for AD. The key to drug screening for inhibitors of 8-secretase is a rapid high throughput formatted assay for authentic 3-secretase activity obtained from a natural, in vivo tissue source, with a complementary cell-based assay from the same in vivo tissue source. In the phase I grant period, endogenous B-secretase secretase activity was identified in isolated chromaffin vesicles (secretory vesicles) of neuronal chromaffin cells. These isolated vesicles contain all the known components required for production of AB consisting of APP, AB(1-40), B-secretase activity, BACE 1, and presenilin; these vesicles, therefore, provide an ideal model system for screening inhibitors of B-secretase. The Phase I grant developed the chromaffin vesicle system into two assays for screening inhibitors of B-secretase and AB production: (I) sensitive and rapid high throughput in vitro assays of authentic B-secretase activity, and (2) chromaffin cell-based assays to assess effects of inhibitors on cellular AB production. This Phase II proposal will use these assays to screen structurally diverse and focused combinatorial libraries for compounds that selectively inhibit B-secretase activity and AB production. Drug \"hits\" from these assays will be tested in initial animal toxicology studies for safety and pharmacokinetic properties, and in preliminary studies for reduction of AB in a transgenic mouse model of AD. This phase II project will, thus, provide lead compounds for B-secretase inhibitors that will be developed with pharmaceutical partners for new drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65657     Coal-fired power plants represent the single largest source of mercury emissions to the atmosphere, and the EPA has announced its intent to regulate the emission of mercury from these plants in 2007.  Estimates by EPA and others predict that the annual cost of controlling 90% of current mercury emissions will be $2-5 billion.  This estimate is based on the injection of activated carbon, which acts as a sorbent to the collect the gas-phase mercury.  This project will develop a new family of sorbents consisting of chemically amended silicates, materials that have shown a remarkable capacity for mercury, leading to a 35% cost reduction over the use of activated carbon in the removal of mercury from coal-fired flue gas.  In particular, the mercury capacity of the new sorbent will be maximized, and the cost per pound of mercury removed from the flue gas will be minimized.  In Phase I, ten different sorbent formulations were prepared and tested in a simulated flue gas stream.  Two amendment chemistries and one silicate substrate showed significant capacity advantages over the others.  The new sorbent was also mixed with fly ash and tested as a concrete additive.  In contrast to activated carbon, which requires fly ash to be landfilled rather than sold as a byproduct, the fly ash/sorbent blend was shown to have a beneficial effect when added to concrete.  In Phase II, the process to prepare sorbent in uniform batches will be improved, so that performance can be predicted by process parameters.  The new sorbent will be tested in flue gas from a laboratory coal combustor and in a slipstream from an operating power plant, over a range of gas compositions and temperatures.  Lastly, cost models will be prepared for the full-scale use of the sorbent in a power plant.                Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to the anticipated market of $2-5 billion for power plant mercury control, the sorbent should find use as a drop-in replacement for activated carbon wherever it is used as a mercury sorbent.  Its use would allow utilities to continue to sell fly ash for use as a pozzolan, saving billions of dollars.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: (provided by the applicant) Surveys conducted by municipal wastewater treatment plants across the country have concluded that 10 percent to over 70 percent of the mercury reaching the plants comes from dental offices. These findings, combined with increasingly stringent regulations on mercury discharges, have placed pressure on the dental profession to reduce their discharges of mercury-bearing amalgam.  The objective of this project is to enhance the performance of sedimentation-type amalgam separators by controlling the water chemistry within the separator. Dental wastewater contains mercury in three general forms: large particles of amalgam, fine particles of amalgam, and dissolved mercury. Simple sedimentation traps can capture the large particles and many of the fine particles. However, colloidal particles and dissolved mercury can still exceed discharge limits. At present, expensive and maintenance-intensive adsorbents are needed to achieve discharge concentrations in the low-ppb range. During Phase I ADA Technologies showed that safe, inexpensive additives could be used within a sedimentation device to minimize the release of dissolved mercury. In Phase II, we intend to document the effective use of optimized versions of these additives at several dental clinics, demonstrating ppb-level mercury concentrations at costs significantly below those for adsorbent-based processes.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: US dentists use some 45 tons of mercury per year for new amalgam fillings.  European, Canadian, and some US municipalities limit dental office discharges of mercury.  New regulations are pending across North America. Successful completion of this project would yield a low-cost, field-proven amalgam trap, capable of reducing mercury in dental wastewater to the low parts-per-billion range.  ADA Technologies will utilize its network of partners and experience in dental waste treatment and equipment manufacturing to bring this enhanced trap rapidly to the marketplace.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Thousands of children and adults in the U.S. suffer from upper-limb deficiencies. Current state-of-the-art prehensors intended to increase upper-limb function do not serve this population well. This Phase II SBIR project addresses that situation by focusing upon optimizing a body-powered voluntary-closing (VC) prehensor offering variable mechanical advantage (VMA) and passive holding-assist. Extensive Phase I laboratory testing and field trials with amputee volunteers has established the devices technical feasibility and potential cost-effectiveness. The overall goal of this multi-phase project is to make a next-generation prehensor available to individuals of all ages for whom existing devices are unsuitable or otherwise unsatisfactory. Practical VC prehensors have long been desired for their natural and intuitive operation that promotes proprioception. However, engineering difficulties have prevented the realization of such designs. The device being developed under this project overcomes those technical barriers. In Phase II, units for adult and child use will be designed and fabricated. They will incorporate the comprehensive feedback from experts, amputees, and prosthetists obtained during Phases I and II. Manufacturing processes will be established, and extensive testing and volunteer field trials will be carried out to confirm that the devices perform as required. Educational user materials will also be prepared and evaluated.",

Acute ischemic renal failure affects 5 percent of hospitalized patients and has a mortality rate approaching 50 percent. At present, dialysis is the only FDA-approved treatment for acute renal failure. lschemia-reperfusion injury at the time of kidney transplantation causes delayed graft function and shortens graft survival. The long-term goal of this project is to evaluate the ability of a proprietary A2A adenosine receptor (A2A-AR) agonist, ATL146e to reduce renal injury in humans. The current proposal aims at completing the preclinical characterization of ATL 146e, a potent and selective A2A-AR agonist that has optimum pharmacological characteristics. Aim I addresses FDA requirements for toxicology, pharmacokinetics and metabolism. Aim 2 devises more efficient synthetic methods so that scale-up can support expanded preclinical studies and guide synthesis by certified Good Manufacturing Practices to support human studies. Aim 3 develops an in vivo assay for ATL 146e-mediated anti-inflammatory activity. Aim 4 tests the efficacy of ATL 146e in reducing injury in model of acute ischemia-reperfusion associated with kidney transplantation.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The incidence of azotemia, which includes all cases of   acute renal failure (volume depletion, obstruction and intrinsic causes such as ischemia and toxins), was estimated in 1997 to be 275,000 patients per year.  Additionally, it is estimated that all cases of azotemia are increasing at rate of 16,000 patients/year. The goal of this research is to develop a pharmaceutical product which will address this unmet medical need. All of the specific aims in this project are required by the FDA and ICH for drug development.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central goal of this research is to         develop a new drug to prevent spinal cord reperfusion injury secondary to            aortic clamping that occurs frequently during thoracic surgery. Irreversible         spinal cord injury resulting in paraplegia or paraparesis is the single most         devastating complication of surgery on the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta.      Surgical series have documented permanent spinal cord dysfunction in 15 to 38        percent of high-risk patients. We have synthesized and begun to evaluate a drug      candidate, ATL146e that substantially inhibits spinal cord injury in rabbits.        We have established in preliminary studies that this model is reproducible and       that ATL146e is a potent and selective agonist of recombinant human A2A              adenosine receptors. Aim 1 of the phase 1 proposal is designed to further            characterize the time window and dose of ATL1 46e that is required to produce        optimal spinal cord protection. Aim 2 is designed to develop a new synthetic         scheme that will permit scale up the synthesis of ATL146e. Stability studies         will be initiated to evaluate the shelf life of the active ingredient and            formulations. These studies will facilitate the development of ATL146e as a          drug and will prepare us for the experiments described in the phase II SBIR          proposal.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Paralysis is a devastating complication of aortic reconstruction. In porcine and rabbit models of thoracic aortic surgery, systemic administration of an adenosine analogue, ATL-146e, during spinal cord reperfusion preserved neuronal viability and spinal cord function. The commerical applications of this research are development of ATL-146e or more optimal compounds into therapeutic drugs for administration during thoracic aortic surgeries. Development of such a drug would address an unmet medical need.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The AccuNurse System has been successfully developed in Phase I to provide an easy-to-use \"mentor\" and communications tool for CNAs and nurses in skilled nursing units. Wireless and advanced speech technologies are merged into a conversational system that provides: individualized resident information, paperless documentation at the point of care, and many other features that improve quality of care. \r \r The system works as follows: A nurse enters the CNA care plans on a host computer, with simple screens that require mouse clicks. The CNAs and nurses then have wireless access to this information, in spoken form, by wearing a cordless telephone and headset. All they need to do is speak into the headset to (a) access care plan information, (b) report a completed activity, (c) record a clinical note, (d) record weight, vital signs and input/output at the point of care, and (d) locate and speak with another staff member. They also can listen to an incoming scheduled reminder from AccuNurse such as patient repositioning. \r \r The overall aim of the Phase 2 study is to establish the commercial viability of an enhanced AccuNurse system in skilled nursing units on all three shifts, 7 days a week. The system will be tested at two continuing care retirement communities for 12 months, by full-time, part-time, and temporary, staff. We plan to enhance the AccuNurse system based on the results of Phase 1, customize the messages to meet each facility's needs, and develop an interface with each facility's information system (including care plans and MDS). The Phase 2 project team includes all the Phase 1 participants plus Kendal Corporation, a leader in elder care with 8 continuing care retirement communities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Electrostatic discharge control is vital for the health of any spacecraft. Exposure to charged particles in a space enviroment can lead to large charge differences across the craft, that, if no mechanism for controlled discharge is present, can destroy mission critical equipment. The preferred way of ESD control is to use conducting thermal control coatings. These coatings combine the ability to regulate the thermal balance of a spacecraft with charge mitigation along the whole surface. Adherent Technologies Inc. has developed a new series of conductive binders with excellent thermal control properties. NASA?s JPL has confirmed a solar absorbance of only 0.175, which is 20% better then currently deployed conductive coatings. The material is easy to apply and is, by it?s chemical nature, much more resistant to the space environment then other organic materials. The Phase II program will further improve on the application properties, expose the coatings to a simulated space environment for an extended period of time, and provide sufficient material for full scale testing.",

In Phase I, we reported oninterlaminar failure criteria and modes, based on fracture mechanics.  A damage-dependent bilinear cohesive element is used to capture the crack initiation, propagation, and arrest, while accounting for inertial effects.  An algorithm was developed tocompute essential toughness parameters (strain energy release rate G, stress intensity factor K) and the variations thereof, with crack length and adhesive effects.  Experimental testing of double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens at various stroke rates,using an electronic circuit to measure crack-opening displacement, yielded data which enabled the calculation of material parameters used in the explicit CVFE/LS-DYNA formulation.  As the next step, we propose to develop rate-dependent cohesive elements,and use this technique to analyze mixed-mode failure in stitched, z-pinned and other joint types.  We shall investigate and incorporate contact-impact algorithms in LS-DYNA with filtering and damping.  Experimental work will focus on hydrodynamic pulsetests, using the impact machine developed at the 46th test wing, thus simulating high-rate fracture dynamical scenarios.

The challenge of thesesystems is the thousands of feet of hardwiring to sensor and control inputs.  The Phase I effort resulted in a working, wireless software demonstration of the concept and demonstrated that a Wireless PLC architecture utilizing an Open ControllerArchitecture consisting of a Scanner and Controller Module is a viable, logical approach to achieving the stated project goals: (1) universal plug-n-play, (2) low-cost, and (3) compatibility with existing legacy PLC systems.  The final product hardwarewill consist of two elements: (1) A dedicated self-contained, wireless Scanner Module that directly interfaces to actuators and sensors in place of the PLC, and (2) a wireless Controller Card capable of implementing an interface to an off-the-shelf PLCthrough standard manufacturing network protocols such as WorldFIP, Profibus, DeviceNET, Modbus, etc.  The opportunities are: Decreased amount of cable, Reduced number of cable drops, Decreased numbers of PLC's, Faster installation and setup, Greatlyreduced sensor installation cost, Quicker system debug/fault isolation, and Decreased installation issues associated with shipboard systems.\"",

Advanced multi-layer circuit fabrication techniques incorporating blind and through-hole UV laser drilled micro-via arrays, will be utilized, increasing the number of channels and density over current generation electrodes. These arrays will exhibit significantly improved performance over current generation electrode arrays, which are made using laborious hand fabrication techniques and have limited numbers of channels. Recent developments in processor and implantation techniques demonstrate that field steering methods combined with closer placement of the array to the modilar wall in the cochlea can reduce channel interaction, motivating increasing the number of independent channels in such devices to improve performance. These arrays will support advanced processing strategies including field steering techniques and parallel, high rate, phase coherent stimulation being developed by Advanced Cochlear Systems. The new arrays combined with new processing technologies and greater pulse delivery rates made possible by field control and electrode placement may permit the delivery of two to three orders of magnitude greater information than is provided by available cochlear implant systems.",

It combines two innovative FISH probes: \"SubTelomeric\" (STFISH)        and \"Multiplex\" (MFISH), with sophisticated image analysis, for screening            patients developmental disabilities.                                                                                                                                      During the Phase I project, we evaluated the feasibility of (1) performing           automated identification of chromosome metaphases, and (2) using sophisticated       image analysis for accurate detection of submicroscopic rearrangements. We also      compared the efficiency and precision of the two FISH techniques for cryptic         rearrangement detection. We analyzed 8 samples using STFISH, and 6 samples           using MFISH. Our experimental results show that, the use of STFISH probes            ranging in size from 300Kbp to 30Mbp, permitted the delineation of chromosomal       rearrangements in 8/10 samples. The remaining 2 samples were considered              half-cryptic, since the Subtelomeric probe set does not contain a chromosome         specific probe for the p-arm of chromosome 22. Therefore, the satellites from        22p could not be identified with the telomere probe set. The MFISH assay was         effective in detecting chromosomal rearrangements in 3/6 cases of which 2 were       half-cryptic, and one had a 3-way rearrangement, including a 5Mbp insertion. We      developed software components for an automated system, including auto focusing,      slide scanning for 24 well slides (CytocellTM), and metaphase finding. Finally,      we estimated the cost and time savings achievable, by the addition of improved       imaging methods to both the FISH techniques.                                                                                                                              In Phase II, we will further develop the technology and test it in a clinical        environment. Specifically, for MFISH we will optimize the software for enhanced      performance in detecting rearrangements. For STFISH, we will (1) determine the       scanning and metaphase finding rates of the automated system, (2) test the           prototype in a clinical environment; and (3) evaluate the commercial                 feasibility of the instrument.

An electron gun with greater than 1 nC per bunch and less than 1 p mm-mrad normalized transverse rms emittance would meet this need, but the sub 1 p mm-mrad target remains elusive.  Because axisymmetry has been shown to be important for minimizing emittance growth, this project will develop an axisymmetric electron gun that optimizes the standard emittance-compensation technique to break the 1 p emittance barrier.  Phase I developed a suitable radio frequency (RF) design that provides all necessary features of this novel gun concept.  Beam dynamics calculations showed that the subject electron gun would provide enhanced performance over existing designs.  Phase II will complete the RF design of the axisymmetric, emittance-compensated gun and design and fabricate a prototype device.  The prototype gun will then be tested at high RF powers and the quality of the generated electron beam will be measured.                     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The electron gun should serve as the injector for advanced, high-brightness X-ray sources for both medical and protein crystallography applications.

        "abstract": "Abstract         65805      High rate energy storage devices, such as ultracapacitors, are a critical enabling technology for hybrid electric vehicles (HEV).  The best electrode materials for use in electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) possess three characteristics: (1) high surface area; (2) high electrical conductivity; and (3) surface area easily accessible by electrolyte.  While ruthenium-based ultracapacitors exhibit almost ideal characteristics, the ruthenium was found to be too expensive for the large-scale manufacture of ultracapacitors.  As an alternative, specialty carbon materials could satisfy these characteristics at reasonably low cost, provided that the pore-size distribution could be controlled.  This project will develop high-performance carbon materials for ultracapacitors, using a proprietary carbon manufacturing technique that would ensure good control over the critical characteristics.  Phase I demonstrated that the proprietary carbon material exhibited a capacitance per unit weight of ~100-200 F/g, up to ~30% better than the capacitance of the best cabon-fiber electrodes currently used.  On a per-unit-volume basis, the electrodes were 3-4 times better than the reference electrodes.  A preliminary economic analysis indicated cost reductions 4-10 times lower.  In Phase II, an extensive parametric study will be performed with the purpose of optimizing ultracapacitor performance and cost.  In addition, a series of prototype HEV ultracapacitors will be constructed and evaluated.             Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A robust, versatile technique for manufacturing inexpensive, high-performance carbon ultracapacitors should have primary applications in hybrid power systems for electric cars and in fuel cells.  Additional applications include high rate, short pulse delivery of large charges (such as pulsed lasers); power-supply low-frequency smoothing; and a variety of military, medical (defibrillators), telecommunications, and computer systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In this research project, Advanced Fuel Research, Inc., addresses two important environmental problems: (1) removal and recovery of mercury from combustion/incineration flue gas, and (2) reprocessing of waste tires into value-added products. Coal combustion and incineration of municipal and hazardous wastes results in air pollution due to emissions of trace amounts of heavy metals. Because of the high toxicity of these species, their emissions are or will be regulated. The high volatility of mercury makes control of this metal particularly difficult. Scrap tires present formidable disposal problems, as they are known to be immune to biological degradation. The proposed approach is based on mercury adsorption on low-cost, sulfur-rich activated carbons derived from scrap tires. The sulfur added to tire rubber in the process of vulcanization makes the tire-derived sorbents particularly effective in mercury removal due to the high chemical affinity between mercury and sulfur. Two possible implementations of the process are envisaged: (1) sorbent injection into the flue-gas duct (near-term applications), and (2) a patented regenerative scheme (long-term applications). The overall objective of the project is to develop a novel and effective technology for mercury control using sorbents derived from waste tires. The objective of the Phase I project was to demonstrate the superior price-performance characteristics for waste tire-derived activated carbons under simulated industrial conditions, which was successfully accomplished. The Phase II objective is to optimize sorbent properties as a function of carbon-preparation conditions, and to advance the product to pilot scale (Phase II Option). This will be accomplished through the following tasks: (1) sorbent optimization, (2) sorbent performance, (3) product evaluation, and (4) pilot-scale testing (Phase II Option).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The proposed project will create a novel system for using medical instruments in a wireless network. A unique, highly innovative system architecture is proposed. This work is made possible by the new low-cost wireless networking technology called Bluetooth. Bluetooth makes it commercially feasible for low-cost portable devices to be connected in a true wireless network. This enabling technology will have a long-term impact on future medical systems. By adding Bluetooth wireless connectivity to standard medical instruments such as a pulse oximeter, electrocardiograph, or blood pressure monitor, a highly flexible medical data acquisition system can be constructed for managing medical data in the clinic, small doctors office, emergency medical, or homecare environments. Such a system will lower costs, improve safety, and make possible new monitoring modalities. The proposed innovation is highly relevant to space medicine and health care systems since many of the improvements address the specific needs of remote diagnosis and treatment. In phase II the software architecture and Bluetooth enabled medical instruments will be developed and integrated into an existing commercially successful medical system. FDA approval will be obtained and a new commercial system will resultcommercial production.",

A self-discovering local wireless network is a communications scheme in which devices within a certain area establish connections to one another without requiring user intervention. A production prototype diagnostic electrocardiograph system will be developed in phase II with application software written to utilize the new SmartPhones (cellular phones with a Palm OS) that will soon be available from multiple vendors. The developed technology can be easily adapted to other emergency medical devices such as multi-function modules or AEDs. The developed electrocardiograph will support the transfer of critical pre-hospital data to, for example, an emergency room or remotely located cardiologist. The cardiologist in this example will then have support for the reperfusion therapy decision via immediate access to the patient's 12 lead ECG. All necessary testing for regulatory approval and commercial qualification will be completed during Phase II to allow the system to be produced for human field studies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project concerns the processing and analysis of time-lapse seismic data on parallel computers, using the Internet to control the processing flow and visualize the results.  In recent years, there has been exponential growth in time-lapse seismic project activity.  Time-lapse seismic analysis facilitates the management of oil and gas reservoirs by imaging fluid movement in the reservoir over time.  The results are used to guide reservoir management decisions-such as where to place a new well or where to inject water, gas, or steam to stimulate hydrocarbon movement-and help maximize the life of both new and existing fields while minimizing recovery costs.  The computer algorithms needed to process time-lapse seismic data are complex and require advanced computational hardware-typically multiprocessor Unix workstations or clusters of personal computers-that many potential customers do not have.  The proposed innovation will allow customers to process their data on a centralized PC cluster, using the Internet to control the processing and to visualize the results remotely.  The proposed innovation will improve the links between the components of the time-lapse seismic workflow, leading to greater understanding and more widespread commercial acceptance of the technology.\r \r Potential applications of the research proposed by Fourth Wave Imaging include petroleum industry mapping of by passed oil, monitoring of costly injected fluids, and imaging flow compartmentalization and the hydraulic properties of faults and fractures.  Non-petroleum applications include monitoring groundwater reserves, subsurface monitoring of contaminant plumes and environmental clean-up projects.  The web-based parallel software system developed for this project could be applied to other computer-intensive fields such as earthquake seismology and medical and satellite imaging.  Tools from this web-based software platform such as those for modeling rock physics and seismic data may also be useful for educational purposes.",

The aluminum/water reaction is highly energetic(15kj/g aluminum) and affords the opportunity to use surroundingseawater as the oxidizer such that the energy output exceedspresent explosive driven buoy systems. APTI has significantexperience combusting aluminum and water and has demonstratedthis combustion technique using solid aluminum wire, water, andbattery to generate presssures in excess of 50 kpsi to acclerateprojectiles.BENEFITS: The immediate benefit of this program is to provide the Navy with a substantially safer and less expensive inventory of anti-submarine warfare sonobuoys. Present systems contain high-explosives that require special handling and careto both manufacture and deploy. The proposed concept will eliminate those explosives",

The injection of water and liquid oxidizer such as liquid oxygencan be used to enhance the performance of these engines so that they may power the reusable air-breathing first stage of a space access vehicle.  The fluid injected into the inlet may serve three purposes.  First, it can cool the air entering thecompressor so that the engine may be operated to higher flight Mach number.  Second, it can increase the net mass flow through the inlet so that the engine can generate more thrust.  Third, it can provide additional oxidizer so that additional fuel can beadded in the engine afterburner further augmenting the engine thrust.  It is anticipated that the coolant injected upstream of the compressor may be vaporized before entering the compressor face.  This minimizes the effect of the coolant injection systemon the engine operation thereby simplifying the development effort.\"",

The concept is based on previouslydemonstrated means for creating high mixing rate regions using multiplediscrete axial vortices in the flow. This injector-mixer-flameholdershows promise for emissions reduction by ensuring rapid and complete,well controlled mixing. Another goal is an axial-vorticity fuelinjection, mixing, and flame stabilization design that passivelycontrols combustion instability and flashback by making the combustionregion insensitive to axial flow oscillations. During previous work APRIhas demonstrated the ability to stabilize flames in a geometry designedto provide open three-dimensional separations. In the Phase I effort theability to control mixing rates in geometry directly suitable to gasturbine combustors was demonstrated. Conceptual designs for combustorsbased on this technology are presented.

This project will develop x-ray diagnostics to provide a rapid means of measuring film composition and crystalline texture on-line.  In Phase I, a diffraction method was successfully demonstrated for rapidly measuring a texture parameter of the superconducting film, which was correlated with its ability to conduct high currents.  In addition, a study of x-ray fluorescence from sample films suggested two alternate approaches for achieving high-sensitivity measurements of elemental composition.  In Phase II, prototype diffraction and fluorescence instruments will be tested at facilities that are involved in the development of commercial manufacturing processes for high temperature superconductors.

Much progress has been made in the development of thin film CIGS and amorphous silicon PV devices, however their integration into a solar array system has lagged. As these PV devices have evolved, ABLE has spent a significant amount of effort in developing many ultra?lightweight solar array systems that can take advantage of the lightweight PV devices. One of these systems is ABLEs UltraFlex solar array which forms the basis of this proposed effort. Recent internal studies have indicated that an UltraFlex solar array system populated with 10% efficient thin film PV represents a near term solution that can demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of array mass (>300 w/kg BOL, >600 w/kg with 20% efficient devices), cost (order of magnitude reduction) and stowed volume (<20% of a conventional planar array). The objective of this proposed Phase 1 proposal is to integrate thin film PV to the proven UltraFlex structure in an effort to demonstrate these outstanding performance values.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In SAR and radar interferometric altimeter instruments, the transmit / receiving antennas are separated as far apart as possible to increase resolution in the signal. This requires a stiff and dimensionally stable deployable mast to provide the necessary length between the two radar antennas. Deployable mast length is constrained by available stowage volume, spacecraft platform attitude control constraints (such as deployed frequency) and the requirement for high stability under on-orbit thermal environments and accelerations. AEC-ABLE has developed the ADAM (ABLE Deployable Articulated Mast) as an innovative solution for providing this deployable and extremely stable structure. ABLE has also developed a novel ADAM variation (the stiff-soft design) that uses stiff rods as one set of diagonals in the face of each bay of the mast. These stiff rods have the benefit of greatly increasing shear and torsional stiffness of the mast as well as having low CTE relative to metallic cables, which are the conventional soft diagonals used for the ADAM.

These systems can be used as effective countermeasures against optical sensors.  Military sensorssusceptible to this type of countermeasure are mounted on certain types of infrared guided missiles, aircraft systems for guidance and reconnaissance, and guided munitions.  Such countermeasures can also be effective against personnel in the field.  Amethod of fast filtering to provide a blocking of the in-band countermeasure signal is needed in these systems which will allow the quick return to operation and thus preventing damage to vital focal plane systems.  Recent results in the development ofphotonic bandgap (PBG) technologies have shown that optical structures can be designed that provide variable broadband filtering of light.  We propose to develop a fast filtering system for sensor protection based on PBG filters combined with MEMSactuators for sensor protection.\"",

NASA?s civil tiltrotor web page). Rotary-wing vehicles proposed for improved system capacity must meet global civil aviation requirements for safety, efficiency, and affordability. Many advances have been made in measuring characteristics of rotary-wing vehicles; however, measurements of dynamic, unsteady, and cross-coupling effects are still challenges posing impediments to rapid design cycles. An innovative method, accurately collecting such measurements, utilizes water as a medium for dynamic testing. This testing technique circumvents many of the problems presented by testing in air and provides better insight into the fluid mechanics, interactions and interferences. The method allows testing in slow motion, separates model and test support frequencies, greatly improves signal-to-noise ratios, and provides unparalleled flow visualization. Water tunnel testing will predict maneuvering aerodynamics and stability parameters early in the design cycle, reducing the development time, risk, and cost of new rotorcraft. The method also applies to high performance aircraft development.",

AeroAstro has explored one conceptual application of this technology with the use of an aerobrake to perform orbit transfers.  The Small Payload ORbit Transfer (SPORTTM) vehicle, also being developed by AeroAstro, is capable of taking a smallspacecraft from GTO to a wide range of low Earth orbits by making use of aerobrake technology.The ultimate objective of the proposed Phase II SBIR is to demonstrate the capabilities and potential of large lightweight space structures by designing and implementing a deployable aerobrake device.

This is important in understanding air quality, aerosol formation, visibility, and the impact of energy production and usage on global climate change.  This project will develop a compact tunable infrared laser differential absorption spectrometer.  Based on recent advances in room temperature pulsed quantum cascade lasers, it will greatly improve the sensitivity of real-time airborne measurements for the detection of ammonia and nitric acid at the 10 parts-per-trillion level.  In Phase I, detection limits for atmospheric ammonia and nitric oxide, as a surrogate for nitric acid, were demonstrated using Peltier-cooled pulsed quantum cascade lasers at sub-part-per-billion mixing ratios.  Measurements of laser line width as a function of electrical pulse shape were combined with a model of thermal heat flow in the laser junction and used to implement an improved pulse driver circuit that will minimize line width and improve detection sensitivity.  A siloxyl-coated sampling cell and glass inlet were demonstrated, which minimize surface artifacts when sampling ammonia from the atmosphere.  Phase II will design, build, and test a prototype instrument employing multiple quantum cascade lasers for detection of up to four gases simultaneously.                Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A sensitive, cryogen-free, mid-infrared absorption method for atmospheric trace gas detection should have wide benefits for environmental research, medical diagnostics, and industrial process monitoring of gaseous compounds.  Examples include air pollution monitoring, breath analysis, combustion exhaust diagnostics, and plasma diagnostics for semi-conductor fabrication.",

In Phase I, we performed a preliminary design for a HySPAR sensor suitable for both airborne and ground-based applications. The design is compact and offers the advantages of single snapshot spectro-polarimetry over a 120 degree field-of-view with no moving parts. The simplicity of the design should allow a cost effective implementation even if built in small quantities (>10 units). We performed experiments with our prototype sensor and two co-located sensors, an Aerosol Mass Spectrometer, and a robotic sunphotometer belonging to NASA's AERONET network, yielding good correlation. Using NASA/GISS forward atmospheric modeling codes, we ascertained that the spectral variability of polarized albedos is compatible with our straightforward Stokes inversion method which we demonstrated on sky radiance data measured using our prototype sensor.

The intensity and spectral band shape of leaf chlorophyll fluorescence in green plants has been linked to the physiological status of the plants and thus provides a good indicator of plant health. The proposed sensor will measure the relative intensity of plant fluorescence in two wavelength bands corresponding to emission from Photosystems I and II. The compact size (1000 cm3), light weight (3 kg) and low power consumption (15 watts) of the sensor make this instrument ideal for robotic operation in confined spaces such as might be found on manned space missions or on ground-based facilities such as Bio-PLEX. Use of a novel active fluorescence stimulation source and compact detector enables the device to remotely sense plant fluorescence (at the single leaf, whole plant, or canopy level) from a distance of at least several feet without using a large, high power laser and large focusing optics. With the use of a synchronous detection scheme, the sensor can also efficiently detect the fluorescence in the presence of either solar or artificial lighting.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         To assess the effectiveness of new controls, new measurement techniques are needed to measure emissions from in-use diesel vehicles. The goal of this project is to develop a portable remote sensing instrument for particulate matter (PM) and gaseous pollutants. Aerodyne Research, Inc., already has developed a dual-wavelength tunable infrared laser absorption instrument for the crossroad remote sensing of CO, NO, and CO2 for indexing emissions to fuel consumption. This existing remote sensing instrument allows for longer range and more sensitive measurements than conventional, nondispersive instruments. Aerodyne Research, Inc., is developing a remote sensing device for particulate emissions by extending its gaseous pollutant laser instrument designs. This novel approach probes the exhaust plume with several coaligned laser beams that have a range of wavelengths from mid-infrared to visible. All of the beams sample the same absorption path, simultaneously measuring the column density of soot and gaseous pollutants. Multiple wavelength opacity is used to determine the mass density of soot. Multiple wavelengths yield a more precise measurement of opacity, and hence, more accurate soot density. Multiple wavelength measurement also has the potential to distinguish changes in particle characteristics with varying engine state. During Phase I, both theoretical and experimental investigations were conducted to determine the practicality of multiwavelength opacity measurements for the remote sensing of diesel soot. A prototype instrument that remotely measures opacity at three wavelengths simultaneously with CO2 at a data rate of 25 Hz was assembled and tested. This instrument has been tested in the laboratory and outside the laboratory, including measurements of plumes of passing automobiles and a diesel fuel pool fire. The results were highly successful and encouraging. The instrument demonstrated sufficient sensitivity to measure soot densities at current fleet average emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles. Simultaneously, CO2 was measured with a noise level of 25 ppm-m.In Phase II, Aerodyne Research, Inc., will build new instrumentation that employs the multiple wavelength particulate system. This instrumentation will be extended to include more wavelengths, and possibly will include scatter information for particle sizing. Quantum cascade lasers will be used for the mid-infrared spectroscopic measurement of gaseous pollutants, allowing for a noncryogenic system. The integration of these techniques into one instrument will provide a powerful tool for survey measurements of both PM and NOx emissions of heavy-duty diesel engines in real-world situations, with the mix of engine loads encountered in normal driving. Phase II efforts will be conducted in association with a commercial partner that builds remote sensing instruments to detect motor vehicle pollution.",

This system is based on ultra-wideband RF communications; its signals are inherently difficult to jam, it allows for penetration in urban structures, and it is cost effective forlarge-scale military usage.  During Phase I, we have confirmed the advantages of UWB for this application, demonstrated the current version of our Localizer system, Generation 5, and addressed key future design specifications (e.g. signal attenuation,multipath removal, range limitations, power consumption, size, weight, etc.).  We have also shown the current Generation 5 Localizer prototype, beyond the \"brass-board\" specification requested in the Phase I, to the entire Phase I review staff in Quantico.During Phase II, we propose to make a demonstration of the Localizer for the USMC.  We will make revisions to the Generation 5 Localizer, as required for the demonstration.

The system would use an array of bacteriophage engineered to express fluorescent protein in infected BW agents.   The specificity of the phage provides capture of only targets of interest, while the infection of the bacteria and naturalreplication of the expressed protein will provide the detection signal.   Using novel OLED arrays, a phage array chip can be constructed similar to DNA chips for multianalyte detection.   The combination of the phage array approach with OLED detectionallows development of a powerful biosensing system that does not require additional labeling, sample manipulation, or complex instrumentation.Agave BioSystems was completely successful in completing the Phase I program and demonstrating proof-of-concept for this innovative technology.  In the Phase II program, we will complete the development of a prototype analyser and micro-assay chipssuitable for detection of biowarfare or bioterroists bacterial agents of interest. Potential markets include the food processing, environmental, medical and agricultural sectors. Relevant examples include the detection of Listeria monocytogenes in dairyfoods and detection of multi-drug resistant bacteria in hospitals and clinics. All bacteria responsible for these outbreaks are susceptible to phage infection, and thus are likely candidates for detection by the phage array biosensor.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Conventional fluorescence-activated cell sorters (FACSs) are widely used to study eukaryotic cell populations. Although they provide impressively efficient sorting, they are costly, mechanically complex, and require large sample volumes and trained personnel for operation and maintenance. In addition, the footprint per unit separation is considerable and they typically require large input populations. Inexpensive devices that rapidly sort live cell, particles and even single molecules would greatly facilitate screening of combinatorial chemical, biochemical or biological libraries taking advantage of the enormous power of in vitro evolution. Moreover, such devices would have wide applications in clinical medicine and basic research. Current systems are also not well suited for use in low gravity environments or impose a significant cost in payload size and weight. Agave BioSystems proposes to develop a miniature flow cytometer/ fluorescent cell sorter (nanoSort) based on a novel micropumping system with an integrated optical waveguide that will eliminate these shortcomings. The microfabricated system will be ideal for use in low gravity environments as well as typical laboratory settings and will be both compact and lightweight.",

In this Phase I effort, we propose to engineer chimeric proteins that fuse CD14 bacterial binding protein and the Fc portion of IgE antibodies. These novel bacterial receptors will bind to both mast cells and a large variety of pathogenic bacteria, enabling the mast cells to sense very low levels of contaminating bacteria from a diverse population. Using a compact yet highly sensitive fluorometer, this innovative biological receptor and signal transduction system will provide detection capability for a wide variety of pathogens in a single small and lightweight biosensor.

Several known enzymes exhibit hydrolytic activity on target organophosphorus compounds including nerve agent chemical weapons such as sarin and soman as well as many commercially available pesticides, including parathion, methyl parathion and chlorpyrifos. Many of these enzymes have been derived from bacterial sources and are unfortunately not conducive to use as an in-vivo medical treatment for a variety of reasons including acute antigenicity, poor enzyme stability, and brief in-vivo residence times. When one considers that annually 3 million cases of severe poisoning and 220,000 deaths worldwide are associated with OP pesticides, there are obviously unmet needs associated with their use. There is a clear need for technology capable of protecting individuals from overexposure to OP compounds. Successful Phase I research has demonstrated that the concept of protecting a person from an otherwise debilitating dose of OP toxins with chemically modified enzyme is viable. Modified OP hydrolyzing enzymes have potential utility as medical treatments for exposed individuals as well as preventative security for individuals at high risk of OP exposure. Such treatments have potential utility at hospitals, agricultural sites employing OP pesticides, civil defense treatment centers for chemical terrorism, and with the armed forces. Research will also be extended to other model systems of clinical relevance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Agriculture needs new bio-rational pest control agents to replace outdated synthetic chemicals. Safer, smarter, target-specific control measures are required for use in sustainable integrated pest management (IPM) systems. New technologies are essential to IPM in high value fruit, nut, and vegetable crops where the most widely used insecticides are organophosphates (OPs) and carbamates. In 1998, 37 registered insecticidal OPs accounted for approximately 50% of the agricultural area treated by insecticides. Maize, cotton, and other row crops received 74% of the OPs, where as 26% went on fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Apples and potatoes represented 43% and 53%, respectively, of the total OP-treated acreage. Many of these pesticides face tolerance reassessment under EPA's Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA). In many cases, regulatory authorities have restricted or eliminated OPs due to their high toxicity. In other cases, the registrants may have no option but to cancel certain uses, because the cost of complying with new registration requirements may not be justified by the size of the market. Loss of registered products will severely weaken or eliminate IPM programs that are built around a rotational use of different classes of chemicals with different modes of action. With fewer options available for pest control resistance to overused alternatives will build. Large acreage row crops are developing a reliance on a limited collection of Bacillus thuringiensis toxins and other transgenic protein-based events. In vegetable and tree crops, controversy and industrial consolidation have extended the event horizon and limited the deployment of transgenic opportunities. Microbial natural products offer an untapped source of agrochemical diversity. Successful products in this category, including the avermectins and spinosyns, achieved acceptance and rapidly captured market share because of their efficacy and highly specific pesticidal activities. Recent advances in industrial fermentation coupled with a rapidly expanding understanding of the genetics of secondary metabolite production are enabling a revolution in the industrial production methods for large complex bioactive molecules. Completion of Phase II SBIR research will demonstrate the commercial efficacy of a novel microbial bioinsecticide in agricultural applications. Completion of the following technical objectives are anticipated: 1) Complete isolation and characterization of the biologically active components from a Streptomycetes-based bioinsecticide, 2) Development of analytical detection methods and mode of action studies, 3) Strain improvement, 4) Fermentation process optimization at industrial scale, 5) Formulation studies, 6) Expanded laboratory and field scale evaluation of pesticidal efficacy, 7) Toxicology and EPA regulatory submission. Completion of these goals will demonstrate the commercial potential of this bioinsecticide, and provide important regulatory data necessary for EPA registration.",

When available, this tool provides an acoustic engineer access to both the experimental data being measured and analytical predictions that are derived from empirical models and a database. Thus, the proposed tool takes advantage of an existing database that includes pertinent extensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data. As data are being recorded, the tool generates acoustic spectra at locations that are not part of the experimental setup to provide in-situ prediction. Furthermore, this high-level analysis tool improves the quality of the experimental data by detecting potential problems as the data is being taken; hence, the engineer can intervene in the process to eliminate anomalies or improve results. The analytical prediction tool, once calibrated, can be used to predict acoustic spectra during launch at various locations on and around the spacecraft. These acoustic load predictions can then be used for structural dynamic analysis. The proposed tool incorporates several input parameters that an analyst can change to simulate or eliminate perturbations in the experimental conditions. This flexibility helps determine the sensitivity of the measured experimental results to various parameters.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ASRI proposes to develop a low-cost PC-based Dynamic Signal Analyzer (DSA) utilizing a novel spectral enhancement method to provide incipient fault-detection capabilities for rotating machinery. Based on a new spectral analysis technique called Coherent Phase Line Enhancer (CPLE), the DSA will significantly enhance critical speed-related signatures in vibration measurements thus providing early detection for machinery health monitoring and diagnosis. Unlike the conventional method for Power Spectral Density (PSD) function estimation, the CPLE technique incorporates phase information into the spectral estimation process. This is achieved through detection of a unique coherent phase relationship associated with all speed-related signal components in the wave-number domain. Accordingly, the CPLE spectrum detects well-hidden fault-mechanism signatures (bearing, gear, rotor instability, etc.) that are often unnoticed by a conventional PSD. The significance of the proposed innovation is attributed to its enhanced capability to cope with severe operational environments where health-monitoring measurements are heavily corrupted by background noise. Successful development of CPLE-DSA can enhance incipient fault detection capability, reducing catastrophic engine failure risks and will improve reliability of NASA's advanced propulsion systems. Phase I will demonstrate feasibility and relative benefits of CPEL-DSA. In Phase II a PC-based CPLE-DSA hardware/software prototype will be built and tested for demonstration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65892      High power applications typically use power converters that are large, expensive, difficult to control, and present significant engineering challenges as power density and power capacity increase.  Gate Turn Off thyristor systems, including variants that utilize Emitter Turn Off thyristors and Integrated Gate Commutated thyristors, exhibit slow switching speeds, have poor reverse bias safe operating area, and require high gate currents to turn the devices off.  These traits limit their usefulness in high power applications, especially where higher switching frequencies are desired.  This project will develop an optically isolated, mega-watt level, cascaded inverter based upon recent advances in optical sensors, optical interconnects, and High-Voltage Integrated Gate Bipolar Transistors (HV-IGBTs).  In Phase 1, a prototype full-bridge megawatt inverter was developed, based upon newly available HV-IGBTs, and combined with optical sensing, interfacing, and control.  Design parameters were established for maximum voltages, currents, harmonics, and switching frequencies.  Phase II will develop a prototype, full-bridge, megawatt inverter with greater than 98% efficiency, and with higher reliability and a smaller footprint compared to thyristor inverters.           Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The modularized HV-IBGT inverter should offer significant benefits over the conventional thyristor-based inverter,  reducing productivity losses due to voltage sags and momentary outages that affect most industrial and commercial customers such as semiconductor manufacturers, telecommunications, banks, restaurants, and hospitals.  These productivity losses exceed $10 billion/year in the U.S. alone.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         AJT proposes to develop a low-cost, engine test-stand system for small (500 pound) thrust engines using gaseous, liquid or cryogenic propellants. This test stand would incorporate automated propellant transfer and automated propellant line purge systems. The engines would be configured to a standard test-stand interface, greatly reducing the time required to install and remove various engines. This interface is a novel concept, which allows manufacturers of various engine types and configurations to use the same engine test-stand without making any modifications to the test-stand facility. This interface will incorporate quick connectors for propellant and instrumentation interfaces. The stand and interface would be instrumented with thrust monitoring sensors. This concept is scalable for other and much larger engine test facilities. Innovative methods of providing an interface mating plate greatly reduces the installation time and an automated verification system assures that the mating is properly completed. The latching mechanism would be manually actuated to reduce size and costs. The propellant line purging and pressurization would be automated, using remotely controlled valves, flow and pressure sensors. Because this system is for a relatively new class of small thrust engines, an entirely new approach is proposed, building on concepts and designs previously developed by AJT.",

The formation of laser-induced plasma, which produces a localized blackbody source for atomic emissions, enables this technology. Collection of the plasma's spectral signature by a lens or optical fiber allows examination for elemental components of numerous materials. Recently, it has been shown that the stand-off measurement capabilities and ablative nature of the LIBS instrument would provide an extremely useful tool for space and planetary exploration. Geological features can be examined from a distance, reducing the time required to position a rover and expanding the area investigated during each mission. To further the usefulness of the LIBS instrument for space flight conditions, compact, lightweight, low power and robust systems are required. To meet this end, Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (RMD) will develop a highly sensitive, echelle spectrometer and an array of Geiger photodiodes (GPD). Matching the GPD array format with the output from an echelle spectrometer will provide simultaneous monitoring of the major and minor elements of greatest interest, while eliminating the need for a scanning or multiple grating system.",

Thus, there is a need for a hand-held, direct-reading instrument.  So far, the methods proposed for this purpose have not had the sensitivity (or required long count times) to be of practical use.  This project will develop a practical, easy-to-use, multi-element, solid-state, Avalanche Photodiode (APD) array-based instrument for rapid detection and imaging of tritium contamination on surfaces and in air.  During Phase I, a multi-element APD unit was designed and constructed.  The evaluation of the Phase I unit demonstrated that the APD array-based instrument not only surpasses the performance of current commercial instruments, but also meets regulatory guidelines that no other compact, real-time surface imaging instrument has approached.  The low noise of the APD detector provided a way to rapidly detect levels of activity less than 1000 dpm/100 cm2.  Phase II will extend the Phase I research into the development of a multichannel field-usable prototype for dosimetry and imaging.  Improvements in the electronics and readout, along with a mechanical design that allows data collection in various environmental conditions, will lead to a sophisticated instrument for the rapid detection and imaging of tritium on various surfaces.             Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The proposed surface monitor should significantly enhance the ability to monitor the presence of tritium at controlled sites.  There is a critical need for such instruments at DOE facilities undergoing decommissioning and at facilities, which require screening before equipment can be released.

However, clinical PET scanners used for human imaging are bulky and expensive, and do not have adequate spatial resolution for small animal studies.  Dedicated, low cost instruments are required for these small animal studies, with higher spatial resolution than currently achieved with clinical PET scanners.  This project will utilize position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPDs) coupled to LSO arrays as PET sensors for small animal PET imaging.

Using a new approach for enhancing the near-infrared (IR) sensitivity of high gain avalanche photodiodes (APDs), Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc.

This work utilizes an innovative technique to microtexture the front surface of the APD using high power, ultra-short laser pulses (100 femto-seconds). The laser processed silicon surface exhibits remarkably high absorption characteristics over a large range of wavelengths (0.4 - 3 microns). Phase I work established that this processing technique provides an enhancement in the photo-induced charge collection at near-IR wavelengths. We have further demonstrated APD responsivity > 350 A/W at 1064 nm. Evidence of silicon bandgap transformations makes this remarkable innovation extremely promising for present detector technology needs.The ultimate goal of this project is to use laser microtexturing technology to develop a high speed, high gain, low noise APD array sensor module with significantly improved near-IR response. The APD array sensor will be an extremely valuable tool for long distance optical communication and for LIDAR/LADAR applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an in vivo analog of autoradiography, which makes it a potentially powerful new tool for imaging biological processes and molecular targets in small laboratory animals. Its fundamental advantage is that functional data can be obtained non-invasively, allowing each animal to be studied repeatedly. Thus, each animal can serve as its own control in studies with a longitudinal design. There is significant interest in small animal PET within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry because in vivo quantification of biological processes to measure an agent'smechanism of action and its concentration at the site of action are of great importance in drug development.   While the advantages of small animal imaging with PET are obvious, the challenges are also very significant. The main barriers to using PET in studies of laboratory animals have traditionally been poor spatial resolution, low sensitivity, and high cost. To address these deficiencies, we propose to develop a detector that can achieve extremely fine spatial resolution and high sensitivity in a cost-effective manner. The detector will be based on finely pixelated monolithic block of scintillator coupled to a position sensitive detector. Phase II efforts will focus on the development of a proof-of-concept benchtop small-animal PET system, consisting of a small number of complete detector modules.",

Based on our Phase I experience, advanced research and development will be carried out to design and fabricate a sophisticated 64-channel ASIC readout for RMD APD arrays. The new design will encompass all of the Phase I prototype's desirable properties while correcting its defects. Subsequent research will be carried out to enable the coupling of the ASIC directly to the APD array. The resulting module will be thoroughly tested and evaluated. This work will directly enable and facilitate the use of compact APD arrays in small animal PET (and imaging systems in general) by providing a high-density readout scheme capable of processing the large number of signals produced by the array. The high-performance readout ASIC will replace old, bulky, modularized equipment, increase the performance of entire PET systems, and decrease the cost to implement these systems. We envision an LSO/APD/ASIC module that will form the basis of a commercial product to be primarily produced and assembled by RMD that will principally be used in high-resolution, small-animal PET. The adaptation of the module to clinical and human PET will comprise future Phase Ill commercialization work.",

We are developing knowledge-based STAP (KBSTAP) approaches that include three techniques for predicting regions in the CPI data cube that are likely tocontain targets: (1) use ALPHATECH's MHT Tracker to project target locations from previous CPIs, (2) transform information about roads and traffic speed distribution into the CPI coordinate frame, and (3) use the output of STAP itself in an iterative loopto estimate and then remove targets responses.  We are also developing two techniques for removing target responses from the training data: (1) apply a re-weighted covariance estimator after excision; (2) coherently suppress the target response using avariant of the CLEAN algorithm and estimate the clutter covariance after omitting the contaminated cells. In Phase II will refine the algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness using high quality simulation as well as actual data.\"",

These techniques are designed for a battlefieldscenario in which the ground vehicle under attack is illuminated by a stand-off airborne SAR sensor before, during and after the weapon strike, all in a continuous-dwell collection mode.  The technology we propose complements baseline algorithms thatALPHATECH is already developing under DARPA's Real-Time Battle Damage Assessment program.  To detect weapon impact, we will use an advanced autoregressive approach to estimate and remove the stationary target skin-line response and then enhance residualsarising from transient oscillations.  To help predict overall system performance and identify key design trades, we will also conduct studies to assess the fundamental detectability of the transient signature as a function of sensor parameters (frequencybandwidth, SINR, etc.) and target response (frequency, duration, amplitude, etc.) The goal of this study will be to formulate a radar equation for through-strike BDA.  Finally, we will use a new signal processing technique, termed Adaptive BackgroundCancellation (ABC) to localize the target signature changes.

The MSTAR program has successfully demonstrated the applicability ofmodel-based recognition to 2D SAR processing of targets in a range of operating conditions (OCs).  We will extend that approach to 3D LADAR exploitation.  3D LADAR, by virtue of generating high resolution 3D geometric reconstructions of a scene, is anatural application for shape-oriented model-based reasoning.  Our technical approach to 3D LADAR ATR consists of supporting single to multiple LADAR looks and is based on uncertainty modeling and hierarchical part-based surface alignment methods.  The 3Drecognition approach is well-suited for recognizing partially-occluded variably-configured targets in cluttered environments and is therefore an excellent candidate for ATR evaluation under OCs.  Our ATR evaluation methodology will also leverage theexperience and tools developed under the MSTAR program, decomposing performance measures along the sensor, target, and environment operating dimensions.  Our team is composed of the developers of MSTAR's model-based reasoning modules and the evaluators ofthe MSTAR system and is well-positioned to extend our SAR experience to LADAR performance characterization.\"",

The main detection principle is based on dual measurement of both absorption and fluorescence employing thin films ofporphyrin/polymer membrane. In Phase I of the project we studied the luminescence compounds and demonstrated that thin films of porphyrin-based membranes exhibit quite specific signal response to different kinds of target metals. It has been found thatcoordination of the heavy metals into the porphyrin/polymer films provides spectral shifts in absorption of the porphyrin/polymer membrane. The fabricated sensor material exhibited both high selectivity and sensitivity to the specific heavy metals. Thedemonstrated detection limits using absorption measurement were at ppb level. We expect increasing of the sensitivity up to ppt level and further improving the sensor selectivity employing fluorescence measurement scheme with optimized sensory film. InPhase II of this project we will complete development and optimization of the sensitive material for sensors of heavy metal ions. The Prototype fiber-optic sensor system based on this material will be developed and delivered to DoD by the end of theproject.\"",

Such a system will bridge the gap between the tight glucose control currently recommended by the American Diabetes Association and the convenience and quality of life desired by persons with diabetes. This system will be based on a proprietary thermal microporation technology which eliminates the barrier function of the stratum corneum to percutaneous infusion. We hypothesize that a thermal microporation based infusion system can controllably deliver insulin over an extended period of time in a manner similar to insulin pumps available on the market today. Phase I efforts demonstrated the feasibility of an insulin infusion system which combines the thermal microporation method with iontophoresis. Phase II efforts will focus on patch design and insulin formulation to optimize the product as well as evaluating the capabilities, repeatability and controllability of a MicroPor(TM)-based insulin infusion system.",

In Phase I, various magnetic suspensions, magnetic materials, insulations and mechanical stops for the cryo-maglev transfer line has been comprehensively investigated. Two demo modules of the cryo-transfer line has been designed and constructed. The cryogenic tests of the modules successfully demonstrate the vertical magnetic suspension, horizontal stability, and other important performances that have paved the solid ground for a Phase II project. In phase II, further optimizations of the designs and performances of cryo-maglev transfer lines will be conducted analytically and experimentally to meet the KSC technical requirements.

Two full sized prototype transfer lines will be designed, constructed and cryogenic tested at KSC.

Microarray analysis has the potential for uncovering the complex behavior of gene expression. Microarray trends are becoming established which includes higher throughput and a need to analyze pg quantities of mRNA. This proposal is focused on one aspect of microarray technology (aRNA amplification) which plans to meet the observed trends of the industry. The current multi-step amplification process introduces a source of variability, time and expense. As the amount of input mRNA is lowered, likewise, confidence is reduced and the array experiments themselves have questionable validity. We recognized this limitation as an opportunity that our research group should study, specifically, how can we use our expertise and our supply of high quality transcription reagents to establish a R&D; program to enhance the performance of RNA amplification methods? We will design an exhaustive optimization plan to explore a large matrix of conditions, work that is most suitable for a robotic platform. Careful microarray analysis with numerous internal controls will be used to monitor the progress of the optimization program to insure that the representation is accompanied enhanced yields. The optimized enzymatic steps will be integrated on to automated platforms, which will increase the throughput and consistency of the method for research demanding a large number of samples. The effort spent creating the robotic program will serve two purposes. First, it will allow us to screen a large space of reaction conditions (finding optimal reactants) it also be instrumental for creating the next versions of RNA amplification kits, specifically for common robots. The goal of the larger study is to further optimize each step of the method for the commercialization of kits, robotic reagent packages and finally a microfluidic device and accompanying reagents.",

The Cells-to-Signal assay will be especially useful by pharmaceutical companies in drug discovery for the high throughput screening of multiple compounds for their effects on the transcription of specific genes. The major challenge will be developing this technology to be compatible with whole blood. Additionally, when paired with a portable device, this technology will have strong potential as a point-of-care diagnostic.

In phase II, we will develop complete systems to support the rapid screening of cultured cells in 96- and 384-well formats and to develop assays that are compatible with whole blood. A large component of this research will be to implement methods that prevent genomic DNA detection.

Technological enhancements\r to the Phase I Feedback Actigraph, now referred to as BuzzBee, will allow multiple activity recorders (belt-worn by ADHD diagnosed children) equipped with vibrotactile, auditory, and visual feedback to be controlled via telemetry by a teacher and/or school psychologist. Phase I results pointed out the need for remote handling of the device in order to minimize  child embarrassment and teacher workload in a mainstream classroom. This project seeks to provide definitive proof as to the efficacy of this behavioral management technique by employing measures that have been successfully employed in the validation of\r pharmacological therapies for the same population. A single blind crossover\r design varying activity contingent, and sham feedback will utilize a\r combination of teacher rating scales and time-on-task measurements. In\r addition, we are including two state-of-the-art measures for demonstrating\r efficacy on a subset of subjects, the OPTAx and fMRI. OPTAx involves a high\r precision optical measurement of head movement in three dimensions during the\r performance of cognitive tests, while fMRI measures blood flow in an area of\r the brain linked to ADHD.",

Building upon existing inverse kinematics, rule-based control, and neural network learning technology, the training method enhances robot capabilities through operator supervision. The current innovation enables the online construction of rule-based plans of action through verbal dialogue between operator and robot, and uses verbal, visual, and manual cues such as spoken words, hand gestures, and the pushing of buttons and joysticks to teach neural networks how to improve nominal rule-based performance. Phase I results indicate that given an underlying library of intelligent behaviors, non-trivial robot task plans can be created and modified verbally by an operator in a straightforward manner. Phase II will optimize the behavior control system, training process, and operator interface. Validation will focus on two scenarios: assisting EVA astronauts with tool preparation and handling using the Johnson Space Center?s Robonaut system, and assisting a physiologically degraded astronaut in partial gravity environments. The show-and-tell approach to adaptive control is expected to give future NASA robots an unending ability to learn, and NASA astronauts the ability to customize robot behavior for both routine tasks and unexpected situations.",

Airborne or satellite borne radar measurement systems would be preferred due to their ability to cover large areas rapidly and be used in all weather conditions, both day and night.  However, existing airborne and satellite radar sensor systems have frequencies above 400 MHz, which cannot penetrate the thick canopies of heavily wooded areas.  A lower frequency (<400 MHz) radar system is needed, but at these frequencies large antennas are requirements for imaging. This project will modify a low frequency (100 MHz) non-imaging airborne radar system, BioSAR, for the measurement of terrestrial biomass in heavily wooded areas.  In Phase I, the additions and modifications required to adapt the BioSAR hardware and software systems for the measurement of carbon were defined, a prototype was designed, and the end-user requirements were identified.  Phase II will fabricate, install, integrate, and demonstrate the airborne performance of the prototype designed in Phase I.  Two missions will be conducted to refine the coefficients of the new carbon sensing algorithms and to demonstrate the capability of the system to provide for the rapid and accurate remote measurement of biomass, carbon, and board feet per acre.

For example, compact power transmission cables, motors, and generators could be attained by using high temperature superconductors (HTS) with a high critical current density Jc at 77K and magnetic fields of up to 1.5 Tesla.  The superconductor YBa2Cu3Ox (YBCO) could be employed as the enabling material.  However, for this to occur, the superconductor must have a high degree of bi-axial texture along long lengths.  This project will produce YBCO coated conductors by combining buffered, high quality deformation-textured alloy substrates with a low cost solution-based YBCO deposition process.  In Phase I, various experimental alloys were made in long lengths and evaluated for suitability for the YBCO coated conductor process.  The most suitable candidate was identified for further development.  In Phase II, long lengths of coated conductors will be made with further performance enhancements.  The conductors will be tested in an environment that closely simulates a commercial application.            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  High performance, low cost, superconducting YBCO coated conductors should have application to the electric power industry.

Advances in understanding the causes and prevention of these and other problems require studies that include more than one pregnancy/birth for a given woman.  The only viable source of data for such studies of reproductive history is birth records. However, birth records will not currently support such research because they do not contain unique maternal IDs and cannot be grouped by the mother. \r \r We will create a maternally linked data set for thirteen years of birth records for the eight southeastern states in Federal Region IV (9 million records), which has the worst perinatal outcomes in the country. The demographic and geographic diversity of this population and the large sample size will allow investigation of a broad range of pressing maternal and infant health issues. \r \r A public-use file of the linked records will be marketed to investigators at universities and similar institutions. We will develop advanced quantitative methods for maternally linked data, which will be included as analytic aids in the documentation for the file.",

The coating is appliedby using a Cathodic Arc Physical Vapor Deposition coatingmachine.  The coating application may be modified to optimize thecoating for various applications.  For example, a more corrosionresistant and less erosion resistant coating can be applied usingthe same CATARC PVD process to address the operationalrequirements of the user.  The coating can be applied on variousmaterial types such as titanium, nickel and steel alloys andvarious engine types from small helicopter engines to largerturbofan engines.  The coating can be used for aircraft, ship andindustrial applications.BENEFITS: The U.S. Military Services experience significant rates of erosion and corrosion on gas turbine engine compressor systems that effects engine performance, aircraft readiness and total cost of ownership.  The erosion / corrosion resistant coatingcan be optimized and applied on most gas turbine engines powering air vehicles, tanks and ships.  The potential market extends beyond military applications to commercial uses such as helicopters, commercial airlines and industrial power plants.Significant cost savings can be realized annually by not scrapping compressor airfoils due to erosion and corrosion.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anamed has developed PermaVisionr intracorneal implants for the correction of refractive errors, specifically, hyperopia from +1D to +6D. These implants are made from a selected proprietary Nutraporer micro-porous hydrogel that allows transport of fluid and nutrients satisfying the needs of the human cornea. There is no permanent solution for hyperopia today. Implantation is done using a procedure to be called Sutureless Synthetic Keratophakia (SSKTM). This involves lamellar dissection to generate a flap (like in LASIK surgery), placing the lens on the stromal bed and closing the flap without sutures. Rehabilitation is quick. The power of the lens is predefined and pre-tested during manufacturing so the surgeon can accurately correct the power in one sitting. The procedure is reversible and adjustable. Improper power correction/lens placement can easily be corrected by re-lifting the flap and replacing/repositioning the lens. During Phase II we propose to develop final lens design(s), manufacture clinical supplies, conduct a Phase I clinical trial under an approved USFDA-IDE, develop commercial packaging and sterilization process, determine shelf life and photo-stability, select a marking material/method to confirm proper lens placement/orientation which was found difficult during the one year GLP swine study (completed), develop commercial manufacturing process(es), and perform validations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A new generation of Ka-band helical traveling wave tube (TWT) power amplifiers with efficiencies of over 60% will be developed. The dramatic increase in efficiency over current state-of-the-art amplifiers with about 45% efficiency will be achieved by the introduction of a novel taper to suppress all parasitic power flow, the elimination of severs, and new approaches for the minimization of circuit losses. These innovations will lead to large reductions in power requirements, circuit size, and system weight, and will result in enormous cost savings for launch and operation of communication satellites. The proposed technology development promises to provide the biggest contribution to efficiency enhancement in helical TWTs since the introduction of velocity tapers some 35 years ago and will enable high frequency digital broadband communications for near-Earth and deep-space missions with multi-gigabit-per-second data rates.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Alchemist system we are proposing is a combined-cycle system which reduces Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) liftoff weights by a factor of four relative to all-rocket systems. This reduces the weight of major elements (e.g. Jet engines, wing, and landing gear)by 60%, and allows us the margin to use the same principles and advantages commercial airplanes use to achieve very safe operations and low operating costs. Using Alchemist, a completely reusable RLV, weighing less than a 777 at takeoff, can operate out of existing commercial airport facilities and deliver the same usable payload to the International Space Station as the Space Shuttle . Turbofan engines are an integral partof the Alchemist system, providing not only takeoff, climb, and cruise propulsion, but all-envelope intact-abort capability, plus ferry capability. With the turbofans on board we have single-fault tolerance against catastrophic failure on all flight critical systems including main propulsion. Single-fault tolerance on all systems provides the operational breakthrough necessary to transition from artillery-like to airplane-like launch systems. Our calculations show that an RLV designed to take full advantage of Alchemist has less than a 1/10,000 chance of loss-of-vehicle and operating costs of $500/kilogram to LEO.",

Angiogenic factors can increase vascularization and improve perfusion in ischemia. Scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF) may be superior to other angiogenic factors because of multiple actions on components of the angiogenic cascade and anti-apoptotic properties. Our Phase I studies demonstrated therapeutic angiogenesis by SF/HGF gene therapy in rat and mouse models of peripheral ischemia. We will confirm and extend this work by obtaining detailed dose and time course information with long-term follow-up for therapeutic benefit as well as adverse effects in the mouse hindlimb ischemia model. We will also examine the benefits of SF/HGF gene therapy in treating peripheral ischemia in aging mice and in mice with diabetes. The rabbit model of peripheral ischemia will be used to assess the effectiveness of SF/HGF gene therapy by physiological assessment of blood flow and hindlimb perfusion pressure and anatomical assessment of collateral vessel development, capillary density and muscle atrophy. In additional studies we will compare the effectiveness of SF/HGF gene therapy with VEGF therapy. The goal of these studies is to bring SF/HGF gene therapy to clinical practice.",

Its conceptual foundation stems from mission planning content and processesrepresented using Unified Modeling Language (UML) that capture the information, behavioral activities, contexts, events, and products comprising the planning process.  This model will be extended to derive deep-level, skill-based indices of effectiveplanning and briefing.  The UML model will then feed the specification of WARMUP software components that collect, analyze, and generate products from these indices.  Components include a data collection device used by subject matter experts; a softwareagent to extract and analyze quality indices from a DMT simulation or flight line debriefing system; and an updateable, scaleable relational database to organize the data and indices.  By exercising this database through structured queries, the WARMUPapplication will generate such products as a scenario-specific scorecard of planning/briefing quality, web-enabled best-practices material, and empirical data to support future R&D;, among others.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"Recent developments in DNA microarray generation technology have made entirely new methods of gene analysis feasible.  The DNA microarray can greatly facilitate research in the areas of drug and vaccine discovery, disease screening, and toxicology, amongothers.  Therefore, the importance of a low-cost, high-resolution, high-throughput DNA microarray generation system cannot be understated.  Current DNA microarray generation techniques suffer from severe limitations.  The development of a new DNAmircoarray generation technique that has the high resolution of photolithography with the low cost of operation of mechanical deposition would significantly accelerate the pace of gene research.  In this proposal, we present a method to generate DNAmicroarrays using a maskless lithography system.  The maskless lithography system incorporates a large-array spatial light modulator to serve as a programmable mask.  The spatial light modulator technology is integrated with Anvik's patented large arealithography technology to produce a breakthrough in lithography system development that allows rapid, high-density DNA microarray generation at low cost.  In the Phase I program, we have developed the maskless lithography process specifically for DNAmicroarray generation.  In the proposed Phase II program, we will construct a fully functional maskless lithography system and demonstrate the generation of DNA microarrays with an optimized process.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most prevalent chronic blood-borne infection in the U.S and a global health problem. Approximately 4 million individuals in the U.S. and 170 million individuals worldwide are chronically infected. As much as 40 percent of chronic liver disease is HCV related and this results in up to 10,000 deaths each year. Despite improvements, treatment of remains suboptimal, and new therapeutic options are critically needed. Apath, LLC has developed cell-based assays for testing and screening of compounds with antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV). These assays are based on Huh7 cell lines that contain a constructively replicating subgenomic HCV replicon. The cells have been analyzed extensively and have been demonstrated to contain an HCV replicon that exhibits autonomous HCV RNA replication. We have promoted these cell lines as drug-discovery tools by formatting assays for compound screening that are amenable to high throughput screening. In this Phase II proposal we describe our plans to use these cell-based assays to identify compounds with anti-HCV activity. Toward this goal we will plan to utilize a unique source of natural compounds and to screen over 40,000 wells containing up to 200,000 discrete compounds to identify \"hits\" that inhibit replication of the HCV replicon. We will confirm antiviral activity of all \"hits\" in secondary HCV replicon quantitation and cytotoxicity assays. We will identify compounds with the most promising chemical and biological profiles to pursue as potential anti-HCV drugs. We also plan to identify targets of leads through biochemical and genetic approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"Fretting is a wear phenomenon that occurs between two mating surfaces: it is adhesive in nature, and vibration is its essential causative factor. Usually fretting is accompanied by corrosion. In general, fretting occurs between two tight fitting surfacesthat are subjected to a cyclic, relative motion of extremely small amplitude. Fretted regions are highly sensitive to fatigue cracking. Under fretting conditions fatigue cracks are nucleated at very low stresses. Nucleation of fatigue cracks in frettedregions depends mainly on the state of stress on the surface and particularly on the stresses superimposed on the cyclic stress. The time to nucleation of cracks can be significantly reduced as a result of fretting. Common sites for fretting are in jointsthat are bolted, keyed, pinned, press fitted, and riveted. These sites are common in the assembly of most air vehicles, ground vehicles, power plants, equipment, and machinery. All applications that have safety issues, maintenance issues, and service liferequirements will benefit from quantitative methods that provide the impact of fretting on the component's service.The multi-task objectives of the plan discussed in this proposal are:1) Integrate and implement the techniques of modified fretting fatigue predictive analytic models into structural integrity framework,2) Demonstrate integration for applications to present and future U.S. military weapons programs, commercial aviation, auto",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65519     The corrosion of metal alloys used in energy production and conservation limits the lifetime of components made from these materials.  The metal surfaces are protected by passive oxide layers, yet basic questions about how these layers break down and initiate corrosion are not answered.  This project will develop a non-invasive, video microscopy technique to assay the initiation and subsequent dynamics of localized corrosion on metal surfaces.  Phase I developed a system to control a video microscope, image capture board, and a proprietary in-house video analysis software program to create a visual assay of a corroding metal surface in an aqueous solution.  Areas of change less than 8 microns in diameter were clearly seen on an aluminum sample surface within 6 seconds of immersion in a corrosive solution (with 10x magnification).  Phase II will improve the video assay and merge it with scanning probe techniques and standard electrochemical techniques within a single platform.  This system will provide four simultaneous non-invasive methods to monitor localized corrosion on metal surfaces in corrosive solutions.  All techniques will have three-dimensional capability.              Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This non-invasive assay combining different techniques should be used in corrosion laboratories to study basic mechanisms of passivity breakdown and thereby improve metal alloys and corrosion protection.  The video assay also should have application to the analysis of other phenomena for studying the kinetics of localized changes (e.g. growth of bio-films).",

In Phase I we took the general approach of developing a capacitor that was not specific to the application.In this proposal the application has been narrowed to the development of an integrated decoupling capacitor.  In order to accomplish this we have received support from three semiconductor companies : Atmel, EM Microelectronics and Vitesse.

In the case of the first two companies these will be silicon wafers, while the third application will be on GaAs.

MEMS technology enables development of spacecraft devices and subsystems that are small, low-cost, low mass, low volume, and low power consumption. A Stirling powered microcooler device was studied and investigated in Phase II. MEMS devices offer improvements in spacecraft efficiencies and new mission functionalities, MEMS introduces new challenges directly related to their micro-size and solid-state structure. Space missions require devices to operate in harsh environments with extreme temperatures, debris, planetary atmospheres and electromagnetic radiation. A pervasive issue facing users of MEMS devices in all environments is the availability and design of packaging technologies for ensuring long-term reliability and performance of the devices. This project will develop packaging technologies for MEMS based on innovative polymeric materials that are processable into diamond like carbon and silicon carbide materials. Packaging benefits include:? High wear surfaces? Thermally conductive? Electrically insulating? Anti-stiction? Hard surface? Low porosity? Low coefficient of friction? CTE matched to siliconThese materials are also expected to be low in cost compared to chemical vapor deposition materials and they achieve higher purity and quality.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65456     This project will develop the information required to promote tree planting systems that encourage deep rooting, thus enhancing carbon sequestration and providing other benefits to the environment.  Phase I collected root mass data (and thus carbon) in the subsoil of 3 to 10 year old trees to determine both the validity of the approach of deep rooting technology and potential carbon gains from that technology.   Studies were conducted on how to adapt existing deep rooting technology to minimize installation costs and improve deep rooting efficacy to enhance carbon sequestration.  In Phase II, a field study will be conducted to evaluate the application of the deep rooting technology to the establishment of non-irrigated trees in semi-arid conditions with ground water 50 or more feet below ground surface.  Also, to provide additional incentive to utilize the carbon sequestration benefits of deep rooting technology, greenhouse and small-plot research will be conducted to evaluate the potential for expanding deep rooting technology to trees that have greater commercial value, such as fruit, nut, and valuable hardwood species.               Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The establishment of self-irrigated low-maintenance windbreaks or shelterbelts in semi-arid climates, where carbon is not readily recycled, should create an enhanced net positive carbon sequestration regime and be potentially useful in blocking desertification in some areas.  In addition, application of deep root technology to tree crop management (in citrus groves, for example) should not only offer enhanced carbon sequestration, but also allow  for the control and/or reduction of production resources such as energy, water, fertilizer, and pesticides.",

The Phase I calculations havedemonstrated that the radiometric signature for older GPS satellites is stronger than their newer counterparts. This is consistent with the fact that the absorptance of satellite solar panels increases with age and thereby increases its temperature; whichin turn creates a stronger radiometric signature. In order to ascertain the current thermal health, the first step is to build detailed mathematical models of the GPS satellites for radiometric evaluation. The second step is to implement a library ofalgorithms for determination of material degradation. The third step is to perform data fusion of the LWIR and Visual Spectrum intensity values for purposes of robust estimation of material degradation and also for use in multi-view tracking. The fourthstep is to determine a SBIRS-Low sensor management scheme so that the schedule for tracking of the GPS satellite is optimized. The developed technique will be tested using the AFSMC provided tracking data and by means of an independent third-party trial.\"",

This project will use a high purity, pulsed inductive, gas-breakdown plasma source to generate a plasma with a high directed velocity.  The source is positioned a large distance from the accelerator, resulting in separation of neutral gas from the accelerator and collimation of the ions entering the accelerator.   The goal of Phase I and II is to develop and field an ion source on the first stage of an accelerator.  Phase I developed a configuration for an inductively driven gas-breakdown plasma source that produced a >10 ms pulse of Argon plasma of >100mA/cm2 ion current density, with strongly axially directed ion energy of about 80 eV, and sub-eV transverse temperature.  The plasma was highly reproducible in spatial, temporal, and energy distributions.  Phase II will explore techniques to control the temporal shape of the ion pulse and improve the spatial uniformity.  More detailed measurements of the source, both at the gas breakdown region and downstream, will be performed to enhance the understanding of source behavior.  A 100 keV acceleration stage will be developed and used with the ion source to precisely quantify source performance, especially the transverse and longitudinal ion temperatures, and to explore effects of changes in source characteristics on beam quality.                Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Commercial applications of pulsed inductive plasma sources include plasma and ion beam processing and plasma propulsion schemes.  Ion sources should also have applications to other fusion power approaches, including high flux neutral beams and plasmoids for injection into magnetically confined plasmas and field reversed ion rings.",

(ASI), and its strategic allies, seek to exploit the unique combination of electrical and dimensional properties found in carbon nanofibers to minimize both differential and absolute charging of satellites, andthe dangers presented by such charging.  Methods to be developed include: 1) incorporation of nanofibers into the dielectric materials commonly used in satellite (e.g., KaptonO, TeflonO, and FR4 circuit board material) to allow these materials to bleedcharge directly, 2) intercalation of nanofibers with compounds that enhance secondary electron emission, and 3) exploitation of nanofiber field emission properties to eject electrons when certain voltage thresholds are exceeded.   Current forms ofconductive KaptonO have problems with reduced mechanical properties and electrical failure due to matrix expansion during extremes of thermal cycling.  The high aspect ratio of the nanofibers will overcome these difficulties, providing reliableconductivity over a wide temperature range without degradation of mechanical properties.  The final product will be a class of materials that simultaneously exploit all three channels of charge mitigation cited above.\"",

The Phase II project proposes to develop and commercialize a state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package utilizing the algorithms developed. The computational engine is based upon an advanced parallel, adaptive fast multipole (FMM) implementation of a 3-D Lagrangian vortex-boundary element method. Turbulence is accounted for via Large Eddy Simulation (LES) using a dynamic Smagorinsky sub-grid scale model. The method is (1) grid-free in the fluid domain, (2) virtually free of numerical diffusion, (3) inherently solution-adaptive, and (4) capable of modeling inhomogeneous unsteady wall-bounded turbulent flow. During Phase II additional innovative algorithms will be developed for FMM to substantially increase it computational speed as well as accuracy. Additionally, an LES model for unsteady inhomogeneous flows will be implemented and tested rigorously using problems of potential interest to industry. The software is ideal for simulation and analysis of complex laminar-through-turbulent flow phenomena involving massive flow separation, unsteady vortex shedding, transient jets in cross-stream, and wake-body interaction. Examples of interest to industry are flow over bluff bodies such as ground vehicles or buildings, in data storage units with rotating and moving parts; in internal combustion engines; and in and around rotating machinery such as pumps and fans.",

No low-cost commercial system exists to provide this level of accuracy for guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) and precision instrument pointing. ATA proposes to introduce a small inexpensive inertial attitude reference system based upon magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) angular rate sensor technology and a 'virtual star' inertial reference concept. The proposed MHD Stable Reference (MSTAR) will integrate technologies of low-noise sensors, actuators, electronics, and software into a miniature system with capability to function as a sub-arcsecond-level reference in payload pointing and attitude control. Our innovation resides in two areas: (1) fusing GNC and optical instrument pointing functions in order to achieve unprecedented accuracy, and (2) applying novel high-bandwidth, low-cost, low-power, rugged MHD sensor technology to meet this goal and enable commercialization. Unlike current approaches, this system can measure and cancel coupled interactions between instrument and platform at high frequency. The melding of low-frequency and high-frequency data and the use of a novel sensor will enable low-cost, low-weight, low-power, precision pointing for NASA's terrestrial and extra-terrestrial balloons and aerobots.",

The Phase I project showed that the material is non-wetting and compatible with molten aluminum. CerablakTM coatings developed on full-size thermocouple protection tubes showed excellent durability and non-wetting behavior.

The Phase I effort also produced the requirements for a simulation environment and measures of performance to empiricallyevaluate the interface.

In Phase II we will refine the requirements used to build the initial interface, using input from the current operational community.  Theresults of these operational reviews will be fed into the iterative design of an advanced prototype interface.  This distributed command interface prototype will be evaluated using the performance measures developed in the Phase I effort.  The methodologyand approaches that are developed in Phase II can be adapted and applied in other domains in which distributed teams are involved in diagnosis and resolution of unanticipated disruptions that occur in compl",

This presents the challenging problem of enabling access to these data sources via a common data access model and services. In this approach, all data conforms to a single data access model and a single API is used to provide data accessservices.Architecture Technology Corporation has developed a design for a common data access model and services utilizing the datalets concept and its associated ontology. This project will develop and test a prototype implementation of the datalets architecture.The research will leverage state-of-the-art technologies such as various XML protocols and agent-based programming. The resulting universal data access framework will be tested in the context of Air Mobility Command applications. The effort will becompatible with the overall approach of the \"Joint Battlespace Infosphere (JBI)\" research program.\"",

This system is going to be unique compared with existing commercial systems in several aspects. Specifically, there is no commercially available PDIV system that: 1) delivers KHz time-resolution measurements 2) integrates a dynamically adaptive methodology with particle-tracking schemes, resolving the global three-dimensional velocities in a multi-phase flow with high accuracy (sub-pixel) and enhanced spatial resolution 3) resolves the size and shape of a dispersed phase simultaneously with the velocity measurements. The proposed system will deliver all of the above becoming an equivalent of a combined DPIV, LDA and PDA in one competitively priced package with the flexibility to address different fluid mechanics problems.The success of Phase-I, the unique features of the proposed system, the innovative task identified for Phase-II, the assembly of an experience team to carry out the effort, combined with the fact that the most prominent fluid diagnostics company worldwide will be marketing the system almost guarantees the success of the proposed project.",

Thesystem will be designed for low-cost production, through the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, and low-cost operation, through the use of commercial aerial photography airplanes.  Cost will be further reduced through the successfultransfer of previously developed technology from the Airborne Remote Optical Spotlight System (AROSS) to the new system.  AROSS is a field-tested and robust electro-optical system producing time-series imagery with sufficient resolution and spatialcoverage for Navy METOC requirements.  The approximate cost of $2000 per hour to fly AROSS, while not expensive by military standards, restricts it non-warfare or commercial use and its participation in ongoing scientific research.  The development of asystem similar to AROSS, which can utilize commercial aircraft, would cost less to build and reduce operating cost by a factor of 4 to 5.BENEFITS: The successful transfer of AROSS technology to a system capable of being mounted in a commercial aircraftwill be an inexpensive oceanographic research asset.

In Phase 2 we propose to develop performance data on such filters that would provide NASA with the capability for sizing such filters for AWRS for diverse missions. The tasks also include improving the strength of the filters, providing them with biocidal capability to deter the growth of bacterial slime on the filter face, and demonstrating their capability to remove all forms of pathogens. A major task will be to develop a regenerable filter that uses minimal or no expendables. We will investigate their use as pre-filters for extending the life of reverse osmosis membranes that might be used in AWRS systems. An additional task would determine the feasibility of a microbial trap to maintain sterility of stored water without using iodine disinfectant. We will prove the viability of the filter by designing and testing a full-scale cartridge filter, suitable for NASA and for commercial sale.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In the 2002 Small Business Innovation Research Solicitation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency explicitly expressed interest in instruments that can accurately and reliably measure particulate emissions from vehicles. The availability of suitable instruments for measuring particulate emissions from engines and vehicles will benefit two broad categories of users: (1) it will directly help in the development of low emission engines, and (2) it will allow the appropriate government agencies to establish roadside checkpoints for monitoring the particulate emissions from vehicles and take enforcement actions against violators of environmental regulations. Laser-induced incandescence (LII) has emerged as a technique for measuring soot concentration and size (it appears that non-soot matter is evaporated and/or does not contribute to the signal). In the Phase I proposal, Artium Technologies, Inc., introduced a novel LII method for precisely determining the primary particle size and the number density of primary particles, in addition to particulate concentration in diesel exhausts. The proposed LII technique is capable of real-time particulate matter (PM) measurements over any engine transient operation. LII also has orders of magnitude more sensitivity than the gravimetric technique. The wide dynamic range and lower detection limit of LII make this technique a potentially preferred standard instrument for PM measurements. The Phase I effort clearly demonstrated the capabilities of the LII technique. The Phase I effort established the feasibility of building an instrument using this technique, and the proposed Phase II effort will further develop the technique and instrument as well as verify its suitability for PM measurement in a variety of applications. The Phase II Option effort will focus on cost reduction leading to the development of a roadside monitor as well as a portable version of the LII instrument.",

In addition we are looking atthe suitability of using plasma to replace existing expensive phase shifters in high power array antennas.  If this application is successful, it would significantly educe the size, number and cost of phase array antennas.  We are evaluating thefeasibility of storing and releasing electromagnetic energy through plasma windows,  which would allow rapid reconfigurability and greatly reduced side and back lobes.

        "abstract": "Abstract         65064    One of the factors that limit the productivity of DOE workers performing decontamination and decommissioning (D&D;) work is the heat stress induced by the protective clothing that must be worn.  Currently, there are no personal cooling products available that meet all of the needs.  The product that comes closest circulates cool water through a tube-lined garment worn by the worker under the protective clothing.  However, the cooling is supplied by blocks of ice that are heavy, have limited endurance, and impose significant logistic burdens on the operation.  This project will develop a complete cooling system using a previously developed miniature compressor.  The ice block and pumping unit would be replaced by the miniature vapor compression system.  In Phase I, the requirements for a personal cooling system for the DOEs D&D; activities were defined; a laboratory breadboard test system was designed, fabricated, and tested; and a packaged prototype unit was designed, assembled, and demonstrated.  In Phase II, prototypes will be field tested and evaluated, anti-contamination methods will be designed, and a hermetic compressor housing will be designed.  A manufacturability analysis will be conducted to prepare the cooling unit for production in Phase III.                 Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new cooling system should allow D&D; activities to proceed more efficiently, thus reducing cost and time to complete environmental restoration, while improving worker safety.  It would have commercial applications wherever heat stress is a problem, including bomb disposal, power plants, mining, steel mills, and firefighting",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Multichannel Scaler (MCS) electronics are currently used in lidar-based remote sensing applications for photon counting and histogramming functions. As front-end photon detector technology improves, the need for advanced, high-performance multichannel scalers will increase so as to not limit system performance. This proposal describes a high-speed, low power MCS chip design and circuit board that incorporates multiple, popular processor interfaces and other on-chip functionality such as storage memory. The proposed innovation will provide improved time resolution, smaller size, and lower power than comparable industry implementations. By integrating multiple interfaces in a single device, the proposed chip could be used as a building block for other MCS programs wherein specific program needs dictate size constraints, data transfer rates, or performance criteria. Phase-I provides a two-fold opportunity. First, it provides for a study to determine current industry trends and user needs and to trade-off design issues so as to provide the most useful functionality in the Phase-II development. Second, it provides for the development of a prototype in order to validate the conceptual basis for the final Phase-II proposal. The proposed innovation will aid in expanding the measurement capabilities of current airborne, spaceborne, and ground-based lidar systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The proposed research is intended to develop a new analysis for stresses and displacements in aerospace structures based on the combined conventional Displacement (Stiffness) Method and on a new formulation of the Force Method developed by the principal investigator. Since some of the elements used currently in the Displacement Method violate equations of stress equilibrium, an additional analysis by the Force Method in which element stresses do not violate the equations of equilibrium will provide bracketing on the solution (i.e. upper and lower bounds on stresses and displacements) thereby ensuring greater confidence in numerical results. Since the Force Method stresses are derived directly from internal forces they are more accurate than the stresses in the Displacement Method which requires differentiation of the displacement field within the element. The method will be illustrated on a typical multispar wing structure. The current project at this time will address only the overall concept of modifying existing computer codes; however, the actual modification of a specific commercial code or codes and subsequent commercialization will be addressed as a follow-on project after the completion of Phase I.",

Our hybrid SiC wafers are complementary to the existing bulk SiC wafers, and our value added is to increase the production volume and significantly reduce the cost oflow-defect larger-area substrates. With market acceptance, we will add products such as wafers of different conductivity types for near-dc high voltage/power devices (off-axes) and possibly even laser diodes (on-axes).  During Phase I, researchers atAstralux demonstrated a three-step process to make hybrid SiC wafers.  All Phase I milestones were reached, the goals accomplished and we are now ready for prototype development in Phase II.  An important feature of this program is to work closely with aSiC manufacturer to gain access to the best available SiC wafers and an AlGaN HEMT manufacturer who will test our substrates by growing/fabricating/testing RF devices and comparing the performance with devices made on conventional substrates.\"",

The benefits ofinteroperability between M&S; applications and Command and Control (C2) systems are becoming increasingly more evident as successful implementations are developed and used in Army experiments and exercises. As M&S; technology improves, more successful usehas been applied across domains and the benefit of interoperability, particularly in time, cost and effectiveness, has been demonstrated.  This Phase II effort will demonstrate a common data representation that will provide interoperability between M&Sapplications; and Army C2 systems for planning and decision support. The focus will be on Army C2 systems and constructive force-on-force simulation systems that are used for analysis, training, and as scenario drivers (e.g., OneSAF, Janus, Eagle, WARSIM2000).  ACS will use an innovative approach for this problem through specification of the C2 representation from a purely data perspective that is independent of a particular simulation architecture.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         NASA requires cooling of detectors for space telescopes. Detector temperatures as low as 0.05 K are being specified for a number of missions. A number of physics experiments proposed on the International Space Station require very low temperatures as well. Thus, NASA has identified a dilution refrigerator (DR) as a new technology requirement for its Fundamental Physics program.For a DR to operate it requires pre-cooling at 2K. Other than stored He II an ADR is the only suitable technique for achieving 2K in space. The ADR can serve to pre-cool a DR or a low-temperature ADR stage to achieve very low temperatures. It can also be integrated into a He II storage dewar to eliminate boil-off. This will reduce size and increase lifetime of such a system making long-duration experiments feasible.An ADR is designed to provide cooling at 2K. Cycling the magnetic refrigerant it is necessary to connect or isolate the refrigerant to/from the heat source and the heat sink. This is accomplished by employing novel heat switches. The efficiency is greatly affected by the performances of the heat switches. In the design the on and off conductances and the switching times of the heat switches are optimized to achieve a high efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Most buses, heavy-duty fleet vehicles, and construction and farm machinery are equipped with diesel engines. The diesel engine is an energy-efficient machine, but its exhaust emissions present a serious health and environmental problem. Drastic reductions in exhaust soot have been mandated throughout the world, including the recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandate to reduce smog-causing nitrogen oxides from these vehicles by 95 percent, and particulate matter (PM) by 90 percent. EPA proposes a PM emissions standard for new heavy-duty engines of 0.01 grams per brake-horsepower-hour in engine model year 2007. Soot emissions would be reduced by 110,000 tons each year when implemented. Current control technologies, such as catalytic converters, alternative fuels, and advanced diesel engine combustion systems are only partially effective in controlling the soot generated from diesel engines. Most of today's filter-based technologies experience high operational backpressures, causing unfavorable fuel consumption. The key to the acceptability of barrier filters for diesel exhaust is the ability of the filter to be regenerated, or cleared of trapped particles, so that the exhaust backpressure remains low. Atmospheric Glow Technologies resolved the inadequacy of filter regeneration by developing the Regenerative Plasma Filter (RPF) System. A metallic porous filter collects 90 percent of the soot from the diesel exhaust, which subsequently is oxidized with periodic exposures of the patented One Atmosphere Uniform Glow Discharge Plasma (OAUGDP). The molecular radicals produced by the plasma oxidize the captured soot at the ambient temperature of the exhaust stream (40-150 C), providing a safe means of filter regeneration at low energy costs without the need for catalysts or fuel additives. In Phase II, a full-scale commercial prototype will treat the entire exhaust stream from a 2.0 L diesel engine. The pressure drop across the filter and the mass distribution of penetrating particles will be measured. In addition, NOx, SOx, CO, and O3 concentrations will be measured to determine if secondary pollutants are generated. In 2010, the world market for motor vehicle exhaust emissions control technologies is expected to approach $72.3 billion. Approximately 330,600 heavy-duty diesel powered vehicles is are produced each year. Initial market entry estimates 5 percent, or 16,350, of these vehicles could be fitted with the RPF System, with a 20 percent market share 5 years out.",

The            proposed research aims to evaluate feasibility of continued development of           docosanol as a topical treatment for recurrent genital herpes simplex                infections. In order to achieve this objective, we have developed the following      specific aims:                                                                                                                                                            Aim 1: Develop a new formulation optimized for application to genital areas.

Phase II will expand on the Phase I outcome which showed that formulations           containing both docosanol and acyclovir provided maximal inhibition of HSV           disease in a cutaneous guinea pig model when compared to formulations                containing either docosanol or acyclovir alone.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The proposed research is designed to demonstrate the functionality, safety and effectiveness of an innovative disposable retractable trocar system intended for thoracostomy and chest tube insertion. When tension pneumothorax is suspected, the conventional clinical procedure is to perform a needle thoracostomy, in which a large needle is thrust blindly through the anterior chest to decompress the pneumothorax emergently. When pneumothoracies, hemothoracies, pleural effusions and empyemas occur, insertion of a chest tube is indicated, requiring a combination of sharp and blunt dissection to gain access to the pleural space. Our new device for chest access is similar in concept to retractable tracers used in pararascopic surgery. Preliminary testing in swine indicate chest tube thoracostomy with the retractable trocar is quicker and easier, results are more uniform, and it is thus presumably safer than techniques used currently. We propose to conduct a clinical study to evaluate device, safety, and effectiveness. This research is expected to lead to new and improved methods for emergency management of traumatic chest injury.",

They replicate the functionality of legacy business telephony-based systems. Our goal is to incorporate the power of the personal computer, Internet, multimedia, and videoconferencing into these systems.Phase I will test those technologies that promise to dramatically increase the effectiveness of performing telescience. Four collaboration areas have been identified: audio, video, conference management, and application sharing. Representative tasks and metrics for collaboration performance monitoring will be developed. Candidate capabilities will be prototyped and tested utilizing ground-based experimenter and educational groups. In Phase II the most promising capabilities will be incorporated into a prototype CONTACT system and tested with larger groups, including researchers performing live ISS telescience and NASA Quest educational audiences. The prototype system will be interfaced to IVoDS, demonstrating techniques for providing unsecured secondary users limited access to secure telescience conferences.",

Mechanized or conventional excavation techniques are used for construction of thesefacilities depending on the local conditions and their intended use. The penetrator weapons are designed to take out these underground structures. However, to protect against penetrator attack, these facilities are build at greater depth in hard rock.Prediction of performance of the penetrator weapons is contingent on thorough understanding of weapon-rock mass, including joint, fractures and other geologic features, interaction. Success of a planned mission depends on our ability to predict theperformance of the penetrator weapons by accounting for the site-specific characteristics of the geologic (host medium) and engineered (tunnel, cavity, etc) systems. The objective of this proposal is to develop and validate two generalized empiricalequations for penetrator weapons performance assessment and prediction of degree of damage to the engineered system. Both equations accept the characteristics of the penetrator weapons and site-specific characteristics of the geologic and engineeredsystems as input parameters. A series of physical modeling experiments at 1-g on scaled modeled tunnels are proposed for validation of the formulated penetrator \"response\" and \"degree-of-damage\" equations.\"",

A prototype system for a 5,000 lb aircraft with a speed range from 60 to 300 knots will be developed using an unmanned drop test vehicle and cargo aircraft. BRS will also work concurrently with several light jet manufacturers to define the parachute/aircraft interface requirements. These relationships are critical because it is clear that a practical emergency parachute system for this application must be an integral component of the aircraft and will require contributions from a variety of engineering disciplines.

If Phase I demonstrates feasibility, then Phase II will support the design of such a versatile device, featuring: (1) human-centric operation; (2) virtual energetic sports environments; and (3) a rich stream of quantification data for body motion trajectories, force/torque vectors along the trajectories, and power/energy profiles. Unlike any manipulator available today, the proposed device will achieve the normally incompatible requirements of: (1) human-level strength and (2) reach but also (3) precise controllability and (4) true fail-safe operation - all in a (5) lightweight package. Even Barrett's high-performance WAM arm, which is haptic and has higher force capability than the popular Phantom (sold by Barrett's licensee, Sensable Technologies) cannot meet this set of requirements without a technology breakthrough as significant as the innovation presented within this proposal.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The flight envelope for X-34 ranges from subsonic to hypersonic with altitudes up to 50 miles. Designing a guidance law that performs across this broad flight envelope presents several challenges. Robustness to uncertain aerodynamics is of paramount importance because of the sparse amount of wind tunnel and flight test data that exists for reusable launch vehicles at hypersonic Mach numbers. The need to compensate for potential control surface failures imposes additional guidance requirements. Barron Associates, Inc. (BAI) has teamed with Orbital Sciences Corporation to develop control and guidance systems that can reconfigure in real time to significantly increase the reliability of reusable launch vehicles. An innovative modular architecture, presently under development, will be used to reshape trajectories on-line. We believe that leveraging this concurrent effort is a main strength of the proposal. The approach autonomously identifies the closed-inner-loop dynamics and adapts the guidance for off-nominal performance. In Phase I, a modification of the existing X-34 energy management approach will be investigated. A more formal optimization technique developed and matured by BAI will also be considered. Studies will focus on aerodynamic uncertainties and control failures that primarily affect lateral-directional maneuvering capabilities, which are critical in managing vehicle energy for unpowered descent.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We analyze a new, noncontact approach for sensing the topography of an optic. It offers (1) sub-nanometer accuracy; (2) several mm or more of dynamic range; and (3) accommodation of large surface slopes and structure. We add autofocusing to a focusing distance measuring interferometer to keep the beam focused on the test piece. The measurement is unaffected by small autofocusing errors. Thus, the range is extended to the lens-servoing range; the servoing has loose tolerances; and the sub-nanometer accuracy is preserved. In another innovation, we add coma (by tilting the lens) to enlarge the focused spot on the test piece to be immune to surface defects. The coma is canceled on the return trip through the lens, preserving wavefront quality. These innovations can greatly improve the optical profiling of astronomical and space optics.Our Phase I project was successful - we arrived at a workable design including mechanics, optics, actuation, and servoing architecture. In Phase II we have two main technical (and programmatic) objectives: (1) develop and demonstrate a potentially commercially viable extended range probe; and (2) use a set of those probes in a specific instrumental configuration to demonstrate explicitly the ability to perform sub-nanometer profilometry.",

The system would have a redundant active electroniccomponent, which would provide alternative audible and visual alarm features.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Drug metabolism problems such as production of toxic metabolites and unfavorable pharmacokinetics cause almost half of all drug candidate failures during clinical trials. Although glucuronidation is one of the most important routes of drug metabolism, the broad and overlapping substrate specificity of the hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) that catalyze glucuronidation remains poorly understood. Thus, pharmaceutical companies have an immediate need for better methods to determine whether their potential drug candidates will be glucuronidated, and if so by which UGT isoform. In the longer term, it is hoped that fully defining the \"chemical space\" recognized by each of the key hepatic UGTs will lead to in silico metabolism screening approaches. The proposed Phase II studies will generate the molecular tools needed to address these needs. The key hepatic UGT isoforms will be expressed, purified and incorporated into HTS assays that can be used to rapidly screen large numbers of diverse chemicals for binding and metabolism by isolated UGT isoforms. These novel molecular assays will fulfill the immediate need for improved preclinical drug glucuronidation assessment, and will accelerate efforts to delineate the key determinants of substrate binding and catalysis for the hepatic UGTs, thereby enabling faster and more cost-effective drug development.",

Paddle sports are one of the fastest growing recreational activities. Current canoe seating products cradle the paddler in a flexible fabric or plastic bucket but do not provide the stable base of support required for efficient, independent and equal participation by users with movement limitations. The universal canoe seating system will support the pelvis, torso and legs creating a stable base of support that will increase upper body function, balance, endurance, strength and movement efficiency. Technological innovations will mechanically link paddler and canoe, enable personal cushion use and enhance the function and effectiveness of paddlers with movement, strength, balance, positioning or endurance limitations. Phase I results demonstrated enhanced paddler strength,  comfort and balance without compromising safety. Phase II user testing will demonstrate the functional benefits of the seat through comparative measures of fit, support, user satisfaction, paddling strength and endurance. The durability and safety of the seat will be established through strength and load testing. With the new seat, individuals, outdoor recreation programs, rental companies and outfitters will have a system that enables safe, effective and equal canoeing opportunities for people of all abilities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         NASA is interested in large, coherent, primary mirrors with good optical figure. An approach now followed by all major observatories is to make the large mirror of smaller segments that are phased together. Hexagons 1 meter in diameter are a possible segment size. Over one hundred one meter segments are required even for a 10 meter diameter primary. Segments will have a long focal length, f/20 or more, even if the resultant large mirror is f/2 or less. Means for making and measuring high quality, low scatter, long focal length, large adaptive optic deformable mirrors economically is thus greatly needed, as stated in the subtopic. This proposal presents one solution. Effects of turbulence and air layering are largely eliminated by making most of the long focal length path virtual. A technique for economically superpolishing large mirrors for low scatter is presented and will be domonstrated. A precision fiber optic interferometer said to increase the measuring precision of commercial interferometers by an order of magnitude will be evaluated in Phase I. Its use on large, long focal length superpolished mirrors measured using virtual path length techiques will be demonstrated in the Phase II program.",

This innovation, termed Venturi Off-Set Technology (VOSTtm), addresses four critical needs for effective storage, transfer and use of cryogens in aerospace. These are: thermal isolation to minimize heat leakage,low pressure drop to accommodate high flows without cavitation, minimal mass and space requirement due to low profile, and adaptability to electromechanical actuation. Existing cryogenic valves require elaborate insulation measures to mitigate heat leakage through actuator stems, they are also characterized by: high pressure drop at high flows, large mass to envelope ratio, and high actuation torques. VOSTtm valves eliminate actuator contact with internal wetted parts, potentially improving thermal and fluid containment characteristics necessary for densified propellants while maintaining high flow. VOST valves are suited for electromechanical actuation due to low torque requirements. These features combine to improve valve reliability necessary for use of cryogens in Earth, space, and extra-terrestrial environments. Phase 1 will determine the feasibility of adapting the innovative VOST tm design for cryogenic service. Tasks include material evaluation, sealing technology investigation, performance modeling and a conceptual design. Phase II will prototype, test, evaluate and deliver a cryogenic valve for system testingand integration.",

Our proposed \"Test       Kit\" is based on administering a feeding of infant formula containing a              suitably labeled 13C-triglyceride (TG), a trace amount of the nonabsorbable          marker dysprosium chloride (DyC1-3) and the visual marker Brilliant Blue             followed by laboratory analysis of Dy and 13C-Excess in one or more sample(s)        of stool containing the visual marker. The research conducted during Phase-I of      this grant has led to the selection of 1,3-(13C-2) dipalmitoyl, 2-lauryl             glycerol (P*LP*) as the most suitable TG* for applications in infants. During        Phase II of the project, we propose to conduct clinical protocols with cystic        fibrosis and healthy infants in order to: (1) define the parameters of the           expected linear correlation between fecal excretion of P*LP* and fecal fat, (2)      demonstrate the significance of this novel method in medical management of           infants with steatorrhea, and (3) obtain research data necessary for the             manufacture of a safe and noninvasive \"Test Kit\" for accurate assessment of          steatorrhea in infants. The \"Test Kit\" has widespread applications in clinical       management of infants with a wide range of disorders leading to steatorrhea.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An innovative fluorescence system for sensing biomolecular interactions was developed in Phase I that is based on total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF). The main advantages of this system are integrated microfluidics and a design that allows rapid replacement of TIRF sensor chip. The feasibility of building a highly sensitive and versatile TIRF biosensor instrument was successfully demonstrated in Phase I. In Phase II, we will design and build a complete turn-key TIRF instrument. The proposed instrument will be equipped with integrated fluidics, an automated sample handling module and a precision mechanism for rapid replacement of TIRF sensor chips. A variety of inexpensive TIRE sensor chips enclosed in cartridges will be available for convenient immobilization of different biomolecules. In this manner, the TIRF biosensor instrument will be designed for routine investigation of biomolecular interactions. During year one of Phase II, we propose to build five units of the TIRF biosensor instrument. In year two, the TIRF instrument will be tested in laboratories of our consultants and in our own lab. At the end of Phase II a fine-tuned industrial prototype wilt be obtained. The TIRF biosensor instrument will be constructed and tested in close collaboration with C&L; Instruments and our consultants.  A TIRF biosensor instrument is a much-needed tool for studies related to structural genomics, proteomics and other fields where detailed knowledge of biomolecular interactions are important. Since the proposed instrument will transform difficult TIRF experiments into routine measurements, the TIRF biosensor has the potential to revolutionize studies in many fields, including cancer research, biomaterials studies, drug discovery, cell signaling, genomics and proteomics, nanotechnology, immunoassay and vaccine development.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this SBIR is to develop an improved full PSG / CPAP titration device for the home and the lab. Despite numerous improvements in data manipulation and analysis, the patient interface responsible for the critical role of generating the inputs has received little attention and remains unoptimal. Current PSG and CPAP titration patient interfaces use sensors and conventional electrode assemblies that are too busy, cumbersome to wear and generate indirect or noisy data. The proposed device will improve signal sensitivity, patient comfort and reliability by developing a new dedicated patient interface. The proposed device will incorporate three innovative features: I) miniaturized 23 channel headwom amplifier system for EEG/EOG, 2) non-contacting upper airway microsensors that plug in-line with the air hose proximal to the mask, and 3) a small recorder unit with novel micro data storage medium and wireless data transmission capability. BIOMEC will capitalize on technologies being developed for other applications. Although the primary targeted market is the lab, in-home studies will also benefit from such a device. Compactness and wearability will make the proposed device the first in-home sleep disorders monitor with in-lab capabilities. In Phase I, we tested the feasibility of embedded microsensors, miniaturized wearable hardware and micro data storage. In Phase II, we will complete the hardware design by integrating all the components together, and conduct clinical studies on 12 patients. The final product promises to set the standard for a new class of full PSG and CPAP titration for the lab and home.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The proposed device will have the capability of in-lab PSG devices but with the mobility and ease of use of home devices.  The commercial potential include lab and home screening and monitoring of sleep disorders such as OSA, and isomnia.  The total number of sleep labs is expected to exceed 2500 in the US alone.  The total market for sleep diagnostic products is estimated at $104 million and is growing at 8% annually.  One of the biggest drivers is the untapped OSA population, which is estimated at over 11 million.  there is a huge need for improved diagnostic devices that generate sensitive recordings in a more comfortable patient interface.  Also, a more compact and reliable patient interface will permit home use, which is one of the high growth market segments due to lower cost and more convenient procedure setting.",

Currently available reagents to disinfect fluid delivery lines are either hazardous to humans, unpleasant to work with, environmentally unsafe, or corrosive to expensive hemodialysis equipment at the required contact times. Biomedical Development Corporation is developing a unique disinfectant to improve the quality of water and dialysate circulating through hemodialysis systems. The disinfectant is biocidal against a broad spectrum of organisms and operates as a biofilm reducing agent in clinical water delivery systems. Preliminary studies demonstrate that the disinfectant is an effective antimicrobial, even in the presence of biofilm, is nontoxic, and inexpensive to produce. This study will involve adaptation of the disinfectant for clinical use, and include extensive safety and efficacy testing in preparation for approval and use in hemodialysis fluid delivery systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project continues the development of new thermally activable reagents for bonding microbicidal polymers to inner surfaces of a variety of opaque tubing materials, initiated in Phase I under the Advanced Materials and Manufacturing (AM) topic, Surface Engineering subtopic (F). Materials have been developed with bulk physical properties needed for transport of aqueous mixtures; however, the development of biofilm on the wet surfaces is a continuing serious problem in the dental, pharmaceutical, food processing, and marine transport industries. Surface modification of waterlines could decrease the formation of biofilm while retaining the desired bulk properties of the tubing. Photochemistry has been proven commercially successful in enhancing the surface properties of medical devices with radical-based surface modification initiated by RF plasma or ultraviolet light. However, these energy sources are not effective for modifying the inner surfaces of opaque tubes such as waterlines used with dental units and plumbing in pharmaceutical plants. This project is designed to develop latent-reactive radical generators activatible with thermal energy which penetrates these opaque devices. This innovative approach to scheduled activation of radical generators will provide a method to modify inert surfaces which cannot be activated with external light or plasma sources. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation remain a major cost and threat to human health and product quality for dental and pharmaceutical industries, health care and public lodging, and marine vessel utilization. Successful development of microbicidal and antifouling coating technology for the luminal surface of opaque transport and storage vessels for aqueous liquid ingestible products, constitute an incremental market size of tens of millions of dollars, not subject to current commercial coating technology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         There are many data acquisition systems available for neuroscientists interested in multi-channel neurophysiology but all use proprietary, independently-developed file formats for the acquired data. This creates several problems including difficulties in sharing data between laboratories and poor interoperability between equipment, data processing tools and spike classification software from different vendors. Moreover, neuroscientists wanting to develop their own data acquisition hardware or analysis software are forced to support a limited set of proprietary formats or create their own. In Phase I, Bionic Technologies, Inc. will work with all interested data acquisition companies and representative users to develop an open, industry-standard file format for neurophysiological data, create a web- based user forum to support this standard, and provide a C/C++ code library for importing and exporting data in the open format. In Phase II, the usability of the format will be increased by the development of public-domain, open-source software tools for: importing/exporting the data in various programming languages and between a variety of analysis environments; editing, splicing, annotating and reviewing experiment data in the standard file format; generating data files for analysis from simulation environments, and classifying spike waveforms with classical or custom algorithms. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The open file format for neural data developed in Phase I and the neural data management tools developed in Phase II will be made freely available to everyone on a neutral, non-affiliated web site. Researchers will also be able to use this site to exchange information and user- developed tools and techniques within an Open Source environment. Bionic Technologies, Inc. and other neuroscience equipment manufacturers will benefit from the increased research activity, and hence increased sales, enabled by this program.",

Specific objectives include: 1) to optimize enzyme immobilization on cotton cloth and other support materials, 2) to evaluate the proposed two-step enzyme reaction for GOS production from whey lactose, 3) to optimize nanofiltration for separation of GOS from lactose, glucose, and galactose, 4) to develop a novel process with integrated enzyme reaction and NF separation of GOS, 5) to produce GOS product samples for further product development and testing, and 6) to develop marketing strategies and business plan for commercialization. The proposed process would produce a high-value product (more than $5/lb) that can be used as a health-promoting food ingredient and dietary supplement from the surplus whey permeate and lactose ($0.18 to $0.4 per lb) currently produced in the dairy industry. The market for GOS is at $200 million per year in Japan alone. The large, potential U.S. and worldwide markets could exceed $1 billion. Thus, a cost-effective enzyme technology to produce GOS from whey lactose should increase the product value and reduce the waste (whey permeate) disposal problem facing the dairy industry.",

While axillary lymph node dissection remains the gold standard of care for staging of breast cancer, over 70% of women with small breast tumors who undergo axillary dissection are found to have negative axillary nodes. The proposed minimally invasive biopsy system could spare the morbidity of axillary node dissection for over 32,000 women who fall into this category each year in the U.S. In Phase I, we established the technical feasibility of accurately identifying and localizing sentinel nodes. In Phase II, we will demonstrate the clinical feasibility of safely extracting intact sentinel nodes through a very small incision in the axilla, and compare the clinical efficacy of the proposed system to axillary dissection as a staging tool. The proposed system integrates spatially correlated ultrasound and nuclear medicine imaging technologies, and computer driven, specialized biopsy devices, to provide a standardized platform for minimally invasive percutaneous sentinel node biopsy. We believe that this computerized platform will lead to more widespread use of sentinel node biopsy for clinically appropriate patients.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The overall goal of the proposed program is to demonstrate the technical and scientific feasibility of combining the biopulping and fiber loading technologies at a pilot-scale simulating industrial conditions to minimize the initial research and development costs. The combined technology will save electrical energy, improve paper quality (strength and optical properties), and reduce the environmental impact of pulping cost-effectively compared to the present process of producing the same products. Biopulping, defined as the treatment of wood chips with a lignin-degrading fungus prior to mechanical pulping, is a new technology for papermaking. In this process, at least 30% electrical energy is saved and paper strength properties are improved. Unfortunately, the process reduces the brightness and opacity of the resulting paper. High brightness and high opacity are critical for the production of high quality papers, particularly when the trend in the pulp and paper industry is towards producing lightweight papers. We have also developed another new technology called fiber loading. In this technology, calcium carbonate is deposited as filler within, on the surface of, and outside the fibers. The process improves brightness, opacity, and bonding strength, and reduces energy consumption during drying. Thus, this fiber loading technology has the potential of overcoming both the problems associated with biopulping. During Phase I, the technical feasibility of combining the two newly developed technologies was established at a laboratory scale.",

Many of these designs employ a model-based approach in which targets,background, and target/background interactions are modeled.  A central tenet of this approach is that the large number of target, sensor, and background combinations found in realistic scenarios precludes the use of automatic target recognition (ATR)algorithms that rely solely on pre-computed templates or \"brute force\" model matching.  These approaches can be costly and the form factor impractical for a variety of military applications.  As an alternative to model-based approaches, feature-based ATRsystems have also been investigated whereby target and scene features are extracted from the data for target detection and classification.  The SBIR Phase I program demonstrated a feature-based ATR system that exploited evolutionary algorithm (EA)technology.  The ATR system accepted a feature vector extracted from synthetic LADAR imagery and output a target classification decision with a high probability of correct classification.  This Phase II effort will expand the Phase I results by computingand processing features extracted from real LADAR imagery that has been collected by the Army and Air Force using a variety of LADAR sensors.

The implant consists of a drug-free, biodegradable polymer core surrounded by a drug-containing shell, which provides efficient drug delivery. Such implants will biodegrade if left in place for more than a year, yet they can be surgically removed before the end of a year if necessary. With no need to keep track of daily pills or weekly patches, and with little reason to fear an unpleasant removal episode, such implants should provide a welcome new form of sustained hormone replacement therapy. Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of delivering estradiol and levonorgestrel at acceptable rates from the same implants. Phase II will now modify the core polymer to accelerate degradation, improve production methods, characterize promising designs in vitro, and confirm performance in rabbits.",

Such delivery should foster drowsiness, restful sleep, and alert waking more effectively than available oral dose forms and would also be more easily administered to impaired or uncooperative subjects. Because transdermal melatonin provides non-invasive delivery of a human hormone at natural levels, it should not lead to tolerance or harmful side effects. Transdermal melatonin may be of value to night shift workers, elderly individuals who lack an endogenous high-amplitude melatonin cycle, long distance air travelers, and those with sleep or seasonal affect disorders. In Phase I GMP patches were made and characterized, stability studies were initiated, a human Clinical Protocol was developed with the Brigham and Women?s Sleep Center in Boston, MA, and a draft IND was prepared. Phase II will conduct a human clinical study aimed at establishing safety and testing efficacy under well-controlled conditions.

In those applications, large amounts of data are generated and must be stored and processed for each scene, makingreal-time decision making a challenge.  In the Phase II project, we will evaluate and select adaptive target segmentation and matching algorithms studied in Phase I which reduce the processing time.  The algorithms to be evaluated are adaptive, robust toscale and rotation of the target in the image, environmental degradation of the input scene, target placed in clutter, and sensor noise.  The methods used are based on wavelet theory and genetic search paradigms.  Another problem encountered in anoperational imaging system is the issue of signal processing hardware.  The hardware is a compact FPGA design placed on a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Mezzanine Card with externally linked memory. In the Phase II project, we will implement thealgorithms on FPGA hardware and evaluate system performance. In this effort, BJ Information Technologies will partner with Lockheed Martin to provide significant improvements to existing USAF image-based target detection and tracking systems. At projectend, a demonstration system consisting of algorithms and hardware will be provided to USAF.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Triploidy offers an excellent opportunity for increased profitability and competitiveness of hatchery-based pearl farming in the U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands and Hawaii, for little additional cost. Techniques developed in Phase I for inducing triploidy in black-lip pearl oysters (Pinctada margaritifera) using Cytochalasin B and 6-DMAP were very successful ? up to 100% in several cases. These excellent results confirm the feasibility of producing triploid pearl oysters. Phase II will address three critical issues for commercializing this technology: (1) The value of triploidy to commercial pearl farms will be assessed through growth and seeding trials using 2N and 3N oysters from Phase I experiments. (2) Techniques will be refined for large-scale production of triploid animals in commercial pearl oyster hatcheries, and (3) Tetraploid pearl oysters will be attempted by crossing 2N and 3N oysters, or by other innovative means.",

DOD has been working for many years on modeling of the individual effects of each of these threats ontarget damage. The purpose of this project is to model the combined effects of multiple threats and their interactions on target damage.  Such interactions have the potential to inflict damage greater than the sum of that produced by each threatindividually.   We will develop engineering models of these interactions for both air and light ground vehicles.  The models will include synergistic effects such as target response to the combined impact of fragments and blast, and sequential effects suchas fragment impact followed by hydrodynamic ram, then fire and thermal damage. The models will be validated against test data obtained from the literature and from a series of critical tests to be conducted during this project.  The models will beintegrated with existing vulnerability assessment models to improve their predictive capabilities.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Commercially available tents and vestibules are relatively inaccessible to people who use mobility devices or those with dexterity limitations. The objectives of this project are to develop and test tent-related technology which results in a vestibule and a combined tent and vestibule accessible to people of varying abilities, including people with mobility, dexterity, cognitive and visual impairments. The universal vestibule will be able to be used with a wide range of 2-6 person tents. Its zipperless, accessible door will enable individuals to quickly and independently get out of the rain. Inside the vestibule, there will be enough headroom for people to sit upright, for others to assist in transfers, and room to maneuver a wheelchair. Secondary applications will be its use as a stand-alone, accessible, private shelter for a commode, gear storage, or as a screen house in group camping situations. A means for attaching the vestibule to a stationary vehicle will also be developed. It is anticipated that the features and benefits of the universal vestibule will appeal to a wide range of campers, not just those with disabilities. A 2-3 person accessible tent/vestibule will also be developed. The structure will include a vestibule area and a sleeping area, with insect-proof netting separating the two areas. Hardware and frames developed for both structures will enable campers who are standing upright, seated in a wheelchair, or sitting on the ground to assemble the tent. Window closures and the insect barrier between the sleeping and vestibule portions of the tent will be easy to open and close by those with limited dexterity, as well as those at ground level. The overall technical objectives include structural stability, withstanding wind and rain, and insect resistance. Production and manufacturing objectives include optimization of the designs for ease of manufacturing and control of costs, development of processes and specifications to ensure finished goods meet established quality criteria, identification of potential domestic or overseas manufacturers, and identification of existing tent manufacturers who may license the technology. Information dissemination activities regarding the project will increase the awareness of the outdoor industry, camping programs, and disability communities. The outdoor industry will be made aware of the existence of campers with disabilities, and everyone will be made aware of new technology available to better serve their needs.",

This procedure is labor intensive, very expensive, and time consuming.  This project will develop an analytical instrument to provide sensitive, accurate, and precise measurements of stable carbon isotopes and total carbon dioxide in ambient air in real time in the field.  The instrument will be based on an emerging technology called cavity ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS) and employ telecommunications-type tunable diode lasers, fiber optics, and the latest developments in microelectronics.  Phase I demonstrated the ability to accurately measure the ratio of stable carbon isotopes, carbon 13 to carbon 12, and total CO2 concentration with very high accuracy and sensitivity, using a platform that can be developed into a low-cost and manufacturable instrument.  In Phase II, a set of advanced prototype instruments, optimized for this application and suitable for field deployment, will be designed and built.  The instruments will be tested against current analytical techniques in both laboratory and field operation settings, and will establish the usefulness of CRDS in atmospheric sampling applications related to biosphere-atmosphere CO2 exchange.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most human protein therapeutics require frequent dosing due to rapid clearance of the proteins from the body. Development of second generation protein pharmaceuticals that can be injected less frequently is of considerable interest to patients and healthcare providers. We propose to create long-acting forms of IL-11 and TPO by creating larger versions of these proteins with longer circulating half-lives. These modified IL-11 and TPO proteins will possess biological activities equal or superior to natural IL-I 1 and TPO in vivo, but will require less frequent dosing, on the order of once every one to three weeks, rather than daily. During Phase I we constructed IL-11 and TPO fusion proteins and demonstrated that certain of them possess near wild type in vitro bioactivities. We also demonstrated that one of the IL-11 fusion proteins has a significantly longer half-life than IL-11 in a rat. During Phase II, we will manufacture sufficient quantities of the modified proteins for more extensive pharmacokinetic and animal efficacy studies. The improved characteristics of the novel IL-11 and TPO proteins will reduce the amount of protein required per patient, improve patient compliance and quality of life and result in considerable cost savings to patients and healthcare providers. These proteins will find utility in treating thrombocytopenia resulting from cancer chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Non-mechanical beamsteering eliminates the need for massive optomechanical components to steer the field of view of optical systems. This benefit is to come in the form of compact, low-power, light-weight optical phased arrays that provide better control with greater flexibility in their steering capability than their mechanical counterparts. Currently, high-speed, high-resolution, fully-programmable non-mechanical beamsteerers with good optical efficiency do not exist forcing system developers to use mechanical systems for controlling the field of view of an optical system. This proposal offers a means to correct this deficiency. Recent advances in VLSI foundry processes have made possible high-resolution, light-efficient backplanes capable of driving electro-optic modulators with high-voltage signals. The high-voltage signals provide the excitation to achieve sub-millisecond response times with a wave of phase modulation. By combining high-speed phase modulators with high-voltage VLSI backplanes, compact spatial light modulators become available for the various applications that need this type of performance such as optical signal routing or beamsteering, active diffractive optics and adaptive wavefront correction.",

Applications such as optical correlation, holographic storage, and multi-spot beam-steering would all benefit from the development of a very high-resolution high-speed multi-level SLM. Today Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS) offers several high-speed liquid crystal SLMs custom designed for use in high-end optical systems. The most advanced SLM is our 512x512 pixel multi-level SLM that can operate at frame rates exceeding 1000-Hz. However, many applications require even higher resolution to maximize the processing gain achieved from the highly parallel nature of the SLM. BNS proposes to develop a multi-level 1024x1024 SLM with 5-micron pixels and 1000-Hz frame rate. In Phase I, BNS developed a conceptual design for the system. The Phase II effort completes the development by fabricating and testing the 1024x1024 SLM system.",

Boundless' patented structural battery technology is based ondual-function carbon composite anodes.  High specific power and high power density is achieved by the following means:  Battery active material is spread in very thin layers relative to the thickness of the bulk current collector, yielding low resistive losses and minimizing heat generation at high discharge rates.   Battery electrodes are constructed in a corrugated configuration and spread out within a large volume, forming cooling channels adjacent to heat sources.      Carbon composite electrodes are used for structural support as well as for energy storage, enabling high ratios of current collector to active material without excessive mass. The carbon composite is also highly thermally conductive and simplifiesthermal management.     Replacing the inert structure with a structural battery allows the battery mass to be discounted to account for structural utility, further enhancing effective specific power.Thermal imaging of lithium-ion cells done in Phase I demonstrated temperatures >90oC for a spiral design versus <28oC for a flat cell design, thus proving feasibility of this approach.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65101   Generation IV nuclear power plants will require comprehensive and cost-effective methods for monitoring plant wire and cable. Current methods primarily focus on correlating mechanical or chemical laboratory measurements of samples retrieved from installed wire and cable in the plant with acceleration-aged data.  However, physical access to samples is often difficult and time-intensive, and laboratory testing is expensive.  This project will utilize conductive composites of wire and cable insulation material to provide a simple, non-destructive, in-situ electrical measurement correlating to the age-related degradation of the insulation, thereby providing an indication of the remaining life of the cable.  Phase I demonstrated feasibility by performingaccelerated age trials of the conductive composite, measuring the electrical resistivity and mechanical properties as the composite aged, and equating resistivity with the mechanical properties of the insulation material.  Phase II will expand accelerated age testing to composite age sensors of several candidate insulation materials for Generation IV nuclear power plants.  Analysis of data resulting from the age trials will provide the basis for a methodology to relate simple non-destructive resistivity measurements of the age sensors to the mechanical properties and remaining life of the insulation.  Finally, prototype wire or cable incorporating a distributed age sensor will be developed.                  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  An electrical in situ approach should take cable condition monitoring from the laboratory into the field, resulting in reduced cost compared to present methods.  Also, eliminating sample retrieval would improve personnel and equipment safety, and allow the condition monitoring of otherwise inaccessible areas.  This approach should also have application to monitoring the remaining life of other polymeric materials such as seals, gaskets, and structural components.",

Current metal pretreatment processes for painting and adhesive bonding perform well, but generate tremendous volumes of wastes, including hexavalent chromium and various inorganic acids. To obtain performance superior to the current state-of-the-art wet chemical surface treatments, the surface chemistry and morphology of the plasma polymerized films need to be tailored for specific interactions with the adhesive. Effects of variables including substrate chemistry, monomer chemistry, and ion kinetic energy on surface chemistry and morphology of plasma polymers will be determined. Then, the effect of the resulting structure on the strength and durability of adhesive joints will be determined. By combining in-situ analytical techniques with accelerated aging and mechanical testing of adhesive specimens, a superior, environmentally benign process based on plasma polymerization will be developed and commercialized. These primers will have well understood morphologies and surface compositions tailored to the adhesive chemistry through control of the deposition conditions and/or chemical derivitization of the plasma polymer surface.",

The prototype paste adhesive has already exceeded F-22 bonded joint thermal and electrical conductivity requirements with a metallic filler that will preclude galvanic corrosion of the aluminum substrate.  The key Phase II challengewill be developing this paste to meet the unique F-22 assembly requirements necessary for maximizing production labor and cycle time savings.  Significant improvements in current needle dispensed paste processing will be essential in making this adhesive aviable candidate: rapid large area dispense coverage (up to 1 square foot in a few minutes); maintaining tight tolerance component location and moderate adhesive strength of large bond areas during a fast pre-cure stage; and maintaining an easy reworkcapability (< 5 lbs. force@ < 130 C for > 10 cm2 bond area).  Using metallic coated fibers oriented in the z-axis, the prototype film adhesive came close to meeting the bonded joint conductivity requirements.  Phase II development will use a heaviermetallic coating to ensure sufficient conductivity margin.  The key Phase II challenge will be to modify the polymeric adhesive formulation so that a low pressure (<15 psi) applied during componen",

The principle problem to be addressed is how to configure a head-mounted display that provides the increased field of view and approximate imagecharacteristics of I-PNVG while at the same time approximating the weight, center of gravity, and form, fit, and function characteristics of I-PNVG.  Results of the phase I program will be analyzed and leveraged to develop a system design that isproducible and of commercial quality.  Existing and emerging miniature display technologies will be evaluated to determine which technology offers the best balance between image quality characteristics and impact to system weight and center of gravity.Particular attention will be paid to the commercial viability of the display technologies.  The development path will result in fabrication, analysis, and evaluation of advanced operational prototypes, followed by a detailed design phase resulting indelivery of at least two commercial-quality systems.\"",

Sheet beam devices could potentially provide equivalent or higher levels for RF power with reduced space charge, hence, they could operate at lower voltages.  By implementing a control and shadow grid, the requirement for pulse compression could be eliminated.  This project will develop and test a gridded, sheet beam electron gun for high-power RF applications.  Phase I modeled the optical performance of the emitted electron beam and developed a design that meets the requirements for 415-kV,80-MW sheet beam klystron.  The design for the electron gun included the gridded emitter, grid support, heat shields, heater package, and mounting structure.  In Phase II, the electrical design of the gun will be optimized, and a complete thermomechanical analysis of the gun will be performed.  The gun will be built, tested, and delivered to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center for use in their sheet beam klystron.

When gases are used, patients must keep their head in a face down      position for 2 weeks after surgery. This causes considerable discomfort in most      patients, and not uncommonly, is the most difficult hurdle in post-operative         management. Additionally, gas is associated with ocular complications including      cataract and glaucoma. Silicone oil has the advantage that the patient is not        required to position face down for more that one day post-operatively. However,      unlike gas, which is slowly reabsorbed into the blood stream, silicone must be       surgically removed from the eye as a secondary procedure to prevent similar          ocular complications. To address these problems, Calhoun Vision, Inc. is             developing, evaluating, and refining biodegradable polymers for the closure of       retinal breaks. In the proposed research we will optimize non-toxic polymer          formulations that can close retinal breaks in an experimental system. We will        assess the toxicity, duration of attachment to the retinal, and effectiveness        of several polymer formulations. Polymer composition will be varied to achieve       the optimal non-toxic biodegradable polymer formulation.",

Many such infections are not curable with      existing medications, and preventive vaccines are not yet feasible for these         complex parasites. The long-term goal of this project is to identify new             anti-nematode compounds that will fulfill this human health need. Nuclear            receptor (NR) transcription factors are proven targets of effective and              commercially successful drugs and insecticides, but have not yet been exploited      as anthelmintic targets. Compounds that selectively interfere with the               functions of NRs essential for nematode viability will provide leads for the         development of novel anthelmintics for the control of important human parasitic      nematode infections. The results of Phase I identified parasitic nematode            orthologs of NRs that have essential functions in C. elegans and established a       cell-based assay for chemical modulators of nematode NR activity. Phase II will      exploit the knowledge and tools acquired during Phase I to deploy a proprietary      battery of high-throughput screens for isolating compounds that alter nematode       NR function. Secondary assays will be used to select those active compounds          that are most promising for further development in Phase III.

In this document the results of the successful completion of a Phase I SBIR are outlined. The fundamental operation of the CaBER's component parts is supported by data that validates the chosen components and verifies the suitability of the design. In addition, sample data from model fluids will be used to both illustrate the functionality of the CaBER and to highlight the broad applicability of the instrument. Ongoing developments of the CaBER include more robust software analysis, cheaper manufacturing costs and a more intuitive user interface. These improvements will result in an instrument that is invaluable to industry in both a research laboratory and a process control environment. Currently there is only one commercially available extensional rheometer and a handful of academic rheometer designs. By providing a virtually unique tool for the determination of extensional viscosity in a freely draining fluid thread, this instrument will fill a segment of the instrumentation field that as here to fore been neglected.",

The particular challenge in moving a DNA/PLGA formulation through thepreclinical stages to clinical trials lies in the translation of dose/response information from a very small animal model (rodent) to a larger animal model (primate). However, the attractive of particulate PLGA dose forms is based on their capacity toelicit immune responses based on their long-term persistence in the neighborhood of antigen presenting cells. Therein lies the thrust of optimization for vaccine efficacy-titration of the dose/response behavior of PLGA particulates.     Phase II work will utilize the team structure established in Phase I.

Polymer-based prototype electrical devices were found to be stable toward simulated physiological conditions and cyclic current pulsing. The Phase II program will extend the benefits of these systems to the fabrication of more complex devices such as multi-poled cuff electrodes for chronic peripheral nerve stimulation and recording. An expanded test plan would include development of advanced device fabrication methods and extensive testing of the prototype neural prostheses for electrical response, tissue compatibility, and durability in chronic implantation applications. The optimized elastomeric electrodes will be characterized for biocompatibility, stability and electrical properties. Methodology will be developed for fabricating prosthetic electrodes for extensive in vitro pulsing studies and acute animal testing. Finally, test protocols for the new electrode products will be established in an effort to obtain FDA approval.\r      The commercial applications of this project will be in the area of biomedical devices and systems that serve the needs of disabled individuals following stroke or spinal cord injury.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         It is proposed to develop a directional solidification system equipped with a novel sensor to maintain a separation gap between the crucible containing the charge and the solidifying charge. The interaction of crucible wall and the solidifying charge during growth of single crystals of electronics materials is known to influence generation of a myriad of defects with concomitant deleterious effect on the performance of these materials in device structures ranging from detectors to telecommunication equipment. The goal of this proposal is to develop the enabling technology for sensor-based feedback controlled growth of detached semiconductor crystals. The Phase I of this activity will focus on development of the sensor. The Phase II work will focus on integration of this sensor into a modified Bridgman system, development of the control algorithm, and growth of semiconductor crystals in the developed system.",

Heart transplants are effective but scarce; medicines are available but - eventually - ineffective. A conceptually attractive answer, mechanical device 'destination therapy', is critically limited by power sources: present ones simply aren't compatible with safety in people restored to mobile, fully active lives - a clear goal of these devices. In turn, a conceptually attractive answer to this power problem, skeletal muscle harnessing, is critically limited by failure of force- transferring muscle-to-prosthesis interfaces.  We've solved this. The MyoCouplerTM uses a myriad of extremely fine polymer fibers, dispersed very distally in the muscle, reducing interface stress from > 10,000 mmHg (conventional sutures and clamps) to the existing interstitial muscle pressure.   Phase I proved feasibility; an independent group reproduced results in a different animal model. Further, our Phase II contracting research partner developed a hydraulic transfer system that is - except for this failing-interface dilemma - efficient, effective, and reliable.   Specific aims are: 1) designing and documenting a device complying with regulatory standards, 2) systematically testing it, and 3) demonstrating long-term reliability of cyclic energy transfer using a validated in vivo model. Results will enable the next commercialization step - a GLP animal study. Truly self-contained mechanical support will then be realistic.",

The overall objective of ADEPT development is to enhance patient care in Special Care Units (SCUs) through the further development and testing of a computerized, self-directed, training toot for Nurse Aides (NAs) which enhances their capacity to provide high quality support to patients in the core ADLs of bathing, dressing, and eating.  The underlying philosophy for ADEPT development is to apply the principles and methods of human factors engineering (HFE) to the improvement of care for patients with dementia.  The major HFE method to be implemented is task analysis to model patient activities in each ADL, and to identify the requirements associated with successful performance of each task.  ADEPT allows caregivers to identify those task performance elements that require assistance and provides recommendations for appropriate intervention strategies.  This approach enhances the independence of elders, fostering their ability to maintain/retain functioning to the maximum level at which they are capable or motivated to achieve.  Furthermore, the tool provides the health care industry with a method for appropriately training staff to match the capabilities and limitations of the elderly with appropriate care provided by Nurse Aides.  The Phase I ADEPT project resulted in the development of a prototype tool that incorporated the dressing ADL.  ADEPT-It will build on this by improving the prototype toot, increasing it's usability and interactivity by subjecting the tool to usability testing with prospective users, and extending its application by incorporating the eating and bathing ADLs.  ADEPT-Il will also incorporate an assessment module to rate appropriateness of NA assistive intervention choices during training.",

The algorithm utilized in our code can very effectively refine the mesh in regions of interest by moving nodes in regions of unchanging flow field for accurate prediction of steady and unsteady pressure and thermal load distributions. Our flow solver interacts with most popular commercial CAD packages through the CGNS interface and currently interfaces with OPTIMESH/MOM3D through a user friendly GUI provided with ICEM CFD mesh generator package. Benchmarks have been performed; among them is the moving-lid (lid-driven) cavity problem. This problem is a well-known standard to test CFD codes. The results of these benchmarks have been excellent.Further correlation and more stringent benchmarking will continue as part of the Phase II efforts. Enhancement of the code is required to accept additional mesh element types, for unsteady flows, inclusion of species, reaction and other scalar functions.Our objective for Phase II is to develop a product involving both the CFD solver and the grid adaptation module within a single package.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65020      Although, there is an abundant supply of methane in natural gas, the costs of transporting it are very high; therefore converting the gas into a highly desirable value added product would result in enormous benefits.  Because methane is a very stable molecule, this project will utilize a catalytic approach for its conversion into a high-tech material, graphite nanofibers.  These solids would be suitable for use in a variety of applications, including electronic materials as well as energy storage and generation devices.  Phase I demonstrated that high conversions of methane could be achieved by catalytic partial oxidation into a mixture of CO and H2 and that the decomposition of equivalent CO/H2 mixtures could generate highly crystalline nanotubular structures.  A preliminary economic evaluation of the process indicated that these materials can be produced at relatively low cost.  In Phase II, the two processes, partial oxidation and carbon nanostructure synthesis, will be integrated, and the effect of impurities present in both natural gas and the purification processes will be evaluated.  Finally, in collaboration with industrial partners, a pilot plant for the large-scale production of carbon nanostructures from natural gas will be constructed.            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Carbon nanostructures should have applications ranging from anti-static shielding to advanced energy.  The high production costs, which have hampered commercial implementation in the past, could be overcome by the use of natural gas as the source of solid carbon.  A further advantage is that the hydrogen, which is formed in the process, could be used as an energy source for electricity generation using fuel cells.",

One proposed hybrid transducerdesign incorporates laminated Terfenol-D materials for themagnetostrictive drive element.  However, the laminating approachlimits the design scope of the transducer device due to eddycurrent losses that reduce the efficiency as the frequencyincreases.  During the last decade, research focused ondeveloping magnetostrictive particulate composites to overcomethese and other issues.During the Phase I, Fortis Technologies increased the state ofthe art for magnetostrictive particulate composites by 1)developing a new manufacturing process, 2) increasing strainoutput, and 3) increasing piezomagnetic coefficients.   While thePhase I effort has been highly successful, a Phase II effortfocused on manufacturing and testing sonar-compatible CAMPdevices should be initiated to continue the progress leading thisnovel material to be introduced into an advanced sonar system,possibly a hybrid sonar device, which can be used in the US Navyarsenal in the upcoming decade.  This effort will include thedevelopment of a facility to fabricate large arrays ofmagnetostrictive particulate composite sonar transducers.BENEFITS: Fortis Technology is continually learning the unique benefits of this novel material.  The Phase II research will further develop the manufacturing",

They will be suitable for marine environments, and willbe based on the CMI proprietary periodic cellular metals conceptsidentified in an ONR SBIR Phase I program.In the Phase I program, CMI showed that structural panels, basedon a woven metal textile or formed metal truss cores, bonded tometallic face sheets were feasible for energy absorbingstructures and suitable for marine military vehicle applications.These materials are 75 to 95% less dense than conventional(solid) structural panels of comparable thickness.  Following thePhase I program, CMI proposes to further develop these cellularmetals concepts and to extend manufacturing routes to enablelarge scale production during Phase II.

Respiratory anthrax infections are almost invariably fatal despite antibiotic treatment. Existing vaccines provide no protection against certain strains of B. anthracis. A small drug-like molecule that could inhibit the action of lethal factor, the zinc metalloprotease responsible for the lethal effects of bacillus anthracis, could provide significant protection against anthrax. Using patented and proprietary protein structure-based methods, Structural Bioinformatics Inc. extracted 3D-pharmacophore information from the computationally modeled LF substrate MAPKK1 during Phase I. After synthesis based on this pharmacophore, seven compounds with 1C50 <50 mu M were obtained, including one with 1C50 = 2.7 mu M. The goal of Phase Il is to identify noncytotoxic LF inhibitors that inhibit the ability of anthrax dual toxin (LF + anthrax protective antigen) to kill monocytic cells, with IC50 < 100 nM, and >100-fold selectivity against LF versus human metalloenzymes. To this end, refined pharmacophores and docking models will be developed by applying SBl's technology to crystal structures data for LF and LF/inhibitor complexes. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a clinically useful small molecule that blocks the toxic effects of bacillus anthracis.",

The nanophase powder contained therein was consolidated to full theoretical density within20 seconds.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and back-scatter electron imaging (BEI) of the rapidly consolidated powder confirmed preservation of a nanophase microstructure consisting of 300 nanometer (nm) size grains.  It is believed that the dynamic shear stressintroduced by the quasi-isostatic pressure field destroyed tenacious powder particle surface oxides thereby enabling clean metal surfaces to metallurgically bond.  This enabled fabrication of a high quality, ductile nanophase products void of indigenous,property compromising defects common to aluminum metal powders.

While small research crystals can be obtained routinely by cooling a lead-based flux, large crystals suitable for incorporation into PET instruments are not readily grown. However, by introducing a proprietary, environmentally benign solvent developed to replace the lead-based flux, we believe high temperature solution (HTS) growth or top seeded solution growth (TSSG) could be the key to commercial production of large Ce:LOP crystals. The temperature and composition range for phase stability of Ce:LOP was investigated as part of the Phase I research program in order to define a robust production technology. Since the new solvent system can be applied to the growth of all REOP crystals, some of which have application as ultraviolet, visible, and infrared lasers, a commercial source of REOP crystals could ultimately lead to other new or improved medical instruments. The partial phase diagram derived from the temperature/composition study shows that Ce:LOP can be grown over a wide temperature range. The identified solvent demonstrates a high solubility with a temperature-dependent solubility gradient that will support HTS and/or TSSG.",

This project addresses this limitation by modifying the electrode composition to significantly reduce the driving force for the chemical reaction between the electrolyte and the electrodes during cell fabrication.  In Phase I, the compositions of the electrodes were modified to achieve both chemical and physical compatibility of the electrodes with the electrolyte under cell fabrication conditions.  In Phase II, processing parameters will be established to fabricate high performance gallate stacks using the electrodes developed in Phase I.  Stack performance will be characterized at 650 - 700C using natural gas fuel.

However, in order to  decrease domestic dependence on imported petroleum and to increase utilization of the domestic natural gas supply, there is considerable incentive for the selective production of basic chemicals from natural gas.  This project will develop a process for the selective conversion of methane to alkynes or dienes, through a novel intermediate, for use as chemical and petrochemical feedstocks.  The technical and economic feasibility of the proposed CH4 conversion process was evaluated during Phase I activities by using a combination of methods.  Detailed thermodynamic equilibrium calculations identified viable experimental conditions; experimental data identified potentially optimal intermediates and temperatures of operation; and a preliminary process engineering and economic model identified important process variables.  Significant reductions in energy consumption and waste generation per unit production of acetylene were indicated (compared to existing technologies).   Phase II will optimize the experimental conditions and reactor configuration for CH4 conversion to acetylene.  Technical issues related to reactor and process development will be addressed.

        "abstract": "Abstract         65531       Catalytic gasification of coal, when coupled with newly developed molten carbonate fuel cell technology, can provide electrical power generation with very high efficiency and extremely low emissions levels.  However, the commercialization of catalytic coal gasification will require the development of new catalysts, as existing catalysts are impractical for use and present many operational drawbacks.  The new catalysts must be reusable with longer lifetime, higher activity, and poisoning resistance.  This project will develop novel supported catalysts for coal gasification that exhibit high gasification activity at low reaction temperatures, resistance to deactivation by SO2 and other minerals, and long lifetimes.  In Phase I, the technical feasibility of synthesizing nano-structured supported catalysts was demonstrated, as was the short-term gasification activity of the catalysts in a bench-scale fixed bed reactor.  In Phase II, further catalyst development work will be undertaken to reduce the cost of the catalyst and to optimize its physical and chemical properties.  The catalysts activity and stability properties will be demonstrated using thermogravimetric studies, fixed bed reactor tests, and larger-scale experiments in a fluid-bed gasifier.  Forming procedures will be developed to adapt the catalyst physical structure to the requirements of fluidized bed gasifiers.  The expected costs associated with use of the catalyst for gasification will be estimated based on the gasifier test data, and will be compared with analogous costs for non-catalytic gasification.               Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Improved catalysts for coal gasification would enable the practical development of the gasification/fuel cell technology that could provide electrical power at very high efficiency, with competitive cost, and with extremely low pollutant levels.  Catalytic coal gasification should also be competitive for the production of syngas in the manufacture of synthetic fuels, reducing dependence on imported petroleum.",

The technology in this program, represents a new process for the manufacturing of cadmium Telluride (CdTe) solar cells. In this process the contact layers of copper-doped tellurium nanoparticles are sprayed on rather than sputtered, which promises to be a more efficient method of manufacturing. The successful CdTe solar cell prototype will be designed with input from potential end-users as a means of increasing the likelihood for commercialization. It is anticipated that this process will result in solar cells with superior initial and long-term efficiencies. Such improvements in performance could result in reduced costs for solar cell manufacturing ($/W), higher power during operation (kW-h/yr), and an extension of the useful lifetime - three aspects that will allow solar energy to be more competitive with existing methods for electric power production",

In Phase I, CFDRC enhanced and validated its 3D device simulator for RHBD. Various CMOS structures were analyzedfor their tolerance to single-event latchup (SEL) on the basis of MRC experimental results. This sets a good foundation for Phase II, where the RHBD software will be enhanced with TID phenomena.

There is also a very high degree of dependence of drug delivery on the combination of drug/spacer/patient factors. Detailed understanding drug delivery. The overall goal of the proposed study is to design, fabricate and test an improved pediatric spacer with optimal drug delivery patterns. During Phase I a sophisticated CFD analysis was used in combination with in-vitro experiments to identify specific design characteristics favorable/(un) favorable for overall drug delivery. Based upon the simulations a novel spacer was designed which used purely geometrical changes that (a) reduced drug deposition in spacer (b) increased emitted drug in the respirable range (c) lowered velocity of the emitted drug. The improved performance was confirmed through in-vitro experimental comparisons between the prototype spacer and several commercial spacers. In Phase II, the CFDRC spacer design will be further optimized using more advanced computational techniques, followed by manufacture of prototypes for more sophisticated and rigorous bench-top testing, clinical tests of the fully optimized spacer, and preparation for Phase Ill commercialization.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The improved design(s) developed in this study will have a direct impact on the 40-50 million asthma/allergy patients in the U.S. alone.

The majority of HRV serotypes bind ICAM-1 on nasal epithelial cells as the initial step in the infectious cycle: therefore preventing HRV from binding to ICAM-1 should prevent HRV attachment and thereby either prevent or shorten the duration and decrease symptoms of existing colds. A human clinical trial using intranasal administration of an anti-ICAM whole antibody delayed the onset of colds by up to 2 days and decreased symptoms 50% but failed to prevent initial infection, It is now known that the antibody CAM-1 dissociation rate is similar to that of the HRV virion itself indicating that the antibody has no innate advantage in functional affinity over the virus in occupying available receptors. We have generated a tetravalent humanized antibody against ICAM-1 for the prevention and treatment of human rhinovirus (HRV) infections. This protein shows significant functional improvement over the monodonal antibody and it can be produced in bacteria at much lower cost. The goals of the proposed phase II study is to fully characterize the biological, physical and chemical properties of the tetravalent anti-ICAM antibody, optimize the production process, establish quality control assays and to optimize the nasal spray formulation. Result from these studies will support filing of IND to obtain approval from FDA for clinical trials.",

Our model generationalgorithm is suited for both single-camera and stereo setups, enabling 3-D sensing of the environment all around the robot using only a few low-cost cameras. For example, a SESAME equipped robot can quickly build a low-resolution 3-D model of a row ofcars, automatically detecting occupied spaces, then approach a specific car and build a high-resolution model from a few stereo snapshots. This can be used onboard to determine the type of car and locate its license plate, or the high-resolution model canbe segmented out and sent back to an operator who can view it from a person-height viewpoint rather than robot height. As new views of the scene are obtained, the model is updated and changes are tracked (such as cars arriving or departing). Since therobot's position must be accurately known, we also present techniques for determining the position and orientation of the camera with respect to existing maps. We will deliver SESAME as an integrated system capable of near-real-time operation.\"",

Each network was constructed to assess a specific high-level situation in the form of the commander's priority intelligence requirement (PIR).

Sensors such as AFRL's new Micro-Laser Interferometer Doppler (MLID) measure minute vibrations on the surface of an object from alarge standoff distance. As we demonstrated in Phase I, a baseline ATR designed for vibrometry data can reliably recognize military vehicles when trained and tested on similar operating conditions. However, since no fielded vibrometry ATR systems exist,performance on extended operating conditions (EOCs, conditions unlike those used for training) is unknown. Charles River Analytics proposes a Phase II effort to provide the foundation for MLID-based ATR with consistent high performance across a range ofEOCs. To accomplish this goal, we will specify operating conditions which maximize the expected ATR performance improvement when vibrometry data collected for those operating conditions is added to the ATR's training set. We will use such data (collectedby AFRL) to improve our baseline ATR design and optimize its performance for the widest possible set of EOCs. For future research in this highly promising field, we will also develop a software toolset with an integrated graphical user interface andback-end database support for vibrometry ATR design and evaluation.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The heterogeneous, distributive, and voluminous nature of NASAs Earth science data archives impose severe constraints on meeting the diverse requirements of thousands of users who analyze the data. Additionally, communication bandwidth limitations, time constraints, and a multiplicity of archives impose further restrictions on users and systems. What is required is a reliable, robust and efficient technique that can be integrated within NASAs existing data servers for enhancing query support to archive users. We propose to design and prototype an Agent-based Complex QUerying and Information Retrieval Engine (ACQUIRE) for heterogeneous and distributed Earth science data sources over the Internet, while maintaining the autonomy of individual data sources. ACQUIRE translates a user query to a set of sub-queries by deploying a combination of planning and traditional database query optimization techniques. ACQUIRE first spawns a set of intelligent autonomous mobile search agents corresponding to these sub-queries for retrieving data from several Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) (e.g., such as the Alaska SAR Facility (ASF)). The engine then filters and merges data from these agents and returns the answers to the query. The proposed approach will build on existing data servers and meta-database catalogs of NASAs Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In the transition from current Air Traffic Management (ATM) practices to the envisioned Distributed Air-Ground Traffic Management (DAG-TM) environment, inter-aircraft negotiation protocols will prove to be a key driver in shaping the balance between traffic safety, flow rates, and individual carrier operating objectives. We propose to develop an agent-based simulation that will serve as a tool to explore these issues, by upgrading our existing in-house ATM simulation to include one or more state-of-the-art human decision-making models best suited for the ATM environment. We first propose to survey several modeling approaches that have potential in the ATM context, and then evaluate these models across a number of decision-making criteria, including: social welfare, individual rationality, stability, computational efficiency, scalability, and convergence. We will then implement one or more of the most promising decision-making models within an existing agent-based architecture, evaluate the representational fidelity of these agent-based models, and assess their utility in predicting the impact of different protocols on overall air traffic operations. We will also assess usability from the standpoint of the system designer in formulating effective negotiation guidelines for future ATM practices.",

Our objective in this effort is to develop a Testbed forAir-vehicle Coordination Techniques (TACT), to provide agent-based support for high-fidelity modeling, simulation, and analysis of UAV missions. In Phase I we demonstrated the general feasibility of the approach in the context of a UCAV SEAD scenario. Thedeveloped TACT prototype included capabilities for mission design through high-level interfaces, continuous tactical situation assessment through belief network technology, route-planning techniques that address uncertainty, and vehicle coordinationthrough a flexible communication framework.In Phase II, we propose to expand TACT's capability for supporting mission analysts in configuring and experimenting with a wide range of UAV missions. In particular, we propose to develop capabilities for the definition of flexible UAV model functionalityin terms of situation assessment techniques, plan options, coordination models, and autonomy degrees. We will also provide modeling capabilities for variable mission structures, and for the definition and use of various types of mission performancemetrics. The prototype will integrate and comply with existing US Air Force simulation environments and standards.\"",

A typical satellite control system uses 500 to 1000 commandlets (fragmentary commands), which must be optimally puttogether for efficient and effective satellite control.  Also, since satellites can be controlled from many different places, with learning and training also spread across the world, working in multiple task environments leads to increased workload, anddemands superior performance skills both in stressful and non-stressful situations.  With a systematic and logical approach, existing cognitive theories can be unified with advances in computer technology to develop scenario-based assessment andoptimization programs for satellite control. Cybernet will build upon our past success in individual training performance to create a new system that will allow the measurement of team performance.  Specifically, we will develop scenarios of satelliteoperation and control based on the combination of commandlets, and test operator cognitive workload by using a combination of primary measures, secondary-task techniques, physiological measures, and subjective tests. This system will provide not only forthe capability of advanced team training in complicated and stressful environments, but also the optimization of this training and creation of composite commands from commandlets.\"",

However, there is a difficulty with getting studnets to work together in specific areas in large numbers, as bringing them together is very prohibitive. To encourge students collaboratiton, Cybernet proposes to develop, deploy, and evaluate a virtual reality based modeling kit that will enable students to collaboratively build, co-habit, and present virtual models of the solar system within a web-based inquiry framwork. Cybernet, collaborating with top researchers at the University of Georgia, is uniquiely qualified to develop this system based on their years of experience with virtual reality, distance learning and human-computer interaction. We believe that this instructional approach and base technolgoy will open up an entirely new mode of instruciton that will be extendable to many other mathmatics, science, and technology domains.

The primary focus of this SBIR is to improve the operational availability (Ao) of the towed arrays currently in the US Navy's inventory.

The VITC integrates the functions of the Vibration Isolation Modules andthe tow cable to obtain a single assembly that serves both purposes. The benefits are improved vibration attenuation performance, lower system cost and higher reliability.  The Improved Array Coupler distributes the functions performed by the coupler andthus reduces the rigid body length of that critical component.  The benefits are improved array reliability and lower recurring cost.

In addition, the large number of SBIRS satellites means SBIRS crews willbe operating under significantly increased workload conditions relative to past satellite control operations.  To assist these personnel with crew coordination management, we are developing a training and performance support toolkit called the AdaptiveDecision Enabling and Performance Tracking Toolkit (ADEPTT).

By providing common look-and-feel and following explicit principles of interaction  across tasks andcomputing platforms, PCIs will seem familiar and intuitive, optimize CPR interaction, and require minimal learning, . Phase I also designed a software toolset  that uses the design framework and an underlying software reference architecture to support thecost-effective implementation and life-cycle maintenance of PCIs.   The toolset is called the Reference Architecture for Practitioner-centric Interface Deployment or RAPID. It will support PCI interface development for a range of hardware devices from PDAsand tablet computers to laptop and desktop machines. It will also support virtually any CPR database or repository, but the Phase II RAPID will focus on compatibility with the Army's developmental CHCS-II system.

These systems will provide basic and essential infrastructure for space-based cell biology research. However, full utilization of the Space Station biological research facilities will require additional instrumentation with specialized capabilities for quantitative cell analysis. The development of highly automated and miniaturized instrumentation and advanced methodologies has been singled out as a high research priority in Space Biology; the present proposal addresses this NASA need. A fundamental biological process in which gravity is known to play a role is gene expression. We propose development of a novel surface plasmon resonance imaging spectrometer system for label-free protein expression profiling in space. The system will consist of a rugged, compact instrument with low mass and low power consumption, and a proteomics biosensor chip array integrated into a microfluidics cartridge. The label-free nature of the system makes it ideally suited for space-based application as it will permit direct seamless coupling between cell culture samples and the biosensor to make it possible and convenient to perform complex cellular analyses in real time within the resource limitations and triple containment constraints extant in the Space Station.",

Sensor technologies capable of monitoring the expression of proteins on a large scale (proteomics) are needed to fully exploit the unique capabilities of RWVs. This Phase II effort is part of a program to develop an advanced analytical monitoring system for quantitative detection of bioreactor bioproducts in microgravity. The underlying technology is grating-coupled surface plasmon resonance, which permits sensitive, label-free, parallel detection of bioproducts in a complex fluid without purification steps in real time. The objective of this effort is to develop generic capture microarrays that will allow for the site-directed self-assembly of tailor-made, user-defined high-density multi-component assay chips. This is accomplished by immobilizing a library of short oligonucleotide PNA (peptide nucleic acid) probe molecules on a chip in a site-specific manner using covalent attachment chemistry and a spotting method. Capture molecules that will compose the array are tagged (off-line) with a library of complementary PNA sequences. Then, the microarray is assembled by flowing the complex mixture of different PNA-tagged compounds over the chip, which through hybridization reactions, form site-directed self-assembled arrays. A set of microarrays will be produced and a complementary set of protein-PNA conjugates relevant to microgravity research.",

Venous bags have been shown to be clinically safer than hard shall reservoirs yet there is no a soft shell venous reservoir combined with a cardiotomy reservoir (V/C) to form a single unit.

A need exists for patients to be able to have long term recordings of patient's ECG without burdening the patient with a large, pager-size device or to require the patient to take positive actions. This program will develop a miniature, multi-channel wireless physiological monitor transmitter that will monitor and instantaneously transmit ECG without any action by the patient. It will provide a link between the patient's heart and the physician's computer. The physician will be able to see the ECG of the patient at any time, whether the patient is in the hospital, at an extended care facility, or at home or work by using the local Ethernet within le hospital or telephone network when outside the hospital. It will also monitor the ECG on a personal digital assistant (PDA) and then synchronize the data to a personal computer for months or years if desired. This is particularly important for syncope monitoring. The patient need not push a button or telephone anyone; everything is done automatically. It will call 911 or other emergency numbers when physician programmed conditions are detected by the software, without any action by the patient.",

This device will allow behavior to be observed and physiological parameters to be measured without tethering the rodent as is traditionally required. \r \r The Phase I of this program developed a small, two channel wireless physiological monitor transmitter that allows EEG, EKG, EMG and other physiological parameters of rats and other small animals to be measured by researchers. The Phase I developed a transmitter, which is small enough to be worn by a rat, and demonstrated the feasibility of such a device. It contains a data acquisition section, a digital section, and a programmable RF transmitter section. It is packaged in a silicone dip, which will protect the device from urine and other fluids as well as from electric shock. It has been tested on rats at John Hopkins Medical Institutions. \r \r In Phase II, the transmitter will be shrunk to allow it to be used for developing rats or mice environments. The transmitter will have sufficient range to allow the animals to freely move about their environment, which will allow for free maze studies, and even mazes that include navigating through water. Testing on the RatPaak will be continued at Johns Hopkins during the Phase II as well as testing on the newly developed MousePaak.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The expanding field of molecular genetics has quickly outpaced the knowledge of medical providers, due in part to the Human Genome Project. The genetics of brain illnesses are only beginning to be understood, nevertheless, providers treating patients with mental health, substance abuse and neurological disorders need to understand clearly what is and is not known about genetics and brain illnesses. It is likely that genetic aspects of schizophrenia, autism, mental retardation, bipolar disorder, among others, will be further identified in the near future, creating confusion and difficult choices for patients and families. Current and future providers must be prepared to explain and understand genetic susceptibility as it applies to a full range of illnesses. In Phase I, we will develop and evaluate an Internet-based CE program focusing on genetic issues related to alcoholism. We will also use the course the discuss upcoming technologies as well as issues related to discussing genetic risk with a patient. Phase II will produce 7 additional course on a variety of topic related to illnesses of the brain including Mixed Substance Abuse, Alzheimer's Disease, Schizophrenia, Affective Disorders, Attention Deficit, Huntington's Disease, and Mental Retardation. For each course we will highlight: 1) how genetic knowledge may affect patients and be used in clinical practice; 2) communication of genetic knowledge with patients and families: preparing for patients' questions; 3) where relevant, ethical, legal and psychosocial issues related to genetic testing, and 4) understanding emerging technologies and findings in genetics. A multidisciplinary team including representatives from psychiatry, genetics, genetic counseling, and primary care will create the content. We will evaluate the courses' effect on knowledge, clinical skills and self-efficacy using simple randomized studies comparing subjects using the genetics course to subjects using an online CE course on another topic. If successful, the training will expand the capabilities of the existing pool of providers and improve the training of future providers regarding the role of genetics in illnesses of the brain. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Physicians are required to obtain CME credit to maintain licensure and privileges. Managed care organizations (MCOs), such as large HMOs, may be interested in purchasing access to CE that can be offered to participant professionals. Pharmaceutical companies may also want to support development of courses based on the model described in this application.",

Protocols for childhood leukemia involve multiple cycles of chemotherapy that can be administered at home. However, the proper administration of these potentially life-saving medications in the home is a safety issue. Pediatric Cancer CareLink will support the care of these children by helping their parents manage medications, side effects of treatment, and potential complications. Pediatric Cancer CareLink will provide families with a direct link to the oncology team responsible for their child's care. In our Phase I research we identifed clinician and patient requirements for Pediatric Cancer CareLink. We determined that families and clinicans would be likely to use the Internet-based support system and that they believed the system would provide benefits and advantages compared with not having the system available. In Phase II our primary objectives will be to evaluate whether parents with access to Pediatric Cancer CareLink are more comfortable with managing their child's medications and medication side effects at home, and whether they report a higher level of satisfaction with the overall outpatient care that their child receives, than are parents without access to CareLink. We will also evaluate whether patients with access to Cancer CareLink report less at home medication errors or missed medication doses, than do patients do not have access to CareLink. Twenty parent volunteers who do not have access to Pediatric Cancer CareLink will be asked to complete two questionnaires at 2 months and 6 months into their child's therapy. Results from these questionnaires will be compared with the same questionnaires from twenty parent volunteers at 2 months and 6 months into their child's therapy, who do have access to Pediatric Cancer CareLink. Pediatric Cancer CareLink will provide families a direct, secure Internet care support channel to their cancer care team. This innovative system will empower providers and families to improve care processes and outcomes for children with ALL. PediatricCancer CareLink will serve as a model for enhancing care processes and outcomes for patients and families dealing with other forms of cancer and with other treatment regimens.",

PCDB focuses on the field of protein catabolism, aberrations of which are implicated in cancer, neurodegeneration, inflammation, and immune disorders. During Phase I, a sophisticated classification system of proteolysis factors and substrates was devised, and a relational data structure created, complete with data input and retrieval interfaces. In Phase II, PCDB will be populated with comprehensive information on proteolysis pathways, and advanced interfaces for data mining and visualization will be created. The ultimate goal of PCDB is to provide academic and industrial investigators with carefully curated, up-to-date information on proteolysis, integrated with software tools to link specific knowledge to specific research problems. Completely unique applications will be developed, enabling targeting of pathogenic proteins through their proteolytic regulators, rational design of protein drugs with consideration of their in vivo half-lives. PCDB will also be novel in its ability to model drug effects on biological pathways, to differentiate complex biological states, and to accept user-generated curation. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The Protein Catabolism Database and its integrated software suite will have commercial application in industry and academia in the genome-wide prediction of proteolysis factors and substrates, tareting of proteins through proteolytic regulators, rational design of protein drugs with targeted in vivo half-lives, in silico modeling of pathogenic and drug-induced proteolytic pathways, and analysis of protein expression data elucidating pathogenesis and toxicology.",

This process requires the inclusion of all phenomena that significantly influence the data after propagation through the detection chain.

This Phase II proposal develops a generalized architecture, framework, and methodology, usingChemical and Biological (CB) detection as the example problem domain.  This proposal enhances the fidelity of the simulated data reported to decision support systems by improving and extending the simulation environment's support of atmospheric models,infrared standoff CB detector models, uncertainty measures, model performance metrics, and time-synchronization and nesting of simulations within an integrated software and hardware framework.  This framework provides distributed access to various forms ofdata and associated models.  Proposed enhancement options are: developing a novel scene generator that will generate realistic inputs to active standoff detectors and simulations; and developing a test system, based on the scene generator, to test andevaluate these detection systems.

In particular, we will investigate three primary issues in critical thinking training: the role of cognitive process models, the use of dialogue theory as a basis for training, and strategies to facilitatetransfer of training to new tasks or domains. Training will be developed that reflects specific hypotheses regarding these issues, and will be experimentally tested with active-duty officers at a variety of Army posts. A second objective of Phase II is todevelop a demonstration critical thinking training system that applies technology developed in previous work. The system will illustrate the delivery of feedback and coaching for critical thinking in the form of challenge-and-response dialogues.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are associated with, and may be predictors of diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and cancer. In Phase I, we discovered novel and selective substrates for the MMP collagenase 3, an enzyme implicated in OA and cancer progression. Substrates were obtained by modifying sequence data gained from substrate mapping on protein expression libraries in phage lambda (phage display). We will extend this study to include other MMPs that are potential disease markers for not only OA and cancer, but also RA, so that we may obtain a profile of activities for a specific disease state. Phage display results are reported for stromelysin 1, gelatinase A and gelatinase B while a synthetic peptide library was used to determine the substrate specificity of collagenase 1. One goal is to use this knowledge to develop an \"assay\" kit that can measure these MMP activities directly in biological fluids. We will develop this kit by using two approaches: fluorescence substrates that are selective for the above MMPs, and neo-epitope antibodies to the protein fragments generated by collagenase 3 and/or gelatinase B cleavages. This \"assay\" kit can then be used in arthritis and cancer by assessing disease progression.",

HF mirror metrology is currently costly and time consuming, requiring laser component deliveryto an HF laser site, and operation of another HF laser to reach relevant wavelengths.  Coherent Technologies, Inc (CTI) proposes a portable, turn-key all-solid-state metrology system based on a laser providing over 1W narrow linewidth output, tunable tomajor HF laser lines (2.64 - 2.91 mm).  A direct laser source is chosen instead of a nonlinear optical device because of the superior intensity stability and simplicity, creating a more robust and accurate metrology system. The system will be portable,enabling transportation to coating vendors for immediate turn-around testing of mirror characteristics (reflectivity and scattering) at a range of HF laser lines.  Other possible applications include beam train alignment and preliminary testing ofdiagnostic subsystems that measure HF laser output power, wavefronts, and beam profiles.  In Phase II, CTI will construct a complete metrology system, conduct metrology tests at CTI, and install the system at an Air Force specified site.  The proposed workbuilds upon CTI?s established background in tunable mid-IR lasers and ruggedized frequency-stable laser systems\"",

Optical fibers are compact and can efficiently amplify high data rate diode lasers, but do not provide the peak power required for detection over deep space transmit distances. Bulk diode-pumped solid-state lasers can produce the required Q-switched pulse energies, but are not as efficient or robust as guided-wave lasers. Furthermore, bulk lasers require a high voltage Q-switch to accurately time the laser pulses for pulse-position modulation (PPM) formats. Coherent Technologies, Inc. has recently discovered a new waveguide laser geometry that allows TEM00 operation in a multi-transverse mode waveguide capable of high power operation. This geometry is exceptionally compact/lightweight and capable of high conversion efficiency as is typically achieved in fiber lasers. Furthermore, this same technology can be applied to create low voltage ( 15 V) Q-switches or phase modulators resulting in a nearly monolithic optical communications transmitter. The waveguide laser transmitter is compatible with a variety of data encoding formats, could be used with direct or coherent detection receivers, and will be capable of data rates in excess of 10 Mbps.",

Currently available sensors do not provide the ability to sample a large volume of atmosphere with accuracy and precision, limiting the ability to compare measurements with global and local exchange models.  This project will build an eye-safe, coherent, laser-radar-based, CO2 remote sensor that is fieldable and capable of measuring CO2 concentrations precisely and accurately over several kilometers.  Increasing the interrogation area will permit the monitoring of large scale carbon dynamics, which is crucial to understanding the carbon cycle.  In Phase I, detailed modeling calculations were performed to predict the performance of low and high power, pulsed and continuous wave, CO2 sensors.  The calculations indicated that precise and accurate (<1ppm) CO2 measurements could be achieved with heterodyne detection laser-based sensors over ranges of several kilometers.  In addition, experiments were performed to measure CO2 column content over a range exceeding 600 meters with a heterodyne detection receiver.   In Phase II, a compact, solid-state laser-radar-based sensor, that will measure CO2 remotely in the atmosphere over several kilometers, will be built.  Measurements with this field-ready system will be performed to compare this sensor with the point sensors and short path devices already in service.

Diode-pumped Erbium-doped direct 1.5-micron lasers offer the greatest opportunityfor high efficiency and low cost transmitters. However, bulk and micro-chip Erbium lasers require high Er concentrations which results in poor conversion efficiency due to up-conversion effects. Er fiber lasers have demonstrated high efficiency, but do notscale to the required pulse energies. CTI proposes a new Er-doped waveguide laser concept that has been previously demonstrated at CTI and that combines the benefits of fiber lasers with the power scaling capability of bulk lasers. The transmitter will (1)use one or two high efficiency, long-lifetime, single-emiter diode lasers that do not require active temperature control, (2) produce a substantially lower heat load than flashlamp-pumped lasers, (3) have high efficiency for longer battery lifetime, (4) iscapable of 10 mJ output energy in a TEM00 beam and sub-10 ns pulse width, and (5) has a final cost estimate of less than $1000/transmitter. CTI's proven ability to design and engineer rugged and compact laser ranging systems for demanding environments willensure a successful hardware development program.\"",

The variable resolution (pulsewidth) of this sensor provides flexibility between resolution and update time, which scales with the inverse of the cube of the pulse width.  High-speed, wide-angle, detection utilizing a long pulse width and an increase in spectral width provides cues topotential target locations.  High resolution positive ID is accomplished using a short pulse width.  In the long-pulse (350 ns) mode, the scan rate will exceed 5 degrees/sec (e.g., 45 degrees in 9 sec) , while providing 5 m cross range resolution at 5 km.In the high-resolution mode (55 ns ~ 8 m) update rates less than 1.7 seconds per LOS are expected.  In both modes, a velocity precision better than 20 cm/s at ranges in excess of 5 km is achieved.  The sensor is designed to produce arbitrary pulse widths,between these two bounds, to facilitate custom signature detection.  The base Phase II effort focuses on the development and demonstration of the novel brassboard sensor and refined clutter rejection algorithms.

Sensors are needed to provide search, detect, track and identification functions.  Differential absorptionlidar (DIAL) has been demonstrated as one of the most promising techniques for standoff identification of chemical agents.  However, to date, these sensors utilize CO2 laser transmitters which are large, cumbersome, not highly robust, have difficultyaccessing certain critical wavelengths, output nonideal pulse formats and have significant prime power requirements.  The proposed work will develop an innovative optical parametric oscillator (OPO) based laser transmitter capable of replacing these CO2lasers.  The end goal is a DIAL sensor suitable for use in civilian, military installation and battlefield settings; man and UAV portable; efficient enough to run off battery power; and capable of providing chemical identification functions with minimalfalse alarm rates and no false negatives.  Advantages of the proposed transmitter over competing solid-state laser technologies include (1) an innovative, power-scalable, mass-manufacturable, patent-pending drive laser technology, (2) afrequency-conversion architecture enabling very high optical efficiency, (3) an electronic tuning scheme that provides rapid OPO wavelength selection and (4) a patent-pending bandwidth selection technique enabling",

A significant barrier to using composites in these applications involves processing limitations with respect to part size and volume. Processing routes utilizing chemical vapor deposition/infiltration (CVD/CVI) require high-temperature pressure reactors and rely on time/temperature dependent diffusion. As a result, CVD/CVI facility reactor dimensions limits the maximum part size while process physics limit the practical thickness/volume of parts to be infiltrated. Polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) processing may overcome such limitations. Although significant development has been done in the PIP processing of SiC/SiC systems, little work has been done with PIP C/SiC CMCs. Insufficient data and material properties exist for PIP processed thick cross section parts, which has hindered acceptance and application of this process. The work proposed here provides a baseline mechanical property database for PIP processed C-SiC CMCs, and provides the initial evaluation of thick section composites processed using the PIP approach and incorporating the latest advancements in process cost and schedule reductions.",

The proposed innovation is a boom design that can be highly optimized so as to reduce redundant structural mass. The boom can be tailored along its length so that its failure load is a prescribed amount above actual load. Optimization of solar sail booms may result in significant mass reductions, which could in turn boost the mass budget of the ultra-thin sail films. This could in turn cause significant cost savings and risk reduction due to the fact that more material can be applied to the sail to make it more robust. Phase I will focus on mass and load study, sail and boom interface issues, and stowing configurations. In addition, a small proof-of-concept sample will be fabricated tested.

The unique innovation of the DSC is to take advantage of the changes in apparent solar width, and use a concentrator with limited acceptance angle to reduce the light transmitted to the solar cell at near-sun conditions, when the apparent solar disk angle and collimation angle is large, and transmit more solar energy to the solar cell when at far-sun conditions, when the apparent solar disk size and collimation angle is small. In the Phase I SBIR, we demonstrated the basic operation of the Deep Space Concentrator through optical and thermal analysis and the fabrication and test of a Demo Model.

NASA has identified CMCs as the only materials that will meet the combination of increased safety, reduced cost, and reduced weight as operational temperatures climb to higher levels (per AeroMat 2000 Annual Conference, June 2000). The current UEET (Ultra Efficient Engine Technology) initiative at NASA is looking at components such as combustor liners and vanes in particular. In light of these needs, this Phase II SBIR proposal addresses lightweight, high temperature, and low cost CMCs for engine and propulsion applications, particularly in the temperature range of 1200-1400C. The work specifically addresses the optimization of a hybrid PIP/MI SiC fiber-reinforced SiC-matrix composite (SiC/SiC). Effort will focus on using SiNC- and SiC-yielding preceramic polymers and a combination of PIP and melt-infiltration processing routes that will reduce the cost and time for producing SiC/SiC composites compared to traditional CVI/MI processing. The intent of this work is to refine and optimize the PIP/MI process developed in Phase I, generate a database of thermal and mechanical properties, and demonstrate fabrication capability of subcomponents. The innovation of this work lies in the ability of PIP processing to protect the fibers and interphase coating in a uniform manner compared to the CVI process, resulting in faster and less expensive processing as well as less variability in material properties.",

The resulting technology could find application by military and commercial entities for training, virtual prototyping, and simulation-based design and robotics.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"Certification tests for aircraft structures are necessary to ensure the load carrying capability and performance of each component. However, hardware testing is costly and delays the design cycle. In current certification procedures, a limited number oftests are performed, especially at full-scale, and the stochastic nature of structural failures is not captured.  The solution is to augment experimental testing with analysis with the goal of increasing structural reliability.  This process is called\"certification-by-analysis.\"  In the proposed research, Collier Research will work with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics to develop a certification by analysis process through several efforts.  First, LM will apply the commercial structural sizing software,HyperSizerr, to several programs including STRICT unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) development and sustainment programs for the C-130J, C-140 and C-5 transports.  Second, data will be collected from recent structural test programs and correlated to analysispredictions.  Probabilistic methods using this data will be incorporated into the certification by analysis process.  Finally, a \"design-by-analysis\" process will be implemented for providing certified robust designs.  The developed process will beapplicable to UAVs, Space Access and Future Strike Vehicles, and sustainment of existing military aircraft.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  One key to more effective vaccines is better delivery of antigen to rare antigen-presenting cells, known as dendritic cells.  Current efforts to deliver vaccines to dendritic cells entail: a) individualized ex vivo procedures that are costly, or b) adjuvants that activate innate immunity with inflammation that could result in unacceptable toxicity.  Our goal is to develop a simple, safe and inexpensive, topical vaccine delivery system that targets dendritic cell precursors in the epidermis called Langerhans cells.  Lancell's approach is to deliver antigen to large numbers of Langerhans cells and induce them to migrate to draining lymph nodes where they can activate naive T cells.  In Phase I, we developed a quantitative assay that is sensitive and directly measures immunogenic peptides associated with Langerhans cells after their migration to skin draining lymph nodes.  The proposed Phase II studies will optimize each parameter of our vaccine delivery system for the induction of tumor immunity in a murine model system.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Nearly 1.5 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. annually, and virtually all of these patients are candidates for an effective tumor immunotherapy.  Tumor-associated antigens continue to be identified, but there is a need for more immunogenic vaccines.  Lancell, L.L.C. is developing a vaccine delivery system exploiting epidermal Langerhans cells that is designed to be simple, potent and cost-effective.",

Intense turbulence is encountered along the beam propagation path in the aircraft nearfield, e.g.boundary layer, free shear layer, or wake. Flowfield turbulence creates a highly non-uniform and time-varying, three-dimensional, fluctuating density field, causing a propagating optical wavefront to incur phase delays and become aberrated. Aero-opticalwave-front errors produce beam spreading in high-energy laser weapon beams, which drastically reduces target irradiance and lethality for DE weapons and impairs laser-guided bomb accuracy. Optical degradation, and compensation by adaptive optics, iscompounded by the broad spectrum of turbulence frequencies, which can exceed 10 kHz for typical fighter flowfields. The Phase II program will provide sub-scale demonstration of beam performance improvement by implementing high-frequency flow control, usingnovel actuators. High-resolution numerical simulations and novel optical diagnostics will provide insight into the physics underlying beam attenuation and remediation. Scaling laws will be developed and flow control effectiveness demonstrated.

The formulation is based on a compressible gas-liquid framework that accurately models the acoustics in a multi-phase mixture. This methodology was successfully applied, in our Phase I effort, to simulate cavitating inducer performance in water. Our Phase II effort will extend this formulation to cavitation in cryogenic fluids which exhibit, relative to water, far more complex physics; cryogenic pumps operate at temperatures closer to the critical temperature of the working fluid making thermodynamic effects important. The model will account for the variation in the properties of the fluid as a function of the local fluid temperature that may vary due to energy requirements of vaporization/condensation. It will be incorporated within the commercially marketed code CRUNCH CFD that has a multi-element unstructured framework and is ideally suited for complex turbomachine configurations. This framework will be used as a design support tool to analyze inducer designs and in particular determine the suction specific speed at which head breakdown occurs. The limited reliability of current design tools in cavitating flow regimes makes this innovation a useful tool for turbomachine designers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65569   The use of poultry waste for power generation often involves transporting the poultry waste to centralized power stations and pelletizing facilities.  However, siting, financial, and feedstock supply issues have led to pending legislation to control the disposal of the waste, which could have significant financial impact on the poultry industry, especially on small and medium growers that comprise the majority of operations.  Small, modular biopower units that convert poultry waste to heat and power at small and medium size operations would address this situation, but such technology does not exist in the U.S..  This project will develop small modular biopower options so that poultry waste can be used to generate electricity and heat for on-site applications.  In Phase I, analyses of poultry waste were conducted, its fuel properties were characterized, and its ash was evaluated as a source of fertilizer.  The poultry waste was successfully converted to utility-grade AC power, and commercial options were identified for local biopower solutions to the poultry waste problem.  Phase II will perform sub-scale tests of alternative small biopower generation technologies.  Then, an on-farm modular biopower system will be designed and constructed, and field trials will be conducted.            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Local, distributed power solutions to the poultry waste problem should resolve siting, economic, feedstock transportation, and supply issues raised by large central power plants.  With a conservative 20% market penetration in the U.S. market, sales of biopower equipment should exceed $500 million.  The value of the electricity, heat, and fertilizer would comprise an additional $90 million per year.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  COMPACT proposes research to utilize the Web to deliver a curriculum of highly accessible courses for improving the personal memory skills of able-minded older adults. Conventional classroom memory training is labor intensive, costly and not practical for elderly adults in rural areas or who have limited mobility. For over four years NIA has supported The ACTIVE (for Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly) Study to show that group-based cognitive intervention can help reduce disability, delay nursing home placement and improve quality of life in later adulthood. Alternative modes of cognitive intervention for the elderly are needed and can be as effective as in vivo group-based interventions like ACTIVE. The Web is a new mode of distance learning for older adults that promotes social interchange, via E-mail and online Chat, an important concomitant of late life learning and a deterrent to loneliness among the elderly.    This study examines the effectiveness of individualized Web memory training via MemoryUniversity.com.  As in ACTIVE, we will assess the effect of our cognitive intervention on \"proximal\" outcome measures directly related to memory performance in everyday life and \"distal\" measures more strongly associated with hospitalization and need for formal care. Phase II aims: 1) produce Web courses offering a curriculum focused on memory improvement, including background information, strategy training assessment, and practice components; 2) assess the acceptability and functionality of the Web site among older adults; 3) test the efficacy of the courses in changing older adults' knowledge, attitudes, and intended behaviors toward memory enhancement specifically, and quality of life more generally.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The On-Line Memory University memory skill training courses is for individuals via the Practical Memory Institute (PMI), and PMI mini-sites at membership organization web sites e.g., Novarti's HealthAndAge.com, AARP.org, SeniorNET.org, ThirdAge.com etc.; 2) to corporate and governmental organizations via license to Global Learning Systems, Inc.; 3) to online seniors at assisted living facilities (e.g., LinkAges.org & Sunrise Assisted Living); 4) to Professional memory trainers via APA's Div 20; and 5) rehabilitation professionals at the VA, Society of Cognitive Rehabilitation, American Speech Language Hearing Assn.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65445     Consumption of diesel fuel and gasoline have led to significant dependence on foreign fuel as well as increased carbon dioxide emissions with the associated concern for global warming.  Diesel engines are much more fuel efficient than spark/gasoline engines, but unfortunately diesel engines produce high NOx emissions.  This has been addressed by a process known as exhaust gas recycle (EGR), which lowers NOx emissions by 50%; however, it also reduces engine life and puts significant stress on the cooling system.  This project will utilize high productivity membranes in a combination with modest engine design changes to produce nitrogen-enriched air (cold/clean ERG) with overall NOx emissions reduced by 85% and little change in other emissions.  The productivity from these membranes is sufficiently high to allow systems to be placed under the hoods of trucks.  Using a single cylinder engine, Phase I demonstrated that the synergy of nitrogen enriching membranes and the unique combustion process can lead to 80-90% NOx reduction with no significant change in other emissions.  In parallel, a viable route to large-scale membrane manufacture was established.  Phase II will improve the membrane fabrication and engine design.  The combustion process will be assessed over the full engine map and validated as a system.            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The initial commercial focus will be for heavy duty diesel trucks that can meet the EPA regulation of 80-90% NOx reductions.  Passenger vehicles should be a second tier opportunity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Diesel generator sets (gen-sets) are used routinely to supply electrical power. Hospitals, businesses, and small communities use gen-sets to help reduce costs by load leveling and provide emergency power during blackouts (either scheduled or unscheduled). Recent power outages in California have led to large increases in the purchase of gen-sets, primarily for providing emergency power. In addition to providing value associated with load leveling and emergency power, gen-sets have an added value in that they can be installed relatively rapidly. Although gen-sets are, in principle, under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation, many of these gen-sets are being rapidly installed with minimal concern for EPA emissions and exclusively focus on providing back-up power to avoid blackouts. The net effect of these events should be an increase in air pollutants (mostly NOx) as these gen-sets are brought online.  In Phase I, Compact Membrane Systems, Inc. (CMS) met and exceeded all project goals. This included: (1) demonstration of 50 percent NOx reduction while having minimal effect on other pollutants, (2) fabrication of prototype membrane systems/devices for easy installation or retrofit into diesel generators, and (3) enhanced overall membrane/system performance to perform better even when only low turbo pressure is available. This success has led to the active participation in the project of a major industrial gas membrane company, a major diesel generator company, the U.S. Navy, and a major university. The participation of these groups will enhance Phase II and subsequent commercialization. In Phase II, CMS will design and build full-size retrofit kits and install them on intermediate-scale diesel generators (e.g., 1,500 kw). Working with their diesel generator partner, CMS will modify turbocharger operating conditions and engine operating conditions to reduce NOx emissions and have a minimal effect on particulate emissions. Working with their industrial gas partner, CMS will optimize membrane design to match engine needs. The company also will demonstrate performance over an extended period of time to show system ruggedness. CMS will perform an economic evaluation to demonstrate that the retrofit system is cost effective compared to alternative systems.",

Low cost pre-ceramic polymer CMC manufacturing methods combined with automated low-cost fiber preforming methods will be applied in order to keep both material and processing costs at a minimum. Mechanical test coupons will be fabricated and tested. Phase-II objectives would include design and fabrication of a sub-scale test component to verify durability of the composite structure along with manifolding and hermeticity of coolant channels.

During Phase I, CSC explored theapplicability of the CWT available using our analog spatio-temporal image filtering hardware and developed the necessary simulation capabilities to explore its utility and drive future hardware development. Our novel approach leverages the natural abilityof massively parallel analog circuitry to perform important computationally intensive image processing tasks in real-time, and therefore has potential for handling real-time identification of incoming targets. During this proof-of-concept phase, aspatio-temporal motion-energy analysis technique was developed and applied to scene sets for the discrimination of subtle differences between incoming target types.

In addition to performing the processstudy, COI applied its methodology to a dome that had failed inthe field and refurbished it. This dome was delivered as part ofthe Phase I effort. In Phase II we propose a program that has asits goal the refurbishment of existing non-operational F14  IRSTGermanium Domes. In addition to refurbishing the currentinventory as a consequence of this Phase II work, at the end ofthe program, COI will have all of the necessary hardware andexpertise to serve as a repair depot for any additional domesthat become damaged during service. In addition, the advancedcapabilities provided by the Phase II process will allow us totransition into Phase III by offering similar services to otheragencies.BENEFITS: Germanium domes are often used as a cover for aerodynamic pods.  Germanium is a good substrate to use as it has excellent transmission in the necessary waveband, however since they are the outer element in flight, they  are oftendamaged. The research in this proposal indicates a process where previously unusable domes can be repaired and put back into service by the US Navy.  There are numerous programs where these types of domes have been used.  Damaged domes could be repaired ata fraction of the cost sa",

Automating the thermo-mechanical analysis process is the proposed innovation. Integrating the new methodology within an existing multi-discplinary turbopump design system (owned by NASA and select turbopump manufacturers) is the primary commercialization path. The subtopic calls for advancements in the area of integrated multi-disciplinary design and analysis systems for important vehicle subsystems such as turbopumps. As detailed later in this proposal, the offered approach meets the topic goal of lowering design, development, and vehicle subsystem production costs by developing advanced and innovative technology. The integrated thermo-mechanical analysis capability is required by turbopump designers in order to support low cost turbopump development for Second Generation RLVs and other applications. Turbopump requirements include better performance and reliability, lower product cost, reduced size and weight, and improvements in product development cycle time. More efficiently and effectively analyzing turbopump system thermal and transient response may be the most challenging aspect of turbopump design and integration into the propulsion system. The proposed work also has tremendous dual use potential for designers of industrial turbomachinery products.",

Condor will demonstrate system performance in both laboratory and field tests.Our approach does not require specialized high-speed signal processors or new signal intelligence databases.This proposal is a significant step towards a commercially available, low-cost receiver and VME card processor that would serve as an adjunct to conventional ESM/ radar.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this project is to develop colloidal thrusters capable of producing the thrust levels required to overcome drift and maintain individual microsatellites at their assigned positions. In the Phase I research on this project, we showed that the use of capillarity driven flow of non-volatile propellant liquid through a porous matrix or wick could produce extremely stable electrosprays in vacuum of charged droplets. Inherent in this use of wick injection is that the flow rate of propellant liquid, and thus the thrust level for a particular thruster, is determined entirely by the applied voltage without any need for additional flow rate control circuitry. Moreover, this inherent simplicity, relative to other colloidal propulsion systems, means that multiplexing of such wick injectors is simple and straight-forward so that any desired level of thrust over a wide range can be achieved simply by varying the number of these simple wick thrusters. The objective of the proposed Phase II research is to implement the results of our Phase I research by designing, constructing and testing prototype wick thrusters with both conventional needle designs and to investigate similar applications using MEMS technology.",

We have used a highly diverse,           oriented peptide library approach to identify small peptide ligands for CXCR4.       The goals of this research are to characterize the CXCR4 inhibitors identified       so far, identify additional lead series, and carry out the optimization of the       lead series with respect to antiviral potency and selectivity. The properties        of the consensus-identified CXCR4-binding peptides will be characterized             according to their signalling properties, their ability to inhibit gp120             binding, their cellular toxicity, their specificity for the CXCR4 receptor, and      their ability to block HIV infection. The identification and clinical                development of a peptide which blocks the binding of HIV to CXCR4 will result        in an important new therapeutic class in the arsenal for use against AIDS.

The COMPASS consists of two components, the COMPASS Screen and         the COMPASS Psychosocial Battery (PB). The Screen serves to evaluate the             adaptive significance of the individual's chronic pain whereas the PB provides       pain-related psychosocial information. Six studies will be conducted in Phase        II. In Study 1, we will replicate the factor structure of the COMPASS Screen         via confirmatory factor analysis in a representative, national sample of             adults, develop national norms by gender and three age groups, gather                additional validity data on the Screen, and evaluate possible gender and             ethnicity bias. We plan to assess retest reliability, social desirability            response bias, concurrent validity, and to conduct confirmatory factor analysis      of the Psychosocial Battery (PB) in a national sample of adults with chronic         pain in Study 2.

In Study 5, we plan to gather                     representative, national norms for the PB for gender and three age groups.           Finally, in Study 6 we will examine the predictive validity of the PB. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The COMPASS will be employed as an aid to treatment planning and evaluation in traditional pain management settings (e.g., pain clinics, rehabilitation settings) as well as in primary care and general mental health settings.

Phase I research showed exceptionally broad emission from Yb 3+, efficient energy transfer in co-doped glasses, and fluorescence lifetimes and spectra of Tm and Er that meet device requirements at high dopant concentrations. Feasibility of scaled-up production of the glasses was demonstrated. The Phase II activities include: collaboration with firms engaged in the glass and optical device business; scaled-up glass synthesis; optimization of dopant concentration and optical properties for devices; and construction and characterization of prototype laser devices. Markets for optical device products are extremely large, multinational, and growing though expanded applications and displaced technologies. The Phase II R&D; is focused on lasers, amplifiers, and optical devices for communications, laser surgery, and emerging military applications. The patent position and the absence of complex proprietary interests in the technology place this work in a strong commercial position",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"In many applications of current and near-future interest, significant departures from Fourier's law are observed in the thermal conduction processes of engineering materials important to Army applications.  Such discrepancies may  result in inadequateprotection, excessive weight or premature hardware failure.  To correct this, non-Fourier conduction modeling can be exploited to optimize current design tools.  In particular, the dual phase lag (DPL) thermal model can be used to provide a very generaldescription for the thermal response of many materials both at the microscale and macroscale.  In Phase I, we successfully developed a 1D DPL model and demonstrated potential thermal lag problems with a rocket nozzle design.  In Phase II, we propose to:(i) develop a 3D finite element model of the DPL equation; (ii) construct an easy-to-use graphical interface to simplify problem set up; (iii) interface the DPL model with the ABAQUS finite element software; and (iv) conduct experiments to determine thephase lags for selected materials used by the Army.  Successful completion of this effort will provide the Army with the software and material data necessary to analyze rapid thermal transients in rocket nozzles, and heat transfer in various applicationssuch as nanotechnology, laser technology, and MEMS.\"",

Vehicle design at this scale is constrained by performance limitations inherent in operating at low Reynolds number. This effort will exploit new, lightweight Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuation devices and sophisticated design optimization tools to create an adaptive micro-rotor system with the potential for doubling the useful load or endurance MRCs. New SMA device technology will allow improved performance for diverse rotorcraft operating conditions while drawing minimal steady-state power, and will be the enabling technology for a family of adaptive rotor designs for next generation MRCs. Phase I will exploit recent insights into low Re airfoil behavior as well as enhancements to established rotorcraft modeling and optimization software. A Phase II goal will be to produce new, comprehensive optimization software to support design of next generation rotorcraft concepts ranging from low Re MRCs and planetary exploration rotorcraft to advanced full-size multi-rotor aircraft. This software will form the foundation of a hierarchy of tools enabling multi-disciplinary optimization of rotorcraft, capitalizing on the high fidelity and computational speed of the core analysis.",

Continuum Dynamics, Inc. (CDI) proposes the development of a new pop-up vortex generator (PUVG) concept which will eliminate cruise and off-design drag penalties of conventional vortex generators through flush surface stowage and deliver the proven flow control of traditional vortex and micro-vortex generators when deployed. Key in the development of this new flow control device is the application of Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) technologies developed at CDI which allow: device stowage conforming to the application mold line; minimum power requirements through self-locking actuation; low weight and simplicity through elimination of bulky mechanical actuation; the potential for selective deployment optimization based on vehicle operating conditions; and the potential for retrofit on existing aircraft systems. The proposed Phase I effort will carry out the conceptual design, fabrication and experimental studies demonstrating proof of concept, which can then be carried to Phase II/III product development. PUVGs offer the building blocks for a distributed flow control system with the potential to optimize aircraft performance in critical flight conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Active boundary layer control is effective in controlling boundary layer dynamics, but imposes a penalty because of the power and hardware required. In Phase I a family of self-excited Flow Driven Oscillating Vortex Generators (FDOVGs), which oscillate at frequencies where the induced vortical flows have length scales that are of the order of the scale of the aerodynamic surface, and therefore are useful to control boundary layer dyamics, have been demonstrated. The FDOVGs receive power from the mean flow to operate and generate large amplitude oscillations. Deployment can be achieved with no external power by using a flow change to activate the FDOVG, or with external power by changing the geometry or stiffness of the FDOVG.The Phase II effort will provide the aerodynamicist with a new flow control actuator that can be integrated into aerodynamic components. Micro- as well as macro-scale devices with applications on micro air vehicles, unmanned vehicles, jetliners, and over the road vehicles such as tractor-trailer trucks can be developed. The FDOVG is a simple, inexpensive, reliable, and potentially single-part solution to providing effective flow control without significant penalty for a large variety of difficult applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A potentially key element of meeting NASA?s objective of dramatically increasing aviation system capacity is the utilization of runway independent aircraft (RIAs) to provide feeder service to major airports. Among the challenges in enabling high-volume terminal area RIA operations are identifying potential hazards of this flight regime and developing simulation technology for a complex aeromechanical environment involving the interaction of multiple types of air vehicles (e.g, RIA, fixed-wing,V/STOL). Fast, high-fidelity full-vehicle aeromechanical models and simulation tools are thus needed for RIAs that may be used in such roles. To meet this need, a suite of physics-based tools are being developed that capture challenging problems such as vortex wake encounters, modeling the airwakes of structures/terrain, ?self-interactions? such as vortex ring state, full vehicle gust response, and surface/ground vortex effects. Key technical innovations include novel fast viscous/turbulent wake decay methodologies tailored to RIAs, coupled with state of the art Real Time Free Wake simulation capabilities of CDI?s CHARM full-aircraft analysis. The effort will yield a Multiple Aircraft Simulation Tool (MAST) that will permit both off-line assessment and on-line, real-time flight simulation of RIA and non-RIA vehicles for flight planning, operational training, and evaluation of pilot workload and situational awareness requirements.",

This project will develop an innovative well stimulation technique, based on laboratory measurements of wettability alteration coupled with artificial intelligence, to design well treatments.  Phase I laboratory results demonstrated that the new technology works in the laboratory and that critical laboratory variables can be determined from field data.  The oil recovered with surfactants varied from 15 to 640% of the oil recovered with reservoir water alone.  Artificial Intelligence was used to correlate well logs with core information.  The correlations were then used to develop pseudo porosity, bulk volume oil, bulk volume water, and aspect ratio logs of seven wells.  These pseudo-logs were then correlated with the average oil rate of the first 12 producing months indicating that the methodology may extend to the incremental oil resulting from field experiments.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the project is to develop a new generation of functional MRI design and analysis software. The proposed software is designed to lead to an order of magnitude improvement over current methods in the estimation and detection of fMRI activation.   This phase II project has three main aims: 1. to extend the utilization of a optimal spatial filtering technique to increase the SNR in the fMRI signal; 2. to develop a computer-aided design tool to permit the creation of novel fMRI experiments; and 3. integration of this software into an integrated suite providing a wide variety of spatiotemporal measurements of human brain function from structural MRI, fMRI, EEG, and MEG.   The software will also incorporate methods to greatly increase the statistical power and reliability for detecting task-related physiological responses with fMRI, including the use of correlated noise compensation, and optimal spatial filtering. These methods will be applicable to both blocked and event-related paradigms. The software will generate optimal rapid-presentation event-related (RPER) fMRI designs. Such designs allow for new classes of functional imaging experiments and permit comparisons between fMRI and traditional electrophysiological or behavioral studies.   The software will be designed to be utilized within our suite of MRI software tools. In particular, the results will be able to be presented on flattened and inflated cortical surfaces for superior visualization. The area of multi-modal brain imaging will be greatly advanced by supporting event-related designs and cortical surface formats within a single computational platform.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The proposed would be of interest to researchers using functional MRI, i.e., well over 1000 worldwide and growing rapidly. The proposed software will increase the functionality of fMRI by at least 20% but we propose to sell it for only about 0.1% of the fMRI equipment cost. Put another way, the proposed software could have the number offMRI sessions needed to achieve a given level of significance, and thus would play for itself after a single study.",

Completion of Phase I was the development of the AspiraideTM, a device that successfully mimicked the beneficial mechanisms of clinically used leeches. The skin flap therapy device was designed to minimize regulatory and manufacturing complexities. Phase II includes developing appropriately fabricated, labeled, and packaged devices for testing and preparing for commercial distribution. Due to the lack of a standard of care involving leeches, a clinical treatment schedule will be developed. Using a venous congested skin flap porcine model, research can lead to a standardized treatment regimen. The pig an optimal model for clinical relevance due to many similarities between human and porcine skin and wound healing properties between. The second portion will be using the AspiraideTM on human patients with venous congestion as part of a pilot clinical study to prove equivalency to leeches in the promotion of survival of venous congested tissues. Success of these tasks will lead to a commercially viable product.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Phase II program has two key aspects: Coulter Associates will build on its successful SBIR Phase I wristwatch device to develop an innovative and even more highly miniaturized tactile device specifically for infants. This device will provide vibrotactile stimulation on the infant's forearm to create an awareness of their acoustic and speech environment. This device will be self contained, non-invasive and will fundamentally do no harm whether the infant is deaf or normal hearing.   The second aspect is to use subjects referred from Virginia's Universal Newborn Hearing Screening Program and whose parents volunteer for a pilot study from birth to 7 months. The subjects that screen for the program will be fitted with a continuously worn infant vibrotactile aid at the first week after birth. The program will conduct Visual Reinforcement Audiometry and Heart Rate Audiometry tests to assure the infant's response to the acoustic environment at 3, 6 and 7 months after birth.   If successful, this SBIR program will make available means to improve the early pre-language neural development of deaf infants which should result in improved language development that more closely approximate that for normal hearing infants.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The proposed Pilot Test will provide a basis on which to evaluate the value of fitting all hearing impaired newborn infants with an infant vibrotactile aid.  The aid does no harm in cases of false positives and does not preclude any later intervention options.  The infant device will be suitable for mass production as a low cost consumer electronic device for dispensing by audiological professionals.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65209     As distributed generation accounts for an increasing share of electrical power, real-time sensory information (to monitor voltage, current, power flow, power quality, etc.) that describes the status of each generation point is required to maintain reliable electrical grid operation and ensure safe maintenance practices.  However, many of the monitoring points in today's electrical grid provide incorrect data due to faulty wiring, poor equipment performance, or lack of utility resources to process raw sensor data. In addition, many sensors are needed to replace aging instrument transformers, equip new generation plants, and monitor new locations within the transmission and distribution grids. The installation of new sensor technology should require as little infrastructure change as possible, in order to minimize total cost.  This project will develop a low maintenance, self-powered, clamp-on power interface pod for metering, for identifying incipient equipment failure, and for power quality processing.  It will rely on wireless communication to interface with a centralized control center, specific equipment at a distributed energy resource, and individual consumers.  In Phase I, the voltage monitor, current monitor, and power supply for the clamp-on sensor pod were evaluated, and a viable scheme for achieving 0.3% accuracy class for both voltage and current was developed.  In Phase II, a final design for the current sensor, voltage sensor, wireless communication system, and power supply will be completed as part of the integrated pod design.  Additional prototypes will be built for field trials, which will include at least one installation in a nationally recognized utility system.                 Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A clamp-on power interface pod, suitable for use at low, medium, or high voltages, should directly address an annual $1 billion worldwide electric utility market for voltage and current sensors alone.  The clamp-on design, with no insulating structure between high voltage and ground, would permit improved installation flexibility, low installation and maintenance costs, and low manufacturing costs.  The pod also could be used to support other types of sensors, for example, enabling the deployment of a nationwide network of sensors relevant to homeland security",

Memory interventions show promise as a behavioral technique to help staff and family caregivers improve the quality of life for people with dementia. Market potential exists for an ngaging group activity for persons with dementia that provides appropriate levels of cognitive and physical involvement, accesses long-term memories, focuses attention and concentration, provides a high probability of success for people at different levels of dementia and in different cohorts, and is water-proof and washable. Memory Magic is an activity designed to meet these criteria. Phase I feasibility testing revealed that Memory Magic elicited both higher quality and amount of engagement than standard programming, produced more positive and less negative affect, and was related to a reduction in inappropriate behaviors compared to levels seen in regular activity programming. Specific aims of Phase II research are o continue research and development efforts by improving the design, developing      \r  mass manufacturing capabilities, and testing refined versions across multiple      \r  sites in the Midwest, South, East and West resulting in a market-ready Memory      \r  Magic game for Phase II commercialization.",

With this product, they will be able to use public data on cost, utilization, and quality to find out how they rate compared to their peers and then set targets for improvement. The software product will be based on Data Envelopment Analysis, a mathematical technique for comparing \"decision-making units\" using several performance measures. Although Data Envelopment Analysis has been applied to the nursing home industry as a research tool, we propose to make Data Envelopment Analysis an operational tool, accessible to people with little knowledge of the underlying technique. In Phase I, we built a prototype of this product as a spreadsheet add-on and used it to experiment with data from nursing homes in Massachusetts. Based on this experience, we developed a methodology for guiding users through the various steps of the analysis. We propose now to develop a nationwide database of state and federal data on nursing homes along with a full-fledged software product incorporating our methodology.",

A representative example of this type of system, and the primary focus of the proposed Phase 2, is the DART telescope concept currently being advanced at JPL. Of immediate interest are multi-degree-of-freedom parallel actuator hexapod systems that can be used to adjust the orientation of the two primary reflectors relative to one another in the presence of manufacturing, deployment, and on-orbit disturbances. The desirability and feasibility of such systems was established in the course of Phase 1 activities. In Phase 2 we propose the continued development and hardware demonstration of hexapods with asymmetric attachment planes and suchsystems capable of functioning at the cryogenic temperatures required for infrared science as well as laying the groundwork for scaling up to on-orbit implementation. The developed systems will support the DART, and other space science, technology development efforts and lead to eventual in space applications as well as anticipated commercial/terrestrial spin-offs.",

To eliminate this problem and to provide a path for growth into the future, NASA needs to start afresh and obtain a new generation of analysis tools that take advantage of modern software technologies and computational environments. A new analyzer would not have size limits, it would be extensible with custom thermal objects, and would provide analysis techniques such as adaptive nodalization that do not exist in present tools. A new analyzer would provide for distributed computation, concurrent engineering and easy integration with, or embedding into, other tools. It would accept input diverse sources and would provide multiple forms of output and results analysis. It would not require a third party compiler for a simple analysis and would easily communicate with widely used tools such as Microsoft's Excel and Word.

Unfortunately, available exercise equipment is expensive and provides marginal benefits. In this Phase II project, we will continue to develop and evaluate an exercise system for individuals with SCI seeking to improve their physical fitness and/or enable use of a functional electrical stimulation system for standing.   The device uses electrical stimulation of lower-extremity musculature to generate a coupled hip/knee bending motion that moves the upper body against gravity. It provides the ability to perform strength and endurance training exercises in a manner that provides graded loading of the lower extremities. It consists of mechanical frame and a multi-channel stimulator with an adaptive controller to generate the desired movement and GRF profiles.   The Phase I project demonstrated feasibility by developing a prototype, evaluating it in experiments on human subjects with SCl, and identifying its limitations.The Phase II goals are to move towards Phase Ill commercialization by:1.  Designing and developing an improved device; 2.  Evaluating the ability to provide substantial exercise benefits in a clinical setting; 3.  Characterizing the biomechanics of the exercise; and 4.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term objective of this research is to establish ultrasound as a safe, effective, and non-invasive method for assessing fracture risk, an important component in clinical management of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis afflicts over 20 million people in the U.S., responsible for more than 275,000 hip fractures annually. Currently, the primary means for assessment relies on densitometric techniques. These methods subject the patient to ionizing radiation, are relatively expensive, and do not always provide good estimates of bone strength. Ultrasound offers several potential advantages. It is non-ionizing and relatively inexpensive. Moreover, since ultrasound is a mechanical wave and interacts with bone in a fundamentally different manner than electromagnetic radiation, it may be able to provide more accurate estimates of bone strength compared with current densitometric methods.   The goal of this research is to significantly improve the effectiveness of current ultrasonic bone assessment techniques by demonstrating the feasibility of a new ultrasonic system to assess bone. The system employs a novel parametric signal processing approach which is ideally suited for analog and real-time implementation. Thus this research may enable less expensive and easier to use ultrasound devices, which are also less sensitive to various experimental artifacts. The specific aims are to measure a set of new ultrasonic parameters and compare them with presently used features, namely BUA and ultrasound velocity, in calcaneal bone samples. A comparison will be made of their respective capabilities to estimate bone density and bone strength. This comparison will include cost, ease of use, and accuracy and precision of the bone density and bone strength estimates.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Osteoporosis is a major health concern in the United States, afflicting over 20 million people, and whose incidence is increasing as the average age of the U.S. population increases.  An effective, relatively inexpensive and safe technique such as ultrasound for assessing osteoporosis would be an extremely emportant benefit to the patient population, and represents an enormous commercial opportunity. Ultrasound's importance will grow as various new pharmacologic agents are approved for treatment, thus requiring periodic assessments of efficacy.",

Phase 1 feedback suggests the system would be a valuable clinical tool in some sectors of the health care market. 1) Hardware improvement: CYMA will make significant design changes to the SAM to facilitate manufacturing and improve quality while simultaneously reducing cost. 2) Software improvement: CYMA will expand the capabilities of the SAM software while maintaining ease-of-use. It will fully implement the web-based ordering system demonstrated in Phase 1. 3) Create knowledge base: Activity data is much more meaningful if there is comparative data available. CYMA will design, implement and test a normative database for the collection and distribution of normative data. 4) Demonstrate clinical usefulness: Selected test sites will work with CYMA to identify and demonstrate appropriate features and delivery models for the SAM. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The potential commercial applications are broad.  Cyma's primary target market is the clinical healthcare sector in which the device may be used to objectively quantify functional status, justify the need for intervention, inform treatment decisions, track progress and document outcome after intervention.  For this market, Cyma is anticipating a web-based service delivery model in which clinicians may order test via the Internet.  A second potential market is continuing care retirement centers.  Residents might be monitored periodically as a means for identifying functional decline and the need for intervention.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The overall objective of this proposal is to develop a flow cytometry- based assay utilizing optimized flow cytometry instrumentation and cultured mammalian cells that can be routinely employed by pharmaceutical and other companies to measure the mutagenic potential of chemicals and drugs. The assay is based on a Chinese hamster ovary- human hybrid cell line, CHO AL, which contains human chromosome 11. The principal target for mutation is the gene for the CD59 antigen which is encoded on chromosome 11. The hypotheses are(1) that mutations in chromosome 11 can be detected accurately, sensitively and rapidly by flow cytometry measurement of the loss or presence of surface antigens encoded by chromosome 11 and (2) that this mutation assay system can be developed so that it could be used routinely to determine the genotoxicity of physical and chemical agents. Specific Aim 1 is to build a relatively inexpensive benchtop flow cytometer optimized for analysis of antigen loss in mammalian cells. Specific Aim 2 is to validate the flow cytometry assay for detecting mutations in CHO AL cells by measuring the mutation dose response from a panel of 25 physical and chemical agents at a range of doses. Independent studies will be done at an off-site laboratory. Specific Aim 3 is to extend the assay to include the analysis of intragenic and chromosomal mutations by measuring the presence or absence of multiple antibodies bound to different cell surface antigens encoded by separate genes on human chromosome 11.  The development of this assay system would allow for rapid, accurate, relatively cheap but informative screening of pharmaceuticals for genotoxicity and substantially reduce the cost of carrying out mutation analysis.",

In order to meet system weight and performance goals while reducing manufacturing costs, integral heatshield/airframe concepts are needed.

NGDFS will process data from passive and active acoustic systems used in both traditional monostatic and bistatic modes.  It will also process data fromtraditional non-acoustic systems such as radar.  NGDFS will also have the capability to utilize non-Gaussian trackers along with computer resource optimization algorithms and high-performance, inexpensive, hardware to allow this computationally intensivedata fusion process to take place in near-real-time.  NGDFS will be able to utilize this non-Gaussian tracking information when determining the likelihood that a contact is associated with a particular target.  We will quantitatively analyze theperformance of NGDFS in our Decision Support System Testbed (DSST), using both real-world ASW/SUW data as well as simulated data containing many targets and both acoustic and non-acoustic sensors.

The center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), and the Rehabilitation Accreditation Commission (CARF) have participated in a joint study to determine feasibility of an accreditation model. Preliminary findings show that programs are indeed able to meet accreditation requirements. Danya International, Inc. developed the conceptual framework for a Performance measurement for Treatment Improvement (PMTI) Web-based application in Phase I of this project. The unique benefits of this system to methadone treatment programs include, but are not limited to, the following: presents accreditation guidelines; provides sample plans, policies, and procedures; provides access to automated performance measurement tools; provides data reports and analysis; compares local, state/county, and national benchmark data; guides staff through a quality improvement (QI) process; and provides ready-to-use QI tools and techniques. Danya is proposing to develop and program this Web-based application in Phase II. Specific aims of the project will be to complete the architecture design, complete the content development of the PMTI system, program the system using Web-based technologies, beta test the system, and conduct a users' assessment.",

This intervention package, designed for elementary school children, will include an Educational Video, Facilitators' Guide and Online Learning Center Website.  The products will educate and inform children's peers about cancer, foster peer acceptance of children with cancer, and thereby promote the healthy psychosocial adjustment of children with cancer.  In Phase I of the project, the content of the three components will be developed in conjunction with a panel of experts in the field (practitioners, teachers and parents) and a stakeholder group of parents, children with cancer, and their peers.  In Phase II, we will film the video, write the guide and program the website.  The intervention package will then be subjected to an evaluation in classrooms to determine if classmates learn from the intervention and the child with cancer benefits.  Children with cancer have an increased risk for adjustment problems during the period of reentry to school.  By providing a multimedia intervention designed to create a supportive peer environment in the classroom, the frequency and severity of problems should diminish.  Once completed, the School Reentry Program will be marketed to schools, families and children. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Presently, no multimedia, integrated intervention package for elementary school-aged children with cancer exists.  Once completed, the proposed School Reentry Program for Children with Cancer will be marketed to diagnosed children, their families, and providers, as well as school systems and relevant advocacy organizations.  Theses market segments will be reached  through a combination of public relations opportunities and traditional marketing techniques such as direct mail, advertising, and creating distribution relationships with stakeholders in the field.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In Phase I, we explored and developed a concept for a versatile and robust locomotion methodology based on snake and worm morphologies. These creatures have evolved versatile techniques for mobility that can be mimicked by robots operating in complex unknown workspaces such as in rough debris fields or in diverse media such as water, sand, slush, or ice, as may be found on Mars or Europa. While we found a significant amount of prior research in related areas, it was confined to laboratory experiments in relatively benign environments, and none exhibited the ability of a mechanism to transition from one environment to another. For commonality of parts, our concept uses a single module design based on a three degree-of-freedom parallel kinematic linkage that is connected in series. The modules monitor their own specific orientations, which are then summed by a central processor. The vehicle's protective skin is one of the critical areas of innovation because it must resist abrasion and corrosion, yet be flexible and elastic. In Phase II, we will construct a working prototype, and conduct a series of experiments, both on the test bench and in the field, toward developing algorithms for locomotion.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Deep sea exploration and retrieval of biological and geological samples is an expensive undertaking. Apart from the cost of designing and building vehicles for these functions, ship operations to support deep dives of piloted or remote-operated vehicles are only within reach of a few governmental and large private organizations. Autonomous-operated vehicles are less expensive. However, due to inefficient acoustic communications they are difficult to locate and control. We will design and test a new generation of deep-sea craft that will substantially reduce costs of sample collection. These vehicles will require small to modest support vessels, be simple to operate, readily controlled and tracked, and have efficient communication systems. They will be unmanned, eliminating the risk of injury and the need to maintain a pressure hull. The room saved can be used for sampling and instrumentation. The proposed vehicles will permit many more small organizations and businesses to participate in the future economic development of deep-sea natural resources.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The use of tobacco represents a significant public health problem, with specific effects on oral tissue.  These effects provide dental health care workers (DHCWs) to help patients quit, yet, the majority of dental professionals cite lack of training as a barrier to providing these services.  There is a need for disseminable, empirically-validated tobacco education. Interactive computer-based programs can meet this need. The primary goal of the \"A Dental Education Program in Tobacco\" (ADEPT) project is to develop an interactive computer-based program to train DHCWs to provide brief, office-based tobacco cessation interventions to patients.  During Phase I, we developed and evaluated a prototype program.  During Phase II, we will completely revise the interactive training CD-ROM based on the evaluation data, develop and evaluate a hybrid program that combines the best features of CD-ROM and Internet technologies, and create a Digital Versatile Disk (DVD) version of the program. Our team has extensive experience in developing interactive training programs, tobacco education for dental health care workers, and creating and evaluating Internet-based health programs, uniquely qualifying us to conduct the research proposed herein. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: We will produce an interactive training program for 520 professional schools for DHCWs and for continuing education of the estimated 150,000 dentists, 100,000 dental hygienists, and 200,000 dental assistants in the United States.  The program will teach DHCWs to provide a brief, office-based tobacco cessation intervention to their patients in the context of oral health care. Though stand-alone CD- ROM and Internet delivery, this program meets the goals of professional organizations and training programs, and offers a unique opportunity to learn behavioral skills that are not currently offered.",

Due to occluding building and trees, these environments make it impossible for a single sensor to monitor potentially threateningevents over an extended period of time.  Therefore, the command post must deploy and efficiently monitor a large number of video cameras in order to achieve complete perimeter coverage.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of integrating multiple videosteams originating from many disparate sources.  Phase II will continue the development of a multi-camera surveillance system that automatically monitors a large number of networked video cameras to detect operationally significant events in a clutteredurban landscape.  Specifically, this system will allow the operator to construct and specify events of interest using an intuitive event specification language, automatically monitor these events to reduce operator overload and error, and alert operatorsin real-time when pre-defined events of interest occur.  Improvements over state-of-the art will be measured in terms of significant event detection, false alarm mitigation, track length and continuity, system scalability, and the efficiency with a mobileoperator can remotely monitor a large number of concurrent video feeds.\"",

This process has resulted in severe limitations on system interoperability and technical obsolescence. In addition, excessive life cycle costs areassociated with maintaining multiple configurations to ensure some level of interoperability. To overcome these limitations, new emphasis has been placed on the use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technologies. To support the use of COTS, DSR hasdeveloped a real-time middleware framework for integrated combat systems and joint warfare coordination systems that is becoming widely used in the Navy. Transportable Middleware (TM) permits software developers to take advantage of the continuingtechnology advances in the commercial computing industry, because application software can be ported quickly. TM is being applied to the Cooperative Engagement Capability Processor (CEP) because of the desire to use a common software baseline on manydifferent hosts located on different platforms. The overall objective of this Phase I research is to extend TM by designing a suite of test and performance analysis tools that will minimize the need for complete regression testing when introducing newhardware and software. The ultimate goal is minimizing life-cycle cost, which is particularly crucial to the CEC Program.\"",

The algorithms apply to legacy sensors and weaponsystems that provide track outputs that can be correlated.Automatic dynamic sensor alignment is accomplished with asoftware solution that derives sensor alignment errors on a real-time basis with a software supplement to legacy systems andimplements software that calculates different biases and dynamicsthat cause sensor misalignments and provides automated alignmentcompensation. Using tightly coupled shipboard multi-sensor trackdata, the alignment compensation is computed in a time framecompatible with single look cueing of sensors and weapon systems.The research includes software development, integration andlaboratory and field testing with a legacy system.BENEFITS: Fleet improvements will result from this low cost COTS processor implementation with improved platform protection, extension of the missile defense battle timelin",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a family of membrane proteins that mediate the biological actions of neurotransmitters and hormones and are a major target for pharmaceutical drug development. Of the top 200 best selling drugs, over 40 of them target GPCRs and those drugs generate over $20 billion. At least 5 percent of the Human Genome expresses receptors, the vast majority of which are orphan receptors for which functions and selective ligands have not been identified. These orphan receptors could provide an important new family of targets for drug development. However, there are few, if any, assays that can be successfully employed to identify drugs against these receptors. In our Phase I SBIR grant, we developed a cell-based assay that can detect GPCR activation using our proprietary CEDIA technology. Specifically, we developed an assay to measure receptor activation of NFkB/IkB signaling. The promiscuity of intracellular signaling pathways linked to NFkB/IkB signaling provides an ideal basis for an assay to measure orphan receptors. The objective of this Phase II SBIR grant is to develop this receptor assay to the point of commercialization. We will determine the breath of applicability of our GPCR assay to measure stimulation of receptors acting via different second messenger signaling pathways as well as measuring responses to orphan receptor activation. We will optimize our assay to be measured in HTS format. To expand the utility of our GPCR assay, we will adapt the assay to directly measure the translocation of NFkB to the nucleus as a response to GPCR stimulation so that the entire assay can be done in intact cells in a very simple and easy-to-use format. In addition to measuring responses to GPCR activation, our NFkB/IkB signaling assay measured the stimulation of growth factor receptor activation. In this grant we will develop and optimize our assay to measure responses to growth factors to commercialize the first HTS assay for growth factor receptor antagonists. The goal of DiscoveRx is to develop a suite of technologies that can aid in the discovery of a new generation of therapeutically important drugs that act upon the large family of orphan GPCRs and growth factor receptors.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: We will develop a HTS assay to discover drugs against the large family of orphan GPCRs.  This market is in the billions of dollars.  We will also be able to commercialize an assay for the large family of growth factor receptors which is a comparable size market.  Finally, our nuclear translocation assay will be commercialized as a GPCR screen, but will also have applications in the discovery of drugs against transcription factors and drugs to modify gene expression.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         One of NASAs missions is to develop noninvasive models for monitoring the potentially deleterious effects of microgravity on human cell/tissue functions. Previous work has shown that gravitational changes can modify a variety of host cell-matrix interactions. Angiogenesis, an essential process for tissue growth and regeneration, is a coordinated process of activated endothelial cell proliferation and differentiation controlled by specific matrix and growth factor signals. However, little is known about the human angiogenesis process in microgravity, primarily due to the lack of defined functional models. We have created a new human biomatrix (Amgel) culture system which supports endothelial cell growth and function. This unique biomatrix simulates human cell morphogenesis only in the presence of specific modulators (FGF, VEGF). We now propose to employ this natural matrix to further develop an all-human angiogenesis model adaptable for microgravity studies. Endothelial cell cultivation models with controllable bioactivity utilizing Amgel-layered disk and microbead configurations will be evaluated in rotary culture systems. New 3-D bioassays, generated with GF-enriched matrix, would allow examination of both early mitogenic and late angiogenic events. This R&D; proposal should positively impact the fields of wound healing, tissue engineering and vascular disease.",

The novel phage display crystallization system is a high risk project that has a tremendous potential because the conditions for crystallization remain constant regardless of the protein molecule studied. The development of a multiple gene expression system, ?MaGEX,? for producing protein complexes also has a market that has drawn the interest and support of a premiere genetics company Athersys, Inc. for world wide commercialization. The development of the prototype MaGEX is required to implement the Trojan Phage technology. These products could result in a large number of proteins for structure determination which is synergistic with NASA?s Biological and Physical Research Enterprise that utilizes micro-gravitational effects to improve crystallization conditions. As part of the commercialization the systems would be offered as kits for expressing protein complexes recombinantly or for crystallization. In Phase I, we made significant progress in the construction of the MaGEX system which will be used to express the Trojan Phage. In Phase II, demonstration of the feasibility of this system to crystallize foreign proteins will begin.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65764    The Next Generation Linear Collider (NLC) will require 800 klystron modulators capable of providing 500 kV, 500 A pulses at 120 Hz.  The losses and non-ideal pulse characteristics inherent in currently available pulse transformers are a significant impediment to high performance, highly efficient modulator systems.  Further, modulator inefficiencies translate directly into increased operating costs.  This project will design, build, and assess a toroidal, low impedance pulse transformer for the NLC klystron modulators, which significantly improves on available designs.  Two full-scale designs will be constructed and tested with existing switch technologies, including a solid state switch.  Phase I analyzed the materials, design, and construction of a toroidal pulse transformer capable of achieving the NLC modulator requirements with high efficiency.  The design was assessed for cost, efficiency, and reliability within a NLC klystron modulator, and a full-scale, very high power, pulse transformer was designed for construction in Phase II.  Pulse transformer efficiency improvements of 20  50% (equivalent to overall power efficiency improvements of 3  10%) were shown to be realizable through this approach.  Two toroidal pulse transformers will be built and assessed in Phase II.  The first will be a quarter-scale model to verify the design and analysis and to demonstrate the commercial potential of this technology within the medical/industrial accelerator market.  Then, a full-scale NLC toroidal transformer will be built and tested at full NLC voltage and power at SLAC.                         Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Pulsed power systems are increasingly important to new materials modification and treatment processes, such as plasma source ion implantation.  Cost effective, very high peak power systems may enable the development of new manufacturing and materials processing techniques across a wide range of industrial and medical applications, including semiconductor fabrication, medical treatment systems, radar, and food sterilization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hot start is beneficial or necessary for efficiency and reliability of a large portion of PCR reactions. The most demanding PCR reactions are especially dependent on a hot start. A heat switch can be added to PCR protocols by any of several manual or built-in methods, all of which have drawbacks, such as narrow conditions, extra expense, extra steps, prone to error, prone to cross-contamination, and/or lack of applicability to long PCR. We proposed to develop a Taq DNA polymerase mutant that is heat-switchable, which is much less active than the wild-type at room (reaction setup) temperature, yet normally active at 65-70 degrees, and still resistant to 95 degrees.   In Phase I we were able to isolate and initially characterize several mutants of Klentaq DNA polymerase that outperformed the parent enzyme in hot start PCR. We will test single amino acid changes found in these mutants to identify the ones that confer cold-sensitivity. We also plan to optimize the amino acid substitutions for each functionally significant mutation site. The best mutants will also be used to engineer cold-sensitive Taq DNA polymerase. Finally, we will purify mutant and combined-mutant enzymes to test their advantages in demanding PCR (short and long) that requires a hot start under a broad range of conditions.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Hot-start methods for PCR more and more important to efficiency and reproducibility. An estimated 10-15% of the assays performed employ one of the current methods, with cost being a significant factor. Benefitting the most from hot start are forensic and diagnostic applications of PCR. Other important benefits are food and blood contamination PCR assays. All of these assays are rapidly growing areas and could benefically employ the proposed enzyme.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Improvements in signal to noise ratio (SNR) and ease of use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) RF coils are needed to improve image quality and patient throughput. The goal of this Phase II project is to continue the development of novel rf coil topologies and rf balancing circuits that have demonstrated substantially improved  technical performance, reduced cost, and greatly simplified tuning procedures. The success of the Phase I effort  demonstrated the unique contributions possible with our advanced, proprietary, simulation software and patented coil  technology. The circular polarization (CP) coils built and tested during Phase I demonstrated an improvement of a factor of 3 to 15 (depending on the reference CP technology) in tunability (ability to tune and match efficiently over a wide range of sample loading conditions at very high fields) for equivalent BI homogeneity. Also, much higher B1 homogeneity is maintained over the full range of load conditions. Substantial improvements were also achieved in signal to noise ratio (SNR) and passive Bo shimming, and further gains are expected here during Phase II. We denote these coils \"litzcages\", as they embody both paralleled conductor elements with insulated crossovers similar to that in our prior \"litz coil\" technology and capacitively segmented phase shifts and four-point drive to achieve highly stable circular polarization.  We have demonstrated feasibility of a quadrature, single-tuned, semi-open, passively shimmed rf litzcage with an axially asymmetric field profile. The Phase I saw the development and bench testing of numerous linear and CP litz coils, including one for human knee studies at 3 to 6 T, one for small-animal research at 500 MHz, one for single-resonance human head MRI at 3-4 T, and one for double-resonance human head MRI at 1.5 T.  The Phase II will continue with the development and field testing of quadrature single-resonance litzcages optimized for human head, knee, neck, and torso at 3-7 T, as well as smaller CP litzcages for animal research at the highest fields. Preliminary development of a 3 T double-resonance multinuclear 'HM head coil utilizing our linear litz  coils is also planned. The primary objective is to permit a substantial increase in MRI patient throughput (thereby reducing scan costs) via relatively inexpensive upgrades of head, knee, neck, and torso rf coils in existing high-field MRI scanners and/or to enable the more detailed diagnostic studies that are currently not practical because image acquisition time would be excessive. Field testing of a 3 T 'H head coil and a 3 T knee coil will begin early in Phase II at the Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA. The FDA approval process for head, knee, and neck coils will also  begin during the Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will refine the polymer matrix of glass fiber composites with ion exchangers in order to enhance their longevity in the alkaline environment of concrete. Glass fiber composites offer a desirable balance of performance and cost for replacement of corrosion-prone steel reinforcement in concrete; their rapid deterioration in the alkaline environment of concrete is, however, a major setback. Ion exchangers are insoluble solids carrying cations (or anions) which can be exchanged with ions of the same sign. Cation exchangers of hydrogen form replace alkali metal cations (e.g., K + in alkaline solutions diffusing into the polymer matrix) with H + . This exchange of cations neutralizes aggressive alkaline solutions by converting K + OH - (and Na + OH - , etc.) into H2O. Through laboratory investigations and industrial-scale pultrusion efforts, the Phase I research demonstrated that introduction of selected ion exchangers into the polymer matrix (or a surface layer of matrix) does not interfere with the pultrusion process, and yields significant gains in alkali resistance of glass fiber composites. The Phase I effort also established a theoretical context for selection of the dosage of cation exchanger in the polymer matrix of glass fiber composites, and verified the economic viability of our approach. The proposed Phase II project will: (1) develop refined theoretical principles and design procedures for formulation of polymer matrices with ion exchangers; (2) develop and experimentally verify optimum polymer matrix formulations incorporating ion exchangers; (3) optimize the pultrusion process of glass fiber composites with the refined polymer system, and fully characterize the end products; and (4) evaluate the structural performance and durability of concrete systems reinforced with refined glass fiber composite bars through comprehensive laboratory studies complemented with a field investigation involving design, construction and monitoring of a reinforced concrete bridge deck. The Phase II effort will receive critical support from major manufacturers of composite rebars (including Hughes Brothers, the world leader in this field), the leading supplier of ion exchangers (Dow Chemical), Michigan Department of Transportation, and Michigan Economic Development Corporation. Michigan State University (Composite Materials & Structures Center) will also take part in the proposed research effort. Close to one-third of reinforced concrete structures, including bridges, parking structures, buildings in coastal areas and offshore structures, are exposed to corrosive environments (deicer salt, seawater spray, etc.); domestic sales of steel for reinforcement of these concrete structures is about $2 billion/yr. Glass fiber composites embodying our technology are resistant to both corrosive effects and the alkaline environment of concrete; they offer a desirable balance of performance and cost to replace steel reinforcement in corrosive environments. Major savings in life-cycle cost can be realized at competitive initial cost through replacement of steel reinforcement with alkali-resistant glass fiber composites in concrete structures exposed to corrosive environments. Glass fiber composite jackets and sheets applied onto concrete surfaces for repair/rehabilitation purposes are also prone to attack by the alkaline pore solution of concrete, representing another market opportunity for our technology. We have filed a patent application, and have reached agreements with Dow Chemical (leading supplier of ion exchangers) and Hughes Brothers (world's leading manufacturer of composite bars for concrete reinforcement) towards transfer of the technology to marketplace",

The effectiveness of hairpin RNA (inverted repeat) constructs that target iaaM will be compared to the opposing-promoter constructs which conferred crown gall resistance to 12% of the transgenic apple trees produced during phase I studies. Although not critical, a higher success rate will aid in the introduction of the gall-resistance trait into a commercially useful apple rootstock. 2. To test whether protection is broad enough to be commercially useful, a variety of pathogenic Agrobacterium strains will be used to challenge apple lines that exhibit resistance to octopine-type A. tumefaciens. 3. Apple lines that silence A. tumefaciens oncogenes and prevent gall formation will be examined for transgene expression, copy number, and structure. 4. Intron-containing constructs that encode hairpin iaaH will also be tested for their ability to confer crown gall resistance. Transgenic plants that silence both iaaM and iaaH may have more durable gall resistance than lines that silence only one of these oncogenes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65357       Future linear colliders require efficient and cost effective high power radio frequency (rf) sources to accelerate electron/positrons.  This project will develop a ceramic rf power extractor as a simple device to meet this need.  In the ceramic rf power extractor, a train of high-charge electron bunches travels down the axis of a dielectric lined, circular metallic waveguide, radiating rf power into the ceramic tube.  The radiated power is then extracted from the ceramic tube and coupled to an output waveguide for subsequent use.  In Phase I, the properties of the rf power extractor were studied theoretically and numerically, and a ceramic power extractor capable of producing over 100 megawatts was designed.  The ceramic material was specified, fabricated, and tested for dielectric properties and conformity to specifications.  Fabrication and test plans for the ceramic rf power extractor were made.  Phase II will design and build a high-power (500 MW), high-efficiency (>95%) ceramic rf power extractor, and test it at a high-power test stand in a national laboratory.  As an intermediate goal, the 100 MW ceramic rf power extractor designed in Phase I will be built and tested for power handling and breakdown characteristics.  Phase II also includes studies of higher order modes and beam breakup issues for the ceramic power extractor in a two beam acceleration scheme.                               Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The dielectric-based rf power source should substantially simplify the design and reduce the cost of high power rf transfer structures in future linear colliders.  Beyond high energy physics and commercial accelerator applications, the ceramic rf power extractor could be used as a high-frequency, high-power signal generator capable of producing megawatts of power at high frequencies for such applications as long-range telecommunications at high-rate data transfer.",

Instruments are needed to monitor the health of these fragile eco-systems on an ongoing basis. Duncan Technologies, Inc. proposes the development of a compact, portable digital imager that delivers 5 bands of geo-referenced, pixel-registered imagery in the visible, near infrared, and thermal infrared spectral bands. Several innovative techniques will be implemented to address the unique issues of data acquisition in coastal and marine environments. A fast sequential exposure system will generate image pairs with different exposure settings to cover the large albedo created by the combination of water and vegetation in the field of view. The image pairs will be fused into a single image with expanded sensitivity. A radiometric moisture measurement will enable correction for atmospheric effects in the acquired data. Automated camera control algorithms will maximize information content by maintaining an optimal operating point. Resolution of the thermal band will be enhanced by techniques that extract additional spatial data from the other spectral bands. The imager system will consist of an imaging head and control unit in a compact, portable package for easy application on platforms ranging from aerial to shipboard systems.",

We will conduct more substantial R & D efforts and include generalized environmental input and boundary conditions. The performance of the code will be improved by implementing more efficient memory and CPU utilization methods and optimized discretization schemes. The code will be further validated with results from the literature and small-scale controlled experiments. This tool will enable users to predict transient loads of moving ships on one another, on moored ships, and on banks and coastal structures, and to derive hydrodynamic coefficients for real-time simulators.

Cavitation is known to produce reactions in water resulting in organic compound oxidation. We have demonstrated that jet-induced cavitation can oxidize selected organic compounds with two orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency than other methods such as ultrasonics. We propose to utilize jet cavitation to accomplish three water reclamation functions for advanced space life support: total organic carbon (TOC) reduction, microorganism reduction, and oxygenation. Phase I will investigate the feasibility of using jet cavitation for these three functions. Phase II will consider a broader range of contaminants and microorganisms, a detailed parametric study to obtain optimization relations, and issues of integration into a space based life support system.",

Inspired by the biological example of cooperative nest building by social insects, the architecture's robotic construction agents perform their construction duties stigmergically, i.e., without direct inter-agent communication and without a preprogrammed global blueprint of the final design. Communication and coordination between individual agents occurs indirectly through sensed modifications made to the structure by each agent. Phase I simulations have established that an idealized form of the proposed architecture was indeed capable of producing representative large space structures with autonomous robots. During Phase II, the prototype multi-robot architecture will be comprehensively developed. The idealized robot subsystem models utilized in Phase I will be replaced with detailed engineering models. Phase II research objectives include the development of a comprehensive simulation of the cooperative multi-robot control architecture, development of parametric design relationships between the key robotic subsystems, and a system demonstration using commercial robotic hardware. It is anticipated that the Phase II research program will lead to a robust multi-robot control strategy that will make the use of autonomous robots a viable option for the assembly of future large space structures.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"We propose research in the context of a larger program to deliver, in FY 2007, a multi-sensor system to counter buried mines. For tactical use, this demonstration may require two subsystems: one that makes a rapid wide area environmental assessment and asecond system that performs the buried mine hunting in areas when and where the first system has shown it is feasible.    Countering buried sea mines will require the use of a multiplicity of sensors including low frequency sonar. In order to achieve tactically useful resolution with a LF sonar on a practical search platform, synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) processing willbe required. The use of SAS at low frequencies for buried targets has a number of consequences that we propose to explore and quantify. These areas include: the use of broad-band/beam sonars, adaptive algorithms that use the special characteristics of SASto gain additional information about buried objects, and the application of SAS to \"acoustic color\" sensing. We will also investigate other sensor capabilities and the performance of multiple sensor systems. For the Phase II option, we propose to develop apreliminary design for a system that might meet the FY 2007 demonstration goals.BENEFITS: There is no current capability to counter buried mines and therefore if the threat is sufficiently large in some location, the fleet will avoid that area. Solving this problem will give the fleet new maneuver options that it doe",

(DTI) will develop, test, and build a set of real-time environmental noise reduction algorithms to be used in conjunction with the prototype Multimode Magnetic Detection System (MMMDS) being sponsored by the Office of NavalResearch (ONR).  The MMMDS consists of two airborne, spatially separated, laser-pumped helium magnetometers capable of being processed in either single-signal mode, signal-differential (gradiometer) mode, or single-sensor with surface based referencesensor mode.  The DTI algorithms will operate in each of these modes, and will be designed to cancel much of the environmental noise present in both the magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) and extremely low frequency emission (ELFE) bands.  The environmentalnoises to be treated include those resulting from non-stationarity of the geomagnetic field, aircraft translation over subsurface magnetic anomalies, and buffeting through the geomagnetic gradient.  An adaptive noise cancellation module will also bedeveloped based on an algorithm derived by another project member.The proposed Phase II effort consists of four tasks, plus two options.  During the baseline effort DTI will develop a signal/noise simulator, perform system performance analyses, developprototype algorithms, and deliver a real-time processor design.  In the options, the algorithms will be evaluated using test data, and a real-time processor will be built.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver disease remains a major challenge for accurate differential diagnosis. Several different types of lesions are commonly found in the liver. Liver is a prime focus for metastatic extension of numerous malignancies. Often, both benign and malignant lesions co-exist. It is critical for optimal treatment planning and follow-up to clearly differentiate each lesion type. Despite advances in technology, a large lumber of lesions are missed or incorrectly diagnosed. There remains a clear need for improved imaging 3gents that maximize the capabilities of rapidly evolving diagnostic technologies. Diagnosis of liver pathology using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to be limited by the lack of a liver-specific imaging agent with a well-defined vascular phase. Eagle Vision Pharmaceutical Corp. is developing EVP-ABD, a manganese-based MRI agent, to address unmet needs for improved differential diagnosis of liver and abdominal diseases. Studies demonstrated the unique magnetic and kinetic properties of EVP-ABD provide high levels of enhancement for both blood vessels and liver. Additional studies have demonstrated a safety profile similar to marketed agents. These features should overcome limitations to the use of MRI for liver and provide better discrimination between various malignant and benign lesions. Such potential will be assessed in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Phosphoinositides are key lipid second messengers in cellular signaling. No approved diagnostics evaluate lipids as markers for cancer, but analysis of lipids in addition to protein and DNA may enhance overall accuracy of diagnosis and simultaneously suggest a molecular target for treatment. The tumor promoter phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) regulates protein trafficking, proliferation and differentiation, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis. Both PI 3-K and its lipid product PI(3,4,5)P3 are potential tumor markers for the early detection of cancer. PI(3,4,5)P3 accumulation is exacerbated by mutations in the tumor suppressor PTEN, a lipid 3-phosphatase. In Phase I, Echelon has demonstrated feasibility and developed reagents and assay platforms to measure PI 3-K activity and to measure lipid product PI(3,4,5)P3 in high-throughput microplate assays. In addition, we have developed and produced two monoclonal antibodies to PI(3,4,5)P3 that show striking results in immunodetection of PI(3,4,5)P3 in pathology samples from breast, ovarian, prostate, and colorectal cancers. In Phase II, we will validate our methods for identification of PI(3,4,5)P3 levels in drug discovery assays and in serum/cell extract detection formats. Anti- PI(3,4,5)p3, antibodies will be used for immunohistochemistry of cancer samples with known disease progression. The data will be analyzed quantitatively and used to establish protocols for human clinical trials to validate the prognostic value of these lipid markers for aggressive cancers. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Microplate assays for PI 3-K and PI(3,4,5)P3 quantification have value in research, clinical, and drug development settings. Systematic screening of cell extracts and pathology samples will allow rapid and early detection of an important molecular lesion in many cancers.",

Echo Technologies, Inc., completed a Phase I project that demonstrated a new approach for the identification of bacteria in aqueous systems. The approach uses bacteriophage as the molecular recognition element. Bacteriophage are virus particles that generally attach to and infect a narrow range of host cells. Biosensors based on this molecular recognition offer a rapid, selective, and potentially very sensitive method to detect bacteria and bacterial pathogens in potable and recreational waters.Feasibility of the concept was demonstrated by fabricating fluorescently labeled virus probes (FLVPs) to detect and identify bacteria for representative waterborne bacteria, including: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Vibrio natriegens bacteria. The preparation of FLVPs has been made quite reproducible. The adhesion to host cells is very rapid, good selectivity was demonstrated in samples with host cells and mixtures, and the response from a solid-phase FLVP biosensor was demonstrated. Several experiments were conducted with a customized detection system to demonstrate the feasibility of making a small in-line instrument capable of high-sensitivity detection. These cumulative results lay an excellent foundation for the Phase II development effort. In Phase II, a prototype rapid bacteria identification system will be designed, fabricated, and evaluated in the laboratory and at an independent test facility. The heart of the instrument will be an array of encoded FLVPs integrated with a charge coupled device (CCD)-based imaging/detection system. Application of the FLVP technology to solid-state optical sensing represents a new approach to real-time detection of bacterial pathogens. This approach will minimize the need for culturing to identify pathogens, and is an important departure from immunoassay- or DNA-based sensing concepts. The miniature probes are perfectly suited for incorporation in a sensor array for the simultaneous detection of many bacterial pathogens.",

In Phase I, 100 lines of CS-transgenic tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum, were created and tested. Preliminary results with five hemizygous strains are promising, suggesting that higher-performing homozygous strains created at the end of Phase I may hyperaccumulate lead from soil (bioconcentration factor >1). Significantly, little soluble lead remained in the soil, indicating that the plants may successfully address leaching concerns. In Phase II, the highest performing transgenic lines will be demonstrated at a small arms firing range in Maryland and a residential site in Massachusetts. Phase II objectives also include concentrating lead in harvested plants to facilitate disposal or recycling, and mating transgenic lines of a proven lead-accumulating plant species, Brassica juncea.At many sites, applying rapidly biodegradable citric acid precisely at the root/soil interface where metal uptake occurs may eliminate the need for expensive chelating agents and liners. Attainment of the project's goals therefore may reduce the substantial public health hazard of soil lead by realizing phytoremediation's low-cost potential.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Arsenic contamination of drinking water poses significant health risks to millions of people worldwide. Current technologies used to clean arsenic-contaminated water have significant drawbacks, such as high cost and generation of large volumes of toxic waste. Edenspace Systems Corporation proposes to create the basis for a cost-effective phytofiltration technology using a recently identified arsenic hyperaccumulating fern to remove arsenic from drinking water to concentrations below regulatory limits. Phase I research demonstrates that the fern can rapidly reduce arsenic concentrations in a variety of source waters, achieving levels less than the new USEPA drinking water limit of 10 mug/L. Phase II research will further explore the fern's arsenic removal capability by varying such important water treatment factors as arsenic valences, water pH, dissolved minerals including iron, sulfur, sodium and calcium compounds, chlorination/fluoridation, intensity and spectrum of light, and fern size and root density. The work will culminate in a continuous process demonstration conducted in collaboration with the City of Albuquerque, New Mexico and Virginia Department of Health. The anticipated results of this research may provide the foundation for development of a solar-powered (photosynthetic) hydroponic technique that enables cost-effective, small-scale cleanup of arsenic-contaminated drinking water.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this Phase II project is to design and validate three additional computerized instructional programs, called 'Virtual Workshops,' that will be used to provide professional development experiences to secondary content-area teachers who deliver instruction to academically diverse inclusive classes in which students with disabilities are enrolled. The Virtual Workshops are to serve as comparable alternatives to traditional teacher-development programs when these traditional programs cannot be accessed or as supplementary materials for teacher-training courses. The focus of each Virtual Workshop will be on an empirically validated teaching routine that has been designed for delivering complex information in required subject-area courses. This project will result in inexpensive, effective, interactive professional development programs on CD ROMs for teachers. The Virtual Workshop will: (a) allow new teachers immediate access to training; (b) provide teachers timely access to state-of-the-art innovations available through the mail or on-line; (c) afford isolated teachers in poor or rural districts access to comprehensive professional-development experiences; (d) allow teachers to complete professional development activities at convenient times; (e) permit teachers to review the information whenever needed; and (f) furnish teachers access to the best professional developers in the nation. The CD ROM programs will feature instruction by experienced teachers in classrooms. The programs will be tested by local teachers. Experimental teachers (Virtual Workshop) will receive the CD ROM program and will implement the instruction. Comparison teachers (Actual Workshop) will attend a live workshop and will implement the instruction. Primary measures will include teacher knowledge of the program, teacher implementation of lessons, and teacher development of materials. A multivariate approach with multiple measures on the same subjects will be used. A pretest-posttest comparison-group design will be used to determine the secondary effects of the teachers' use of CD ROM program on student knowledge of key concepts related to each of the routines taught. The purpose will be to demonstrate that the CD ROM program prod uses at least equivalent results to the live training format. In addition, social validity of the program will be assessed.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: This project will result in inexpensive, effective multi-media professional development materials to enable teachers to deliver complex content to academically diverse classes. The products that will result from this project will be commercially published and distributed by Edge Enterprises and PRO-ED and marketed to teachers, administrators, and others nationally at approximately $40 each. This type of professional development package is not currently available and is particularly needed by isolated teachers, preserve teachers, and inexperienced teachers interested in providing barrier-free insturction for all students in inclusive classes.",

Data analysis makes scientific concepts and processes concrete and gives students another way - besides memorization or analytical understanding - to learn quantitative science, often bypassing the need for advanced symbolic mathematics. This project will emphasize physics classes in high school and beyond, where labs are often cookbook demonstrations of phenomena and the data analysis mere verification. The first phase of this research, with the help of new technology, provided evidence those students understanding and competence could be improved beyond their previous capabilities. This project enhances that technology-Fathom Dynamic Statistics Software (KCP Technologies 2000) - to make it more useful in the science classroom, and it develops curriculum materials that use this software. Specifically, the firm will produce complete manuscripts for two supplemental books in physics appropriate for the high-school, AP, or college introductory course: a lab manual and a book of problem sets. In addition, Epistemological Engineering will begin to explore and prototype additional materials in physics, materials for other sciences, and staff development offerings. The proposed research will lead to significant enhancements to Fathom software and open the door to creating curriculum materials in science education using tools previously available only to math educators. Epistemological Engineering proffers technology that will contribute to strengthening science education in this country by teaching students to thoughtfully approach the world with a zest for measurement and prediction",

Phase I involved the design and fabrication of a prototype pre-concentration sampling instrument based on solid-phasemicroextraction (SPME). The design that was developed utilizes miniaturized components to achieve a compact, rugged sampling system that can be easily integrated into AUVs. In Phase II we will refine this design to a more compact, tightly integratedpreconcentrator, and develop an interface with an ion mobility spectrometer with capability for automated remote operation. Enhancement tasks are provided to integrate the preconcentrator/IMS into a REMUS UAV, and also to conduct initial field tests atWoods Hole. A Phase II/III bridge task provides fabrication and delivery to the Navy of a second generation preconcentrator/IMS instrument, including manuals and on-site training.BENEFITS: An underwater explosive analysis system will be particularlyadvantageous to the Navy because it will provide advanced warning to naval vessels of the presence of mines in the surrounding area, and also capabilities of tracing sources of UXO environmental contamina",

The in vitro models will provide an alternative to animal models for developing experimental protocols and assessing chronic electrode stability. They will allow long-term testing of electrochemical function and stability of electrodes under conditions that reflect the in vivo electrochemical environment without the expense and variability of conducting such testing in animals. The program focuses on electrodes for neural recording, functional electrical stimulation (FES), and chemical sensing in the central nervous system (CNS), although applications to electrodes in the periphery and to biostability of passive implants are anticipated. An inanimate model and a living model employing mouse progenitor cells are proposed. Both models are designed to mimic the compositional and diffusion environment of the CNS as it affects electrochemistry at an electrode. The inanimate model was developed in Phase I. The Phase II program will expand the model to include living cells. The validity of the inanimate and living models will be evaluated by comparison of electrode function in the in vitro models with that observed under identical test protocols in the chronic cat cortex.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In orbit, a satellite is exposed to solar radiation and to plasma, which has the effect of accumulation charge on the outer surface. On insulating surfaces in shadow, potentials of 18kV are measured, whereas the illuminated surfaces have potentials of zero. Such differences cause electrical discharge, resulting in; damage to the thermo-optical and mechanical properties of the satellite films, radio interference, and the onboard electrical equipment to switch logical states. Eikos Inc. proposes the use of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWnT) in LARC-developed polyimides as a novel transparent, electrostatic dissipation (ESD) films for spacecraft protection. This technology will provide environmentally stable and durable ESD films while protecting the surface from atomic oxygen (AO), Ultraviolet (UV) light by exploiting space proven polyimides. To the polyimide is added highly conductive SWnT to form interpenetrated network or nanocomposite, which is conductive, tough, and lightweight. The use of SWnT within this matrix to impart ESD protection offers a cost effective approach for a wide array of application and products. The applications include nanocomposite films for deployable structures, shielding, concentrators, and thermal barriers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional MRI is capable of achieving millimeter spatial resolution in measurements of blood oxygenation associated with neural tissue activation in the brain, while the EEG is capable of achieving sub-millisecond temporal resolution of the electrical activity. Many studies can now benefit from the synergy of these two techniques, but simultaneous recording is difficult at present. To fill this gap, we propose to design a prototype and test an integrated system that will make it easy to record EEG in an MRI scanner during fMRI acquisition. For studies not requiring simultaneous recording the system will be designed to carry out EEG studies as if they were done in the magnet for better comparison. In Phase I a 32-channel system was built and tested with a physical phantom to demonstrate feasibility. In Phase II a complete 256-channel system will be built to include integrated head stabilization, specialized head-coils, rapid and painless application of 256 EEG electrodes. ERP/fMRI experimental design and control software, joint EEG/fMRI segmentation and analysis software, and combined EEG/fMRI source modeling software. The Phase II system will be tested with a dual EEG/fMRI phantom as well as in human subjects with a visual perceptual experiment.",

This pathway is significantly less sensitive to ambient noise than communication systems used currently in extreme noiseenvironments. The communication system is called the Tooth Actuator Sensor or TAS Communication System. The novel components of the system are: (1)An intraoral battery powered transceiver capable of send and receive; (2) An actuator-sensor based on aninnovative design; (3) An extraoral transceiver capable of interfacing to a COTS two-way radio. The TAS should be capable of providing communication while on-the-run or under a wide variety of facemasks.\"",

Presently the only source for this plant are wild populations found at high elevations in the Rocky Mountains of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, Montana and Nevada. Due to the high demand for the mature root, the portion of the plant used for medicinal purposes, the species is being over-harvested. Creating sustainable agricultural sources for Ligusticum porteri is the key to averting future supply problems while maintaining the quantity of the commodity currently sold on the market. The focus on this research is to demonstrate the economic feasibility of L. porteri (Osha) as an alternative crop for production in high altitude areas of Wyoming and other areas in the Rocky Mountain West. The proposed Phase 2 research will include: 1) refining plant propagation studies using organic production methods to develop a supply of seedlings, 2) developing standards for growing the crop and monitoring its progress, 3) developing commercial pilot sites to implement and test the production standards, 4) estimating enterprise costs and profit margins based on data from the pilot sites, and 5) educating potential growers about this alternative agricultural product. The technical objectives of the research include: 1) Develop a stock of seedlings to be used for transplanting to various commercial test plots; 2) Successfully transfer plants from greenhouse to several outdoor locations; 3) Create inventory of seedlings and rootstock for production use at commercial test sites; 4) Develop written set of cultivation procedures for commercial producers to use in establishing seedling stock; 5) Develop commercial test site 1 at Elk Mountain, Wyoming (Carbon County); 6) Develop commercial test site 2 in Albany County, Wyoming; 7) Identify all enterprise costs associated in implementation of procedures standard and development of commercial test sites and prepare feasibility plan for this crop and 8) Develop program for educating potential growers on the opportunities for Osha as alternative production crop.",

It is anticipated that these metal oxide catalysts will readily ignite ionic monopropellants such as ammonium nitrate or hydroxyl ammonium nitrate (HAN) but will be thermally stable, resistant to sintering and loss of activity at high temperature and will be available at low cost. Incorporation of active metals into the crystal structure will result in high long life catalyst activity in part as a consequence of the high dispersion of these sites. Phase I will consist of the coarse screening of 18 - 24 catalysts representing a spectrum of compositions from a general composition anticipated to possess a refractory nature in addition to ignition activity. Identification of preferred variants will be followed by their optimization. Use in high specific impulse systems or long life thrusters is anticipated. These catalysts are expected to possess high activity not only for these ignitions, but also for catalytic combustion. Phase II would consist of extensive testing and optimization of preferred catalysts and application in model thrusters.",

To meet the need to prevent spacecraft charging, nano-crystallite coatings will be developed having over 1,000,000,000 field emitting particles per square cm. The field emitters will silently discharge electrostatic charge back into space. Mixed electron and ion conducting ceramic oxides, La(0.8)Sr(0.2)CoO(3-x) and La(0.8)Sr(0.2)MnO(3-x), will be ground into particles with median diameter less than 300 nm using proven techniques of ceramic and colloid science. Sharp edges and corners of the nano-particles will produce local fields in excess of 10 million V per meter which are sufficient for field electron emission. These refractory ceramic oxides will not be degraded by atomic oxygen of the space environment. Electron conducting properties of the oxides will neutralize differential charging of spacecraft. Slurries of suspended nano-particles will be developed which can simply be painted onto surfaces of materials requiring protection from electrostatic discharge.",

Coating production and the properties obtained are significant improvements over previous surface treatments for magnesium. In Phase I, over eighty experiments were conducted in the anodization of magnesium alloys and composites. Variables examined through these experiments include: voltage, electrolyte, temperature, magnesium alloy, cathode geometry, and time. Comparison of the coatings was conducted using microscopy, chemical analysis, and corrosion and wear tests. Four magnesium composites were obtained containing two different base alloys and four reinforcement phases (B4C, SiC, Al2O3, and carbon fiber). Anodization of two composites produced excellent coatings. The other two composites were shown to be incompatible with coating methods to resist corrosive environments. These results justify the goals of the project to identify appropriate magnesium composites and make them corrosion and wear resistant and eliminate from contention inappropriate materials. On completion of Phase II, the goals and objectives met will include a database will exist of known and tested anodized magnesium composites. The deliverables include anodized magnesium composite components produced and tested to NASA specifications for use in the reusable launch vehicle program.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65563            Composite electrical insulation systems for superconducting magnet coils used in fusion reactors typically include epoxy matrix materials.  These epoxy resins must exhibit excellent processing characteristics (low viscosity and long working life), mechanical and electrical strength, and radiation tolerance, including low radiation-induced gas evolution rates.  Historically, radiation resistant polymers have not exhibited suitable processing characteristics for fabrication of large magnet structures.  This project will develop, characterize, and demonstrate a new resin system for cryogenic radiation applications.  Phase I investigated diacetylene-siloxane polymeric systems for processing characteristics, radiation tolerance, and mechanical performance.  Several polymer compositions were prepared and evaluated to determine their radiation-induced gas evolution rate, processing characteristics, and composite mechanical performance.  Phase II will synthesize, characterize, and develop a new inorganic-organic polymeric system based on diacetylene-siloxanes for use in fabrication of glass fiber reinforced polymer matrix composites.  These composites are used as electrical insulators for superconducting magnet coils in fusion reactors.  The effects of radiation, including electron, gamma, and neutron exposures on composite properties will be evaluated.                      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Applications of the resin systems include electrical insulation for cyrogenic superconducting magnet systems (particularly those subjected to irradiation), cryogenic and high-temperature composite structures fabricated by liquid impregnation methods, automotive components and parts, aerospace equipment, and industrial belts and hoses",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this proposed program is to determine the viability of Raman spectrometry as an analytical tool for in-situ monitoring of aircraft engine oil condition. This objective will be accomplished by first characterizing unused engine oil with a high-performance bench-top Raman spectrometer, and optimizing the spectrometer variables and data processing steps. A correlation of Raman and Fourier-transform infra-red spectra will be performed as part of the band assignment process, followed by characterization of engine oil at various stages of degradation. After completion of the method development using the high-performance instrument, a portable fiber-optic Raman analyzer will be employed to study the oxidation of aircraft engine oil in-situ. It is anticipated that a Raman system using fiber-optic sampling, ion or diode laser excitation, a single monochromater, CCD detector, and a holographic notch filter will provide optimum sensitivity and sampling flexibility. Ideally, Raman spectrometry would replace other more cumbersome or time-consuming oil quality control and condition monitoring methodologies. However, at the very least it is anticipated that the inherent advantages of Raman spectrometry over other techniques can be employed to provide a simple, versatile, and portable unit for oil condition monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objectives of the Phase II program are to optimize the nitrate extraction/recovery process and to develop a bench-scale redox-recyclable nitrate removal system to be evaluated in water treatment, residential, and industrial settings. All of the basic concepts were proven in the Phase I program, and feasibility was demonstrated. It was shown that a redox-active extractant can be dissolved in a water-immiscible, non-volatile, non-flammable alternative solvent, where it can be electrochemically oxidized to activate it for effective liquid-liquid ion-exchange extraction. The extractant is then electrochemically reduced, allowing recovery of the target ion in a small volume. There are issues remaining to be addressed for full-scale commercial application, including stability of the extractant phase, purification of used extractant phases, analysis of the simulants after extractions to determine if anything is added to them, selection of preferred anion- and cation-exchange membranes, extraction of other target ions, and use of more complex simulants and actual groundwater. In this program, a working prototype apparatus suitable for Phase III field-trial evaluations will be completed. Specific research objectives of the Phase II program include: 1) Synthesize alternative solvents. 2) Determine/improve stability of the extractant. Recycling studies will be done, and it will be determined how many extraction cycles an extractant phase can go through and remain effective. If instability of the extractants is a problem, a more stable extractant will be synthesized. 3) Develop a method to purify spent extractant phases so they can be reused. The extractants will eventually break down, and other contaminants may enter extractant phases from aqueous phases. Chilling, heating, extraction, and precipitation will be evaluated to remove contaminants. 4) Extract from more complex aqueous simulants and actual groundwater samples. Study effects of competing anions and other species present in groundwater. 5) Evaluate system for extraction of other anions. 6) Analyze aqueous phases after extraction to see if anything goes into them from the extractant phase. 7) Design/build a prototype apparatus consisting of two electrochemical cells, one for oxidation and one for reduction (with concomitant recovery of the target ion) of the extractant. For extraction, a commercially available centrifugal contactor will be used. Anion- and cation-exchange membranes will be evaluated during oxidation and reduction of the extractant, and recovery of the target ion. This approach to ion-exchange eliminates a major drawback to current ion-exchange technology. Ion-exchange materials, whether resins or dissolved extractants used in liquid-liquid extraction, are regenerated by contact with large volumes of a high-salt, acidic, or basic strip solution, creating a large secondary waste stream in which the target ion is contained in low concentration. Electrochemical regeneration of the extractant allows recovery of the target ion in a small volume without creation of a large, new waste stream.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Ballast water discharge may contaminate receiving waters, creating an extremely pervasive problem in which control/mitigation after introduction is very expensive. Thus, prevention is paramount. This project will develop an automated, modular, pilot-scale add-on ballast treatment system based on the electrocatalytic onsite H2O2 solution generation technology demonstrated in Phase I. Phase II efforts will further refine the technology and its implementation, develop a prototype system capable of treating volumes sufficient for field testing, and further explore the effectiveness/applicability of the chemistry generated. This technology seeks to effectively and practically address the waterway biological/chemical contamination problem via vessel retrofitting while restricting cost, labor, and recordkeeping requirements as prescribed by the National Invasive Species Act of 1996. Eltron Research Inc.'s technology utilizes a novel electrolytic cell to produce environmentally gentle, noncorrosive sterilization/purification H2O2-containing solutions onsite with minimal consumable use. This advantageous technology produces the chemicals on demand at safe concentrations, thus avoiding major transportation and storage costs and considerations, and it readily allows automation. The technology: (1) employs modular hardware, allowing adaptation to specific contamination conditions and vessel sizes as well as simple and compact equipment; (2) requires less energy than ozone generation; and (3) is not overly affected by the system's turbidity or geometry. The chemistry produced is versatile and compatible (synergistically) with other candidate physical technologies, such as ultraviolet (UV) and ultrasonic irradiation or filtration. Additionally, it should be applicable to the treatment of other systems experiencing contamination, biofouling, and possibly scaling problems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This project will utilize photolithography and microfabrication in the assembly of a Cr(VI) monitoring device that is compact, portable, and cost effective. The proposed sensor will be a self-contained laboratory that samples, analyzes, and stores the results of onsite testing under a variety of sampling conditions. The device will rely on the pressure-driven introduction of aqueous samples that will be combined with a small, specific volume of electrolyte. Analyte streams of arbitrary ionic strength and composition will be sampled with minimal pretreatment. The use of a microelectrode array sensor chip will allow for increased sensitivity via enhanced diffusion of the analyte to the sensor element. In addition, use of a miniaturized detector will reduce solution waste during testing. Eltron Research, Inc.'s proposed electrochemical detection scheme allows for the use of simple, inexpensive instrumentation that is capable of the remote monitoring of groundwater and surface waters for Cr contamination. Phase II will focus on the optimization of the proposed Cr(VI) sensor in addition to the assembly and design of a prototype unit for field analysis of groundwater and surface waters using minimal analyte and supporting electrolyte. In Phase I, Eltron Research Inc., successfully demonstrated that self-assembled monolayer (SAM) modified microelectrode arrays could be used for the electrochemical detection of Cr(VI) in aqueous solutions. Cr(VI) solutions with concentrations varying from 0.1 ppb to 100 ppb could be detected using a sensitive electrochemical method. Using photolithography, a robust microelectrode array was fabricated and incorporated into a microfluidic flow cell for Cr(VI) detection. Furthermore, this flow cell was successfully coupled to a peristaltic pump to introduce analyte and supporting electrolyte for Cr(VI) detection, and was interfaced to benchtop electrochemical instrumentation (a potentiostat) for potential use in long-term monitoring situations. The performance of the miniaturized Cr(VI) detector was studied as a function of such variables as pH, supporting electrolyte concentration, SAM deposition time, Cr(VI) exposure time, electrolyte type, and Cr(VI) concentration. The electrochemical detection of Cr(VI) in water is a cost-effective method for long-term, remote monitoring of suspected environmental contamination sites. This approach could find general use in both specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency applications and those of the private sector; for example, the monitoring of Cr waste in the electroplating industry. Other industries requiring wastewater monitoring for hexavalent chromium include metal processing, galvanic plants, tanneries, wood preservation, chemical manufacturing, aerospace, and electronics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65041     Microphonic excitation in superconducting radio frequency (RF) structures causes a shift in the resonant frequency, making the structures less effective in transferring the RF energy into kinetic energy of the particles.  As a result, a larger RF power source and a larger helium refrigerator are needed, increasing capital costs and reducing overall reliability.  This project will develop an active microphonics damping system based on magnetic smart material actuators and high speed digital signal processing.  These actuators will be designed to operate efficiently at cryogenic temperatures.  In Phase I, the requirements of a microphonics control system were obtained through discussions with engineers at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, the National Superconducting Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, and the Spallation Neutron Source, and a prototype actuator was built and tested.  The tests demonstrated the feasibility of using magnetostrictive materials for cavity tuning: satisfactory load handling capacity, magnetostriction, and response time were shown.  Phase II, will develop a working tuner, install it on a superconducting RF cavity, measure its performance characteristics and sensitivity, and develop a comprehensive design for a control system.                             Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Active vibration control is a serious problem in a wide range of applications.  The low frequency and high amplitude damping capability should have applicability to semiconductor processing equipment and other sensitive instrumentation such as electron or tunneling microscopes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65050       To achieve a high degree of interaction between the positron and electron beams in the Next Linear Collider (NLC), the interacting beams must be aligned to within 1 nanometer.  Low frequency vibrations from auxiliary equipment and from local ground vibration cause relative motion of the two beams and therefore must be dampened.  Furthermore, longer-term ground motion requires periodic realignment of the beams through larger scale magnet movement.  This project will develop a high force, active vibration damping system based on magnetic smart material actuators.  The system consists of motion sensors, a high speed digital signal processor, and high force actuators based on magnetic smart materials.  Phase I developed and demonstrated a reaction mass vibration control system, developed an innovative control algorithm, and characterized actuator motion sensors with the potential to achieve the nanometer stability required for the NLC.  Active vibrational damping of the final focus magnets was achieved without requiring a physical connection from the magnets to ground because very little space is available for the installation of support structures.  Phase II will develop and identify an advanced control algorithm, a cryogenic magnetostrictive actuator, a low noise power amplifier, along with high speed digital signal processors and motion sensors, to achieve stability at the 1nm level required for the NLC.

The method was proven through implementation in C++ toolkit form and integration with an OpenGL-based viewer. During the Phase II effort, we will 1) refine and extend the existing algorithms and language, 2) add support for vision-based feedback, 3) add support for acceleration control, 4) add support for force control, 5) add algorithms for collision reasoning about rigid, flexible, and movable objects, 6) include simulation capability as part of the control algorithm, 7) enhance the demonstration viewer and integrate a GUI for editing, viewing, and exchanging velocity control systems, 8) add grasping support, and 9) add support for floating-base manipulators.

This project will construct, test, and document a full scale, operational, whole-tree harvester.  In Phase I, the automatic control system was designed, tested, and documented for three key functions of the whole tree harvester:  the track steering system, the tree accumulator system, and the endgate mechanism.  Mockups of portions of each of these systems were built and interfaced with a programmable logic controller ported to a personal computer for programming, simulating, and testing the control functions required of each subsystem.  Phase II will focus on procuring and fabricating the remaining components, assembling key subsystems (such as the tracks, the steering system, the engine and system controls), and testing the prototype whole tree harvester in the field on one of more plots of farm-grown trees.  The ability of the whole tree harvester to rapidly negotiate typical farm fields, cut and accumulate trees at high speed, load trees automatically (in both batch and continuous mode), and be successfully transported between fields will be tested and documented.           Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The whole-tree harvester should increase the productivity of harvesting trees by 5 times or more and could be used to harvest trees grown on farmland as efficiently as any other agricultural crop.  The productivity gains should significantly improve the economics of biomass energy production and also have application to the pulp and paper industry.",

Supporting objectives to be achieved during Phase II are to: 1. Complete the characterization of the pure, methyl bromide degrading microorganisms obtained in Phase I and select the best strains to be used in biotrickling filters. 2. Design, construct and test a new load-dampening system (laboratory-scale). 3. Design and construct a mobile pilot-scale biotrickling filter (including the load dampening system) for field demonstrations of effective methyl bromide treatment. 4. Demonstrate sustained and effective methyl bromide treatment at least at one quarantine fumigation facility, and at least one field fumigation. For the latter, this will include demonstration of a new collection system (two-layer tarp) to improve capture of methyl bromide from soil fumigations. 5. Develop a mathematical model of the load dampening-biotrickling filtration system to be used for system scale-up, system sizing, and for cost evaluation. 6.

We propose heat sinks based on innovative wicks and fiber heat exchangers that enable high thermal effectiveness in a lightweight compact package that can be dedicated to individual components. Phase 1 will analyze the concept, survey materials candidates, identify applications requirements, and fabricate test articles to acquire performance data for a range of heat fluxes and total energy. Vaporizing heat sink tests will be performed in vacuum at different gravity orientations. Phase 2 would further develop the concept, designs, and materials, leading to a prototype heat sink for a selected NASA application, such as cooling of a battery or electronics box.",

That is the message from the entirety of the technical literature regarding solar magnetic disturbances (SMD) and electromagnetic pulse (EMP).  These phenomena produce a quasi-DC current in the earth that enters the powertransmission system via ground-induced currents (GIC).  This current saturates power transformers and produces a host of undesirable results leading up to, and including, complete system collapse.During Phase I, Engineering Matters has advanced three innovative solutions to this vexing problem.  Two of these solutions are based upon switch-mode power supply principles driving currents in the neutral lead, and the third solution consists of magneticcancellation in the transformer core, i.e., instead of current cancellation, this is direct field cancellation.  All solutions are focused on eliminating the magnetic saturation of the transformer.  These solutions will be demonstrated on a 120 VACsingle-phase basis during Phase I.The Phase II work effort will consist of extending the design, analysis, and testing of the Phase I work to a three-phase 14 kV system with autotransformers.  The extension will increase the system operating voltage; test the solutions in the field,including the E3 environment; perform a manufacturing cost reduction analysis, and optimize the design of each of the solutions.\"",

The goal is to establish MPW as a reliable and economic method to weld tubular structures. The project will conduct research and engineering that will address the critical technical hurdles for the commercial implementation and dissemination of the new welding technology. The commercial applications would revolutionize the assembly process of the hydroformed tubular structures in automotive chassis and space frame applications. This process will promote the hybrid automotive body structure design that uses tubes of both aluminums and steels and will enable joining of different materials such as titanium to superalloys for aerospace and electronic applications.",

Accurately described real fluid properties will be employed in an integrated simulation tool, that involves thermodynamics and fluid dynamics models, to describe local vaporization phenomena in liquid rocket engine propellant delivery systems, propellant tanks and the test facilities. Bubbly flows will be simulated with a homogeneous or heterogeneous mixture model, which emphasizes the computational efficiency and modeling effectiveness. Cavitating venturi meter and pump flows, cryogenic propellant tank filling processes and evaporating cooling jets can be analyzed with this methodology. More accurate propellant metering, oscillatory inlet flow characterization and accurate description of the thermodynamics environment of cryogenic fluid systems will be the result of this project. Other complex flows in propellant delivery systems or coolant flows in test facilities will also be amenable to analysis with the produced methodology.",

All of the currently available positive inotropic agents have significant adverse effects with digitalis being the only orally available positive inotrope. ATP causes a pronounced positive inotropic effect. Receptors for ATP, known as P2 purinergic receptor, has been shown to mediate its positive inotropic effect. However, agonists acting at this cardiac P2 receptor with enhanced efficacy, potency and selectivity, are lacking. Preliminary data suggest that certain specific modifications of the AMP molecule will confer positive inotropic activity and selectivity vs. the vascular P2 receptor. Adult rat ventricular myocytes and intact heart model have been developed to determine the affinity and efficacy of new agents at the myocyte P2 receptor and their effects on the various functional parameters in the intact heart. The overall objective of the study is to use these cardiac models to test these specifically modified AMP molecules at the cardiac P2 receptor. New chemical structures will be correlated with the affinity and the positive inotropic activity and cardiac vs. vascular P2 receptor selectivity. The effects of these compounds on the heart rate and blood pressure in conscious rats will also be determined. The studies may lead to potentially useful new positive inotropic agents for the treatment of heart failure.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Ension, Inc. and its development partner, the University of Pittsburgh, have developed and patented an active mixing membrane oxygenator (AMMO), which has been proven to be highly efficient in terms of oxygenation and decarbonation (5-8 times that of oxygenators currently in use), capable of pumping blood and atraumatic to blood. The AMMO achieves its efficiency by rotating flow-through discs of microporous hollow fiber membranes, which are mounted on a double lumen shaft, through blood significantly minimizing fluid phase resistance. In vitro and in vivo data have been collected to substantiate our claims of highly efficient mass transfer and blood pumping with minimal blood damage. Our proposed Phase II plan includes refinement of current AMMO designs to provide at least 7.0 Lpm of blood flow and adequate gas transfer, oxygen transfer of 400 ml/min and carbon dioxide transfer of 250 ml/min, in a device with 0.5 sq. m. fiber surface area. These capabilities should be sufficient to support adult patients during open-heart surgery. Fabrication methods will be moved from the development laboratory to a semi-automated manufacturing process that will enable the production of high quality devices in numbers adequate to support full evaluation per MMI standards. In vivo testing in calves (12 per year) will commence with acute testing of improved devices and move to experiments that follow current FDA guidelines. Finally, it is proposed that 6 animal experiments in Yr. 02 be conducted on our final prototype and this data, in addition to that generated in the Phase III development, be submitted to the FDA to support our claim of device readiness for a human clinical trial.",

The proposed biomechanical OWS must meet theU.S. Navy's requirements for discharge limits below 5 ppm, flowrates up to 10 GPM, and minimal crew interaction.  EnSolve willconstruct an OWS based on the Phase I Option design that willmeet the pre-stated goals.  The system will be fully automated,allowing 30 days of hands-free operation, and it will bethoroughly tested with actual shipboard bilgewater and shipboardchemicals.  The system will effectively remove free-phase oils,and the biological chamber will consume the emulsifiedhydrocarbons and target organic chemicals.BENEFITS: The biomechanical OWS will reliably treat emulsified bilgewater, and will require minimal crew interface.  OWS equipment meeting the U.S. Navy goals can be deployed across multiple platforms, addressing aneed in the commercial sector estimated to exceed $1 Billion.  In addition, a biomechanical separator can destroy many environmentally harmful organic materials that would pass untreated through a conventional separator.\"",

In phase I, we investigated the properties of this amazing new material and concluded the original premise was substantially correct, although some details remain to be investigated and a whole new suite of tools and machinery are required. In Phase II, we are proposing to advance this technology to the point of winding a nanotube magnet coil, testing it and delivering it to NASA/MSFC. The main thrusts of the program include some more definitive measurements of superconducting properties as a function of temperature, magnetic field and mechanical strain. In parallel efforts, tools will be developed to wind the carbon nanotube coils, attach electrical leads to them and test their performance. We will update the conceptual design for a NASA magnet for an MHD disk generator using carbon nanotube conductors and perform sufficient economic analyses to determine the economic feasibility of this application of carbon nanotubes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will demonstrate using a prototype design the commercial feasibility of electrospinning to produce nanofibers. Nanofibers will be combined with conventional filter media to form a novel NanoFilter media for liquid and air filtration applications. These applications have been shown to remove particles smaller than 3 microns from effluent streams with superior filtering efficiency and attractive cost potential. The acrylic nanofibers will be electrospun as a nanoweb directly on to a conventional support (filter media) substrate. The web will be combined with a protective cover layer to form a sandwich structure, which will be collected as a roll. The filter will be easily tailored to achieve the desired composite filter performance by varying architecture: substrates, nanofiber diameter, nanoweb density, and the nanoweb thickness. This project will be carried out collaboratively with academic centers and major corporations as its strategic partners. Nanotechnologies developed in the coming years will form the foundation for a significant commercial platform. Commercial applications in a variety of filtration processes such as: high-end industrial raw material purification, biological separations, ultra pure air and water systems, hospital clean rooms, agriculture and food industries filters, and microelectronic industries next generation clean environment needs are anticipated.",

Current manufacturing techniques, namely the ETREMA Crystal Growth (ECG) process, yield polycrystalline materials with a preferential crystal orientation of <112> along the rod axis, but little to no long range order amongst the individualdendrites.  While this structure provides for large strains as compared to alternate materials, increases of 20-30% in the strain output of TERFENOL-D can be realized if the rod was fully aligned, not only along the <112>, but also with each of thecrystalline dendrites aligned parallel to one another.  Phase I successfully showed that improvements to the microstructure and final magnetostrictive performance could be achieved by altering the thermal environment during solidification.  The proposedPhase II effort is a series of experiments to define the specific process variables identified in Phase I.  Once proven effective, the Phase II Option will perform the commercialization of this technology improvement by developing the necessarywork-instructions that will allow the new process to be readily inserted into the day-to-day manufacturing of TERFENOL-D.\"",

Conventional alkylation processes require large volumes of corrosive liquid acids, which can inflict serious injury via skin contact or inhalation. The new alkylation process will be fundamentally safer and cleaner, reducing the use and generation of toxic chemicals. It uses a first-of-a-kind engineered zeolite catalyst that is environmentally benign and eliminates the risks associated with liquid acids while producing alkylate of comparable quality. The new catalyst promises significantly improved yields and selectivities, minimizing waste by-products and disposal problems associated with liquid acids. The engineered zeolite catalysts can be used most effectively for liquid phase alkylations of paraffins and aromatics, such as the production of high-octane alkylate, and industrially important petrochemicals such as cumene and ethylbenzene",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) are now accepted as a powerful and general graphical language for designing complex systems. Several CPN editors, including Modasco's VSO Design, are now available or in development. However, these tools do not restrict the modelarchitect to realistic designs that satisfy the system's physical and functional requirements. Recent investigations by Modasco indicate that VSO Design can perform model architecture verification and validation during the design phase, insuring that themodels it generates satisfy the system requirements. The architectural building blocks (entities) of a system can be identified and stored in a database along with rules describing how these entities can be associated. The proposed verification andvalidation tool restricts alternative CPN designs to the predefined entity set and the entity associations. Additionally, designers can create a validated model and store it as a special entity type for later reuse. This is the first step to developing atrue Collaborative Virtual Prototyping environment allowing multiple users, working remotely, to build validated subsystem models that can be assembled into larger, more complex systems.  An important and timely application of this technology is themodeling and evaluation of evacuation plans as a part of an overall Homeland Defense strategy.\"",

Clearly, there is a need for a suite of sensors capable of acquiring transientmeasurements in high-temperature, gas turbine environments at discrete points.   Luna Innovations proposes to develop a fiber optic-based temperature, pressure, skin friction suite capable of acquiring transient point measurements in high temperature,propulsive environments.

The operating principle of the probeswill be based on proven Extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometric (EFPI) techniques.

Rotational molding of liquid crystal polymer (LCP) resins was successfully demonstrated in the Phase I program, and the proposed Phase II effort will continue development of this process. LCP materials are of interest in application to cryogenic propellant storage because of their low permeability, low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), excellent strength, and chemical inertness. Development of rotationally molded LCP articles addresses the aerospace industry's need for lightweight, low-cost liners for use in propellant storage tanks and transport lines in space vehicles.

Inaddition, the manufacturing methods for the polymer devices we have developed (spin, dip or spray coating) lend themselves to low-cost volume manufacturing without the need for high vacuum systems.  In the proposed Phase II program, the successful resultsof the Phase I program will serve as the basis for the development of a new class of microwave components.

The work is based on the Phase I feasibility studies which generated two approaches for producing OFDR targeted laser systems. These systems have the unique combination of rapid tuning and immunity to mode hops. The proposed designs have reduced alignment tolerances and built in wavelength tracking. These features provide a level of hardening to environmental influences that will make flight qualification of the systems possible as well as cost effective.

A Distributed Grating Demodulation System (DGDS) was constructed and tested using radiation-resistant fiber. Temperatue sensors were produced and calibrated. Two housings were constructed that allow an all-welded pressure boundary penetration. Radiation testing was successfully conducted on sensing fiber in a combined high-neutron and gamma environment. The key technological advantage offered by the sensors developed under this program is their ability to be highly multiplexed, allowing the placement of literally thousands of sensors along a single optical fiber. There are three strategic objectives for the Phase II: 1) Fully validate the DGDS technology for space reactor applications, 2) Expand the application base for DGDS sensor technology, and 3) Develop strategy for commercial development. The primary objective is to finalize sensor designs using specifications obtained from NASA and industry partners so that prototypes can be constructed. Resolving high temperature operation is a major portion of this objective. The application base will be expanded by designing sensors that can measure temperature, strain, pressure, and flow. Luna has an extremely successful track record in commercial development, having spun off four successful companies dedicated to the commercialization of technologies developed at Luna Innovations.",

The new transformer operates under resonant conditions with a very high mechanical factor. Consequently, the transformer can achieve a higher step-up ratios and higher power density compared to similar conventional magnetic transformers. The novel transformer is compact in size, light in weight, and does not generate magnetic interferences, since neither magnetic materials nor coils are involved in its manufacturing. Additionally, the specific design proposed for Phase I, based on a new paralleling-tapped concept developed by Face, allows for the supply of a different number of high voltages and high powers required to drive the TWT.The Phase II proposal is focused on the technical improvement of the proposed device in order to achieve the performance levels required for low and medium power TWTs. In order to achieve this goal the following objectives will be pursued: (a) increase power output of current design up to 100W, (b) electronic integration for space application, and (c) reliability testing for the final equipment.",

Specifically, a Faradaic Prediction Tool will be developed, to predict theperformance of a corrosion protection system for aging aircraft components, and the onset and propagation of corrosion resulting from coating degradation. The Faradaic Prediction Tool will predict the coating performance over time at the next basedeployment, using a database including  electrochemical and environmental severity data. The Faradaic Prediction Tool could also be used to downselect new coating formulations, for more rigorous testing. In the Phase II program, we will a) performlaboratory, field and accelerated weathering tests to simulate coating degradation and corrosion damage on aluminum panels, b) develop algorithms for predicting electrochemical impedance spectra for coatings, using data mining tools, c) developmethodologies for predicting fundamental electrochemical parameters, d) combine these approaches into a methodology for predicting coating failure and corrosion damage as a function of time, and e) verify the methodology with long term experimental data.In Phase III, we will package the Faradaic Prediction Tool into a user-friendly software program for commercialization.\"",

This project will develop a multi-element, microelectrode array technology to resolve small-length-scale chemical and electrochemical processes involved in localized corrosion of metallic alloy systems.  The arrays formed will be simulated heterogeneous microstructures with length scales relevant to corrosion in real alloy systems, capable of mapping potential, pH, and current distributions associated with passive or actively corroding surfaces.  In Phase I, (1) A1-2024 microelectrode wires with diameters less than 6 m were chemically milled, (2) Al-2024, Pt, and Ag microelectrode wires were fabricated into linear arrays with length scales 10-1000 m, (3) the arrays were tested in corrosion environments, and (4) the data was compared to that obtained using state-of-the-art corrosion test methods.  Phase II will (1) extend the approach to other engineering alloys of interest, (2) refine the chemical milling process and examine alternatives such as electrochemical milling, (3) design the arrays based on the results of mathematical modeling of electrochemical variations across surfaces, (4) refine the approach for fabrication of the arrays using the microelectrode wires, (5) test the microelectrode arrays in simulated corrosion environments, and (6) compare the corrosion data to that obtained by state-of-the-art methods.

The specific Phase II objectives are: 1. Scale-up and demonstration of the electrically mediated process on eight inch wafers, 2. Development of a process library for feature sizes 1-5 down to 0.17 microns, and lower, and 3. Design of a \"proof of concept\" plating tool. Preliminary concept design of a plating tool incorporating the electrically mediated process will be performed by an outside firm. The sustainable competitive advantage associated with the project for leveling is cost. Minimal overplate will eliminate or minimize the need for chemical/mechanical planarization (CMP) by reducing the copper waste slurry compared to the state-of-the-art copper metallization processes. This in turn would eliminate the associated control, environmental, and cost issues",

The challenge is to deploy a lightweight UWB antenna that is stowable in a smallvolume, that is automatically deployable, and that will be resistant to the harsh space environment. To overcome these challenges we propose an Ultra-Compact Impulse Radiating Antenna (IRA) that is lightweight and is automatically deployed into the shapeof an umbrella. We will implement this by using a telescoping center support rod and Z-folded ribs. We will also incorporate an automated deployment mechanism that will allow the antenna to be opened automatically. The harsh space environment will requirethe use of materials that are resistant to high ambient radiation levels and high temperature gradients. For this reason we are teamed with Physitron, Inc., because of their background in materials for space applications. During Phase II we will develop anUltra-Compact, Impulse Radiating Antenna (IRA) with a deployed diameter of around four feet. We will explore both focused and defocused designs, in order to tailor the beamwidth to a variety of applications. We will use materials that are resistant to theradiation and temperature gradients of the space environment.

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"On the modern electronic battlefield, a weapon that disables the enemy's electronics can be more useful than a weapon that executes a killing strike. This is possible because a radio frequency (RF) weapon that attacks electronics can be effective over amuch larger radius than a high-explosive (HE) weapon. For example, a single 155-mm artillery shell has a disabling blast radius limited to a few meters for armored vehicles, while an RF weapon detonated at 500 meters above the battlefield can have aneffective radius in excess of 100 meters. Until recently, it was not feasible to incorporate RF weapons into munitions, due to the large size of the available sources and antennas. But compact sources are becoming available, and a compact antenna can bederived from the Collapsible Impulse Radiating Antenna (CIRA), which is an umbrella-like antenna that is already being sold commercially by Farr Research. The antenna must satisfy requirements for radiating a broad band of frequencies, and it must be smallenough to fit within a typical munition. The proposed antenna design is a combination of a parachute and an Impulse Radiating Antenna, and it is called a Para-IRA. With this antenna, and in combination with a compact Marx generator, one can deploy an RFweapon from a height of 500 meters and radiate a sufficiently high field on the ground to cause electronic upset over a radius of 100 meters.

One of the key pieces of technology used by FT is a developed constraint -based reasoning system that ties the various types of informationtogether.  A major technological advancement that will be provided by this tool is the ability to provide a coordinated view of a wide variety of heterogeneous geospatial data.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The sheer quantity of data available to scientists via the Internet is staggering, and more is being collected, aggregated and processed daily. Unfortunately, this data is scattered in collections throughout the network, stored in a variety of formats, and accessible via many different types of programs. NASA is a primary producer of scientific data, as well as an important consumer of such data, and thus developing systems to help scientists access, integrate and process large volumes of heterogeneous data is clearly in NASA's interest. Theseus is a commercial high-performance plan execution system that we have developed for integrating web-based data. We propose to extend the Theseus architecture to create a practical system that will make it easy for earth scientists to access, stage, integrate and process large volumes of scientific data distributed over the Internet. Theseus employs a dataflow architecture for plan execution, which we can leverage to create an innovative, scalable approach for processing distributed scientific data. The resulting system will be used as part of a collaborative ongoing effort with scientists from NASA Ames and University of Montana who are applying AI planning technology to ?Biospheric NowCasting? -- real-time ecosystem modeling from Earth Science data.",

An advanced neutron interrogation system for the non-destructive assay of these wastes can provide reliable information in a high-radiation environment.  Therefore, this project will develop an advanced neutron generator that meets the demanding requirements for the analysis of transuranic waste, as well as wastes containing organic materials and materials of importance under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  Phase I (1) demonstrated the technical feasibility of operating the proposed pulsed neutron generator with the parameters required for remotely-handled waste certification; (2) designed an engineering prototype pulsed neutron generator system suitable for nuclear waste certification; and (3) provided the preliminary design for a complete non-destructive assay system that can be used to demonstrate the new technology in a real-world environment.  Phase II will complete the development and demonstrate a new low-energy neutron generator with greatly enhanced measurement capabilities for remotely handled waste.  The measurement system will be life-tested and optimized, and final demonstrations will be performed at the remotely-handled waste facility at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.                    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The advanced neutron generator should form a foundation for reliable certification for remotely-handled nuclear waste.  Areas of applications include clean-up of Department of Energy facilities, waste handling organizations in other countries, industrial process control, and mine detection",

AVSIS is a grating-type hyperspectral scanner using all solid-state Silicon/InGaAs sensors via a common slit imaging approach. By simultaneously imaging Earth surface and acquiring downwelling irradiance or reference radiance via switching fiber optics, Earth surface spectral reflectance or radiance is measured. With platform positioning, attitude, and altitude measurements, its data cube is precisely geo-referenced. AVSIS has a spectral resolution better than 5nm with a swath width better than 320 pixels and quantization resolution better than 10-bits. AVSIS is tightly integrated. A tightened airborne computer (weighing 20LBs) is developed to interface and power its imaging components, positioning/attitude/altitude measurement sensors, and radio-link. The power and interconnection circuits for AVSIS attachments are build-ins of the compact computer. Seamless real-time operation is implemented by intuitive graphic user interface or system automation.AVSIS achieves great expandability with its modularization and network design. AVSIS can be operated alone or as a networked node with other supplementary nodes in an imaging cluster, which includes Flight Landata?s high-resolution multispectral/photographic imaging nodes, and a future fluorescence lidar for thematic airborne remote sensing.",

However, in both developing countries and developed countries adequate expertise is often limited. Furthermore, this method is quite time-consuming. Flow Inc. has developed a product called the OptiMALr assay, which is an immunochromatographic test that can be used for routine malaria diagnosis without the need for an expert user or a sophisticated laboratory. This product has been successfully manufactured and masold via a commercial partnership with a larger firm. The current assay, however, has short-commings that must be surmounted to make an even more effective test. The test needs to be able to speciate all forms of human malaria species. Furthermore, it should be packaged in an individual cassette-based format to help with stability problems and make it easier to use. Finally, the test should be optimized to be more sensitive to detect very low levels of parasites in infected patients blood. The work described here will allow the development of a new test prototype that embodies these needed improvements.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Description (provided by applicant): High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU)        phased arrays allow flexibility in beam steering, beam shaping, and dynamic          focusing. These features enable them to create large and contiguous tissue           lesions of predetermined shape with high efficiency, resulting in shorter            treatments, increased accuracy, and ease of operation. The goal of this              proposal is to replace the current Sonablate HIFU transducers (mechanically          scanned, dual-element, HIFU and imaging capability) used in the clinic for the       treatment of BPH and localized prostate cancer with a 2-D HIFU phased array.         The array will eliminate \"probe switching\" during treatment, reduce the              reliance on mechanical scanning, and increase treatment effectiveness through        dynamic focusing and focal zone shaping. During Phase I, phased array                configurations were simulated to determine an optimum design for HIFU prostate       treatments. A 1-D truncated spherical annular array and electronics were             fabricated and characterized. In this Phase II application, we propose to build      on these encouraging results by: 1) defining and optimizing a HIFU phased array      with 2-D focusing capability, 2) fabricating and characterizing the array, 3)        integrating it into a transrectal image-guided HIFU probe to be used with the        Sonablate system, and 4) evaluating its performance in-vitro and in-vivo using       a canine prostate model.                                                             PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  As our population ages, prostate disease (BPH & cancer) is becoming an ever-more-frequent  malady for man.  The annual market for treatment of prostate cancer in the U.S. is estimated  around $5 billion.  Focus Surgery Inc. manufactures the Sonablate(TM) system, which makes   use of HIFU technology to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  To extend the application of  this system to treat localized prostate cancer increased flexibility in focal spot placement and  less reliance on mechanical steering is required.  The current proposal directly addresses this   challenge.  Successful completion of this project will open the enormous market of prostate  cancer treatment to our Sonablate(TM) device.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Fort Environmental Laboratories, Inc.'s Phase I research project resulted in the development and standardization of an assay that tests substances that might disturb reproductive and developmental processes in animals by interfering with the endocrine system. The primary goal of the proposed research was to validate and commercialize the Xenopus laevis oocyte maturation germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) model as a system for the rapid evaluation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) found in the workplace or the environment. Specifically, a 24-hour X. laevis assay modified from the original work of Pickford and Morris (Environmental Health Perspectives 1999;107(4):285-292) and Lui and Patino (Biology of Reproduction 1993;49:980-988) designed to evaluate progestin-active or anti-progestin EDCs in vitro was standardized and evaluated by conducting a preliminary validation study with a series of known EDCs, compounds found to be inactive, and chemicals with unknown activity. The relative inhibitory potential of the toxicants study was ethinyl estradiol>>Aroclor 1260>atrazine>dieldrin. Testosterone and the confined animal feed operation (CAFO) waste complex mixture sample had a stimulatory effect on GVBD. Bisphenol A had no effect on GVBD, even at concentrations of 5,000 M. The binding capacity of the toxicants to the oocyte membrane plasma receptor (OMPR) relative to progesterone was low. Interestingly, testosterone possessed some binding capacity to the OMPR, indicating that the OMPR may be a more precocious binding site than originally anticipated. However, the relative binding affinity of the toxicants to the OMPR was expressed as progesterone>>ethinyl estradiol (-)>testosterone (+)>atrazine (-)>Aroclor 1260 (-) >dieldrin (-)>CAFO sample (+)>bisphenol A (NE). The washout studies indicated that although the competitive binding affinity of ethinyl estradiol for the OMPR was the greatest of the test compounds evaluated in the present study, testosterone, dieldrin, and Aroclor 1260 were bound more tightly to the OMPR than ethinyl estradiol. Because none of the currently developed high throughput EDC screening systems are capable of specifically screening for progesterone-active EDCs, the successful completion of the in vitro oocyte GVBD model development will provide the scientific community with a non-mammalian, cost-effective, rapid, and reliable method of screening EDCs. The ability to rapidly and cost-effectively screen for and evaluate the mechanisms of EDCs is an attractive alternative to the current laborious and expensive testing systems used today. Increasing concerns over the widespread finding of EDCs in the environment have dramatically increased the need for standardized assays, such as the X. laevis GVBD model, because few other progestin/antiprogestin-based in vitro assays are available today.",

The U.S. Army has reported many instances of significant loss of blood products from storage bag breakage.  Freeze-dried blood products provide an alternative to cryopreservation.  The lyophilization ofplatelets and red blood cells on the laboratory level has recently been demonstrated.  Industrial scale preservation of the products, preferably in storage bags, has yet to be established.  During the Phase I program, breathable film materials showed highwater vapor permeation rates (4,200 to 277,000 g/m2/day).  These materials were made of FDA approved polymers.  Freeze-drying bovine serum albumin and a test cell line showed a significant reduction in the duration of the lyophilization cycle.  Therecovery of cells was 25 percent higher than in lyo-vials.The Phase II activity will result in the manufacture of prototype storage bags and the optimization of the lyophilization process.  Product shelf stability will be evaluated and in vitro and clinical tests of the products will be carried out.Foster-Miller will team with a current United States producer of pharamaceutical containers including blood storage bags and with a firm with extensive expertise in the lyophilization of biological materials to facilitate commercialization of the two-bagblood products lyophilization system.

This proposal seeksto expand this work and also explore another novel packaging concept tointegrate antenna  radiators and feed lines onto fabric using a commontextile joining technology.  This packaging concept will enable thefabrication of integrated patch antennas and the incorporation offlexible electronic circuits as well.  The resulting hybrid textile isflexible, low profile, environmentally rugged, and can be applied toexisting soldier systems garments or load bearing systems. (P-01596)\"",

Aircraft seats can significantly contribute to the safety of the passengers by restraining them and providing protection in the event of crashes. An innovative transport aircraft passenger seat concept for superior occupant protection, meeting all structural requirements used in typical seat designs was developed in the Phase I program. This was accomplished with the use of new energy-absorbing structural members and precise control of seat deformation characteristics. Foster-Miller developed an innovative design using the integrated advanced dynamic finite element modeling technique for the seat, occupants, restraints and energy absorbing elements. Results from certification tests on an existing seat design were used to validate the analytical model. The Phase II program will focus on the optimization and detailed design of this new aircraft seat, including the injury-reduction features. Testing and verification of designs based on the new approach will be conducted. Manufacturing issues and costs will be also addressed. The design will conform to the SAE certification standards for aircraft passenger seats. (P-020417)",

Family access to clinical and administrative information is essential to effectively participate with care, yet it is usually not available, or is inadequate. Channels of communication between families and facility caregivers are poorly defined. \r \r The proposed Phase Il study will complete a curriculum of clinical, administrative, and legal education for families of nursing home residents in an interactive video format accessible through the Web. It will include a \"family orientation\" for newly admitted residents, and in addition, a facility-specific \"Family Communication Room\" will enable families and staff to communicate directly on an ongoing basis. A 12-month randomized trial with four facilities will assess family satisfaction, involvement and complaints as well as resident quality of care and quality of life. \r \r The Phase I study successfully completed all stated objectives. Approximately 45-minutes of interactive-video family education on dementia was created in conjunction with family advisors. Eighteen family members who completed the program showed enhanced knowledge on pre-post tests (t = 5.9, p<0.0001) and reported high levels of satisfaction. The Phase I family advisors were essential to the development of this Phase II proposal. \r \r Building on the successful commercialization of a previous product for nursing home staff education, there is a well-defined commercialization plan. Discussions have begun to market this product with a major insurance underwriter servicing the Iong-term care industry.",

Development of a lighter weight binder with a suitable morphology, combined with environmentally friendly solvents to produce RAMs would offer significantadvantages in manufacturing and in the field. As in any functional filled polymer, interaction between the different components is a must. The presence of inactive materials or induced porosity lessens the overall efficacy. In other words, a functionalblend, preferably an interpenetrating network would be the ideal material. Fractal Systems, in collaboration with our aerospace partners, proposes to continue optimization of the resin formulations by manipulation of the polymeric binder and the modifiedRAM filler. This effort will take the successes achieved in Phase I, based on functionalization of the components, from material design and characterization to field use in Phase II and beyond. Our aerospace partners will provide direct input and willactively participate by assisting with the required testing of viable formulations. Our approach is based on the results obtained thus far. The low cost and simple techniques used in the new processes, are very likely to result in viable lighter,non-hazardous RAMs that will qualify for airborne, ground or naval-based applications.\"",

We have obtained excellent results relative to several aspects of the technology, particularly sensitivity and selectivity using few molecular layers of the different polymers.

It is difficult enough for human beings to take into account all relevant factors to make an optimal routing and tactics selection, even in a relaxed environment with plenty of time.More often, route and tactics selection must be made \"on the fly,\" in an information overloaded, time-constrained, and dangerous environment that is not conducive to careful consideration of all relevant factors. Consequently, manual route and tacticsselection is often non-optimal from many standpoints, even when made by highly experienced personnel. Such non-optimal route and tactics selection could result in disoriented attack helicopter forces at the objective, unplanned encounters with threats, ordetection by enemy forces, all of which could result in a failed mission.

Even with the recent terrorist activities, the defense procurement budget has dramatically fallen from its peak, and DoD and the Military Services aredemanding more performance for less cost. Gone are the days when new systems could be developed and produced simply for reasons of greater payload, better reliability, more weapons on target, improved technology, etc. Now the benefits of performanceimprovements must be balanced against cost to arrive at a \"best value\" solution. In other words, the technology must be affordable. In the past, affordability was not often a priority for Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) programs because the emphasiswas on new technology, and the focus was strictly on performance. AFRL is attempting to measure and report return on investment (ROI) for Science and Technology (S&T;) programs. Since a cost saving can't always be demonstrated for a new technology thatprovides previously unattainable military capability, innovative methods of measuring both investment and return, need to be developed, especially for technologies that do not have a manufacturing focus. This SBIR develops the methodology, processes andtools to evaluate the affordability on S&T; investments\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         SBIR phase I will lay the groundwork for standardized Echinacea production in Phase II. The source of crude material for subsequent analytical chemistry testing will be first addressed: Echinacea seeds will be tested and identified for purity, then germinated and cultivated at different seasons/soil/field conditions, and morphologic, organoleptic, chromosome/DNA, and microscopic characteristics will be systematically monitored and recorded. Simultaneously, all marker compounds and testing methodology to be used later will be developed in the first 6 months. The marker compound testing will begin in the last 6 months using samples from Gaia Herbs organic farm. The testing will include samples representing the different factors that influence the potential medicinal activities of Echinacea, e.g., parts of plant, species, and horticulture. Different extraction preparations will be developed based on marker compound analysis, and products developed based on extraction quality. The most desirable delivery forms will then be developed based on retesting analysis. Thus, specific aims of Phase I include: 1) preparation of raw material source for use in Phase II, data collection on plant identity; 2) preparation of marker compounds and testing methods; 3) marker compound testing to identify promising end products using different extraction solvents and strategy (i.e., best combination extraction types correlated with chemical component concentrations in plant parts and species); 4) evaluate optimum delivery presentation and product stability; 5) execution and direction of Phase II to deliver Phase I milestone; 6) share the knowledge and practices gained with the herbal industry and regulatory agencies. The growing Echinacea planted in Phase I will provide samples for analytical testing and product development for three years in Phase II, and more critically, the carefully monitored and characterized 1,2, and 3 year old plants growing in different soil conditions and harvesting times must be available to start Phase II. Long-term goals include new technology development viable for herbal industry and herb farms. The ultimate hope is to provide consumers, researchers, herbal industry, and health- care providers with easily recognized product quality and identity, and to scientifically establish or disprove the medicinal value of Echinacea. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: In the process of manufacturing reproducible Echinacea products, new innovative technologies will also be developed  through out the production process. All of the following can be modified and further developed for commercial application: 1) Identity testing of species/seeds that is simple, fast, and economical; 2) marker component analytical testing methodology that is commercially viable; 3) condition and materials used in the greenhouse for high-yield germination; 4) soil condition and materials used for quality raw material; 5) alternatives to pesticides/herbicides for organic farming that is not time consuming nor expensive; 6) Echinacea product that is manufactured in the same quality as the research products; and 7) product delivery presentation (form and package) that is convenient for consumers, which is also stable in quality, concentration, and purity to the date of expiration.",

The decision to develop a mission-critical electro-optical sensor requires both technical design information andcost/affordability data, as well as an understanding of the relationship between the two and the inherent technical and cost risk.We propose to produce a model to use new and innovative mathematical theories coupled with more traditional product- and process-based parametrics to quickly yet accurately estimate costs for space-based elector-optical sensors.  In finalcommercialization, we will also couple automated design tools (CAD/CAM) to automated cost tools, providing the capability to examine both the technical and cost implications for a wide range of design options.\"",

Scope is generally captured by a specific metric, such as lines of code or function points.

This project directly addresses the problem of producing an early estimate of project size.  The AutoGen suite of automated software sizingtools will advance the state of software sizing by allowing early estimation of size from UML use cases, estimation from software requirements documents, and automated estimation of size from requirements repositories.  To attain higher accuracy, thesetools will use estimating methodologies that are trainable to particular circumstances.\"",

Lead compounds will first be defined using in vitro endpoints       for interference with lymphocyte function, emphasizing the additional                collection of trans-epithelial monolayer barrier penetration data as a               surrogate for possible oral activity. Careful pharmacokinetic and activity data      measurements for lead compounds in an Aspergillus fumigatus spore-induced            murine model of airway inflammation using both oral and intratracheal routes of      aminosterol administration will subsequently be taken to select a few                aminosterols for formal preclinical development. These compounds will be             compared to the water soluble lead compounds MSI-1 432 and MSI-f 828 shown           active in phase I research for intratracheal delivery, while discovery of an         orally active aminosterol is given priority in parallel experimentation.             Preparation and formulation of a single lead aminosterol to GMP standards will       then be rapidly instituted for delivery by the preferred route of                    administration, along with necessary supporting analytical method development,       and a first acute rat toxicity GLP study will be initiated as the first of a         series of preclinical safety studies to support use in humans. The eventual          goal is to enter human clinical trials in asthma patients by 2004 with an            orally delivered aminosterol emerging from the phase Il SBIR research.       PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Asthma affects more than 14?15 million U.S. citizens\" 5 million of whom are children, and more than 5,000 die of asthmatic disease each year. The health related costs of asthma are estimated for the year 2000 to exceed $14.5 billion, and asthma (and asthma costs) are on the rise among inner city residents. There is a significant need for better and more novel treatments for asthma, notably those with fewer side effects and that are easier for patients to use. Aminosterols are a new class of anti-inflammatory agents discovered by Genaera Corporation that are preferentially active with Th2-type T cells and that may offer several advantages to asthma patients, including the ability to self-administer.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A major impediment to the successful use of aerosol gene therapy for the treatment of lung diseases is the lack of an efficient and safe aerosol delivery strategy. When the transgene vector is a cationic liposome/plasmid DNA complex, factors that must be considered in designing the optimal aerosol device are the intrinsic instability of the  liposome/plasmid complex, physical disruption of the complex upon y aerosolization, and maximizing the amount of the complex deposited in the lung     \r  while minimizing contamination of the environment with exhaled transgene           \r  vector. Under support of a Phase I SBIR, we have systematically evaluated how      \r  physical stability and the process of aerosolization affects transfection          \r  efficacy in airway cells in vitro. These data have permitted us to design a        \r  liposome/plasmid DNA aerosolization device for use in humans with pulmonary and    \r  pulmonary vascular disease, which we believe could deliver potentially             \r  therapeutic genes to the airspaces in a highly efficient and safe manner. The      \r  purpose of this Phase II application is to develop a prototype plasmid/liposome    \r  delivery device to the point that it is testable in humans. Specifically, we       \r  propose to use this strategy to deliver the gene encoding the cyclooxygenase       \r  (COX) enzyme to the distal airspaces of humans with primary pulmonary              \r  hypertension (PPH). In order to achieve this goal, we will quantify pulmonary      \r  deposition, distribution, and clearance profiles in normal sheep of aerosols       \r  with different particle sizes aiming to maximize distal deposition; test           \r  strategies for improving the physical stability of the complex; and using the      \r  optimized delivery system, determine the efficacy of delivering the COX gene to    \r  distal airspaces in reversing pulmonary hypertension in the sheep model of PPH.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: (Provided by Applicant) DNA vaccines offer an attractive alternative to create effective vaccines that are inexpensive to manufacture, and can be widely distributed. One of the most difficult tasks in developing a DNA vaccine is the identification of the antigen that will stimulate the most effective immune response against the pathogen, particularly when the genome of the infectious organism is large. A technology developed by Gene Therapy Systems Inc. under a previously funded SBIR grant (R43 AI47641-01) will be applied to the general problem of how to identify potent DNA vaccine antigens from complex organisms. The technology called Transciptionally Active PCR (commercial name \"TAP ExpressTM\") is a method for generating functional PCR fragments that can be used directly in in vitro transfection assays and in vivo. TAP fragments are as active as supercoiled plasmids in all assays examined including DNA vaccine immunizations, enabling high throughput functional screening of a very large number of genes, on a scale that has not been previously possible. In this proposal several enhancements will be added to the technology and it will be used to screen 424 malaria antigens with the goal of identifying new DNA vaccine antigens that have improved protective immunological activity.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The resources from this grant will be used to continue the development of a practical method for generating transcriptionally active PCR (TAP) fragments, which can be used directly in in vitro transfection assays and in vivo.  A high throughput vaccine antigen screening system will be developed to enable the identification of potent vaccine antigens from complex organisms such as malaria.",

Feasibility demonstrations in Phase I confirmed that a pulsed laser operating at 1064 nm with a radiance of 15 to 30 MW/CM2 iseffective in removing pre-specified surface layers of LO material.  Feedback electronics are able to control the laser firing circuit so that the removal process automatically terminates when the material substrate becomes exposed.  GLC confirmed that highefficiency, diode-pumped laser systems can achieve the necessary radiance for LO coating removal.  The demonstration unit was similar to that which the Air Force Safety Office (AF/SES) has stated is explosion safe.

The mold that produces fumaric acid from glucose has a tendency to form large pellets. When that happens, oxygen shortage will develop in the pellet center that will make the cells to produce ethanol instead of fumaric acid. An objective is to further test techniques that have been developed and verified in Phase I work to overcome this problem. 2. The second objective is to further test a number of techniques for recovery of fumaric acid from the fermentation broth. Being an acid, its accumulation in the fermentation broth will reduce pH that in turn will inhibit further biological activities. The product acid has to be either neutrilized and/or removed as it is formed by the cells. The tests for this Phase II project are for recovering fumaric acid as a free acid product for potential marketing. 3. The third objective is to collect enough data for supporting future process degin and cost analysis to prepare for pilot plant testing and commercialization.",

This was achieved by the innovative development and testing of high density reactive composites which as projectiles or impacting structurescan deliver large amounts of chemical energy to the target in addition to kinetic, in a non-parasitic manner.  This effort proved that (a) these materials can be manufactured with sufficient strength to survive the acceleration roads, (b) the chemicalenergy (which can be higher than the kinetic term) couples with target two times more effectively than kinetic, (c) the resulting damage on space metal target is ten times higher than inert steel projectiles of equal mass, density and velocity.  The thrustof the proposed Phase II effort is to advance this technology to the next level of development with more complete and realistic testing and materials scale-up, with the ultimate objective utilizing reactive composites as parts of interceptor structure forkill enhancement and the Multiple Miniature Kill Vehicle (MMKV) for more effective discrimination of balloons and other decoys in the presence of re-entry vehicles.  Under this effort material properties will be addressed in order to develop reactivecomposites with sufficient strength and high thermal output so that they can receive serious consideration for transition/insertion into scaled-up ground tests and a future flight.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, killing approximately 32,000 men annually. An urgent need exists for improved diagnostic and prognostic tools. PSA tests are\r widely used diagnostic tools, but they yield an unacceptable degree of false\r positives and false negatives. Due to a lack of prognostic tools, many men\r undergo unnecessary, radical treatments. We describe herein a systematic\r program for the discovery of secreted prostate tumor biomarkers. In Phase I, we\r developed a ?secretion trap?, a protocol for rapid isolation of a library of\r secreted sequence tags from any source. Since a ?trapped? library identifies\r accessible proteins, e.g. cell surface and extracellular proteins, it is a\r powerful means for discovering biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic\r potential. We will generate a library of secreted sequence tags from prostate\r tumors and we will choose 100 that fulfill basic criteria required of useful\r biomarkers. We will determine the expression profiles of the candidate markers\r by automated, high-throughput in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.\r Finally, we will determine whether any of these biomarkers are present in the\r serum of patients with prostate cancer. These experiments will identify\r biomarkers that may be commercialized as diagnostic or prognostic indicators.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cultured mammalian cells are the most           commonly used model organisms, both in academic and in industrial biology.           However, the tools that are available for manipulating these cells have been         relatively primative compared to those available in other model organisms, such      as C. elegans and Drosophila. It has been the primary mission of Genetica to         develop technologies that improve the ability to manipulate mammalian cells in       culture. A collateral benefit of such studies will also be improved                  technologies to manipulate mammalian model organisms. Genetica has developed a       suite of tools, the MaRX system, which enable forward genetics to be harnessed       to address numerous biological problems in cell culture. However, to date, we        have most often used this system for rescue of phenotypes by ectopic                 expression. The goal of this proposal is to develop the ability to use               double-stranded RNA-induced gene silencing (RNAi) as a tool for stable               suppression of gene function in mammalian cells. This goal is strongly rooted        in promising preliminary data that predicts the ultimate success of this             endeavor. Such success would revolutionize the ability of investigators              studying mammalian cells to determine gene function and would thus have              profound affects on the identification and validation of potential therapeutic       targets.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In current practice, radiation therapy planning (RTP) has often been treated as a two-dimensional (2D) problem, mainly due to the limitations in visualization technology and resources. The slice-by-slice display format makes it difficult to visualize the path of any radiation beam not perpendicular to the axis of the CT slices. This drawback also discourages consideration of all treatment plans that utilize radiation beam out of the transverse plane. Human body anatomical structures are inherently 3D objects, and the tumor and tissues/organs involved in the RTP are all of 3D shapes. A clear understanding of 3D relationships among these structures as well as dose distributions in 3D is essential for designing and evaluating radiation therapy plans. An interactive volumetric 3D display would significantly enhance the safety and speed of RTP procedure. It would offer \"understanding at a glance\", which is necessary to keep clinicians from becoming bogged down in endless details, as they would be if provided only with conventional 2D display of CT slices with overlaid isodose lines. Genex Technologies, Inc. has recently made an important breakthrough in the high-resolution volumetric 3D display technology and attempted to apply it to RTP applications. By \"volumetric 3D display\", we mean that each \"voxel\" in the displayed 3D images locates physically at the (x, y, z) spatial position where it supposed to be, and emits light from that position to form real 3D images in the eyes of viewers. In our Phase 1 project, we have demonstrated the feasibility of our system design and achieved a multi-color, large display volume, true volumetric 3D display system with an unprecedented high resolution of over 10 million voxels in a portable design. The prototype of this true 3D display system is already able to present dynamic interactive volumetric 3D images of a patient's anatomy with transparent skin. The powerful 3D visualization capability provides both physiological and psychological depth cues to oncologists in perceiving and manipulating radiation beam configuration in true 3D fashion, thus offering a unique visualization tool to ensure the safety, effectiveness, and speed of the RTP process. In our Phase 2 program, we will further enhance the performance of the volumetric 30 display, integrate the newly developed 3D display capability into the 'Interactive RTP Environment\" prototype, and perform preliminary pre-clinical evaluation on the effectiveness of the volumetric 3D display and the interactive RTP environment technique in realistic RTP applications. The ultimate goal of this SBlR program is to develop a clinically viable commercial product as an augmented visualization tool that will provide unique 3D display and visualization capability to aid oncologists in RTP.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In Phase I Giner, Inc. successfully demonstrated the feasibility of a novel electrochemical sensor that detects gaseous ethylene for NASA?s use in studying the effects of microgravity on plants and in growing plants for use in missions. Ethylene (C2H4) is a plant hormone that is active at very low concentrations in the developmental and reproductive processes of plants. With the Phase I prototype sensor, the detection range for ethylene in air was 22-800 parts per billion (ppb) (volume/volume). The sensor did not experience interference from CO2, N2 or O2, but NO and NO2 did show some cross reactivity on the sensor. Ethylene was successfully detected in headspace samples from cell culture systems with Catharanthus roseus and is being compared to GC/MS analysis of those gas samples. The Phase II goals include: 1) extension of the detection range to 5 to 5000 ppb, by a design change to increase the active sensing area while decreasing background noise 2) extensive validation and improvement of ethylene accuracy and specificity in laboratory and field settings and 3) fabrication of a low power, compact, light instrument for delivery to NASA.",

By combining the advantages of the electrochemical capacitor solid polymer electrolyte and the electrolytic capacitor, the proposed design will yield a high voltage, small volume and low Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) device with simplified packaging process, Besides the potential for volume and/or mass reductions, which will significantly contribute to the clinically important efforts of reducing the size of the presently implantable defibrillator, other inherent characteristics of hybrid capacitor could be critical drivers for selection of this technology for implantable defibrillators. Incorporating the solid electrolyte would eliminate any possibility of electrolyte leakage, thus enhancing reliability, life and safety of the proposed hybrid capacitor, which will have a significant impact on selection of this technology. During Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed concept of the solid polymer electrolyte hybrid capacitor was clearly demonstrated. For Phase II it is planned to extend the investigation to identify methods for further modification of the internal anode structure by increasing its surface area to gain higher capacitance. It is planned to optimize and standardize processes and designs, to build stacks, evaluate capacitor housing and encapsulation materials and procedures, to perform long-term stability and reliability tests, and to study and select sterilization and packaging options. Phase 11, and Phase Ill work related to product development and production preparation tasks will be performed together with a capacitor company working with customers in the ICD and heart-support field.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The commjercial  potential of this application is significant, there is critical need for reduced size, high energry density capacitor for the implantable defibrillators, in addition these technologies are needed to open up a significant opportunity for making other implantable support devices, i.e., for nerve and muscle stimulation. There are also many applications for the proposed hybrid capacitor for military and industrial applications where a high energry density pulse or bust power source of a high voltage/capacitance electronic element is required.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65493       Future high field (15T+) dipole magnets will require higher performance superconductors, and long lengths will be needed to reduce the cost of these conductors.  The A15-type conductors are the most likely superconductors to fulfill this need, but it is very difficult to process the wire without breaks, especially when billet sizes are increased to produce 5-25 km lengths.  This processing difficulty is related to the hardness of the multifilamentary composite and the bonding of the filaments.  This project will investigate an ultrasonic processing technique to reduce drawing forces and increase bonding between the filaments.  Phase I demonstrated several ultrasonic wire drawing equipment designs.  The ultrasonic drawing forces were shown to be as little as 55% less compared to the non-ultrasonic wire drawing A15 type superconductors.  In addition, ultrasonic wire drawing was demonstrated for multi-filament composites, which was not possible with conventional conical dies.  Phase II will design and build a high power ultrasonic wire drawing setup.  The optimum ultrasonic wire drawing parameters, for preventing filament breakage and improving inter-filament bonding, will be determined for multi-filament A15 superconducting composites.                 Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Although the largest market should be for accelerator and fusion magnets, high field magnets (above 5 tesla) should also have applicability for MRI, NMR, high gradient magnetic separators, and SMES applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Dermal anesthetics are used to anesthetize the skin of patients for various reasons, ranging from minor cutaneous surgery and needle inserts to skin grafts. The dermal anesthetic market is dominated by a single preparation, called EMLA (AstraZeneca), which consists of a eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine bases. EMLA?s principal drawback is a long onset time for dermal anesthesia, requiring up to two hours for full effect. The results of our Phase I studies demonstrate that we have arrived at compounds that are superior to EMLA in every respect. The new compounds offer faster onset of anesthetic activity, deeper local anesthesia, and longer duration of anesthesia than EMLA. We have selected a lead compound - racemic TAC-34 - and a backup compound - TAC-HP. (The enantiomers of TAC-34 possessed similar activity.) Both lead and backup compounds meet and exceed our original selection criteria. The goal of the phase II project is to acquire the data package needed to select the Candidate Drug, and to prepare the Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for submission to the Food and Drug Administration. Specific aims designed to meet this goal include: 1. to develop scale-up synthesis methods, analytical procedures, and formulations of both isomeric TAC-34 and the backup compound TAC-HP to further evaluate efficacy and toxicity for selection of the Candidate Drug; 2. to carry out the preclinical toxicity testing and to prepare the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control information necessary to support the IND application for the Candidate Drug. After the first-in-man studies, we intend to license out this project to one of the pharmaceutical companies that has already expressed strong interest in this project.",

Our approach is based on the analysis of IC substrate chemical properties pertaining to opacityto laser emissions at various operational parameters (e.g., frequencies, modulation, etc.), and the resulting specification of requirements for IC laser illumination and capture of laser generated images. Multiresolution analysis and other imaging analysistechniques are used to examine the laser images to determine the existence of artifacts that may relate to the properties and characteristics of IC failure. These artifacts are then categorized for diagnostic use. With enhancements to the image resolution,this approach will be useful for both the current and future generations of ICs. If successful, the results of this research would form the basis for an entirely new method of detecting IC failures and degraded performance that are otherwise undetectableusing presently available testing techniques.\"",

The key element unique to this application involves the design of novel methods of displaying extremely high-resolution images along with the normal textfields associated with databases using methods that are not available today. The focus of this research is the Registry of Tumors in Low Animals (RTLA) sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and presented operated by George Washington University. Currently, text pertaining to the description, analysis, and diagnosis of tissue specimens provided to GWU, along with bibliography information is created in hardcopy and entered into Access databases that have limited availability through the GWU website. Gross specimen and microscopic image photographs of the specimen assist and diagnosis, and are filed along with the hardcopy report and are not circulated. New methods of capturing extremely high-resolution microscopic images are currently being investigated for this database. The research proposed in this application will lead the way in developing novel display technologies that overcome the severe limitations of the Internet in efficiently downloading and viewing these high-resolution images and will provide new capability to the Low Animal Tumor Registry in the process.

Goembel Instruments has developed just such an instrument - the Spacecraft Charge Monitor (SCM). In Phase I we built and tested a prototype SCM. Results from Phase I show that the SCM will revolutionize the field of spacecraft charge detection. The 500 gram, 1 Watt, instrument will be able to determine spacecraft floating potential to within 0.1 volt for each second in flight. The SCM's performance represents an order of magnitude improvement over what is available now. In Phase II we will advance the SCM from laboratory prototype to flight prototype. We will develop flight electronics, a flight sensor head, calibrate the instrument, put it through a series of tests for flight worthiness, and deliver the fully tested flight instrument and documentation to NASA. The Phase II work will produce an SCM for flight tests, and will prepare us for the Phase III production of instruments.",

This is important for upcoming space missions to extremely cold environments, because it can greatly reduce the need for thermal control and required spacecraft power. These missions include those to the outer planets and other cold sites of primary interest in the Solar System, such as Europa as well as interstellar missions. Preliminary measurements confirm that Ge diodes and some types of Ge bipolar transistors can operate down to the required deep cryogenic temperatures, namely the vicinity of liquid-helium temperature (4K). The objective of this Phase I effort is to demonstrate the advantages of Ge devices for cryogenic power applications and to determine the feasibility of producing the necessary types of devices. Deliverables will include working prototypes with characterization at 4K and 77K and the identification of promising technologies for fuller implementation in Phase II.",

In systems that make use of mobile code, such as Java applets, the situation is yet more difficult. A more flexible and powerful approach is needed that will allow a wider range of security policies to be set by various policy-setting authorities for different applications. At the same time, there must be check-box simplicity. We propose to commercialize mechanisms for specifying and enforcing security policies for mobile code that work by inserting fragments of code into programs in order to monitor their state and prevent them from violating security policies. The proposed system will allow arbitrary policies to be specified independently by different policy-setting authorities. We will apply this approach, named Inlined Reference Monitors (IRMs), to Java bytecode using a technique called aspect-oriented programming. We will leverage existing static-analysis technologies in the implementation of a security policy toolkit.",

Firmwarepresents a tempting target to an attacker because of its ubiquity, the potential efficacy of an attack, and relatively low investment requirements.  Traditional efforts at security analysis have naively assumed that the firmware is in the trusted-computingbase.  We propose the development of a tool that uses a deep-structure representation of programs to help statically find occurrences of malicious code in firmware.  The tool will be semi-automatic.  When suspicious code is found, an analyst can bedirected to its location, and provided with all the available static-analysis information to help make the final determination.  The main challenge is to conduct research into techniques for increasing the precision of the dependence graph representationof machine-code programs.  This is necessary to reduce the number of false-positive results from the analysis.  The tool will have multiple uses in many domains, including program understanding, forensics, assurance and decompilation; and will beapplicable not only to firmware, but also to any machine-code program.\"",

Unfortunately, current practice usually yields software that is generally unreliable and insecure.  The industry must reduce reliance on methods thatcan only detect the presence of faults, and move towards methods that can demonstrate their absence.  Model checking is a verification technique that allows users to verify crosscutting properties of systems.  During Phase I of this project, we developed anew technique for model checking based on using context-free-language reachability algorithms.  These allow us to exploit the inherent modularity in procedural abstraction, and thus allow the technique to be scaled to large programs.  We constructed aprototype of a system and demonstrated how it can be used to find real faults in software.  We investigated methods for using our dependence graph and program slicing technology to construct models of a reduced size so as to further improve the scalabilityof the system.  In Phase II, we propose to build on our Phase I results and create a product capable of being applied to industrial-sized problems.  Initial evidence suggests great potential benefits.  Our commercialization strategy will ensure rapidexploitation and early success in Phase III.\"",

Silicon structures at extreme nanoscale dimensions exhibit distinctlydifferent physical properties than the bulk material.  In particular, these structures have lower melting points, are flexible, and exhibit either tensile, or compressive strain.  Growth on these types of structures is expected to alleviate thermalexpansion mismatch.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the traditional wheelchair design, employing pushrims for propulsion, is simple and reliable, it is unfortunately inefficient and injurious. Research conducted at HERL has shown that only about half of the force being applied to the pushrim produces useful torque. In addition, researchers have associated several common injuries with pushrim propulsion. Surveys of manual wheelchair users show the prevalence of shoulder pain to be between 31 and 73% and of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome to be between 49 and 73%.   A lever drive wheelchair transmission has the potential to reduce all of the risk factors for wrist and shoulder injuries. This Phase I program has demonstrated a lever drive with a mechanical efficiency of over 90%. The improvement in propulsion efficiency, coupled with the improved biomechanics of the lever drive, could substantially reduce new wrist and shoulder injuries, ameliorate existing injuries and allow some individuals the option of continuing to use a manual wheelchair.   In this proposed Phase II program, we will continue engineering development of the lever drive transmission begun in Phase I, incorporating shift-on-the-fly capability and dynamic braking. Metabolic testing will be conducted on two models to document improvements in propulsion efficiency and in biomechanics.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Wheelchairs are in widespread use throughout the world.  In the US alone, there are around 1.5 million wheelchair users.  Of these, it is estimated that one half will eventually develop CTS and/or shoulder injuries such as rotator cuff tears.  A wheelchair that could reduce the number of these injuries or allow injured users to continue to use a manual whelchair would find broad acceptance.",

The application of this space technology provides an innovative method of using a combination of films and fibers for locally reinforcing a balloon envelope based on its specific design requirements. In Phase 1, 3DR was evaluated for its applicability to meeting the requirements of NOAA's GAINS program. Results showed that envelope volumes could be reduced by 25-33% resulting in a 33-43% reduction in envelope mass. The Phase 2 goal is to provide empirical validation to 3DR's potential for practical application and commercialization of terrestrial balloon platforms. The Phase 2 technical objectives include validating the 3DR design and material selection methods, and reducing the experimental fabrication procedures to acceptable production processes. This will be accomplished through the development and testing of a commercially viable wind tracer balloon.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65647              Recent advances in high frequency linear accelerator technology have resulted in steady-state electron beams having RF bunch widths of 50 to 200 femtoseconds, considerably shorter than the practical resolution of fast diagnostic streak camera systems.  Therefore, the accurate measurement of the longitudinal phase space of ultra short bunches using microwave power would be highly advantageous and economically attractive, especially if the complexity, sensitivity, and a priori assumptions associated with alternative electro-optic methods could be avoided.  This project will develop a circularly-polarized, beam-deflecting microwave structure that provides a highly amplified image display of the electron bunch, with phase and energy distributions projected in orthogonally-differentiated azimuthal and radial directions.  Combining such a microwave structure with a beam focusing element offers a simple on-line diagnostic for the definitive measurement of ultra short RF bunches.  During Phase I, a detailed microwave and beam optics analysis was performed, and the results indicated that, with an emittance-limited beam image focused at the analyzing plane, a dual-input circularly-polarized microwave structure could produce phase resolution less than 1 degree (100 femtoseconds at 17 gigahertz).  In addition, the design parameters of all major components were established, and an overall layout drawing was prepared to show how the bunch monitoring system could be integrated into an existing accelerator test facility.  Phase II will fabricate the microwave beam deflector and the associated rectangular waveguide network, the beam focusing system and diagnostic chamber, and the peripheral subsystems.  The electro bunch diagnostic equipment will be integrated into an existing 17 gigahertz linear accelerator test facility, and high power beam tests will be conducted to evaluate the performance of the overall system.                   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should result in an on-line beam monitoring system capable of accurately evaluating the RF bunch performance of advanced accelerator systems.  The attainment of very short RF bunches should be of considerable interest for free electron lasers, wakefield accelerators, linear colliders, and the generation of intense coherent radiation",

The feasibility of HMSSS processes was clearly substantiated by Phase I test results, which showed that the processed products met FDA requirements. Phase II is the critical step to commercialization. Refinement in production systems, documentation of processes for community entry, further development of direct seawater retrieval and solar power systems, and extensions of commercial plans (marketing, operations, and financing) are primary activities for this research and development. With these implementations, HMSSS can directly create full-time and part-time jobs over the next two years, significant in a community with high unemployment. The project will expand economic development by allowing interested individuals choice in their participation at the commercial level of production. Choices will include direct employment, as well as entrepreneurial engagement in varying stages of salt production: processing, wholesaling, and retailing.",

The detector uses graded multilayers as analyzers and large area detectors for data collection to achieve good energy resolution and to avoid count rate problems encountered by solid state detectors. Furthermore, the detector will be tunable in a wide energy region and easy to operate. Testing results obtained in Phase 1 indicate that the detector will have a throughput between 20 to 30%, and a bandwidth of 3-4%. In the Phase 2 project, we will design and fabricate the multilayer array analyzer/detectors with large solid angle, which will be optimized in two energy regions: 500 to 1000 eV, and 1000 eV to 2000 eV. The detectors will be evaluated for their performance, and will be marketed as a generally used soft x-ray fluorescence detector for x-ray spectroscopy, fluorescence analysis, and imaging experiments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (adapted from applicant's abstract): Pathogenic organisms are            believed to be responsible for a number of infections, neurodegenerative and as      well as some types of neuropsychiatric diseases. Detection of neuroactive            pathogens, at the earliest stages, would be a critical factor in the diagnosis       and treatment of any possible neuropathological consequences. Enzyme-linked          immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are already          being used separately as specific microbial detection methods. In the present        project, we propose to develop a technology of pathogen detection, which             combines the advantages of ELISA and those of PCR. This is expected to result        in a highly efficient, reproducible method for the detection of very small           numbers of pathogens, even before they can elicit the normal host immune             response. The project will be carried out in two phases. In phase 1, the method      of immuno-PCR will be standardized by measuring proteins and peptides that have      special importance in brain function or pathology. This will be done using           either brain cells where they are specifically and abundantly expressed, or in       heterologous cells, such as lymphocytes, where they are expressed at very low        levels, by a phenomenon known as \"'illegitimate transcription\". In phase 2 we        will extend the protocols developed in phase 1 to detect and quantitatively          measure some of the pathogens that are commonly found in human populations and       which are of great concern to public health authorities. Four different              approaches to immuno-PCR will be compared, based (a) on electrophoresis and          ethidium bromide staining of the amplified DNA and densitometry of the band          obtained: (b) measurement of fluorescence produced following reaction of the         PCR mixture with the dye, PicoGreen; colorimetry following reaction of               chromogenic substrate with digoxigenin-alkaline phosphate ligated to DNA; and        (d) fluorometry of the complex produced by the action of a fluorescent               substance (AttoPhos) on the DNA-digoxigenin complex.                                 PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  (a) Development of rapid and highly sensitive, early detection kits for neuropathogens in  human and animal tissues and body fluids; (b) Evaluation of the efficiency of vaccines,  commonly used in persons at risk for infection; (c) Evaluation of the immune reaction  subsequent to primary infection or immunization, and (d) possible identification and   treatment of microorganisms responsible for idiopathic neuropathogenesis.",

Research results from a previous Phase I grant provide the conceptual and scientific foundations for these products. Two independent research projects are proposed. In collaboration with the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Institute, ALERTS content will be developed and statewide system implementation will be promoted and evaluated by a regionally disperse network of diagnostic clinics and local chapters of the Alzheimer's Association. Modules to be included in ALERTS will be: (1) educational information about dementia; (2) current treatments; (3) informant-based or individual direct screening; (4) caregiver support; and (5) local resource referral. If successful in promoting early detection and initiation of dementia treatment, ALERTS design will permit nationwide expansion and multilingual delivery. Continued support and system expansion would be beneficial to public health agencies, private patient advocacy groups, and the pharmaceutical industry. In collaboration with the NIA-funded Alzheimer's Disease Center at Stanford University, a 24-week longitudinal study of TREND will be conducted with 105 subjects (N=35 from elderly controls, mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia). TREND data will be compared to clinical assessments using both the cognitive and non-cognitive items of the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) to assess the reliability and validity of IVR automated monitoring of longitudinal changes in cognitive functioning.  If successful, pharmaceutical companies could be provided the ability to collect reliable and valid data remotely with electronic storage of data for immediate availability during and after randomized clinical trials. TREND availability would permit frequent patient evaluation with fewer logistic difficulties than is currently possible. Such capabilities would promote more rapid submission of effective compounds to the Food and Drug Administration and reduce drug development cycles. Methodological proof-of-concept regarding IVR assessment of cognitive deficits would open new avenues for research into treatments of many disorders and diseases, such as schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, alcohol and other drug dependence, and stroke.",

The principal objective of the first part is to conduct hot-wire measurements to assess the accuracy of Dean?s Two Microphone Impedance Measurement Method. They will also be used to calibrate CAA numerical codes. The principal objective of the second part is to develop a computationally simple 2-DOF resonator impedance model. The model will include non-linearity of the cavity sound particle velocities pumped into/out-of the inner/outer orifices. The model will be calibrated by Impedance measurements as a function of SPL and grazing flow speed.The principal objective of the third part is to use hot-wires to measure cavity inflow/outflow sound particle velocities near the orifices of multiple orifice resonators, backed by a common cavity. These measurements should provide fundamental understanding of orifice-to-orifice interaction. They will be used to assess potential resonator bandwidth improvement as a function of orifice spacing in grazing flow applications.The principal objective of the fourth part is to design and construct a prototype low self-noise probe microphone to measure broadband sound in high-speed flow duct applications. The performance of the prototype probe will be validated in the NASA LaRC 2-in by 2-in wind tunnel.",

Space allocation and weight constraints require the solution of the redundancy problem within current envelopes.  By reducing the size and dimensional tolerances of the elements used in the thermoelectric module, a parallel circuit will be incorporated into the module design without increasing the module size.  Phase I: (1) demonstrated new tooling that results in near-perfect alignment of the smaller legs in a matrix module with parallel circuitry,  (2) demonstrated semi-automation of gold tab spot welding of the smaller legs and a gold deposition system for element connections, and (3) identified and analyzed two parallel circuit designs.  Phase II will (1) further develop the matrix fabrication process for near perfect alignment, (2) continue the development of both the gold deposition process and the parallel gap spot welding at gold tabs, and (3) fabricate and evaluate modules with the two (serpentine and cluster) parallel circuitry designs.               Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The small thermoelectric modules should have use in powering remote sensors for the wireless transmission of data.  Early warning and protection of critical, expensive, and safety related equipment should be achieved.",

Transition location uncertainties forcedesigners to be conservative by adding weight and reducing thrust.  Efficient techniques for prediction and control of boundary-layer transition are needed.  The proposed effort deals with the development of a unified software package for advancedtransition analysis and prediction.  This transition prediction tool includes the effect of external (free-stream, wall-induced) disturbances on boundary-layer transition which is accomplished by coupling a receptivity module with a disturbance growthmodule.  The receptivity module determines the relationship between the imposed disturbances and boundary-layer instability waves, while the disturbance growth module computes the evolution of these instabilities and determines the location of transition.The disturbance growth and the receptivity modules will be incorporated in the unified software package, USAT, in a way that minimizes problem setup time as well as computational time.  The software package will be developed for use by aerospace designers.\"",

This system will measure the position, velocity and deformation of flight control surfaces in an aircraft where such deformation typically includes bending and twist of these surfaces produced by aerodynamic forces. The Phase I effort focuses on performing a feasibility study of the proposed technique and demonstrating a prototype system. A follow-on Phase II effort would culminate with a working commercial system which will be validated in appropriate wind tunnel and/or flight tests. The significance of such a system is that it provides accurate, non-contact measurements of motion, as well as deformation of a flight control surface using digital photogrammetry. In Phase II, the system will also be enhanced to determine the stresses on flight control surfaces, based on motion and deformation measurements. This innovative system will be robust and easy-to-use, and suitable for a variety of aircrafts.",

Samples are placed in direct contact with a grainless fluorescent-screen and illuminated with soft x-rays radiated by an extremely hot laser-produced plasma. The resulting luminescent shadowgraph is observed using optical microscopy. The device can produce images showing the three dimensional structure of unstained living cells at a resolution near 100 nm. An extremely brief exposure duration of several nanoseconds results in very sharp images, even in the presence of significant specimen motility. The instrument should find widespread application in many biomedical research areas. Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of construction such an instrument using a design that was sufficiently compact for mounting directly onto the sample stage of a commercial optical microscope. This allowed the observation of both dry and hydrated test objects using either optical microscopy or soft x-ray microfluoroscopy. Phase II research will develop an advanced version of the instrument that will take full advantage of the unique imaging characteristics of the technique. The instrument will be appropriately designed for subsequent commercialization. Testing will include evaluating the instruments effectiveness in a real research investigation.",

These devices will incorporate novel materials such as high temperaturesuperconductors (HTS), electro-optics and cryo-cooling features. The devices such as high-Q tunable filters will also achieve ultra-high sensitivity in signal interception and processing capabilities. Integrated with other receiver chain components, thesedevices will form the foundation of the microsensor-communication link vital to the successful performance of the Future Combat Systems (FCS). The concept of the FCS is accurate detection of threats and rapid and mobile deployment of forces to counter andneutralize these threats. In the detection phase, microsensors are deployed to uncover hostile combatants with lightweight weapons concealed in defensive and offensive positions within a battlefield range. These distributed microsensors collect seismic,magnetic, radiation, sonic and other outputs from the threats and transmit the information to the communication link for further processing and countermeasures. The sensitivity of these microsensors and quality of the communications channels must beoptimized. This proposal will contribute to this optimization process and therefore improve and enhance the sensing-communicating features of the FCS.\"",

The objective of the program is to minimize the DC power consumption in phased array receive antennas by circuitdesign and device modifications.  In particular the program focus is on the development of 44 GHz LNAs.  Results of the Phase I contract are summarized as a part of this Phase II proposal.  A publication survey was carried out to identify both companiesdeveloping InP processes and to determine the optimal InP structures for the LNA application.  The conclusion is that InP HEMT and MHEMT show state of the art results at 44 GHz.  An industry survey was carried out and 19 companies were identified as havingInP HEMT, InP HBT or MHEMT on their road maps.  Eleven of the 19 are focused on HEMT devices suitable to this LNA application.  Noise and Scattering parameter models were received from one of the foundries and a four stage LNA with 30 dB gain, 1.6 dB noisefigure, and 18mW power dissipation was designed.  This represents a factor or four advantage in power dissipation over GaAs PHEMT.  Additional work carried out include linear and nonlinear device modeling, and simulation and or discussion of 10 additionalLNA circuit topologies that will further improve and enhance LNA performance.  The Phase II program will include the development of a family of multi-function LNAs at 44 GHz.  Beyond the",

By injecting coolant ahead of thecompressor and using its heat of vaporization to cool inlet gasses, the engine can operate at substantially higher velocities without exceeding internal temperature limits.  An additional feature of this process is a significant increase in thrust that canbe used for added acceleration or climb to higher altitudes.  Phase I engine cycle analysis and hardware demonstrations have proven the viability of the MIPCC concept.  A Phase II program is suggested that will demonstrate full-scale MIPCC performanceusing an existing large military jet engine.  This integrated system will be tested under conditions that are representative of those needed to support mission requirements for RASCAL and other high performance aircrafts.  The end result of this effortwill be a preliminary design for a flight-type MIPCC system.\"",

As awareness of the phenomenon improves, reports of PIOs have become more common, and while most such reports indicate mild episodes, the threat of a severe PIO is always present. With increased use of fly-by-wire technology, and with plans for several possible mega-transports, the potential for PIO will only continue to increase. An on-line flight control system monitor that will detect the onset of loss of control due to PIO will enhance flight safety in the 21st century. The real-time monitor looks at input and response states and compares the input/output relationships with known definitions of PIO. A pilot alert system will notify the flight crew that the event is a PIO and assist in decision-making about the criticality of the event. Such a monitor will benefit pre-production testing as well, as it can be used for envelope expansion, quick-look analysis of stability margins, and even for crew training for PIO idenfication.",

The results of past and ongoing U.S. Army and NASA research will be used as a starting point to develop an ACAH stability augmentation system (SAS) that can be used to enhance the dynamics of civil helicopters in a way that is economically viable to the user.The helicopter dynamics required to achieve safe IFR capability are not well understood, so that each certification is a high-risk (and therefore expensive) effort. An important feature of the proposed SAS it that it will provide handling qualities and divided attention characteristics that can be depended on to meet the FAA requirements for IFR certification. The proposed ACAH SAS would provide a low cost solution to achieve improved helicopter dynamics, and hence enhanced safety, in two critical flight regimes, the DVE and for IMC. There is substantial evidence from NTSB accident data to indicate that it is safer to operate IFR than to attempt to continue visual flight in low visibility conditions. However, if it is necessary to operate in the DVE, the ACAH SAS can be shown to substantially improve the safety of that operation",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Honeybee Robotics is proposing a new type of planetary and small bodies sample acquisition and sample handling system that can operate in extreme environments and satisfy crucial mission related science and sample return requirements. Many in-situ instruments are currently only capable of handling small amount of samples (0.1 - 1.0 cc) while missions with sample return requirements have a need for large volume of samples (100-500 cc). The proposed Subsurface Coring Sampler System (SCSS) is capable of acquiring small samples for in-situ science and larger samples for sample return by adjusting the sample volume. Another unique feature of the SCSS is its ability to obtain stratigraphy maintained surface and subsurface cores of varying lengths. Once the cores are obtained, the SCSS can function as precision material handling system, transferring the cores to sample return containers or depositing smaller sections of the cores to in-situ instruments for analysis. This low mass, low power sampling system will be developed with multiple mission applicability in mind, interfacing with a majority of existing in-situ instruments being developed by other NASA centers such as GSFC (CHARGE) and Ames (CIDEX). The SCSS will also be developed with interface commonality to a multi-chamber sample return container currently being developed by Honeybee Robotics for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Researchers at the NIST have demonstrated a programmable Voltage Standard (VS) chip based on SNS (superconductor-normal-superconductor) tunnel junction technology. Excellent programmable voltage standards were demonstrated using this SNS technology in a liquid helium-based system. At HYPRES, we have developed and commercialized a Closed Cycle Refrigerator (CCR)-based DC voltage standard system using a VS chip previously developed and integrated into a liquid helium-based system at NIST. Under the Phase 1 SBIR project, we developed a high performance cryogenic package for the programmable VS chip for integration with a CCR system. This developmental work involved collaborations between NIST and HYPRES to develop the package that was integrated with a NIST-provided CCR. In the Phase 2 program, we will continue to improve the packaging technology and design and implement a flexible cable technology to interface to the chip. In addition, we will procure a CCR system and develop and demonstrate a complete CCR-based programmable VS system. This system, based on a new CCR system developed by Sumitomo, will be compact and portable. The programmable Voltage Standard system has many other applications such as D/A converters and signal synthesizers. Phase 1 established the feasibility of the concept and Phase 2 will lead to a prototype compact system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"Integrated superconducting receivers look very attractive for applications where low noise, weight, power consumption and volume are required. HYPRES proposes to design such a receiver that realizes this improved performance. HYPRES will exploit itsability to produce high quality superconducting (Nb) integrated receivers. This goal will be met by incorporating on one chip such planar components as a SIS (superconductor-isolator-superconductor) mixer with quasioptical antenna, a superconducting localoscillator (LO), an intermediate frequency (IF) SQUID amplifier and the circuits for digitizing of down converted signals and their real time processing. This advanced integrated receiver will focus on digitizing wideband (~2 GHz) signals in the 0-500 GHzrange using a highly tunable long Josephson junction operating in flux-flow mode as a LO and correlator-based versatile digital signal processor circuit. These superconducting integrated circuits will be packaged on a novel cryogenic assembly mounted onsuperconductor multi-chip module (MCM). No other technology may offer this performance with this integration. This project will profit from several concurrent and past DoD-funded projects, such as the 20 GSamples/s ADC (Navy AMRF-C), the 20 Gbpssuperconducting multi-chip module technology (BMDO), the low-pass UHF multi-function digital receiver (ONR), and the 16 GHz correlator developed in BMDO STTR Phase I.\"",

The currentcommutation process is particularly difficult to measure in nested array loads and in concentric magnetic flux compression experiments. Faraday rotation techniques are too insensitive for measurements during the implosion phase. Similarly, the Zeemansplitting of spectrally resolved line profiles are difficult to infer when the Zeeman shift DlZ is much smaller then the absorption line width Dla. HY-Tech proposes to infer the Zeeman splitting from recorded spectra of the right and left circularlypolarized s components. The spectra are recorded while viewing the plasma along the field direction using a polarimeter to spatially separate the two circular components at the input slit of the spectrometer. Radially or axially resolved spectra with a 1mm resolution at 10 spatial locations will be used to study the R-T instability and current commutation during the implosion phase.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose to develop a programming environment that will greatly simplify the development of natural, cooperative natural language interfaces to complex systems. As flight operations and flight crews interact with larger numbers of complex and semi-autonomous systems, it is imperative that less demanding, more cooperative interfaces be developed. However, creating such interfaces is difficult. We believe these difficulties can be overcome by cleanly separating the complex language issues such as noun phrase resolution and dialog management, from the simpler issues ofdescribing the components of the system. Such a separation is made possible by defining broad Conversational Interface Domains (CIDs) that incorporate expert algorithms and heuristics for processing language within the domain. Thus, the interface programmer need only describe the specific objects, actions, and relationships that make up the application behind the interface. We believe that CIDs will significantly lower the cost and development time of effective, conversational interfaces. We plan to create a stable, commercial-grade version of a CID software engine and development system. The engine will run on hand-held wireless devices (PDAs) and allow distributed, conversational interaction to other CID-enabled devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is development of a multiplexed, portable real time evanescent fiber optic sensor instrument for quantifying the amount of specific DNA in a sample. During Phase I of this project, IA demonstrated the feasibility of monitoring DNA hybridization in real time using an evanescent fiber-optic DNA biosensor with fluorescence detection. The DNA biosensor was mounted within a temperature controlled reaction chamber. DNA sequences were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridized to specific probes immobilized to the DNA biosensor surface. During Phase II, IA will develop a multiplexed DNA Biosensor Fluorometer capable of simultaneously monitoring the hybridization occurring on eight or more DNA biosensors at a time. The increased sensitivity associated with evanescent sensing will allow detection of one DNA copy after 25-30 cycles. The small size of the instrument and associated sample prep cartridge will adapt it to point of care testing for pathogen identification.   Specific Aim 1 provides for incorporation into the instrumental methods, use of a probe for an internal PCR standard for normalization of the efficiency of each individual reaction. Specific Aim 2 provides a multiplexed sensor cartridge so that each cartridge can run eight samples simultaneously. Specific Aim 3 provides comparison of performance of the prototype instrument with established methods using plasmids containing sequences which are specific for HPV 16 or for Chiamydia trachomatis.   A specialized cartridge for sample preparation will be developed under Specific Aim 4. This will allow biological samples of clinical interest to be prepared for PCR without the need of a centrifuge. Sample will be applied to the top of the cartridge and reagents will be pressed through with a syringe. DNA will be eluted ready for amplification in the easily portable sensor instrument. PCR will be performed in situ in the sensor cartridge while the instrument records the rate of hybridization for eight solutions and standards. This will provide for a control sample and a standard curve over an anticipated seven log range.   The system can be adapted to a variety of amplification formats, and has the potential for use in genetics research laboratories and for clinical determinations in hospital labs. It will provide an instrument and sample preparation method uniquely adapted to point of care testing for pathogens in a short period of time.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         To build lower-cost and more-capable aerospace vehicles that are based on multifunctional structure and sensor systems necessitates innovative concepts and designs for assessment, test, and validation of design integrity. This, in turn, calls for a broadening of the tool set through the introduction of new kinds of design and analysis methods. To respond to this need, the proposed SBIR effort is intended to develop the Risk Assessment and Management Environment (RAME). As envisioned by Mr. Goldin, the Director of NASA, failure reports, maintenance actions, and operational experience should be tracked by tools and be used to update analytical models and data/knowledge bases in order to better predict future system performance and risk. Accordingly, RAME is intended to become a supervisory system that enforces design for safety and mission success, and enables learning from prior experiences. Unlike traditional analysis tools that play a passive role for system evaluation, RAME aims for actively escorting a system to undergo design, development, operation, and maintenance. Moreover, while its primary goal is to validate a system, RAME will facilitate validation of mathematical models, in terms of cause-effect relations, parameter values, etc., and thus be able to offer convincing risk-assessment results and risk-management recommendations.",

This system will provide the foundation for           clinical implementation of Ichor's proprietary therapy, which has shown promise      for treatment of solid tumors in the pancreas, head & neck, liver, and brain.        Preclinical studies performed by Ichor confirmed data reported in the                literature characterize the cytotoxic effects of EPT. However, these studies         also suggest that, unlike traditional EPT approaches, unique features of this        therapy make it highly selective for malignant cells. Thus, the technology           potentially offers a method of treatment for locally advanced tumors with            margins that extend into surrounding tissues.                                                                                                                             Feasibility of the proposed EPT system will be established by designing,             constructing, and testing a microprocessor-based switching apparatus. This           system will directly control delivery of electroporation pulses to an electrode      array implanted in the patient. Research will focus on the components,               architecture, and control system best suited for safe application of the unique      electrical signals characteristic of electroporation. After feasibility has          been confirmed, integration of the switching apparatus with pulse generation         and control means will provide an EPT system appropriate for multi-center            clinical studies and eventual commercial use.                                        PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Electroporation Therapy with bleomycin (EPT-B) has potential as a locoregional treatment for  both primary and secondary tumors.  In both preclinical and early phase clinical studies,   EPT-B has shown significant anti-tumor effect in a variety of tumor types.  It appears that  EPT-B could be clinically appropriate for several cancers including head & neck, pancreatic,  liver, and brain.  The proposed research will focus on the development of an Electroporation  Therapy system appropriate for commercial clinical use.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Real-time PCR has greatly improved the          ease, accuracy and precision of quantitative PCR by allowing reaction kinetics       to be observed, measured and recorded as PCR is occurring. We have successfully      commercialized the LightCycler, a real-time PCR instrument that combines a           rapid thermal cycler with a fluorimeter. We have developed sequence specific         probe systems that rely on fluorescent signal to detect PCR product. These           hybridization probes can also be used to detect polymorphisms after PCR by           probe melting. In phase I, we combined a method of competitive quantitative          end-point PCR with the ability of hybridization probes to differentiate single       nucleotide polymorphisms by probe melting temperature. We also developed a           mathematical method of melting curve analysis that can be used to quantify           allele frequencies in heterogeneous samples. This analytical method can              accurately quantify allele frequencies as low as 1 percent in pooled samples.        This method has great potential in the area of high throughput Single                Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis. In particular, quantification of allele      frequencies in pooled samples for disease association studies, quantification        of allelic patterns of gene transcription, and quantification of mutation load.      In phase II, we propose to develop a commercial instrument and analysis              software for quantitative melting curve analysis using a standard 384-well           microplate format. The proposed instrument is not a thermal cycler. Instead it       will analyze PCR products generated on any 384-well PCR thermocycler by              hybridization probe melting. This strategy will result in a low-cost,                quantitative instrument that is compatible with standard high-throughput PCR         instruments and automated workstations commonly used in many labs.                   Instrumentation and analysis software will be validated by high throughput           quantification of mutant-to-wildtype mitochondrial allele frequencies in             individuals harboring variable loads of mitochondrial disease muations.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Idaho Technology is looking to expand into the growing field of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis. We recognize the need for high throughput capabilities that are compatible with other PCR thermocyclers and automated DNA workstations. We propose to bring to market an instrument that offers these features, and incorporates quantitative features not currently available with other methods of SNP analysis.",

It has been deployed throughout the Air Force and other branches of the military with a highlevel of operational success.  Typical PCR methods used with the RAPID are tied to complex wet chemistry more suitable for the laboratory than field environments.  Our Phase I effort was directed at demonstrating that these reagents can be produced in afreeze-dried, stable format, allowing sensitive PCR methods to be used in non-laboratory environments and significantly increasing the ease of use of the RAPID system.  We have successfully shown the feasibility of producing reagents in a freeze-dried formwith extended stability and no loss of performance. Idaho Technology is now in a position to provide the Air Force with a complete system that includes both the chemistry and the instrumentation required for monitoring biowarfare agents in any environment.The tasks outlined in the Phase II effort will improve upon the foundations laid down in Phase I by developing methods for scale-up of the process, and implementing a quality system that will be necessary for eventual commercialization.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The overall objective of our Phase II research program is to produce a prototype that utilizes this method to deacidify paper, and prevent ongoing, in-situ acid degradation that is rendering it unstable. The workflow can be divided into 1) Mission and 2)Technical Objectives. Mission Objectives:The Library of Congress (LOC) provided the mission objectives for a successful MD treatment in 1990 by issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) detailing five required performance criteria for an acceptable MD process. Those RFP criteria have been widely adopted and are summarized below: 1.The process must be demonstrated as effective for mass deacidification. 2.The scientific soundness and safety of the process must be substantiated throughout with supporting data. 3.The process must add to the necessary alkaline reserve, treat substrates uniformly and not cause damage to the paper or bound volumes treated. 4.The process must demonstrate satisfactory levels of quality assurance. 5.The process must provide documentation of appropriate inventory and tracking techniques for documents undergoing treatment. Potential users have added criteria, which must be met by a process that is acceptable to their preservation department or institution as summarized below: A.The process must be economically feasible for mass deacidification. B.The process should be applicable for all materials without risk of damage to bindings, paper or ink. C.The successful process must be capable of being carried out in-house by resident library personnel without the presence of extraneous hazardous chemicals or processes and without the necessity of exotic equipment or utilities.Technical Objectives:Most of the work on technical objectives will take place using a scaled-up prototype for the paper treating process. These include: 1.Development of real-scale equipment to study the application variables of the MD process as an aid in the engineering process and to assist in its commercialization. 2.Increased understanding of treatment parameters as well as the optimization of treating formulations. 3.Development and control of a method to uniformly apply treating formulation. 4.Increase in the effectiveness of the treatments. 5.Continued research into the effects of treatments on the properties of treated paper utilizing accepted physical testing protocols and Scanning Electron Microscopy with visual and energy dispersive X-Ray characterizations. The technology above includes development, integration and proof testing of necessary prototype components and sub-systems. This will supply a satisfactory device for treating of single sheets of paper.",

The project has six objectives: (a) improve process control of the Plasma-sphere production system, (b) produce Plasma-spheres with optimum properties and characteristics, (d) develop reliable microsphere-electrode configurations, (e) develop a semi-automated process for fabricating Plasma-sphere panels, (f) construct and evaluate prototype plasma-sphere panels, and (g) determine techniques for a fully automated production process. The Plasma-spheres will be produced with a prototype production system built in Phase I. The Plasma-sphere panels will be characterized for operating voltages, current and brightness. As part of the prototype panel construction a reliable method of applying the Plasma-spheres to substrates will be developed. The use of Plasma-spheres will dramatically increase manufacturing throughput, reduce materials cost by half, and eliminate many process steps and expensive specialized machinery which are part of the current plasma panel technology. These cost reductions along with new applications which will result from the availability of an open flexible substrate (e.g., large conformal and panoramic displays), will provide Plasma-sphere panels with a significant competitive edge",

Structural characterization of nano-biotechnology devices is currently problematic because available microscopy and analytical techniques have substantial limitations in quantitative imaging at the atomic-scale. Moreover, current microscopy techniques cannot adequately resolve three-dimensional biomacromolecules, which are intrinsic to nano-biotechnology devices. Until better analytical instrumentation is developed, researchers will \"fly blind\" as they develop more complex nano-biotechnology devices. The overall goal of this Phase II project is to rapidly analyze the three-dimensional atomic-scale structure and elemental composition of biological and organic molecules on nano-biotechnology devices. The focus will be on developing technologies to  analyze commercial specimens using LEAP technology, and to initiate commercialization and marketing of this technology to academic and industrial researchers.\r      The commercial application of this project will be in the area of bioanalytical instrumentation and nano-biotechnology devices.",

Results from the Phase I program demonstrated that nanopore membranes can effectively immunologically protect xenograft insulin producing cells suspended in a matrix by allowing passage of glucose, nutrients and insulin while restricting entry of immunoglobulins and other components that may attack and destroy insulin producing cells. The Phase II program will develop a prototype implant suitable for preclinical testing in small and large animal models, if successful, this implant promises to replace insulin injections with an implant containing islet cells that produce insulin in response to the patients demands, maintaining normal levels of blood glucose. Unlike other islet cell transplantation, this approach can make use of a potentially large supply of islet cells from pigs or human stem cells without the need for any immunosuppressive therapy. The implant will keep transplanted islet cells sequestered from the recipient's immune system. It will be durable, rechargeable and, if problems develop, removable.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major health problem affecting nearly 1.5 million people every year. The reduction of sex hormone levels in both men and women increase production of certain factors that lead to osteoporosis. One-third of all menopausal women experience at least one osteoporotic fracture during their lifetime. In addition, certain malignancies, including breast, prostrate, or lung frequently metastasize to long bones, spinal vertebrae, and/or pelvis. Primary and metastatic cancers involving bone account for approximately 400,000 new cancer cases per year in the United States alone, and >70% of patients with advanced breast or prostate cancer have skeletal metastases. Ongoing osteoclastic activity appears to be involved in the generation and maintenance of ongoing and movement-evoked pain. Recently, several protein factors, such as RANK, RANKL, and OPG have been identified that are important in the pathogenesis of disease. RANKL by binding to cell surface receptor RANK on the osteoclastic precursor cells induce formation of osteoclasts, which are involved in bone resorption. Administration of OPG (which acts as decoy receptor for RANKL) has been shown to halt further bone destruction, reduce a ongoing and movement-evoked pain. Blockade of ongoing osteoclast activity of RANKL by inhibitory molecules have the potential to reduce bone cancer pain in patients with advanced tumor-induced bone destruction. Since OPG/RANKL ratio play an important role osteoclast development, it is important to monitor the levels of RANKL and OPG in patients' blood circulation. In this Phase II study, using monoclonal antibodies, we propose to develop sensitive assays to measure OPG and RANKL in blood stream. We also propose to develop monoclonal antibodies that can neutralize RANKL activity in the development of osteoclasts, These monoclonal antibodies will have therapeutic application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Gynecologists have traditionally employed blind procedures such as dilatation and curettage (D&C;) for intra-uterine diagnosis and treatment. More recently, they have begun to use hysteroscopic techniques, with a camera and operating instruments insert4d into the uterus through the cervix. Being able to see inside the uterus allows experienced surgeons to work more effectively, with fewer complications; however, operating with instruments inserted through the narrow cervical canal places great demands on surgeons' skill and dexterity. Hysteroscopic surgery can even increase complication rates, especially for surgeons inexperienced with hysteroscopy. The simulator developed in Phase I and proposed for extension in Phase II will allow surgeons to learn in a standardized environment with low instructional costs, built-in performance evaluation, no patient risk, and varied pathologies determined by a curriculum, not by the random flow of patients. Phase I produced a prototype simulator for the common hysteroscopy tasks-cervical dilation, endometrial ablation, and polyp extraction. Here distinguished surgical educators evaluated the simulator, providing validation and guidance for Phase II. The Phase II will include instructional design and implementation of three training software modules, custom interface hardware development, and simulator evaluations, resulting in a refined simulator ready for delivery to customers.",

Structured evaluation will help guide and validate system development and validation.Proposed technical advances include using Immersion's patented haptic computer mouse to simulate detection and recognition of arterial pulses; developing a virtual needle that floats freely in space and provides multi-axis tactile force feedback to theuser; simulating the experience of striking bone (clavicle) with the needle; rendering and modeling relevant tracks of the human venous system; advancement of the software framework to allow customization of didactic elements, including institutionalpolicy, procedural flow, and tool parameters; and creation on 20 virtual patient cases. An Immersion Medical simulator for CVC would allow users to effectively increase their patient volume, thereby benefiting healthcare by reducing patient complications and their related costs. The proposed simulator would also be a valuable training toolfor the U.S. military, where central lines placement is a required element of requisite Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) and Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) training. Implementation of the proposed technology would bolster medical support to thewounded soldier through enhanced medical training. In success, the proposed project will improve military readiness through shortened recovery times, and will lead to the production of commercially viable products with educational and training benefits forU.S. hospitals and medical schools.

Various corroborating D&P; technologies from different engineering disciplines, including oil analysis, vibration/thermal analysis and rotordynamic modeling, have been integrated together under a Phase I demonstrationusing automated reasoning and intelligent data fusion algorithms.  Based on these successful results, continued development and implementation of this integrated approach will be applied to bearings from various AFRL engine test rigs, as well as OEMsupported tests including a Rolls Royce AE 1107C engine and a GE Y120 counter rotating bearing application (both GE and RR have provided in-kind contributions to support these tests).  Through intelligent fusion of the health monitoring data andmodel-based techniques demonstrated in Phase I, a comprehensive component prognostic capability will be achieved, using model-based estimates when no diagnostic indicators are present and monitored features such as oil debris and vibration at later stageswhen failure indications are detectable.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Ultrasound imaging has long been the preferred modality for diagnostic evaluation of acute physiological conditions. However, current B-scan ultrasound, based on a fan of echoes, is very difficult to understand and requires specialized training to interpret. In this program, we propose to develop a speckle-free ultrasound imaging system which is low power, low cost, and can be made in a handheld format. The images generated from this system are striking for their radiographic appearance and lack of unwanted ultrasound artifacts. The system could be used to diagnose a variety of acute conditions as well as guide therapies during surgery. The solution proposed by Imperium is based on a proprietary 2-D monolithic integrated array in which a piezoelectric material is deposited on a CMOS integrated circuit, much like an infrared imaging array. The lens-based device produces video quality images which unlike current ultrasound systems, requires no special training to interpret. The proposed solution is a high resolution, real-time, speckle-free, portable, ruggedized camera which will allow for a Crew Medical Officer (CMO) to immediately diagnose internal features and organs. Alternatively, the device could be used to assess the air bubbles in the bloodstream both during and after space flights.",

In Phase I, Implant Sciences outlined a program to produce an instrument meeting these requirements and, in the course of executing it, proved the detection principal on which the instrument is based and demonstrated the miniaturizationtechnology necessary to compress multi-gas measurements into a pocket-sized package.  Phase II proposes to build on this work and bridge from it to a prototype matrix-sensor package suitable for evaluation as a survivability assessment tool.  To assistwith practical aspects of packaging sensors into detector ensembles and to expedite the effort by employing, to the greatest extent possible, modified versions of commercial instrument packages, the Company is joined in Phase II by Detcon Inc., anestablished supplier of toxic-gas-detecting instruments.

These explosive charges are then ignited to push the overburden into a previously excavated trench. This Phase II project will complete the design, fabrication, and testing of a prototype detonation system to be deployed in surface mining boreholes to preferentially initiate detonation of the powder column, thus insuring a high efficiency blast without the unwanted release of toxic air pollutants. This project will lead to commercialization of a method of improving the efficiency and environmental quality of the cast blasting technique used by the surface mining. The market for this detonation system is any mining that involves cast blasting, primarily the surface coal mining industry.

This website will allow students to receive empirically-based information in a confidential manner, acknowledging their desire for self-help methods. Phase II will involve finalizing the content, interface, and interactive features of the website through discussions with an advisory group of college peer educators and consultation with tobacco experts. We will produce a prototype website and field test it in comparison to a control website consisting of standard text-based tobacco information. Finally, we will gather satisfaction data from participating students and acceptance feedback from health professionals at participating colleges.",

Court mandated parenting education programs have become increasingly commonplace in recent years. Although these programs are enjoying widespread national support, a number of problems with them nave been identified, including lack of tailoring, inadequate follow-up, limited accessibility, inconsistent delivery, insensitivity to domestic violence, and minimal experimental evaluation. As part of a larger NIDA-funded suite of parenting education programs currently under development at Inflexxion, KidCare for Co-Parents is designed to address these known limitations.  The program will consist of an interactive, multimedia-based parenting education curriculum, a companion Website, and a take-home handbook. Phase I involved proof of concept research to demonstrate product feasibility. Phase II will involve production and usability testing of a fully functional KidCare for Co-Parents, as well as a field test and acceptance study to compare program efficacy and satisfaction levels relative to currently mandated parenting education options.  If proven effective, court-systems and parents alike would likely view KidCare for Co-Parents as a desirable and cost-effective means of reducing the well-known risks associated with divorce and other forms of parental separation.",

Managers increasingly face demands to use client data to improve quality of care. The website provides tools to create a database of data from managers' own facilities to generate useful descriptions of their facility data and to make comparisons between their data and national data. The goal is realistically make available to all managers the tools and knowledge to integrate client data into their management planning and decision-making. The website includes a Web-based course to help managers learn to use clinical data for system change. The course will feature Addiction Severity Index (ASI) data, analytic concepts, and clinical decision-making. Phase I developed and tested initial feasibility of product concept and created a demo website. Also, a national comparison database of 27,000 cases was assembled. In Phase II, the final website will be produced. An analogue field trial will examine, in contrast to a written booklet and wait-list control, the website's effectiveness in facilitating managers to more use of clinical data in decision-making.",

STAP offers the potential to detect slow moving ground vehicles that would otherwise be obscured by strong background clutter for systems employingconventional beamforming.  In high target density environments, however, the radar data used to train the STAP algorithm will generally contain returns from ground vehicles causing the adaptive algorithm to cancel targets of interest as well as the groundclutter.  The focus of the proposed research is to develop STAP algorithms that are robust to the problems associated with vehicles in the training data.  The proposed algorithms will be tested using both ISL's site-specific radar simulation capabilitiesas well as experimental GMTI radar data.  Implementation issues including computational complexity will be addressed under the proposed program.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate a capability for locating imperiled firefighters in buildings using wireless technology based on long wavelength signals that penetrate buildings with lower perturbation than observed at higher frequencies. The system is being developed for firefighters (estimated 5 year market of over $150 million) but is useful for any application requiring geolocation in buildings where GPS cannot work. Such applications include tracking personnel and equipment in crisis situations, military combat, inventory management and police and military training. This concept has significant advantages over competing technologies; ultra-wideband solutions pose frequency licensing problems, and man-portable inertial units are bulky, costly and have significant time-dependent errors. \r \r The Wireless Firefighter Lifeline (WFL) system is completely mobile and supports multiple firefighters. It complies with Part 15 rules and will not require FCC licenses. Phase II will demonstrate the underlying technology over a wide range of conditions and will produce a prototype system that will serve as the baseline for future system development. It provides extensive commercial and societal benefit, offers performance superior to that of other potential technologies, and is well positioned to attract further funding.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this Phase II program is to complete the development of a commercializable solid state nanopore device for the accurate high speed sequencing of DNA. To achieve this goal a manufacturable device must be designed and fabrication processes established that result in a unit with extremely small, well controlled diameter orifices of approximately 2 nm through a multi-layered thin film sandwich of insulators and conductors.      The Phase I portion of this program established the methodology of: creating a thin (30 nm) SiN film over a 20 um square window in a 1 cm square silicon frame; Focused Ion Beam (FIB) milling a nanopore; subsequent deposition of a multi-layer thinfilm sandwich of conductor and insulating layers on the surface of SiN film; and building a cartridge to hold and seal the nanopore chip between two liquid cells, and provide electrical terminations for measuring the changes in current, potential, or capacitance resulting in the passage of a DNA molecule chain through the nanopore.      It was found that FIB milling produced a nanopore that was too wide and lacked the required sensitivity to map DNA molecules passing through the nanopore.. A new approach, TEM drilling will be used to achieve nanopores of 2 nm or smaller. Additional work will be invested in optimizing the leads and instrumentation, i.e., patch clamp amplifiers to achieve improved signal-to-noise ratios and increased detection sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Phase I work has demonstrated the fabrication of a thin, strong, lightweight composite material that could be scaled up from the laboratory to industrial pilot quantities. The phase I material shows no breakthrough flux of mustard and nerve agents (HD and GB) (actual chemical warfare agents) for over 48 hrs, which exceeds the current 8hrs criteria for suits, as verified by an Army certified laboratory.   The composition presents a powerful self-decontaminating, triple defense concept- Chemical agent deactivation, barrier effect and biocidal effect. In addition the material is moisture vapor permeable (breathable) but not air permeable. The biocidal activities of the composites against Anthrax surrogate Bacillus var. niger spores and Anthrax spores were firmly established. Typically 4-5 log reductions (total kill) were noted when the samples were exposed to Anthrax, Bacillus spores and other pathogens. The capacity to kill over 70 million anthrax spores! 50 cm2 of the phase I material was recorded.   The phase II would concentrate on optimizing the assembly of the membrane to an outer shell fabric. The optimization of the thickness, composition, and production parameters will be done. Quantitative kill kinetic curves for aerosolized Anthrax spores and certain viral and bacterial species will be established. The deactivation of chemical agent kinetics and resistance to aerosol penetration will be demonstrated. A reputable team of experts from the Army laboratories and textile industry has been assembled to carry out all the qualifying tests for such a material. The protection factor offered by these suits will be characterized by the Army materials laboratory. Commercial partners have been identified.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The market size for the protective clothing for civilians, police, medical personnel and fire fighters for domestic preparedness is expected to be 2 billion dollars by year 2004. ICET's market share is estimated to be about 200 million dollars five years after commercial entry.",

Associated pathologies (Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever, Dengue Shock Syndrome) result in >20,000 deaths annually, primarily in children. Dengue virus is endemic to tropical/subtropical regions, with high incidence rates in developing countries. Currently, no specific treatments or vaccines are available. Moreover, rapid, sensitive and specific diagnostics are lacking. Antibody ELISA tests lack specificity and require a host immune response; tissue culture assays require specialized laboratories and long incubation times. Phase I of this SBIR demonstrated the feasibility of linking a simple nucleic acid isolation technology to an isothermal method of nucleic acid amplification and a liposome-microchip biosensor detection technology for the clinical detection/subtyping of Dengue virus. This technology linkage permits specific and sensitive detection of Dengue infection in patients within 5 hours, has minimal equipment requirements, and can be provided at costs compatible with endemic area economies. Phase II proposes continued development/optimization of this assay system. Phase I design specifications will be used to produce and validate a prototype assay, produced in Jab batch quantities. Identified design and production modifications will be implemented to produce pilot batch lots of the assay that will be validated and clinically evaluated.",

The opportunity in this program is to develop a conventional generator system, which will favorably compete with asuper-conducting system both in terms of size and weight, while being less complicated and significantly less expensive. A generator that will have continuous output of 400-500 kW, to support a microwave based directed energy system, could provide powerbursts of up to 1.0 MW and support also (but not simultaneously) a laser system.  IPS and Lockheed-Martin are currently working on developing a system consisting of a low duty cycle 1.O MW generator that can operate continuously at 500 KW.During Phase II, IPS intends to design and build a generator based on the technology developed throughout Phase I and II.

In the proposed program, the repetition rate will be increased, switching stability improved and a prototype switching system developed. The second switch program, complementing the first, is based on thepseudospark switch, which has demonstrated very high voltage switching at 20 nsec rise times and kA current pulses. It is proposed to increase its lifetime, possibly using multiple discharges, repetition rate and improve triggerability.

To address this need, Inotek is developing a series of novel anti-colitic agents that detoxify peroxynitrite, a potent oxidant formed in the intestinal mucosa of\r ulcerative colitis and Crohn?s Disease. Using a murine dextran sulfate model of enterocolitis, we have determined that our lead peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst, FP15, profoundly reduced bloody diarrhea, gross and microscopic histologic injury, lipid peroxidation, and weight loss and increased colon length and survival. In the Phase II SBIR, we intend to demonstrate that the in\r vivo toxicologic profile of FP15 meets FDA standards for progression to clinical studies. Specific Aim #1: Kilogram level production of FP15. Pre-clinical evaluation of FP15, including toxicology, metabolism, and pharmacokinetic studies, requires process scale-up to produce kilogram scale\r GLP-grade material. Specific Aim #2: Determine the in vivo pharmacokinetics, distribution, bioavailabllity, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of FP15 in rats and canines. Specific Aim #3: Determine the biochemical, hematologic, and histopathologic toxicology profile of FP15. Definitive chronic toxicity studies wifi provide a comprehensive behavioral, biochemical, and histopathologic profile These studies will provide the foundation for clinical testing,\r commercial development, and first market entry of an ultrapotent peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst for therapy of IBD.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A recently discovered mechanism of cell injury, the \"Poly (ADP-ribose) Synthetase (PARS) pathway\" has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuronal injury. Triggered by oxidant-induced DNA single strand breaks, PARS catalyzes an energy-consuming polymerization of ADP-ribose, resulting in NAD depletion, inhibition of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, and the ultimate reduction of intracellular high-energy phosphates, which culminates in neuro injury. The applicants are developing novel classes of compounds with neuroprotective potential. In this proposal, we present evidence that PARS knockout animals, and animals treated with various classes of novel PARS inhibitors PJ34 are resistant against brain trauma. We also present preliminary data with PJ34, a novel, water-soluble, ultrapotent PARS inhibitor.  Inotek's mid-term intention is to develop an ultrapotent PARS inhibitor of the PJ class as a drug for the treatment of neural injury associated with various forms of CNS trauma. The specific aim of the present proposal is to synthesize novel PARS inhibitors, screen them for efficacy and toxicity in vitro and in vivo, and then to perform definitive in vivo studies with selected lead candidates in murine models of brain and spinal cord trauma. In vivo studies will also define the dose-response relationship, frequency of administration, and the therapeutic window. Finally, a single lead compound candidate will be selected, which will undergo formal preclinical safety and pharmacokinetic studies. By the end of a 2-year project, the applicants will be prepared to undertake a human Phase I safety trial with a selected ultrapotent PARS inhibitor with promise of efficacy in CNS trauma.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The annual domestic impact of brain and spinal cord trauma on the health care market  is estimated at >$750 million.  The worldwide market is four times larger.  Given the absence of a specific, safe, and convenient existing therapy, Inotek anticipates market acceptance to be achieved rapidly, at high levels of penetration, and with a high sustained price point ($1000 per patient).  Estimated worldwide revenues after market entry and maturation (ca. 4 years after FDA approval)=$750 million (annual).",

Traditional commercial receiver techniques require that virtually all communications systems operatingparameters, such as signaling constellations, carrier frequencies, channel characteristics, and pulse shapes be known.  However, in military surveillance applications, these operating parameters are not available, and so must be estimated blindly.We propose to research and develop algorithms for blind detection, identification, and demodulation of communication signals.  In particular, we will examine detection of low probability of intercept spread spectrum signals; modulation format recognition;blind demodulation of the identified signal; and wideband signal processing issues.The algorithms we will provide to Army CECOM will be developed and implemented in C and Matlab.  We will demonstrate their use through omputer simulations of blind demodulation scenarios or on ponsor-directed applications.  We will provide research reportsdescribing the background and uses of the algorithms as well as the imulation results.  For the Army, this technology will provide urveillance capabilities for existing and planned software-defined radios such as the Joint Tactical Radio System and thecommunications infrastructure for the Future Combat Systems program.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This SBIR Phase II research project proposes to develop user-friendly component software for classical econometric estimation and inference based on simulation methods, such as maximum simulated likelihood, method of simulated moments, and efficient method of moments. In the last decade different simulation-based methods have been developed to tackle complex economic/statistical models which cannot be estimated by conventional methods such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Although these simulation-based estimators have desirable theoretical properties, they have remained as research topics in academia and have not become useful tools for practitioners because of the lack of user friendly software. Building upon the Phase I research and development, Insightful (formerly MathSoft) plans to study two classes of models: mixed logit models for discrete choice analysis which represent cross sectional and panel data problems, and models for term structure of interest rates which represent discrete time and continuous time structural models. Extensive Monte Carlo experiments will be used to explore finite sample properties of various aspects of simulation, estimation and forecasting, with an aim of improving and stabilizing the current algorithms. The user-friendly component software will be developed using both object oriented S-Plus language and the state-of-art JavaBean technology, and it will provide intuitive graphical user interface. The S-Plus functions of the technology proffered by Insightful for econometric estimation and inference will serve the purpose of quickly gaining a broad user base, while the JavaBeans can be used to develop custom applications. The software will help economists and practitioners in other fields such as the financial industry, social sciences, and biotechnology to conduct flexible and extensible model estimation and inference.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Functional data arise in many fields of medical research, with examples from studies of growth patterns, gait, melanoma incidence rates, CD4 counts and many other areas. Indeed, any set of measurements gathered over time (or space), including time dependent covariates in survival analysis, may be thought of as functional data. There are many advantages of viewing such data as functions rather than disconnected points, perhaps the most important being the ability to routinely including derivative information into the analysis. Historically, functional data has been analyzed using multi-variate or time series methods, but these methods do not work well for irregularly spaced data or data measured at different times for different subjects. Recent advances make it possible to analyze such data as functions Here we propose to implement an S-Plus module for functional data analysis. This module will e a commercial implementation of the exploratory methods developed by Ramsay and Silverman (1997), with many extensions, including new methods for generalized linear models, survival analysis, and non-linear least square models, and extension to functions with different bases. The new module will seamlessly integrate functional data analysis methods into S-Plus.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract verbatim): Identification and segmentation of      the constituent parts of a human brain in three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic           resonance imaging (MRI) studies is a starting point for much of the current          research into human brain structure and function. Accurate segmentation and          registration allows clinicians and researchers to track and measure changes in       the brain over time. Manual brain morphometry is a laborious and time consuming      task. The voluminous amount of data and the specialized knowledge required to        manually analyze a human brain image preclude clinical studies from rapidly          moving forward. In order to address this problem, we propose the creation of a       commercial software package that would register and normalize a subject's brain      image to a digital atlas of neuroanatomy as well as rigidly align two brain          images. Anatomic labels identified on the atlas can then be automatically            mapped to segment the corresponding structures in the registered subject image.      Normalizing to an atlas allows measurements of brain structure and function          from a group of subjects to be compared with respect to the reference space          established by the atlas. Rigid alignment of two brain images allows the             detection of changes in longitudinal studies. Our software will also provide         tools for region-of-interest analysis. We believe that the ability to                automatically make structural and functional measurements and to detect changes      in the brain is a major advantage of our approach.                                   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  There is no commercial software available that allows 3-D MR brain images to be  automatically registered to an atlas, along with performing atlas-derived measurements.  Our software would fill a niche in the conduct of brain imaging studies in the pharmaceutical  industry and address the needs of academic researchers.  Part of our commercialization  plan will be to provide a brain mapping service for customers who require standardized  protocols or who cannot afford to access the necessary resources in terms of personnel,  software, hardware, and training.  These customers would securely transmit their MRI brain  data to MathSoft over the Internet for processing and receive the output electronically.  This  technology can be extended to the segmentation of other parts of the body.  Another  commercially attractive direction for future application of this software is screening and  characterization for animal imaging studies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this proposal is to improve the effectiveness of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) in diagnosing and treating prostate diseases. Prostate boundaries in TRUS images provide the anatomical description needed for diagnosis, for treatment planning, and for follow-up. Our proposed research enables computer aided prostate delineation using \"just-enough interaction\" with the expert.   In phase I, we have embedded several segmentation algorithms within a software environment allowing interaction with the physicians. The variability in (semi-)automated prostate delineation compared to manual delineation was reduced by half. Also, the delineation time compared to manual outlining was reduced by a factor of 2.   Based on the feedback from several companies and end-users, who have shown interest in our technology, we find that in the past year, emerging intraoperative clinical procedures and post-treatment monitoring techniques have necessitated further automation and generated the need for prostate specific multimodality image registration algorithms. In phase II, we aim to further reduce human interaction in prostate delineation without compromising on algorithm performance by developing and validating more advanced segmentation algorithms. We will automate post-implant monitoring by segmenting the prostate from post-implant TRUS images by developing advanced segmentation and registration algorithms. We will validate the algorithms on large clinical dataset. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Our technology is of great interest to vendors of prostate cancer treatment planning systems, be it in the area of prostate brachyltherapy or in prostate cryotherapy. The movement of radiation treatment planning systems to inter-operative settings make automated delineation technology even more valuable to these vendors. This technology is also of interest to manufacturers of ultrasound machines.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The provision of assistive technology (AT) to people with disabilities is encouraged in a succession of U.S. statutes and health-related professionals say they require and want an effective process for matching person and technology. A good match takes into account the environments in which the AT will e used, user needs and preferences, and technology functions and features. If the match is poor from the user's standpoint, the AT may not be used, or will not be used optimally. An assessment process exists which may have been effective in organizing the influences impacting AT use: the Matching Person & Technology (MPT) Model and assessment instruments. The aims of this project are to develop, validate and commercialize two products: (a) a series of interpretive guidelines for consumer responses to the MPT assessments and (b) an interactive training program designed to address the MPT assessment and ET educational needs of rehabilitation professionals.  The methodology involves (a) product development (including translation into Spanish), (b) pilot testing the products by new users (professionals and consumers in vocational and medical rehabilitation facilities) and making needed revisions, and (c) product validation and evaluation. At the conclusion of Phase II, the products will be produced and commercialized. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The development and testing of the interactive training program and interpretive guidelines will result in products for professionals serving persons with mobility disabilities from a variety of cultural backgrounds and in a variety of settings from acute rehabilitation. Upon validation, these products can be distributed privately through existing publishers of interactive instruction and assessments and promoted by relevant professional organizations.",

P. pastoris is also a model system used to investigate certain areas of eukaryotic cell biology, such asperoxisome biogenesis and degradation, and Golgi organization. The goals of this project are: (1) to determine, with high fidelity, the DNA sequence of the genome of P. pastoris by a combination of \"shot-gun\" sequencing and \"primer-walking\" gap closing;(2) to annotate the expected 6,000 plus ORFs; (3) to develop a publicly accessible web site dedicated to the dissemination of information on the sequencing and annotation results; (4) to construct and make available DNA microarrays focused on ~500 P.pastoris genes whose expression is relevant to recombinant protein production; and (5) to construct certain modified P. pastoris strains for improved production of recombinant proteins.  The sequencing, assembly, and preliminary gene annotation work willbe performed by Integrated Genomics (IG), an experienced microbial sequencing and analysis company. The hosting of the web site, DNA microarray, and host strain constructions will be performed at the Keck Graduate Institute (KGI).  KGI is a new educationaland research institution focusing on bioinformatics and genomics technologies. The availability of the DNA sequence of the P. pastoris genome with associated materials and information as proposed in this application will be of enormous benefit to the manycommercial and academic researchers utilizing this novel but important yeast.  Because of the similarity in amino acid sequence between most P. pastoris proteins and their Saccharomyces cerevisiae counterparts, much of the great wealth of informationgenerated over the years for S. cerevisiae genes and products will be transferred directly to those of P. pastoris.  Users of P. pastoris will be able to rapidly identify genes of interest and, in conjunction with PCR methodology, have these genes in handfor further study literally overnight.  Thus",

This system will enhance current physical-aperture MTI capability in two ways: 1.)By detecting much slower targets and 2.) By producing SAR images of moving targets.This will lead to significant operational enhancements: The detection of slower moving targets substantially facilitate continuous tracking during a target's \"go-stop-go\" maneuver. Additionally, the imaging of moving targets will provide a tightly coupledtracking and target ID capability.Phase I clearly demonstrates the capability of this system to detect very slow moving targets (1 meter/sec), while canceling nonmoving targets and ground clutter. During Phase II, ISI will develop a SAMI sensor model to extend the domain of measurableDoppler and quantify the value-added using ISI's MOP/E (Measure of Performance/Effectiveness) tool. The improved tracking performance will lead directly to a target motion compensation procedure capable of focusing a SAR imager on a moving target. Thisallows for the extraction of more precise features from moving targets and there, an enhanced target ID capability.Phase III will extend these capabilities to space-based and bistatic scenarios.\"",

Our Phase 1 prototype software exploits mobile agentsinteracting using a contract net paradigm to maintain dynamic knowledge of network connectivity, to select near optimal routes, to automatically generate alternate routes when a previously good link fails, and to provide bandwidth reservation.  Thesimulated system works well even when the simulated nodes are moving so as to cause continual change in network connectivity.  We  have also developed a high level agent-based simulation, which runs on any number of fully decentralized computers connectedby a local area network.  This was made possible during the short time period of a Phase 1 SBIR because of IAI's work over the last seven years into the development of an infrastructure for software agent systems.  This infrastructure is called Cybele andis described in more detail in the body of this proposal.   A major benefit of using agents to implement the simulation is that the network specific agents such as the explorer, worm, and node agents can be almost directly ported to embedded radio hardwareto implement the actual system.\"",

We showed that 25mbps at 5miles is achievable in the near future. We have conductedextensive comparison of comparison of different antennaconfigurations, including diamond dipole antenna, Broadspecantenna, corner reflectors, and dish reflectors. We alsodeveloped several radio control programs to demonstrate theintegration of UWB's ranging and communication capability. Forexample, users can transfer files or send real-time messageswirelessly while tracking the distance between two radios.Another major effort we did for Phase I was to optimizecommunication performance of current UWB hardware. Weexperimentally evaluate several different communication schemes,and system parameters. We were able to obtain up to 1.25 mbpsover more than 200 feet with current UWB radios. In many IWapplications, moving (air or ground) vehicles are used to collectthe sensor data, so it is important to make sure radios canacquire signals and remain locked at higher speed. Therefore, wehave evaluated effects of vehicle motion on UWB communication.The results showed that UWB radios can work at more than 35 milesper hours. Higher speed tests will be conducted in Phase II.BENEFITS: While IW sensors do not represent a very large commercial market, the basic technology has very large commercial potential.  The following table shows the Potential Markets for TM-UWBLANs",

We propose to investigate two types of integration models based on the extent and feasibility of the level of integration and use appropriate game theoretic approaches to analyze these models. The proposed models are: (i) Data-sharing DST integration model: In this model, DSTs will primarily share data that is required for each DST to take a decision before an event happens. Based on the shared data each DST acts independently (ii) Interacting DST integration model: In this model, DSTs not only share data but also advise each other to act in such a way to reduce the level of conflict. Tools based on repeated strategic games and cooperative bargaining games will be used.

Low cost components which can measure delays down to 3 picoseconds are now available, and these now make it practical to build TM-UWB radar and communication systems which have no carrier signal. The only signals transmitted are single pulses. Impulses in the time domain generate very wide bandwidth signals in the frequency domain, and the signals generated by our current hardware have bandwidths in the gigahertz range. Because of this wide bandwidth, TM-UWB radar and radio is virtually impossible to detect and difficult to jam. TM-UWB radio requires no frequency allocation since energy is effectively transmitted on a wide band of frequencies simultaneously. Multiple non-interfering channels can be implemented in a single radio, hence very high data rates can be achieved, and the conventional problems with multipath do not affect TM-UWB. Because all that is transmitted is binary pulses, implementation of electronically steerable phased array systems is easy and effective. True time delay, the goal of past phased array development, becomes easy to achieve with TM-UWB radio and radar.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Our approach to aircraft wiring inspection is to inject a special type of low level probe signal into the cable to be tested.  The system response to this special input can be used to give the complete transfer function of the cable.  Incipient failures in the cable will be detectable as subtle changes in that transfer function, or cross-correlation between probe input signal and response, including discontinuities which cause signal reflections and hence standing waves.  Even very low probe signals can be used, and the test can be done on-line while the circuit is doing its normal function.  The required electronics can be fabricated into a low-cost single chip which would be built into the system or even built into the connector.  In this mode, the probe signal and test would be executing continuously.  Alternatively, the approach can be used offline.  Since very low level probe signals can be used, in many cases these signals can be induced into the cable and measured without disconnecting the cable.  We have been able to detect chafing, fouling, carbonization of insulation shorts and open faults.  Prototype hardware will be validated against a array of well-characterized wiring samples and systems prepared by our partner Raytheon and those available at the Sandia National Laboratory Aircraft Wiring Test bed.",

However, the problem of signal loss in optics continues to be a major difficulty - this is especially true in the Metro/Access marketplace.

Development and integration of these devices into a small, low-power optical module will be the outcome of this work.  The IFOSinnovation is the realization of lossless splitters seamlessly incorporating amplifiers with a modest fain.  In this regime, the pump power requirement as well as the signal-to-noise-ratio degradation are very low.  The IFOS design involves optimum balancebetween gain and nose figure and their dependencies on the waveguide parameters.  In Phase I IFOS designed, successfully fabricated, and characterized unique proof-of-principle optical amplifiers - including demonstration of sol-gel based Er+ dopeddevices.  Phase II will focus on the fabrication of commercially-viable packaged lossless splitters.  Concentrator will be on low-cost manufacturability, test and evaluation of performance characteristics, reliability, and preparation of the technology forcommercialization through strategic partners.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many cases of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) likely are caused by interruption of cochlear blood flow (CBF). Disruption of the internal auditory artery during surgical procedures to remove acoustic neuromas (ANs) probab'y account for many cases of postoperative deafness. Also, many cases of clinical SNHL, such as sudden SNHL, are thought to involve reduction of CBF. Previous experiments have demonstrated the utility of measuring cochlear blood flow using laser-Doppler flowmetry techniques. This proposal involves the refinement and clinical human testing of a novel otic probe and instrumentation capable of measuring CBF and electrocochleographic potentials. The probe will also have treatment capability in the form of irrigation and suction to present medications to the round window and inner ear. Phase I results demonstrated the feasibility of these functions in animal experiments using a prototype probe. In Phase II, a refined probe will be used to test safety and efficacy during human surgery. Ultimately, it is anticipated that this instrumentation will be used (1) intraoperatively to assist surgeons in preserving hearing during AN removal; (2) in research applications to elucidate the role of CBF in SNHL; (3) in the clinic for diagnosis and treatment of SNHL caused by vascular insufficiency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"The U.S. Army plans to deploy a new generation of forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensors with more than a million pixels per image, generated at the television frame rate.  With this unprecedented image detail, it will be necessary to process those imagesin real time using a super-resolution approach if they are to enable the timely identification of targets of interest.  Building on successful Phase I results, Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) proposes, in Phase II, to design, and generate completemanufacturing specifications for, an application-specific integrated circuit that incorporates image resolution enhancement algorithms developed specifically for military applications.  When fabricated and inserted into a FLIR video sensor, this chip willbe able to perform frame-by-frame image restoration in real time (at 30 or 60 Hz), greatly enhancing system performance.  IOS will work closely with Raytheon and other commercialization partners and secure commitments to insure the rapid deployment of thistechnology after successful completion of this Phase II research.  Hardware (chip-scale) implementation of the algorithms developed in Phase II will achieve greater resolution enhancement at the needed frame rates, at lower cost, size, and weight than anyalternative approach-making this technology a clearly preferable choice for many military and commercial applications.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Reducing mass is increasingly important to NASA spacecraft. MicroTechnology (MicroTech) fiber optic pressure transducers provide mass and power savings of up to 0.25 kg and 0.35 W per unit. Furthermore, the shift toward smarter spacecraft requires a larger number of pressure transducers. Development of a low mass, MicroTech fiber optic pressure transducer would greatly facilitate implementation of smart systems. Intelligent Optical Systems, Inc. (IOS) proposes to develop MicroTech fiber optic pressure transducers -- an enabling technology for all chemical and electrical Micro/Nano Spacecraft propulsion systems. IOS has pioneered innovative fiber optic solutions to diverse technological problems. We have made particular progress in Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) systems, which show real promise for use as MicroTech non-invasive, fiber optic pressure transducers. The IOS FBG system is based on a distributed array of in-line FBGs that convert pressure-induced strain into shifts in wavelength. Affixed to the external wall of a fuel supply tube, FBGs monitor changes in the pressure inside the tube by detecting the minute changes they induce in tube circumference. In Phase III of the proposed project, IOS will market a distributed fiber optic pressure monitoring system capable of determining the internal pressure and health of pipelines and structural components.",

Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS), based on the successful results of Phase I, proposes to develop a compact and multi-analyte sensing platform for use across all NASA enterprises. Specifically, IOS will develop a prototype MOFS (multiplexed optical fiber sensor) unit for measuring, in real time, the leakage of highly combustible cryogenic fluids (hydrogen and oxygen) in spaceport and spacecraft in low ppms over multiple locations. The use of optical fiber in the MOFS unit will eliminate the danger of any arc or spark. During Phase I, IOS successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed device by constructing an eight-channel experimental setup that was able to detect 0.02% oxygen and 0.1% hydrogen with no interference from 100% nitrogen, argon, helium, and carbon dioxide. IOS has committed $150,000 co-funding for Phase II, and has attracted $250,000 in additional follow-on funding. IOS will deliver the MOFS prototype to NASA, complete with software, manuals, and schematics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         An airborne fire is one of the most dreaded emergencies, as all pilots will acknowledge. Isolated at high altitudes, a fire-induced loss of systems can disable the aircraft beyond control. The space shuttles and the International Space Station face an even worse predicament. While an aircraft can land on a short notice, spacecraft are totally vulnerable. Existing fire sensors detect smoke or flame, indicating that the fire is in a relatively advanced stage, but these systems produce false alarms 199 times out of 200. Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) proposes to develop a fire onset detection system (FODS) that will: (a) detect fire at a very early stage, without false alarm, by performing trend analysis on key chemical markers and temperature, and (b) provide a continuous status update for intelligent decision making by the crew. In Phase I, IOS established the feasibility of FODS by detecting 50 ppm of carbon monoxide. In Phase II, the project team will develop and test a compact FODS prototype. This prototype system will have the capability to react to several fire markers simultaneously with a high level of reliability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         To improve hyperthermia and thermotherapy treatments by providing a realistic, cost effective and efficient technique for temperature profiling in treated tissues, Intelligent Optical Systems proposes to develop an optical fiber temperature (OFT) probe providing 10 points of high resolution temperature data in a single fiber. The OFT probe is an efficient alternative to thick bundles of arrayed single point temperature probes and expensive MRI thermometry to provide distributed temperature monitoring in tissue. In addition to BPH treatments, all intracavital treatments will benefit from the OFTs in-situ temperature profiling. Due to its non-conducting nature, the optical fiber probe is especially suited to radio frequency and microwave hyperthermia applications. In Phase I, the OFT probe demonstrated temperature measurement every 0.5 cm along the optical fiber with an accuracy of 0.2 degrees C, while reading all 7 points simultaneously in less than 5 seconds. These features of our OFT probe have already received keen interest from potential commercial partners. lOS proposes to develop a complete, clinically validated sensor probe with optoelectronic instrumentation as the Phase II end product.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This Phase II grant application requests funds for developing a portable monitoring system suitable for the general screening of bacterial fouling in water lines used in dental practice or in hemodialysis facilities. In Phase I, Intelligent Optical Systems (lOS) demonstrated the detection of bacteria biofilm on polycarbonate tubes (coupons) using flexible sub-mm optical fiber probe (Bioprobe). This system allows on-line detection, and eliminates the slow, laborious, and complicated microbial counting and microscopic methods currently used to monitor biofilm. Bioprobe is suitable for the real-time detection of sessile and suspended bacteria in dental unit water and other medical fluid delivery systems. In Phase II, lOS will detect 500 cfu/ml or better of planktonic and sessile bacteria by optimizing Bioprobe's sensitivity and reproducibility. Using a variety of bacterial cultures, the probe will be tested rigorously in the laboratory to establish its versatility. Neural network-based signal processing techniques will be used to remove cross-sensitivity to contaminants such as proteins and polysaccharides. At the end of Phase II, the Bioprobe will be alpha-tested in medical and dental clinics in preparation for its commercial launch.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The first commercial application of the on-line Bioprobe will be in the detection of biofilms in dental unit water lines (DUWLs). The Biprobe will also be used to detect biofilm buildup in food processing and hemodialysis systems. Eventually, we visualize the use of the Bioprobe in industrial systems in which biofilm acculation poses problems, including heat exchangers and desalination operations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Women's need for basic information about breast cancer, and the constraints on the time that health care providers have to educate their patients about the disease, are issues addressed in this proposal. In Phase I, IDI produced and field tested three voice-activated programs that allow women with and without breast cancer to engage in \"face-to- face\" virtual dialogues with an oncologist, a nurse practitioner, and a breast cancer survivor. The research findings showed that significant learning gain concerning breast self-exam, risk factors, risk reduction, early detection, diagnostic procedures, and treatment occurred with this method, Also, subjects reported increased feelings of confidence regarding their ability to communicate with health professionals and distinct feelings of emotional support from their virtual dialogues. In Phase II, IDI will enhance and expand the Patient Education on Breast Cancer Series and specifically evaluate the capability of the virtual dialogue method to enhance communication between patients and health care providers. Five additional programs will be developed to include additional breast cancer experts and survivor perspectives. The programs will be field tested at the Lombardi Cancer Center of Georgetown University and on three campuses of George Mason University by female subjects of diverse ages, ethnicity, and socioeconomic backgrounds. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: This unique product will be made available to breast health clinics, women's health centers, hospitals, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), private practices, and community clinics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         As a key component within Remote Agent, Livingstone has the most maturity and potential for commercialization. ICS is proposing to integrate Livingstone into an existing end-to-end architecture for real-time command and control. This flight proven architecture has been demonstrated recently with the NASA FUSE program. Adding the Livingstone component would fill a void in the SCL architecture and would significantly augment the capability of the spacecraft or rover for onboard autonomy. A significant deviation from the expected behavior of the model would be flagged to the inference engine. This would add an enhanced flexibility and versatility of the system in allowing the user or operator to use dynamic scripts and rules in order to complement a model and support progressive autonomy as necessary.ICS believes that the two technologies are highly complementary and would greatly benefit autonomous operations. The key to success is in the tight integration of those technologies into a flight proven environment and supported by an integrated ground development system. This includes the insertion of Livingstone in the flight architecture but also addresses the modifications of the ground development tools to merge the model-based and rule-based languages.",

Under the Phase I effort, InterScience Inc. has successfully demonstrated the application of its patented 360-degree/forward view imaging technology to small diameter digit endoscopes, with specific application to sinus surgery. In Phase II, we will significantly advance the development of this technology to the point of assembling fully integrated prototype 360 degree/forward view endoscopic systems and conducting initial clinical evaluation of the devices. The proposed Phase II effort will comprise optical design, development and assembly of a custom rigid endoscope system with an integrated 360 degree and forward view and real time image processing. Initial efforts include laboratory optical testing and cadaver testing for system optimization, and finally clinical evaluation in sinus surgery and airway evaluation applications. A successful Phase II effort will provide the necessary foundation to transfer the technology to additional endoscopic applications and to develop appropriate licensing arrangements with existing medical endoscope manufacturers.  At this time, we have received an expression of interest from Karl Storz GmbH & Co., a worldwide leader in endoscope production, in the development and commercialization of this technology.

BCMS may be used as a protein-based complement to genotyping approaches for SNP analysis, or even used on its own in phenotyping or clinical studies. The overall goal of this project is to further evaluate and validate the use of BCMS in important biological applications. Several selected proteins will be used as test systems and analyzed via BCMS. When perfected, BCMS will become a true chip-based proteomics tool with integrated sample preparation components, capable of rapid in-vitro analysis. As such, it stands to be employed in a variety of applications, such as identifications of molecular markers, identification and characterization of protein interactions, examination of molecular basis and profiles of a variety of ailments and delineation of protein structure/function in general. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Biosensor Chip Mass Spectrometry represents what we believe to be the first \"lab-on-a-chip\" concerted, multiplexed approach capable of protein fractionation, processing and structural analysis of proteins present in biological fluids at low levels.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Leak detection and location within manned spacecraft has been an elusive goal as was demonstrated on MIR. Manual leak detection, using ultrasonic technology, was successfully demonstrated at Johnson Space Center by a project team within ES using techniques for leak detection in pressurized aircraft. Manual surveys are intrusive to space craft activities and crews. An automated process of leak detection and location is needed. IVC proposes to do this with (a) existing space qualified hardware, (b) an addition of wideband ultrasonic transducers, and (c) new smart software algorithms that process emitted leak energy in a manner that results in detection and location of the leak. The uniqueness of the proposed approach is the use of large numbers of self-powered, miniaturized, stick on ultrasonic sensory nodes that are all synchronized within a radio frequency network and are self calibrating. The network provides the data paths and synchronization. Ultrasonic transducers can act as transmitters as well as receivers. Thus the sensor network calibrates itself thus increasing detection and location accuracy. Numbers of MicroWIS units (organized into such networks) have already been flown on Shuttle and station and have operated in a completely non-intrusive manner in regard to radio frequency, physical encumbrance, and astronaut time.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65144     Compact, rugged, lightweight, low-power and low-cost CO2 sensors are needed to accurately measure atmospheric CO2 concentrations on high-altitude-capable platforms like balloons.  These sensors must measure ambient CO2 concentrations with an accuracy better than 1 ppm, at ambient pressures as low as 0.1 atm, and at temperatures that may fall to 60C.  This project will develop a new class of Micro Electrical Mechanical System (MEMS)-based sensors-on-a-chip for CO2 concentration measurement.  These sensors will be compact, rugged, use low power, and low cost (< $20 each), and will combine all of the pieces for non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy into one component.  As optical sensors they are self-calibrating and not limited by ambient temperature or pressure.  In Phase I, detection of CO2 with the MEMS component was demonstrated at a precision of +0.15% over a very wide range of operating temperatures and pressures, using a lightweight, compact, multiple reflection optical cell that allowed rapid gas transfer.  Because the ultimate resolution was limited by noise in prototype electronic circuits, Phase II will improve the electronics to increase precision by a factor of five.  In addition, known temperature-sensitive materials will be used to further redesign the sensor chip to increase precision by another factor of ten, giving a +0.1 ppm accuracy instrument.  The prototype instrument will be field-tested and compared to existing instruments to demonstrate this precision.               Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Accurate, low-cost gas sensors should have applications for environmental controls (automobiles, indoor air quality, emissions control), industrial process control (fermentation, end-point detection), and safety (carbon monoxide detectors, natural gas leaks).  Existing technology does not meet all requirements at sufficiently low cost, accuracy, or lifetime.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65787      Optical communication provides significant advantages in bandwidth and security and has been implemented in long haul telecom networks around the world.  Technical solutions that prove cost effective in the long haul arena are proving prohibitive to the implementation of optical communication for shorter distance applications.  Devices must be developed that will permit the advantages of optical communication to be realized over shorter distances, eventually leading to the integration of optical communication within individual computer chips for ultra high speed computing.  This project will use self-assembled, silicon-quantum-dot nanocomposites and related deposition processes to produce high precision micro-optical circuits that are tuned, through local exposure to deep ultra violet radiation, for response after fabrication.  The Phase I effort screened materials and produced both ring resonator devices and Mach Zender interferometers with the self-assembled nanocomposites.  The response of the ring resonator devices was trimmed over a broad range.  Also, the ability of the interferometer to optimize transmission was altered with non-contact photoexposure.  Phase II will continue the nanocomposite engineering for microphotonic applications, develop designs and modeling tools to capitalize on the nanocomposite properties, and develop a precision local exposure tool to precision-trim the photonic circuits.  The results obtained from these three parallel efforts will be combined to construct and test precision-ring-resonator-based, all-optical, add-drop multiplexers for use in optical communication.          Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Devices based on the engineered naocomposite materials and trim process should be 99% smaller than currently available devices, while offering two to three orders of magnitude improvement in performance and two orders of magnitude cost reduction.  In addition to the photonic device market, the technology also should enable the next dramatic implementation of optical communication to individual businesses and homes.",

Flexible a-Si modules: 1) have shown minimum degradation due to radiation; 2) can have low fabrication costs; 3) havedemonstrated very high power to weight ratios; 4) have high tolerance to vibration and shock; 5) can be monolithically integrated to give very flexible design options.  Iowa Thin Film Technologies (ITFT) presently manufactures ultra lightweight amorphoussilicon solar cells using a polyimide web substrate for the terrestrial market.  Typical efficiency for the terrestrial product is approximately 5%.  Finished solar cells of this type are presently capable of a specific power of 750 W/Kg.  With a fullfocus on developing maximum efficiency for space use, laboratory results indicate that efficiency could approach 10%.    Under this effort, ITFT proposes a systematic program to transition our existing production-based terrestrial flexible monolithicintegrated a-Si to a low cost space-rated PV.  Since ITFT has already developed the core manufacturing processes of depositing on a flexible polymeric substrate and monolithic integration, we are in the unique position of being able to concentrate solelyon the issues associated with converting a low-cost terrestrial PV into a space PV.

The identity of the assembly pheromone of the tick will be confirmed and used to aggregate ticks that are attracted by host or tick related compounds formulated with an acaricide into a patented, EPA-registered bait matrix. Very low rates of insecticide will be required to achieve control, as the ticks will aggregate at the bait. Minimal toxicity enables bait application to areas of high human activity and sensitive ecosystems.

The successful commercialization of this product will improve public health by enabling caregivers to easily collect more information about a patient's condition. They will accomplish this by directly conducting blood tests on-site, during the patient's visit.lQuum proposes to continue the development of the lab-in-a-tube platform by designing and building prototypes of the three major components of the system: the desktop analyzer; the integrated sample collection and processing container, and the multiple-use, disposable reagent cartridge. The company will concurrently develop platelet function and coagulation assays as the first applications for the lab-in-a-tube system. The flexible detection and processing technology of the product enable the platform to conduct numerous types of tests, including blood typing, cell counting, and immunoassay. These assays will be developed separately and will showcase the full multifunction capability of the lab-in-a-tube system.",

The instructional program is targeted to older parents who have adult children with developmental disabilities living with them. Other users include local Arcs (formerly The Association for Retarded Citizens) and county case management MR/DD (Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities) service delivery systems. Instruction will use competency-based strategies that integrate the use of stages of change, social cognitive theory, video instruction, and suggested family activities. The basis for the proposed approach derives from Social Cognitive Theory and the Stages of Motivational Readiness for Change Model. The completed program will consist of a series of five training modules: 1) Building My Lifebook, 2) The Future Planning Process, 3) Gathering information, 4) Putting your plans into action, and 5) Keeping information current. The research component of this project is designed to demonstrate that the Life History Album kit and videos will be used by parents of developmentally disabled adults to begin to produce a Life History Album (LHA) and that after using these materials parents will have advanced along the stages of change towards undertaking and establishing permanency plans for their adult children. We intend to use a two-group (Control/Intervention) pre-posttest design with measurements at multiple (3) time points. We will be testing the effectiveness of the LHA in motivating parents to undertake permanency planning against one of the most common handbooks available on this subject, the Family Handbook on Future Planning produced by the Arc.",

It willalso alleviate the need for ASIC processors and controllers in many applications, as RISC versions of high-end microprocessors can also be emulated.  Using currently available FPGAs, it will even be possible to reconfigure on-the-fly, such that softwarefor different platforms may be run on the same system, with the transitions being transparent to the user.  Projecting a step further, developers may be able to customize the behavior of the processor to optimize for a specific complex task, or mix andmatch the best of multiple processors, all within software.  ISC is in a unique position to develop such a system.  Using a novel 3D stacking method, we can turn a prototype system of COTS components into a monolithic device, bypassing the IC design andwafer manufacturing steps.  This approach has the added benefit that we can readily upgrade the system as the component COTS technologies are advanced.  The complexity and the performance improvement provided by stacking will allow the stacked modules tohave performance similar to monolithic ASICs.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Even with multi-layer insulation blankets, cryogenic thermal switches, thermal distribution systems (such as cryogenic heat pipes), and advanced thermal/structural isolation systems, the mission capability of a fully-passive, stored cryogen system is compromised by the lack of an active cooler to recharge the system. This shortcoming is particularly acute at very low temperatures (<15 K) because there are no proven, long-life space cryocooler technologies for that operational temperature range. The primary technological barrier to extending proven Stirling and pulse tube technologies down to liquid helium temperatures is the absence of a regenerator design that will function at the high frequencies (> 30 Hz) required to enable small, compact designs typical of existing flexure-bearing, space-qualified cryocoolers. Irvine Sensors Corporation proposes to develop an advanced regenerator, based upon the use of novel rare earth metal matrix designs to enable very-low-temperature Stirling and pulse tube cryocoolers for both ground and space applications. The matrix will offer the combined benefits of low porosity and an extremely high surface-area-to-volume ratio, both of which are essential for very low temperature operation. Our goal is to achieve a 50 percent improvement in efficiency for high-frequency regenerators operating around a cold head temperature of 5 K.",

Optimization of bulk production of PNC pheromone and of the mating disruption and A&K; devices will be done during Phase II, as well as preparation for the commercialization of these products. In Phase III we will finalize the optimization of mass production of pheromone and of the controlled release devices and proceed with execution of the commercialization plan. The objectives of this Phase II are to: 1). Reliably synthesize E9, Z11-16:Al in large scale, 2). Optimize our mating disruption formulation and field technique using only sex-pheromone, 3). Optimize formulations and field techniques for the two strategies of attract and kill, 4) Map the distribution of pheromone and the presence of moths and male capture in traps. 5). Begin the optimization process of industrial production of PNC pheromone and of the different formulations",

The goal of IPM is to minimize reliance on pesticides by emphasizing the moment-to-moment knowledge of the field situation to dynamically make decisions and deliver timely, targeted actions. Current IPM programs use data collection technologies from early 1900s, thus lacking speed and integration necessary to generate reports required by decision-makers who need to act quickly. With the Phase II development of a robust centralized Internet hub housing expert systems for automated data analysis, reporting (with GIS) and quick distribution of information, the benefits to agriculture will be unsurpassed.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Because chondrocytes in culture are phenotypically unstable, techniques to grow tissue-engineered cartilage for the repair of injured or arthritic joints have met with limited success. Using human donor chondroctyes, we have developed an innovative method for producing what we call neocartilage, a viable, biomechanically stable tissue that we plan to commercialize for the repair of chondral defects in knee joints. Unlike native adult cartilage, which has no capacity for continued growth or repair, the chondrocytes in our neocartilage continue to produce cartilage molecules, resulting in a cartilage tissue that has the potential to repair chondral defects resulting from trauma. In this proposal , we will optimize tissue culture techniques needed for neocartilage production. As a preface to the transplantation studies, we will optimize methods for fixation of neocartilage allografts to the host tissue. In addition, we will evaluate the structural, biochemical, and biomechanical properties of the neocartilage allografts both pre- and post- transplanation in a weight-bearing sheep model. This proposal is unique because it combines biomechanical and biochemical methods of evaluating integrative repair of cartilage defects. We anticipate that upon completion of this proposal, the necessary data will be available to design a pre-clinical study for presentation to the FDA. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Our IstoCyte neocartilage has the potential to repair damaged chondral lesions in injured joints perhaps preventing these lesions from destroying bone and cartilage. Furthermore, the neocartilage allograft can offer arthritis patients an alternative to current therapies, perhaps preventing osteoarthritis or delaying total joint replacement.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Thin-film photovoltaic cells offer the promise of high specific power arrays for space applications. Two thin-film photovoltaics technologies are presently vying for use in space applications; copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (CIGS), and amorphous silicon. This proposal focuses on efficiency improvements to the CIS-alloy technologies by the continued development of a third possibility, copper-indium-aluminum-diselenide (CIAS). This wide-bandgap thin-film technology will be deposited by co-evaporation at low substrate temperatures on sub-bandgap light transparent back contacts and lightweight, flexible and sub-bandgap light transparent polyimide substrates. To achieve the optimum bandgap of about 1.45 eV for the space solar spectrum, less than half the amount of aluminum (Al) is needed in CIAS, then gallium (Ga) in CIGS. Thus, using Al may avoid a concentration limit (bandgap limit) similar to the amount of Ga in CIGS for the degradation of material electrical quality due to Ga-Ga defect complexes. Other advantages of the proposed technology include: higher-efficiency modules due to lower resistive and distributed diode losses; higher-efficiency modules at higher operating temperatures due to more favorable temperature coefficients of cell parameters and complete IR transmission; potential for backside array visible light collection, and high end-of-life-efficiency modules due to inherent charged particle radiation resistance of CIS based alloys.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Absence of Oxalobacter formigenes (Oxf) from the GI-tract is a risk factor for development of hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate kidney stones. Recent data now indicate that patients with recurrent urolithiasis have a lower prevalence rate of Oxf in their stools than non-stone forming individuals. In addition, urinary oxalate levels are higher in non-colonized individuals as compared to colonized individuals. This indicates a clinical need for a test that can identify non-colonized individuals. Phase I of this grant resulted in the development of a reliable and rapid PCR ELISA-based microtiter plate assay for the detection of Oxf in human fecal samples. Pre-clinical performance data for the test (Le. its analytical sensitivity, analytical specificity, precision and reproducibility) were obtained as per the NCCLS guidelines. In Phase II of this project, we propose to complete the development of a production prototype of the XEntrix(TM) O. formigenes Monitor Kit. Analytical and clinical performance of the prototypic test kit will be determined in a multicentre clinical trial. The clinical studies have been designed not only to validate the test kit but also to strengthen the utility of Oxf determination as a diagnostic tool for the assessment of risk for calcium oxalate urolithiasis. By end of the proposed Phase II studies, we will have sufficient analytical and clinical performance data on this diagnostic kit to seek a pre-market approval under section 510K of the Food Drugs and Cosmetic Act, from the Center for Devices and Radiological Health.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): Plasmodium falciparum is the parasitic protozoan responsible for fatal malaria in humans. It causes about 300 million clinical case of malaria and 2-3 million deaths annually. There is no vaccine against malaria, so selection of drug resistant malaria parasites has been a major factor in increased malaria morbidity and mortality in the last two decades. The few drugs that have been developed are too expensive for routine use in malaria treatment in most developing countries where the main burden of disease is felt. Inhibitors of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) like pyrimethamine have been excellent antimalarials, but point mutations in the target gene compromised its effectiveness. The PS series of drugs are biguanides that are metabolized to triazines that also inhibit the P. falciparum DHFR. In Phase I, we have shown that these triazines do not show cross-resistance to any of the previously tested inhibitors of the P. falciparum DHFR, pyrimethamine, cycloguanil or chlorcycloguanil. In addition, we have recently discovered that these compounds are effective inhibitors of the DHFR enzyme from P. vivax, the most prevalent human malaria parasite. A clinical candidate has been selected based on 90 day oral studies in mice. This proposal is to support the preclinical safety assessment to bring this candidate to the clinic, to continue the yeast genetics program providing field monitoring for the development of resistance, and to extend the mechanism of action studies.",

The high temperature capability of diamond and its non-dipole crystal structure will allow rapid charge/discharge cycles without damage. During Phase I, a single layer test capacitor 5 cm. in diameter will provide 35 nano-farads of capacitance and 0.16 Joules of energy with an energy density of 0.04 J/g. Phase II will develop a multi-layer capacitor in a stacked configuration to increase the energy density, capacitance, and total energy stored in the capacitor. The Phase II device is expected to have energy density greater than 0.5 J/g, provide 1 micro-farad capacitance, and store 4.5 Joules of energy and reduce PPT system mass by 30%.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop software and hardware products that assist people with low vision to efficiently read and process information from many sources. These products will combine optical character recognition (OCR), speech synthesis and recognition technologies, together with customizable displays based on the latest vision research to accommodate a variety of visual impairments. These products will incorporate a 'Pick and Click' user interface, developed in Phase I, which does not require viewing the screen, yet presents visual displays useful to a low vision person, and is intuitive to fully sighted teachers experienced with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Included in the products will be functions particular to the low vision market, such as reading text optimally, enlarging pictures, and using a video camera for magnification while handwriting and viewing 3D objects. In addition, 'Pick and Click' interfaces to the most common computer applications programs, such as word processing, e-mail, Internet browser, spreadsheet, and financial accounting will be included. Low vision users will benefit from a low cost interface that provides a clean and less cluttered presentation of information on the screen. JBliss Imaging's proffered new technology has potential to improve access to and capability of manipulating information for the low vision population.. The technology also has potential to serve individuals with other disabilities, such as dyslexia and other forms of challenges to learning and reading abilities. Commercial applications are in schools, libraries, businesses, and homes.",

Reliable nondestructive detection of hydrogen embrittlement effects in high-strength steelaircraft components has been identified as critical for safety and sustainment of U.S. Air Force aircraft.  In Phase I, using both high-resolution MWM-Array imaging and permanently mounted MWM-Arrays, JENTEK demonstrated (1) sensitivity to hydrogenembrittlement, (2) small crack detection (less than 0.01-in.) in 4340 steel, (3) precrack fatigue detection and monitoring in a high-strength steel (suitable for failure likelihood prediction), (4) stress measurement, and (5) characterization of shotpeened steel through cadmium plating.  These demonstrated capabilities establish the feasibility to detect and characterize microstructure variations associated with hydrogren embrittlement, estimate applied and residual stresses, and detect early stagecracking for critical landing gear components.  The proposed capability enhancements for the Phase II research will provide an effective portable tool for laboratory, production, and field applications.  In Phase II, JENTEK will develop robust, fieldableprocedures for detection of hydrogen embrittlement in high-strength steels.\"",

This is particularly costly in the field where decisions regarding repair and reuse must be made quickly by available personnel.  This project will develop high resolution, eddy current sensor arrays to provide reliable materials information in real-time at the plant site, including     in situ inspection without component removal and increased inspection throughput at reduced total inspection costs.  Phase I demonstrated: (i) characterization of aging of McrAlY coatings, (ii) detection of cracks and the determination of crack depth in coated and uncoated components, (iii) imaging damage on service exposed components, (iv) a four- or five-unknown algorithm to provide reliable quantitative characterization of different complex coatings systems, both aged unaged, and (v) substantial commercial demand among OEMs, utilities, rework/repair facilities, and service providers.  Phase II will develop a methodology to predict the likelihood of failure before the next inspection from specific aging mechanisms, including creep, fatigue and corrosion. In particular, Phase II will (1) demonstrate a capability to predict failure likelihood from at least one specific aging mechanism, (2) demonstrate a capability to distinguish life-limiting cracks from inconsequential cracks, (3) develop a preliminary method for detection and characterization of corrosion and erosion-corrosion in syngas-fired HGP components, (4) enhance the capability of the demonstrated four-unknown algorithm, (5) demonstrate in situ crack detection and/or aging characterization capability without blade removal, and (6) develop decision support tools for materials, component, and fleet life management.

We developed system parametric analytical design models showing this technology can provide: waferheating and cooling rates>104 oK/sec; uniformity>0.1%, in a process independent of surface layers, patterns and wafer size; and system throughput exceeding 100wafers/hr (200mm diameter).  Initial experimental data and prior experience with atmosphericplasma applications served to validate the models.  This is the only known technology that can provide extremely Rapid Thermal Processing with a corresponding extremely low thermal budget and uniformity independent of patterning.  The Phase II objective isto build a Test Bed and demonstrate the advantages of this technology in fabricating advanced silicon and non-silicon devices.

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a digital video surveillance system prototype. Over the past few years, video surveillance systems have been moving from analog to digital. The success of a digital video surveillance system depends on three key enabling technologies: compression, search and retrieval and network transmission. Existing commercial systems generally use standard video compression techniques, which often result in higher memory and bandwidth requirements and jerky object motion. In current video search and retrieval, the existing systems offer only search-by-time and no search-by-content. In network transmission, today's systems use relatively simple techniques that tend to make remote monitoring slow and sluggish. The company is using a highly efficient compression algorithm that exploits the special characteristics of surveillance video and is based on a segmentation technique. This technique, when applied to video search and retrieval, leads to search-by-content, which is more efficient and effective in practical applications. Finally the proposed system will employ fast network transport protocols and scalability techniques to make remote monitoring faster, uninterrupted by network traffic surges, and to allow display on a range of user devices. This digital video surveillance system can be used to maintain the security of banks, airports, government buildings, corporate sites, homes, and small businesses. It can also be used to monitor the performance and operating conditions of machines and equipment",

A major impediment to rapid adoption of appliqu is the high cost associated with installation labor. In Phase I major installation laborcost drivers were prioritized as edge sealing, forming appliqu around protruding head fasteners, large area applications and compound curvatures. Phase I R&D; focused on development of a edge sealing robot, with additional effort directed toward fastenerissues. The primary Phase I accomplishment was the demonstration of breadboard hardware and software allowing a robot using computer vision to autonomously identify and seal the seams of appliqu interfaces. In Phase II KCI will continue to work withaircraft primes as we modify, extend and adapt the capabilities of the Phase I robot. Phase II will culminate with a demonstration on a near-commercial version of the robotic technology, based on R&D; initiated in Phase I. The robot demonstration willinclude edge seaming and forming of appliqu onto rivet heads of commercial and military aircraft. The Phase II robotic system will require only occasional supervision to address major portions of an aircraft's skin, including vertical and invertedsurfaces.\"",

Considerable Phase II effort will be devoted to developing methodsfor cost-effectively shaping the leading edges of grid structures. Several iterative rounds of fin design, fabrication and performance verification via static and dynamic wind tunnel testing are planned.

The new composite system was projected tohave approximately the same installed cost as the present steel hatch. Corrosion resistance of composites will reduce life cycle cost. KCI also demonstrated a new type of composite material having fire properties that Phase I testing showed to be, in someformulations, better than other conventional composite solutions. In Phase II KCI will continue to evaluate this new composite material, update and finalize hatch designs with the new and conventional composites, then fabricate and test full scale hatchsystems from the best material.

A seamless, XML-driven interface to a web server at the Minnesota Population Center will make it possible for teachers and students to specify, request, and import this microdata into Fathom Dynamic Statistics software. Enhancements to Fathom software will increase its already considerable ease and power for working with census microdata; curriculum materials in mathematics will provide teachers with effective ways to begin working with this highly motivating data--both to teach existing content and to teach data literacy. Phase I research suggested strong similarities between census microdata and school census microdata data that is gathered by K-12 schools about student demographics and performance, course offerings, and classroom practice. Accordingly, Phase II leverages this overlap to produce greatly needed interfaces for easily accessing school census microdata, survey tools for producing it, and extensions to Fathom for analyzing it. KCP Technologies' census microdata project exploits the merging web connectivity in American schools, thus symbiotically fitting a larger pattern of evolution of school technologies. The project offers a product that supports analysis of complex data through an easy-to-use interface which will contribute to data anlysis and learning from data analysis. U.S. education is very much in need of the kinds of software and curriculum resources to be produced under this project",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In Phase I Kestrel Corporation developed and demonstrated a retinal imaging system that combines multispectral imaging techniques with adaptive optics and image deconvolution to provide high resolution less than (<10 micrometers), in-vivo images. The enabling technologies such as the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, adaptive optics, and image deconvolution algorithm have been demonstrated by Kestrel on human and non-human test objects. Others in the US and Spain have developed adaptive optics system for laboratory use and have achieved about 4 micrometer resolution images of the retina. These laboratory devices have given researchers a powerful tool for studying the smallest structures of the retina. Unfortunately, none of these systems are suitable for clinical use because of their small field of view (FOV) of 1 degree, than large size (greater than 30 square feet), and their complexity. Our system increases the FOV from 1 degree to 20 degrees and packages the technologies so that they easily fit on a standard fundus imager. We have demonstrated several patented technologies, including a dithered laser to overcome   specular reflections and eliminate multiple Shack-Hartmann images for wavefront measurements. To  reduce cost of the system and to reduce the complexity, a deconvolution algorithm has allowed us to use a simpler (17 element) bimorph adaptive optics mirror. Our prototype Phase I system with its patented modifications has solved the technical issues that have limited the use of adaptive optics to research instruments.  The first aim of Phase II is to design and develop a commercial prototype.    The second aim of this project is to evaluate, through a comprehensive human subjects study, not the  research significance, but the clinical value of high resolution images of the retina and optic disc. The images will be evaluated by experienced ophthalmologists. The clinical functionality of the high resolution spectral fundus imager (HRSFI) will be evaluated by having the ophthalmologists compare images taken with a standard fundus camera and the HRSFI. A statistical evaluation of the double-blinded study will quantitate the value in diagnosing diseases such as pro-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emerging Internet-based technology has vast potential to extend cancer prevention communications and interventions widely through corporate wellness markets. While access to web-based technology is not yet universal, computer-based tools for worksite health promotion offer the potential for significantly increasing the accessibility of programs and breadth of option that employers can provide. Currently, 51 percent of worksites with 750+ employees use Internet, Intranet or kiosk-based delivery channels for lifestyle behaviors change programs. A 1999 national survey of worksites found that, in as few as 3 years, computer-based programs could become the most feasible and comprehensive channel for employee health promotion. Of all the dietary factors related to cancer prevention, research evidence is most consistent for an inverse association between cancer risk and fruit and vegetable consumption. We will produce a web-based multimedia worksite 5 A Day health promotion program with computer resources for worksite wellness professionals and educational interfaces and communication features for employees. The multimedia program is based on successful worksite 5 A Day interventions developed by researchers at the AMC Cancer Research Center (AMC) and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) in NCI-funded ROl projects. Partners for Health Systems, Inc. will collaborate with AMC, FHCRC, and the Produce for Better Health Foundation on multimedia development and evaluation. A pair-matched randomized controlled trial with 800 employees and 64 worksite wellness professionals in 32 companies will test the effectiveness of the web-based 5 A Day Program at increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables and its efficacy for Phase III commercialization. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Worksite health promotion programs are considering by employers to be one of the most effective strategies for managing health care costs, increasing employee moral, and improving employee health status. The interactive multimedia nutrition education program created in this project will represent the next generation in worksite health promotion technologies. It will have application in any and all worksite wellness settings as personal computers and Internet/Intranet systems expand in the workplace.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"Distributed learning is rapidly shifting many instructor-led classes to web-based training.   But making the e-learning experience as effective as an instructor requires an arsenal of learner support tools that barely exists today. One noteworthy void isvalidating e-learning through authentic assessment, which includes mimicking excellent instructor feedback.  In Phase I we demonstrated that the Intelligent Essay Assessor (IEA) can out-perform skilled graders, and developed a method to self-calibrate thesystem without human graded essays. From modeling instructors' comments on officers' memos, we identified requirements and explored automated methods for content commenting tools. Today's computerized writing tools focus on the nits of writing (style,grammar), whereas skilled instructors focus on content--semantics, knowledge, clarity, and appropriate supporting evidence.  While past work has shown that IEA using Latent Semantic Analysis is indistinguishable from instructors' overall grades, thefeedback it provides is still minimal.  In Phase II we will develop more detailed and informative content-based feedback that will guide the practice by revision that is essential to good writing. Feedback will be developed for structured memos and fortopically wide ranging papers.  An integrated assessment and commenting system will be fielded and evaluated in at least one Army instructional environment.\"",

The Army has collected extensive background information on USMA '98 cadets (BOLDS), who are nearing their final year of mandatory service.In Phase 1 we developed new leadership measures of higher order competencies--emotional maturity, strategic, tactical, and managerial tacit knowledge. The battery uses open-ended responses to:  tactical military scenarios (TLAC), extended Tacit Knowledgeof Military Knowledge case studies, and components of Kegan's cognitive-emotional development interviews. All measures can be assessed and categorized using Latent Semantic Analysis, a machine learning technology that understands text. In Phase 2 theCommand Performance battery will be related to predictors in the BOLDS background data and to performance in real world settings.In Phase 2 we propose collecting: (1) Command Performance data over the Internet for a subset of the USMA class of '98, (2) objective measures of leadership, such as NTC performance, and (3) subjective measures, such as Officer Evaluation Reports, 360feedback. Using structural equation modeling and other data mining techniques, we will find predictive background variables of leadership performance and relate them to current performance. When fully developed, Command Performance will be offered by Knowledge Analysis Technologies directly to the Army as an ADL enabled leadership assessment and prediction technology.  It will also be suitable for adaptation for use in other DoD branches,corporate leadership training, and educational applications such as business and public administration.  The latter commercial applications will be developed and marketed by joint ventures between Knowledge Analysis Technologies and one or more of thedistance education and corporate training organizations with whom we have now or will develop arrangements.

Using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Auto-autodidact (autodidact: a self-taught person) first learns the vocabulary and concepts of a topic by automatic training on textbooks. Then, as students study and write, and groups discuss and plan, it will continuously evaluate what they know and do not know, find relevant information anywhere in an electronic library, and connect participants with complementary needs and knowledge. Auto-autodidact capitalizes on the motivational power of peer interaction, the instant availability of enormous textual resources, and the possibility of sharing individual knowledge over time and space. Auto-autodidact will integrate LSA with a state-of-art environment for distributed knowledge-building discussion and newly available electronic libraries to provide continuous embedded assessment, tutorial dialogue, and meaning-based information insertion. It will be unique in its ability to construct a learning environment for a new domain, customizing it for the needs of either an individual learner or a collaborating team, in a matter of days or even minutes. As we move into a networked world, Knowledge Analysis Technologies' proffered technology has the potential to weave together people and ideas, generating knowledge and fostering collaboration. If the project realizes its potential and consistently delivers useful results to users, it could transform how we interact with data and with one another.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         There is an immediate and growing need for technology to remediate groundwater and soils contaminated with methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as well as with associated benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) compounds. Gasoline containing MTBE has leaked into groundwater, presenting both health risks and objectionable odor and taste in lakes, aquifers, and urban wells in 49 states. Due to the specific physical and chemical properties of MTBE, conventional technologies cannot remediate MTBE-contaminated groundwater satisfactorily. In the Phase I research project, KSE, Inc., established the technical feasibility of a novel technology to remediate MTBE-contaminated groundwater and soils. One major innovation provides a novel technology to completely destroy MTBE and BTEX in air from groundwater strippers or soil vapor extraction. Extremely low temperature catalytic oxidation has been achieved with a new class of catalysts designed specifically for these compounds. Operating temperatures of 30-80C were achieved. The new catalyst activity is orders of magnitude greater than that of the traditional platinum alumina catalyst. The low temperature operation allows use of advanced design materials to further lower pollution control costs to 5-15 percent of those of conventional methods. With the commercialization of this new class of catalysts, an inexpensive, compact, and effective technique will be available for cleaning up groundwater and soils contaminated by fuel oxygenates, avoiding the cost and size of traditional high temperature catalytic oxidizers, with their attendant heat exchangers and piping systems. This new class of catalysts will be commercialized in the Phase II research project. The project involves catalyst optimization and kinetic studies offering both mechanistic insight and design procedures. Large-scale prototype operation will be undertaken to demonstrate both the catalyst performance and such materials of construction as fiberglass-reinforced plastic, made possible by the low temperature catalyst operation. A competitive cost analysis of the technology relative to other alternatives will be performed for MTBE remediation. It is anticipated that a cost-effective technology will be developed for remediation of MTBE-contaminated groundwater that is capable of rapid deployment.",

This needed capability allows experimental verification of warm X-ray inducedthermomechanical response, SGEMP, and box IEMP models for achieving component and system certification to hostile environments.In a reflex triode, electrons reflex through a thin, high Z converter generating a relatively soft bremsstrahlung spectrum. Converter and cathode foils are vaporized during triode operation. Expansion of these vaporized materials impulsively loads thedebris shield causing a transient dynamic response. Deformation of the debris shield defines the maximum dose achievable.Stimulus and deformation of the debris shield can be reduced by minimizing the vaporized mass of converter and converter substrate and by selecting proper materials and configurations. Composite materials, particularly in a honeycomb configuration, canprovide very high moduli debris shields (low deformation) without sacrificing X-ray transmission.Phase I developed the capability to manufacture ultra-thin converters, designed an advanced composite debris shield, and developed an advanced reflex triode design. Phase II completes development of the optimized reflex triode and provides advanced reflextriode designs for Decade Quad, Double Eagle, Pithon and MBS stimulators.\"",

Early diagnosis of prostate, ovarian, breast and other cancers will allow the physician to intervene earlier in the cancer progression, with greatly improved outcomes.  Rapid monitoring of cancermarkers will also allow evaluation of a cancer patient's response to therapy and to check for recurrence or metastatic spread.  This revolutionary new device for the detection of cancer markers arises via the synergy of two established technologies, thesilicon microsampler that was pioneered at Kumetrix for painless blood sampling combined with exquisitely sensitive and selective aptamer technology.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lyme disease is a multi-systemic infection caused by the pathogen Borrelia burgdorjeri. The black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is the common vector for B. burgdorferi. This tick also transmits the agents of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis and babesiosis. The purpose of this project is to develop an anti-I. scapiilaris vaccine to block tick attachment and tick-mediated disease transmission. Rabbits or guinea pigs infested with I. scapularis acquire antibody-mediated resistance to tick bites, a phenomenon known as \"tick-immunity.'' Phase I experiments evaluated Salp13 and Salp25D, two recombinant proteins expressed from I. scapularis salivary gland cDNAs, as candidate vaccines. Guinea pigs immunized with a combination of the two recombinant proteins demonstrated host resistance to tick bites. Phase II specific aims are to: (a) produce prototype Salp 13 and Salp25D vaccines suitable for extensive testing in animal models; (b) investigate Salp 13 and Salp25D contributions to the tick bite-induced tick immunity; and (c) determine if immunization with an optimized Salp13/Salp25D vaccine blocks pathogen transmission from ticks. These experiments will lead to Phase III development of a new vaccine designed to protect against multiple tick-borne pathogens. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: A vaccine against Ixodes scapiilaris tick bites would potentially protect against several pathogens, including B. burgdorferi, Babesia microti, and the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis. The commercial market would overlap with the market for LYMErix, a Glaxo SmithKline human Lyme disease vaccine, and the currently approved canine Lyme disease vaccines.",

This purified binding protein has the potential to act as a     \r  tracer for human IgE without interference from other human plasma proteins like    \r  lgG, IgM or albumin that are present in large molar excess. The bacterial          \r  protein can capture human lgE when immobilized and can be biotinylated without     \r  loss of functional activity. These properties suggest that this protein can act    \r  as a protein A or protein G equivalent bacterial-binding protein for IgE. This     \r  bacterial protein has the potential to replace current second antibody reagents    \r  specific for the epsilon heavy chains that are currently used for allergy          \r  testing in clinical laboratories. There are many advantages of the bacterial       \r  tracer over the current antibody reagents that include ease of preparation,        \r  ability to readily modulate affinity and the economics of production.

This was successfully demonstrated during the Phase I project having removed a variety of appliqu samples using the diode laser stripping method and it wasalso demonstrated that the process is six times faster than the current method for decoating appliqus.  Our approach is to build upon this success by performing in-depth qualitative testing and undergoing a five-cycle coating/decoating test coupled withmaterial testing. This will prove the diode lasers process as safe and repeatable in the ability to remove appliqus. The project will conclude with a detailed design of a full-scale system for rapid removal from aircraft surfaces in a depotenvironment.BENEFITS: While laser stripping technology is not new, the efficient and practical use is. This is what diode laser stripping brings to industy, a cost effective, fast, easy to use method f",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"Simulation of the real world has long been recognized as an effective means for testing military equipment. However, effective testing requires that simulation be of high fidelity. It becomes paramount, therefore, to model accurately the environment inwhich simulation takes place. For human-in-the-loop testing, the need for fidelity places severe demands upon display technology; demands that push the limits of virtual imagery with respect to resolution, brightness, field of view, and contrast ratio.This is particularly true when a display must be HUD compatible; i.e., when imagery must be projected from infinity. The Air Force's Preflight Integration of Munitions and Electronic Systems (PRIMES) facility provides a simulated environment wherein testsare conducted within an RF anechoic chamber. This calls for displays that have little or no influence upon RF fields. During our Phase I program, we identified and demonstrated via proof-of-concept testing a combination of display technologies thatprovides infinity-based out-the-window imagery without involving either electronic or metallic surfaces within the chamber. Our proposed Phase II program will integrate these technologies so as to develop a panoramic display which will be delivered to theAir Force for test and evaluation within the PRIMES facility.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal requests SBIR Phase II support to complete and field test language intervention software designed to promote syntactic development in school-age children (5-12 years old).  Language delays are pervasive among school-age children. What's more, two thirds of children identified as having language-specific impairments previously nor have received any form of language intervention during their preschool years. Consequently, there is a clear need to develop language intervention strategies designed specifically to meet the needs of this population; that is, intervention designed to promote development of the more advanced syntactic constructions typically missing from the grammar of these children. In Phase I, a curriculum was developed for introducing the syntax of interrogative operators. Curriculum design was guided by contemporary linguistic research, which suggests ways in which treatment may be improved and more successful outcomes achieved. Software was developed to deliver parts of this curriculum, and was integrated with an artificial intelligence component capable of generating individualized lessons based on emerging competencies. Twenty-six kindergartners used the software successfully during field- testing. In Phase II these efforts will be expanded by developing an integrated series of language intervention modules and verifying that the modules are effective under typical classroom conditions. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Speech-language pathologists, teachers and parents recognize the importance of intervention when a child's language status is impaired, and such intervention is mandated by Federal Law. As such, we anticipate that our computer-based language intervention system, designed to facilitate language development in school-age children, will be a commercial success and will fulfill an unmet need for individual services.",

Visible light photon counters (VLPCs), fabricated several years ago, showed significant promise but suffered from significant variations in gain.  This project will utilize epitaxial process expertise to develop a new generation of VPLCs with improved properties, including much narrower gain dispersion and lower cost.  In Phase I, eighty 5-inch wafers were produced, 10 each of 8 different combinations of donor and acceptor doping.  Low defect density and excellent uniformity were demonstrated.  In Phase II, visible light photon counters will be fabricated from the Phase I wafers and tested.  Based on the results, the design will be modified and a second round of epitaxial wafers will be grown.  Devices fabricated from the second round will be provided to end-users.                       Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Applications for visible light photon counters in combination with plastic scintillator include electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry, shower max detectors, preshower detectors, photon vetos, large-scale neutrino detectors, muon hodoscopes, and high resolution tracking systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's abstract) Many clinical/medical conditions, i.e,           neurological emergencies and disorders, require rapid intervention. Stroke is        one example. In this context, availability of medical devices can enhance            medical care to the patient.                                                                                                                                              Blood cell counters, which are used to count blood components such as red and        white blood cells, are ubiquitous in medicine as a diagnostic aid for disease        identification or as a general tool for many medical therapies. The pre-eminent      device in use today is the Coulter counter, which is expensive, large, and           generally not portable, requiring at least a desktop, household current supply       and a small support laboratory. The goal of this research and development            project is to design a prototype miniature blood cell counter for home-care, or      point-of-care analysis in doctors' offices, clinics, and hospitals.                   The novel blood counter we propose to develop is based on new, emerging              micromachine technologies, and would be approximately the size of a small            cell-phone, requiring very low electrical power. Similar to an inkjet print          head, which is also a product of micromachined fluidics technology, the core         analytical components of the miniature blood counter would be inexpensively          mass-produced. The cost per unit would be low enough that the analytical             portion could here placed after each use.                                            PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed device has several likely economic advantages.  Firstly, it will reduce the  need for and cost of transport of blood samples to centralized laboratory.  Secondly,  expedient diagnosis will mean fewer clinical complications fewer office visits, shorter  hospital stays and possible a reduced need to transport patients.  It could result in an  overall savings of several million dollars annually.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Inflatable membrane concentrators for space solar power currently have two large weight penalties. The extra inflatant needed to make up for gas leaked through construction defects or meteoroid holes can dominate system weight for long missions. Also the inefficiency of the canopy over the reflector can be great, requiring doubling the reflectors size to compensate. We plan to make the inflatable membrane concentrators for space solar power viable by reducing these two largest weight penalties. We can greatly reduce the first penalty by lowering inflation pressure to a minimum by constructing the reflector from formed gores, requiring essentially zero strain to obtain the desired shape. We will learn in laboratory testing how to seam such formed gores to retain surface accuracy. Thus we allow large hybrid reflectors of combined, formed gores to be made. The second penalty can be reduced by selecting proper canopy configurations to minimize oblique incidence of solar energy and by applying anti-reflection coatings. We will perform a system configuration study and laboratory tests to learn how to do this. Thus we will make viable the replacement of hard reflectors with inexpensive, light-weight, and easily deployed inflatable membranes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"Phase II will carry out a system study of a membrane optics system utilizing inflatably deployed rigidizable conical booms. The boom packaging/deployment concept was conceived by L'Garde and results in a minimum weight system.  It requires essentially zeroadditional mass. The use of rigidizable inflatably deployed booms for deployment of membrane space structures shows great promise because of their light weight and small, conformable, packaged volume.  During Phase I, we applied a very innovative L'Gardepackaging method to a rigidizable inflatably deployed conical tube and accomplished controlled deployment in the laboratory.  The method is scalable and applicable for the deployment of large membrane reflector optics for space applications (~25m). Therigidization system is based on elastomeric like resins that become rigid as the temperature is reduced below its glass transition temperature (Tg).  The boom is deployed when it is above its Tg (and hence flexible) and is operated by passively cooling itbelow its Tg when it becomes rigid.  The rigidization system is being addressed as part of our LRA (Large Radar Antenna) Program with JPL. The program will further address the following issues:  (a) the rigidization system,(b)deployment control,(c) boomgeometric accuracy/repeatability, and (d) resultant membrane reflector surface accuracy.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Planar antenna systems such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Waveguides offer a sophisticated method of providing transmit/receive communications for spacecraft. They have the significant advantage in space of being electronically steerable. From the mechanical viewpoint, the advantage of the tensioned membrane planar concept, in addition to its ultra-lightweight and low packaged volume, is its inherent shape. Relative to parabolic antennas, the requirement to make an accurate doubly curved surface is removed. LGarde is currently working in this area to develop lightweight planar technologies utilizing inflatable and thin film deployable methods.The purpose of this SBIR phase I is to study and identify the structural and rigidization issues specific to the support structure, and address the packaging and deployment issues for this class of planar antenna. Further, to determine the major factors affecting performance, and develop a comprehensive test methodology and plan to fully address these issues. This test plan will be developed and structured so that the most relevant variables influencing system performance will be addressed. Completion of this SBIR will develop the final technology necessary to bring this concept to fruition, that of the ultra-lightweight inflatably deployed rigidizable structures required to deploy and support tensioned membrane planar antennas.",

L?Garde has proposed the novel approach of utilizing an inflated solar concentrator for the high precision requirements of solar propulsion, then rigidizing the reflector and jettisoning the canopy to provide long term solar concentration for space power generation at lower concentration levels. The concept of rigidizing a reflector for space solar concentration was demonstrated by rigidizing a 1m-diameter aluminum laminate reflector and achieving an excellent surface precision of 0.80 mm RMS. Through fabrication and test of high quality test articles, the relative merits of two reflector rigidization concepts, Sub Tg and Aluminum Laminate, were demonstrated and compared. L?Garde strongly recommends proceeding to a Phase II effort, and has developed a comprehensive analysis and test plan to build on the successes of Phase I. L?Garde?s unique mix of skills, experience, design tools, and test hardware will ensure the greatest chance of bringing this very important technology to fruition.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The randomized clinical trial (RCT) is arguably the linchpin of the drug development process, and the results of an RCT are almost always analyzed using some form of statistical hypothesis test. The most frequently used hypothesis tests assume a population model for statistical inference, even though a randomization model is more consistent with real-world characteristics of RCTs. Approximate p- values returned by population-model tests can, under certain circumstances, be misleading, resulting in effective drugs being declared ineffective, or ineffective drugs being declared effective. To support analysis of RCTs using the appropriate randomization model, sophisticated software for conducting randomization-based permutation tests is needed. Ongoing advances in computing technology have created a favorable climate for widespread use of such software. The goal of this research is to develop flexible and robust software for carrying out randomization-based permutation tests for single- or multi- clinic RCTs. A subset of this functionality has been successfully implemented in a Phase I pre-prototype (\"RTAnalyzer\"). Phase II seeks to build a full-scale prototype capable of handling a wide variety of trial designs, including designs using adaptive randomization. The Phase II project includes collaborations with two experts in the field of permutation testing: Dr. William Rosenberger and Dr. Bonnie LaFleur.",

The purpose of this Phase II SBIR proposal is to explore the potential of AMP as an inhibitor of the bitter taste of oral over the counter (OTC) pharmaceuticals. The specific aims of this proposal are designed to evaluate the efficacy of AMP as a bitter taste blocker of OTC pharmaceuticals in an in vitro biochemical assay, two-bottle preference tests utilizing an animal model and by human sensory evaluation.   A blocker of pharmaceutical ingredients bitter taste could lead to more palatable medicines, which could increase patient compliance and provide a source of competitive advantage. Furthermore, tablets and capsules, which can be difficult to swallow for children and the elderly, could be re-formulated into more easily administered solutions. The potential technological innovation from this proposed SBIR would be a greater understanding of the structure-function relationship of bitter taste inhibitors.",

Our Phase I analyses show that properly implemented D3L techniques offer significantperformance and cost advantages over the legacy optical heterodyne and incoherent detection techniques. The program goal is to produce a portable D3L sensor that is capable of detecting 1-m turbulent cells with as low as 10-20 cm/s disturbance velocitiesat greater than 5 km and is compatible with a Future Combat Systems (FCS) sensor suite. LCI will leverage its eyesafe 3D flash-ladar sensor development performed under DARPA's JIGSAW program to define an integrated multifunction combat ID (CID) sensorsuite for an FCS platform. During Phase-II, a prototype D3L sensor will be developed and tested against helicopter targets. The field experiments will be performed in conjunction with AMCOM, and the results will be shared with the FCS primes. PotentialGovernment applications include helicopter signature detection, precision airdrops and ballistic targeting, global winds measurements and weather prediction, environmental monitoring, non-proliferation, chemical and biological standoff detection, and CID.The largest commercial market is aviation safety, which requires sensors for detecting clear-air turbulence (CAT), wind shear, microbursts, and wake-vortices.\"",

The purpose of this effort is to develop a high-power UVlaser system to extend the propagation distance of light filaments, called light-strings, in the atmosphere, and explore military and commercial applications associated with this novel technology. The Phase-I effort has extended our knowledge of pulsepropagation effects in the atmosphere, and has paved the way for the development of new innovative laser and lidar systems to produce and exploit long-distance light filamentation. In Phase-II, we will construct and field-test a high-power UV transmitterfor the purpose of demonstrating long-distance pulse propagation in the atmosphere. The long-term commercialization goal of this project is to develop commercial and military hardware to produce and exploit long-distance light filaments in the atmosphere.Potential applications of light-strings are: (1) lidar sources for measuring the density and distribution of molecular and chemical species in the atmosphere; (2) generating plasma channels for controlled lightning discharge; and (3) generating precisionpoint sources for use as guidestar beacons in adaptive optics systems. Light filaments have potential military utility in chemical and biological stand-off detection, and laser weapons delivery systems (adaptive optics).\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         NASA is actively pursuing the development of technologies that enable satellite-based laser wind sounding. Of particular interest are technologies that enable tropospheric wind profiling at low cost and high efficiency. Traditional laser-based wind sensors utilize coherent-mode detection, which depend on high aerosol concentrations to measure wind fields, and are therefore not suited for tropospheric wind profiling where the aerosol concentration is low. Direct-detection lidars do not suffer from this restriction because they can sense backscattered radiation from moving molecules as well as aerosols. A key component required for direct-detection lidars is a high-power, single-frequency, efficient, conduction-cooled UV laser transmitter. Lite Cycles proposes to develop a high-power (>30 W), efficient (>4% wall-plug), single-frequency (<50 MHz), UV (355-nm) laser transmitter that utilizes our unique conduction-cooled, diode-pumped gain module designs. The Phase I effort will produce a report containing a design trade study and conceptual design for a high-power laser transmitter, and the product of the Phase II effort will be an operational deliverable prototype laser.",

The algorithm will allow us to determine which hypercalciurics need clinical evaluation for osteoporosis and will form the basis of a disease management product. In the process of creating this algorithm, we will be the first to determine the prevalence of bone disease in hypercalciuric stone formers and their families and over time make some estimates of incidence rates. A longer- term goal of our research is to study the genetic underpinnings of osteoporosis and nephrolithasis in these families.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Humans are exposed to genotoxic agents through a variety of sources. Micronucleus (MN) formation is an endpoint which can be used to detect DNA damage resulting from clastogenic or aneugenic mechanisms. A sensitive and high throughput system to measure human blood for MN would have a myriad of biomonitoring applications. For example, such a system could provide information regarding the chromosome damaging activity of new drugs undergoing clinical trials, chemotherapy regimens, as well as accidental radiation or chemical exposures. A goal of the current application is to optimize methods developed during Phase 1 that allow for the flow cytometric measurement of MN in human reticulocytes (RETs0. Experiments are planned to test whether MN-RET measurements represent a sensitive indicator of cytogenetic damage. To achieve this goal, our Phase II aims are to. 1. COMPLETE optimization of cell staining and handling procedures. 2. DEVELOP biological standards to aid the calibration of flow cytometer parameters. 3. MEASURE the time-course and magnitude of MN-RET induction in radiotherapy and radio-plus chemo-therapy patients before and during the course of treatment. 4. MEASURE the time-course and magnitude of MN-RET induction in radiotherapy and radio-plus chemo-therapy patients before and during the course of treatment. 5.  COLLABORATE with researchers in an environmental biomonitoring study of Chernobyl liquidators, clean-up workers and settlers. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The successful completion of this research project will enable Litron Laboratories to become an expert facility, capable of performing cytogenetic measurements on human blood samples on a fee-for-fee service basis. Additionally, by developing the necessary reagents into kit format, it will be possible to make this technology available to other laboratories having access to a single-laser flow cytometer. This technologically innovative technique has the potential to become an important clinical tool for measuring DNA damage carried by environmental exposures: radiation and/or chemotherapeutic therapies, aging and a myriad of other possible sources.",

Three densities were fabricated: 15.3, 10.0, and 4.0 g/cc with mass and dimensional deviations of 0.27 % and 0.3 %, 0.6 % and 0.6 %, and 1.2 % and 1.4 % respectively. Outgassing tests yielded TML's less than 0.06 % and CVCM's less than 0.02 %. Mechanical flex and shear property tests showed the expected increase in modulus with density and strengths sufficient to enable handling without breakage. Data from electron radiation exposure tests and theoretical modeling agreed well for the three densities thus there is confidence in modeling prediction that a 20-mil (0.051 cm) PolyRAD shield can reduce the annual TID in GEO to less than 5 krads/year. These technical performances, combined with its simple and low-cost application to individual parts or large board, are a clear indication that PolyRAD can reliably and cost effectively enable successful commercial and NASA/DOD space applications of state-of-the-art, commercial-off-the-shelf microelectronics. The work planned for Phase II is intended to introduce and apply PolyRAD in the NASA and commercial communities.",

This absorption capability will be developed for applications in the near-infrared using established InGaAs infrared laser sources, however it can be easily employed with any of several new continuous infrared light sources such as cw-OPO, difference frequency sources, and the new Quantum Cascade diode lasers. The innovation we are developing is based in the sample cell and signal analysis end of such instruments. The net result of our innovation is an increase in sample analysis path length of one thousand to ten thousand times. Using our new cell technology, the user is essentially free to employ traditional laser modulation techniques and data analysis as long as the light source frequency modulation remains less than 1 GHz. We will demonstrate the new absorption analysis technique at wavelengths of 1.33 microns in Phase I and demonstrate that the approach can be used with sensitive low power sources such as InGaAs lasers.",

A filter is required to separate the two beams and to provide electron beam diagnostics.  The filter must be thin enough, so as not to impede the electron beam, and highly reflective, in order to perform the beam separation and to resist laser damage.  This project will develop the required filters through the combination of multilayer dielectric technology and ultra-thin substrate technology.  Optical modeling will be used to determine filter composition, and iterative vacuum depositions will be performed to identify the fabrication parameters needed to achieve durable filters that meet the performance specifications.  In Phase I, a freestanding filter, totaling less than 4 microns in physical thickness with a 21-layer dielectric reflector stack, was fabricated and tested.  Reflectance exceeded expectation, demonstrating the feasibility of the filter design.  Because the Phase I filter showed signs of intrinsic stress, Phase II will focus on developing production techniques that yield durable filters, optimal for the intended application.  The filters will also be extensively characterized, both mechanically and optically.               Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new filters should have application to electron beam diagnostic filters, infrared band pass filters and beam splitters, adaptive optics for ground and space observatories, and filters for optical fiber communication networks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Metalized polyimide films have become a standard for soft x-ray filters due to polyimides strength and thermal stability. Utilization of polyimide support has led to increasingly larger and thinner filters, and throughput on missions such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory has been increased significantly. Newer missions such as Constellation-X require higher transmission across a large range of energies. To achieve greater transmission, next generation filters must look to even more advanced materials. The proposed innovation is to reinforce ultra-thin polyimide with extremely high strength materials such as Kevlar (polyaramid) or carbon fibers, to create a robust composite filter. At low x-ray energies (< 600 eV), the reinforcing fiber structure will have significantly higher transmission than the often-required metal mesh which it would replace. At higher energies above 3 keV, the Kevlar or carbon reinforcement will be nearly invisible, and improvements in mission throughput will be even more significant. In all cases it is expected that the increase in transmittance will be 10% or greater. The goal of this Phase I effort will be to show the feasibility of producing these types of composite materials for use in future x-ray astronomy missions and other Astrophysical Observing Systems",

The results also demonstrated that this method for ammonia production has the potential to reduce production costs thus significantly lowering the cost of fertilizer (80 percent of the ammonia produced is converted to fertilizer) reducing the financial burden on the agricultural community. During the Phase I effort Lynntech's researchers overcame not only the difficulties associated with the chemistry but also many of the difficulties associated with the engineering. Many of the cell components were engineered using new techniques developed in house by Lynntech's technical staff. The goal of the Phase II effort is to use the technical know-how gained in the Phase I to build and test a prototype ammonia generator capable of producing 1 kg of ammonia per day. Lynntech is recognized as a leader in innovative electrochemical cell design and manufacture. The prototype developed during the Phase II research effort will be used as a commercialization tool to promote the technology to commercial partners. The specific objectives of the Phase H effort will be to: 1.Design the electrochemical reactor and corresponding sub-systems. This Task will be used to evaluate cell design for optimum gas flow for reactants and product separation, thermal properties, and general ease of use. During this Task, materials for the cell construction will be evaluated 2.Electrochemical ammonia cell fabrication. Based on the information from Task 1 the cell frames, end plates, and electrodes will be machined and assembled into one unit. 3.Testing the prototype system. The aim of this Task is to establish the optimum operational parameters. 4.Build the final prototype system. Based on the information the final prototype demonstration unit will be assembled. 5.Economic evaluation and final documentation. During this Task, Lynntech will assemble all documentation regarding the operation and maintenance of the electrochemical ammonia generator. 6.Deliver Final Technical Report.",

However, many liquid sterilants are stored as highly-concentrated, hazardous, unstable solutions that are costly to transport.This Phase II SBIR proposal describes a novel formulation consisting of a solid powder that when dissolved in water can sterilize dental instruments in 10 minutes at room temperature.  In Phase I, six novel peroxygen compounds were synthesized andisolated.  The capability of dilute solutions of these compounds to sterilize dental instruments contaminated with spores, bacteria, or fungi was demonstrated.  Also, dental instruments exposed to 1,000 equivalent sterilization cycles showed no significantdamage.In the Phase II research, the novel compounds will be fully characterized in accordance with the requirements of a 510(k) submission to the FDA.  This characterization includes antimicrobial efficacy, simulated use testing, shelf-life stability, and invivo and in vitro toxicity testing.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft, offer unique combinations of capabilities for use as observation and relay platforms. They operate closer to the ground and at lower cost than satellites, while being capable of staying over a small area for extended periods and remaining aloft for extended periods. The current generation of vehicles for fixed duration operations are based on conventional turbine or piston technology and have flight times limited to one or two days. There are no potential improvements that could extend this time to a week or longer. Missions of this duration can be achieved by electrically driven craft using liquid hydrogen fuel with a lightweight proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell to generate electricity using ambient air as the oxygen source. Fuel cells have adequate performance for this application without the need for precompression, as used with combustion engines, even when operated at the low pressures present at high altitudes (2 psia at 50,000 ft), but current densities are limited, requiring high active areas. Success requires lighter fuel cell hardware than is currently available. The proposed project will demonstrate a novel fuel cell architecture that substantially reduces the weight of a fuel cell stack.",

The challenge is the development of low cost andportable methods for sequencing DNA and RNA extracted from surfaces and fluids, to recognize exposure to biowarfare agents.  All the conventional techniques are based on DNA/RNA hybridization to a complementary DNA sequence of interest anchored to asurface.  The proposed method is based on electrophoretically separating and directing a single DNA/RNA molecule fragment of interest through a simple, self-assembled nanopore detector.  The method implies unprecedented sensitivity and uncomplicateddetection of each nucleobase and will offer a rapid, direct \"reading\" of a single DNA or RNA molecule as it passes through the detector.  In Phase I work to date, detection of DNA has been accomplished with AC-impedance spectroscopy, severalelectrochemical redox species that interact with DNA have been identified, nanopores have been inserted in membrane bilayers using a-hemolysin for DNA/RNA transport, and a unique sampling system for potential biological warfare agents has been developed.The Phase II project will provide and optimize integration of sampling and detection steps, increased speed and sensitivity, and further miniaturization of \"on-chip\" analysis in a field device.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         New environmental regulations have identified many of the currently used oxidizing agents employed for industrial waste control, disinfection, and wastewater treatment as a caveat that must be addressed. Ferrate has potential for becoming the alternative of choice because of its aggressive oxidation properties and its negligible impact on the environment. However, there has been little industrial interest in ferrate because of the high cost of production. All known methods of ferrate synthesis are extremely expensive and hence, less effective oxidizing agents that are much more affordable to produce are commonly employed. During Phase I, Lynntech, Inc., developed an environmentally benign electrochemical process for the production of greater than 98 percent pure potassium ferrate that is at least one-tenth the cost of conventional methods. The most attractive features of this process are its reliance on low-cost starting materialsmost of which are recyclable, and the elimination of expensive ion exchange membranes. Utilizing continuous magnetic separation of ferrate from the electrochemical cell ensures that this process is ideally suited for industrial use. In Phase II, Lynntech, Inc., proposes to optimize ferrate production and extraction to develop a continuous, online system for yearly production of up to 100 kg of high-purity product. This project involves a collaborative effort between Lynntech, Inc., and leading companies in the specialty chemicals industry to develop this innovative process of ferrate production for implementation in the commercial marketplace. Widespread applications of oxidizing agents range from disinfection and sterilization to wastewater treatment and removal of hazardous waste materials as well as batteries and catalytic synthesis of explosives. However, many of the currently available oxidants are limited by the requirement of harmful starting materials or the generation of large volumes of negative-value byproducts. Ferrate has been shown to be effective in many of these applications, where the only byproduct of oxidation is environmentally benign rust. Lynntech, Inc., already has demonstrated the effectiveness of ferrate utilization in aluminum conversion coatings and nuclear waste remediation, which have combined markets in excess of $4 billion.",

Current technologies based upon ELISAs can not meet NASA needs as it only quantitate a single protein at a time. Due to the complicated procedure for antibody immobilization, limited stability, and poor compatibility for biological materials have strongly diminished the apparent attraction of immuno-sensors. Other newly emerging techniques in the field of proteiomics depend upon mass spectrometry methods thus require extensive laboratory support and equipment. These limitations could be overcome by using artificial receptors, which mimic the active sites of antibodies. During the Phase I, Lynntech has prepared sensor elements capable of recognizing different proteins selectively from complex biological samples. Results obtained in Phase I have demonstrated the feasibility of miniatuarization of this technology with minimal power requirements. The proposed research will result in a light weight, hand held device capable of specific recognition of small concentrations of target proteins from biological fluids at the end of Phase II and will be delivered to NASA/JSC. The rapid and simultaneous quantitation of a large number of proteins in biological fluids will become a valuable tool in clinical diagnostics.",

Both sensors will be incorporated into a microfluidic design and will be integrated into a single instrument easily adapted to current bioreactors (in space or rotating wall bioreactors on Earth) for on-line detection. Both sensors will use a relatively simple signal transduction system based on AC impedance. The instrument will also incorporate a sampling and separation module. The operation of the proposed instrument will be mostly automated. A compatibility of the proposed system with microgravity conditions will be tested by monitoring cell growth/induced apoptosis in rotating wall bioreactors. Compatibility of the design instrument may be also tested with existing spaceflight hardware. At the end of the Phase II, a working prototype will be delivered to NASA.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The availability of safe drinking water is a significant health concern. The introduction of chlorination as a disinfection method caused a large drop in mortality from water borne diseases and was considered a major public health advance. Unfortunately, disinfection byproducts (DPBs) are formed when chlorine and other disinfectants are used in water treatment plants. Many disinfection byproducts can have serious health effects and are potential carcinogens. Current treatment options to minimize DPBs in drinking water are either inadequate or too costly to implement. A potential means to combat exposure to DPBs is through the widespread implementation of treatment methods near to the place where water is consumed (i.e., point-of-use treatment). In Phase I, we demonstrated a point-of-use water treatment device based on photocatalytic oxidation. The method has a high potential to degrade DPBs to benign end products and provide safe drinking water at a cost lower than current treatment options. Significant accomplishments of the Phase I study included demonstration of the device's potential for mass production as well as its multiple applications, including control of microbial contaminants. The Phase II will focus on optimization of the device's design and capabilities.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: There are many economic advantages to the point-of-use water purification method described in this proposal.  The proposed device can be used as a stand alone treatment method, or its commercial potential may be enhanced by integrating it with siilar water purification devices that are used by millions of consumers in the U.S.  The market opportunity is substantial, given the large number of point-of-use devices that are used in health care facilities, homes, restaurants, food service establishments and hotels.  The market is estimated to be worth over $1.5 billion annually in the U.S.  Lynntech is well positioned to commercialize this technology, having secured intellectual property covering many aspects of the invention.  Additionally, Lynntech's management team is experienced in commercializing new technology related to water treatment, healthcare and consumer products.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many reported risks and hazards in              hemodialysis are associated with water quality, including pyrogenic                  contamination. The typical patient on dialysis is exposed to between 30 to 40        times the amount of water to which a member of the general population is             exposed. Thus, the quality of hemodialysis water is obviously very important.        Current practices in hemodialysis systems do not guarantee pyrogen-free water.       Several drawbacks exist in using available procedures to achieve pyrogen-free        water: (i) addition of chemicals, which have to be monitored and destroyed           before the water contacts the dialysis membrane. Otherwise, the chemicals may        come in contact with the patient about blood; (ii) formation of toxic                by-products from the reaction of pyrogens with the disinfectant; (iii) no            on-line means of providing pyrogen-free water (i.e., batch-mode operation), and      (iv) cost. This project concerns the development and evaluation of an                efficient, fast, and cost-effective photoreactor to supply pyrogen-free water        on-line in hemodialysis system. The disinfecting agents are short-lived              hydroxyl radicals, one of the strongest oxidants known, which are produced           in-situ, and consumed inside the photoreactor. During the Phase II project, an       automated prototype system will be developed and integrated into a hemodialysis      system. Technical and cost evaluations will be carried out to provide the            foundation for a commercial system.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Pyrogen-free water is required in all hemodialysis systems. In addition, this technology will find application in other areas of the medical industry: large quantities of pyrogen-free water are required for intravenous infusion fluids, fluids for injection and for irrigation in operating rooms. Also, other industries, such as the hydroponics industry need sterile water.",

The isotope is produced at a\r centralized location and shipped to users worldwide.\r \r The generator proposed here will permit the production of the desired isotope\r locally in a hospital or regional radiopharmacy where it can be used\r immediately. Phase I identified two inorganic ion exchange materials that can\r be loaded with a \"cow\" of 90Sr and \"milked\" to produce a carrier-free solution\r of 90Y ready for immediate use. In Phase II this technology will be further\r refined and used in the design of a generator capable of delivering a useful\r quantity of 90Y on a weekly basis in a chemical form suitable for\r radiopharmaceutical applications.

There is a need for the development of a new catalyst that decomposes CINCH fuel at temperatures as low as --40 degrees F and a gas generator using this catalyst and fuel.  Thisresearch and development effort will accomplish both of these objectives.Working under a Phase I SBIR, MACH I has identified several new catalytic materials  more reactive than iridium.  These include: palladium metal, palladium chloride, palladium nitrate, iron chloride, iron bromide, nanoscale iron oxide, and tin chloride.Strongly acidic supports are favored over neutral or basic supports.In the proposed Phase II program, a commercial source of  catalyst and gas generators will be developed from this new fundamental technology.  We will identify the best catalyst compositions using classical catalyst optimization techniques looking for anybimetallic synergies.

The current paradigm of using cell lines or patient specimens for quality assurance is unsatisfactory because materials are unstable, potentially infectious, of limited supply, and cannot be processed through routine test extractions. Patient confidentiality is problematic and each specimen has only one genotype, thus making control of multiplex tests, including gene chips, prohibitively expensive. Phase II will produce synthetic, stable, non-infectious, multi-analyte controls for quality assurance of molecular-based leukemia tests. Feasibility of our novel approach was demonstrated by Phase I production of stable, cationic liposome-complexed RNA, useful as controls in BCR-ABL clinical tests. Phase II manufacture of a comprehensive Leukemia Control Set begins by creating seven additional clone banks containing leukemic gene segments. RNA will be produced in vitro and stabilized with liposome complexes generated by Phase I proprietary techniques. Reference gene segments will be incorporated to render controls useful for minimal residual disease quantification tests used to direct therapies. The proposed project makes a significant contribution to the support and implementation of critical molecular tests for leukemia.",

Adoption of molecular diagnostics technology is inhibited by lack of commercial quality controls. Patient-based materials are often used as controls, which presents issues of patient confidentiality, infection risk and limited supply. Phase I research demonstrated feasibility of an innovative system for production of stable, renewable, noninfectious controls. In Phase II, constructs will be engineered to contain 16 medically important CF gene segments that carry forty-seven common CF diagnostic mutations. A unique cassette scheme for assembly of segments will yield a construct easily modified to accommodate new molecular tests. The construct will be stabilized by a proprietary technology and suspended in a biological matrix to mimic patient samples. Our control set will validate CF diagnostic assays and will serve as a model system to produce quality assurance products for genetic tests designed to detect multiple mutations. The availability of these products is important to medical diagnostics and makes a significant contribution to patient care by ensuring quality of genetic testing results.

This project is adapting fundamental MEMS and microchannel fabrication technologies developed at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) to key chemical reaction processes common to most proposed ISRU schemes, namely, the conversion of water to hydrogen and oxygen and the reduction of carbon oxides. This project also seeks to use microchannel and MEMS technologies as means of achieving integration of system components, such as filters, valves and instrumentation, with key chemical processing steps, such as reaction bed, product separation and thermal management systems. The goal of the program is to develop technology which addresses NASA's needs for missions, such as the Mars Sample Return Mission and propellant production for the Mars Accent Vehicle. This Phase I program will develop a prototype integrated miniature ISRU system for the production of methane, oxygen, and other useful chemicals from carbon dioxide and hydrogen.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Develop device to increase exercise walking in patients with knee, hip, balance or other problems. Exercise walking has been shown to have significant health benefits. However, many older adults avoid  walking due to pain, fear from falls or other problems. Device based on prototypes developed for running. Like crutches, they allow the entire body weight to be supported by the poles. Like canes, they are comfortable to use for extended periods.   In Phase 1 we conducted initial trials of the exercise poles with healthy elderly adults, to access the kinematics, changes in stability and impact on well being. We also developed questionnaires and improved prototypes. In Phase 2 we will conduct a 2 year longitudinal study using a group of 200 subjects age 65-85 who are non-exercisers. Testing refined prototypes against a control group and existing crutch, cane and walker designs, we will determine effectiveness for different elderly populations, optimize the design, and create the required educational materials for health care professionals. We expect this device will increase elderly exercise walking rates and have a measurable impact on the users overall health, sense of well being, mastery of their environment and instrumental activities of daily living.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Over 16 million Americans over 65 do not exercise, despite significant health benefits. Walking is perhaps the most highly regarded exercise by both health professionals and the elderly. A significant number of elderly likely avoid walking due to pain or fear of falling. By creating an assistive device significantly more comfortable and better looking than standard crutches, we foresee a market of 2.5 million seniors. This is a $40-100 million dollar a year market.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Technological improvements in biochemical mass spectrometry have changed the way biomolecules are examined. No longer are scientists relying solely on gels or other methods that have a high degree of error and a low degree of specificity. Yet even given the broad success of techniques such as electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) there is still significant potential for improvement to address biochemical problems. A new and promising strategy for mass spectrometry, laser desorption/ionization from a porous silicon surface, is a marriage between micromaterial fabrication and microchemical approaches combined with laser-based desorption ionization techniques. Desorption/ionization on silicon (DIOS) uses porous silicon to trap analytes deposited on the surface and UV laser radiation is absorbed by the silicon surface facilitating vaporization and ionization. Preliminary experiments with DIOS-MS on biomolecules have allowed for the generation of intact molecular ions with little or no fragmentation and sensitivity at least as high as MALDI-MS. The primary goal of the proposed research is to optimize porous silicon preparation for a large variety of biomolecules, high throughput applications, and ultimately for the large-scale manufacture of these surfaces. Given the tremendous growth in mass spectrometry-based applications for biomolecule analysis, new technology that could further improve on small molecule analysis and compatibility with microfluidics and silicon microchip technology as well as impurity tolerance, sensitivity, and automation will have an enormous impact in the biological sciences.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Given the tremendous growth in mass spectrometry-based applications for biomolecule analysis, new technology, such as desorption ionization on silicon (DIOS), that further improves mass spectrometry's compatibility with microfluidics and silicon microchip technology as well as in impurity tolerance, sensitivity, and automation will have an enormous impact in the pharmaceutical industry and biological sciences.",

Along with the ability to absorb mechanical energy, they can perfectlydissipate heat energy. The unique combination of low density, highly developed inner surface and low pressure drop of the metal foams produced by the developed technique makes possible their multifunctional use. Thermomechanical properties of these foamssuggest their implementation in ultralight structures and for heat dissipation media.

One reasonable way to enhance the mass behind the nose of the penetrator is to augment its size. Theconflict between increased lethality for large projectiles and limited facilities for producing large penetrators leads to a need to join small pieces of heavy alloy into larger projectiles. Conventional methods to bond heavy alloy either use joiningmaterials that are not strong enough, or require such a high temperature that grain coarsening occurs with a resulting significant decrease in the joint strength. A better bonding method uses an interlayer consisting of high strength multicomponent alloys.These materials possess high strength and ductility. They have good adhesion to the heavy alloy and form strong ductile joints. Bonding of heavy alloy through the use of a high strength alloyed joint occurs at a temperature significantly lower than that ofthe W-Ni-Fe eutectic melting point. This excludes the possibility of grain coarsening and loss of mechanical properties of the heavy alloy. The strength of the joint is measured to be at least 87% of the bulk heavy alloy strength and there are projectedresults that will exceed it.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65659       Meso carbon micro beads (MCMB) produce the best performing anode for lithium-ion batteries, but their expense limits the wide spread use of these batteries.  The MCMB expense results from the use of an expensive synthetic mesophase pitch, available only from overseas sources, plus extensive processing.  This project will develop domestic source pitches for synthesizing MCMBs.  The refined domestic source pitch will provide a precursor for producing MCMBs, as well as other carbon forms, at substantial cost savings and also will provide improved lithium-ion battery performance.  In Phase I, domestic source coal tar and petroleum pitches and pitch extracted directly from coal were purified and converted to mesophase pitch.  The mesophase pitch was utilized to produce MCMBs at substantially lower costs while providing equivalent lithium-ion battery performance.  Another form of carbon was produced from the mesophase which is more economical than MCMBs and provide improved lithium-ion battery performance.  In Phase II, an improved, low cost process to produce mesophase from domestic pitches will be optimized and scaled up to 10-100kg batch sizes.  The mesophase pitch will be utilized to produce MCMBs by an alternate low cost process, as well as the alternate form of carbon which has demonstrated improved lithium-ion battery performance.            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Low cost lithium-ion batteries with improved performance should have wide spread applications in hand-held electronics, electric vehicles of all types, and a variety of defense and commercial applications for secondary batteries.",

A new type of carbon nanotube with two tubular layers (double-wall carbon nanotube, DWNT) shows improved physical properties over previous nanotube structures; however, an efficient method to selectively produce this unique carbon nanotube structure is needed.  This project will develop an understanding of the mechanism of DWNT production, leading to optimum methods for maximizing production and material quality.  In Phase I, DWNT production was optimized in an arc-based reactor.  In addition, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) DWNT reactor was constructed and successfully demonstrated.  Purified DWNT samples, with controlled diameters from 1.3 to 6 nm, were prepared and shown to have excellent field emission properties.  Phase II will scale up the arc reach and develop a continuous CVD reactor for high production rate, high purity DWNT products.  The purification process will be further developed to improve throughput, and a comparison of various DWNT types will be made.                 Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  DWNTs have been demonstrated to be more conductive and more resistant to thermal decomposition compared to multi- or single-wall carbon nanotubes.  DWNTs should have application as electron field emitters and as atomic force microscope probe tips.  Since DWNTs have superior electrical conductivity, they are excellent candidates as connectors in nanocircuitry and MEMS tech-nology.

Current SiC mirror technologies suffer from several shortcomings including high areal density, impurities, low stiffness, and core/base print-through which has precluded producing acceptable SiC mirrors.   This project will develop a hybrid SiC-SiC composite/SiC foam approach to address these limitations.  The use of the composite core will provide high thermal conductivity, very high modulus/stiffness, high fracture toughness, and a pure -SiC structure.  The SiC foam will eliminate the print-through problem.   During Phase I, a 4-inch diameter SiC mirror was fabricated that exhibited less than 10 kg/m2 areal density.  The core print-through was eliminated, and a very good microroughness of 4 nm was achieved.   Phase II will scale-up processing to 18-inch diameter SiC optics suitable for Inertial Fusion Energy optics.  Final polishing techniques will be developed to achieve a flatness under 150 nm combined with 2 nm microroughness.

Through the course of achieving these objectives, commercial opportunities will be pursued. This approach potentially permits the fabrication of extremely large ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) structures never before possible in much the same manner as large polymer matrix aircraft structures and boat hulls are currently manufactured. The commercial application will be the fabrication of extremely large CMC structures that can be used in the aircraft industry",

The linked engineering knowledge base to be developed, demonstrated and validated under the Phase II research program will be based on the Mathematica style notebook interface.Individual modules that simulate microstructural behavior will provide input to structured material modules whose output are macro- or structural-level properties.  Generation of limited data at any of the levels can then be expected to provide (limited)validation at other levels and, the total amount of testing required to characterize a new textile fiber reinforced material can be reduced.  Data interpretation tools, a database function and on-line documentation will be included in the tool-set.Experimental validation of the tool-set and a software publishing and commercialization strategy are outlined in this Phase II proposal.\"",

The tool can handle the complex geometry and boundary conditions found in typical joints, and has been shown to be exceptionally accurate.  An easy-to-use front end to the code was also demonstrated.  In addition, Materials Sciences Corporation (MSC) proposed new approaches to understanding the mechanics of adhesive failure as a function of adhesive thickness.  GA aircraft sometimes use thicker adhesive than would be recommended for optimum strength.  A model based on nonlocal damage mechanics was developed that appears to explain the observed test data with a minimum of empirical constants.  The Phase II program is intended to combine improved adhesive mechanics models with the analytic code, and to bring the code to maturity in preparation for release.  In addition, validation data will be generated using typical joints as produced by a GA manufacturer.",

A proprietary microwave plasma synthesis technique was adopted to reduce these nanospheres and the feasibility of the technique was established during Phase I. Process scale up and extensive cell/DNA isolation testing will be the main R&D; objectives for the Phase II project. Industrial partners will evaluate beads produced to evaluate parameters, which are critical for transitioning the technology to an immediate useful product. The commercial potential of polymer coated nanospheres can be used in various separation modules. This technology could also be extended to isolation and detection of pathogens in water.",

In Phase I, MSI is optimizing the application and polishing of index-matching glass coatingsand replicating optically-smooth surfaces using polished mandrels.  The optical properties (in-line transmittance and image resolution) of resulting windows have been measured. A number of very promising glass-coated sapphire samples have been produced,demonstrating the feasibility of MSI's approach.  These samples have in-line transmittance up to 88% and image resolution less than 1 mrad, exceeding the optical goals established for Phase II.  In Phase II, MSI will scale-up the most successful low-costoptical finishing processes to 12 x 14 inch windows while maintaining the optical quality goals of the program.  In order to produce and deliver 12 x 14 inch windows, it may be necessary to take advantage of MSI's sapphire edge bonding technology, whichwas developed previously under separate funding.  Commercialization of the low cost finishing technology will be facilitated through MSI's on-going business relationships with BF Goodrich (formerly Raytheon Optical Systems - Danbury CT), RaytheonElectronic Systems (Lexington, MA), and as a result of interest expressed by the US Secret Service.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Phase I research demonstrated that a Langerhans cell (LC) containing model of the epidermis is feasible.  LC progenitor cells were harvested from peripheral or cord blood samples, cryopreserved, and matured using cytokines into the LC specific CD1a+ phenotype.  By modifying the extracellular matrix substrate, these cells were successfully incorporated into a highly differentiated, serum-free epidermal model, albeit at a lower density than in native epidermis.  The LC derived from cord blood maintained their dendntic, CD1a+ HLA-DR+/- phenotype and expressed Birbeck granules within the cultures.  The exposure of 2 contact allergens resulted in the release of TNF-a and IL-lb. 2 cytokines known to be critically involved in the initial stages of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).  Exposure to the common irritant, on the other hand, did not result in TNF-a or IL- lb release.  In addition, following exposure to UV irradiation, immuno-staining showed that LC were migrating out of the tissue, as is known to occur in vivo.Phase II studies will expand on the Phase I results to further develop an epidermal model containing immunologically competent cells.  Initial research will focus on the optimization of culture conditions to improve LC incorporation into the tissue model.  The effects of allergens on cytokine release and gene expression will be investigated.  Experiments designed to model LC migration from skin following exposure to allergens or UV light and subsequent T-cell activation will be performed to determine the degree to which the model's behavior corresponds to in vivo ACD reactions.  Finally, based on these studies, an assay kit to predict whether a material is likely to act as a contact allergen will be developed.",

Further development and optimization of this cathode material, including processing of the electrode, should merit this system for NASA missions (GEO, LEO and Terrestrial). This Phase II effort proposes to further the development of two types of crystalline V2O5 (bulk crystalline and nanocrystalline) and two types of amorphous V2O5. Continued effort on this cathode technology will focus on the synthesis and optimization of the materials, characterizations of the materials at the 15-350 mAh cell level, determinations of the optimum windows for each specific materials with respect to achieving long cycle life, and the development of a 5 Ah cell prototype as the cell deliverables.

These units will use onlypresently available, low cost instruments and will provide a highdegree of protection against jamming of the GPS receiver.  Ourpartner in carrying out this program is Synetics, Inc.We are considering the \"Accelerometers Only\" (AO) inertialnavigator concept in the Phase II program.  This navigator doesnot require gyros; it uses only accelerometers which arepresently available as low-cost, gun-hard COTS devices.  Althoughthis program will focus on the AO navigator, much of the resultswill be applicable to a system using a conventional INS as well.Thus a very similar system could be considered for application toERGM or other gliding projectiles.BENEFITS: The proposed R & D effort will result in the flight qualified, low-cost tactical GEU with high anti-jam capability.  The proposed system will use commercial instruments, to keep the production cost low.  This GEU will be suitable for use ingun-launched projectiles including ANSR and ERGM vehicles.  Other pot",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Applicant?s abstract): Although the murine Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) is effective at detecting potential irritants/sensitizers, this assay, in its current standard form: 1) cannot readily differentiate some types of irritants from respiratory and contact sensitizers; 2) utilizes moderate amounts of radioactive material and; 3) requires increased numbers of animals to determine the different endpoints (i.e., proliferation, immunophenotype) to fully characterize the response of an animal to a topically-applied chemical. To enhance and improve this important test, our company has implemented several innovative modifications to the standard LLNA. We have applied flow cytometric techniques to this assay to increase the sensitivity/specificity of the assay, eliminate the use of radioactive material and decrease the number of animals used for screening. It has been determined by the results of SBIR Phase I studies that the proposed enhanced flow cytometry-based LLNA is technically and commercially feasible. However, to develop this assay to its full commercial potential, which our company would provide to the chemical, pharmaceutical and consumer products industries, our group must: 1) validate the enhanced version of the LLNA; 2) establish the cytometry-based LLNA as a GLP compliant assay at our company and; 3) develop and provide various versions of the enhanced LLNA for our clients.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A variable compliance chamber (VCC) is proposed to control pulmonary input impedance during the treatment of pulmonary disease. Pulmonary impedance is related to the total work the right heart must pump against, and it is altered (primarily in the form of decreased compliance) in pulmonary disease and in the implantation of oxygenation assisted devices; this increase in work can lead to right-heart failure. The VCC can be attached to the right-heart or combined with an artificial lung to decrease the impedance seen by the right ventricle. One application of the VCC will be to augment bridge-to-transplant or recovery treatment of patients suffering from primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension. In Phase I, the optimal geometry and material of the compliant chamber were determined, fabrication techniques were developed, the compliance of the chambers were measured, and two methods for varying the compliance of the chamber were developed and characterized in an in vitro circuit. The objective of Phase II is to construct a clinically feasible VCC device, and to demonstrate and fully characterize its application in controlling pulmonary impedance in an in vivo animal model. At Phase II conclusion, manufacturability of the VCC will be defined, and the in vivo performance of the VCC will be thoroughly detailed as both an independent device, and as a device that augments the performance of the MC3 paracorporeal artificial lung (PAL).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The overall goal of this Phase II project is to extend and refine the web- based client-server software system (\"JavaSCAN [TM]\"), which was successfully created and shown feasible in Phase I.  As planned, the system was implemented using a Java client and a web database server, and Sections 11 (\"Use of Alcohol\") and 12 (\"Use of Psychoactive Substances other than Alcohol\") from the World Health Organization (WHO) Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN version 2.1) were used as the basis for semi-structured standardized clinical assessment of alcohol and other drug use, abuse, and dependence. Phase II efforts address identified market needs.  Based upon Phase I experiences, additional functionality is planned to create a useful product for the substance abuse and dependence research markets, including clinical trials. Two important areas in which this software system can serve are (1) assessment (data collection process) and (2) research administration (project management). Assessment functions address: study of co-morbidity, enhanced temporal measurement, established psychometrics, and diagnostic classification. Research administration functions address: organizing research centers, projects, staff, and subjects; and multi-center distribution and management of the assessment process and data management. To meet these needs, Phase II Aims are: (1) addition of other SCAN sections to support studies of co-morbidity; (2) extension of the data model and interface to support enhanced temporal measurement; (3) study of psychometric performance; (4) integration of automated diagnostic classification functions; and (5) implementation of functions and user interfaces for project and data management across multiple sites.  Field testing will be carried out at Washington University in St. Louis. The proposed system has potential to lead to further (Phase III and beyond) innovations in alcohol, drug, and mental health research and services by fostering efficient standardization of assessment, thus helping create centralized and pooled clinical databases.  Such databases would in turn provide a basis for further research and technical developments, such as scientific management and optimization of assessment and decision-making, or in linking community activities and university research.",

Approximately 60-70% of adolescent smokers express a desire to quit, but the majority is not successful. The Buddies program is designed to provide social support and skills training to adolescent smokers to help them quit smoking within the context of a fun-to-play game involving real-time chat and mini-games.   The first primary aim is to finish development of the existing Phase I prototype. The second primary aim is to test the usability of a working prototype in an Interaction Design Laboratory. The third aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of Buddies OnLine by recruiting 440 past week smokers aged 13-17 from 10 sites in different states; coordinated by the American Lung Association of Minnesota. Smokers within each site will be randomized to one of two conditions: Buddies Online game or Internet cessation information and support. The primary outcome is biochemically confirmed self-reported 3-month follow-up abstinence. If shown effective in helping adolescents to quit smoking, the Buddies Online program holds great promise in providing a fun and effective alternative for adolescent smokers wanting to quit. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Currently, Medical Works' Smoking Web-delivered game is one of very few in development.  Our design will be created with the goal of positioning the 'Buddies OnLine' Internet game as a standard in educational health care.  The potential buyers of 'Buddies OnLine' will be youths who smoke, parents, teachers, school districts, educational and probation facilities, public health departments, hospitals, HMOs, disease prevention societies, community based organizations, medical educators and physicians that have access to the Internet.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): This study will examine the use of timed        image acquisition, wavelength filtered light and ace to whitening kinetics to        improve the accuracy of colposcopy for the routine clinical diagnosis of             cervical cancer. A colposcopy workstation will be built with enhanced software       and wavelength filtered light capability to collect necessary patient data.                                                                                               A cohort of 25 patients with high grade Cervical Intraepitheliel Neoplasia (C/N      II/III will be imaged with the modified I workstation to quantify how these          image enhancements improve the predictive value of colposcopy. The                   time-dependent and spectral data will be used to improve the accuracy of             colposcopy in the discrimination of high grade lesions from other conditions         including low grade lesions (C/NI) and normal tissue.                                                                                                                     A time-sequenced series of images will be collected after the uniform and timed      application of 5 percent acetic acid onto the cervix. Images will be processed       to find predictive markers such as (1) lifetime and intensity of acetowhitening and  resulting temporal decay curves, and (2) spectral changes in reflectance due to  acetowhitening.  Techniques will be improved for the processing and analysis of  temporal curves to enhance their predictive value.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Completion of this Phase I program will lay the groundwork for significantly improved digital  colposcopic instrumentation.  The timed spectral images of cervical acetowhitening will  improve the quality of clinical treatment while reducing costs.  As with any new technology,  market commercialization will depend on the willingness of physicians to accept the new             technology.  The device developed in this application, however, is similar to existing   colposcopes, and the barrier to acceptance should be less as users in the OB/Gyn   community are familiar with this equipment.  The device will allow for improved accuracy  in the mapping and grading of cervical cancer.",

This is necessary to confirm the predicted favorable characteristics of: multiple, Tesla-series connected, bifilar-wound metal ribbons around flexible magneticcores worn around the back half of the waist at VHF, as well as the significant computed ability of shoulder-worn artificial dielectric ground planes to enhance the gain performance of short, vertically polarized elements at UHF. The optimum type ofsoldier-position dependent switching (mechanical, PIN diode or FET-MMIC) between several of these enhanced UHF antennas mounted on or near the shoulders will also be determined by additional analysis and experiment during the proposed effort.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65043      Although U.S. refineries are short of hydrogen, many untapped sources exist, including off-gas and fuel gas streams that are generated on site.  Membranes have been used to separate hydrogen from these gases, but many membrane modules are needed; therefore, the footprint and complexity of the membrane plants are excessive.  This project will develop a new type of membrane module that will be 10 times larger than the current industry standard.  These large modules will allow large refining gas streams to be treated with compact equipment.  In Phase I, detailed designs for the large-membrane-area modules were developed and several prototype large modules were prepared.  The largest module produced, with a membrane area three times that of the current industry standard, exhibited appropriate gas permeation flow rates and was defect-free.  The absence of a measurable permeate-side pressure drop validated the design approach.  Phase II will further improve the design and produce even larger membrane modules.  Existing test equipment will be modified to allow for high-pressure testing.  A field test of the large-membrane-area modules will be performed in the second year with support from an industrial Phase II collaborator.            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Much larger membrane modules should allow membrane processes to be more widely used in hydrogen separation, as well as in other gas and liquid separations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Ships generate large volumes of bilge and ballast water that contain high concentrations of emulsified and free-phase oil as well as suspended solids. To meet new environmental regulations, this water will require treatment to reduce the oil content to less than 15 ppm before overboard discharge. Treatment by ultrafiltration can produce dischargeable water, but currently available membranes are subject to severe fouling by oil and particulates. The objective of this project is to develop a bilge water treatment process by combining a centrifugal separator pretreatment step to remove solids and large oil droplets, and a novel, fouling-resistant composite ultrafiltration membrane-polishing step to remove the remaining emulsified and dissolved oil and produce dischargeable water that meets the new regulations. In Phase I, Membrane Technology and Research, Inc., demonstrated the technical feasibility of the process. The system removed all of the free-phase oil and some of the dissolved organic compounds from the waste stream to produce dischargeable water. Fouling resistance of the new membrane was considerably better than that of commercial ultrafiltration membranes. An economic analysis showed that the capital and operating costs of the process are substantially lower than alternatives. Discussions were held with potential partners for Phase II field tests and Phase III commercialization activities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, or white mold, is a resilient and devastating disease that has emerged as a significant threat to many of the broadleaf crops of the United States. Sclerotinia is known to infect about 408 species of plants. It has been estimated to cause hundreds of millions of dollars in losses annually to the United States' dry edible bean, sunflower, canola, and soybean crops. The disease has been especially problematic in the Upper Midwest, where the proliferation of susceptible crops has led to fewer economically viable resistant crop rotation options. The development and spread of white mold is highly dependent upon the weather. The prevailing weather conditions largely determine the reproductive nature of the fungus as well as its ability to infect plants. Available fungicides offer many susceptible crops protection from the disease. However, dwindling agricultural profit margins and the related growth in farm size make it increasingly impractical for producers to routinely scout and monitor all of their fields for impending disease problems. This is especially true in the regions hardest hit by the disease, where it is no longer uncommon for the various fields of a given farm to spread across areas of well over 100 square miles. Further, the considerable expense associated with applying these fungicides often prohibits preemptive action against the disease since there are currently no reliable decision support systems available to aid producers in determining the probability of disease development in their fields. The proposed program is directed at utilizing advanced site-specific meteorological analysis techniques and the ever-growing stream of weather observations (both in-situ and remotely-sensed) to support a fungicide application decision support system (FADSS). Specifically, funds from this Phase II award will be used to develop a FADSS for control of white mold in dry edible beans, although it will be easily extensible to other susceptible crops upon collection of datasets for those crops. This system will be designed to aid producers in evaluating the risk of white mold development and the potential for receiving a return on a fungicide investment in each field. The FADSS will integrate crop disease, leaf wetness, and soil models, a wide range of in-situ and remotely-sensed weather observations, sophisticated weather analysis and forecast systems, an economical tool for assessment of white mold spore concentrations, and internet and computer telephony technology into a comprehensive FADSS. The system will require only very infrequent interaction with the producer, and will use both the internet and computer telephony to notify producers of impending problems. The automated nature of the FADSS and its application of `push' technology will help it to succeed where others have failed by avoiding the pitfall of being a drain on the producer's time. This approach to minimizing disease losses stands to have a significant positive impact in a much shorter time than efforts to breed disease resistance to the disease.",

Thus, the need for rapid microbiological monitoring of water, air, surfaces, and food for the military has accelerated development offaster diagnostic technologies.  Recent advances in detection methods based on PCR amplification of the genetic material, antigen and antibody pairs, and direct mass spectrometry of biological samples promise more rapid identification of pathogens ofmilitary significance.  To advance the laboratory prototypes toward field-ready prototypes, integration, portability and contamination issues must be addressed. For example, the collection and replication of nucleic acids by PCR requires that the sample becleaned prior to detection.  The goals of this project include development of sophisticated sample preconditioning subsystems for the isolation and pretreatment of DNA samples.  Another substantial goal is the non-trivial fluidic interconnection of anaerosol collector to the sample preconditioning unit, providing a fast and seamless means of collecting bioparticules and preparing a sample for PCR.  Together, the attainment of these goals will create an integrated system allowing the most accurate rapiddetection available.\"",

Management of overgrowth is hampered because low cost and easy to use diagnostic tests do not exist. Detection is meaningful because while the condition is never cured it can be effectively controlled through treatment. Our objective is to develop an easy to use and cost effective test to detect bacterial overgrowth. The clinical utility is the ability to detect the bacteria overgrowth as accurately as the gold standard (jejunal cultures) in patients exhibiting classic disease symptoms but whom ordinarily wouldn't receive expensive and invasive jejunal culture.  The test will accurately detect the condition pre- and post-therapy and lead to quality of life improvement. The novelty of this proposal is the use of a non-invasive breath test employing a naturally occurring sugar labeled with carbon-13 as a probe.  If overgrowth is present, the bacteria is present, the bacteria in the small intestine metabolize the labeled substrate and high concentrations of (13)CO(2) are expired in the breath. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: There are 25 million Americans over the age of 65 and they accounted for 10 million physician office visits with complaints of classic overgrowth symptoms The proposed test will significantly reduce national health care expenditures because proper diagnosis will lead to fewer office visits, more prudent use of drugs and better general health and well-being in the elderly.",

The tool is based on proper reduction of the original 3D flow path topology to an equivalent2D/axisymmetric slice which retains the salient features of the original component. Developing this design tool requires extensive testing against available experiments, established theory and phenomenological arguments in order to identify thegeometric/acoustic parameters that render a 2D section representative of the actual internal flow path. Preliminary results in Phase I were very promising and showed that amplitudes and frequencies of the dominant oscillations in an augmentor werepredicted as functions of temperature, mass flow rate and equivalence ratio. Building on this initial success, the proposed design tool will be developed and tested in Phase II.\"",

The initial implementation of CDM has been aimed at airport Ground Delay Programs (GDPs). However, it has become increasingly evident that very significant delays and throughput degradations have arisen from en-route airspace problems and limitations, particularly from convective weather activity. This effort focused on the application of CDM technology and concepts to the management of en-route traffic (Collaborative Routing). In this phase II effort, we will implement, demonstrate and evaluate a number of different collaborative routing rationing algorithms (CRRAs) to assign use of en route resources to individual flights. We have found that such algorithms are both feasible and can be made consistent with traffic management goals and with the CDM paradigm. The CRRA algorithms will be implemented in NASA?s System-Wide Evaluation Planning Tool (SWEPT) and a major Human-In-The-Loop simulation experiment will be conducted with participants from the FAA Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC), Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs) and Airlines Operation Center (AOC) facilities. This simulation will allow the air transportation community to discuss and refine the CRRA concept toward eventual deployment in the National Airspace System (NAS).",

Thecatalyst used for the state-of-the-art monopropellant hydrazine requires excessively high temperatures to decompose the CINCH fuel, which results in unnecessary operational costs.  In the Phase I SBIR Program, a mechanistic theory to develop lowtemperature reaction pathways for CINCH fuels was developed and successfully demonstrated.  This approach provided simple, qualitative guidelines for the selection of catalysts for the desired reaction.  Consequently, METSS was able to synthesize andevaluate several catalytically reactive systems capable of oxidizing and decomposing the CINCH fuel at a much lower temperature than the current catalyst.  The research data obtained demonstrate that METSS has developed three different classes of catalystsof potential relevance to the proposed application.

Applying thetwo-component sealant is both time consuming and laborintensive.  Furthermore, the excess sealant can be classified ashazardous waste due to chromate content. Under the Phase I SBIRprogram, METSS was able to demonstrates the technical feasibilityof using several different approaches to developing and pre-applying polymeric sealants to fasteners that create a watertightseal and protect the substrate materials from corrosion afterinstallation.  Under the Phase II SBIR program, METSS will morefully develop each of these approaches and evaluate them againsta rigorous testing and evaluation program derived from existingperformance specifications for sealants and fasteners.  Thedevelopment, incorporation and qualification of environmentallyfriendly corrosion inhibitors to impart the necessary corrosionprotection will be emphasized.  The final product will be fullyqualified against performance standards and manufacturer criterianeeded to support system implementation.

        "abstract": "Abstract         65735        There are many sources of coated (metallized and painted plastics) yet recyclable plastics from post-industrial processes that are available in large, pre-sorted quantities.  Furthermore, advances in separation technologies continue to make available more sources of these potentially recyclable materials from post-consumer waste streams.  However, the inability to remove coating materials from plastics in an environmentally friendly and cost effective manner results in the landfill of hundreds of millions of pounds of valuable polymer substrate materials each year.  Accordingly, trillions of Btus of energy are lost that could otherwise be conserved if appropriate techniques were developed for recovery and recycle.  This project will develop processing methodologies to separate coated plastics parts out of existing commercial waste-streams and remove the coatings from the plastic substrate materials in order to support the recovery and recycle of valuable polymer substrate materials.   Phase I demonstrated that an existing demetallization technology could be adapted to the removal of coatings from a variety of high value plastic substrate materials.  Phase II will optimize the process for coatings removal in a variety of automotive and consumer electronic applications.             Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The coatings removal technology should have broad application within the automotive industry where the recovered substrate materials could be used for decorative coatings, structural glazings, under-hood applications, and interior automotive components.  Other applications include the development of specialized compounds based around these recycled materials for use in consumer electronics (cell phone cases, computer housings, etc.).",

Implementation of such technology will drastically reduce the risk of premature hydraulic systemfailures by providing immediate feedback with respect to the condition of the hydraulic fluid.  In addition, DoD agencies have embarked on the development of a new generation of ground support equipment, which will possess an on-board hydraulic fluidpurification unit to ensure clean, contamination free hydraulic fluid is used to service military aircraft.  Under the Phase I program, METSS investigated the technical feasibility of combining a particle-counting device, a non-dispersive IR-based watersensor and a fluorescence-based chlorinated hydrocarbon sensor as components of an affordable, multi-sensor configuration to meet the objectives of this DoD initiative.  Under the proposed Phase II program, METSS will optimize the performance of each ofthe sensor technologies for the intended application and develop and integrate methodologies to support field integration.  Emphasis will be placed on designing and building an integrated sensor system that not only meets the stated performancerequirements, but is also reliable and easy to use and maintain in the field.

For operation in the far infrared (8-12 micron) region of the electromagnetic spectrum, optics must be kept at cryogenic temperature. At present, such devices are not commercially available for laboratory or spaceflight use. The primary objective of this SBIR proposal is to develop and test a tunable etalon that could be used at cryogenic temperatures based on an existing spaceflight qualified piezoelectric motor design. This actuator would also find application in infrared astronomy, both on the ground and on instruments such as the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST). The secondary objective of this effort is to apply this motor to the Multi-Order Etalon Sounder instrument for remote sensing of trace gases in the troposphere. A description of the motor concept as well as the MOES instrument is included in this proposal.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In this Phase II SBIR effort, MicroSound Systems proposes to develop flexible implantable electrode and interconnect structures based on flexible printed wiring technology and Liquid Crystal Polymer dielectric materials.  Implants for biological monitoring and neurological stimulation could potentially benefit millions of people suffering from a wide range of physiological conditions, including impaired hearing or vision, diabetes, and epilepsy.  Additional applications include intracranial pressure and cerebral blood gas monitoring, and patient monitoring, for tracking parameters such as heart rate. This new technology utilizes leading-edge multi-layer flexible printed wiring fabrication techniques, including laser micromachining, thin films, plasma processing, and advanced photolithography techniques.  In the Phase I effort, Liquid Crystal Polymer multi-layer high density interconnect flexible circuits with fine-scale features were fabricated. And MicroSound is now closer to demonstrating that the technology is capable of producing an \"implant ready\" circuit.  In the Phase II effort, MicroSound will continue to aggressively push the development of this technology. Development of a fabrication process for making a prototype electrode array for a cochlear implant will continue, and our efforts will be expanded to include a retinal implant, patient monitoring, and some non-implant medical applications such as ultrasound imaging. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: MicroSound's enabling implant cabling technology is seen as being essential for cochlear and retinal implants and similar devices, which together represent a market exceeding $200 million annually. This technology is also important for implantable and non-implanted patient monitoring products (for tracking pressure, gases, or fluids), and other medical non-implant applications such as ultrasound imaging, for which the total of the aggregate markets is in the billions of dollars.",

The coating is an epoxy-silicate base with additives of silicone and melting point depressants.It is hard, durable, slick, hydrophobic, and ice-phobic. The Phase I effort was completed in October 2001 and established technical feasibility. The Phase I effort showed that the coating: (a) sheds ice in an icing wind tunnel; (b) is durable enough towithstand rain erosion testing; and (c) to the extent that it was tested, is compatible with the B-2.   During Phase II, we continue to refine and test the formulation. Primary objectives are to: increase service life by controlling the rate that meltingpoint depressants are released, conduct a flight test on a B-2, and qualify the coating for B-2 service. Phase II work includes icing wind tunnel testing, static ice adhesion testing, various types of electron microscopy analysis, weathering testing,coating adhesion, compatibility, and durability testing.\"",

Based on encouraging Phase II clinical trials for breast cancer treatment, complete response rates were shown to improve significantly when hyperthermia was added to radiation treatment protocols. This work will draw on the feasibility study conducted during Phase I where we demonstrated the capability of quantitatively monitoring temperatures to within 1 degree Celcius and a spatial resolution of 1 cm. Efforts by the Dartmouth College microwave imaging research group to develop a clinical breast cancer detection system has also established the feasibility of in vivo microwave breast imaging using a water-coupled interface in the clinical environment. The key components of Phase II will include refining the prototype clinical patient interface and integrating it with a scanned focused ultrasound hyperthermia device. A primary objective of Phase II will be to develop a clinical prototype system where data can be collected for image reconstruction at several vertical positions in less than one minute with quantitative difference images being available as treatment feedback information within 2 minutes after collection of each data set. Initial overall performance assessments will be conducted using phantom and ex vivo experimental configurations.",

The analysis modules are general enough to be applicable for the complete program life cycle, from conceptual design to operational analysis. The automation layer handles the translation of high-level systems requirements into module-level design space constraints, and buffers the detailed analysis results. The suite encompasses an archiving function, which enables the time evolution of the design to be explicitly tracked, facilitating the systems designer?s understanding of the design space, and providing a formal means to manage risk.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Promising developments in diesel injection technology have given rise to an increasing acceptance of diesel engines in the passenger vehicle market, especially in Europe. As with heavy-duty vehicles, more stringent emission levels are achieved via control of the diesel combustion process through precise timing and metering of the injected fuel quantities. In particular, European manufacturers such as Siemens and Bosch are competing to bring the benefits of piezoelectric injection technology to the market (e.g., Pugeot in 2002). Their actuation mechanisms are state-of-the-art, but their techniques are typically \"on-off\" in nature, and although their engine control techniques work well, they rely on engine maps that enforce injection timing and quantity as a function of engine parameters, and they do not adequately handle transients and modifications due to age and wear. In contrast, Mid Technology Corporation's proposed injection technique will provide proportional control over the injection process, and thus more degrees of freedom to control the problem. This new approach also closes an adaptation control loop in real time. Because of the associated injection and combustion modeling that govern controller operation, it is anticipated that this algorithm will converge faster than existing technologies, providing the ability to more effectively deal with transients. Phase I focused on generating a simplified combustion control model to predict and minimize the formation of NOx as a function of injection profile. These efforts were very successful in identifying an optimized shape and indicated that fine control of injection profile can have a marked effect on output emissions. The primary Phase II objective is to experimentally verify these analytical results. Working closely with an injector design sponsor, Mid Technology Corporation will develop the actuation, control, and power components needed to realize the effect of injected trajectory on emissions. Additional Phase II objectives are to improve combustion modeling and predict an optimum injection shape for minimum NOx, hydrocarbons, and particulate matter. By succeeding in an experimental environment, Mid Technology Corporation will be capable of commercializing this technology and marketing it to engine manufacturers as a critical method of satisfying environmental regulatory constraints. Furthermore, the development of breakthrough actuation and control technologies can be used to help realize innovative combustion control concepts, such as the Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition technology. Finally, the introduction of NO suppressants through separate but precisely timed injection mechanisms can be achieved by the proposed valve technology. For example, a four-way proportional valve allows relative control of a diesel packet followed by a suppressant packet.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Solar physics and astrophysics require very accurate spatial and spectral resolution of celestial x-ray and gamma ray sources. Fabricating x-ray, gamma-ray, and neutron collimators that have the precision necessary to achieve arcsecond or sub-arcsecond imaging is a critical problem. Lenses or mirrors cannot be fabricated due to the lack of efficient reflectors or refractors for these wavelengths. Collimators are required to achieve the necessary resolution. In order to achieve high-resolution images, fine collimator geometries are needed. Commercial collimator fabrication techniques provide structures with coarse cell sizes that require long structural lengths to achieve image optimization. Collimators with fine cell geometries help reduce the overall length of the collimating structure and increase resolution. Single collimators have been fabricated, with fine cell sizes, using photochemical machining and stack lamination. However, assembling a multi-grid array from single collimators requires demanding assembly and alignment schemes. P-10 Micro Engineering's proposed innovation is to develop a manufacturing technique for fabricating multi-grid, high-resolution, rotating modulation collimators for arcsecond or sub-arcsecond x-ray and gamma-ray imaging.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This project addresses the development of high performance evaporators for loop heat pipes (LHP) or capillary pumped loops. Thermal management of future high-power laser instrumentation will require power dissipation of 2-5 kW at heat fluxes beyond 100 W/cm2. Although localized heat fluxes as high as 100 W/cm2 have been demonstrated using bi-disperse wicks, the maximum average heat flux capability of present LHP evaporators is an order of magnitude lower. Cooling high heat flux loads with present technology would necessitate the use heat spreaders, which would substantially increase the thermal resistance and weight of the system. We propose an evaporator configuration that can operate at average heat fluxes an order of magnitude larger, and thermal resistances an order of magnitude lower than present LHP evaporators. A novel fabrication approach enables vapor/liquid distribution networks to maximize capillary pumping and substantially reduce liquid and vapor flow pressure drops. Phase I proof-of-concept tests and scoping analyses demonstrated the feasibility and performance potential of the proposed evaporator. In Phase II we will develop the evaporator technology through a combination of modeling, fabrication trials, and separate effects tests. We will then demonstrate the technology by designing, fabricating, and testing a prototype LHP incorporating the proposed evaporator.",

A common package is necessary to reduce the overall size, provide a common environment and further reduce cost.  To realize a successfulintegrated IMU, the approach is to use gyros and accelerometers that are based on a common design and are subject to common fabrication process constraints.  Commonality simplifies the design, improves yield and enables a greater understanding of operationand compensation.

Mirum proposes a multi-faceted, multi-dimensional battery of measurement strategies andtechniques to significantly enhance, expand, and validate data collection and data analysis of pertinent interest and valuable utility to the Army.  Among the techniques we propose are:  archival measures;  problem solving and decision making exercisesunder various constraints and stressors;  neuropsychological and physiological measures; and various techniques for measuring situational knowledge, environmental scanning, situational awareness, situational assessment, options recognition, judgement, anddecision making processes.  Our goals for Phase II are to deliver to the Army a \"toolbox\" of assessment strategies and assessment tools and data collection instruments that will provide objective and well supported subjective measurements.  The range ofapplication of one or more tools will span from individual interaction through web based assessment services to classroom and simulation environments, to field environments.  Our tool set will provide the Army with a highly innovative, comprehensive,validating means of measuring and assessing leadership development which we think will constitute a next generations system for these tasks.  We believe the results will be much greater objectivity, range, repeatability, consistency, diagnostics, andpredictability of outcomes.

These condensed DNA particles carry one or more virus-like characteristics that make them more efficient at (a) certain step(s) of delivery, yet maintaining advantages over real viruses. The first goal of these studies is to lay the foundation for the construction of a novel family of such virus-like particles. We plan to use a variety of synthetic and traditional polymers and a variety of chemical approaches to form condensed and covalently cross-linked (caged) DNA particles with positive, negative and near-neutral surface potentials. Then the emphasis will be shifted to enhancing DNA nuclear transport, which is one of the most invincible obstacles to successful gene delivery. The efficiency of these particles in DNA nuclear delivery will be tested without or with covalently attached nuclear targeting signals, in microinjected cells. Based on the sub-cellular localization of labeled DNA and on the quantitation of marker gene expression (minimum 10-20x increase over control) the most efficient particle formulation technology(ies) will be selected. The particles then can be adjusted to the needs of many different delivery systems.",

Ground-to-ground and ground-to-air global communicationschannels traverse the ionosphere and are affected by ionospheric conditions.  Having an accurate and easily assessable method to determine the conditions of the ionosphere is a particularly important requirement in the region between 45 degrees north andsouth, the most populous region of Earth.  In phase I of this project, we successfully proved the concept of a Rapid Regional Ionosphere Profiling System (R-RIPS).  In this phase II effort, we propose to extend this capability to develop the RapidIonospheric Profiling System for Equatorial and Mid-Latitude (RIPS-EM).  Current proven and validated first principles physical models of the ionosphere are too cumbersome and slow to be run in an operational sense to meet the requirement.  However, HighDimensional Model Representation (HDMR) techniques innovatively and accurately map the input-output relationships of these models with orders-of-magnitude improvement in computational speed.  These techniques were used in Phase I of this effort to create aprototype Fully Equivalent Operational Model (FEOM) which mapped the input-output relationships of the ionospheric component of the Integrated Space Weather Prediction Model (ISM), a global thre",

This technology would be a direct extension of the concept investigated during Phase I.This approach appears very promising and, as a result, DARPA has agreed to fund an additional $250K to supplement this proposed program.  This particular technology offers a relatively simple radiator candidate to achieve ultra wideband array requirementsas compared to other conventional approaches.  One very important feature of this element is that a broad banded balun is not required.  Additionally, the elements are inherently circularly polarized, and therefore do not require a broadband hybrid.Lastly, no absorptive backing is needed to mitigate unwanted ground plane effects.  Physically, all of these features can be provided in a low profile, lightweight, conformal package.  During Phase II, MRC will continue to improve the bandwidth of thiselement by optimizing a number of different design parameters.  The additional funds provided by DARPA will allow MRC to develop and to demonstrate a dual polarized array.  Ultimately, MRC will design, fabricate, and test an array of single and dualpolarized elements.  Program deliverables include an array simulator and demonstration array of each.\"",

Under the Phase I award, Mission Research Corporation has developed a technique to improve the resolution of hyperspectral imagery using co-registered broadband imagery.  We have demonstrated 400% resolution improvement on real-worlddata during Phase I.

However, many challenges exist when wideband phasedarray radar systems are used for MTI.  Larger bandwidth causes more dispersions both in angle and Doppler.  The angle dispersion across the array reduces the number of wideband jammers that can be suppressed by the array, unless a tapped delay line type ofapproach is used with space-time adaptive processing algorithms for jamming suppression.  Yet the tapped delay line approach significantly increases the amount of computations and the need for a large amount of target-free secondary data.  To avoid theseproblems, subbanding approaches become an attractive alternative since they avoid angle and Doppler dispersion problems, as well as the need for a large amount of target-free secondary data, require fewer computations and hence the power consumption, andare readily suitable for parallel processing.  Our approach for addressing these key problems is based on 1) developing optimal statistical processing-based subbanding algorithms for performing both the moving target detection problem and the targetparameter estimation problem (velocity and direction of arrival), 2) developing an RF systems testbed environment for generating realistic radar signature data to test the algorithms, and 3) r",

However, the availability of expert neonatal EEG is very limited, available only at a relatively few specialized pediatric centers in the country. In addition, long-term monitoring of the EEG, which can provide the most accurate prognosis in neonates, is rarely used in clinical practice now because of the considerable effort required reviewing long-term data. This Phase II project will continue the development of accurate and reliable signal processing methods specific for analyzing and characterizing the background EEG in neonates. The objective is to develop an automated classifier of the background neonatal EEG that will agree with assessments made by clinical experts. The eventual goal is the development of a low-cost, easy-to-use monitor that can provide long-term continuous assessments of the neonatal background EEG. Such a monitor could be a good measure of treatment success, indicating neurological improvement or decline after treatment has been given. Also, it could impact level of care decisions, especially for those neonates given poor prognoses (e.g.: severe neurological deficits, or death).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Phase II project is to continue development of a novel molecular imaging reporter construct that can report induction of apoptosis in intact cells and animals. Under normal biological conditions a tight balance between proliferation and cell death (apoptosis) is essential. An imbalance in these two opposing processes has been implicated in a variety of diseases which includes neurdegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's disease), myelodysplastic syndromes, AIDS, ischemic injury, autoimmune disease and cancer. The ability to quantitatively detect (image) apoptosis is a significant advancement for its use in high-throughput screening and validation of novel therapeutic molecules for the above diseases. During the Phase I award period, we have developed and validated a novel molecular reporter cassette which when transfected into mammalian cells results in a polypeptide that has significantly attenuated levels of reporter activity. If the cefl undergoes apoptosis, a caspase (a protease activated during apoptosis) specific cleavage of the reporter protein occurs which activates the reporter enabling detectionhmaging of the apoptotic event. In this Phase II proposal, we will test the specifity of this approach to image three different proteases involved in apoptosis (Caspase-3, -8 and -9). Three different reporter molecules, each containing a different cleavage site specific for one of three Caspases will be constituatively expressed in D54 human glioma cells with either luciferase (for bioluminescence detection) or green fluorescent protein (for fluorescence detection) as the activatable reporter (Specific Aim 1). These cell lines will be used to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of these reporter molecules to \"report\" on specific Caspases activated during different anticancer therapies. Moreover, in Specific Aim 2 transgenic mice will be developed using these reporter molecules wherein the activation of apoptosis within the skin in response to UV radiation can be imaged. Overall, this reporter molecule will provide a unique opportunity to image specific apoptotic events non-invasively and in real time in intact cell and animals. This feature will provide exciting and important opportunities for both the pharmaceutical industry and scientists to study apoptosis using in vitro high throughput screening compounds with pro- and anti- apoptotic activity as well as for target validation in vivo in intact animals.",

Therefore, functions must be assigned to the sequenced genes, which is the goal of functional genomics. Computational approaches can accelerate dramatically such annotation efforts by producing predictive functions that then can be rapidly confirmed.  This project will build a genomics annotation platform (GAP) that applies state-of-the-art computer-based comparative genomics and structural genomics technologies in order to extract predictive gene function and protein-protein interaction from sequence and structure databases.  Phase I developed all of the computational tools essential to the functionality of the system, and GAP can already be used to reproduce published comparative genomics and structural genomics annotations or to assign putative function to unknown genes.  Phase II will have three main objectives: (1) optimize existing tools and benchmark them against working test-sets; (2) integrate the already implemented annotation strategies into a seamless research environment and develop an efficient graphical user interface; and (3) set up a system for automatic updates to GAP following the growth of genomic databases, and package the system into a commercial software product.       Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The GAP should be a powerful, stand-alone, computational genomics product that can be deployed in-house by licensees, and maintained and updated for a service fee.",

This SBIRPhase II effort includes (1) fault-tolerant implementation of theIEEE 1451.2 Standard, (2) implementation of sensor networkingtechnology using COTS-based technology, (3) implementation of thephysics-based fault tolerance approach for a network of smartsensors, and (4) implementation of a hierarchical approachcorresponding to the hierarchical abstraction of a physicalsystem of interest (i.e., an entire ship). In addition,technology for interfacing the proposed software products withproducts that are already in use in naval vessels will bedeveloped as part of this effort. Demonstration of the fault-tolerant technology to be developed with suitable sensornetworks, and further refinement of the technology based onfeedback will occur in stages during the Phase II effort and willcontinue, with full demonstrations, through the Phase II Option.BENEFITS: Continuous modernization of Naval ships as well as decreasing reliance on on-board military personnel calls for the",

The properties of biofilms can be exploited to improve the detection of these agents. Biofilms consist of microorganisms growing on asurface and enmeshed in a polymer matrix. Observation of biofilms in a variety of environments indicate they have a natural ability to capture a wide range of organic and inorganic substances from their surroundings. This property allows biofilms toconcentrate trace quantities of hazardous substances, which can be used to improve techniques for the detection of chemical or biological warfare agents in the environment. Additionally, retention of these captured substances by biofilms may allow users toattribute a contamination event to its source. Improved methods for the detection and removal of toxic contaminants from the environment will increase the safety of military personnel and civilian populations.\"",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Biofilm barriers are a promising new technology for the containment and remediation of groundwater contaminated with nitrate and other pollutants. These barriers are formed by subsurface injection of bacteria and/or nutrient solutions to stimulate the growth of bacteria that produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and also may degrade contaminants. The engineered accumulation of biomass and EPS in the subsurface is used to control groundwater flow and enhance treatment strategies. For example, a biofilm barrier can be used as a \"funnel\" to channel contaminated groundwater to a treatment zone. Unlike many other barrier technologies, biofilm barriers cause minimal surface disturbance and have no obvious depth limitation. MSE Technology Applications, Inc., along with collaborators at the Center for Biofilm Engineering, Montana State University, has successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of biofilm barriers in systems ranging from small laboratory models to a large-scale test cell. This test cell contained a 180-foot long by 20-foot deep biofilm barrier that was used as part of Phase I SBIR research to show complete denitrification of a nitrate plume. The next logical step in the development of this technology is field-scale research. The primary objectives of this research are to evaluate, under actual field conditions, the ability to control groundwater flow using a biofilm barrier system and to determine the effectiveness of the biofilm barrier to remove nitrate from groundwater. Following successful completion of this field demonstration, MSE will market the technology for the cleanup of nitrate-contaminated groundwater.",

Validation studies show the predictive capability of the MCASE            system is about 85 percent. That is, 85 percent concordance is expected between      experiment and computational genotoxicity predictions for new chemicals. The         strong correlation between chemical structure and genotoxicity is particularly       useful for 'in silico' prescreening of new drugs in the pharmaceutical               industry.

Collaboration will be sought with large drug companies, with mutual exchange of      data. Thus the databases will evolve and improve over time as new data are           submitted to form a centralized pool of mutagenicity data, that will provide a       resource for avoiding unneeded testing of chemicals structurally similarly to        those that are already thoroughly understood.

        "abstract": "Abstract         65339          The DOE uses a variety of stand-alone computer programs to analyze and identify seismic events for the monitoring of a nuclear test-ban.  However, these separate programs do not communicate adequately with one another so that they can exchange data easily, and newly developed analysis programs cannot communicate with them directly.  A new software architecture is needed to facilitate data flow among these legacy and new codes so that the results of one program can be sent to another and so that the programs can make function calls to one another. This project will develop two data communications protocols to permit data to be exchanged directly among seismic analysis codes and allow one program to make calls to another.  In Phase I, an interactive graphics program for seismogram data display and measurement was modified by adding an interface that allows data communications that are compliant with Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA).  A Java-language program for platform-independent interactive graphics display and for certain analysis operations on seismograms was similarly adapted with a CORBA interface.  Now, the two programs can exchange data within a single computer or across a network.  In Phase II, the CORBA interface will be further modified to transmit data segments for specialized processing by seismic analysis programs.  Corresponding CORBA interfaces will be added to those codes, and an overall integration architecture will be deployed.  A parallel effort will be directed at using Web services protocols to allow these codes to communicate across an intranet.            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A flexible architecture for integrating research tools for seismic reference events analysis should be applicable to the mission of the U.S. Air Force Technical Applications Center, the International Data Center of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, and the National Data Centers of treaty signatories.  Commercial customers include business-to-business data exchange among, for example, earthquake engineering and insurance companies and the oil and gas exploration industry.",

MMS will develop an automated WEB-based delivery, tracking and           reporting system to deliver CME credit training via the Internet. Primary care       physicians (gatekeepers) need cancer control training to reduce cancer               mortality/morbidity. Currently, this type of training is not easily                  accessible.                                                                                                                                                               In Phase I, MMS will design/produce one pilot module that will undergo               targeted assessment by a select group of nationally recognized CME experts. It       will then be reviewed by a focus group of primary care physicians.  Formative        research will provide clear guidance to develop the design criteria and model        for completing the remaining 9 modules. An Expert Review Panel will oversee          the development.                                                                                                                                                          During Phase II, the 9 remaining CME modules will be developed under this            grant. Two additional modules will be developed through alternative funding.         The completed courseware, consisting of 12 cancer-specific CME modules, will         undergo a statistically valid field evaluation. The completed courseware will        reside on an innovative WEB-site utilizing proprietary compression technology        to permit full-motion video, high quality graphics and audio.                        PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Based on the 15 year experience of the Texas Medical Association (TMA) in providing CME  to Texas primary care physicians, demand for this courseware will be high.  TMA will  provide this training to Texas physicians through their WEB site and MMS will market it to  the rest of the country and would through a commercial WEB site.  Also MMS will license  the course to other medical associations, health organizations and commercial outlets.  Profits will be shared among TMA, MMS and BearSoft.  The 4-year revenue projections  exceed 10 million dollars.  If only 1/3 of sales projections are met, this would still be an  outstanding small business success.",

Although the last ten years have seen dramatic improvements in therapeutic approaches to HF, the expanding number of patients with chronic HF and its persistently poor prognosis make it clear that additional novel treatment approaches are necessary. Recent research has identified myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) as a potentially important mediator of cardiac hypertrophy and subsequent myocardial failure. Myogen will develop high throughput screening assays and will screen for compounds that inhibit MEF2 signaling.  In Phase I, Myogen demonstrated feasibility of the project by developing highly reproducible and robust HI assays for the MEF2/HDAC interaction.  In Phase II Myogen will apply selected assays from Phase I for screening drug-like, small molecule compound libraries to identify inhibitors of MEF2 dependent gene activation.    In Phase Ill Myogen will pursue validation experiments of identified inhibitors of MEF2 signaling, evaluating their ability to block the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure in a variety of in vitro and animal models. Following validation, Myogen will pursue commercialization by advancing drug candidates into lead optimization and human clinical testing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"Global Positioning System (GPS) applications which involve safety-of-flight operations (e.g. precision and non-precision approach) require integrity monitoring.  Previous integrity monitoring techniques implemented took advantage of redundant observations(e.g. Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring or RAIM) or off board resources such as wide area or local area augmentation.  Recent advances have led to the development of ultra-tightly coupled (UTC) GPS/inertial solutions that provide significantlyimproved performance in the presence of signal interference.  In this proposal, a UTC GPS/inertial receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (GI-RAIM) solution is proposed that enables robust detection, identification and rejection of faulty GPS satellites.Under the Phase II effort, it is proposed to build a GPS/inertial test-bed for evaluation and validation of the GI-RAIM algorithm.  The performance will be demonstrated using data collected from the test-bed using a combination of analysis, simulation andlive satellite testing.  To support GPS/inertial integrity testing at AFRL, an inertial simulator will also be delivered.  The Phase II project will result in an UTC GPS/Inertial integrated system that can be demonstrated to meet the RTCA integrityrequirements for en-route, and non-precision approach with a goal of also enabling SCAT-1 precision approach and landing capability, all without reliance on the WAAS civil augmentation system.\"",

Synthesis of gold and silver nanoparticle colloids for commercial use in the health care industry will be pursued as part of the proposed effort; the SMAD synthesis method will be optimized for commercial-scale manufacturing of gold and silver colloids. This approach yields high purity colloids, free of unwanted byproducts and ready for further processing without the cumbersome purification steps characteristic of other synthesis methods. This innovation significantly simplifies the manufacturing process of colloidal products and reduces production cost. The proprietary digestive-ripening step will be scaled up and developed to achieve monodispersion and particle size control of the metal nanoparticles contained in the colloids. Methods for transferring solvent-based colloids into an aqueous environment will be developed. Synthesis steps involved in the manufacturing of colloidal gold and silver will be integrated in a semi-continuous or continuous process. The commercial potential of this project will be for immunological labeling and DNA detection using the colloidal gold solutions. The project offers an alternative-manufacturing route that significantly lowers the cost. Silver-based colloids have potential applications in burn wound treatment or as effective disinfectants and anti-inflammatory agents. The development of SMAD technology will enable high-volume manufacturing of many nanoparticle materials whose availability is currently limited by production inefficiencies. These nanomaterials will support future technologies in industry and find application in both commercial and academic research, as highly reactive catalytic materials, magnetic information storage media, ferrofluids, and magnetic tracers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nanosphere, Inc. is utilizing gold nanoparticle probes to develop a novel chip-based DNA detection technology that does not require target amplification. Because of their ultra-high sensitivity, exquisite specificity, low cost and remarkable stability, the gold nanoparticle probes could define a new industry standard for nucleic acid testing. The current proposal describes two objectives that will significantly broaden our SNP detection capability. First, we will continue developing a rapid test to identify simultaneously SNPs in three genes involved in hypercoagulation disorders [factor V (1691 G->A), prothrombrin (20210 G->A) and MTHFR (677 C->T)]. Phase I feasibility studies have demonstrated key capabilities of the system including detection and SNP discrimination in un-amplified genomic DNA. In Phase II, the individual genes will be integrated into a single test. The system requirements will be optimized and internally validated. In the second objective, strategies to further improve sensitivity and specificity will be evaluated with the goal of increasing our multiplex capability in PCR-less detection. Success in meeting these goals will provide clinical laboratories with a simple test to assess genetic risk factors in hypercoagulation. Further, it will provide the necessary framework for future development of SNP detection tests in genomic DNA for other medically relevant genes.",

In phase I, it was demonstrated that the highly selective gold nanoparticle probes could be used for rapid and reliable SNP genotyping of PCR-amplified APC gene sequences containing the I1307K mutation. The colorimetric change generated by the probes when bound to DNA target was recorded by spotting onto a membrane and visualized using a simple flatbed scanner or the naked eye. In phase II, Nanosphere seeks to extend this new assay to large scale analysis of SNP's. This will be accomplished by developing a new spotting methodology and simple colorimetric reader/software package that enables multiple PCR samples to be spotted rapidly and analyzed for the presence of specific DNA sequences with minimal user intervention. These developments will then be used to rapidly extend the assay to other SNP's and mutations (e.g. insertions and deletions) related to colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and cardiovascular disease. The development of this technology will ultimately fill the void of a cost effective and reliable SNP detection platform that is both rapid and simple.",

However, these applications will not become feasible until the material is produced in kilogram per day quantities.  Compounding the problem isthe material's high cost, presently $500/g.  Apart from the simple supply and demand economics, the cost is driven by three factors:  expensive capital equipment, low process yields and laborious purification procedures.In the Phase I effort, NanoLab developed and demonstrated a semi-continuous process that results in multi gram per hour yields of high quality multiwall carbon nanotubes, overcoming the two major hurdles to large scale commercialization of carbonnanotubes: yield and purity.The main Phase II goal will be to develop a fully continuous process, that will produce large quantities of high quality carbon nanotubes: multiwall, single-wall, powders, and arrays. Based on our effort thus far, we expect to achieve yield of more than 5kilogram per day, at less than $2 per gram pricing by 2004, for multiwall nanotubes. In addition, we will improve the control over the application driven variants of nanotube morphologies, through experimenting and theoretical and numerical processmodeling. We will develop the market for nanotubes and their applications.\"",

The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Dahlgren Division (NSWC-DD) is currently exploring ways to use nanocrystalline aluminum and tungsten oxides aspotential combination of solid propellant and warhead materials in an aluminothermic reaction.  However, the availability of nanocrystalline tungsten oxides is very limited, if at all commercially available.

However, at high frequency, the power loss increases due to its low electrical resistivity. During the Phase I research, Nanomat, Inc. has successfully synthesized Fe-Co alloy nanoparticles coated with some electrically insulating materials in order to increase its electrical resistivity. Interesting results pertaining to the electrical and magnetic properties of such nanocomposites achieved in the Phase I research suggest that there is considerable merit for further research and development of the approach. In the Phase II program, Nanomat will focus on the optimization of powder synthesis, consolidation and scale-up. We will consolidate the powder in order to achieve high density compacts and evaluate their microstructure, electrical and magnetic properties as a function of compaction parameter. The additional developments and improvements will be the critical steps needed to incorporate the technology developed during Phase I into the market. Additionally, similar studies on synthesis, compaction and characterization of structural, magnetic and electrical properties of Fe-Ni alloy nanoparticles, will also be taken up.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose the application of sublimation purification technology (SPT) to the recovery of water from solid wastes which originate from functions of the spacecraft life support system. We will apply SPT to the purification of simulated solid waste media (SWM)which has a well characterized composition and morphology. SPT is a physical process and does not involve the consumption of any resources except energy. SPT recovers the maximum amount of water because it reduces the wastes to a solid dry material as opposed to a concentrated solution. The recovered water is of high purity. The solid residues should have many desirable properties including very low moisture content, very low yield strength, and high surface area. Since solid residues will be low in moisture, incineration of the solid residue can be achieved using a minimum energy input. In the proposed work SPT performance data will obtained from SWM as a function of varying processing conditions. We will examine the feasibility of applying SPT to the space flight environment and investigate how SPT will be integrated into existing and planned space flight specific life support subsystem components.",

Several areas of application, many of them of particular importance to the US Army, such as penetrators, shaped charges, transparent armors, radar domes, EM and sensor windows, and ballistic protection shields, will benefit immensely from aneconomical and large volume near net shape processing technology.In Phase I, working with our collaborators at PennState University, we demonstrated for the first time that high sintered densities and a fine grain size are obtained in a microwave furnace by using ultrafine grained powders with tailored morphologies asstarting material. The fine grained structure is advantageous in many cases, e.g. shaped charge liners. Our innovative approach is especially suited for materials which are otherwise difficult-to-consolidate, such as phase pure tungsten and aluminumoxynitride.Capitalizing on the recent progress in scaling of the microwave sintering process to large volume, combined with the ability to sinter nanocrystalline metal powders to near theoretical density, we propose (i) to scale the microwave furnace to allowsintering of large volume components with specific geometries, and (ii) to use our nanocrystalline powder-microwave sinteri",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of the proposed program is to develop high capacity nanostructured LixMnO2 cathode materials with a layered structure, which is stable over a wide range of lithiation. Layered LixMnO2 is a very attractive cathode material for aerospace applications because of its high theoretical capacity ( 300 Ah/kg), low cost and low toxicity. In the proposed approach, doped MnO2 nanoparticles will be produced by our patented vapor phase process. MnO2 sheets will be stabilized by an electrochemically active cation, which will restrict the movement of Mn ions. The unique feature of our vapor phase process is its ability to produce kinetically stabilized nanoparticles, which lead to exceptional energy densities, e.g. 900 Wh/kg in case of our V2O5 nanoparticles. In Phase I, electrochemical properties of cathodes fabricated using doped-MnO2 nanoparticles will be evaluated by working with our industrial partner. These materials will lead to Li-polymer batteries with high energy densities (> 250 Wh/kg) and a long cycle life (> 250). In Phase II, prototype batteries will be fabricated and tested for performance, along with optimization and scaling of the powder synthesis process. In Phase III, the newly developed materials will be implemented in commercial batteries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Molecular beacons are hairpin loops of DNA, conjugated to a fluorescent label at one end and a quencher at the other. Upon binding to a complementary target, the beacon opens, the fluorophore and quencher move apart, and fluorescence appears. Sensitivity is dependent upon the \"signal-to-noise ratio\" of fluorescence intensities in the open and closed conformations. Conventional dabcyl-quenched beacons give intensity ratios up to 100. However, the 1.4 nM Nanogold cluster yields intensity ratios up to several thousand, and since it absorbs over a wide range of wavelengths, can quench a variety of fluorophores. Improved gold nanoparticle quenchers will be prepared, using larger gold particles to achieve more effective quenching through surface plasmon coupling. Fluorescence quenching properties of these labels will be made reproducible through the synthesis of modified ligands which increase the solubility, stability and biological compatibility of he beacon, while introducing specific affinities for fluorophores to hold the gold particle and quencher closer together and increase quenching in the closed configuration. Purification methods will be developed and gold quenched DNA and PNA beacons will be compared with conventional analogs for rapid bacterial characterization. Prototype reusable biosensors will be fabricated by immobilizing gold-quenched beacons on fiber optic cables.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this research is to develop a very low cost, in vitro, arterial blood gas (ABG) sensor and associated handheld readout system. ABG measurements are the most frequently ordered tests in intensive care units. The results of Phase I demonstrated excellent accuracy and reproducibility of the optical-based measurements. In addition, optical methods were developed to perform calibration and temperature correction to the data. The multi-analyte sensor was composed of optodes (optical electrodes), one for each analyze of interest, one for calibration and two for temperature sensing. Most importantly, the new, all-plastic biosensor is designed so that it can be mass produced at high speed and low cost. Existing handheld, point of care ABG sensors have not been able to benefit from the very low costs results from totally automated production. As a result, these sensors have had limited success in displacing the service provided by satellite and central laboratories. The new, all-plastic optical sensor is expected to dramatically increase the role of handheld, point of care patient monitoring. The result will be better health care for the patient at lower cost to the hospital. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The annual market for ABG measurements in the US is in excess of $1B and is at least as much again in the rest of the world. The majority of this market is served by central laboratories. The superior health care provided by existing handheld ABG analyzers do not provide significantly reduced costs. The proposed technology for mass production of low-cost sensors will permit the first serious assault on the hegemony of the central laboratory and provide better health care at lower cost.",

In particular, the production of nanowire photocathodes will be optimized, and the physical mechanisms that control their performance will be identified.  In Phase I, gold nanowire photocathodes were successfully engineered and shown to have greater efficiency and extended spectral response compared to traditional planar gold photocathodes.

Phase II will improve the techniques developed in Phase I for the production of nanowire photocathodes and engineer nanowire photocathodes from other materials.  Theoretical work will be performed in order to understand the mechanisms controlling photoemission from nanowires.  Other techniques for the production of nanowires will be explored, and more extensive tests and measurements will be performed to characterize the nanowire photocathodes.

The band gap of AlxGa1-xN has a long wavelength cutoff that can be varied from 365 to 200 nm as the AlN molar fraction increases from zero to one. Further, this compound can show a negative electron affinity (NEA) and can be used in high temperature and high power applications. The phase I effort will employ molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow ordered thin-film AlxGa1-xN photocathodes on (0001) sapphire substrates. Surface analysis will be performed at different steps of the growth process to determine what conditions promote the development of the NEA surface. In Phase II, the photocathode will be coupled to micromachined silicon microchannel plate (MCP) and miniature photomultiplier tube (MPMT) technologies to produce high gain (>1,000) detectors that operate at low power, high speed, and over a large dynamic range. Sensitive in the short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV), l < 290 nm, region of the spectrum, these detectors respond to relevant emission bands for UV astronomy, atmospheric ozone monitoring, and the remote sensing of earth resources.",

This reaction occurs with a minimal heat ofpolymerization in an oxygen-containing aqueous environment at physiological pH. The free-radical cure reaction is easily triggered by applying a filtered and focused light beam of known power via optical fiber from a source with a broad wavelength range tothe synthetic solder (polymer/initiator) formulation. During Phase II, we would work with a biomedical institute partner and investor to further develop the tissue solder system by maximizing adhesion, minimizing cure/illumination time, and maximize watertransfer in the resulting system.

Extensive plastic tubing is used to circulate water for body heat removal. The undergarment is quite binding and restrictive and inefficient in the removal of body heat to the external heat exchanger. The proposed innovation is the creation of a new thermally conductive textile fiber using nanocomposite engineering. The immediate opportunity is reduced contact surface required for the plastic tubing. The loops can be spaced further apart greatly enhancing comfort and mobility. Improved rate of heat transfer and more uniform temperature distribution will provide the benefit of reduced water circulation needs, leading to an opportunity for reduction in the weight and bulk of the space suit and improved astronaut mobility. Reduced support systems, lower launch weight, greater personal comfort and extended activity time are expected.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and commercialize a new technology for mass producing nanometer-sized ceramic powders at dramatically reduced costs. The technology, Combined Atomization and Reaction Technique (CART), involves providing an atomizing gas medium containing a reactant element such as hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, chlorine, fluorine, boron, or sulfur; preparing a metal alloy melt super-heated to a spontaneous reaction temperature at which the alloy can undergo a self-sustaining reaction with the selected reactant element; and introducing reactant gas to concurrently mix, atomize, and react with the critically super-heated alloy melt to form ultra-fine ceramic particles in an atomizer chamber. This Phase II project will design and build a prototype pilot-scale CART apparatus to demonstrate the commercial viability of the technology as applied to the synthesis of nano-sized oxides of selected metals that are deemed to have the greatest commercial potential. The commercial potential of ultrafine powders are in the production of catalysts, coatings and films, conductive pastes, cosmetics, electromagnetic components, electronic devices, fire retardant materials, magnetic fluids, sintered and injection-molded parts, ceramic composites, magnetic storage media, phosphors, pigments, polishing media, and toners. Indium-tin oxide (ITO) powders are used to prepare sputtering targets for deposition of transparent films for use in flat-panel display technology. Nano-grained materials can be employed to replace various load-bearing and non-structural parts in automobiles, infrastructures, off-shore structures, piping, containers, electronic equipment housings, etc. Nano-grained cermets and ceramics are outstanding cutting tool materials. Transparent nano-grained ceramics can be utilized in a broad array of applications, including transparent ceramic appliance components, clear \"glassware\" and artistic artifacts. Transparent ceramics may also be used in ballistic protection armor by law enforcement, security police and armored car personnel.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The primary objective of this USDA SBIR Phase II research grant is to develop and support successful Indian entrepreneurs while developing new supply sources for raw material and new product development for the company. This research grant will demonstrate how a private marketing and agricultural based company can contribute to increasing private entrepreneurship among tribal farmers using innovative agricultural, cooperative, educational, and economic development technologies to create new economies, and sources of revenue to rural Native American reservations and communities. The resulting farming organization will integrate raw material production and 1st stage processing from Tribal member farmers organized into a farming cooperative model known as New Generation Cooperatives (NGC). In order to achieve the overall objective, five technical objectives will be accomplished in planned sequence so that the results will witness a replicable business entity, ready to start business. Objective # 1 will involve organizing and assisting the Cherokee Farmer Steering Council (SC) in research and development of an agricultural cooperative business plan in order to develop capacity for participation in the Natural Products industry as suppliers of traditional value-added herbal products. Objective # 2 will include the organization and development of an innovative herbal farming collaboration based on the existing model known as New Generation Cooperatives (NGC). The New Generation cooperative is an new innovation that has proven successful for small farmers to compete by pooling resources, combining investment equity, effectively using market information, and moving their products past the farm gate closer to the end consumer by adding value to the products through 1st and 2nd level processing. This will be the major and most resource-consuming objective. Objective # 3 will include the implementation and refinement of a new training and preparation curriculum for the Cherokee Nation's existing Individual Development Account (IDA) Small Business Program with components that include agricultural cooperatives and new horticultural technologies. The IDA program holds much promise in developing necessary skills, business and finance literacy, asset saving, and related education for new entrepreneurs preparing to launch or participate in small businesses and the NGC. Objective # 4 will involve the implementing the Cherokee Farmers' NGC business plan. This objective will take place in the second year after completion of the Cherokee Farmer Cooperative's Business Plan. Objective # 5 will conclude the research of this Phase II grant where the PI and consultants will have assisted the Cherokee farmers in research and development of value-added herbal infusion (tea) processing capacity enabling the cooperative to begin farming and plan for processing a line of distinct product offerings in the form of herbal infusions and teas.",

Recent efforts have focused on the development of PET-based radiotracers for use in studies of the dopamine transporter (DAT) abundance and pharmacology Changes in the density and function of DAT have been implicated in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases such as Parkinson?s disease, major depression, Huntington's chorea, schizophrenia, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). Our earlier studies have focused on fluorine-18 labeled tropane derivatives, such as FP-C1T, in which the N-methyl group of the tropane was replaced by a [S18FJ fluoropropyl group. During the Phase I project, we characterized the cerebral monoamine transporter binding affinity of a series of novel fluoralkyl-containing tropane derivatives, which showed higher DAT affinity and selectivity than FP-C1T. These new ligands are attractive candidates for development of ?8F-labeled PET radiotracers for clinical imaging DAT in human brain. Our objectives on this Phase II project are to further synthesize and pharmacologically evaluate novel N- or 0-fluoroalkyl tropane derivatives with a view toward one-step simplified 18F-radiolabeling. The most promising compounds' physiochemical properties (lipophilicity) will be evaluated. A facile and rapid method of synthesis of 18F labeled tropane derivatives will be developed for the most promising compound(s). The lead compound in this series (presently BRL-308) will be evaluated by PET imaging and pharmacokinetics, in non-human primates. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: NOT AVAILABLE",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Effective suppression of jet engine noise by inlet and exhaust duct liners continues to be an important part of producing environmentally acceptable aircraft. Because methods for transfer of frequency-domain impedance data to time-domain boundary conditions are still under development, Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA) has yet to be used widely either to design new liners or predict pre-installation performance of existing ones. In addition, the methods that do currently exist are not easily extended to cover finite amplitude effects, whether they are due to high sound pressure levels or liner material nonlinearities. Nielsen Engineering and Research proposes to fill this need for a general, nonlinear, time-domain liner characterization scheme by novel application of Volterra (integral) series methods. Applying this modeling technique to data from a given liner results in forced, time-domain, differential equations for liner velocity response to an imposed acoustic pressure. The differential equations can be linear or nonlinear, and are generated using either existing frequency-domain impedance data or new time-domain acoustic pulse experiments. Once in existence, the equations can be discretized in any fashion consistent with the CAA calculation where they are used.",

Several target sequences in the cytomegalovirus genome will be evaluated for        their utility to identify viral DNA in the newborn specimen. The following           mutations in connexin 26, Pendrin, and connexin 31 genes serve as model systems      for hereditary hearing loss: (1) connexin 26 35 del G, 167 del T, .Usher2A           23l4delG;  (2) Pendrin L236S, T416P; Mitochondrial A1555G.

The Phase 1 research involved investigating a wide range of recent techniques and technologies, and performing analyses and trade-off studies to evaluate, select, and integrate them into a GPS-tracked buoy system (buoy, shore reference station for differential GPS, and repeater stations to optionally increase radio ranges). A key Phase 1 result is a preliminary prototype system design. The system should provide cm level water level accuracies. The buoy can be deployed and recovered from small vessels. During Phase 2, the system will be designed in detail, built, laboratory and field tested, and evaluated. Research will include developing the system software including GPS analyses, buoy motion corrections, and water level analyses. An operational system will be designed for Phase 3 commercialization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Phase I SBIR proposal will advance the characterization of TTL-3, a highly potent  derivative of a naturally occurring and orally available small molecule that inhibits tumor  necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) synthesis.  TTL-3 was designed and synthesized, and  its potency will be assessed in assays to be optimized in-house.  These assays include  in vitro  measurements of dose and time responses of cytokine gene expression by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human and murine lymphoid cells treated with TTL-3. The secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and  interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the anit-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10), will be monitored by ELISA.  The safety and oral availability of TTL-3 will be addressed in a murine model of escalating dose tolerance.  TTL-3 dose and time response and efficacy will be investigated  in an acute TNF-alpha-induced murine LPS mediated injury model and a chronic model of  collagen-induced (CIA) arthritis in mice.  These studies will address TTL-3 potency and mechanism for TNF-alpha inhibition and will provide an important basis for further assessment of therapeutic potential in the attached Phase II SBIR studies and in a Phase I/II clinical trial for rheumatoid arthritis. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The clinical efficacy of injectable drugs such as Enbrel and Remicade in RA and IBD has proven the importance of targeting TNF-alpha.  However the multiple side effects of these inhibitors suggests certain advantages of an oral small molecule TNF-alpha synthesis inhibitor such as TTL-3 over other approaches: Oral dosing with rapid absorption for greater patient acceptability; Specific activity for  pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-alpha; Pharmacology suggests no long-term immunosuppression; Non-immunogenic, small molecule with easier manufacturing and lower cost; Potential use in combined therapy with other anti-inflammatory therapies. The understanding of the clinical activities of TNF-alpha inhibitors has simplified our ability to develop TTL-3.  The potential use of TTL-3 alone or in combination with other anti-inflammatory therapies opens new clinical and marketing opportunities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A new fission powered space power and propulsion system based on using a non-moving fissile gas is proposed. The main innovation in the proposed fission based propulsion system is the use of well-established fusion plasma confinement and compression methods to achieve a supercritical condition in a highly subcritical fissile gas. In particular, electromagnetic induced shock wave compaction and gas dynamic trap techniques are merged to bring a relatively small volume ( 1 m3) of a fissile (235U, 233U, or 239Pu) compound gas (such as UF4) to prompt supercriticality condition, thereby, releasing an intense pulse of fission power. A magnetic field compaction scheme is designed to directly convert the fission energy to electricity. The specific energy of the proposed nuclear electric system for megawatt level power operation is well above 1 kWe/kg. An alternative direct propulsion system is designed based on using a merger between Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF) and hydrodynamic confinement techniques to achieve long duration ( 100 to 1000 ms) criticality and ultrahigh burnup in a fissile gas. The MTF technique induces a large pressure ratio ( 10) adiabatic compaction of fissile gas by rapid collapsing of a cylindrical layer of a low neutron absorbing metal (Al or Zr). Hydrodynamic confinement in a leaky reversed mirror configuration is used to contain and direct the fission plasma through a nozzle, thereby, generating intense thrust ( 100s of klb) at specific impulse levels in excess of 2000 seconds.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) EEG technology has advanced substantially with respect to digital processing capability during the past 20 years. However, the process of transducing the very small cerebral electrical signals at the scalp surface remains difficult, requiring very low and balanced contact impedances to achieve acceptable levels of line frequency (60 Hz) noise. Preparation of scalp sites using solvents, abrasives and syringe needles to match amplifier system input requirements is time consuming, costly and especially burdensome in neonatal and critical care patients. Based on Phase I success, a preparation-free EEG technology will be completed that would entirely eliminate scalp site preparation with solvents, abrasive compounds and needles, etc. Setup time for clinical and experimental protocols would be reduced to the time required to make physical contact. In addition to time savings, it will eliminate the need for shielded enclosures, simplify recordings in noisy environment such as intensive care units, and end patient irritation and the risk of infection from scalp puncture during abrasion. Two low-cost implementations of the technology will be developed: an EEG transduction module (ETM) to serve as a compact, in-line, modular retrofit to existing EEG/Evoked potential systems and an EEG System Module (ESM) that would serve as a complete amplifier system capable of connecting to notebook and desktop PC's equipped with a \"Firewire\" (IEEE 1394) serial bus port. The ETM will upgrade any EEG/EP system to \"preparation-free\" functionality and for most, substantially improve overall signal-to-noise performance. The ESM software package will feature object-oriented programmability, conferring unprecedented user control and flexibility. Both devices will enable the uncomplicated use of electrode caps. Production versions of both devices will be field tested at established clinical and research sites, providing realistic opportunities to identify and correct weaknesses or \"bugs.\"",

The current device uses a chest-mounted, shoulder position sensor. With the proposed device, control signals could be derived from weak myoelectric activity, making it possible for patients without sufficient shoulder mobility to use the neuroprosthesis. Myoelectric control is currently utilized in commercially available electromechanical prostheses.  During the completed Phase I study, an electronic device was developed that records myoelectric signals and removes stimulation artifacts. A preliminary study was conducted with spinal-cord-injured and able-bodied subjects that demonstrated the feasibility of using myoelectric signals as a control source. During the proposed Phase II study, a pre-production device will be developed for myoelectric control of the neuroprosthesis. A clinical investigation will be conducted to demonstrate the utility of the myoelectric control system. The investigation participants will evaluate myoelectric control of their existing neuroprosthesis in daily use. It is anticipated that the participants will prefer myoelectric control due to improved durability, increased cosmetic appeal, and improved usability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         One subset of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily is that which is activated by a peptide carrying an obligatory positively charged residue (GPCR-PA+). This subclass is exemplified by receptors for melanocortins, GnRH galanin, MCH, orexin and chemokine receptors variously involved in eating disorders, reproductive disorders, pain, narcolepsy, obesity, and inflammation. In Phase-I, a region of chemical property space enriched in GPCR ligands was identified. This was used to design and synthesize a 'test' library of 2025 single, pure compounds to sample portions of this property space associated with GPCR-PA+ ligands. This library was evaluated by high-throughput screening against three different receptors and found to be highly enriched in ligands (4.5 to 61-fold) compared to a control set of 2024 randomly selected compounds. In Phase II we propose to expand the size of this library to at least 6749 compounds to complete the sampling of this GPCR-PA+ ligand-rich region and to better define it's borders. This completed library will be screened against an expanded array of receptor targets and hits so identified used as a starting point for lead optimization against a selected target. The resulting library should be a valuable resource for the rapid identification of ligands to a range of therapeutically important receptors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         During phase I we developed and tested a force measurement system that provides a fast, objective and quantitative description of the optimal pattern of grasping forces using in a bimanual manipulation task in humans. The system can quantitatively approximate the state of the motor system in terms of efficiency and precision, as force is the fundamental building block of movement. Our system is the first to simultaneously measure and provide a comprehensive assessment of grasping forces during bimanual object manipulation. The market for this system is growing as the quantification of movement is of interest to a wide range of professionals including bioengineers, biomechanists, clinicians, educators, ergonomists/human factor engineers, geriatricians, neuroscientists, psychologists, and rehabilitation specialists. The Phase II objectives are: 1. To expand the reliability, accuracy and generalizability of the system. 2. Continue to improve the hardware of the system. 3. Performing an extended analysis of the force and torque data produced by each limb and identifying how these variables may relate to other measures. 4. Create optional protocols to improve the flexibility of the system. 5. Streamline the user interface so it complies with recent PC interaction standards. 6. Imp5ove methods of visualizing the data. Our system combines portability, flexibility and innovative analyses to effectively assess the state of the motor system in bimanual force control. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The assessment of movement impairments can be more objective through the evaluation of forces exerted by the hands during an object manipulation task that resembles daily activities. Quantifying force patterns between hands provides an opportunity to assess how individuals control and coordinate forces. No similar movement analysis system is available. The potential marker consists of neurological clinics, motor control research laboratories, health insurance companies, and human factors assessment centers.",

The software requires a PC and a digitizer and/or mouse to record and analyze rapid goal-directed movements from a home position to a target position in terms of sub-movements. The primary sub-movement is associated with preprogrammed movement towards the target. The secondary sub-movement comprises the subsequent corrections necessary to achieve the target. In Phase II we extend the software to improve the versatility and the user-friendliness. We then will implement and conduct two standardized sub-movement analysis tests. One test compares different muscle systems and different accuracy demands and the other compares visual feedback adaptation and learning, Subsequently, we will apply these tests to compare various factors affecting the sub-movement structure, other types of movements, and evaluate in practice and motor\r learning.

This project will develop a large area, position-sensitive neutron detector for the SNS, based upon manufacturing a solid film that contains both scintillating and neutron absorbing material.  In Phase I, two organic and eight inorganic scintillators were identified as having the short fluorescence, <100 ns, needed to achieve high neutron detection rates.  A chemistry was developed to allow the scintillators to be mixed into a lithiated sol-gel and a stabilization coating was identified.  Experimental measurements demonstrated neutron detection in every lithiated sol-gel film.  Films containing a MINOS polystyrene organic scintillator had the fastest response.  Of the inorganics, the CaS:Ce, the LSO, and the UAG yielded neutron detection efficiencies that could be utilized in the SNS.  Phase II will experimentally test the scintillators/lithiated-glass-film combinations in order to identify formulations that can be manufactured in volume at a commercially viable cost.  The test program will be tailored to the practical needs of the SNS for their facility.            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The primary application is for use at the Spallation Neutron Source being constructed in Oak Ridge, TN.  The sol-gel glass films should have secondary application to national defense needs for locating fissile material hidden in containers that could be smuggled into the United States or across borders.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         NEWTEC Services Group, Inc. proposes that a safe, expedient, and cost effective means of reclaiming contaminated lands from landmines and UXO can be achieved through the implementation of engineered plant-based fluorescent bioreporters.  This technology isbased upon a previous microbial mine detection program, where microbes would excite and fluoresce in the presence of TNT vapors from UXO and landmine hazards in the soil.  However, plants provide a much greater surface area in their leaves and stems for abrighter fluorescent signal generation, and their root systems accumulate the explosives from subsurface soils where they occur in much higher concentration.  These added advantages will significantly increase the probability of detecting UXO, landminesand explosvie waste hazards from an airborne platform.  The focus of the research effort is to generate and evaluate fluorescent signatures of genetically modified plants and tailor the plant(s) fluorescence to optimize the use of existing passive oractive imaging technology from an airborne platform for the wide area detection of these hazards and concentrations in the field. With respect to UXO recovery programs and international humanitarian demining initiatives, the technology could assist in thediscrimination of UXO areas and minefields through the identification of both patterns and random dispersals around specific structures that were targeted during previous conflicts or at test facilities and impact areas.  Since landmines and UXO hazardsare deployed randomly over long distances, and encircle small villages, bridges, RR lines and infrastructure sites (hydro-electric stations, power lines, oil & gas reserves and utilities), this technology expedites the detection and recovery of thesehazards for humanitarian benefits and land reclamation/reutilization programs.  Including the recovery of existing infrastructure, and facilitating access to new oil, gas, mineral resources and agricultural lands.",

BE itself is not malignant, but it is the primary risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma, and a significant number of patients with BE will have adenocarcinoma at the time of first endoscopy. Currently, examination for dysplasia requires numerous random biopsy samples. This work will complete the development and clinically test an optical instrument for detecting and grading Barrett's dysplasia. Light scattering spectroscopy (LSS) has already been shown to differentiate between normal and diseased tissue conditions in BE patients, but the analysis is complex so the data is analyzed after the procedure is over. The instrument developed by this work will be based on white light LSS, but it will use a special probe design and data reduction algorithm, developed by NLI, enabling real-time results. The probe design makes use of the properties of light scattering by cell nuclei and other tissue components to enable the separation and subtraction of interfering effects, and the characterization of the nuclei, based on using spectral, angular, and polarization characteristics of the scattering processes. The tissue characterization follows from the instrument's quantitative determination of the nuclear size and number density for the surface mucosal cells - two properties commonly used by pathologists. Specifically, NLI will (i) produce the probe, (ii) calculate the data base for the real-time algorithm, (iii) produce the instrument with light source, spectrometer, and embedded computer (suitable for interface with a standard clinical video endoscope), (iv) verify the instrument operation in the laboratory using standard scattering materials, (v) verify the background subtraction properties by using normal and diseased resected colon tissue, and (vi) conduct clinical studies on patients with Barrett's Esophagus.",

In Phase I, the chemical, electrochemical, and processing-related properties of ceria-based anodes and electrolytes were evaluated.  Selected materials were fabricated into SOFCs using low cost manufacturing techniques, and cathode materials were evaluated for low temperature operation.  In Phase II, composite cathode materials will be developed for a range of near and long-term electrolyte systems.  Novel electrochemical screening techniques will be used to select materials for evaluation.  The anode supported ceria geometrics, identified in Phase I, will serve as test cells for low-temperature evaluation.

        "abstract": "Abstract         65083     The field emission electron source is a key element in powerful electron microscopes that characterize matter on the atomic scale, but the brightness, coherence, and stability are no longer sufficient to investigate materials at the level of resolution demanded by modern industry.  Specifically, brightness needs to be improved by a factor of ten, the energy spread needs to be decreased 2-3 times, and the overall stability, reliability, and user-friendliness all must be improved substantially.  This project will develop a 200 keV field emission electron source using a Zr/O/W(100) or similar low workfunction emitter.  The new source is expected to have unprecedented brightness (>1010A cm-2 sr-1eV-1 at 200 keV), monochromaticity (<0.2 eV), and longevity (>10 hours between emitter cleanings, >10 years lifetime of the emitter), surpassing all existing electron sources.  Phase I developed and tested a new type of electron source with the desired properties:  increased brightness, decreased energy spread, and improved longevity.  The source, using a Zr/O/W(100) cathode operated at liquid nitrogen temperature, achieved a workfunction of 2.7 eV, angular confinement of emission to within 4, emission noise <0.1%, and >8 hours between cleanings.  Phase II will develop a new type of electron accelerator that allows the electron source to be held at 78K in an ultra-clean, ultra-high vacuum.  New high-voltage electronics also will be developed with extensive computer control that provides unprecedented stability at 200 keV and completely automated operation.              Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The new source should ultimately be incorporated in an advanced electron microscope that will provide revolutionary new capabilities for imaging and analyzing matter.  The world-wide market for such instruments is greater than $500 million, and there is no U.S. manufacturer.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Nitrate is one of the most widely determined anions in all spheres of agriculture. Economical and environmentally responsible crop production now requires that farmers know the concentration of nitrate in soil-and increasingly, in the sap of developing plants-to determine the amount and timing of fertilizer application to their fields. Nitrate is classified as a primary contaminant under the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts, and it has been identified as a major water quality problem in many agricultural regions where runoff and drainage from croplands contaminate surface water and groundwater. The demand for nitrate analysis in these regions to support monitoring and remediation activities is therefore likely to increase substantially. Nutrient management programs now under development in many parts of the country to regulate the discharge of wastes from confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) will further increase the demand for nitrate analysis. This burgeoning demand for agriculturally related nitrate analysis provides the economic incentives to develop faster, cheaper, more environmentally benign reagents and analytical systems for laboratory and on-site nitrate analysis despite the ready availability of time honored and effective nitrate determination methods. Automated methods for nitrate determination, U.S. EPA method 353.2 for example, are widely used in the United States and throughout the world. In such methods, nitrate is reduced to nitrite by small, packed-bed, cadmium reactors. Nitrite is subsequently reacted with Griess reagents-sulfanilamide and N-(1-Naphthyl)ethylenediamine-to form a stable and highly colored product that is ideal for determination by photometry. Cadmium required by these methods, however, is a highly toxic heavy metal. Its use exposes analysts to a potent health hazard, and generates a cadmium contaminated waste stream, which must be collected for proper disposal. Enzymatic nitrate reduction is an attractive alternative to the cadmium-based chemistry. Enzymatic reactions are rapid, extremely selective, and nontoxic. They are safer for the user and for the environment, and can improve lab economy by reducing costs of hazardous waste disposal. NECi has developed reliable nitrate analysis tools based on its proprietary NADH:nitrate reductase (NaR) enzyme, which is isolated from corn seedlings. Our company is also developing new and potentially less expensive NaR reagent tools using genetic engineering and protein expression technologies, under funding from the SBIR program of NIH (Phase II award #R44 GM56598). The goal of this project is to develop manufacturable and cost-competitive reagent systems using NADH:Nitrate Reductase (NaR) as a direct replacement for the cadmium now widely used for nitrate determinations in standard CF (air-segmented continuous flow) and FI (flow injection) methods. Reagent packages using enzyme in solution will be compared to immobilized enzyme reactors. Technical feasibility was demonstrated in Phase I.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this project is development of simple, enzyme-based nitrate test kits for on-site feed and crop analysis. Many plant species accumulate nitrate, especially in times of stress such as drought. Nitrate levels can be high enough to pose a toxicity risk to livestock: consumption of excess nitrate can suppress rate of growth, low birth weight or stillbirths, reduced milk production, and even death especially in ruminants. Silage from high-nitrate crops can give off dangerous amounts of highly toxic NOx gases as they ferment. Farmers and crop consultants need a reliable and easy way to determine whether and when to harvest hays, grasses, and maize for feed. The Phase I project was designed to determine whether our nitrate test method and kits can become useful tools for agricultural extension personnel, food and feed chemists, crop consultants, researchers, farmers, and others. The proof-of-concept stage demonstrated that nitrate determinations based on enzymatic nitrate reduction by corn seedling nitrate reductase (NaR) can yield reliable data on nitrate content for feed and crop plants. Our results, and those of our collaboration partners, have demonstrated the feasibility of the method. The major objectives of the entire Phase I/Phase II project are: 1. To show that NaR-based nitrate analysis provides quantitative, reliable data in the lab using standard extraction techniques. 2. To develop a simplified test kit, similar in format to our Consumer NTK, that farmers and others can use on site. 3. To develop and validate quick and facile sample preparation techniques that provide extracts ready for analysis in the simplified test kits. 4. To validate that the method can provide data of sufficient reliability for making harvest and safety decisions on-site, in the field. An additional objective in Phase II will be the evaluation of recombinant NaR forms under development at NECi for use in these test kits. The advantage of recombinant NaR is the potential for lowering enzyme cost. Less expensive enzyme means we can use more NaR per assay, making the assay faster. Time is always a concern, for farmers, consultants and researchers alike. There is real need for improved methods for nitrate determination in the field. A dominant field nitrate assay used today is based on a color reaction of a diphenylamine/sulfuric acid mixture placed in a cavity bored into the corn stalk. This method lacks accuracy, and exposes the user to concentrated sulfuric acid. We believe the test kits under development in this project will provide data of stronger reliability, with dramatically reduced usage of hazardous materials for improved worker safety. A Field nitrate test kit capable of providing reliable nitrate information on-site will save time and money for farmers and consultants at harvest. A fast, safe and reliable nitrate test kit can help improve feed safety for livestock. As a collateral benefit, fast and simple test kits may be used for on-site soil testing, as an aid in avoiding application of excess nitrogenous fertilizers. Such kits may become useful tools for development of nutrient management plans.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Phase II SBIR project is a continuation of the research in which we proved the feasibility of an approach to the wide area standoff detection of explosives.  The approach consists of two main components:  a fluorescing sensor mechanism and aphoto-interrogation subsystem.  Two types of sensor mechanisms are being evaluated.  To this point in the project, we have concentrated on the use of beads coated with a remarkably sensitive amplifying fluorescent polymer (AFP) that has previously beendemonstrated to provide superior detection capabilities for explosives.  A second sensor mechanism involving microbes will be further explored during the completion of Phase I.  However, the results of the use of AFP-coated beads clearly indicates thatthis approach offers a promising mechanism for standoff detection.  We have been able to spread beads over soil, interrogate them from a distance, and readily identify areas of TNT contamination.  The response is strong, sensitive, and shows a highresistance to interference likely to be present in field environments.  During Phase II, we will improve the bead-polymer construct for improved dispersal and response and will test delivery and interrogation systems under realistic field conditions.Similar research will be conducted using microbes. This approach to standoff detection will be valuable in locating areas of UXO and mine fields.  Through functionalization of the polymer, analytes such as chemical agents, biological agents, and toxicindustrials chemicals can be detected.  This would permit the detection of harmful military, terrorist, and environmental contaminants at a distance, keeping personnel out of harm's way and allowing fast reconnaissance of large areas.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate the ability to generate photostimulated luminescence (PSL) in nanoparticles. The potential applications in digital imaging and storage offered by PSL phosphors, including X-ray imaging could be significant. PSL phosphors currently in use present several drawbacks including greater expense and poorer resolution as compared to conventional screen-film methods. The quantum confinement of nanoparticles offers solutions to many of the shortcomings of existing PSL phosphors. The project will characterize nanoparticles with a goal of optimizing these materials for use as phosphors in thin films. The project will also fabricate the required thin films and compare them to commercially available PSL phosphors for performance, longevity, and other factors of interest. The commercial applications will be widely applicable to digital imaging, offering high resolution, low cost, easy storage, low complexity, easy portability, and other desirable features. Materials with efficient PSL have great potential for technical applications such as optical storage, X-ray imaging, radiation measurements and quality control, optical dosimeters and dating, infrared sensors, image intensifiers, near-infrared-to-visible light converters, and bio-molecular structure recording and probing.",

A memory element consists of two magnetic filmsseparated by a thin ruthenium layer, with one of the film layers forming a tunnel junction with a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet for non-destructive read-out (NDRO).  Selection of a cell for writing is accomplished through a select transistor, with asingle write current passing through only one magnetic film sandwich in an array.   The memory cell can be configured from a single element for high speed, or from two elements for higher density.  Low write currents of 2.5 mA have been achieved with 3 nsswitching.  Niche memory products and reconfigurable elements are also potential applications.  Its scalability could also allow densities of 16 megabits per square centimeter using 0.15 micron lithography.

The proposed linear mode spin-valve digital isolators will overcome the shortcomings of the present latching mode spin-valve digital isolators. The devices can be designed to work either in the unipolar mode or bipolar mode. If operating in the unipolar mode, the devices will not only be fully pin-for-pin compatible with optocouplers but also have superior performance with regard to cost, size, power consumption (<35 mW), bandwidth (DC to 1 GHz) and radiation tolerance. If operating in the bipolar mode, the devices will significantly improve NVE's present latching mode digital isolators with much faster speed (>400Mbd) and at least 80% less power consumption. This Phase II proposal is directed towards designing, fabricating and optimizing single/multi-channel digital signal isolator devices. The linear spin-valve sensors used in these devices will be based on the Phase I result. Prototype, radiation hard, low power, high speed, miniature digital isolator devices, that meet space and other commercial requirements will be demonstrated, and these prototypes will be ready for Phase III commercialization.",

Techniques for maintaining the a constant distance between the eddy-current probe and the conductive surface despite intervening coatings will also be developed in this project. Such a system can be used to lengthen the lifetime of mission critical components such as aircraft bearings, which at present have to be replaced on schedule using rather conservative lifetime estimates. The main commercial application of these systems would be military and commercial aircraft. A simple system capable of rapidly scanning an area would require eddy-current probes that can inspect a large surface in a single pass. Compact and low-power arrays of GMR and Spin Dependent Tunneling (SDT) sensors developed for this program can be used in this application as well as other applications such as nanotechnolgy read heads to read implanted magnetic noise that is extremely difficult to compromise. The implications for more secure forms of identification are clear for the post 9/11 world.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  During phase I the feasibility of a test kit for the fluorometric measurement of HIV protease inhibitors (PI) in human serum has been demonstrated. The overall objective of this phase II investigation is the development of a robust fluorometric diagnostic test kit, trade name Levoprin-ZG, for clinical laboratories, to be used for therapeutic dose monitoring (TDM). The test results should be similar in accuracy with those obtained by HPLC/mass spectrometry (LCMS) and have demonstrated clinical applications (for FDA approval). Principle of the method: in the well of a microtiter plate the HIV protease degrades a specific substrate attached to a solid phase, which releases a fluorescent signal. In the presence of diluted patient serum containing PI the activity of the enzyme is inhibited in proportion to the concentration of PI. Dosing of PI is based on the level of drug necessary to inhibit HIV. However, achievement of therapeutic levels is influenced by multiple factors, including 1) individual variability in levels; from sub-therapeutic trough to toxic peak levels, which reduces adherence. 2) Poor adherence leading to development of resistant mutants. 3) Resistant mutants require genotypic or phenotypic characterization in order to identify the drug level required to suppress the virus in individual patients; under these circumstances (rescue) the PI levels need to be substantially increased, monitored closely and adjusted. For these reasons, clinicians have expressed the need for a rapid, sensitive and inexpensive TDM test to be performed close to the point of care and able to determine accurately the plasma and/or intracellular level of PI. However, the only available test is based on LCMS available at a relatively high cost at unique specialized reference laboratories. Here we will perform the research and development necessary to complete the stable and robust kit for clinical laboratories. We will perform clinical studies to demonstrate utility for monitoring adherence and making dose adjustment and to obtain FDA pre-market approval. Moreover, we will investigate the compartment to be measured for best clinical utility: total drug (current state of the art), free drug (there is significant protein binding) or intracellular (there is large individual variability in this compartment). The test kit will then be manufactured for sale to clinical laboratories.",

A new advanced photon counting type x-ray imaging system was proposed for Phase I because it combines the geometrical volume information obtained in theimaging process with spectral information obtained by measuring the attenuation of the x-rays at different energies.  This provides the user with a wealth of data that can be used in many diverse applications. X-ray imaging also needs very fast dataacquisition capability so that high-resolution images can be obtained quickly, which is essential for real-time NDI and NDE applications.  To achieve these goals major development efforts in two areas were needed.  The first effort was to develop highenergy resolution, room temperature, high atomic number (Z) linear pixel detector arrays which will work without polarization at high x-ray fluxes. The second was to develop an ultra fast mixed signal front end data acquisition ASIC (Application SpecificIntegrated Circuit) to read out the pixel detector array. Although only a feasibility study was intended during Phase I to study these issues, a breakthrough in detector development was achieved. Therefore, high-quality solid-state pixel detector arrayshave already been developed.  During Phase II we plan to improve the uniformity of the pixel detector arrays.  However, the main thrust of the Phase II work will be to develop the ultra fast mixed sig",

This new               technology allows a novel approach to drug discovery, called the Split-Maze,         based on the large scale generation and screening of variant receptors. We           randomize the receptor's binding site residues, resulting in expanded receptors      with enhanced recognition properties. For lead identification, we screen each        compound against thousands of variant receptors which results in identifying         novel and high potency lead compounds which act on variant receptors. For Lead       Optimization, we first identify the key interactions between the chemical            moieties of the lead compound and individual residues within the receptor so as      to guide docking of the compound into the receptor's binding site, resulting in      a biochemically derived structural model of the lead-receptor complex. In            addition, we analyze the changes in the identified lead-receptor interactions        to enhance the potency of the lead compound towards the receptor. The                structural template will then be used to convert the amino acid changes that         enhance the lead's potency into mirror-image modifications proposed on the           chemical compound, so as to optimize the lead compound's potency.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Our goal is discover a novel agonist to the melanocortin-4 receptor, which would be a potential antiobesity drug.  Conservative estimates predict a >5 billion market of an  antiobesity drug by the year 2005.   We are developing a novel approach to drug discovery that incorporates combinatorial biology on the receptor and can screen thousands of receptor variants in one step.  This new approach has the potential to develop higher quality leads, faster and cheaper than the current state of art.",

This beam of high-energy particles could be coupled to a direct energy converter ro produce electrical output, or be focused onto a target, directly forming a plasma exhaust. To enable early laboratory studies of the concept, an experiment is proposed using electrons to simulate fusion products, e.g. 14-MeV protons from D-He3 fusion. The approach proposed is to design an initial experimental collimator during Phase I. This experiment would utilize a low energy electron gun source to simulate fusion products. This Phase I design study would serve as the basis for the construction and testing of the electron collimator during Phase II. It is estimated that such an experiment could be done with a small fraction of the money required to build the full-scale proton collimator. Yet it would firmly establish the physics and engineering necessary to build an integrated IEC-proton collimator in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Continued interest in the enhancement of warhead liner performance has led to a number of studies focused on liner material ductility and consistency. Specifically, cold upset forging and annealing have been shown to produce significant grain refinementand texture development in liner plates of various materials. However, in tantalum, and possibly other warhead metals, variations in thermo-mechanical processing among different mills can persist as inconsistencies in the final plate, even following theextensive changes in microstructure occurring in cold forging and subsequent annealing. Equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) is a material conditioning process, involving grain boundary engineering, which by intensive shear deformation is able to produceultrafine grain sizes (nanostructures), without changing the overall shape of the piece. Application of this process to condition 2.5-inch diameter bar stock segments prior to the cold forging of plates could potentially erase any material bias fromprevious processing. Nanostructured metal also offers the potential for enhanced performance in tantalum or HCP metals due to its unusual combination of high strength and high ductility. This project will apply this sequence to three warhead materials,characterize the resulting structures and deliver 9-inch diameter plates to Eglin for testing.",

(OPT) successfully demonstrated inPhase I that the efficiency of existing Wave Energy Converter(WEC) systems can be improved at least 5 times by making changesin the areas of hydrodynamic design, hydraulic system design andelectric power conversion system design. These changes, coupledwith a modest increase in WEC size are expected to yield a systemthat generates 100 kW  alone or in groups for higher powerlevels. The Phase I study also showed that a 25 times improvementin efficiency can be achieved if more radical design changes areimplemented. This more aggressive design approach, whileattractive from a system efficiency and cost standpoint, hasseveral implementation and survivability issues that need to beaddressed.The Phase II Base program proposed by OPT further develops twoalternative WEC designs through computer simulation and wave tanktesting of 1/40th scale models. Upon completion of the sub-scalewave tank tests, one of the two WEC designs will be selected forfurther wave tank testing at a 1/6th scale level. Upon successfulcompletion of the Phase II program, a full-scale system can beocean tested as part of a Phase III program.BENEFITS: The development of a 100 kW ocean wave power generator is of significant importance in both the commercial and military sectors. This is particularly true for remote islands in the Pacific.  In these areas, the cost of importing and storingdiesel fuel is very hig",

These microbunches can be used to generate intense accelerating fields in dielectric microstructures, and possibly allow the future design of a high energy electron-positron collider that would be much smaller and less expensive than present technology permits. In Phase I, calculations were conducted to allow optimum chopping of a ~1 ps accelerated bunch into a train of about 30 ~4 fs, ~1-pC electron bunches spaced by 35 fs.  A configuration of quadrupole magnets was devised to manipulate transverse profiles of the micro-bunches into sheet-like form.  Theory and computations were carried out for wake fields and bunch stability when such bunches transverse planar dielectric accelerator structures.  Phase II will install (1) a beam stop for chopping a ~1 ps bunch into a train of about 30 ~4 fs, ~1pC bunches spaced by 35 fs;  (2) coherent synchrotron radiation diagnostics to infer the bunch lengths; and (3) quadrupole magnets to manipulate the bunches into sheet-like form for injection into a planar dielectric-lined wake field accelerator structure.

Yet few corresponding high-power components have been developed to provide rf power manipulation and transmission between the magnicon and the accelerator.  This project will develop a variety of high-power Ka-band rf components to remedy this situation.  These include waveguide tapers, right-angle miter bends, windows, mode converters, power combiners, mode launchers, phase shifters, dual directional couplers, and loads.  In Phase I, designs for all the components were developed; cold test versions of a taper, miter bend, mode converter, and power combiner were built and tested; and high-power versions of the dual directional coupler and load were built and installed on the magnicon output waveguides.  In Phase II, high-power, high-vacuum prototypes of all the components will be built and tested up to 45 MW.  Peak power limits for the components will be determined using a quasi-optical rf pulse compressor that is expected to produce levels up to 300 MW.

Although assays that reliably detect HPV are available, their prognostic value for predicting progression to cervical cancer remains controversial, underscoring the need for assays with improved prognostic value. This Phase II SBIR will develop a novel method for detecting integrated HPV DNA in cervical cells. Oncogenic HPV DNA integration into the host genome is a common occurrence in cervical cancers and dysplasias, and assays targeting this event may have high clinical value. Detection of integrated HPV DNA, however, is complicated by the frequent co-existence of episomal viral DNA. Using model cell lines which contain both episomal and integrated HPV DNA, and analytical methods such as in situ hybridization and PCR, Phase I research successfully detected integrated HPV DNA. Phase II research will optimize this approach for use with clinical samples and current liquid-based cytology methods. In contrast to conventional HPV tests, which identify viral types, this assay detects viral integration and targets a wider range of viral types, increasing assay sensitivity.

Phase I demonstrated feasibility by incorporating a proprietary nanomaterial in 20- by 50-micron channels etched in a glass microchip and performing chemical separation and surface-enhanced Raman spectral analysis of several test chemicals. Phase II will complete development of the microchip chemical analyzer by designing reproducible plastic microchip cards that fit into an integrated micro-fluidics and Raman system. Development will include the following chemicals: p-aminobenzoic acid, phenyl acetylene, adenine, acetaminophen, secobarbitol, cocaine, and related metabolites. The microchip analyzer will have broad commercial value to the agricultural, biotech, chemical agents, environmental, medical and pharmaceutical industries. Specifically, the microchip is being designed to measure drugs and metabolites in body fluids to aid clinical trials of new drugs, assist dosage control of chemotherapeutic drugs, and diagnose drug overdose.",

Currently, only about 3% of civilian physicians are using an EMR system. The DoD's medical facilitiesmust operate over a much larger spectrum of scenarios than those of its civilian counterparts. These encompass all the civilian cases, such as primary care medicine in a clinic environment, through the various medical specialties like surgery, pediatrics,and so forth, to the demanding environment of battlefield medicine.This program will deliver to the OSD a computerized medical records system with an advanced user interface between the CHCS II medical system and wireless handheld MDAs.Key features of this system include handheld, anytime, anywhere, wireless access; a next-generation user-interface to improve data input, retrieval, and comprehension; and platform independence.  Key technologies involved include 802.11x and Bluetoothwireless protocols, browser technology with strong encryption, ODBC to interface to any major medical database back-end, XML data output, and HL7 compliance. Features leverage other emerging technologies, such as handwriting recognition, voice command, PICreaders, and all manners of portable computers for which browsers are written.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose to develop an Optical Air Data System (OADS) to measure air vehicle airspeed, Mach number, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature, angles of attack and sideslip, and air density using a non-intrusive technique termed Rayleigh/Mie lidar. Currently, these parameters are measured using numerous sensors that cannot perform adequately for high-performance/high-speed aircraft. Recent research into OADS has focused on coherent Mie (aerosol) lidar, which fail in many flight regimes due to insufficient aerosol scattering. Moreover, Mie lidar cannot measure temperature or pressure. Rayleigh (molecular) lidar overcomes these shortcomings by scattering from the air itself to provide velocity, temperature and pressure. Rayleigh/Mie lidar has the additional benefit of providing improved velocity measurements when sufficient aerosols exist. Thus, OPHIR's Rayleigh/Mie OADS offers performance, weight and cost savings advantages not provided by any other commercially available or developing technology.The Phase I research effort has been very successful. All objectives were met and all tasks successfully completed. This research has proven the feasibility of a Rayleigh/Mie lidar OADS. Phase II will include the development of a flyable prototype. The Boeing Company will provide flight-testing, and Goodrich Aerospace will perform wind tunnel testing, at no cost to the Phase II effort.",

The effort is based on the spectacular success of the Phrase I effort of demonstrating the concept at a single pixel level, which will form thebasis of the two-dimensional imaging systems.  Spectral-polarimetric imaging utilizes all three characteristics of light, intensity, wavelength, and polarization to add a new dimension to imaging by providing complete information about the image.  Theproposed polarization based imaging systems is expected to significantly enhance the capabilities of object identification and differentiation, which will be very useful in target acquisition and identification particularly in difficult environments.  Forexample, certain polarization states of light have been shown to be impervious to the effects of scattering by aerosols (smoke, fog, etc.).  In addition, the light transmitted or reflected from an object has a polarization signature that offers means foridentification of the material characteristics of the target object (e.g., ice on a wing surface).  The first year milestone is to develop a fast compact spectral polarimeter operating in the IR range,  followed by a milestone of delivering a imagingspectral polarimetric system in the 3Q of the second year.",

Because of the greater dispersion in the visible, specifically in towards the blue spectrum, chromatic aberrationbecomes more difficult to control. In addition, packaging to meet a specific helmet layout configuration also becomes a challenge.  Packaging can be very simple with no folds, but this configuration results in a large shift in the helmet center of gravityaway from the user causing significant fatigue for the user.  Configurations with multiple folds allow the CG closer to be closer to the user at the cost of added complexity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Phase I research and analyses have confirmed the potential of wavefront sensing in providing the necessary information to accurately control interferometers. The concept involves data processing on the interferometer output signals to determine the adjustments required to achieve the desired interferometer performance. It is particularly valuable in advanced space interferometry missions where conventional metrology instrumentation may not be adequate in providing the necessary alignment data. The resulting information is useful in controlling the optical elements, and, in cases where the optical components are carried on separate spacecraft flying in formation, useful in controlling the spacecraft.The signal-processing and image-processing techniques developed in Phase I are relatively generic in nature. For Phase II research, the selection of a specific space interferometer mission concept is proposed to provide the basis for more-detailed development of the wavefront-sensing concept. A comprehensive control structure for the optical components and their host spacecraft will be designed to address the real-world control issues. New data-processing techniques will be developed to handle the realistic interferometer signals expected from operational deployment. High-fidelity test beds are considered for evaluation of the technologies.",

These methodologies combine the notions of Lyapunov stability and dissipativity in nonlinear dynamic system theory with the concepts of connective stability and robustness from decentralized control theory. The proposed research builds upon a recent research effort that resulted in the development of a software environment for ATM stability and robustness analysis. Phase I research will develop the computational algorithms and will demonstrate their use in a high-fidelity simulation of the air-traffic-management system. Scenarios illustrating the practical use of these algorithms to gauge the stability properties of the ATM environment will also be developed during Phase I research. Based on the Phase I research results, Phase II work will develop computational modules that can be integrated with air-traffic-management decision aids such as CTAS to provide real-time information about the ATM system stability and robustness. After adequate testing and evaluation of the proposed algorithms, the stability and robustness information can be used as a decision aid for intervention by centralized air-traffic-control entities in the distributed ATM environment.",

The PAS also is compatible with ITS and telematics concepts and equipment.During the proposed phase II, final specifications will be determined based on simulations of sensor performance, crash data analysis an simulation, communication link simulation, and user focus groups.  The specifications drive the detailed design, which, when approved, will be implemented in 10 prototypes.  Graduated field tests under increasingly realistic conditions will validate the system performance and provide ideas for modifications and enhancements.

With a novel optical coupling system, a 5cm2 switch can block 10 kV and conduct 25 kA with a rise-time of <10ns.  The low jitter from optical activation, allows for parallel (MA) and/or series (MV) arrangement to meet demanding DOD and commercial pulsed power requirements.

Optimized diffusion profiles to maximize the blocking voltage while enabling faster turn-on and a reduced on-state voltage.

This toolis critical to field maintenance of stealth vehicles, potentially affecting the health and safety of both the vehicle and its occupants. For the last three years, OptoMetrix has been working with the Boeing Company to develop a free-space broadbandmicrowave spectrometer for use on stealth vehicles. The core technology of this instrument is the generation and detection of short (10's of picosecond) microwave pulses, which provides a wide bandwidth in a simple, compact package. At the same time, theBoeing Company was developing near field microwave probes for narrow band interrogation of material properties. Our Phase I effort demonstrated that the combination of these two technologies for producing a broadband, near field tool exceeded ourexpectations for sensitivity and material discrimination. This tool promises to meet or exceed the demands of field maintainability and thereby minimize the risks to personnel and equipment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Currently, active cooling of pressure transducers is required in high temperature sections of turbine engines, which limit their use to ground-based engine tests.  Lacking high temperature pressure measurement capabilities, turbine engines must operatewithin a wide engine performance margin, which limits the true performance capability of the engine, reduces fuel economy and aircraft range.  A flight-ready, high temperature pressure transducer would enable advanced engine controls for improved aircraftand engine performance, extended range and fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and engine health monitoring capabilities.  The Phase I program successfully demonstrated a fast response, high temperature shape memory alloy (HTSMA) pressure sensing elementsuitable for harsh turbine engine applications without the need for active cooling.  This Phase II program will build upon these successful results to produce a flight-ready, HTSMA pressure transducer that will be tested in turbine engine ground or flighttests at Pratt & Whitney's test facility.  Orbital Research has received much interest though our working relationships with key turbine engine organizations and manufacturers, such as the Propulsion Instrumentation Working Group and Pratt & Whitney.Continued collaboration with Orbital Research's turbine engine industry team will ensure product readiness and reliability in harsh turbine engine environments.",

These electrodes have the potential to significantly improve quality of care and reduce total cost of biopotential signal analysis by reducing the time and preparation required to obtain a good signal and reducing the total cost of fabricating high quality electrodes. The Phase I results showed feasibility of fabricating dry electrode structures on rigid substrates onto low-cost flexible substrates. However, further work is necessary to optimize the fabrication processes and to ensure that the lowest cost and highest performing flexible dry electrode systems and fabrication processes are chosen to establish a solid foundation for future use. The key objectives of this Phase II project include parallel development of two particularly promising fabrication techniques, selection of a single fabrication technique for further development, and testing and evaluation of the capabilities of the  dry electrodes in clinical environments. \r      The commercial applications of this project will be  in the area of physiological monitoring of patients in a clinical setting. Physiological measurements such as ECG (electrocardiogram), EMG (electromyogram), and EEG (electroencephalogram) are expected to benefit from the use of dry electrodes, in part due to the reduced time and preparation needed to apply the electrodes and in part, due to the elimination of abrasive skin prepping and electrolytic gels in the measurement procedure.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this NIH Phase II proposal is to develop, fabricate and clinically test a dry micro-machined physiologic recording electrode that can be used without requiring electrolytes and/or skin preparation. Traditionally, the monitoring of human physiological data requires attaching electrodes to the skin with adhesive collars, tape, or collodion after the skin has been vigorously cleaned to reduce electrical contact impedance. This approach is both time-consuming and troublesome. Therefore, a need exists for physiological recording electrodes that do not require exorbitant technician set-up time and vigorous skin preparation of the patient to be monitored. The proposed dry physiological recording electrodes have an innovative micro-machined surface that enables fast application times without causing patient discomfort. Recent tests showed the feasibility of producing micro-topographical features on the dry electrode surface that penetrate through the high impedance dead skin cells making excellent electrical contact with the patient even on hairy parts of the test subject. The recorded physiological signals (EEG and EMG) were comparable to adjacently mounted conventional electrodes. This Phase II program will optimize and further develop micro-machined electrodes to collect EEG, EMG, EOG, ECG, etc, from a variety of patients regardless of skin thickness and amount of hair.",

The thin liquid film of propellants is vaporized and brought to ignitiontemperature by the adjacent swirling combustion process.  CFD codes are being used to model the injection and mixing of the non-Newtonian fluids.  Propellant vaporization and combustion in the flow field are included in the model.  Customized subroutineswill be used to treat geometry variations, and propellant alternatives, and to link codes.  In Phase II, proposed herein, chamber hot-fire testing in the form of statistical test matrices will validate and refine the model.

This lightweight approach to 3D simulation makes it possible to: (1) electronically transmit materials to physically distributed mission participants, (2) run 3D simulations on COTS portable computers used on-orbit, and (3) economically apply the technology to broad application areas in procedures training. This approach is made possible by a rapid applications development system built specifically for the creation of network friendly 3D simulation. The Phase 1 project was intended to validate the concept of using lightweight 3D simulation for spaceflight applications. The Phase 2 project will greatly expand the applications of this approach by enabling collaborative use of the training materials. This will allow 3D simulation based training and operations support to be conducted collaboratively by geographically distributed participants using existing low bandwidth Internet connections. Thus, VCTOSS can have significant implications to (1) increase efficiency and effectiveness of preflight and flight-based training, (2) provide additional opportunity for real-time interactive support employing 3D models with expert collaboration, and (3) increase the ability to recovery from off-nominal situations, which may have significant performance and safety implications.",

The outer region of the flow field prevents the hot combustion products from contacting the wall. Though the chamber walls are subject to radiant heat transfer, one of the propellants provides effective wall cooling to prevent thermal degradation of the chamber. The Cool-Wall Vortex Combustion Chamber (CWVCC) offers several advantages over conventional liquid rocket engine designs. Avoiding severe thermal cycling of the chamber will extend chamber lifetime and allow for simple, lightweight, low-cost chamber designs. The vortex acts as an effective flame holder and may prevent combustion instability. The spinning vortices also provide an extended flow path much longer than the geometric length of the chamber. The chamber length may thus be reduced for a significant weight savings. The enhanced shear mixing should produce high combustion efficiencies. Engines featuring this technology should offer high reusability, high performance, long life, and low cost. Phase I will include numerical flow field analysis, lab-scale engine design, fabrication, parametric hot-fire testing using oxygen and hydrogen, data analysis, and large-scale preliminary engine designs for Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The purpose of the Phase II SBIR is to develop, build and test methods and procedures to control water, oxygen, and temperature in the root zone of a particulate based microgravity nutrient delivery system using nubs, tubes or plates. Phase I demonstrated new concepts for nutrient flow and control interval to each root module. Phase II will fully characterize a root module system capable of controlling oxygen and CO2 concentrations, and temperature of the root zone. Particulate based nutrient delivery systems have been commonly used in current space based plant growth systems and have been demonstrated to maintain healthy plants in microgravity, but have not controlled oxygen. The primary effort of this proposed project will be oriented toward building a system that can effectively control water and oxygen distribution in a root zone through manipulation of liquid source, flow, and aeration. This system will focus on aeration maintenance with and without root mass, measure and compare the impact of different water delivery sources and flows protocols, combined with various mechanisms of aeration, on the root zone environment. This research will allow the development of a root zone nutrient delivery system that will support plants in microgravity, without limiting oxygen.",

To remove these limitations, this project will develop neutron detectors using a novel pixel-cell design in a modular configuration.  The self-contained detector modules will be grouped into versatile, large-area detector arrays of customized size and resolution.  In Phase I, solutions to basic design and fabrication problems with pixel-cell detector modules were found; demonstration modules were developed and tested; and connector plates, interfaces, and the electronic systems architecture also were developed.  In Phase II, the basic concepts will be expanded, necessary production facilities for manufacturing a line of detector modules will be developed and built, prototypic microcircuits will be fabricated, and full scale evaluation modules will be built.            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The modular pixel-cell detector technology should find immediate application at existing or future neutron scattering facilities.  Not only does this open a significant market worldwide, but also greatly enhances the utilization of power and resolution capabilities of these facilities, which are currently limited by the characteristics of existing neutron detectors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Reading failure occurs in our schools at unacceptably high levels, causing serious and widespread social, political, and economic problems. This occurs despite the availability of effective instructional programs. Unfortunately, teachers often do not have the necessary training or time to implement these programs. In addition, it is sometimes not cost effective to use these programs with small or scattered student programs. This project will incorporate advanced speech recognition technology with the computer delivery of an effective, research-proven reading programs to effectively and economically teach basic reading skills to elementary redial and at-risk students. In Phase I, the first ten lessons were produced and evaluated with low- performing students using a speech recognizer trained by our staff for local dialect and similar students receiving \"standard care.\" In a randomized trial, the treatment subjects improved significantly more than controls on phonemic segmentation. In Phase II, we will develop the complete 100 speech recognition remedial reading program for elementary students. The program will include a speech recognition engine that is sensitive to the dialect regions of the United States, complete multimedia presentation of instructional content, printed materials and all necessary hardware. The effectiveness of the program will be tested in a randomized control trial.",

Employing an interactive format, program users will develop the skills needed to recognize inappropriate touching behavior within the context of specific relationship types and to respond to these inappropriate behaviors in ways which minimize the risk of sexual victimization. The program will employ a rule-based decision-making approach and will include on-screen assessment and immediate remediation of any concepts that program users fail to master. This rule-based design will incorporate principles of Direct Instruction and mastery learning to address the unique learning needs of MRDD youth. Because these \"stand-alone\" programs will be designed for independent use by youth with MRDD, they can be used efficiently and effectively across a wide variety of settings including: special education and/or resource rooms, libraries, regular-classrooms, medical clinics, vocational training programs, residential services, and family homes. The interactive programs will be delivered via CD-ROM and over the Internet/Intranet. Program evaluation will employ a randomized wait-list control design in which 200 MRDD individuals will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention or to a wait-list control condition.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Although bicycle collisions are one of the leading causes of death and severe injury in young children, our review shows that there are currently no empirically-based easily implemented prevention programs targeting bicycle safety skills. This project will develop an interactive multimedia program to teach bicycle safety skills. This project will develop an interactive multimedia program to teach bicycle safety skills to children in grades K-3, for use in both school and home settings. The Phase I prototype successfully used animated and live-video presentation to teach children one of the most important bicycle safety skills crossing the roadway. The critical features of this Project are the utilization of interactive media for the instructional presentation to the individual user, the incorporation of instructional design features that have been shown to achieve maximum learning, and the application of safety skills in video-based examples of real-life traffic situations. The program will incorporate computer-based assessment with remediation to ensure content mastery. Phase II development will expand the interactive bicycle safety program to include a comprehensive set of bicycle safety skills (e.g., playing safely near streets, crossing with no intersections, walking in a neighborhood, crossing parking lots) across urban, suburban, and rural environments. The program will be evaluated in a randomized control trial. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Multimedia educational software is a growing field, with both schools and home users comprising a large customer base. The individualization afforded by multimedia, combined with superior instructional design and remediation as needed, make this CD-ROM and Internet product a simple cost-effective way for schools to teach bicycle safety. This product will be attractive to parents seeking new ways to teach children safety skills.",

Unfortunately, these valves often deteriorate in younger pediatric       \r  patients. The objective of this proposal is development of cryopreservation        \r  methods that cause less interstitial damage than methods currently employed for    \r  preservation of human heart valves. In Phase I we demonstrated significant         \r  interstitial ice in heart valves during \"conventional\" cryopreservation. Since     \r  Phase I we have developed relatively non-cytotoxic methods for molecular ice       \r  control resulting in either modified or elimination of ice during                  \r  cryopreservation. In this Phase II proposal ice control formulations will be       \r  screened using assays of structural deterioration, calcification, ice              \r  formation, morphology and cell viability using rat or sheep heart valve-derived    \r  tissues.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Fresh osteochondral allografts have been proven clinically effective. However, the logistics of getting fresh, viable cartilage from donor to recipient requires the development of tissue banking methods. Conventional cryopreserved osteochondral grafts perform poorly in vivo and it is well established, in other tissue systems, that conventional cryopreservation often results in potentially damaging ice formation, both in the cells and in the surrounding extracellular matrix. In Phase I, we performed feasibility testing of an alternative ice-free cryopreservation method known as vitrification in a rabbit model. Fresh, conventionally cryopreserved, and vitrified specimens were compared. The results demonstrated 80-85 percent cell viability in vitrified specimens and similar performance of fresh and vitrified cartilage in vivo. In contrast, frozen cryopreserved specimens had low cell viability, correlating with the distribution of ice, and poor performance in vivo. In this Phase II proposal, testing of vitrification as a storage method for articular cartilage transplants is extended to a longer duration large animal study. In addition, several new methods of vitrification with better ice control will be screened in vitro and the two most effective methods will be tested in a large animal model in year 2. In Phase III, these studies will be extended to include human cartilage and tissue-engineered constructs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract): Origen Therapeutics is committed to developing pharmaceutical products in transgenic chickens.  In particular, Ongen's mission is to develop high affinity human antibodies. by creating chickens in which the endogenous heavy and light chain immunoglobulin (Ig) genes are 'knocked-out' and reconstituted with the human heavy and light chain Ig genes.  In evolutionary terms, birds have diverged from mammals and, therefore, the chicken produces high affinity antibodies against conserved mammalian antigens.  In addition, chickens produce a wide repertoire of high titer antibodies that possess high affinity and avidity.  By knocking out the endogenous lg loci and inserting the human loci in germline configuration, human polyclonal antibodies can be isolated from the chicken's egg.  By conventional techniques, human monoclonal antibodies can be produced from B-cells derived from chickens carrying inactivated endogenous Ig loci and human Ig loci in germline configuration.  These chickens will provide unique access to human polyclonal antibodies as therapeutic agents.  Human poylclonal antibodies are desirable because they bind to several epitopes on the target antigen, making them highly effective against complex antigens such as bacteria, fungi, viruses and toxins.  Currently, human polyclonal antibodies are used as anti-infectious agents against a variety of diseases but commercially available immunoglobulin preparations from human donors vary in their titer and effectiveness for pathogens, severely limiting their utilization. In spite of their attractiveness as therapeutics, high titer human antibodies from immunized sources are not available.Origen's technology for producing chickens carrying the human Ig repertoire is based on the use of chicken embryonic stem cells.  This application proposes to develop methods to specifically delete the chicken IgH and lgL chain genes.  The first aim is to develop robust methods for transfecting and selecting cES cells and to show germline transmission of a transgene.  The second aim is to target the J-segments of the heavy and light chain loci to prevent translation of the endogenous genes. Correctly targeted ES cells will be injected into recipient embryos to produce germline chimeras.  Heterozygous lgHKO and lgLKO birds will be produced and will be bred in phase Ill to birds carrying the human IgH and lgL genes.  At the completion of phase Ill, chickens producing human Ig in response to antigen will yield a novel class of therapeutic proteins providing highly effective passive immunity to patients suffering from acute diseases for which therapy is not currently available and chronic diseases that require specific, high titer polvclonal antibodies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ORINCON's proposed effort will address fundamental issues in the research and development of Level 2 fusion, namely, development of a solid mathematical foundation on which to build algorithms for situation refinement that includes organization andstructure. We believe that the fundamental approach to fusion in Level 1 - that is, detection, prediction, association, hypothesis generation, hypothesis management, and update - is applicable to Level 2. Examining the key elements of Level 1 fusion, wecan identify the parallel components of Level 2 fusion and evaluate the development in the underlying fundamental theory. As part of our Phase I work, we have laid the foundation by considering metrics that arise in the setting of discrete sets, thusbuilding a theoretical foundation that will provide a setting in which to develop and evaluate metrics, and the application of these metrics to the Level 2 problems of detection, prediction, and association. In Phase II, it becomes necessary to extend thisconcept of measure between two discrete sets to understanding the statistical features used throughout the Detection-Associate-Update steps by defining probability measures that occur naturally from the defined metrics. Accomplishing these objectives willprovide a basis for rapid development of future Level 2 fusion.",

Plug-and-play array processor cards are utilized within a COTS VME-based architecture to provide an extendible processing capability.

By adding processor cards, throughput can be scaled up to meet increasing requirements for additionaltargets, sensors, and revisit rates without modifications to the software system.  A dedicated fusion management process automatically distributes the processing load evenly across the configured processing nodes.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this Phase II application is to develop a sensitive quantitative biomarker of drug-induced neuronal degeneration, particularly associated with drugs of abuse. We have shown that during neuronal degeneration the neuronally localized protein MAP-tau is proteolytically cleaved (C-tau) in patients with head trauma and stroke. We have developed antibodies that specifically recognize C-tau. Employing C-tau ELISA and immunohistochemistry (IHC) Phase 1 studies demonstrate that after a neurotoxic dose of methamphetamine brain C-tau levels increase in a time dependent manner in the rat. Additional studies demonstrate for the first time, that MDMA ('ecstasy') is a neurotoxin utilizing our C-tau ELISA. Our quantitative C-tau studies indicate that MDMA neurotoxicity is only 3 percent of that seen after methamphetamine accounting for the inability of previous studies to demosnstrate MDMA neurotoxicity. The proposed studies will validate our C-tau neurotoxin biomarker by assessing the time course of neurotoxicity of three street drugs (MDMA, PMA and PCP dust']), an environmental neurotoxin (TMT) and a neurotoxicity 'Gold Standard'-kainic acid. Specific Aim 1-Product Development: Perform quality control studies and quality-controlled manufacturing of C-tau ELISA and IHC kits. Specific Aim 2-Product Utilization: Determine if C-tau reliably quantifies neurotoxicity caused by drugs of abuse and environmental neurotoxins. Neurotoxic doses of drugs of abuse (MDMA, PMA, PCP), an environmental neurotoxin (TMT) and kainic acid ('Gold Standard') will be administered and the time course of neurotoxicity quantified by ELISA and anatomically localized by C-tau IHC.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Our objective is to develop a sensitive biomarker for quantifying drug-induced neuronal degeneration.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse has indicated that \"improved methods are needed for identifying, assessing and quantifying the nature and extent of neurotoxicity\" of abused drugs. Currently, the primary method of identifying drug-induced neurotoxicity in animals is the selective silver stain method.  This method is histochemical and non-quantitative.  Our product will be both quantitative (ELISA) and more sensitive than available silver stain techniques for detecting drug-induced neurotoxicity employing immunohistochemistry.  There are several markets for our product (C-tau ELISA and C-tau immunohistochemistry).  Animal studies of neurotoxins, neurodegenerative diseases, head injury or stroke would be users of our C-tau technology.  In the year 2000 Medline indicates there were 4,254 studies published in these areas for an estimated annual market size of $4.2 million dollars.",

The new breath ammonia sensing method will be useful for diagnosis of infected patients, as well as for follow-up determinations of infectious status after therapy.\r Phase I results demonstrated 100 percent agreement with conventional\r 14C-labeled breath tests The research will optimize the clinical\r instrumentation, expand the scope of the Phase I clinical trial to a larger,\r more diverse patient set, and study test parameters that maximize the clinical\r diagnostic value of the test. This work will redisign the sensor and instrument\r as a logical and practical step to final product commercialization. Subsequent\r pre-market testing for commercialization will implement those instrument and\r test procedure and confirm their clinical efficacy.",

Building upon on our extensive experience in this area we propose tofabricate and test a 60 GHz polymer Mach-Zehnder modulator for the efficient optical distribution of millimeter waves. PWI's new electro-optic polymer material providing long-term 85 degrees C operation will be utilized. Two basic configurations will befabricated. The first one, designed for the very broadband operations from 10 GHz to 65 GHz, will have a DC half-wave voltage Vp in the order of 4 V. The second modification will be usable in several narrower bands, such as 40 to 44 GHz and 60 to 65 GHz,with DC Vp as low as 2 V. Finally, both types of the modulators will be hermetically packaged with input and output optical fibers, standard RF V-connectors and necessary matching circuits or/and proper terminations. These devices are expected to have amajor role in the remoting of millimeter waves in radar and communication applications.",

Visual displays which transform the time-domain signals into the frequency domain and which average over time are currentlyused for target detection and tracking.  However, averaging can mask important information about transients and other ocean acoustic events.  Further, sonar operators do not listen to VLF signals because current hardware and signal processing techniquesare not effective in this frequency range.Creare proposes to complete the development of a system to optimize VLF audio signals for human operator hearing.  The system will enable frequency translation and compensation so that the signal can be calibrated to the hearing response of a specificsonar operator and will enhance transients.  In addition, we will provide a user interface for optimally presenting VLF acoustic signals to sonar operators.During Phase I, we conclusively proved the feasibility of our innovation by developing a bench top system and demonstrating the system using synthetic and recorded acoustic signals.  In Phase II, we will complete the system development by optimizing thesystem using real-world data, performing testing with a sonar processing string, and preparing for sea trials.BENEFITS: This technology has the potential to significantly improve the ability of sonar operators to perform target detection and classif",

Recent advances in sensor technology at NASA laboratories have led to the development of very small mass spectrometer detectors as well as other instruments such as scanning electronic microscopes. However, the vacuum systems to support these sensors remain large, heavy, and power hungry. To meet this need, Creare proposes to build an extremely miniaturized vacuum system based on a very small turbomolecular pump. While smaller than a D-cell battery, the turbomolecular pump has performance that is well matched to the needs of miniature analytical instruments. Such a pump represents an order-of-magnitude reduction in mass and volume over the current state-of-the-art, as represented by another Creare designed and built turbomolecular pump. The new pump will form the heart of a complete vacuum system optimized to support analytical instruments in terrestrial applications and on spacecraft and planetary landers.",

The system can provide 250 W of cooling for four hours with a mass about six kilograms (roughly half the weight of the current thermal control module), and will also reduce the size of the suit's radiator by increasing the heat rejection temperature. After an EVA mission, the heat absorber is regenerated thermally and prepared for the next mission using waste heat from the spacecraft or habitat. In Phase I we will prove the feasibility of the heat absorber by (1) performing proof-of-concept tests that will demonstrate the viability of the approach and provide key design data, and (2) producing a conceptual design of an EVA suit cooler that shows the potential benefits of our approach.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The ultimate objective of the proposed project is to develop a practical onboard, inert-gas generation system for fuel tank inerting on commercial aircraft. The system would operate autonomously and provide inert gas on demand to the fuel tank ullage. The proposed system would be based upon Total Air Liquefaction for Oxygen and Nitrogen (TALON) technology presently being developed for the U.S. Air Force's C-17 aircraft. As compared with other approaches to onboard inert-gas generation (e.g. molecular sieves or semi-permeable membranes), TALON requires only 1/5 the bleed air and is about 1/2 the weight. In the proposed project, we will adapt and optimize the technology to meet the requirements for a commercial system. TALON also has the potential to provide nitrogen for fire suppression and oxygen to replenish emergency oxygen systems. The Phase I effort will focus on developing specifications for a commercial TALON system, producing a preliminary system design, identifying key technology elements that require further development, and a producing a preliminary palletized system design for a future Boeing 747 test. In Phase II, we will demonstrate key technology components and further define the palletized system test to be conducted during Phase III.",

We propose to develop a miniature Turbo-Brayton Power Unit (TBPU) using a closed-loop Brayton cycle to provide approximately 55 We at a sink temperature of 300 K. This TBPU promises to achieve a net thermal efficiency of 22% and have a mass of only 3.0 kg. The technical approach that enables high efficiency relies on unique micro-fabrication techniques that have been developed at Creare. These techniques have been used in long-life, vibration-free turbo-Brayton cryocoolers that have been successfully space flight qualified and tested. Here we plan to apply the basic technology to high temperature power generation. During Phase I, we proved the feasibility of the concept by demonstrating the operation of a prototypical turbomachine rotor in gas bearings at speeds in excess of the design speed. During Phase II, we will develop a prototype TBPU and test it at prototypical power levels and temperatures. The project team that will collaborate on this effort has extensive experience in the development of space-flight hardware incorporating high-speed turbomachines, high-performance recuperators, and precision gas film bearings.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         NASA has a pressing need for cost-effective and rugged mass spectrometers to detect hazardous gases on and around space vehicles during launch and flight. Recent advances in sensor technology have led to the development of very small detectors for mass spectrometers. However, the vacuum systems required to support these sensors remain large, heavy, and power hungry. An even greater problem is that commercially available high vacuum pumps cannot supply the required performance while withstanding the loads that would be experienced if the pumps were located on the launch vehicle or adjacent structures. Creare proposes to build and test a rugged, space-qualifiable vacuum system for use in a mass spectrometer. The vacuum system utilizes two innovative pump designs: a turbomolecular pump and a molecular drag pump. Both pumps employ a unique motor developed during Phase I specifically to provide high vibration tolerance. These pumps, which also rely on pump design technology developed in earlier NASA-sponsored projects, will be combined with a modified commercial diaphragm pump. Together, these pumps will comprise an integrated vacuum system that is optimized for use in a mass spectrometer operating in a harsh environment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The safety and efficiency of transportation will be enhanced by revolutionary systems that provide on-line health management of vehicle systems. Creare's Online Health Management (OHM) Toolkit facilitates the assembly of a such a system, through the creation of a distributed network-based data processing structure, which is completely described by semantic metadata. This approach enables the system to intelligently interpret diagnostic and prognostic information and to dynamically generate online reports for a wide range of users.The object-oriented paradigm employed by Creare's software, provides numerous advantages over current custom written systems, including reduced development time and cost, reduced learning curves, reduced bandwidth requirements through distributed processing, and increased data availability through data buffering and web-based report delivery.In Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by developing and testing prototype software. We accomplished this by building on Creare's previously developed, patented, and award-winning RBNB? middleware software. We augmented this enabling technology with an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring online health-monitoring systems.During Phase II of this project, we will complete development of the software to produce a commercial-grade package. We will then test the OHM tools by creating health-management systems for a number of demonstration applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Implantable micro machined electrode arrays, in the short term, are highly valuable research tools, and in the long run will have great impact on rehabilitation of patients with various disabilities. In a chronic system, an interconnect forms the critical link between the microelectrode to the external world through a percutaneous connector. University of Michigan has integrated their probes with miniature; flexible, multilead silicon ribbon interconnects. The critical issue is that the ribbons are inherently fragile being made from thinned down silicon, and are prone to breakage as a result of the mechanical stresses created by tissue contraction during the healing process. To overcome these limitations, a polyimide flex cable and a discrete connector are being investigated. Preliminary testing of polyimide cables has indicated that it is unsuitable for chronic implants. The proposed effort will focus on replacing polyimide ribbon cables and discrete connectors with an integrated rigid flex circuit made out of a class of biocompatible materials known as liquid crystal polymers (LCP) with a unique combination of properties. Compared to polyimides, LCPs absorb virtually no moisture and are not susceptible to hydrolysis. The ribbon cable and the connector are fabricated as one piece. Integrating the connector with the flex cable represents a major advancement compared to current hybrid approach. This eliminates one level of interconnections, and results in a much smaller percutaneous connector compared to current discrete connectors. Ultimately, the cable will be bonded to the neural probe with a planar flip-chip bond, eliminating the need for wire bonds. Elimination of wire bonds will reduce the profile height and eliminate a major reliability concern.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Objectives To determine the most effective mash recipe and optimal physical parameters for producing consistence, quality mulch pellets. In Phase I, we determined the general properties of a pellet that will make good mulch. The most critical operation is the actual milling of the mash into a pellet. It is a process involving pressure, heat and material consistency. The raw material that is pelletized is called a mash. The goal is to reduce straw volume by a factor of six to enable us to bagged, transported and spread the straw easily. Our challenge is producing densitized straw pellet that once hydrated contain long fibers to form a mulch matrix on the soil surface. To determine the most effective recipes for pellet ingredients of a dry applied mulch, a dry supplemented mulch and a hydro mulch. Each application shares one key objective, producing a mulch matrix on the soil surface with the maximum straw fiber content. However, each application has shuttle but significant differences that must be meet for the potential products to produce success. Dry applied mulch is limited by the equipment to spread the mulch. Our primary concerns are to produce a product that is flow able to prevent bridging in the spreader hoper. The dry supplemented mulch focus is a combination lawn repair mulch that will contain seed and fertilizer. Keeping the seed and fertilizer from segregating out of mulch prior to application will be a primary objective. The hydro mulch application must have pellets that hydrate quickly to prevent clogging or damage to the hydro-seeder pump and contain straw durable enough to be pump through the machine. To determine how to effectively use the mulch products for seed establishment and for soil erosion and sediment control. Seed establishment and erosion control are interrelated but yet very different. Our primary focus for seed establishment is to learn how well the straw mulch products will compensate for poor seed to soil contact and how well the mulch can aid in seed establishment under low moisture conditions. The erosion control work will evaluate the various mash combination for increase water infiltration and reduced soil runoff.",

The Dietary Research Monitoring System (DRMS) will utilize a Palm OS program for food intake recording which is then synced to the web and made available to the dietary professional for review or download. The DRMS also will allow the dietary professional to set dietary parameters to follow using a web interface. These dietary parameters will then be made available to the palm user to follow a recommended diet and receive feedback about compliance to that diet. In Phase I, a prototype of the DRMS program was developed. Feedback was obtained from dietary researchers and clinical nutritionists. The DRMS was evaluated in a small concurrent validity trial using a counterbalanced, crossover design. The results of Phase I showed that the DRMS produced correlations with food frequency questionnaires and 24 hr. dietary recall which were comparable to those found for food diary recording. For Phase II, the DRMS will be revamped and further developed based on the feedback obtained in Phase I. The resulting product will be evaluated by a pilot of potential end users for three days, and by a group of dietary professionals using the web interface. The product will then be evaluated in a randomly controlled trial comparing the DRMS to food diaries on: a) correlations and agreements with other dietary assessment measures (e.g. 24 hr. recall, food frequency questionnaire) and on the degree of compliance to a prescribed diet. One hundred and fifty subjects will be recruited and will monitor food intake for one week, then follow a prescribed diet for three weeks. The results of this Phase II project will be used to develop a commercial grade dietary assessment tool for use by various dietary professionals.",

The objective of this project is to develop an advanced artificial carotid artery flow phantom for use in developing MRI applications to identify patients at risk for transient ischemic attack or strokes. In Phase I, proof-of-concept was established. Phase II technical aims are selected to systematically expand the knowledge and experience base of key technologies: 1) lumen design, based on image data, 2) wall mechanics, with regional variation, 3) image morphology, including two distinct layers with fibrous cap lesion and 4) fluid motion with custom pulsatile flow pump and experimental results compared to hemodynamic simulations. Prototypes are constructed and evaluated in: academic, clinical and industrial environments to gauge commercial potential and identify key functional requirements for commercial development. Materials and preparations are optimized to obtain precision and stability of parameters on the order of 20 percent over 18 months. A comprehensive flow phantom will be critical for the development, validation and training of medical personnel on using state of the art MRI screening protocols for atherosclerotic carotid artery disease.",

Addition of new high voltage cathodes would result in a high energy, high power lithium battery for a wide variety of applications.The proposed Phase II program builds on the successful Phase I effort which demonstrated a highly stable, corrosion inhibiting polymer electrolyte with good ionic conducivity and cation transference.  The proposed Phase II effort will focus ontransitioning these materials into solid films with equivelent properties.  A laboratory effort together with molecular modeling will ensure that the new polymer films retain the desirable properties demonstrated by the Phase I materials.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Environmental regulations for air emission and waste disposal have created a need for paint removal methods that are both economically and environmentally acceptable. Furthermore, architectural surfaces painted prior to 1978 have lead paint that should be removed to meet U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) lead concentration standards. Improved paint removal techniques are needed because \"acceptable\" techniques are inadequate. Media blasting and abrasive techniques, for example, generate a large volume of debris and can damage architectural materials. Chemical strippers are labor intensive, messy, and may be toxic. Also, many stripped surfaces require additional preparation before repainting. However, pulses of light, a technology being developed by Phoenix Science & Technology, Inc. (PS&T;), removes paint without generating secondary waste and without damaging the surface. The technology also leaves behind a surface ready for repainting. Paint strippers using flashlamps and lasers are commercially available, but they are too expensive and impractical for removing paint from architectural surfaces. Phase I and subsequent internal research and development (R&D;) work at PS&T; demonstrated the feasibility of using this pulsed light source to meet lead concentration standards for architectural surfaces at high removal rates needed for commercialization.The proposed Phase II research project will continue the development of this photolytic paint removal process using PS&T;'s new lamp, with the potential to become a practical, low-cost paint stripper of architectural surfaces. The Phase II objectives are to: (1) determine optimum light pulse parameters for removing paints from architectural materials, (2) demonstrate an effluent capture system that meets air quality standards, (3) develop a robotic scanner to control the paint removal process, (4) develop a prototype depainter that meets HUD cleanliness standards for lead concentration, and (5) conduct a field test demonstration. The Phase II research project will be a sister program both to a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) program to develop the lamp technology needed for commercialization and a HUD Office of Healthy Homes program to develop a hand-held paint stripper to complement the large area paint stripper of this proposed Phase II research project. Together, the NIST, HUD, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency programs provide a comprehensive R&D; program for lead paint removal in homes. A manufacturer of detectors for measuring lead concentration in paint will support Phase II and is a potential partner for the commercialization of a paint stripper using PS&T;'s lamp.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Zebra mussels are a nonindigenous aquatic nuisance that now extends from the Great Lakes to the mouth of the Mississippi River. Zebra mussels clog intake pipes, screens, cooling systems, and so on, and are a serious problem. The Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act and Amendments mandate control of zebra mussel infestations. Chlorine effectively controls zebra mussels but produces disinfectant by-products, some of which are carcinogenic. Many alternative technologies have been attempted, but a viable means of effectively managing zebra mussels has not been demonstrated.Sparker technology is a potential nontoxic control method. Sparkers emit pressure pulses that can prevent the growth of new zebra mussels and clear away adult zebra mussels. However, the only commercial sparker is not widely used because of effectiveness questions, the need to replace electrodes frequently, and a high capital cost. Phoenix Science & Technology, Inc., has developed innovative sparker sources with high efficiency, proprietary electrodes, and acoustic reflectors. The objective of this Phase II project is to develop a new low-cost, long-lifetime sparker system with proven zebra mussel control capabilities. The feasibility of sparker control was demonstrated in Phase II. Field tests at two water intake pipes determined the pressure levels needed to control zebra mussels, and for the first time determined the control range of a sparker. In laboratory experiments, Phoenix Science & Technology, Inc., demonstrated how to increase electrode lifetime by a factor of four and designed a conceptual low-cost sparker.",

Phase I studies demonstrated that the zebrafish is a viable whole animal model for screening proteins and chemical compounds for anti-angiogenic effects. An enzyme assay was successfully developed to quantify vessel growth and a clear dose response was observed for several drugs. In Phase II research, the enzyme assay will be used to determine optimum assay conditions for protein drug testing, and then used to screen therapeutic drug candidates. Since comprehensive commercial drug screening programs rely on a number of confirmatory assays to assess drug specificity, Phase II research will also develop a family of vessel specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) based assays to complement the enzyme assay. Phase II research will also use the vessel specific mAb based markers to elucidate the mechanisms of angiogenesis. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: NOT AVAILABLE",

These tests take at least three years in mammalian models and only a very small number of compounds proceed to human testing. The cell culture system is currently used as an in vivo assay to evaluate molecular and regulatory effects within cells for drug discovery, however, cells lacking intact metabolic machinery often experience fewer toxic effects compared to animal models. This SBIR aims to develop the zebrafish as an inexpensive animal model for drug toxicity testing. Using zebrafish embryos, this SBIR will develop a comprehensive toxicity prescreening system comprised of a low density array and complementary visual assays to examine gene expression, cellular damage and morphological defects in response to drug treatment. The proposed zebrafish assays will help to reduce drug development costs by reducing the number of compounds entering preclinical mammalian and human testing.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: By providing a rapid and inexpensive toxicity prescreening system, the zebrafish assays will facilitate the drug development process for a variety of diseases, including cancer and heart disease.",

The zebrafish has a morphological and molecular basis of tissue and organ development that is similar to other vertebrates, including humans. Phase II research will automate the enzymatic assay developed in Phase I research for high throughput screening of small molecule compound libraries. The microplate-based zebrafish assay offers several compelling advantages, including assay time, drug delivery and drug dosage. Because zebrafish are inexpensive to breed and maintain, a statistically significant number of animals can be assayed. Phase II research will also develop complementary assays to assess effects of \"hit\" drugs on liver toxicity and whole animal development. Since comprehensive drug screening programs rely on a number of confirmatory assays to assess drug specificity, Phase II research will develop a family of complementary assays to fully characterize potential anti-angiogenic drugs. Analysis of complete living systems, before proceeding to complex living systems, such as the mouse, will streamline the drug development process and dramatically reduce costs.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Phylos is developing in vitro RNA-protein fusion technology for the rapid identification, selection and, engineering of proteins (including antibody mimics) with unique characteristics. As an alterative to antibodies or their fragments, we are investigating the targeting of small protein scaffolds that may be more suitable for pharmacological use. By selecting rare proteins from very large libraries (>10[13] members), we are able to select binders with a higher affinity (i.e. Kd<10[-9]) than those obtained using smaller libraries (e.g. phage display or in vivo monoclonal antibody selection). The lower dosing required by such high affinity binders should have clear pharmacological benefits. In addition, the smaller size of the binders (8.5 kD vs 150 kD for antibodies) may allow deeper penetration into tissues and tumors. The additional potential to \"evolve\" proteins by amplification under error-prone conditions, coupled with positive or negative selection pressure, provides additional flexibility in drug design. During Phase I of the program, a novel scaffold was identified and demonstrated for the generation of high-affinity binders to targets that are involved in angiogenesis. During Phase II of the program, we will use these binders to establish: (1) their activity in a variety of cell-based assays; (2) their anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activities in animal tumor models; and (3) optimize their pharmacological characteristics to identify a lead compound for use in the clinic.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: This technology will help to validate the use of a novel class of therapeutic drugs that will potentially compete and augment the use of monoclonal antibody therapy for cancer as well as many other diseases.   It will simultaneously speed the process of identifying high-affinity antigen binders as well as develop more clinically useful antibody mimic proteins that may have enhanced therapeutic qualities and lower production costs.",

A key initiative in NIAID programs for Healthy People 2010 is the development of tools for drug discovery and monitoring allergy and inflammation that are associated with infectious disease and chronic disabling conditions. Cytokines and chemokines are mediators (or surrogate markers) of these disease processes. In this program, a novel immunoglobulin-like scaffold has been developed as an antibody mimic. From a large random library consisting of 10313-10e14 distinct members, binding proteins were rapidly selected in vitro against key mediators by inflammatory or allergic processes. Antibody mimics to a minimum of 5 cytokine or chemokine targets were selected and will be further evaluated for performance characteristics such as affinity, specificity, epitope mapping, and ability to function on a solid phase surface. If needed, binding proteins can be improved by affinity maturation, and PCR mutagenesis. The resulting antibody-mimics will be used for the development of a prototype addressable protein chip for detection of these markers in a variety of experimental samples. This multiplex microarray will be validated for the detection and quantification of cytokines and/or chemokines in culture supernatants, biological fluids, cells, or tissues. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: This technology provides a powerful alternative to monoclonal antibodies and phage display mediated production of antibodies or fragments thereof. These unique protein binders will be incorporated into an addressable multiplex array for the high throughput analysis of samples from culture supernatants, biological fluids or cells for drug discovery and diagnostic applications.",

A common solution is to increase the capacity ofthese structures to carry loads by the introduction of additional tension-carrying materials such as Fiber Reinforced Plastic composites.  Efficient use of FRP composite to increase the strength of concrete components depends on the proper bonding betweenthe FRP plate and the rehabilitated structure.  It is therefore very important that delamination defects present at the interface or within the composite be detected in order to maintain the structural integrity of the reinforced concrete component.However, composites are very sophisticated materials with a complex structure and anisotropic material properties, which are very difficult to inspect using conventional Non Destructive Inspection/Evaluation (NDI/E) methods.  There is definite need for thedevelopment of new NDI/E technologies, which can address this complicated inspection problem.  In Phase I Physical Acoustics Corporation (PAC) tested and further developed a unique Acousto-Ultrasonic (AU) technology, which has potential as a tool for theinspection of these FRP composites.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new laser-induced Two-Photon Curing (LITPC) system for non-autoclave curing of polymers through illumination by infrared (IR) laser emission.  This system will be used by U.S.  Air Force personnel forthe fast repair of composite materials in field conditions.  In contrast with current curing technologies based on ultraviolet (UV) illumination, the proposed system will permit effective treatment of deep cracks and caverns.  The improved depth of curingwill be achieved through the utilization of the IR emission and specially developed chromophores added to the monomer compounds.  The selected monomers have low absorption for IR light while chromophores will have significantly enhanced two-photonabsorption in IR region.  In Phase I, POC successfully demonstrated the two-photon absorption technology for IR polymer curing, developed means for increasing the rate and volume of polymerization under a laser illumination, and tested chromophores withenhanced two-photon absorption in the IR spectrum.  In Phase II, POC will develop a prototype of a LITPC system for IR curing of polymers and will develop the technology for its use with selected compositions of light-curable monomers and effectivetwo-photon absorbing chromophores.",

In current solar panels, multilayer thin film antireflective coatings and cut-off filtersreject some visible wavelengths (mostly UV and violet-blue) while transmitting visible and near-IR, giving them a highly reflective, specular violet-blue spectral signature.  SCHOC is based on a new holographic coating technology, multiplexing subtractiveand additive reflection holographic structures.  SCHOC filters are flexible, environmentally stable, rugged, and nonspecular (diffuse).  The SCHOC itself is commercially attractive because of its low-cost material and fabrication, and its compatibilitywith state-of-the-art solar cell technology.  Phase I work involved a thorough design, theoretical analysis, and computer simulation of SCHOC filters, fabricating primary color filter modules, and demonstrating generation of color camouflaged PV cells.  InPhase II, POC will optimize the SCHOC filter design and filter components fabrication, and will develop a fully scalable SCHOC technology to produce the most efficient, lowest-cost colored PV solar panels, and making possible large scale production at lowcost for commercial photovoltaic applications.",

The snapshots are taken over a relatively wide field of view compared to current systems, allowing the test to be performed on a large area at once.  In Phase I, POC designed the system and demonstrated thefeasibility of the concept.  Phase II will refine the system design, and component development will lead to optimal integration of a laboratory prototype that will meet Army requirements.  The software for analyzing the fringes will be capable of yieldingquantitative stress values and qualitative characterizations of creep.

For this multicommunication scheme, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new compact Omnidirectional Robotic Beacon-eye (ORB) basedon a solid panoramic head, which will transfer an input area of plus/minus 15 degrees in elevation and 360 degrees in horizon to a conventional image field where it can be imaged through a microprojection lens to a receiver. In the reverse path, ORB can beused through the beamsplitter as a beacon with the same field-of-view. The microprojection lens has a telecentric arrangement in image space, and in case of power failure, ORB will serve as a retroreflector with the mirror at the beamsplitter facet. Thespecialized CMOS \"smart\" pixel receiver for ORB will be developed by Dust Incorporated in cooperation with Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center. Twenty ORB units will be manufactured in Phase II, integrated in a robotic platform, and tested under actualconditions.",

Current 3-D systems have very limited field-of-view or require intrusive headgear with head tracking to emulate look-around, and introduce inconsistencies between binocular convergence and eye accommodation. This project will develop a new class of 3-D displays based on proprietary liquid crystal scanner panels that time-sequentially project a large number of perspective images over a wide field-of-view into the view space in front of the display. The device will be a fully functioning full color, high resolution 3-D display system with large screen, large look-around field-of-view with many-perspective-image scanning at a flicker-free rate, using a high speed video projection system. The proposed 3-D system will be used for visualization of multidimensional scientific and medical data, for 3-D design and simulation, training and education of government and civilian personnel in a collaborative 3-D virtual environment, and for telepresence and teleoperation",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Army training and other activities that generate plumes of smoke or dust must not exceed EPA opacity limits.  However, current methods of measuring opacity rely on subjective \"trained observers\" which leads to disagreements about the accuracy of observer'sestimates.  To provide an accurate and objective means of measuring opacity, POC is proposing to continue Phase II development of their innovative Laser Opacity Retroreflector System (LORS).  LORS employs a low-cost, solid-state 35mW laser diode to directa beam through the plume which is then returned by inexpensive retroreflectors positioned up to 2 km away, beyond the plume.  Building on the success of recent proof-of-concept demonstrations, POC will further develop a portable LORS prototype that can betripod-mounted, attached to a vehicle, placed on a tower or carried aloft by a balloon or aircraft. The cylindrical retroreflectors eliminate the need for alignment.  Also, the eye-safe laser's wide beam eliminates the effects of air turbulence orinterference along the beam's path.  A LORS prototype will be completed and field-tested using fog oil and sand-based plumes with protocol based on EPA regulations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65592      Inertial fusion experiments require real-time, highly-accurate tracking of targets during each injection cycle.  Conditions within the chamber influence the targets flight, preventing accurate position predictions; however, the effective ignition reaction, using laser or ion beams, requires a targeting precision of 0.02 mm.  This project will develop a new and reliable target-tracking system that is capable of real-time tracking of the position of a high-speed (400 m/sec) target.  The tracking system will dynamically interact with the beam steering system to ensure effective and reliable ignition at every injection cycle.  In Phase I, a new Interferometric Target Tracking System was designed, developed, and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept.  Optics hardware and software were also developed and tested.  In Phase II, the proposed interferometric tracking system design will be optimized, and an engineering prototype will be assembled and integrated into the existing target injection system.  Comprehensive testing of the overall system will be performed under realistic conditions.                        Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  When fully developed, this technology should be the core element in future interferometric tracking systems for inertial fusion power stations.  Commercial applications include new test and measurement devices, machine vision for manufacturing, studies of high speed movements, and military and security applications.  Separate parts of the system should have use in industrial applications, projection profilometry, and optical shop testing",

The monolithic design of the SWIS keeps it small, lightweight, and low-cost, with high throughput and inherent environmental stability. SWIS spatio-spectral 3-D (2 spatial dimensions and 1 spectral dimension) images will have high spatial and spectral resolution provided by the 2-D detector array. Because of their compactness, many SWIS modules can easily be combined, expanding spectral sensing capability to cover the UV, visible, and IR bands. In Phase I, POC will initiate SWIS system design and analysis, and will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept by developing the components and integrating a laboratory proof-of-concept SWIS module. In Phase II, the system design will be optimized based on Phase I results for SWIS prototype development. When fully developed, the proposed SWIS sensor system will be compact, light, power efficient, and producible at low cost. Its high resolution hyperspectral imaging will cover a wide band, and its inherent environmental stability will make it well suited for airborne/spaceborne applications.",

Our concept would also allow the iodine \"fuel\" to be premixed with the singlet oxygen.  This may eliminate the present requirement for fine scale, molecular iodine mixing nozzles and injectors.  It also offers the opportunity for pulsed COILoperation since the atomic iodine can be produced on demand.  Using several analytical tools and experimental results developed in the Phase I program, we propose to design, build, test and install key modules on an existing Air Force Research LaboratoryCOIL device.

Detailed structure-property relationships will be established in order to provide a detailed understanding of the observed improvements in LDT, and as a guide for producingstill better materials.

(PSI) responds to the Air Force need to demonstrate the viability of inflatable optics deployed from picosatellites as well as the need to space validate the computer thermal, optical and mechanical models of their performance.  InPhase I, the PSI PicoSat Inflatable was designed to include on-orbit surface metrology during optic inflation pressure changes associated with passing through the solar terminator.  PSI identified commercial off the shelf components for low cost picosatconstruction.  Atomic oxygen induced transmission losses of candidate inflatable optical materials were tested to ensure the thin film polymer will not limit mission lifetime.  PSI performed calculations to assure achievement of design goals for opticalperformance and mission lifetime.  These design goals were applied to the allocation of the available space on the picosatellite.  In Phase II PSI proposes to use a masked inflatable optic to image a well characterized light source onto a CCD array.Analysis of these images enables the measurement of surface accuracy to within 20 microns, enabling us to verify static and dynamic models of the systems thermal and inflation properties.  An Aerospace picosat will be integrated with the PSI sub-assemblyduring a Phase III program.",

The degradation of the polymer will be enhanced through blending with a chemically biodegradable polymer.  The Phase I results demonstrate that weare able top form such blends, achieving a thin film extinction cross section of up to 6 m2/g in thin film form using this approach.   Calculations show that the conductivity needed to achieve the needed extinction coefficient is within the range of thepolymeric blends we propose.  In this proposal we demonstrate the theoretical basis by which we believe we can achieve the desired extinction cross section of 50-500 m2/g in thin film form and 4 m2/g for aerosolized material, illustrate the syntheticmethods that will be used to produce these materials and produce them with the desired forms, and describe the methods that will be used to characterize the material properties in terms of the extinction requirement.",

The computer software will generate the broadband transmission waveform, compute correlations between transmitted andreceived signals, determine the array shape, and perform diagnostic and control functions for the PMS.  The Phase II program plan presented in this proposal focuses on four aspects of system development:  covert operation, fault detection/tolerance,durability, and interface with other MLTA subsystems.  The proposed Phase II plan includes refinement of the PMS source design, construction of the shipboard subsystems, extensive durability and functional testing, and delivery of the prototype system tothe Navy.

Incorporation of the adhesive nanofibers into a fabric laminate for Chem-Bio Warfare (CBW) protection, using the Army Natick Soldier Center electrospun barrier membrane, is expected to yield a protectivegarment with high user acceptance. The bond strength can be tuned to ensure a failure mode below the tear strength of the CBW membrane.  During the proposed Phase II effort, PSI will optimize the fabrication of a laminated protective textile and enhancethe electrospun CBW barrier membrane strength by an order of magnitude using electrospinning methods developed by PSI.  The electrospun deposition process will be scaled-up to enable a 100 fold increase in production rate. The effort will exploit apartnership established during Phase I with Tex-Shield, the current prime fabric supplier of the Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) CBW protective overgarment.

Though the           confocal SLO has many valuable diagnostic capabilities, commercially available       devices are large, expensive and are impractical for hand-held applications. In      the Phase I program, PSI designed and demonstrated a confocal line scanning          laser imaging device, or LSLO, using a simpler, compact optical design,              standard low-cost components, and fewer moving parts that current SLO                instruments. Based on this work, the requirements for a compact prototype have       been specific that is similar in size and weight to commercial hand-held             digital video cameras. In phase II, we will develop and clinically test a            compact engineering prototype device for several clinical applications and           commercial development. This device will be suitable for fundus examination          under a wide variety of conditions, including screening and field and emergency      medical uses.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Physical Sciences, Inc. (PSI) has developed a novel method of producing thin film membranes for solar sails, based upon an adapted literature method. The PSI process has been used to make highly reflective membranes with an areal density of 0.125 g/m2. The Gossamer design for very lightweight solar sails that utilize photons for propulsion requires very large areas (>10,000 m2) and with low mass. The current solar sail concepts involve terrestrial fabrication of ultra-thin polymer films, seaming the films together, launching the sail into orbit, and deploying the sail without damaging these ultra-thin films. The present state-of-the-art polymer materials, and polymer thin film processing technologies are unlikely to permit tear and defect free solar sail launch and deployment without a true materials or processing breakthrough. The PSI process will rapidly produce large area polymeric membranes in space that meet the mechanical, areal density, space durability, cost, and propulsion requirements of the NASA solar sailing missions. The processes will be further developed during a Phase II effort for the in space fabrication of solar sails.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Laryngeal videoendoscopy combined with stroboscopy is now a mainstay for clinically assessing how the larynx functions to produce voice. Evaluation of the video imagery is currently limited to subjective visual judgments that can result in diminished reliability. A method enabling dimensional calibration of the images, and thus quantification of important vocal parameters, would greatly enhance the clinical and research capabilities of videoendoscopy with stroboscopy. Thus, the main goal of the proposed Phase II effort is to develop a laser-based projection system for dimensional calibration of laryngeal videoendoscopic images. The Phase I study just completed has clearly shown the feasibility of achieving this goal.   The focus will be to develop an optically based object sizing system for flexible transnasal as well as rigid transoral laryngoscopes. The Phase II effort will entail: (1) construction of clinical prototypes of the calibrated endoscopic instruments, and (2) extensive clinical testing of the instruments at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI).   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The market potential for a user-friendly calibration system customized for laryngeal videostroboscopy is estimated to be several hundred units in the U.S.  Similar systems for more general use endoscopy  of the upper airway (including larynx) have a potential worldwide market of up to several thousand units.  The latter market reflects the large number of otolaryngologists that use such scopes in routine clinical practice.",

The proposed source is based on proprietary MID-JET technology. This technology employs an electrode-less discharge contained by vortex flow, rather than a dielectric tube commonly used in traditional sources. MIDJET technology utilizing a temperature of 5000 C to produce1021 nitrogen atoms has been demonstrated. This is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that generated by currently available sources. It is particularly applicable to Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) systems, where it will allow both high growth rate and the elimination of the use of ammonia. The MIDJET will be adapted for use in a MOCVD reactor and a demonstration made of the system's ability to grow gallium nitride at a rate of at least 10 microns per hour. This project will develop a charge-free, high flux/fluence nitrogen atom beam for the growth of III-V nitride materials which can replace existing plasma-based tools. With higher growth rates of high quality material over larger areas, systems based on the MIDJET will have with application to the fabrication of high power/high temperature semiconductor devices and blue illumination sources (including those for flat panel displays).",

Pinnacle Pharmaceutical's platform technology is in the area of RNA metabolism. Phase I studies have validated a novel, proprietary, high-throughput screening assay for one such target. A screen of 3200 plant extracts led to the identification of seven active principles, none of which had previously been shown to affect the assay target. This Phase II application proposes (1) continued high-throughput screening of compound libraries (2) continued verification of the molecular mechanism of lead compounds, (3) structural modification of one lead identified in Phase I and other lead compounds identified in Phase II, (4) characterization of key compounds for their spectrum of activity against clinically relevant target microorganisms, (5) initiation of preclinical characterization of optimized inhibitors, including determining their chemical stability and toxicological properties. Successful completion of this Phase II research will lead to the identification of a new class of anti-infective agents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Methane to Aromatics on Mars (METAMARS) project will design and build a machine for converting methane produced by the Sabatier reaction into a low hydrogen content, low vapor pressure, high density, aromatic fuel. Its primary advantage is a factor of four reduction of hydrogen feedstock importation requirements for production of rocket fuel compared to the standard S/E process for an equivalent mass of fuel. In addition, since all oxygen produced by the Sabatier system comes from the carbon dioxide feed, by reducing the hydrogen in the fuel the METAMARS process will simultaneously improve the stoichiometry of the fuel/oxidizer combination and will reduce the power required by the process. The benzene fuel is also considerably denser than methane fuel. A final advantage of the METAMARS process is that it operates at low pressure, in contrast to synthesis reactions for other higher hydrocarbons. These advantages make the METAMARS process a prime technology to improve the applicability of the Sabatier process for small scale unmanned Mars missions, such as the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission, as well as a key technology for manned Mars missions.",

The design critera outlined in our Phase I report will be used in our Phase II effortto construct a more effective forward looking GPSAR system on a vehicular platform.  The system will make stepped frequency measurements over 500-4000MHz bandwidth and a 3m wide swath with look-ahead distances from 10-30 m. The system shall permit a 1kphrate of advance.  Key technical objectives include:1) Fabricate and test tapered slot antenna design.  If proven effective these small form-factor antennas will be assembled into a densly packed array capable of both horizontal and vertical polarizations.2) Construct dense array of transmit/receive antennas in a Mill's cross configuration using PSI developed archimedean spiral and tapered-slot antennas.   This will provide the GPSAR with the narrow vertical and azimuthal beamwidths prescribed by the PhaseI results.3) Implement spatial filtering and synthetic aperture techniques that exploit multiple looks at the target by the moving antenna array.4) Assess system performance by making measurements of mine and mine-like targets in variable soil tyes at U.S. Army test facilities",

To meetthese challenges, we will show the feasibility of (Phase I) and demonstrate (Phase II) an adaptive attitude control design approach that works during flight to autonomously identify the system dynamics affecting the control bandwidth, then design feedbackcontrol laws to achieve predefined performance and stability criteria.  Our technical approach is based on our Frequency Domain Expert (FDE) control algorithm, which has been demonstrated on the Space Station Freedom as part of the Middeck Active ControlExperiment (MACE-II).",

Rhenium isbeing used for nozzles and hot gas valve components because ofits high melting temperature and chemicalstability. However, the difficulty of forming rhenium and otherrefractory metals into complexshapes has limited their application in the past. PlasmaProcesses, Inc.has demonstrated rapid, low cost fabrication of refractory metalcomponents using Vacuum Plasma Spray processes. The techniqueinvolvesdepositing material onto a mandrel of the desired shape andsubsequentlyremoving the mandrel. A primary advantage over othertechniques is that net-shape forming of components significantlysimplifiesand reduces the cost of fabrication due to the high materialutilization andreduction of machining.  Analysis shows that a non-erodingnozzle will improve AMRAAM's ISP by 6 seconds.  In Phase I, arhenium nozzle was fabricated, composite wrapped, andsuccessfully hot fire tested in less than onemonth. The hot fire testing demonstrated the ability of net shapecomponents to meet stringent thermal and mechanical requirementswith zero erosion.Exploitation of these rapid processing techniques decreases thecost andmanufacturing time of rocket engine nozzle and hot gascomponents while boosting performance.BENEFITS: The results of the Phase I effort clearly demonstrate the ability to mateinnovative rapid manufacturing technologies with ref",

        "abstract": "Abstract         High temperature, corrosion resistant cartridge materials are needed for microgravity processing experiments. Tungsten and molybdenum have high melting temperatures and in general possess the required chemical inertness. To improve the mechanical properties of these materials, alloy additions such as rhenium are necessary. Recently, thin-walled, closed-end cartridges have been fabricated from elemental blends of molybdenum-rhenium powders. However high temperature heat treatments are necessary to alloy elemental blended powders. Problems with distortion, intermetallic formation and incomplete alloying have occurred. To overcome these problems, an innovative Plasma Alloying and Spheroidization (PAS) process is being developed to produce pre-alloyed molybdenum-rhenium and tungsten-rhenium powders. Benefits of the PAS process such as a two-order magnitude reduction in oxygen contamination, enhanced flow characteristics, ability to produce pre-alloyed refractory metal powders and the ability to reduce heat treatment processing time were demonstrated during Phase I. During Phase II, the PAS process will be optimized. The optimized PAS Mo-Re and W-Re powders will be used for the production of robust, high temperature QMI and GEDS cartridges for microgravity processing experiments.",

PlasmaSol has developed a means to maintain stable non-thermal plasma at atmospheric pressure and direct the plasma at a surface for decontamination purposes. Non-Thermal Plasmas (NTP) are ionized gases which are far from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and are characterized by having electron mean energies much higher than those of the ambient gas molecules. In these plasmas, it is possible to preferentially direct the electrical energy in order to produce highly energetic electrons without heating the ambient gas. This energy is utilized directly to excite, dissociate and ionize the gas via electron impact. PlasmaSol LLC has demonstrated in a laboratory setting the ability to break down a variety of organic compounds associated with hazardous waste using non-thermal plasma. In theory, at the microbial level, similar destruction should be expected for a variety of cellular organisms. These include but are not limited to bacteria, spores, etc. It is the intention of this project to determine the viability of non thermal plasma for use in the control of terrestrial microbial contamination associated with robotic space vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65129     The design of photonics integrated circuits, to be used in the next generation of sensors for national security applications, requires new and powerful modeling techniques that are fast and not overly taxing on computer memory.  This project will develop universal modeling tools for integrated photonics design using multi-scale physics simulation techniques.  New photonics software packages will be built which can model semiconductor laser devices and nonlinear optics processes in active and passive waveguides, including photonic bandgap crystals.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of using finite element and multi-resolution techniques for building a photonics modeling package.  Non-linear propagation and multiscale phenomena were addressed.  In Phase II, eight specific photonic devices will be modeled using finite element and multi-resolution techniques.  Code validation will be obtained by comparisons with detailed experimental measurements and iteration.             Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Universal design software for the photonics and telecommunications markets should revolutionize the way photonic devices are designed.  Such software should minimize the design cycle time, now bogged down by trial and error techniques and by the lack of firm simulation guidance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Phase I study demonstrated the feasibility that highly oriented PEEK and carbon-fiber-reinforced PEEK (CFR-PEEK) could be engineered as surface phosphonylated dental implants and these implants could be microtextured to enhance osseointegration. In the Phase I study, surface-phosphonylated and microtextured rods composed of solid-state oriented PEEK and CRF-PEEK were implanted transcortically in edentulous mandibles in goats and were assessed at 12 weeks for osseointegration. The results indicated (1) solid-state orientation of PEEK increased modulus; (2) phosphonylation of PEEK promoted osseointegration; and (3) osseointegration was further enhanced by surface microtexturing and immobilizing calcium to the phosphonylated PEEK surface. These results and additional studies at Poly-Med on PEEK clearly indicate several polymer engineering options can produce an optimum endosteal dental implant (EDI). Therefore, the options for the Phase II study will include solid-state orientation, fiber-ultradrawing, surface phosphonylation, fiber reinforcement, and self-reinforcement of PEEK. The ultimate goal for the Phase II study will be to engineer a novel cementless, EDI that will not have the biological and biomechanical deficiencies of metallic EDIs. Phase II objectives are consistent with this goal and will be to (1) use surface phosphonylation, solid-state orientation, and radiochemical sterilization, for optimized preparation of solid-state oriented PEEK, CFR-PEEK composites, and fiber self- reinforced PEEK composites; (2) design and construct three types of EDIs, implant in a dog model, quantitate biological responses intraorally, and compare to a commercial titanium EDI; (3) select one type of PEEK-based EDI for optimizing and finalizing plans for Phase III; and (4) identify a marketing partner for collaboration for planning and executing Phase III. Phase III efforts will address (1) final development and scale-up of the selected EDI and (2) conducting relevant studies to meet regulatory approval.",

Phase II objectives are to (1) optimize RC-S conditions to achieve device and spore strip sterility at a dose of less than or equal too 5 kGy, while attaining a practically CH2O-free gas environment in the package; (2) develop the RC-S process in concert with package development for broad application to several forms of devices comprising absorbable and non-absorbable radiation-sensitive parts; and (3) conduct studies to support installation of self standing (or shared) contract RC-S facilities in Phase III. Phase II plans entail (1) optimizing the RC-S process for use with absorbable sutures and allied devices at less then or equal too 5 kGy toward selecting a practical combination of Celcon weights and device holders; (2) extending RC-S applications to absorbable orthopedic devices; (3) validating the RC-S process for typical commercial and selected experimental sutures, orthopedic, and related products; and (4) developing plans with a radiation technology partner to construct a self-standing (or shared) RC- S facility for precise delivery of less than or equal too 5 kGy radiation to prepackaged products in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Phase II project is to complete development of a new Rolling Joint Prosthetic Leg comprising a Rolling Joint (Free-Flow) Foot and Ankle and the Rolling Joint Prosthetic Knee. Original design of both prostheses is based on a Rolling Joint Technology, recently developed by the applicants. The Rolling Joint Foot and Ankle was commercialized in October of 1999. Major efforts during the Phase I of the current study were developed to design, manufacture and testing of the new Rolling Joint Knee. As results of the Phase I study showed, development of Rolling Joint Prosthetic Leg has merit to be continued. Development and testing of the Rolling Joint Knee will be completed during the Phase II proposed. Additional research will be conducted to verify the hypothesis that patients with trans-femoral amputations will benefit from aan assembly of both Rolling Joint Units in a Rolling Joint Leg. New methodology for individual tuning of critical parameters of prostheses will be developed. It will provide more normal, less painful locomotion in a lower limb amputee and increase number of patients to be managed prosthetically. The specific aims of the Phase II project. Complete a development of a new Knee unit prototype with compliant tibial component; conduct a comparative mechanical tests and biomechanical gait study with 20 trans-femoral amputees to verify the hypothesis that a new prosthetic device with the proposed mechanical outcome improves a trans-femoral amputee gait by normalizing \"stump-socket\" interface during stance phase of gait. Long term objectives of the proposed research are to develop a functional, reliable and economical prosthetic modular system. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Potential commercial application is the creation of a product line of Rolling Joint Feet and Knees. The RJ Leg will enhance performance of transfemoral amputees without increasing the cost, thus providing a highly competitive product in the field of prosthetic rehabilitation.",

Utilizing only a single measurement, the proposed method will provide a standardized percent HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin A1c) result using a handheld instrument. The method requires only a one-step application of a fingerstick whole blood sample and takes less than 10 minutes. Preliminary data obtained with whole blood samples containing normal (4.3 - 7.0 percent) and high (> 7percent) HbA1c levels demonstrate the potential of the proposed method. All current point-of-care instruments for HbA1c require more than one step to operate. We believe our proposed method is eligible to receive a LIA waiver status due to its one-step operation. HbA1c measurement can provide diabetic patients and their healthcare providers an overview of their success in meeting long-term goals for controlling their blood glucose level.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Instrumentation development is planned for the real-time measurement of crystal size, shape and volume fraction to improve the quality of crystalline products. This would help reduce losses, rework and downtime and eventually, shorten the development cycle of crystalline products. The data generated by the above instrument would help predict supersaturation in the crystallization processes in real-time. Since crystallization is the most widely used separation and purification technique for drugs, this project would improve quality control and help reduce energy and material consumption in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The field-prototype instrument for crystal size and shape will be based on the concepts proven in Phase I. Additionally, it will provide real-time temperature and volume fraction measurements. This prototype will be tested in industrial crystallizers.To accomplish the above, a team of engineers with appropriate skills in digital electronics, opto-mechanics and software has been brought together. They will collaborate with the university researchers, pharmaceutical engineers and the computational experts. The project plan includes periodic reviews that are structured to stimulate interactions within the R&D; team.If proven successful in field tests, the prototype will be readily turned into a product that would be marketed by a major instrument supplier to the pharmaceutical industry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Nanosat technology will require commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) integrated circuits (ICs) to meet the performance requirements. Single event latchup (SEL) triggered by energetic ions in the space environment is a reliability concern. Thinning the Si substrate material below the active region in the CMOS structure raises the threshold linear energy transfer (LET) threshold for energetic ions to trigger SEL because the thinner substrate region produces less charge when the ion penetrates. With a higher LET threshold, there are fewer ions capable of triggering SEL, rendering the IC more radiation-tolerant with respect to SEL. The innovation of this approach is that substrate thinning will be applied to unhardened ICs which are purchased from commercial vendors and post-processed (thinned and possibly ion implanted) and packaged as a radiation-tolerant product. This will enable use of a large class of high-performance ICs that would not otherwise be acceptable for use in the space radiation environment. The significance of this innovation is that it will reduce susceptibility of COTS microelectronics to SEL and enable their use in future NASA missions. In Phase I we will assess the feasibility of the approach and in Phase II we will demonstrate prototypes.",

The U.S. segment uses an expendable, activated charcoal bed (22.7 kg charcoal), a high temperature catalytic oxidizer assembly and a postsorbent LiOh bed. The Russian system uses an expendable activated carbon canister (1.3 kg) followed by two regenerative activated charcoal beds (16 kg apiece, 7.4 kg charcoal in each) and a room temperature CO oxidizer. PCI is proposing to develop a novel, regenerable adsorber using zeolites/adsorbents coated on Microlith? substrates to replace the activated charcoal beds. Phase I results indicate the potential to reduce 15 kg charcoal weight to less than 2 kg of adsorbent with a proportionate reduction in size and a reduction in housing weight. The Phase II proposes to develop and optimize a resistively heated, thermo-vacuum Microlith? adsorber to be used as a simple, lightweight and cost effective system that aims to demonstrate safe and reliable operation with minimal maintenance, electrical power and crew-time requirements. A prototype will be delivered to NASA upon Phase II conclusion.",

The development of effective treatment for hypertension is critical to controlling costs of this disease which has the largest negative impact on the U.S. economy in loss of productive years. Anti-hypertensive drugs have a large window of therapeutic options, including significant variation in dosages, medications, and combinations of therapies used. The objective of the Phase II project is to continue development of the software platform, GeneRx, which incorporates pharmacogenetics and nonlinear adaptive algorithms toward optimizing anti-hypertension therapy on a patient specific basis. Genetic data for each patient will be acquired by genotyping DNA from the blood samples, and scored as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present or absent in key hypertension-related genes. GeneRx will take a patient's individual genetic, demographic, and environmental variables and predict lickely efficacy of a hypertension medication. In Phase I, the basic feasibility of a predictive algorithm for predicting patient response for the ACE inhibitor class of hypertension drugs was established. The Phase II project will use patient information and blood samples from both archival and ongoing hypertension studies to predict the effectiveness of other classes of hypertension medications, including calcium channel blockers, dieuretics, and beta blockers. The commercial application of this project is in the area of hypertension therapy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The replacement of millimeter-wave traveling wave tube by solid-state power amplifiers has been recognized as a very important goal for some time.  Solid-state power amplifiers provide the substantial benefits of elimination of high voltage supplies,reduction in size and weight, and generally improved reliability, especially for airborne microwave systems.  However, the demand for high power at millimeter-wave frequencies are steadily increasing for today's military and commercial systems such asMILSTAR, SATCOM, GBS and LMDS. The limitation of output power of present MMICs can be partially overcome by combining several of them offers low loss, good amplitude and phase balance, and high power handling capability.  Combining approaches can beseparated into two groups: those, which can combine two devices at a time and those that can combine the output of N devices in one step.  On one hand, the losses of binary structure degrade the combining efficiency and on the other hand, the n-waycombining structures are designed to combine the output of N-devices in one step.  This scheme has the potential of higher combining efficiency.  We are proposing the development of SATCOM amplifiers using Gysel Combiner and MILSTAR amplifier using Radialcombiner.  The choice is dictated by the availability of the present day MMICs.",

Research assessing the efficacy of court-mandated domestic violence treatment programs has yielded disappointing results. A major problem with mandated treatment is that it tends to be standardized and 'one-size-fits-all,' neglecting individual differences in motivation level and readiness to change. We propose to individualize services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model (TTM) based intervention tailored to individual stage of readiness to end the violence. In Phase I the objective was to develop a stage-based computer-administered multimedia expert system intervention and self-help manual designed to be administered as an adjunct to traditional batterer treatment. In Phase II, the objective is to complete development of the intervention materials, translate them into Spanish, and assess their efficacy in a randomized clinical trial. English- and Spanish-speaking domestic violence treatment clients will be randomly assigned at treatment intake to the experimental (n=350) or control condition (n=350). Efficacy will be assessed by comparing the intervention and control groups on number of batterer treatment sessions attended, partner reports of recidivism, re-arrests for domestic assault, and several secondary outcome measures.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A National Research Council report on preventing reading disabilities or developmental dyslexia in young children (Snow, Bums, & Griffin, 1998) concludes that the majority of reading problems could be prevented by reducing the number of children who enter school inadequately prepared in at least three critical, and potentially remediable domains: Phonological processing; knowledge about print; and vocabulary. These combined domains are not assessed adequately by existing measures of reading readiness, and intervention activities that facilitate their development are absent from preschool curricula. This Phase I application has two specific aims. The first is to evaluate the feasibility of a test that will assess the three critical domains. Test development will feature state-of-the-art procedures for item selection and evaluation, with particular sensitivity to children at risk for reading failure due to poverty, limited English proficiency, and parental history of reading failure. An initial evaluation of the psychometric properties of the test will be completed by administering it to 300 3- to 5-year-old children. The second aim is to produce and complete an initial evaluation of prototypic intervention activities for each domain. The initial evaluation will be accomplished in a pilot study of 30 3- to 5-year-old children at-risk for reading failure. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The test and training activities to be produced should be widely used in preschool settings including Head Start centers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A major goal of HIV-1 research is the development of nontoxic agents that target novel stages of the viral replicative cycle, such as viral entry. New agents are needed both to combat the growing incidence of HIV-1 strains that are broadly resistant to existing antiretroviral medications and to lessen the considerable toxicities associated with current therapies. In addition, adequate control of HIV-1 replication generally requires uninterrupted, combination use of three or more drugs, mandating that new antiviral agents be produced as cost-effectively as possible in order to maximize patient access. CD4-IgG2 is a novel, tetravalent antibody-like molecule that incorporates four copies of the virus binding domains of human CD4, which is the primary receptor for HIV-1. CD4-IgG2 binds to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 with nanomoIar affinity, thereby preventing attachment of HIV-1 to target cells and viral entry. CD4-IgG2 has demonstrated potent activity against primary HIV-1 isolates in extensive preclinical testing and more recently in Phase I/II human clinical trials. CD4-IgG2 is the only HIV-1 attachment inhibitor in advanced clinical development and thus represents a new class of antiviral agent. CD4-IgG2 is potently synergistic when used in combination with agents that block other stages of viral entry, such as the gp41 fusion inhibitor T-20 and coreceptor-targeting agents. This result suggests that combinations of entry inhibitors could emerge as an important new treatment paradigm. CD4-IgG2 is currently produced via conventional cell culture methods. However, transgenic technology provides an unsurpassed method for low-cost, high-volume manufacture of complex biopharmaceuticals. The Phase I study demonstrated that biologically active CD4-IgG2 can be expressed at high levels in the milk of transgenic animals, using mice as a model system. The overall goal of the Phase II project is to produce CD4-IgG2 in the milk of transgenic dairy animals, and to determine the therapeutic potential of transgenic CD4-IgG2 in both the best available preclinical models of HIV-1 infection and in human clinical testing. Success in the project would represent an important milestone for the development both of a new class of anti-HIV-1 therapy and of transgenic technology.",

The commercialization campaign involves collaboration with JSF OS providers and coordination with the JSF team.Comprehensive platforms such as JSF have a system-of-systems infrastructure composed of varying middleware functional and performance requirements.  For this reason a Middleware Framework made up of middleware component and tool products is proposed forJSF and other targeted applications.  The framework design itself is planned to be open, extensible and scalable to allow code reuse, support future capabilities, and support varying hardware and communication configurations.The products planned to be developed throughout the course of the proposed Phase II effort are middleware components resulting from working with Lockheed Martin to develop middleware components for the ICP.  These components comprise an MPI Library,Canonical Layer, a Messaging Instrumentation Suite, and a Trust Framework.BENEFITS: Distributed Real-time Embedded (DRE) systems are increasingly being used in mission-critical domains such as online financial trading, distributed process control, submarine information",

The initial Phase I SBIR proposal, with aims to synthesize and evaluate novel agents that would be activated within a hypoxic tumor environment, provided strong evidence that PX-478 is selectively activated by hypoxic cancer cells and is an inhibitor of increased HIF-1 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by the cells. The objective of this Phase II SBIR proposal is to move PX-478 through more extensive pre-clinical development. The specific aims of the proposal are: 1) to synthesize three salt preparations of PX-478 and to evaluate the physical chemical properties and properties and pharmacokinetics of each preparation to select a candidate for formulation and bioavailability studies; 2) to expand animal model evaluation of PX-478 and develop a biological endpoint assay based upon inhibition of HIF/VEGF expression; 3) to perform GLP toxicological evaluation of PX-478 in rodent and dog species. The conclusion of this Phase II SBIR will see ProIX Pharmaceuticals move PX-478 through complete pre-clinical development to IND submission to the FDA. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: One in every five deaths in the US is doe to cancer.  The overall cancer drug market exceeds $2 billion in the USA.  There is a significant need to identify novel and selective small molecule-based cancer therapies.  This proposal seeks to undertake full preclinical development of a novel anti HIF/hypoxic bystander, PX-478, and initiate a Phase I clinical trial for its eventual use as a therapy against cancer.",

Optimization is derived from the \"scene\" - the clutter and target environmentin  which the radar is operating - using the instantaneous data from the radar to construct clutter maps and signal tracks that drive the optimization process.  Waveforms are selected via a multi-step scheduler from a library that includes conventional andnovel (multiwaveform) types sufficient to provide the required wide variety of ambiguity functions. The  main thrust of the project is to develop a prototyping simulator that will permit estimation of the performance of the system in a variety of clutterand target scenarios. The resultant techniques are expected to have a wide range of applications, for example in airborne ground surveillance radars, in maritime surveillance, and in space-based radars.  A commercialization plan is proposed that willassess the relevance of the system to existing and emerging radar systems in consultation with the potential customer base and with radar system suppliers.

This project will develop a rugged, low-cost thermal neutron detection technology using a large array of straw detector elements, each with a very thin converter coating, that can be produced and assembled efficiently and economically.  The small diameter of individual straws will permit good spatial resolution and adaptable size and configuration.  Assembling the straws into modules, and using modern integrated circuit technology, will allow the straws to be read out individually in parallel, thereby permitting extremely high count rates.  In Phase I, single straw neutron detectors of 10 cm and   1 m length, as well as a 50-straw module, were successfully constructed and shown to demonstrate stable operation.  Experimental testing of gamma ray discrimination, neutron efficiency, aging effects, and spatial resolution was performed with excellent results, including longitudinal resolution approaching 5 mm in a 1 m detector and sensitivity exceeding that of commonly used He3 detectors.  In Phase II, cost effective methods for base materials production will be developed.  A rugged module housing and two electronics readout systems will be designed, constructed, and evaluated.  Testing at neutron facilities will be performed to demonstrate the functionality of the detector for various applications, and the results of this testing will be used to refine and produce a fully functional detector with accompanying electronics.              Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The proposed neutron detector should have application in neutron scattering facilities at government and university nuclear research laboratories in the U.S. and abroad.  Enhanced neutron scattering capabilities should enable progress in materials characterization and structural biology, resulting in advancements in biotechnology, the aviation and automobile industries, and superconductivity research, among other fields.  A rugged, low-cost neutron detector also should provide more practical and lower cost technology for neutron survey applications",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):All clinical nuclear medicine imaging is done exclusively with crystal detector systems, which impose many limitations in both cost and technical performance. In 140 keV imaging, the Nal/PMT camera, the workhorse of nuclear medicine, is extremely bulky, costly, and limited in both count rate and spatial resolution. In 511 keV PET imaging, the need for exotic high Z crystals results in high cost and limited solid angle. Xenon at a density of 0.55 g/cm3 can produce a 10-fold energy resolution improvement over Nal and LSO and a time resolution comparable to LSO. Based on previous work, we propose a high pressure xenon cylindrical pulse ionization detector (20-50 mm diameter) having a pressure containing shell composed of a very low density high strength fiber composite. Through use of this composite, interaction losses with the walls of the vessel are lowered to negligible levels. Also, a highly innovative readout technique has been proposed and evaluated in which the tube interior is read out through effectively transparent walls. Pilot analytical and experimental studies have proven that a general purpose detector element can be achieved capable of both 140 keV and 511 keV imaging and having excellent 3D spatial resolution on the order of 1 mm. Experimental studies have also shown that, through use of light signals produced by both the primary interaction process and stimulated emission near the electron collection point at the anode, energy resolution approaching amplifier noise limits is possible. \r \r Thus energy resolution can be markedly improved relative to any room temperature crystal. The density of xenon employed is about 6-fold less than Nal but still affords efficient detection of 140 keV in a suitably thin detector. For 511 keV detection, the multiple interaction vertices that occur in xenon are adequately spread out among distinct tubes in an absorbing array and primary scintillation light provides coincidence time resolution of 1 ns. Thus, the proposed detector element configured in appropriate arrays can offer greatly improved performance in both of the major nuclear medicine imaging arenas. In Phase II, arrays of full sized detector elements will be developed, constructed and evaluated to predict imaging characteristics that can be achieved in very important SPECT and PET techniques.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last few years an extraordinary emphasis has been placed on the design and use of PET cameras for small animal studies, for example, to aid in the development of human gene therapies by imaging transgenic animals such as mice. Although, such techniques have an extraordinary potential for both clinical and basic biomedical science applications, its full realization is severely hampered by the expense, complexity and physical limitation of crystal detectors widely used in today's cameras. In particular, crystals are costly and very difficult to segment to the desired 1 mm level. Furthermore, depth of interaction error in the 1 cm or greater crystal depth required causes severe degradation of off-axis resolution. This project seeks to develop enhanced high resolution PET through the highly novelapproach of the lead walled straw (LWS). In Phase I, feasibility of application of this high energy physics spin off technology has been proven, and in fact it has been demonstrated that considerably enhanced imaging characteristics can be achieved. A 2 mm LWS modular unit has been developed which has produced 1.0 mm FWHM axial spatial resolution. When utilized in ring arrays, such a module will produce a reconstructed volumetric spatial resolution of less than 2 ul, which is a factor of 8 improvements compared to the best commercial camera. Furthermore axial sensitive field of view can be readily extended to as large as 20-40 cm, and very high sensitivity can be achieved at modest cost. In Phase II, a promising modular detector design will be fully implemented and a custom electronics readout system will be developed, facilitating low-cost construction. A small animal PET camera will then be developed with performance that substantially exceeds that of current commercial systems for murine and other small animal imaging. In Phase III, this camera will be developed into a commercial product, which is expected to substantially aid in this important research field.",

The goal is to develop a multidimensional, modular, self-report questionnaire that evaluates the course and outcome of psychiatric treatment. The Multidimensional Assessment of Symptoms and Psychosocial Functioning (MASP) is designed to assess symptom severity of the most commonly diagnosed DSM-IV Axis I disorders, as well as psychosocial functioning and quality of life. Items on the scale are based directly on DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, and the scale is organized for immediate availability of information. The scale's modular structure lends itself to selective subscale administration for ongoing treatment outcome assessment. Phase I successfully attained the following goals: (1) demonstration of the understandability of the MASP?s items; (2) demonstration of the feasibility of using the MASP in clinical settings; (3) establishment of the internal consistency and test-retest reliability of all MASP subscales, (4) demonstration of the discriminant and convergent validity of the MASP subscales, (5) demonstration of the reliability and validity of the MASP items, and (6) support for the factor structure of the scale. The final, and most important, steps in the development of the MASP is to demonstrate that the instrument is sensitive to clinical change, and to establish MASP subscale scores corresponding to different severity ranges.",

To achieve these goals, the following two objectives will be addressed in Phase II.  First, we will develop software tools to support an eventbased approach to assessing and diagnosing direct leadership performance.  Second, we will conduct a detailed study to investigate the validity and usability of the resulting performance measures. The application of a principled approach to performancemeasurement should result in significant improvements in the diagnostic utility and construct validity of direct leadership measures.  The resulting products should have broad potential for the assessment and development of leadership talent.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Puresyn, Inc. has developed purification processes for recombinant adeno-associated virus gene therapy vectors utilizing its proprietary chromatographic resin, PolyFlo. In Phase I, two tandem chromatography processes were developed: heparin affinity and PolyFlo and tandem PolyFlo in two different modes. Each process resulted in product of high purity and recovery that exceeds gradient centrifugation processes. We demonstrated each process removes significant amounts of host and viral contaminants. We are seeking Phase II funding to concentrate on AAV production to include large-scale purification up to 5 x 10e14 particles per run without compromising purity, yield or biological activity. We will refine and expand our current processes to assure they are applicable to AAV serotypes 1, 2 and 5. We will also address the significant problem of AAV aggregation. Finally, we will conduct an in vivo mouse study to determine the correlation between purity, biological activity and safety through the evaluation of immune and histopathological responses to the vector. Results of this research will have immediate impact for those engaged in the use of recombinant AAV vectors for gene delivery because it will allow the large-scale development of AAV vectors, It will have positive commercialization implications for PoIyFlo and Puresyn, Inc.",

The genera of the designs are Busemann inward turning flowfields.  Streamline traces are carved from these flowfields to form the compression surfaces of a broad variety of practical inlet geometries.These surfaces are then truncated to provide an optimum balance between component weight and inlet compression efficiency.  Many of the inlets have highly swept leading edges, which minimizes their drag and corresponding heat loads and enhances starting.A major part of the effort will be the development and demonstration of novel techniques to enable starting.  These include; 1) arrays of interactive jets produced by a gas generator to aerodynamically deflect a portion of the inlet flow and severalinnovative techniques for venting flow.  Documentation of the inlet performance and demonstration of the starting devices will be a major part of the SBIR effort.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The most widely used solid-state laser technology is based on Nd-doped laser materials, providing output in the 1050-1060-nm wavelength region.  Alternative materials can provide other wavelengths more suited for eyesafe ladar, but systems using thesematerials have shown substantial limitations in either or both power output and efficiency.  For focal-plane-array (FPA)-based ladar (also referred to as flash ladar) systems in particular, the need to generate a combination of high energies and shortpulses eliminates many solid-state lasers from consideration.  In the work proposed here, we take advantage of recent developments in solid-state laser design, new laser materials (Tm:YLF and Ho-doped YLF or YAG), and improved high-power semiconductorlasers to develop an efficient, compact, high-power laser system in the 2050-2100-nm wavelength region.  Our innovation is the combination of: 1) our side-pumped, conduction-cooled, multi-pass slab design proven to operate with a variety of laser crystals,2) the laser crystals Tm:YLF, Ho:YLF and Ho:YAG, and 3) high-power, efficient diode lasers based on aluminum-free active layers.  We anticipate the demonstration of a Tm:YLF-pumped, Q-switched Ho-doped eyesafe laser with >100-mJ output energy,approximately 10-ns output pulsewidth, and a maximum operating pulse rate of 60 Hz at the completion of this program.",

The laser will be injection-seeded using a single-frequency, cw diode-pumped, 10-mW Nd:YLF laser developed by Q-Peak. The system will feature intracavity tripling to convert the near-IR output of the Q-switched Nd:YLF laser into the UV. Due to the use of both diode pumping and intracavity conversion, the electrical efficiency of the proposed source is substantially higher than that of lasers now used in the wind profiling lidar systems. High repetition rates (5  10 kHz) allows the possibility of reducing the data acquisition time. Single-frequency, short pulses (20-30 nsec) allows for a high accuracy and high range resolution.",

The single-bit, delta-sigma architecture offers high purity (-150 dBc/Hz), low in-band spurious content (100 dB SFDR) signals on one integrated circuit realized in IBM's SiGe BiCMOS process.  In addition,this sophisticated DDS will support beamforming operations (i.e., time delay, phase shift, amplitude weighting).  Its small size, low power dissipation, and low cost make the Delta-Sigma DDS attractive for integration into advanced T/R modules.  Under theproposed Phase II Base effort, Q-DOT will develop a monolithic Delta-Sigma DAC IC realized with SiGe BiCMOS technology.  In the Phase II Option, the Delta-Sigma DAC integrated IC will be integrated with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components to form astored-waveform, Delta-Sigma DDS Module.

This proposal involves the development of all three primary components of the complete system:instrumentation, winching, and lifting platforms.  We will add a fast response, three-dimensional hot-film sensor to our Phase I instrument to make wind vector measurements to scales smaller than 1 cm. A specialized winch system will be designed andconstructed to allow for optimal operation with both kite and blimp platforms in a highly portable, self-contained unit. Kites and tethered balloons will be employed as the lifting platforms for the system. Existing single line parafoil kites will bemodified to limit the maximum tension they produce in high winds, and commercial advertising balloons will be employed in light wind conditions to allow system operation under a wide range of wind speeds. The entire atmospheric measurement system will betested at various stages of its development at White Sands Missile Range, or another suitable site, and measurement results will be compared with existing instruments and remote sensors available at that site.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The measurement of ozone is one of the most critical atmospheric chemistry measurements made in the study of the Earth's atmosphere. The depletion of stratospheric ozone and the photochemical production of tropospheric ozone from pollutants are two major areas of study which demand accurate, high-resolution ozone data. QEI Technologies, Inc. proposes to develop a next-generation ultraviolet absorption photometer for mounting on small aerial platforms. The compact, single-beam photometer will be based on earlier designs developed by the Principal Investigator for use on tethered and sounding balloons. The new design, in keeping with the philosophy of the earlier single-beam designs, will offer performance matching heavier, more expensive double-beam instruments while greatly reducing size and power consumption. In contrast with electrochemical sondes, the ultraviolet technique offers far greater precision as well as immunity to interferences from virtually all other atmospheric species at typical concentrations. Phase I work will involve constructing one prototype to demonstrate a range of design improvements over earlier versions. Phase II will involve design refinement and extensive field tests with several instruments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will produce a set of completed and commercially viable intelligent tutoring systems for chemistry education, building upon a rule-based, model-tracing, cognitive modeling tutor prototype for chemical equation balancing. Teachers, students, parents and administrators state that existing chemistry education software does not satisfy their need for truly interactive and on-demand computer instruction. Current approaches are rigid and linear, offering only a limited number of fixed and statically scripted problems. They do not deal with the individual student's own work in any meaningful or intelligent way. By simulating reasoning using chemical principles rather than compiling a database of problems and answers, artificial intelligence methods can provide a route to overcoming these serious fundamental limitations. Although the technology proffered by Quantum Simulations, Inc. is technology that will assist all students, those students of average or marginal performance will benefit the most. Creating tutoring systems that can function as guides and not just as graders of student work is an important step in realizing the full value of computers in education. The proposed work takes a significant step in this direction. Moreover, the technology has been designed in a general way such that it can be applied to other educational topics beyond chemistry and can work together in a synergistic, value-added fashion with other tools and curricula in a multi-resource learning environment. Quantum Simulations, Inc., customers are driven by strong end user needs and include textbook publishers, software provides, and distance learning companies",

Existing tactical radars, such as the TPQ-37 and MPQ-64, are highly sensitive search and track radarswhose basic operational parameters are ideally suited for weather surveillance applications. During Phase I, we plan to work with engineers from the radar manufacturer to design one or more weather surveillance modes for the TPQ-37 and MPQ-64. A customradar signal processor will be designed to extract reflectivity and Doppler data from the analog output of the radars. This data will be merged with antenna scanning, time stamp and geo-location information to accurately display the output data in worldcoordinates. Recurring and non-recurring costs to modify the radars for weather surveillance applications will be determined. The pulse-to-pulse scanning agility of these radars makes them especially powerful tools for the study of rapidly developingconvective weather systems that are poorly characterized by conventional PPI-scanning weather radars.BENEFITS: Commercial applications include modification of existing and new TPQ-37 and MPQ-64 radars for tactical and civilian weather surveillanceapplications. The radar processor developed through this SBIR can be readily modified for use with other civilian weather radars.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In this Phase I SBIR proposal, we describe an integrated airborne multi-frequency radar system for aircraft icing avoidance. The primary thrust of our research will be the development of designs for low-cost millimeter-wave radars suitable for detection of backscatter from liquid water clouds at ranges in excess of 10 km. Existing radars that have been used for these studies are expensive one-of-a-kind research instruments with designs that are unsuitable for general aviation, where cost will be a primary consideration. By working cooperatively with manufacturers of microwave and millimeter-wave subsystems, we plan to develop a suite of radars for airborne and icing detection that will reduce the cost by a factor of five or more for prototype systems, and by a factor of up to 100 for production units. Practical airborne icing potential detection cannot be achieved without a major cost reduction of millimeter-wave radar systems. By using solid-state transmitters, integrated or monolithic low-noise receivers and IF circuits, and novel antenna concepts, and advanced signal processing techniques, we are confident that low cost systems can be developed for both airborne and ground-based applications.",

(QEI) proposes to develop and characterize an ultrastable microwave radiometer operating at L-band and capable of providing a measurement of sea surface salinity to an accuracy of 0.1-0.1 parts per thousand (ppt). This level of accuracy is necessary to produce useful oceanic data relating to ocean circulation, and requires a radiometer measurement stability precision in the range of 0.05-0.10 K. Based on the performance of existing and similar spaceborne radiometers such as SSM/I and AMSU, we believe that this performance can be achieved. To demonstrate, this study will focus on laboratory development of high precision/high stability front-end architectures and integration of low noise amplifiers, switches, and noise diodes into low loss antenna feeds. In addition, the precision calibration apparatus necessary for long term testing of the radiometer stability will be identified and designed.",

For a diverse set of patients, we have achieved an accuracy of 10 ml for endocardial volume, 4% for ejection fraction, and ,2.0 mm for border position. Our processes operates in 4 min. In Phase II we propose to continue research and development to move our ABD technology closer to clinical user. Our first specific aim is to reduce the amount of manual input required even further. Our second aim is to develop a prototype system suitable for clinical evaluation. Our third aim is to perform a pilot trial to evaluate the performance of our ABD process, as a preparation for a more formal, multi-center clinical trial planned for Phase III. The proposed research is important because quantitative 3D echo provides greater accuracy and reproducibility and more comprehensive information on cardiac status than currently available imaging techniques. The significant advantages of 3D echo are not currently available for clinical practice because it is impractical without automation.",

The limited information available suggests that delayed healing in microgravity is related to impairedangiogenesis, immune dysfunction and alterations in cell migration. These are also primary factors contributing to non-healing, chronic wounds on earth. The focus of this Phase I was to determine if Light-Emitting Diode (LED) technology used for biostimulation can be enhanced to deliver doses of near-infrared (IR) light deep into the brain, at the level of the pituitary gland, to stimulate neuronal processes, including cytochrome c oxidase activity and neuronal regeneration. This may have multiple benefits as countermeasures to neurologic injury from microgravity and radiation in long-term space flight, such as the ability to restore neuroendocrine function.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"Operating a vector-component magnetic sensor in motion with high sensitivity is challenging.  Compensation of motion noise is classically achieved by configuring the sensor as a magnetic gradiometer and taking advantage of the fact that the earth'smagnetic field is spatially nearly uniform.  Quantum Magnetics, working with the Navy and IBM Research, has developed a unique sensor configuration, the Realtime Tracking Gradiometer (RTG) that solves the dynamic range challenges particularly well.Operating such a sensor in a low-cost Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) adds still more technical challenge: that of negating locally-generated magnetic interference without compromising the sensor's motion noise immunity or its responsivity to detectiontargets.  In Phase I, we demonstrated the efficacy of two complementary approaches to mitigate local interference.  One, developed by Quantum, modifies the RTG hardware, and another, developed by the Navy's Coastal System Center, adapts the noisecompensation algorithm.  In the Phase II Base effort, we will provide the Navy with a version of the RTG specifically designed and ready for AUV integration.  We will support the Navy in sensor integration into an AUV and demonstration at sea.BENEFITS: Thetechnology developed under this program will add to the Navy's organic MCM capability.  It can also be adapted for use in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for locating underground facilities.  Private-sec",

The proposed Phase II project seeks to take this technology to the next step- a commercial product running on actual turbine engines providing new and useful information to turbine operators. In Phase II, technical goals are to optimize the sensor antenna, construct a 35.0 GHz radar subsystem, and built an antenna fitting that will mount the sensor to a turbine engine through existing holes in gas turbines. Finally, a hardened beta prototype sensor will be built and tested on a General Electric F404 turbofan engine. The end result of Phase II will be a tested beta prototype that Radatec will market to industrial and government users.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         During the Phase I effort of the Vibration Assisted Clam Harvesting effort, it was shown that the employment of vibrations for mechanical clam harvesting is environmental sound, economically feasible, less stressing on workers, and addresses pressing industry needs. The overall goal of the Phase II effort is to advance the development of the vibratory approach by developing the necessary supporting technologies to have a completely integrated system capable of harvesting clams on a commercial scale. The availability of such a system may have far reaching industry impacts and may cause changes in farming techniques to capitalize on this revolutionary capability. With these goals in mind, the technical objectives focus both on hardware development and farming procedures. Technical objectives include the development of a variable vibratory control system to account for varying substrate conditions, means for tracking the harvester through the clam bed when the system is out of visual sight (underwater) and an overall control scheme to synchronize the action of the harvesting head with the mobility platform (watercraft or walk-behind unit). This program will develop a vibratory system that is adaptable to different soil conditions by providing feedback and controlling both the amplitude and frequency of the vibrations. The overall control scheme must incorporate, not only these vibratory factors, but also the adaptability in forward motion of the harvester and control of the `ground pressure' of the harvester. The objective is to optimize the interaction of these physical parameters of the harvester over a wide variety of conditions to increase the system functionality, utility and appeal. The ultimate objective of this effort is the commercialization of capability. Our commercialization strategy is designed to allow for the development of a modular system to accommodate a variety of harvesting conditions with appeal to different-sized clam farming operations. An initial design developed in Phase I consisting of vibrating tines will serve as the baseline for further development. This design meets our requirements for a generalized harvesting head design that is scalable to different sized farming operations and can be incorporated into different mobility platforms. In addition to determining the physical requirements of the harvester, research will explore changes in planting techniques. Clams are currently planted in a manner to support manual harvesting. With the availability of an acceptable automated harvester, planting techniques and clam-bed configurations may be changed to optimize harvesting operations. This Phase II effort will explore changes to farming techniques that support automated harvesting. During the Phase II program, economic and environmental aspects of the vibratory harvester will be explored. This will include collection of operating and life-cycle-cost and productivity data. This information will be collected during an extended operational demonstration to assess the impact of the approach on both the industry and environment.",

These methods will be incorporated into an ISO-9000-based quality system suitable for use by small poultry marketing alliances in producing, processing, and marketing free-range and pastured poultry in a retail supermarket environment. The quality system can establish a structure for process quality within alliances, providing a means for standardizing key practices and increasing the capacity of the participants to contribute consistent quality products. Alliances of small units can offer the feel of a larger organization, opening up higher volume market opportunities, as they are better able to compete. The objectives of the project, including technical questions it will address, are as follows: 1. Refine the whole and cut-up free-range/pastured poultry product formats in bulk and pre-packaged form. What is an economical method of cutting up chickens on a small-volume basis? What is the best weight of bird to maximize the cut up yield (bone-in and boneless)? What processing practices are required to ensure consistent appearance of cut parts (conformance to standard cutting of parts) for conventional marketing? What is the impact of cutting and pre-packaging on product shelf life? Food safety protection? What packaging method(s) strike the best balance between affordability and consumer appeal? 2. Identify best practices for small free-range/pastured poultry production and processing. What production factors seem to have the greatest influence on the final appearance and eating experience of the finished product (e.g. breed, feed, forage materials, size and age at slaughter)? What are the production standards to be established for these factors? 3. Develop a Good Natured Family Farms Quality System for free-range/pastured poultry production, processing, and retailing patterned after its QSVP system for beef. Which elements of the existing QSVP system must be customized for poultry (e.g. livestock production records, product identification and traceability during processing and retailing, etc)? What systems will be implemented? What process may be used to achieve certification recognition by the USDA? By alternate third parties?",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Conical scanning LIDAR systems and laser ranging systems that measure atmospheric backscatter, clouds, aerosols, winds, trace species, and sub-surface ocean layers require ruggedized construction and easy alignment. We are proposing to reduce the complexity and alignment chores by building five telescope objectives into one large shared aperture using holographic volume multiplexing techniques similar to those used in some holographic data storage systems. The holographic objectives will then be stationary with five simultaneous look angles that may be turned on and off with a smaller coaxial out going beam scanner or a separate laser in each channel. This simple scheme can eliminate all moving parts which simplifies alignment while providing a more rugged and transportable system. The addition of a holographic aberration correction plate is now possible in a static position near the detector. This small HOE gets illuminated by incoming LIDAR signals and outputs a collimated wave which is easily focused by a simple doublet to a near diffraction limited spot. The benefit is that the field of view can be greatly reduced, thereby reducing background noise levels. The additional diffractive surface squares the wavelength dependant filtering function provided by diffractive optics, thereby further reducing out of band noise.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal presents an innovative design for a traffic information and collision avoidance system for general aviation aircraft. While there are many ongoing programs to improve situational awareness, the majority of the research is aimed at commercial aviation and high end users, and will require expensive technological solutions. General aviation has the same needs -- to improve situational awareness and therefore improve safety, but most general aviation aircraft owners cannot afford the types of solutions that are being evaluated for commercial aviation. There is a need to provide GA pilots with traffic information, cost-effectively, at the nation's 5,134 public use airports. In this proposal we present a low-cost solution that can provide the vast majority of GA users with the ability to identify and locate other traffic in the terminal area. Depending on whether the aircraft is equipped with a moving map display or only a VHF radio, the service will either show the location of proximate transponder equipped aircraft on the map display or will provide aural alerting only. This proposal combines Rannoch's pioneering work in aircraft tracking technology with Potomac Airfield's pioneering work with VHF pilot alerting to provide a complete solution with two levels of service.",

A Dry Heat system is developed to permit very rapid thawing (under 10 minutes) instead of the 40 to 60minutes now necessary using an inconvenient, large water bath.  This heating system is also used to warm IV fluids in surgery. Rapid thawing is crucial to meeting the military needs for thawed and deglycerolized blood in emergencies.  A new blood bag withits protective shipping container is developed that will have less than 3% breakage, compared to current 20% to 50% breakage in military use.The Phase I effort demonstrated feasibility and the proposed Phase II research will develop, fabricate, test, demonstrate, and begin field testing of pre-production prototypes of the Dry Heat system and the new frozen blood bag.

We will expand upon the progress we have made in Phase I, where we are adapting proprietary modeling techniques intended for catalysis and materials science problems to the challenges of predicting acute oral toxicity and of providingreliability estimates for every prediction.  In Phase II, we will develop \"living\" predictive models for several toxicological endpoints: the software will automatically generate improved models when fed new data.  The software is designed to takeadvantage of an anticipated wealth of new toxicity data expected from various sources, including high throughput screening and microarray techniques.  We will also develop modules necessary for managing and analyzing large quantities of toxicological data.This software will be accessible both from within ITAS and as a standalone application.",

Working with Eagle-Picher Technologies, RBC succeeded in its Phase I program in solving the two major causes of early failure in silver/zinc batteries, by incorporating innovative electrode and separator components. Capacity fade on cycling was appreciably reduced translating to higher average working energy density and specific energy. Polyolefin based microporous separators were stable in KOH electrolyte giving wet-life superior to a cellophane containing laminate. Cells could be assembled in the charged state, not requiring a formation step, which is an advantage in terms of mission preparation. The proposed Phase II program will build upon the successful results of the Phase I demonstration to complete development to the point where RBC would design, assemble and deliver to NASA a higher performance silver/zinc battery for a specific NASA application. In Phase II RBC will work with Eagle-Picher Technologies and Advanced Membrane Systems, Inc. in order to complete optimization of separator and electrolyte for maximum service life. The technology will then be scaled into 40Ah, 17V batteries for the Extravehicular Mobility Unit-Primary Life Support System.",

In littoral environments close to shore-based commercial and other radio frequencyemissions, the uplink frequency bands are subject to in-band radio frequency interference (RFI).  Such RFI can result in a significant probability of failure of an ADAR tactic requiring a certain minimum number, say 8 or 4, of clear channels.Several possible and feasible approaches have the potential of offering substantially improved performance for the uplink communications in the assigned VHF bands for ADAR tactics.  Current systems for satellite data links, wireless mobile telephony,terrestrial digital TV transmission, and generally digital data links, successfully deploy a variety of more sophisticated modulation and coding strategies.  Under this Phase II effort we propose to develop, prototype, and test of some promising modulationand coding techniques analyzed in Phase I.BENEFITS: The proposed improvements can have significant performance advantages for the current ADAR system: Not only will an increase in immunity to RFI interference be possible, but the efficiency and lower BER can also allow for trade-offs in channelassignments and use of buoy power.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Defense against chemical weapons is a critical DOD requirement. An effective defense requires the development of unique clothing systems that are a physical barrier to toxic vapors, liquids, and aerosols. In addition, the protective material must bepermeable to water to reduce incapacitating heat stress, and must be lightweight, flexible, and cost effective. Materials currently in use by DOD are effective barriers to chemical and biological weapons but they are not permeable to water vapor andproduce dangerous heat stress. TDA Research, Inc. is developing a breathable protective clothing material from polymerizable surfactants and butyl rubber. The surfactants form a continuous porous structure with angstrom scale pores large enough to allowwater vapor to pass while preventing chemical agents from reaching the wearer.In Phase I, we demonstrated the ability to produced a breathable rubber material from a self-assembled nanocomposite that consisted of polymerizable surfactants and butyl rubber. To our knowledge, this work represents the first successful demonstration ofa liquid crystalline phase that contains butyl rubber, or any high molecular weight linear polymer and a polymerizable surfactant. The development of a breathable clothing material for chemical agent protection would be a very significant benefit to the armed forces and civilian defense. Currently, individuals wearing a protective suit are very limited in the amount of physicalactivity they can endure without the use of a cooling vest or external air supply. The commercial application of this technology would be to manufacture clothing materials for garments produced for the armed forces and civilian defense as a means toprotect against chemical warfare or terrorism. Additionally there will be markets for personal protection in industries that handle or produce dangerous chemicals, as well as applications in the separations industry.",

Most research has been performed with gaseous fuels, sodemonstrating rapid deflagration-to-detonation using storable,liquid hydrocarbon fuels is essential to the successfuldevelopment and widespread use of this engine.  Unfortunately,liquid fuels require atomization, which introduces the challengeof detonating a liquid droplet spray.  Recent research shows thatdroplet Sauter-mean diameters as small as 3 mm may be required.These droplets will track with the flow in the engine, but arenot expected to penetrate very far.  Thus, fuel distributionduring atomization will be needed to reduce post-mixingenhancement.  New atomization technologies are required toproduce these small droplets and still meet the Navy'srequirements of high temperature operability (500 F), lowpressure drop (< 50 psid), high-speed on off pulsing with zero-drip closure and high fuel flow rates (0.5 lbm/s).  Even thoughsuch an atomizer has never been built, there are no fundamentalproblems that prevent it.  Therefore, TDA Research, teamed withthe University of Colorado-Boulder, proposed to develop a novelhigh-speed, high-resolution atomization system to meet theserequirements.BENEFITS: The atomizer developed by this research will be applicable in a wide range of propulsion and power generation applications, including aircraft and stationar",

Current non-slip treatments are heavy and degrade theaerodynamic performance of the aircraft because of their highprofile.  Therefore, they are used only sparsely.  During thePhase I project TDA Research Inc.

In Phase II TDA will optimize the formulation of thelow-profile non-skid topcoat developed in Phase I, will scale upits production, and pursue its commercialization.BENEFITS: TDA's material will have immediate application as a coating for the vertical takeoff/landing aircraft V22.  Other military and commercial airlines could benefit from a lightweight, low profileanti-slip coating.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The area/volume power densities of packaged electronics will continue to increase until the method of heat rejection is the sole performance limiter. Perhaps the most reliable long-life cooling systems finding applications in space are passive; namely, heat pipes. Unfortunately, the balance between capillary pressure and viscous resistance limits the performance of these devices. Overall fluxes of 100W/cm^2 may be achievable with such systems, but local fluxes will never exceed pool boiling critical heat flux values that peak at approximately 100W/cm^2, but are normally much less. The novel thermal cycle proposed here circumvents this limitation. The cycle is passive yet generates pressure gradients substantially larger (up to 100-fold) than capillary systems. Such pressure differentials may be exploited to achieve very high forced-convection phase-change cooling rates (i.e. flow boiling/spray cooling) in coupled evaporators by direct contact with MCMs, or by more traditional flow-through designs. Heat fluxes obtained in this manner exceed those of capillary systems and are O(500W/cm^2). In Phase I we will demonstrate the high heat flux capability of the cycle exceeding 100W/cm^2 from simulated 2-D surfaces or 3-D MCM stacks. In Phase II we will produce an optimized design for high flux space electronics (i.e. satellite) heat rejection.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65455    Gasification technologies convert coal into synthesis gas feed streams that can be used in the production of a wide variety of chemicals.  However, the coal-derived synthesis gas contains a myriad of trace contaminants that may poison the catalysts used in the downstream manufacturing processes.  Removal of these contaminants is critical for the successful utilization of coal as a feedstock in the synthesis of chemicals.  This project will develop a sorbent system that can reduce the concentration of the three major catalyst poisons (arsenic, iron carbonyl, and nickel carbonyl) to less than parts-per-billion levels in the coal-derived synthesis gas.  Phase I demonstrated the technical feasibility of using an expendable, arsenic absorbent for high temperature syngas clean-up.  The developed sorbent had very high activity and arsenic absorption capacity, and was capable of absorbing about 40% arsenic on a weight basis.  Phase II will continue to improve sorbent performance and scale-up its production.  A prototype reactor will be developed, and the best sorbent will be used for demonstration in the presence of other impurities of the coal-deprived syngas (H2S, COS, NH3 and HC1).              Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Conversion of coal-derived synthesis gas into chemical intermediates and transportation fuels is an emerging market.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Recently, NASA has increased its emphasis on reducing the cost of reaching low Earth orbit. The goal is to reduce the cost from the current $10,000 per pound of payload to $100 per pound. Studies indicate that a key technology requirement is a single stage to orbit (SSTO) using rocket based combined cycle (RBCC) engine. In the third stage of a RBCC launch, an air breathing vehicle will travel at speeds from Mach 5 to Mach 10 prior to exiting the atmosphere. Under these conditions, the vehicle requires cooling in excess of that available through sensible heating of the fuel. Although this heating can be supplied by endothermic cracking of the fuel prior to combustion, the temperatures required to achieve necessary rates are very high. High temperatures reduce the allowable stress in the heat exchanger, increasing its weight and reducing its efficiency. In this Phase I SBIR, TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to test chemical initiators that greatly accelerate the rate of thermal cracking reactions, allowing them to proceed at lower temperatures. We will then carry out a systems analysis which will model the behavior of the fuel passing through the test section, allowing us to identify the most effective operating conditions.",

Stringent environmental regulations limit the shipment of hazardous wastes like HCl, and the disposal of HCl by neutralization is costly.  Although processes exist for converting waste HCl back to Cl2, they become too expensive when the concentration of the waste HCl is low.  This project will develop improvements to a new process that uses a regenerable sorbent to recover HCl from waste streams.  Previous work showed that the new process has the potential to reduce the cost of Cl2 to less than half of the cost of fresh chlorine.  In Phase I, improved sorbents were produced and tested under process conditions.  Multiple cycle tests showed that the improved sorbent has the potential to convert waste HCl to chlorine over a long lifetime at approximately half the cost of buying fresh chlorine.  In Phase II, sorbents will be made by techniques representative of commercial production, and then screened to identify the best composition.  Key design features will be evaluated.             Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  HCl waste streams (from vinyl chlorine monomer, other chlorinated organics, and titanium dioxide manufacturing) could be reclaimed to produce approximately 850,000 tons of Cl2 per year.  The new conversion process should consume only 13% of the electrical energy required for electrolytic production of fresh chlorine (an 87% reduction) and also reduce fuel/steam consumption by 65%.",

Homogeneous rhodium catalysts are used in the production of lower aldehydes because they are the most active and selective catalysts for this reaction.  Distillation is used to separate the catalyst from the lower aldehydes.  However, for the higher aldehydes, their higher boiling points make distillation impossible; therefore, the rhodium catalysts cannot be separated and inefficient cobalt catalysts must be used.  To eliminate the need to separate the rhodium catalyst by distallation, this project will develop solvent mixtures to separate the rhodium catalysts from the aldehyde product.  The thermomorphic solution will allow for easy catalyst recycle, resulting in dramatic energy and cost reductions for higher aldehyde production.  In Phase I, the thermomorphic solvent mixtures were tested, resulting in high selectivity and low catalyst losses.  An economic analysis, comparing the new rhodium-based process to the current cobalt-based system showed more than 30% saving in feedstock and energy costs.  Phase II will optimize conditions for the thermomorphic catalyst system, and a continuous bench scale reactor will be designed, built, and tested for long-term performance.

A system that utilizes vacuum distillation and catalytic oxidation (VPCAR) is being developed for Mars missions. A key step in the VPCAR process is the gas phase oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen and water without forming NOX. In Phase I TDA Research Inc. developed catalysts for this reaction. Our approach to the problem was centered on the development of a bifunctional catalyst, which could separate adsorbed oxygen and nitrogen atoms, thereby reducing NOX formation. In Phase I we identified a catalyst formulation, which converted 100% of the ammonia feed at temperatures where very low concentrations of NOX were produced. In Phase II, we will refine the catalyst composition, test both ammonia and hydrocarbon oxidation reactions in a pilot scale reactor, and then, in work carried out at Hamilton Sundstrand, we will test the reactor on a full-scale unit.",

Because the furnaces needed to make components are expensive, and furnaces of the size needed to make airframe components simply do not exist, we need a way to join these composites together to make complex and large shapes. TDA proposes to address this problem by using welding equipment to join C/SiC and SiC/SiC composites. In Phase I, we demonstrated the ability to join these composites by producing a reaction-bonded silicon carbide in joints with commercial Gas Transferred Arc Welders at rates of 5 seconds/inch with strengths greater than the parts to be joined. In Phase II, we will optimize this welding/brazing process to produce prototypes including a 10 inch x 10 inch C/SiC joined composite. We will also produce a 1 inch x 6 inch C/SiC composite joined with a silicon alloy to produce a higher temperature capability joint. In addition to aerospace structures these technology will be commercialized in current markets for monolithic silicon carbide.",

In addition, expensive tail gas treatment processes are needed to bring large Claus plants under environmental compliance.  This project will develop a novel catalyst that provides a higher conversion of sulfur compounds in the Claus reactor.  The use of this catalyst would decrease emissions of sulfur compounds in Claus processes, significantly reducing the amount of investment and operating costs needed for gas processors to meet their emissions requirements.  Phase I will design, synthesize, and screen a series of catalysts, and the most promising will be thoroughly investigated to determine its activity and durability.  A detailed process and economic analysis will be undertaken to determine the benefits of the technology to the gas industry.    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The increased recovery efficiency from the use of the new catalyst should benefit existing Claus plants and eliminate the need to install costly tail gas clean up technology.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The current expendable emergency oxygen generation systems in the Portable Life Support System (PLSS) are lightweight and work well. However, they could generate very high weight penalties when the number and duration of missions (and/or emergencies) are high (as in lunar or Martian explorations). TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes a light-weight emergency unit using a novel regenerable sorbent. In the unit, the sorbent releases oxygen while removing CO2 and H2O. The unit also rejects the heat of absorption to space and maintains the desired degree of cooling. Following the EVA, the sorbent is thermally regenerated with oxygen. A simple oven is the only regeneration equipment required, greatly reducing the weight of the regeneration equipment. In addition, the same unit can also be used for O2 supply and CO2/H2O removal in normal EVAs (i.e., non-emergency cases). The innovation addresses the needs for future long-term microgravity and planetary exploration requirements. Decreased weight reduces the launch costs, easy maintenance increases crew time available for research activities, and an efficient design reduces the logistic train support for replaceable units and spares. In Phase I, TDA will measure the oxygen storage capacity and CO2/H2O loading of the sorbent under simulated PLSS conditions, and carry out 20 full cycles. We will then design the components of the emergency unit and the regeneration system. We will estimate the weight and power requirements.",

However, the coal-derived synthesis gas contains a myriad of trace contaminants that cannot be released to the environment if the coal-derived syngas is burned to generate power.  The removal of these contaminants is critical for the widespread and environmentally-friendly utilization of coal.  Also, in chemical production, the contaminants may poison the catalysts used in the downstream manufacturing processes.  This project will develop a sorbent-based system that can reduce the concentration of the trace metal contaminants (i.e., mercury, arsenic, selenium, cadmium) to less than parts per billion levels in the coal-derived synthesis gas.  Phase I will prepare and test sorbent formulations that can effectively remove mercury under simulated conditions.  An engineering analysis will be performed to identify the feasibility of integrating the sorbent system into state-of-the-art coal gasification processes and assess the economics of the proposed application.

The operating costs of CDT are roughly half those of reverse osmosis, the current system of choice. Obtaining a reliable and plentiful supply of clean water is becoming a worldwide problem. From this work, society (both in the U.S. and worldwide) will benefit from an inexpensive method of producing potable water from large existing reserves of brackish (saline) water.

These results suggest that neuroprotective pharmaceuticals are one of the most unique, yet important and commercially viable applications of fullerenes to date.  Although it shows great promise as a neuroprotectant drug useful in treating ailments such as ALS and Parkinson's disease for which better treatments are desperately needed, the derivatized fullerene compounds are currently too expensive and cannot be produced in sufficient quantities for clinical testing or to treat patients. During Phase I, we developed several new techniques that allow efficient production of a carboxyfullerene pharmaceutical compound. With continued development, we anticipate that by the completion of the project, it will be possible to economically manufacture enough of the fullerene- based neuroprotectant for clinical trials to begin.",

The goal of this SBIR project is to integrate a six degree offreedom motion base into TACOM's CAVE environment.  As part of this Phase II effort, several research issues must be addressed.  First a scene compensation strategy based on the motion base position and orientation is required.  Secondly an investigationinto what driving cues are best presented through the motion base and what driving cues are best presented through the visual system must be performed.  Finally, best method of performing heading tracking in the CAVE with the motion base must bedetermined.  The final performance of the motion base system in the CAVE will be evaluated using driving simulation software in a typical product evaluation setting.",

The technology will also provide wide area subsurface sensing for ground probing applications. The phase I results demonstrated that the system has the capability of detecting human targets on the opposite of building walls and through walls of granite over 10m thick. The thrust of the phase II research lies in software development to classify targets in the downrange profile, track targets, and count targets; and hardware development to eliminate the need for an external off the shelf receiver. The latter effort will also require software development to process data for the classification algorithms. The unique innovation of this project is that it can conduct full area investigations and locate stationary targets from a fixed location.\r      There are two primary applications for this technology, situational awareness and subsurface investigation. The former, which is the most attractive for early market entry, comprises homeland security, police/fire/search and rescue, and military actions where the location of human subjects on the opposite side of walls, vegetation, snow, fire, or other opaque media is sought. The latter includes geophysical exploration, ore body investigation, utility detection and location, road-bed and bridge subsurface scans\r for cracks and voids, and unattended ground sensing from a fixed point to assess subsurface changes that can be used to predict earth or structural failure.",

This combination of headset and insert earphones will be designed to attenuate ambient acoustic noise during audiometric testing, and will replace sound isolation test rooms and mobile test facilities under certain ambient noise conditions. The portability of the system will enable it to be used in venues such as schools, nursing homes, prisons, and industrial plants. The result of this research will be tested pre-production units. The ultimate goal of this research and development will be to manufacture a portable audiometric testing system that provides noise-attenuation properties superior to a single-walled room in meeting ANSI S3.1-1 999 standards.",

Confirm that IRIDIUM will satisfy RAFT requirements by performing risk reduction activities.  Performance to be verified include data throughput, data quality, and latency.2.  Select an optimum RAFT interface technique for accessing service networks.  Multiple techniques exist for accessing the IRIDIUM network, and these alternate techniques will be evaluated, with an emphasis on latency.  These techniques include a\"seamless\" interface via use of the ARINC AviNet/GlobalLink networks.3.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The goal is to develop an automated and rapid system for human testing using dimorphic Alu repeats as genetic markers. Dimorphic Alu repeats are novel bi-allelic genetic markers that are identical by descent and stable. During the Phase I, we have demonstrated that the Alu markers can be caused for human identification. We have demonstrated that the Alu markers can be multiplexed and detected by hybridization based micro array assay. In Phase II, we will identify fifty Alu markers useful for identity testing. The PCR multiplex reactions will be optimized, so that the fifty markers can be amplified in three multiplex reactions. A micro-array format will be developed for genotyping. An integrated automated platform will be evolved for performing the complete testing. The end product will be an \"ALUtyping\" system that will be commercialized in partnership with a major cooperation. The commercial product will comprise of oligonucleotide micro-arrays, reagent kits for multiplexed PCR amplifications, hybridization buffers and consumables, and software for automated genotyping and data analysis. The major applications of this genotyping system will be in the fields of paternity, others areas of human identity and human evolution studies. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Current techniques used in the DNA identity testing business rely upon methods such as RFLP, which is laborious and time consuming or multiplex STR analysis this requires expensive kits and instrumentation. The dimorphic Alu markers coupled with a multi-plexed genotype analysis on a DNA array will provide a rapid, sensitive and highly cost- effective methodological alternative for DNA identity testing for the numerous private testing laboratories and low enforcement agencies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Accurate analysis of electromagnetic anechoic chambers is a challenging problem.  The geometry is complicated and includes multiple antenna radiators, systems under test (SUT), supporting structures, and absorber.  Furthermore the frequency range isextensive, traversing a broad range from 50 MHz to 18 GHz.  For the large chamber (264 x 250 x 70 feet) of the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) this means the chamber size in wavelengths varies over a very large range over which different calculationmethods must be applied for good accuracy.  Our approach is that for the lower range of frequencies the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method will be used to analyze the entire anechoic chamber. At the higher frequencies shooting ray methods can beused.   Both methods will be integrated under a single graphical user interface which will allow user control of the excitation antennas, system under test geometry, and calculation parameters.  The graphical user interface will also provide display offields over a variety of surfaces inside the chamber and straightforward comparison with measured fields for validation.  The ability to assess the effects of absorber reflection on the illumination of the system under test will be an important capabilityof the proposed software tool.",

To reduce risk and lower the government's cost, Lockheed Martin Systems Integration will provide areceiver-signal processor to host RAS' new detection, DF and SEI algorithms.  To demonstrate the receiver-signal processing capability, the team may employ an existing LMSI antenna design that supports the detection and DF performance goals specified inthe SBIR solicitation.

        "abstract": "Abstract         ResearchSouth has developed a powerful design optimization algorithm using an adjoint-based methodology for advanced aerospace vehicles including the airframe aerodynamic shape and the integrated propulsion system. The significance is that this algorithm separates the geometric entities from the optimization process allowing an independent linkage with many CAD packages and at much lower cost. All objectives have been met for the Phase I project. A computer software package, termed SAMdesign, now has the capability to solve the three-dimensional Euler equations, solve the adjoint of the Euler equations, and change the vehicle shape subject to constraints. All of these solutions are performed on unstructured tetrahedral meshes using a Finite Element based numerical algorithm. Four test cases have been successfully computed including a generic aerospace vehicle. Phase II will include multi-disciplinary effects, coupled physics for aerodynamics / propulsion / structures, fast finite element meshing methods, and will develop the software into a production package. Extensive verification and validation will be done on NASA configurations. The product will be documented, delivered and installed at NASA with a user-training course given. This will provide NASA with a powerful software tool to perform very efficient and rapid design assessment of evolving next generation space vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         RSI, an Industrial Associate of the Princeton University Photonics and Optoelectronic Materials group, proposes the development of a micro-chip energy-mass spectrograph for space environment sensing aboard microsatellites. The micro-machined energy-massspectrograph (M2-EMS) is envisioned as a micro-miniaturized replacement for conventional particle energy and mass detection systems employed as space environment sensors. The M2-EMS would employ parallel electric and magnetic fields to separate particlesby their energy:charge and mass:charge ratios. The spectrograph apertures would be micro-machined from Si wafers by anisotropic etching. Charged particle optic electrodes would be grown on the surface by thick photoresist lithographic electroformingtechniques. By using electroless deposition of Ni (a ferromagnet) into thick resist molds, magnetic field provided by external NdFeB permanent magnets can be channeled to provide high field regions for mass separation. By applying opposite potentialpolarities to the straight-wall Ni features, a region of high electric field can be produced to simultaneously separate particles by energy. Detection of spatially separated ions could be achieved by existing multichannel area detectors. Using multipleapertures with varying magnetic and electric separation fields atop the same multichannel detector, parallel detection of different energy and mass ranges can be achieved.",

The technology will combine ultrahigh storage capacity with ultra fast retrieval speed. The current retrieval rates of CD-ROM, DVD-ROM and MO technology is inherently limited for applications such as image retrieval for medical diagnosis or target recognition. The company's block retrieval technique is a new method for solving the bottleneck of data retrieval. Using imaging and pattern recognition techniques, data is retrieved in 2D blocks. This retrieval method will result in orders-of-magnitude increases in throughput and increases in storage density. Since the need for high density, high-speed storage is continuing to escalate, there will be a ready market from storage system vendors who supply products to the myriad of industries whose business depends upon volumes of storage and quick retrieval.",

This program addresses the NASAs need for nanotube-based materials that are lightweight, structurally robust, and environmentally stable. The key innovation is to develop techniques for fabrication of advanced composites through modification of nanotube surfaces. In the Phase I program we will prepare and evaluate a series of composites based on combination of reactive carbon nanotubes and high-performance polymers. Based on successful proof of feasibility in Phase I we will pursue a Phase II program where emphasis will be placed optimizing the most promising candidates identified in Phase I.

The MINO willp[rovide the low noise 2.5GHz (nominal) clock waveform for the next generation of ADCs.  RF Monolithics is providing microwave resonators and the final packaging configuration for this advanced oscillator and both will be optimized to reduce vibrationsensitivity.The microwave resonator used in the ruggedized MINO will be realized using surface transverse wave (STW) acoustic device technology and will be fabricated on a piezoelectric substrate derived from the langasite (LGS) family of materials.  We expect toachieve at least an order of magnitude improvement in both the unloaded Q and the vibration sensitivity of the resonator compared to devices constructed on more conventional quartz substrates.  The MINO module will be realized as a ceramic hybrid microwavecircuit, providing both component and interconnect stability for high reliability and low vibration sensitivity.Several resonator and hybrid configurations will be constructed and evaluated.  The final configuration of the ruggedized MINO is expected to be added to RFM's line of frequency control products.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal presents a program for the continued development of CSEA-ANVC: the application of \"complex SEA\" to problems in active noise and vibration control. It deals with a situation that has been intractable for ANVC  - the cancellation of transientdisturbances in modally rich and highly resonant structures and acoustical spaces. CSEA solves this problem by in effect modifying the structural transfer function so that small changes in structural stress or geometry that occur naturally do not cause thelarge changes in magnitude and phase of the transfer function to affect the estimation of the disturbing force that is necessary for feed-back ANVC. The proposal describes how we propose to continue the development of this procedure and how we will preparefor commercialization beyond Phase II. That development is carried out by a combination of experimental studies of a truss structure similar to that of a space telescope excited by various positioning and connect/disconnect devices in the system. The finalstep in the Phase II effort is the preliminary design of an embedded processor system that will serve as a prototype for the CSEA-ANVC product.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The long-term objective of this project is to develop software to facilitate the design of cost effective clinical trials. In 1999, the pharmaceutical industry and NIH spent more than $23 billion on clinical trials. Developments in clinical trial design theory, and in optimization algorithms have opened possibilities for more cost- effective designs that can be executed for lower total cost, over shorter periods of time and / or requiring fewer patients. The proposed System for Cost Effective Trials (SCET) will be a software package to guide the trial designer through comparisons of the power, sample size requirements, and cost of alternate trial designs. These methods are under-used throughout medical research, but are particularly applicable to trials with relatively short treatment regimens and rapid ascertainment of endpoints, such as many cancer treatment trials. The aims of SCET Phase II are to build the system, validate it in compliance with FDA regulations for software validation, perform Beta testing at a range of target client organizations, and use the Beta test findings to produce a marketable release. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The potential market for this software system includes virtually every pharmaceutical company in the world (multiple licenses to each), every biotech company involved in clinical trials, every contract research organization involved in the design or conduct of clinical trials, coordinating centers of NIH-sponsored multi-center clinical trials, individual university-based investigators who conduct clinical trials, individual biostatistical consultants who design clinical trials, and agricultural businesses and researchers that conduct animal research.",

The Phase I work showed the turbocompressor section of diesel generator sets to be excellent candidates for this integration and design.  Failure frequency and seriousness, and the potential for a very cost-effective integration and design confirmed the choice of these components.  BothNavy and commercial application show the substantial opportunity for maintenance savings.  The design achieved in Phase I has drawn support from Caterpillar, major ship builders, a turbo compressor manufacturer and the cognizant Navy Offices.  Phase IIwill result in a prototype system demonstration, and a market ready design intended for both Navy and commercial applications.BENEFITS: The benefits anticipated from this project fall into three categories: 1) The direct and near term benefits derived fromcost savings in acquisition and maintenance of diesel powered generator sets and other diesels. Savings result from avoiding the cost of separate CBM and control system components and from the reduced cost of maintenance compared to traditional preventivepractices or run-to-failure; 2) Lessons learned and system design accomplished on this project will translate readily to other ships machinery, both new and lagacy, generating savings as descr",

When fully implemented, such a system will wirelessly provide consistent and accurate status ofspecified monitored parameters in a given \"\"space\"\" on a ship. Using temperature, pressure, flood, smoke, and other transducers, RLW will expand its Phase I prototype system to monitor all parameters found in the target application:  Shaft AlleyCompartment (#5-300-0-E) of DDG-51 Class ships.  RLW will test the Phase II system in its own lab and at a realistic land-based platform.  In the Phase II Option, RLW will install the test system on a Navy ship.  As in Phase I, RLW will again partner withtwo industry leaders, General Dynamics-Electric Boat, a well-known and long-time manufacturer of submarines for the Navy, and Sentinel Business Systems, a company with vast commercial experience in networking hardware and software, data management, anddatabase integration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The ?space adaptation syndrome? develops in conditions in which nauseogenic stimuli are present for a long period. The perceptual situation of an astronaut exposed to unusual gravitational-inertial forces has been compared to that found in experiments involving perceptual rearrangement, such as optically induced displacement, curvature, tilt, or right-left reversal. In both instances, the observer is confronted with a variety of inter- and intra-sensory conflicts that initially disrupt perception and behavior and may cause nausea. However, people are able to adapt to these imposed conflicts, as manifested in a reduction or elimination of the initial disruptive responses. Overcoming motion sickness and regaining normal perception may involve many of the same processes as adaptation to perceptual rearrangement in general. Our Phase I research demonstrated that adaptation training is beneficial as it reduces dizziness and motion sickness symptoms experienced in both VR and OKN environments. In Phase II research, we propose to run studies to test further the effects of adaptation training on sickness by inducing motion sickness in a VR device with an added ?reafference? component. Phase II research will also involve refining and replicating Phase I findings, broadening the aftereffect conditions to which adaptation applies (sickness, posture, eye hand coordination, changes)",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Ambient particulate matter (PM) mass exposure is determined by collecting the PM on a sample filter over a period of 24 hours. Because the composition of ambient PM is constantly changing, the PM mass measured using the reference method may not be representative of the PM levels in the atmosphere, primarily due to the loss of collected semi-volatile material that is present in the atmosphere during the collection period. In addition, by obtaining a single value over a 24-hour period, the method may not properly recognize the true exposure risks that occur during short term spikes in the ambient PM levels. Rupprecht & Patashnick Co., Inc. (R&P;) proposes to resolve these issues through the use of an innovative advance to their popular TEOM Ambient Particulate Monitor. The TEOM mass monitor is a filter-based, inertial micro-balance that provides direct mass measurements of the collected material in near real time. The innovation, the Differential TEOM System, is a self-referencing system that utilizes an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) to periodically remove the ambient PM from the sample stream to allow the system to measure sampling artifacts caused by the presence of semi-volatile compounds such as ammonium nitrate or semi-volatile organics. The Phase I research project compared the results obtained using the initial prototype Differential TEOM monitor operating at ambient temperature with results from an early test Differential TEOM monitor operating at a fixed control temperature and with reference method results, with all samples collected at R&P;'s facilities in Albany, NY. The real-time comparison showed that the performance of the ambient Differential TEOM monitor accurately reflects the mass concentration measured using the other sample methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Current methods of separation of starch and protein that have been successful in producing corn and other types of starches do not work well with rice. Rice granules are very small (usually about 3 to 6 microns in size) and are difficult to separate from rice protein, which are of similar size. Yields of starch are low, recovery of quality protein is rarely achievable, and so the resulting rice starch is too expensive to compete in the market. The unique small size of rice creates market opportunities for rice starch if cost could be reduced. We hope to commercialize a physical process to separate rice starch from rice protein. We hope to improve the yields of starch, produce a high quality rice protein that can be sold into the human market, and reduce costs of wastewater treatment. If successful, our process would use clean untreated water. The starch and protein produced from such a process would be \"all natural\" and potentially more valuable to the market than chemically treated starches. We will continue to work with and develop a concept that was initially developed by the USDA research lab in New Orleans through a CRADA with Sage V Foods, and then further developed in a phase 1 SBIR Grant. Under certain conditions a microfluidizer machine has been shown to physically separate starch and protein by causing the particles to collide against each other while in a liquid slurry at very high pressures. The overall objective is to develop a method of rice starch extraction that will make the manufacture and marketing of rice starch an economic success by increasing the yields of pure starch extracted from rice to over 70% (preferably over 75%) and to produce and recover a marketable protein that has not been treated with chemicals. The target yield for protein is greater than 6% at 80% purity. The specific objectives of the project will be: 1. Test various chamber and pressure conditions in the \"microfluidizer\" to determine the best shear conditions for protein that produces a functionality that facilitates separation of starch and protein. 2. Test two different types of nozzle disc centrifuges (Westfalia separator and Alpha Laval) in combination with additional centrifugation and/or hydrocyclones and various processing techniques to obtain starch purity of 99.5%, while at the same time achieving protein purity of over 80%. Also test a basket centrifuge and peeler centrifuge for the same purpose. 3. Utilizing centrifuges and hydrocyclones, develop an economical method to recover rice protein from the wash water and then dry the protein. Achieve yields of greater than 6% at 80 percent purity. 4. Test spray drying and basket centrifuge/oven drying to develop an economical method to dry rice starch, while producing a product of less than 10 micros size and without developing rancidity.",

Salix Medical's (patent pending) removable cast walker (ACE walker) uses a unique shear modulation technology to eliminate peaks in pressure and shear at the sole of the foot. Such peaks usually initiate or exacerbate a destructive pathway that involves ulceration and may well lead to amputation in patients with diabetes. This randomized clinical trial will evaluate the 1) ACE walker versus 2) the clinical 'gold standard\" Total Contact Casts and 3) standard Healing Sandals to heal diabetic foot ulcers. In addition the study will evaluate functional status and health care costs among treatment groups. Three groups of thirty-five diabetics with neuropathic ulcerations will be selected to participate in a 12-week clinical trial. At baseline, and at two week intervals, clinical evaluations will be performed to assess wound size and depth.",

No commercially available insoles are designed to reduce shear. Although insurance providers spend millions on diabetics? therapeutic insoles, there is no scientific data about shear or pressure reduction. We will evaluate the optimal bonded materials from Phase I compared to the ShearSole TM design using the same combination of viscoelastic materials. We will evaluate 2 patient groups of 150 patients per arm (300 total) in an 18 month trial. The control group patient arm will wear a traditional bonded insole whereas another the second arm will receive the ShearSoleTM. At baseline, and at the end of the 18 month trial, in-shoe gait lab and in vitro biomechanical parameters will measure pressure, shear, and material properties as these change with wear. This Phase II eighteen (18) month clinical trial will evaluate the effectiveness of ShearSoleTM reducing the incidence of diabetic ulcers. The overall study hypothesis is that ShearSole TM will provide significant shear reduction as compared to traditional insoles without sacrificing pressure reduction characteristics or durability. In the long-term, this technology will be incorporated into removable cast walkers (to heal ulcers), wheelchair cushions and mattress pads (to prevent development of decubitus ulcers).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A primary goal of research on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is to identify and evaluate interventions that improve a child?s ability to control attention and working memory. However, there is no standardized efficient means for measuring neurological signals and systems of attention with which to objectively assess treatment-related improvements in this fundamental cognitive ability. We have been developing a self-contained system, the Children?s Attention and Performance Evaluation System (CAPESYS) to address this need. Our prior research suggests that sensitive and specific indices of sustained attention and working memory, functions disrupted in ADHD, can be derived from multivariate combinations of EEG and behavioral performance measures. During Phase I, analysis of data from children with ADHD being treated with stimulant medication suggested that our approach could efficiently identify those who responded positively to such treatment. Progress was also made in identifying aspects of EEG signal processing algorithms requiring adaptation for use with children?s data, and on the ongoing design and implementation of an automated clinical testing system that will provide the infrastructure for the CAPESYS. In Phase II we propose to extend and further validate our procedures, implement a prototype system and evaluate it in collaborative studies with ADHD specialists. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: ADHD is a common childhood neurological disorder. It is frequently treated pharmacologically with stimulants, yet there is no neurological instrument for measuring treatment-related improvements in child's attention functions. The proposed device would provide a critical technology for evaluation of neurophysiological and behavioral aspects of sustained focused attention. It would facilitate research and permit more effective and economical management of individual patients. There is a large potential market for it among pediatric neurologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and other professionals involved with treatment of ADHD in children.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many medical treatments produce subtle changes in working and intermediate term memory and executive functioning in the elderly.  Some medical treatments may have negative cognitive side effects, whereas other treatments improve cognitive function.  Prior work demonstrates that combinations of EEG, event related potential and cognitive task performance data are sensitive and specific indicators of level of alertness and ability to sustain attention and hold information in working and intermediate term memory.  We propose to develop a specialized automated device utilizing multivariate combinations of these measures to detect treatment related changes in neurocognitive function in the elderly.  In Phase I feasibility was evaluated by analyzing task performance and EEG data from elderly subjects after they ingested a common OTC drug, the antihistamine diphenhydramine.  We computed multivariate indices from these data, and determined that they could discriminate post-drug conditions from placebo.  Additionally, we identified improvements required for use of our automated task presentation and signal processing algorithms with elderly subjects, and designed modifications to a system for administering, analyzing and tracking tests and results.  In Phase II, the system will be fully implemented and independently tested in collaboration with scientists and clinicians at four university medical centers.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The proposed system will enable researchers to better evaluate how medical treatments affect neurocognitive function in the elderly.  The market for such a device is sufficient to sustain the product.  The system may also prove clinically useful as a means for titrating drug dosages and for tracking neurocognitive changes in the treatment of individual patients.  Thus, a second-generation device may serve as a more general clinical tool for monitoring changes in cognitive status in the elderly.  There is a large and rapidly growing market for such a clinical device.",

Specifically, we will developsolutions that will allow such a network  to provide:      differentiated services to real time and best effort traffic   bandwidth allocation and, more generally, performance guarantees to accepted real time connections     resource aware and precedence compliant Call Admission Control to enforce guarantees   efficient and fair bandwidth sharing among applications in the same class;     enforcement of priorities across traffic classes;      renegotiation  of bandwidth and other resource when  path characteristics change after connection setup;In Phase II, we will perform high-fidelity simulations to demonstrate efficacy of these techniques in both MOSAIC and FCS communication scenarios.  The software will be developed at a level of fidelity that is capable of being directly transitioned to anoperational platform.",

However, there is relatively little understanding of the behavior of such networks, as they are scaled up, particularly for traffic withstrict Quality of Service requirements.   The eventual goal of this SBIR is to develop MANET-Sim, a simulator for Mobile Ad hoc NETworks, with the ability to simulate wireless networks with thousands of nodes, in real time, on common desktop platforms thatare likely to become available within the next three years.   In Phase II, we will develop a methodology and associated tools to support a detailed  analysis of the scalability properties of  routing protocols in mobile, ad hoc wireless networks (MANET).We will  identify the metrics, experiments, and Measures of Performance (MOP); select a relevant set MANET protocols, and develop multi-fidelity protocol models as appropriate.   An important result of this effort will be to identify specific routingprotocols that meet the various scalability MOPs that have been identified.    It will also allow computation of the parameter bounds (size, number of hops, network traffic, etc.) within which a given ad hoc network can operate and still provide adequateperformance.",

Schafer?s Phase II objective is to use Silicon Lightweight Mirrors (SLMS), a novel, all-silicon, foam-core, lightweight mirror technology, to build three imaging mirrors for the Next Generation Space Telescope Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) Engineering Test Unit: M0 (a flat), M2 (a concave sphere) and M3R (an oblate spheroid). The surface figure error specification for the NIRCam imaging mirrors is 8 nm rms (0.013 waves rms @633 nm), equivalent to that required for UV and EUV mirrors, and this figure must be maintained at the 35 K operational temperature of NGST. The surface roughness required is 30 ? rms since NIRCam operates in the VIS/IR (0.65-5 ?m). We will produce mounts for mirrors M2 and M3R using the complementary thermally matched C/SiC material demonstrated by Schafer under another NASA SBIR, NAS8-98137.SLMS technology will significantly impact and benefit a very broad set of future NASA Space Science Enterprise (e.g., Explorer Program) and Earth Science Enterprise (e.g., GOES-R) missions.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The existing plasma codes are ill suited for modeling of mixed resolution problems, such as the plasma sail, where the system under study comprises subsystems with diverse modeling paradigms (e.g., fluid, kinetic) at differing levels of temporal and spatial resolution. Such complex systems are not unique to propulsion studies, but are commonly encountered in wide variety of fields. In Phase I, we were able to develop and successfully test the core technology for multi-resolution modeling within two distinct computational paradigms. By introducing a temporal mesh, we successfully overcame a major obstacle in the use of time-stepped simulations for multi-resolution problems. However, even more significant is our finding that discrete event simulation methodology works quite well for many-body systems such as plasmas with several orders of magnitude performance advantage over equivalent time-stepped simulations. The importance of this result cannot be overstated as it will have immediate repercussions in all fields where time-stepped modeling are currently used. Using these early versions of our code, we were able to address a number of outstanding issues in regards to the feasibility of plasma sails. Our objectives for Phase II are (i) to fully develop the codes, (ii) address the issues regarding the feasibility of plasma sails such as expansion of the magnetic bubble by the plasma source and the resulting drop-off of the magnetic field strength with radial distance, and (iii) prepare plans for marketing our technology in Phase III.",

The key component of this lidar is a compact all-solid-state laser developed by us, which is rapidly tunable in the mid-IR (2.7-4m). Phase I simulations have shown that 150ppb range resolved and 30ppb path integrated (for1.5km) measurements of benzene are obtained for a few seconds of averaging with a lidar equipped with a 8\"diameter telescope,  100Hz, 1mJ/pulse laser tunable in 3-4m region. Atmospheric lidar absorption measurements of methane were also performed in PhaseI with a tunable mid-IR DIAL system and showed good agreement with directly measured methane concentrations. A prototype mid-IR chemical DIAL will be built in Phase II and tested using non-toxic simulants. As option tasks the self-powered lidar system willbe made robust for field operation by using a modular transmitter/receiver unit that is fiber coupled to laser/power supply unit.

This UAV based lidar provides a powerful low cost capability for measurement of ozone distributions in the lower stratosphere and troposphere with good spatial resolution over large regions. The UAV places severe constraints on the size, weight, power and operational environment for the laser. A compact Ce:LiCAF laser pumped by a diode-pumped Nd:YAG frequency quadrupled laser, to provide 1mJ energy at 1kHz, tunable over 290-315nm will be built to satisfy these requirements. Ozone measurements from 20km altitude with good horizontal resolution (5km) and accuracy (5-10%) will be obtained using this laser. The laser will be packaged into a replaceable modular transmitter which allows for easy reconfiguration of the UAV for other measurements. This transmitter, together with the water vapor DIAL transmitter recently fabricated by us, will constitute the core of a versatile NASA remote sensing facility. In Phase I we will carry out the wavelength tuning and operational characterization of a bread-board tunable Ce:LiCAF laser, and also design an optimized transmitter. In Phase II the autonomous ozone DIAL transmitter will be built and tested.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The main purpose of this proposal is to develop a novel interface for on- line coupling of liquid separation techniques to a mass spectrometer (MS) using an atmospheric pressure (AP) infrared (IR) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) method. In contrast to conventional MALDI where ions are formed inside a vacuum system. In AP MALDI they are produced at normal atmospheric pressure. AP MALDI was first demonstrated and later commercialized using an ultraviolet (UV) laser. It showed sensitivity comparable to that of conventional MALDI, a large tolerance to the laser energy, and minimal fragmentation of analyte ions. AP MALDI interfaced with an ion trap mas spectrometer brings unique capability off tandem MS (or MS/MS) to MALDI analysis. Since AP UV-MALDI uses mostly solid organic matrices it like conventional UV- MALDI usually allows off-line analysis only. The use of an IR laser will allow one to use significantly larger number of matrices for MS analysis including liquid ones. Given excellent absorption or organic compounds in the IR spectral range the AP IR-MALDI makes possible direct coupling of liquid separation techniques =to MS, thus, the perspective of having both MALDI and electrospray ion sources for liquid analysis on the same mass analyzer becomes very feasible. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Atmospheric Pressure IR-MALDI for interfacing mass spectrometers to liquid separation techniques as well as for off-line analysis. This method has many biological and biomedical applications in research labs, hospitals, industry, and defense where analysis of proteins, peptides, DNA & RNA is utilized. Commercialization of the method by SESI is straightforward.",

Proposed is a simple instrument using multiple hot wire elements to measure cloud droplet size (median volume diameter) and liquid water content.The unit utilizes three hot wire sensor elements each of a different geometry, all exposed to the same airflow. By virtue of their different sizes/shapes, the elements have different measurment efficiencies with respect to droplet diameter.Liquid water content is determined by the total amount of water measured by all three elements. Droplet median volume diameter is determined by the response differences between the three elements. The range of droplet measurement includes super large droplets SLD).The proposed instrument has no moving parts, no optics and emits no electromagnetic radiation. It is a first principles device capable of complete calibration. Its response time is under one second.Total frontal area of the instrument is less than four square inches. Less than 500 watts of power are required for operation in continuous icing conditions. The operational airspeed range is compatible with operational jet and turboprop transport aircraft.Applications include icing research and operational cockpit warning for icing and SLD conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a passive, nonintrusive species-specific velocimeter (SSV) that simultaneously measures spatially resolved velocities of multiple species in a flame, sorting the information by species and spatial scale size. The SSV will be geared to spatially resolve the mixing and chemical dynamics occurring within flames, and to track these effects in real time. No instruments are available that can make such measurements passively and non-invasively in a com-pact geometry. The SSV will play a critical role in a novel deposition process, combustion chemical vapor deposition (CCVD). CCVD is a continuous open-air deposition process that is targeting a wide spectrum of thin-film-coating markets, including electronics, glass, anti-corrosives, superconductors, catalytics, polymers, and nanopowders. Phase 1 demonstrated feasibility by measuring spatially resolved, species-specific CCVD flame velocities on different spatial scales. Phase 2 will be a proof-of-principal program to (1) construct an engineering prototype, (2) demonstrate the correlation between SSV data and bottom-line CCVD film properties, and (3) design an SSV-based CCVD controller that can be fabricated economically and commercialized in a privately funded This technology will facilitate smart deposition that streamlines the reliability of CCVD. Incorporated into a CCVD system, the SSV will become the central element of a feedback control module that maintains the consistency of the flame and maximizes deposition efficiency. The commercial market for this technology generates about $50 million annually. This project addresses the interest in advanced control techniques for manufacturing. It supports the development of improved and more reliable coatings that will enhance technology and lower the cost of many common products, e.g. electronic memory devices in computers, appliances, and automobiles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The need for an Illuminator Laser plus system weight issues for the high energy weapon laser are significant problems for the ABL. The significant challenges arise from the present approach of dissociating I2 by the use of a substantial fraction ofgenerated O2(a1D). The successful Phase I showed that RF plasma discharges rapidly dissociated an Iodine bearing com-pound, CH3I, thus providing a new source of iodine atoms for COILs. The plasma production of iodine atoms potentially frees up allmetastable excitation energy stored in the O2(a1D) population to exclusively pump the lasing cycle, increasing O2(a1D) utilization and laser system chemical efficiency by ~15%. The result is potentially increased laser power, reduced system weight and atechnology with the promise of high repetition rate (~5 to 25 kHz) pulsed COILs for target illumination and other COIL applications.  On Phase II, SARA will optimize the RF transmission line, special trace gases additives and other plasma characteristics(applied to supersonic flow chemical laser systems) to increase the RF plasma dissociation efficiency. The final proof of concept will take place on a supersonic flow COIL with the RF plasma initiation electrodes designed into the primary nozzle wall orcavity regions of the device.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Space based lidar systems for the remote sensing of Ozone require high-power, high-efficiency lasers operating in the ultraviolet. Diode-pumped solid-state lasers are the primary candidates for this application. Operation in the ultraviolet is typically achieved through two or three frequency conversion steps using nonlinear optical materials. This reduces the efficiency of the laser systems placing very stringent demands on the laser design and the gain media. A promising material for use in lasers for the remote sensing of Ozone is Nd:Y2O3 operating at 914 nm and 948 nm using the 4F3/2 to 4I9/2 transition of the Nd3+ ion. This material offers several advantages over other crystals, including a lower threshold for oscillation of this transition, a high thermal conductivity, and a broad transmission range from 0.23 microns to 8 microns. Recent studies indicate that this material is well suited to Ozone lidar applications provided that crystals of sufficient size and quality are available. This Phase I SBIR project is aimed at developing growth systems to produce high optical quality Y2O3 and at demonstrating proof of concept for scaling of such systems to produce laser rods of sufficient size for use in lasers systems capable of meeting NASA's requirements for Ozone sensing.",

These types of lasers are capable of operating at high efficiency while remaining both compact and extremely rugged. However, one of the primary limitations of such systems has been that the laser gain media operates only at specific wavelengths determined by the active dopant ion. These wavelengths do not necessarily match absorption features or transmission windows specific to a given application. Scientific Materials Corp. has recently developed innovative laser gain media that provides operation at the desired wavelength without the need for frequency conversion or tuning elements. It is the purpose of this Phase II SBIR to improve the optical homogeneity and optimize the performance of these materials for diode pumping, as well as scale the growth of these materials to allow implementation in a variety of cavity designs. Based on previous results, the primary material of interest will be Nd3+ doped crystals of YAG(1-x)YSAGx for operation at 944.1 nm for use in lasers for lidar systems designed for remote sensing of atmospheric water vapor.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A solid state air-gap Fabry-Perot is configured in tandem with a switchable holographic optic element established by holographic polymer liquid crystal dispersion. This switchable element is the innovative centerpiece developed during Phase I research. By stacking these tuning elements, one per wavelength channel, any discrete channel within the operating range (which can include multiple orders) of a Fabry-Perot etalon can be selected for transmission to any receiver in a LIDAR or spectroscopy system. A sealed, solid state etalon combined with a switchable holographic element can replace a tunable etalon system. This has advantages with respect to LIDAR system cost, complexity and weight. Multiplexing allows additional spectral elements to be selected simultaneously or a channel may be switched in milliseconds. The device can thus isolate hundreds of individual wavelengths across the tunable range of a tunable laser or LIDAR transmitter. These capabilities are accomplished with no moving parts, and with a significant cost advantage over competing technologies.",

One of the critical issues for autonomous rendezvous and docking systems is the ability to estimate the relative position between the Chase spacecraft and theResident Space Object (RSO). Under this effort, SSC will develop a Vision System for Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking (VISARD) containing a comprehensive suite of Vision-based algorithms for estimation of relative position, relative velocity, angularvelocity, and RSO pose. Additional features include algorithms for fusion and cross-validation of video-based and laser-based estimates, and algorithms for computing optimal minimum fuel circumnavigation path for RSO imaging. VISARD will be suitable forboth stereo and single-camera systems. Phase II efforts will also comprise extensive hardware-in-the-loop tests, and testing and evaluation using actual flight data. For this effort and Phase III commercialization, SSC has teamed up with Pyramid VisionTechnologies (a subsidiary of Sarnoff Corporation), and NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",

The proposed algorithms will result in fast and accurateon-line FDI and ARC for EMAs whose behavior is characterized byhighly nonlinear dynamics. The proposed on-line HM-FDI and ARCscheme will be integrated into Boeing's open Prognostics and HealthManagement (PHM) and Open Control Platform (OCP)architectures. In order to achieve the above objectives, we propose tocarry out in Phase I the following tasks: (i) Formulation of theHM-FDI and ARC problem for Electro-Mechanical Actuators(EMAs). (ii) Acquisition of nonlinear actuator models from Boeing.(iii) Development of on-line nonlinear HM-FDI and ARCalgorithms compatible with the PHM and OCP architectures for thenonlinear actuator models. (iv) Testing, tuning and performanceevaluation of the algorithms on a linearized TAFA simulation. (v)Integration of the HM-FDI and ARC algorithms into the PHM andOCP. In Phase II we plan to integrate our HM-FDI and ARCalgorithms into Boeing's PMH and OCP systems and test them underlaboratory conditions at Boeing, and in flight tests.

The paradigm innovations are based upon symbology advances using augmented reality and synthetic vision to provide a common virtual visualenvironment for all friendly forces to see, share, and synchronize tactics and weapon delivery. New symbology classes include, but are not limited to, geo-registered symbology providing common A/G virtual overlays; shooter-to-target pairing symbology forcoordination of team attacks; synchronized-countdown-to-simultaneous-kill; combined arms common framework for Sensor-Decision-Maker-Shooter prosecution of Time-Critical-Targets symbology; and RAPCOM (RAPide-COMmunication) for enhanced information transferand retention. An illustrative symbology is the ArchAngel Circle-of-Death, which displays a virtual mile-wide compass with cross hairs and markings that can be superimposed over enemy targets, for Close-Air-Support.

While the initial excitation process canbe predicted using linear analysis, the instability often entersa \"limit-cycle\", in which the maximum pressure amplitude levelsoff.  This limit-cycle amplitude may only be predicted using non-linear analysis.  It will be helpful for SRM designers to know ifa predicted instability will be detrimental or if the amplitudeis small enough to be ignored.  The current 1-D stabilityprediction code (SSP) only performs the linear analysis.  InPhase I of this SBIR, SEA examined the current non-linearcombustion stability theories and mathematical approaches.  Notonly has SEA determined that the non-linear approach may beincorporated into the SPP/SSP code set, but SEA has alsoimplemented a 1-D nonlinear model and linked it to the output ofSPP/SSP.  Testing of this model and implementation of furthermodels will be conducted in Phase II.BENEFITS: This research will result in an innovative design tool to predict combustion instability amplitudes of an unstable solid rocket motor during the design phase.

This new approach will eliminate the typical requirement for a PCR           amplification step in SNP assays, and therefore will be ideally suited for           ultra-high throughput screening of large populations.                                                                                                                     The assay is based on the use of an oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA), a DNA      microarray, and our novel reporter label (PRP) that allows for ultrasensitive        detection of DNA.                                                                                                                                                         We expect that the completion of our SBIR program will result in the                 commercialization of SNP identification using kits, protocols, and reagents for      population screening and pharmacogenomics for sale to both the research and          clinical biomedical communities. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The sale of  kits and reagents that will become the preferred methodology for the screening of human populations for SNPs associated with specific age related diseases, such as Alzheimer's,  breast cancer, and cardiovascular deterioration.  The design of inexpensive user-friendly instrumentation suitable for individual medical practioners, clinical screening laboratories, and research facilities.",

The extensive use of cell culture to provide models for biochemical and molecular biological research serves to magnify these errors at great expense. The prototype Cell Culture Laboratory Management Software (CCLMS), developed for a Phase I award, has improved efficiency and reduced the error intrinsic to manual recordkeeping in two independent laboratories. The CCLMS prototype successfully encapsulates a modular software application that manages the many aspects of the Cell Culture Laboratory. (i) A transaction based database stores detailed information on subcultures, freezes, and thaws; (ii) prints waterproof labels for culture vessels; and (iii) provides immediate historical trace-back of cultured cell lines. (iv) A frozen cell log maintains locations of all vials within any type of storage unit; (v) locates spaces for newly frozen cell lines, and (vi) generates alphabetical or numerical reports. (vii) Modules for maintaining cell counts, user records, and culture vessel specifications support a comprehensive automation process. It is the goal of this proposal to develop a scalable, commercially available version of the CCLMS to fulfill the needs of small, medium and large size cell culture facilities in a user-friendly and networkable manner.",

The new structural composite has material properties approaching those of reaction bonded SiC (high specific stiffness and thermal stability), ability to be formed into near-net shapes and the durability of a composite. Phase I showed the viability of a composite that combines a novel, low-cost fiber coating process developed in conjunction with the University of Illinois-Chicago and Drexel University with our reaction bonded SiC. This combination provides three critical discriminators for SiC structural materials: (1) low-cost fabrication (fraction of the cost of CVI process) and scaleability, (2) the ability to achieve complex shapes using the inherent near net shape forming of RB SiC and (3) material properties that are well matched to RB SiC while providing increased durability.

The method and prototype product developed as part of this Phase I proposal can replace louvers and provide improved performance with significantly reduced complexity and weight.The approach, which only works in a space environment and with a cold background, is based on the fact that the radiation from a high emissivity samples will be maximum when that surface is in intimate (good thermal) contact with a higher temperature surface, and is near or at that temperature. Alternately, when this thermal contact is missing, the radiation to a cold environment will lower its temperature and the radiation from this cover (which can be viewed as the total system emissivity) system will approach that of the lower emissivity, high temperature surface. Calculations indicate that an effective emissivity change from .05 to 1 can be obtained when an electrostatic attraction is used to insure this intimate contact. Preliminary results of this system, using a thermal imager, indicate that the basic concept is viable, with measured changes in the apparent emissivity, from .38 to .95. Fabricating a practical coating requires detailed system design but does not require any technical breakthroughs.",

Recognizing this threat, public health agencies throughout the world have emphasized the importance of expeditious detection of drug resistance and the implementation of appropriate therapy. \r \r Conventional laboratory methods used to confirm the diagnosis of TB by isolating M. tuberculosis and performing antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) can take weeks due to the growth rate of mycobacteria. Using the latest detection methods, which are routinely available in developed countries, can provide culture results in as few as 4-7 days with subsequent antibiotic susceptibility profiles in another 4-5 days in some cases. These sophisticated tests are very expensive and must be performed by trained technologists; this makes them technically and financially infeasible for use in developing countries where MDR-TB is the greatest threat. \r \r Dr. Bill Jacobs addressed the need for a new diagnostic by modifying a mycobacteriophage (a virus that infects mycobacteria) to incorporate the firefly luciferase gene (FFlux); mycobacteria infected with phage produce light upon addition of the substrate luciferin. The light can be detected and quantitated by using a device called the Bronx Box; a camera connected to a computer. The test is performed in less than forty hours in a six-welled chamber/manifold which contains antibiotics. The Bronx Box device and accompanying test manifold will provide an easy-to-use, inexpensive, clinical diagnostic test with a faster turnaround time than current methods. \r \r The long-term goal of this proposal is to continue the commercial development of the Bronx Box and make this test available in clinics throughout the world.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"Shared Spectrum Company and Synergy Microwave Company propose to design a low power, low cost tuner with very high dynamic range and low noise figure for small tactical UAV SIGINT applications. The focus of the project is the design of an innovative highintercept point mixer and a preamplifier with very low noise and high dynamic range. Both will cover the frequency range of HF to 40 GHz. The tuner will have a very high input third order intercept point and a low noise figure from HF to 6 GHz, that willprovide an 81 dB spurious free dynamic range (10 MHz bandwidth), which is at least 10 dB better than any receiver in the world covering this frequency range. By using a modular down converter, the tuner's range will be extended to 40 GHz, but with reducedperformance. The prime power requirements for a four-channel system will be approximately 60 W. Because the design will use high-volume design practices and highly integrated circuits, the tuner production cost will be low \" $20 k). The mixer and amplifierdeveloped in this project will be widely applicable to commercial and military applications, such as cellular phone base stations, advanced multi-band transceivers, and the DoD's JTRS radio. During Phase I, extensive simulations using advanced non-linearsimulation tools will be used to verify the tuner performance and the initial design layouts will be made. Assisting in this program is Dr. UIrich Rohde, a world-renowned receiver desi",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a high level graphical programming environment for distributed measurement and control networks used in industry.  Using this environment, an industrial control engineer will be able to describe the desired behavior of his/her system at a high level of abstraction (e.g. 'control motor speed', 'monitor bearing', 'monitor pump') and then \"click a button\" for the executable distributed application to be generated.  In addition, the engineer will be able to monitor the behavior of the executing system at the graphical level to help identify problems.  This system will automatically partition the graphical description into components targeted at specific processors on the network based upon the resources required by the algorithm.  This functionality will greatly benefit the industrial control engineer, who will be able to focus on algorithm and application development rather than details of hardware and networking realizations.\r \r As the commercial potential of distributed approaches are becoming more prevalent in industrial applications, the potential of this software system will grow at a fast rate.  For example, 15 network controllers instead of one now manage a Proctor & Gamble diaper manufacturing line.  Currently the market for distributed measurement and control is fragmented, with over 60 proprietary process network standards in use.  The advent of the IEEE 1451 smart transducer standard creates a huge market opportunity by providing a portable application model that enables development tools, such as those being developed in this project, to be used with the multitude of existing commercial process busses.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65072     The use of high thermal conductivity aluminum nitride (AlN) components can boost the performance of power electronic and microwave devices significantly.  However, the lack of suitable metallization and brazing technologies, required to join the AlN components to each other and to metallic members, hampers AlN insertion into vacuum electron devices and power semiconductor packages.  This project will develop a hermetic refractory metallization technology, along with associated brazing technologies, to attach AlN composites to copper members for microwave tube and power semiconductor packaging applications.  Phase I investigated refractory Mo-Mn thick film metallization, active metal brazing, and diffusion bonding techniques to attach AlN and lossy AlN dielectrics to copper members.  The adhesive strength of the thick-film-metallized, active-metal-brazed, and diffusion-bonded AlN-Cu joints were measured; hermeticity of the joints was evaluated using leak tests; and chemical and microstructural characterization of the metallized and brazed interfaces was performed.  Phase II will develop a molybdenum thick film metallization based on the glasses identified in Phase I, along with associated nickel-plating and brazing techniques, to attach AlN components to copper members.               Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Almost every medium-to-high vacuum electron device would benefit from new hermetic, refractory metallization that is compatible with high-thermal-conductivity aluminum nitride composites.  Applications include klystrons and gyrotrons to supply microwave energy in chemical processes, materials processing, direct broadcast satellites, magnetic fusion, and microwave communications.",

Technology exists to capture knowledge; putting it into a useful, accessible format for later SD lags behind.  InPhase II, we will implement and test our prototype solution: TAGGER.  TAGGER will enable richer communication between KA and SD by allowing `tagging' knowledge as it is acquired, using SD-relevant terms.  Tagging will be done during knowledge elicitationand will require little extra effort beyond taking notes.  Because tags are SD-relevant, later knowledge inspec-tion is facilitated and links are carried forward even into testing and re-design.  Autonomous software `critics' will use tagging structures todetect flaws and patterns of interest or concern.  We are using the industry standard Unified Modeling Language (UML) to structure `tags' and integrate them into SD, and illustrating UML's ability to duplicate the Task Network Toolset used on RPA andproposed for AATD's Hunter Standoff Killer Team (HSKT).

The phenotype of a degP knockout in Escherichia coli, temperature and oxidative sensitivity, suggests a role in virulence. The DegP protease is a multifunctional protein essential for the removal of misfolded and aggregated proteins in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria. We have identified the major pilin subunit of the Pap pilus, PapA, as a native DegP substrate and demonstrate vigorous proteolysis of this substrate in vitro. The DegP cleavage site in PapA was mapped and an in vitro cleavage assay suitable for HTS was developed. Hits that arise from the HTS will be passed through a series of secondary screening assays and in vivo models to identify bioavailable inhibitors of DegP that display good selectivity. We recently identified DegP homologues in S. pyogenes and S. aureus and demonstrated that a degP knockout in S. pyogenes has reduced virulence. We propose to validate S. aureus DegP as a virulence factor and develop this target for screening. There is ample precedent for the efficacy of protease inhibitors as therapeutic agents. Moreover, nonessential virulence targets may be less prone to resistance development.",

The sensor is based on a few basic principles and state of the art technology. The wide FOV, high resolution, and compact size are achieved by overlapping fields-of-view onto a single high-resolution detector using holographic technology. Overlapping the fields of small angular sectors in the field of view of a fine sensor permits sharing a single high-resolution focal plane array of a moderate size among sectors. For a given array size it allows to spread the signal in the elevation direction over N times the number of pixels that a sensor with a single sector and the same system field of view would have used. thus creating a system that overcomes the inherent problems of wide field of view systems, namely, low resolution.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Phase I effort, through analysis and continuing simulation, proved the feasibility of improving the accuracy of locating an emitter with an unknown waveform by a method that uses more of the information in the received signals than previous methods.The approach generalizes AOA and TDOA, normally used in triangulation methods, and combines them into an algorithm estimating location directly.  We found a superior method of selecting parameters for times when we are limited in the amount of informationthat can be sent to a central processing location.  We developed a software simulation program to be used for quantitative assessment in typical scenarios.  The method was also shown to be capable of improved location accuracy in the presence of multipathdispersion on each receive path by utilizing the synchronized diversity effect of multiple sensors.  The method can be implemented with small portable location sensors with distributed control.Based on the method validated in Phase I, a complete fieldable prototype system is proposed.  The system uses an ad hoc wireless network for inter-sensor communications and the design is compatible with a transition to a JTRS-type radio. The location ofemitters can be calculated by the user requesting the location and can be distributed for digital map display over the network.  The prototype system will be used to demonstrate performance in controlled tests.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovations Research (SBIR) Phase II project builds on demonstrated and patented new hydrogenation-based processes for producing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers for the semiconductor manufacturing industry. It has been demonstrated that this new techniques can be bonded for improved activation of the surfaces of silicon wafers. The innovation also serves to suppress layer transfer faults. The improvement in yield and the reduction in cost in the SOI production process have also been achieved. The process is expected to scale down to the formation of SOI surface films of thickness well below 0.1 micron. During Phase I, an RF plasma treatment was developed which optimizes the amount of adsorbed activating species on surfaces resulting in an improved layer transfer yield over previous wet chemical activation techniques. The process optimization was based on molecular dynamics simulation of the sub-monolayer hydroxylized surface. In Phase II the simulation-based process design continues with experimental characterization of the resulting probability of the layer transfer faults. The Phase II work plan includes more detailed process design and optimization leading to a characterization of best effort SOI wafers by the venture partners. The impact of the proposed commercialization activity on the existing $10B worldwide silicon starting-wafer industry is potentially huge. The increasing usage of SOI by the leading semiconductor manufacturers is optimistically projected to grow from 1% to 10% of the worldwide silicon market. If successful, a ramp up to commercialization SOI pilot production will begin immediately upon the completion of this Phase II contract",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this proposal is to continue research and development of a cost-effective device that measures linear and rotational head acceleration following impact in sports.  Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) in sports is a significant public health concern.  The biomechanics of head impacts that result in a concussion or other MTBI are not well understood but are widely believed to correlate with head accelerations.  The lack of a system that allows researchers to measure head acceleration during actual play in a large number of individuals is a major obstacle in furthering our understanding of the mechanism of MTBI and its prevention.  A novel algorithm for calculating linear and rotational acceleration of the head was developed and will be incorporated in a miniature accelerometer-based telemetry data acquisition system.  Clinical trials will be performed at two major colleges over the course of a season in men's football and men's and women's hockey.  The trial will be performed in conjunction with ongoing head injury studies that include neuropsychological testing of athletes, and neuropsychological test scores will be analyzed.  The long-term goal of the project is to develop a cost-effective commercially available system for measuring head acceleration for widespread use in sports.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65194      Tau3P, a powerful electromagnetic analysis program recently developed by the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, enables unprecedented detail and accuracy of accelerator component design calculations on massively parallel computers.  However, the complex process of problem setup, job management, and post-processing of results requires the use of a variety of disjoint, difficult-to-use tools that severely limit the utility of Tau3P to the broader accelerator and microwave design communities.  This project will interface Tau3P to an existing analysis package, known as Analyst, that provides comprehensive support for finite-element numerical software, including embedded computer-aided design software, automated meshing, sophisticated visual and numerical post-processing, and optimization capabilities.  In Phase I, a prototype extension to Analyst was created that could write input files for Tau3P and translate output files into an Analyst project database.  The Analyst post-processor was configured to display mesh and field data generated by Tau3P.  A web-based client-server application was also created that could run Tau3P on a remote machine, with support for upload and download of solver-files, and return/display of solver console messages.  In Phase II, further enhancements will allow the model preparation process to be vastly simplified, and its integration into the Analyst system will be improved.  Tau3P also will be augmented with a new solver for unconstrained tetrahedral meshes and a powerful new capability for computing wake potentials on arbitrary beam trajectories.                           Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The analysis package should make robust and accurate time-domain analysis capabilities available to engineers in the telecommunications and computer industries, providing a powerful new way to design broadband hardware.  The Tau3P development also should further the science of numerical analysis, possibly leading to advances in other related fields such as computational fluid dynamics",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In the Phase I program, SKION demonstrated the capability of Negative Sputter Ion Deposition to deposit optical thin films with state-of-the-art properties, specifically ultrasmooth surfaces, high packing density, refractive index close to bulk values, andstability to environmental exposure. In Phase II, we propose to utilize these films to fabricate high-quality, economical optical devices for high energy laser applications. Prototype dielectric mirrors will be delivered which have higher reflectivity,lower loss, and higher laser damage threshold than currently available technology, with lower  projected costs per unit.SKION will accomplish these goals with a threefold program: technology demonstrations in collaboration with two well-renowned laboratories, design and construction of a flexible multilayer deposition system, and fabrication and testing of state-of-the-artdevices. Dielectric mirrors will be fabricated using tantalum oxide and silicon oxide, two of the optical thin film materials demonstrated in Phase I. The target application will be a high reflectance mirror at the YAG wavelength (1.06 microns) with highlaser damage threshold. SKION will meet with the Army to discuss the most desirable configurations and alternate or additional devices to be delivered. The devices developed in the Phase II program will be scaled up for commercial production.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A main goal of SloWave, Inc. is to develop a novel class of sleep-enhancing compounds that, unlike all currently available hypnotics, stimulate slow-wave sleep (SWS), the deepest and most restorative stage of sleep. SloWave plans to develop structural analogs of a natural neuromodulator, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), which is a potent stimulant of SWS, and has a specific newly identified receptor system in the brain. The objective of this Phase II proposal is to synthesize and screen compounds with the most potent effects on SWS. The specific aims are: 1. To test about 50 GHB agonists, identified by binding assays to have affinity for the GHB receptor, for their ability to induce changes in locomotor activity and body temperature, and to later test about 10 of the lead compounds for their effects on EEG sleep-wake states. 2. To test important hypotheses concerning the mechanisms of action of GHB by examining the effects of various GABAergic or dopaminergic antagonists on GHB-induced alterations in behavioral or physiological state. 3. To determine the effect of chronic treatment with GHB on sleep, and to determine if withdrawal from chronic drug exposure leads to sleep disturbances. The completion of these studies will result in: 1. The identification of 2-3 novel compounds that will subsequently be tested for toxicity prior to human Phase I studies. 2. Increased understanding of the mechanisms of action of GHB on sleep information, which is critical for the design of clinical studies. 3. The definition of the effects of chronic GHB treatment on sleep information, which is important for later pre-clinical studies on the chronic effects of our compounds.  The development of GHB related compounds will represent a major breakthrough in the treatment of conditions which involve decreased or abnormal slow-wave sleep, such as aging depression, fibromyalgia and narcolepsy, which together affects many millions of individuals.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: SloWave will develop a novel class of sleep-enhancing compounds acting via the GHB system which, unlike currently available hypnotics, stimulate slow-wave sleep, the deepest and most restorative stage of sleep, and have a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with the maintenance of sleep and a heightened level of alertness upon awakening.  These new compounds will represent a major breakthrough in the treatment of conditions and illnesses which involve disturbed sleep.",

It will do this by facilitating access to, and statistical analysis of original individual-level data from outstanding scientific datasets through the creation of an international CAM Data Archive (CAMDA). The archive will comprise three kinds of machine-readable materials: (1) approximately 30-50 exemplary datasets, fully documented and made compatible with a variety of popular statistical software programs and operating systems; (2) the measurement instruments, questionnaires, and protocols (in machine-readable and searchable PDF format) that correspond to the datasets; and (3) HTML and Adobe-based search and retrieval software to identify those portions of the datasets and measurement instruments relevant to user-specified research questions and keywords. Each archived study will also include a standardized printed and machine-readable User's Guide describing the study, its contents, and important analysis notes. The archive will be easy to use, fast, and efficient. It will serve the widest possible user constituency, health researchers, social scientists, educators, students, and policy makers, and maximize its availability by offering all its products on CD-ROM and as downloadable files on the Internet through Sociometrics' Socionet server.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Prospective users of CAMDA include researchers, health practitioners, policy-makers, educators, students, and other health and social science data consumers.  These groups represent a potential for tens of thousands of individual and institutional sales.  Sociometrics current data archives have sold over $158,000 in total volume, an increase of 40% in the last 9 months of this year.  In light of the value-added features associated with CAMDA, we expect it to match and exceed this pace.",

Because decisions made during the concept definition phase can impact the entire program, accurate LCCestimates are crucial.  However, in highly technical projects such as Military Aerospace Vehicles, obtaining accurate lifecycle estimates is hindered by the complexity of cost relationships and the need to integrate both cost and engineering data.  DuringPhase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of solving this difficulty by creating a prototype tool called PLCC in which complex engineering relationships can be transformed into standardized elements in a WBS.  In Phase II , we will expand this prototypeinto a more general and robust tool called Technical Life Cycle Cost tool (TLCC).  TLCC will include templates for estimating the development, acquisition, operations, and maintenance cost of Military Aerospace Vehicles (MAV) for a variety of differentvehicle concepts and engines. It will also offer extensive optimization possibilities that will include parameter analysis, cost minimization and tradeoff comparisons. The benefit will be more accurate cost predictions that in turn will provide bettersupport for decision making.",

Net shape fully dense metallic parts have been the holy grail of rapid prototyping since its inception. Solidica, Inc. has patented an innovative ultrasonic approach for rapid prototyping of net shape metallic parts using a ribbon feedstock. By combining the use of ultrasonics for layer-by-layer material build up of metallic ribbons with a simple machining head Solidica achieves net shape fully dense metallic components in a fraction of the time and at a lower cost than traditional machining or casting. Extending this proprietary technology to use filament based feedstock rather than ribbon, will enable a complexity of geometry that is currently only achievable for fully dense metal components through investment casting. This innovation has enormous cost saving advantages for production of both complex metallic and bimetallic functional gradient test hardware. There is currently no technology that is readily capable of forming functionally gradient structures for complex geometric shapes.",

The end product will be a series of interactive, multi-media training modules that will effectively marry the best of traditional professional development methods with new and emerging information technologies.     In Phase I, we identified and divided into logical sequential modules, research-based knowledge of reading development and language structure as well as sound instructional practices; we identified the strongest technologies and media for delivering the literacy intervention content and methods; we synthesized the information to design LETRS and produced a prototype training module in phonemic awareness; lastly, we proved that teachers' learning of instructional methods for phonological awareness was as good with CD-based instruction as it was with in-person instruction, but that the best combination of experiences for teachers included CD-based instruction and a facilitator.   In Phase II, the LETRS design blueprint will be revised and refined reflective of the data gathered in Phase I. Using the development processes and software templates created in Phase I, seven of the learning modules for the LETRS course, to include the interactive, multimedia CD-ROMs, Internet communication technologies, facilitated sessions, and other training materials including study guides and case study materials, will be produced.

The material has been trademarked as SOLREX and would be developed into neat sheet foam for thermal protection and noise andweight reduction. Also it shall be developed as foam filled honeycomb core for structural uses such as bulkheads, hatches and scuttles. Additionally, SOLREX would be developed for use as a repair insulation on board ship in a brush or spray-on application.The thermal stability of SOLREX shall be demonstrated to be reliable from -425F to more than +600F. Furthermore, this leading edge material will be tested to verify its low fire, smoke and toxicity (FST), zero flame spread and very low levels of gasemissions when exposed to direct flame. During this Phase II SBIR, Sordal will demonstrate the insulation material at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center or as directed by NAVSEA. After successful testing and measurement, SOLREX will be tested on boardship for sea trials (e.g. aircraft carrier or other class vessel).  Once fully commercialized (Phase III), SOLREX would be a second source, USA based supplier for US Navy contractors to compete with foreign supplied polyimide foams.",

REGAE (regional activity estimation) is a feasible and promising new methodology for estimating fast neuroelectric activity that originates in one or more brain regions of interest (ROls), and has the potential to extend existing functional imaging methods. The REGAE method is based on the combination of imaging and electrophysiological (EEG or MEG) data, using advanced statistical analysis tools. Both spatial resolution and RO1 signal detectability are quantifiable within the REGAE framework, within which an estimator's sensitivity to modeling and measurement errors can be characterized. The overall aim of Phase II is to push forward with theoretical advancement, sensitivity studies, and real-world evaluations of REGAE in order to develop a commercially successful software component that integrates with existing EMSE Suite software. \r \r The intended market areas for REGAE are: (i) basic research in human brain mapping and cognitive neuroscience, (ii) preclinical research in neuropsychiatry and neurology, and, most specifically, (iii) clinical application in presurgical evaluations for intractable epilepsy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Functional imaging techniques are important to brain researchers and clinicians alike because many phenomena cannot be observed by anatomical techniques alone. Among functional imaging methods, only magneto- and electro-encephalography (MEG, EEG, or jointly M/EEG) can noninvasively resolve events with a millisecond time scale. The aim of this work is the development, validation, and commercialization of a detailed, realistic model of electrical current flow in the head, the currents originating from sources within the brain, and measured electrically and/or magnetically on or near the surface of the scalp. 3D finite element models of individual heads will be constructed with the aid of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The finite element method provides the needed flexibility for modeling an asymmetric, anisotropic, and inhomogeneous medium like the head. These subject-specific models may be used as the basis for high-resolution methods for estimating neural activity source location and time course. \r \r The algorithms will be incorporated into prototype software, and the software validated with both simulated and experimental data. The software will comprise a realistic modeling module of our EMSE suite, our PC/Windows-based program suite for analysis and display. The algorithms and resulting software may be used to study both normal brain function, such as measurements in cognitive neuroscience which may be studied with evoked response/event related potentials or spontaneous EEG, and in diseases of the brain, such as the epilepsies, where precise spatial and temporal resolution may be of value for diagnosis and presurgical evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A need exists for continuous monitoring of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in spacecraft/habitat air. HCN, a highly toxic gas generated by burning or smoldering plastics, can provide early warning of spacecraft fires. NASA has established a Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentration (SMAC) of 1 ppm for manned missions exceeding one week. Useful space-borne instruments must satisfy stringent requirements unique to manned missions in space: low power draw, low weight, fully automated operation, self-calibrating, self-checking, and long term, maintenance free operation. The sensors also require an exceptional combination of sensitivity and selectivity: a 1 ppm alarm point requires a detection sensitivity of 100 parts per billion, yet the system must be free of false alarms despite by large concentrations of other species. Southwest Sciences proposes the development of a sensor for hydrogen cyanide based on optical absorption spectroscopy using diode lasers. This approach will meet all of the requirements identified above for space-borne sensors. Two types of diode lasers could be used. Each has a different set of advantages and disadvantages, and the Phase I effort will determine which of the two is best suited to NASA's needs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Many hazardous gases that NASA needs to monitor on and around space vehicles during launch could be detected using mass spectrometers that need operate over only a limited mass range. But, stringent requirements of low weight and low power operation, plus the ability to tolerate high G-forces and excessive vibration prevent the ready adaptation of existing, commercial mass spectrometers to these applications. This Phase I SBIR project successfully tested a novel, compact, inexpensive, low power, time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) for quantitative measurement of hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. The key insight behind our approach is recognizing that a useful TOFMS can be built incorporating a short flight tube that is operated at low energies. Phase I proof-of-principle experiments provide the essential information needed to design and build a prototype instrument that will be delivered to NASA KSC at the end of Phase II. We anticipate that deliverable will meet most of the target parameters specified in the Phase I solicitation: operation between 2 and 40 amu; a measurement dynamic range of 1,000,000; less than 3500 cubic centimeter volume; and, less than 10 kg total weight.",

Unfortunately, there is still a lack of designexperience and dedicated authoring tools allowing course instructors to seamlessly integrate and reuse this type of 3D content in today's education and training applications.  soVoz's approach to developing 3D components not only can provide thesecapabilities, but simplifies the 3D development process as well, thereby allowing domain experts to directly author 3D content without the assistance of professional artists, animators and programmers.  Phase I of the project determined the feasibility ofdeveloping a 3D component framework, runtime and authoring tool enabling the creation of reusable 3D content for Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) environments that is conformant with the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM).   Detaileddesigns were formulated and a 3D component testbed developed for the creation and testing of 3D components.  The testbed not only determined the feasibility of the soVoz approach, but was also used to refine the system design and demonstrate that complex3D content could be created in a manner of minutes.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The specific innovation proposed, tentatively named DYNASCOPE, is an innovative system of microscopy equipment capable of unique sample manipulation and real-time observation. A uniquely designed hollow microscope slide with high manufacturability offers an opportunity to study the effects of capillary forces, magnetic fields, electrokinetic fields, and microscopic hydrodynamics on a wide range of fluids including biological samples. The key element of the system is the hollow slide which interfaces with other modular components, providing novel opportunities to manipulate fluid samples and to observe flows using particle image velocimetry and similar optical techniques. Three sets of endcaps, each specifically designed to accommodate pumps, magnets, or electrodes, offer flexibility, stringent control of the applicable field, and user-friendly interfaces. DYNASCOPE will facilitate video recording of motion in a variety of fluid samples on Earth or in space. Laboratory applications include the study of magnetized particle interactions, electokinetically induced aggregation and coalescence, and flow driven by capillary forces in phase-changing mixtures and porous media. In space research, DYNASCOPE can serve similar purposes, in which the gravity-dependent components of the above phenomena can be studied using the Light Microscopy Module designed for the International Space Stations Fluids Integrated Rack.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         For this Phase II proposal, Space Photonics puts forth highly innovative solutions for multi-access spacecraft clusters using our proposed miniature modular free space laser communications transceiver subsystem.  Our innovation uses MEMs technology todirect and acquire laser crosslink signals. This eliminates the need for the large, power hungry, mechanical gimbals previously required for laser crosslink pointing, acquisition and tracking. Our unique use of MEMs technology will produce a compact, low power design with a wide field of view and extremely high data transfer rates (up to 10 Gbps). Because of the extreme compactness of our design, ourtransceivers can be easily integrated to provide a full 360 azimuth crosslink communications capability. Additionally, our laser crosslink transceiver provides enhanced utility for open architecture implementations, optimized link power budget efficiency,and straightforward modular spacecraft power and data bus interfaces. Our innovative designs and implementation techniques were not possible just a few years ago. However, recent advances in devices and fabrication technology have made the implementationof our innovations not only realizable but also practical and will provide enormous value and functionality to laser crosslink systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The largest error source in validation of NASA's EOS satellite cloud products is the mismatch in sampling volumes between the remote sensors and the in situ cloud probes. The sampling error from the extrapolation of the in situ cloud probe measurement of a few cm3 to the remote sensing measurement of millions of m3 is very large because of the extreme variability of cloud density. The new in situ lidar built in Phase I and tested in cloud on a mountaintop measures the volumetric extinction coefficient in cloud volumes ranging from millions to billions of m3. The in situ lidar differs from a regular lidar in that inside an optically thick cloud the laser pulse is multiply scattered by cloud droplets and the signal measured by the detector is the number of photons returned as a function of time. The amplitude and shape of the returned pulse contain information about the cloud volumetric extinction coefficient at different spatial scales around the instrument and the distance to the cloud boundaries. Phase I proof-of-concept tests conducted in cloud on a mountaintop demonstrated that the time-varying signal measured by the in situ lidar fit exactly the shape of the signal predicted by a physical model. The volumetric extinction coefficients measured over a period of several hours by the in situ lidar agreed in magnitude with local measurements using a cloud droplet probe, although as expected, there was considerable variability in the measurements. In Phase II we will build an airborne in situ lidar and install it on a Learjet research aircraft. The in situ lidar will be compared with microphysical measurements of cloud properties and cloud boundaries collected by the Learjet in various types of clouds.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Efficient design of remote spectral imaging sensors, including the optics and data processing algorithms, depends critically on the availability of well-characterized data that span the full operational space of the sensor.  As it is not practical to spanthis space with field data alone, high-fidelity scene simulations are needed. To address this need, Spectral Sciences, Inc. proposes to develop a hyperspectral/multispectral scene simulator for the UV/visible through thermal infrared (TIR) (~0.4-13mm)regions that accurately treats atmospheric effects and incorporates realistic spectral and spatial variability (clutter) in the surface materials.  In Phase I we successfully demonstrated a novel method to building synthetic imagery with data-based spatialand spectral surface properties, and formulated an efficient Monte Carlo radiation transport method for high-fidelity image simulations covering the full wavelength range of interest.  In Phase II we will fully implement these and other capabilities in aprototype software toolkit and perform extensive validation and analysis with a variety of sensors and data sets.  Phase II and Phase III products will be developed in collaboration with a team of commercial and academic partners that have considerableexperience in remote sensing, image processing, and technical software development.",

The atmospheric variables needed for the correction (water vapor and ozone column amounts, and aerosol optical properties) may be retrieved from a radiometer located in the vicinity of the remotely sensed scene of interest. The radiometer-retrieved information will significantly improve atmospheric correction accuracy, most notably by taking the guesswork out of selecting a suitable aerosol modelPhase I featured novel MODTRAN-based algorithms and tools for analyzing shadow band radiometer measurements and porting the results to the FLAASH atmospheric correction algorithm. Key accomplishments include demonstration of radiometer data conditioning for continuous daytime retrievals, an aerosol parameterization that extrapolates well into the IR, analysis of radiometer data, and demonstration of complete, end-to-end atmospheric retrieval and correction using simulated radiometer and HSI data. In Phase II, an integrated software toolkit will be prototyped and validated against new HSI/MSI field and archival data. In Phase III, the toolkit will be commercialized and integrated with MODTRAN5 and ENVI/FLAASH products under development with our commercial partner, Research Systems, Inc.",

TLD devices presently used for this purpose only provide exposure information\r at monthly intervals.

Electronic\r dosimeters overcome this problem by providing real time information; however,\r presently available devices are bulky and inconvenient to use. The core\r technology of this project is a novel radiation sensor, with a demonstrated\r dynamic range of 10 microR/hour to more than 10,000 R/hour, covering natural\r background exposure to severe radiation accidents. Importantly, this sensor\r only requires 30 microwatts of power to operate, allowing 3-5 years of\r continuous operation from a single watch battery. The commercial product based\r on this sensor will be contained in a package about the size of a TLD badge. A\r digital readout on the device will provide real time information on the current\r dose rate and the total accumulated dose. In addition, the monitored individual\r will be warned of excessive dose rates by an alarm within the device.",

The instrument utilizes a disposable cartridge that essentially eliminates the high maintenance, training, and operating costs associated with flow cytometry. Novel fluidics increase potential throughput to several orders of magnitude faster than conventional flow cytometers, while decreasing manufacturing costs by orders of magnitude. Flow cytometers provide the underpinnings for diagnostics in many fields ? hematology, genetics screening, tissue engineering, drug screening, genomic and proteonomic research, cancer, AIDs, etc. The vast majority of the diagnostics tests using flow cytometry are not routinely available to the general public because of their cost and complexity. This technology takes the cost, skill, and complexity out of flow cytometry, and for the first time allows point-of-care testing. Underserved communities, rural locations, and third world countries could have direct access to many more diagnostic tests. Clinical and basic research will benefit from inexpensive and continuous access to a powerful analytical tool. This ultrahigh throughput flow cytometer is ideally suited to the low gravity environment due to its small size, low power consumption, and gravity independence.",

Withvarious propulsion system concepts being generated and proposed for KV divert and attitude control systems (DACS), there is a need for an accurate, graphical DACS Modeling Tool to expedite the evaluation of KV propulsion systems. An extensive search wasperformed surrounding the Phase I effort, yielding no other DACS tools available to meet this need. The initial development of an innovative, graphical-user-interface (GUI) model was undertaken during the Phase I to assist MDA in evaluating and validatingsolid DACS systems. SRS is now prepared to incrementally develop the Phase I DACS Modeling Tool into a fully capable, user-friendly, KV propulsion modeling tool, to ultimately enable lighter, faster, more reliable and less expensive missile defense killvehicles and interceptors. The modeling options will be expanded to include non-traditional solid DACS systems, liquid DACS systems, gel DACS systems, and cold-gas thrusters. The DACS Modeling Tool will also be integrated with our existing interceptordesign code to optimally size the booster propulsion stages, resulting in a complete interceptor modeling and sizing tool.",

Under the Phase-1 effort, the preliminary work to demonstrate the feasibility of the SOLEX concept was accomplished. The intent of the proposed Phase-II effort is to develop a flight-level design for a SOLEX plasma generator, for electrodynamic tether systems, and fabricate an Engineering Unit test device that is appropriate for flight validation. The SOLEX will operate directly off of the tether-generated high-voltage (requiring no conditioned power or control electronics) and will eliminate the need for high-pressure gas containers, pressure regulators, plumbing and valves?required by present state-of-the-art Hollow Cathode devices. These are significant improvements over current state-of-the-art contactors that impinge heavily on spacecraft resources. Based on available flight data and Phase-I tests, current capacity can range from a few milli-amps to several amps. By nature of its design, the SOLEX should not be sensitive to contamination and should have essentially unlimited restart capability?both are issues with state-of-the-art contactors. Moreover, the simplicity of the design concept suggests that flight devices will be relatively inexpensive.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Acetaminophen and NSAIDs have been used routinely for treatment of pain and/or fever. This dual action is sometimes contraindicated. In many instances, pain needs to be controlled without masking symptomatic fever (e.g., during the postoperative period). These drugs can cause hepatotoxicity, particularly after ingestion of large doses or from chronic use (especially when liver function has been compromised), which can lead to death. We are exploring a series of new and proprietary derivatives of acetaminophen that have good pharmacological potency and little hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic, or antipyretic effects. In preliminary studies, the initial compounds demonstrated high analgesic activity free from antipyretic activity and hepatotoxicity. In Phase I, we further characterized these initial compounds and several other analogs/derivatives and identified a lead candidate drug. We will further test and develop this drug in Phase II for treating postoperative pain and for other analgesic treatments where acetaminophen is contraindicated. We will also use a combination of in vitro and in vivo models to evaluate additional analogs and derivatives of the Phase I lead candidate drug. We will choose second-generation candidates based on efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and toxicity evaluations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Future NASA missions cover a diverse set of requirements from Earth Observing constellations Flying in Formation to Scientific Observations using multiple tethers. Each spacecraft will have unique design specifications on actuators, sensors, dynamics, control and flight software. Traditionally, these spacecraft simulations have been divided into files, modules or classes which are compiled and linked to form a monolithic simulation application. This static approach requires re-compilation or re-linking for each different spacecraft. Star Technologies along with our Team Member Microsoft Corporation proposes to develop a COM+, Component Object Model, spacecraft simulation architecture that will enable the User to build COM components that can be assembled into a spacecraft simulation without the need for re-compiling or re-linking. The advantages of using COM components result directly from their ability to dynamically plug-into and unplug-from a spacecraft simulation. The COM simulation architecture will provide for rapid assembly via COM components that represent the environment, sensors, actuators, dynamics, and control which may function as distributed processes across networks. And since COM is language independent, the COM+ architecture will enable re-use of previously developed FORTRAN and C programs or routines. The resulting COM+ simulation architecture will be demonstrated on a Tether and a Formation Flying configuration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project will provide people diagnosed with cardiovascular disease with a package of two documentary-style videotapes, two booklets, and an interactive web module, that stresses the importance of self-management and to motivate them to do so. The Phase I results showed that people with CVD felt that these materials would be useful and would use the materials themselves. Equally significant were the results from the evaluation with health professionals, who were very enthusiastic about the materials and felt that the content was clear and accurate. As a result of Phase I research, one video/booklet set will target women and the other will target men. The videos will show the lives of people who are successfully self-managing their CVD and will target the viewer's expectancies of self-management and their self-efficacy of performing it. The booklet will outline self-management information and resources. The interactive web module, which will be licensed to existing web sites, fills a gap left by most web resources for people with CVD - management of stress and awareness of depression. It will allow the user to track these conditions that can have a profound effect on their CVD. It will also deliver information about latest CVD research specific to the needs and interests of the user, based on their profile, and allow the formation of an on-line community via bulletin boards and chats. \r \r In Phase II, the videotapes, booklets, and web module will be produced from the final creative plans developed from Phase I research. The rough-cuts of the videos, rough drafts of the booklet, and beta version of the web module will be reviewed by our Board of Advisors. After feedback from the advisors is incorporated, the materials will be tested through a number of focus groups. After the final editing and identity production are complete, the materials will be tested using a quasi-experimental control group pretest/posttest design. In Phase III, we will approach service organizations and clinics to distribute the package. Using contacts established in Phase I, and other projects serving the needs of persons with CVD, we have working relationships with many organizations, health care facilities, and pharmaceutical companies who would join in this promotional distribution effort.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65549      Conventional duct systems in houses have serious deficiencies.  Usually, they are located in very hot or very cold attics with little insulation to protect them, and often they have excessive leaks and construction-caused defects.  These problems result in energy losses, widely fluctuating indoor comfort conditions, and the transport of air-borne contaminants from unconditioned to conditioned spaces.  This project will address these problems by developing a prefabricated whole-house array of thermoformed plastic ductwork for integration within roof trusses and under insulation layers.  Pre-fabricated plastic ductwork can be used in conventional attic configurations as well as basements and crawlspaces.   Phase I investigated the ductwork layout and materials, then designed, built, and tested a full-scale prototype thermoformed duct system.  It was demonstrated that large parts using thermoforming can be fabricated easily and duct air leakage can be virtually eliminated.  Phase II will develop modular ductwork and mold designs; customize the thermoforming technology; build whole-house duct systems; and install and test entire ductwork systems in the field.                Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The proposed innovation could revolutionize how home heating/cooling distribution systems are configured and installed, and could dramatically improve their performance and cost-effectiveness.  If 20% of the nations homes adopted this system, a savings of 1.3 billion Watt-hours of electricity per year would result.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"Chemical oxygen iodine lasers are efficient, scalable, and have a proven ability to generate weapons class laser power.  To support the future high power COIL programs, technology improvements must be realized to increase performance, efficiency, andchemical operating range, and thus more easily meet the overall system requirements, such as for the ABL EDM phase.  In particular the SOG performance with mixed base BHP must be augmented to allow operation through a wider molarity range and at higher BHPtemperature to reduce magazine size and weight.  Innovative methods for improving the COIL efficiency by increasing singlet oxygen output, reducing singlet oxygen losses, removing water vapor, reducing internal fluid losses and degradation, and reducingwater carryover from the SOG will further improve high power COIL performance.The proposed program will develop several innovative concepts and design an optimized SOG with a water vapor trap and other innovative features that will increase singlet oxygen and reduce water vapor at the laser cavity.  Using the SOG flow/chemistry codedeveloped by STI, the innovative configurations and cold trap fluids will be developed into a first generation design and test device.  Flow simulation and laser tests will be used to characterize performance, provide data to upgrade analyses andconfiguration, and verify performance of this innovative SOG hardware.  The proposed program will develop a proven fir",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65179    Quadrupole focusing magnets for the Next Linear Collider will require magnetic centerline stability of <1 micron when fields are adjusted by 20% for beam-based alignment, a requirement that cannot be easily satisfied with existing electromagnets or permanent magnets.  This project will demonstrate the suitability of a patent-pending, permanent magnet, multipole beamline optic design, with remotely variable magnetic field strength and independent centerline adjustment, for the Next Linear Collider and other potential users with a cost-competitive and reliable device.  In Phase I, a simple laboratory test assembly was used to demonstrate a centerline stability of 0.1 micron over 24 hours and 0.4 micron over two weeks as the field strength was adjusted by 20%.  Active centerline control was also demonstrated, and various actuator schemes were developed to reduce costs and improve radiation resistance.  In Phase II, a prototype Next Linear Collider quadrupole will be developed.                             Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Multipole optical elements, such as quadrupoles, sextupole, and octopoles, are used in all accelerator systems, including research, medical, and industrial accelerators, and synchrotron storage rings.  The adjustable multipole PM elements should have the advantage of eliminating the need for high current power supplies and cooling water with significant capital and operating cost savings.  Also, the PM design is inherently compact and can be used where conventional EMs cannot fit.",

Radar technology supports the development of systems capable of addresing multiple missions.  However, existing waveform design approaches donot permit the accomplishment of these multiple tasks at the same time.  This Phase II efort will apply the evolutionary computation approach for waveform optimization to a diverse set of multi-mission concepts.   Evolutionary computation searches the solution space through the use of simulated evolution.  The fittest individuals (waveform suites) tend to reproduce and survive to the next generation, thus improving successive generations.   Multi-mission radar concepts are possible addressing some or all of the following missions: (1) AMTI search, track, identification and handoff to interceptor, (2) GMTI search, track, target recognition, and handoff, (3)Ballistic missile defense,(4)Radar imaging and FOPEN.  This evolutionary computation approach will optimize waveforms for any multi-mission radar concept.",

Based on a combination of mathematical techniques for nonparametric branch cut identification and adaptive filtering and control theory, our methodspromise to provide greatly enhanced adaptive optics compensator performance. Scintillation, the turbulence-induced fluctuation of image intensities, is widely regarded as a major problem for adaptive optics systems. The methods we propose herein providethe potential to mitigate significantly the effects of scintillation, thus enhancing adaptive optics performance. We also propose innovative control concepts for deformable mirror actuation. Collaborating with scientists and engineers at UCLA, MZA, andAFRL, we will use wave propagation simulations data and data collected in tests at Lincoln Laboratory's ACL facility to score the performance of these algorithms. Continuing our partnership with Boeing-SVS, the leader in systems engineering for opticalsystems for ABL and other weapon systems, will allow us to leverage the results obtained in this effort into commercial hardware systems in a most efficient and cost-effective manner.",

Central to our pragmatics-based approach is the idea thatmultiple perspectives on story novelty can overcome errors made by any single perspective.  Committee-based methods arbitrate these multiple classification viewpoints.  Category models are constructed semi-automatically under user guidance to capturestereotypically co-occurring activities within broad categories of topics.  These models are used to generate predictions about the future content of news stories and assist in customizing the system to a particular task domain.  Scalability is ensuredthrough a combination of techniques, including temporal feature compression and granularity control.  Our Phase I research and development of a proof-of-concept prototype demonstrated the feasibility and utility of TOPIC's pragmatics-based approach andprovides a solid foundation for a scalable, fully functional Phase II implementation of a first story detection and topic tracking system.",

We propose a new approach to scientific knowledge generation and amplification that draws on the synergy amongst multiple distinct technologies that have individually proved to be extremely valuable in knowledge management. We intend to enliven the knowledge representation and assimilation technique called Concept Mapping with novel information retrieval and natural language processing technologies. In particular, we propose to utilize recent advances in automated thesaurus development and novel query construction techniques to semi-autonomously fuel the concept mapping process. The resulting system, Farsight, will act as an integrated knowledge elicitation, assimilation, codification, and sharing device. Farsight will benefit NASA by enhancing the ability of their scientists and engineers (and those of their partners) to better understand new and/or challenging concepts and push the scientific envelope.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Continuing advances in computer networking, distributed computing, and the standardization and exchange of medical information make it possible for clinicians to retrieve increasing amounts of patient data on-line.  However, accessing upwards of hundredsof pages of data for each patient can overwhelm the clinician who may have just a few minutes before and during each 15 or 20-minute patient visit to review the patient's records.  To help clinician review patient data more effectively, we proposed todevelop an Intelligent Patient Data Review Assistant (IPDRA) software system that selects an initial subset of the patient's records that are of greatest relevance to the patient visit, presents information to the clinician in the most effective manner,and responds to additional requests for other information about the patient.  During Phase I, we worked with clinicians on our project team and at the Army to determine system requirements, develop a high-level design, and design and prototype mock-ups ofinteractive, patient data views.  For Phase II, we propose to develop and evaluate an operational prototype that convincingly demonstrates IPDRA's usefulness and feasibility.",

Although biomedical device technology has made progress, a surface that is completely biocompatible for long term use has not been achieved. The clinical means to prevent thrombosis still requires the co-administration of anti-coagulants, predominantly heparin. STS Biopolymers is developing polymer (MEDI-COAT/TM) coatings containing heparin complexes for rendering vascular catheters anti- thrombogenic for extended periods. In the Phase I portion of this project we measured the loaded amount on, the extraction rates from, and the in vitro anti-coagulant activity of heparin from prototype MEDI-COAT/TM coated catheters. A MEDI-COAT/TM catheter demonstrating prolonged heparin extraction was then evaluated in vitro. We will continue the product development of an anti-thrombogenic catheter in Phase II by further characterizing and optimizing the MEDI- COAT/TM technology used in Phase I. Polymer coating formulations will be modified to achieve optimal coating structure and performance. Solution stability coating morphology, and coating integrity will be evaluated.. For prototype formulations, elution testing in vitro and in vivo will determine the performance effects of formulation changes. Catheter coating parameters affecting product quality will also be optimized. MEDI-COAT/TM coatings with sustained anti-coagulant activity will proceed to clinical evaluation in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: (provided by the applicant) Scintillator-based CCD-based digital intraoral radiography systems are beginning to replace x-ray film and associated processing equipment in dentists? offices. Foremost on the list of advantages are large reductions in patient x-ray exposure, the ability to perform direct image manipulation, and remote information transmission. However, these systems suffer from a significant reduction in image due to the x-ray light converter that limits the clinician?s ability to diagnose such diseases as periodontitis, caries, and certain oral tumors. This fact is severely limiting acceptance of digital x-ray imaging in dental practices at this time.  The Phase I program demonstrated the feasibility of a new concept of producing intraoral digital x-ray sensors. A variety of novel digital imaging arrays were designed, fabricated and tested which exhibited double the dose efficiency and more than double the spatial resolution compared to standard digital x-ray intraoral systems. The results indicated that it will be possible to produce intraoral x-ray sensors with over 80 percent detective quantum efficiency for 70 kVp x-rays, and limiting spatial resolution greater than 22 lp/mm.  During the Phase II, we shall complete the development of the new intraoral imaging sensor based on a new direct x-ray imaging technology and use it with actual pre-clinical samples to quantitatively compare results to existing systems. This work will involve CMOS sensor design and x-ray screen converter fabrication to produce the novel sensors required for intraoral imaging procedures.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The market for digital intraoral imaging systems is estimated to be in excess of $10 billion worldwide. A low-cost, compact intraoral X-ray system with significantly higher image quality than current systems provide will find widespread acceptance in dental operatories.",

These cryocoolers will employ low-cost and reliable linear-motor, gas-bearing compressors operating in the range of 40 to 60 Hz with electrical inputs on the order of 100 W or lower. In the expander section, each stage will comprise a regenerator and pulse-tube in a u-tube configuration fitted to an inertance-tube phase shifter and reservoir volumeAchieving high efficiencies at these relatively low cooling powers will require special care to minimize thermal losses. Integral with the cryocooler design, Sunpower proposes to investigate the cryo-package design, including the physical dimensions of the likely cooled device as well as the optimal insulation strategy. To maximize overall system efficiency, intermediate-stage cooling will anchor radiation shielding at each intermediate-stage temperature, where radiant heat loading can be removed more efficiently.This project will employ the Sage pulse-tube design software (Gedeon Associates) for the multi-stage cryocooler modeling as well as the overall cryo-package optimization.",

Currently, Nb3Sn is the only commercially available superconductor capable of operating at such high fields.  Powder-In-Tube (PIT) Nb3Sn conductor has shown attractive performance and good strain resistance.  However, cost is a major drawback, particularly powder costs.  This program seeks to reduce the cost of the PIT process.  This project will investigate alternative powder fabrication routes for NbSn2 powder for eventual application in PIT Nb3Sn conductor development.  These alternative processing routes have the promise of producing high quality powder in a single step and at greatly reduced cost.  In Phase I, alternative processing routes to produce NbSn2 powder were explored through changes in reaction heat treatment parameters and choice of raw material.  Samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy to determine degree of NbSn2 formation.  The indirect melt diffusion and chopped niobium wire processes were found to be practical, scaleable, and cost efficient processes by which to manufacture phase-pure NbSn2.  In Phase II, these processes will be scaled up to handle production size lots.  Ultimately PIT Nb3Sn conductor will be fabricated, and its superconducting properties will be tested and optimized.

The superconductors must also be cost effective so that the magnets, and hence the accelerators, will be economically viable.  This project will develop a process for improving the current carrying capacity of the superconducting filaments within the Nb3Sn superconducting material by introducing a strong oxide-former and oxygen to form sites that will pin the grain boundaries and hence the fluxoids.  The Nb filaments will be replaced by Nb1at.%Zr and the properties of this material, with and without additional oxygen, will be compared with each other and with the conventional          Nb-based material.  Phase I demonstrated that casting the alloy with a significant amount of oxygen led to a material that was difficult to fabricate.  Fabricability was improved when commercially available Nb1at.%Zr was used to remove most of the oxygen from the Zr containing alloy.  It was determined that the ideal stage for the introduction of oxygen is late in the process to maintain maximum fabricability.  Phase II will explore various methods of introducing oxygen to maintain maximum fabricability.  Oxygen will be introduced into the copper and then used to internally oxidize the Nb1at.%Zr before the Sn reacts to form Nb3Sn.  The properties of material containing commercial Nb1at.%Zr with various levels of oxygen will be compared with those of material made from pure Nb.                        Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Lower cost superconductors should reduce the cost of MRI machines and expand the range of applications for MRI, a billion dollar industry.

        "abstract": "Abstract         65706        Negative-electron-affinity (NEA) photocathodes, which produce polarized electrons, are a vital component of electron accelerators.  For the next Linear Collider (NLC), the polarized electron beam intensity must be at least 20 times greater than that produced by strained GaAs, used in the current generation of photocathodes.  Additionally, the degree of electron polarization needs to be increased beyond the 75% currently attainable, and intrinsic materials properties must be tailored to improving the surface charge limit. This project will develop a new generation of photocathodes capable of yielding intense, highly polarized electron beams for use in advanced electron colliders.  A strained-superlattice, formed from altering layers of GaAs and GaAsP approximately ten monolayers thick, will be utilized.  In Phase I, the development of a new superlattice structure using GaAs and GaAsP was begun.  Record breaking 86% polarization with 1% quantum efficiency was achieved and theoretical considerations indicated that >90% polarization should be achievable.    Phase II will further explore the superlattice parameter space, optimize the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth condition, and develop the superlattice characterization techniques to predict charge and polarization performance.  The goal of Phase II is to achieve 90% or greater polarization photocathodes and develop a manufacturing process.              Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A highly efficient polarized electron source should find use in experimental research at SLAC and other electron collider facilities.  As much as 25.6% increase in beam line efficiency may be achieved due to high polarization and beam current, leading to a significant increase in physics opportunities.  Other areas of application include magnetic imaging research, surface analysis, quantum computing and cryptography",

The electrostatic means, for preventing coalescence in the drop cloud, will be developed further. Development of cooling means for solidification will be completed. Specific industry quality control standards and testing will be applied to qualify the monosphere product. Finally, a refined analysis of cost of manufacture, and a complete business plan will be produced. The outcome expected from this project is the technology base for the commercial, large-scale production of monospheres.

The data were compared to thickness measurements done on similar films by SEM and Auger spectroscopy analysis done at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.   The Phase II proposed workis aimed at creating standards that can be used to identify the chemical and physical properties of boron nitride and silicon nitride layers by making measurements with the Filmetrics unit .    In addition, Phase II will implement a computer control systemon the bolt-to-bolt   interface coating reactor that was developed by Synterials prior to the Phase I program. The control system was designed under the Phase I program.    A third focus for the Phase II program is to establish the influence ofoff-standard interface coatings on the properties of composites.  The program team includes COI Ceramics, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A novel training methodology that takes advantage of automation?s potential as a high-speed decision aid and the strengths of human pattern recognition and conditioning is proposed. The methodology applies optimal control theory to solve for a vehicle?s trajectory and the required control inputs. A preview of the commanded input suite is displayed to the pilot, which will dynamically update as the vehicle state changes in time. Using this and other innovative training displays, the pilot should be able to execute numerous maneuvers previously considered outside the operational envelope, in addition to performing ?standard? emergencies with a high degree of control consistency and accuracy. The preview display?s function can be extended to serve as an on-board pilot cueing aid. This methodology can be incorporated in flight simulators to train pilots across a range of platforms. The initial target application will be for rotorcraft autorotation, a particularly challenging and accident-prone multi-axis maneuver. Phase I demonstrated the concept?s feasibility in the rotorcraft autorotation domain. Phase II will focus on practical application and demonstration of the concept for rotorcraft autorotation training and its expansion to other flight vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Reconfigurable Computing (RC) is a technology in which the behavior of a processing system is changed by altering the hardware, rather than the software. This is achieved though the use of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).  RC is useful when a highdegree of both performance and flexibility is needed, and especially when size, weight, or power constraints preclude use of dedicated components for separate functions.  The recent development of high-density, rad-hard COTS FPGAs means that RC now has thepotential to be used in spaceborne applications.  SFC is currently developing an RC tool suite, called DERC (Development Environment for Reconfigurable Computing), which includes both hardware and software to support development of  RC applications.RIFTSS will extend the capabilities of the DERC tools to include extensive support for fault tolerance.  The DERC API and logic libraries will be extended to include fault tolerant functions, including configuration scrubbing, redundancy, voting, etc.  TheDERC Debug Tool will be modified to allow deliberate fault insertion into a design under test.  The RIFTSS tools will be tested by using them to implement a real-world, fault tolerant application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In current Air Force operations, mission planning data is generated using a ground-based system, and is then hand carried to the aircraft shortly before takeoff.  To allow more time for the mission planning operations, the Air Force would like to be ableto use wireless data transmission to transfer this data.  SFC proposes to develop a Remote Consolidated Data Loader (RCDL) to meet this need.  The RCDL will use a COTS wireless technology to transfer data from the Mission Planning System (MPS) to theaircraft.  During Phase I, SFC has developed a system concept heavily based on COTS components.  One key component is the Harris SecNet-11 secure wireless LAN device.  This device, soon to receive NSA approval, combines a Type I encryption processor withwireless LAN functionality.  RCDL uses RF amplifiers to extend the range of this device to the required 2-5 miles.  SFC will deliver a  working prototype RCDL at the end of Phase II.  Also during Phase II the RCDL will be integrated with the WIRED ATDbeing developed by AFRL/IFSC.  The RCDL system will be flight-tested during Phase II as an adjunct to the WIRED ATD, aboard a Combat Talon I aircraft.",

Especially for the forthcoming Space Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS)-Low low earth orbit constellation, post-pass operations involve myriad data flows,resource dependencies, time constraints, situational changes, and requests for constellation services.  The SBIRS-Low crew is in need of computer assistance to operate in this dynamic environment.  The computer entities capable of providing this assistanceare software intelligent agents.  Additionally, introducing computer assistance necessitates crews training with the agents to maximize the human-computer interactions.  To address both of these issues, SYTRONICS, and our subcontractor--Ball Aerospace,propose to develop intelligent associates capable of both training crew members before they perform duty, and assisting them at their duty workstations.  We will capitalize on our expertise in Distributed Mission Training for Space (DMT-S), intelligentagent development, and applications of knowledge management to build a proof-of-concept agent-enabled SBIRS-Low workstation emulator.  Our approach involves building agents focused on individual aspects of post-pass operations that work in tandem.

Although the methods of measuring and cancelingairborne noise are well understood, SYTRONICS hopes to extendthis approach to air-cancellation of bone-conducted noise.  Thiswill involve developing methods for measuring bone-conductednoise in the cochlea, cancellation of bone-conducted noise withan air-conducted signal, combining air- and bone-conductedcanceling signals as well as communications signals in a non-interfering fashion.  SYTRONICS will package the ABCNRSelectronics in a compact, survivable, easily manufactured, andcomfortable production system design.  When embedded incomplimentary passive protection measures, ABCNRS will providethe Navy with OSHA-acceptable hearing protection for its carrierdeck, aircrews, and other sailors during extended exposure tohigh-intensity noise.BENEFITS: Successful deployment of ABCNRS will significantly reduce the hearing losses being experienced by carrier deck hands and Government contractors working shipboard.  Additionally, ABCNRS can improve communications on thecarrier deck as well as for aircrews in certain high-noise exposure maneuvers.  The potential savings in mission effectiveness and reduced disability claims will pay for the system very quickly.",

The new cathode material, consisting of a doped lithiated metal oxide/nitride composite that is capable of reversibly incorporating and releasing lithium, will be inexpensive and have higher charge storage capacity, higher power, and better thermal stability compared to conventional oxide cathode materials.  Phase I developed a scaleable synthesis method to produce the low-cost cathode materials.  The cathode material was shown to have the combined features of high charge storage capacity, excellent rate capability, and good temperature stability.  Phase II will systematically optimize the composition and microstructure of the material, scale up the material synthesis, and demonstrate a power density and a high-temperature performance superior to the conventional oxide cathode.  Phase II will also fabricate prototype Li-ion cells for evaluation by potential customers.                   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new cathode material should lead to a lithium rechargeable battery for hybrid electric vehicles with significantly improved fuel efficiency and cleanness, and should find broad application in batteries for portable electronics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop advanced carbon electrode materials for ultracapacitors. Presently, ultracapacitor voltages are limited to 2.3 - 2.7 V/cell. New carbonaceous electrode materials are expected to increase cell potential limits to >3.6 V. Given the quadratic dependence of energy density on cell potential, these materials will increase ultracapacitor energy storage by >100%. The increased cell potential will reduce device size and cost by reducing the number of cells required to attain a given voltage rating. Phase II will demonstrate that these materials can withstand extended charge/discharge cycling to high voltage. A scalable process will be developed to produce the new carbon electrode materials. Prototype ultracapacitors will be produced to support customer demonstrations. The commercial potential of this project is for ultracapacitors that are used in portable electronic devices, power conditioning (UPS), and electromechanical actuators. Additional applications include hybrid electric and conventional vehicles to service intermittent high power loads (e.g. regenerative braking, engine start, electromechanical valves, and electric power steering).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inadequately treated pain is an important       issue for healthcare as patients demand better care and organizations such as        the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations focus on pain      management. Studies indicate a significant undertreatment of pain in                 hospitalized patients, residents of long-term care facilities, and in patients       at the end of life. The elderly, young, and minorities are at particular risk.       Pain assessment, a critical component of pain management, is a complex ongoing       task requiring good patient-provider communication skills, which are difficult       to teach. PARIS (Pain Assessment via Role-play Internet Simulation) is an            innovative tool that addresses this training need. Phase I successfully              produced the Fundamentals of Pain Assessment, a multimedia tutorial that also        enables learners to interact with \"patients\" via voice-recording role-plays.         Learners unanimously agreed that PARIS is useful and engaging, and that the          simulated role-plays are an excellent way to practice needed communication           skills. Phase II will expand on Phase I, producing a series of modules that          address additional pain assessment topics (e.g. types and dimensions of pain)        and the skills and knowledge particular to specific patient populations (e.g.        elderly, and children). PARIS will provide healthcare institutions with a            comprehensive program to assist in pain assessment training.                          PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: There is a large market for PARIS including hospitals,  clinics, long-term facilities, and medical and nursing schools.  There are several potential  marketing partners including companies that provide healthcare education over the Internet,  medical publishing companies, organizations with educational services (e.g., JCAHO), and  pharmaceutical companies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this project is to design, develop, and validate a computerized assessment tool of early reading development called Continuous Monitoring of Early Reading Skills (CMERS). CMERS will foster a healthier society by enhancing kindergarten and first-grade teachers abilities to provide quality early reading instruction. CMERS will assist teachers to better determine instructional needs of specific children on an ongoing basis, and to monitor individual growth as instruction is delivered. Presently, no software is available for continuous monitoring of early reading skills. In Phase I of this Fast- Track application we will (a) develop a bank of items assess each of three critical domains of early reading -- phonemic awareness, alphabetic knowledge and skills, and fluency in reading connected text; (b) develop software for the test of reading fluency; and (c) conduct 2 experiments to assess psychometric qualities of the measures. Data collected will be analyzed to establish item difficulty; confirm that each item is significantly related to the construct being assessed; and to confirm that the multiple-choice format required by computer administration ranks children in the same way as standard examiner- administered assessment in both absolute level of performance, and in rate of growth over time. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The CMERS product will be published by Pro-Ed, an internationally recognized publisher of testing materials. Pro-Ed anticipates that the CMERS product will become an important tool for monitoring K-1 reading development, used by professionals both nationally and internationally. Skills tracked by CMERS are ones identified as critical in the report \"Teaching Children to Read\" which is being disseminated by the NICHD and USOE.",

To maximize its potential for integration into the structure of elementary school education, the program was developed for use in elementary school core subjects - science, math, and language arts. Separate age- and grade-appropriate programs have been designed for 4th and 5th grades. Science and math activities teach skills in a manner that also reinforces beliefs that drug use and fighting are both rare and unacceptable. Language arts activities reinforce idealism and a belief in a positive future. Activities reinforce perceptions that high-risk behaviors do not fit with desired lifestyles. Classroom teachers implement a behavior management strategy, the All Stars Challenge, based on Kellam's Good Behavior Game. Student teams establish standards for getting along with each other. Teams observe and provide feedback to each other in a process that promotes positive social interaction. During Phase II, specific additions to the program (videotapes for training teachers and students about the All Stars Challenge and an Internet-based language arts activity) will be completed. All Stars, Jr. will be tested in an independently evaluated randomized field trial. Twenty middle schools and feeder elementary schools will be assigned either to receive All Stars, Jr. or to serve as treatment-as-usual controls. The All Stars Core program will be delivered to all students in the 6th grade. Students will be administered pretest and posttest surveys annually in 4th, 5th, and 6th grades. Surveys will assess targeted mediators in all grades and will assess alcohol, tobacco, marijuana and inhalant use in the 6th grade. Main effects and mediating effects analyses will be completed. A case study in which classes will be observed will be completed. A measurement sub-study will examine the degree to which measures designed for elementary school children map onto conceptually-related items designed for middle school children.",

Initial\r tasks to be completed include: (1) refining the curriculum and Internet program\r based on the results of Phase I; (2) creating an instruction manual for college\r and university faculty who may be teaching the course; and (3) collecting and\r editing chapters for a book of readings (online and hard-copy versions) that\r will reflect the research of experts in the field of college alcohol abuse and\r supplement the course curriculum and unit activities. Once these developmental\r tasks are completed, a usability study will be conducted, and if necessary,\r modifications to the course will be made. During the second year of the study,\r an independently evaluated, randomized field trial will be implemented.\r Approximately 1,000 students at a Southeastern university will be randomly\r assigned to either receive the course early in the fall semester or to serve as\r wait-list controls (i.e., they will receive the course after the completion of\r the immediate posttest survey and the three- and six-month follow-up surveys).\r The results of this study have the potential to inform us about the\r effectiveness of targeting research-based mediators in a format that is almost\r universally available to college students, distance learning via the Internet.\r This course has the potential to improve the way college alcohol abuse\r prevention efforts are implemented, evaluated, and disseminated.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Technology Applications, Inc. is proposing to develop a unique evacuated microsphere insulation (MSI) panel that is over twice as effective as polyurethane foam insulation in a one-atmosphere environment and approaches multilayer insulation performance in a vacuum environment. The MSI is rugged, easily applied to cryogenic transfer lines, and not subject to degradation from environmental exposure or thermal cycling. This insulation system will enable the effective distribution and transfer of cryogens over long distances; it is a promising candidate for reusable launch vehicles, space applications, and low-pressure atmospheric applications, such as cryogenic storage and transfer for Mars missions.The MSI consists of microsphere filled panels that are vacuum tight and can be configured to fit any symmetrical shape. The microspheres provide structural support for the vacuum shell while reducing radiation heat transfer by reflection and scattering. Gaseous conduction is greatly reduced by evacuating to <10E-2 torr, and solid conduction is minimized because the glass microspheres make only point contact with each other. The Phase I study will demonstrate the feasibility of the MSI through design, analysis, and the fabrication and testing of candidate panels. During the Phase II development program, representative MSIs will be fabricated and rigorously tested under operational conditions",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Technology Applications, Inc. is proposing to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a low-temperature cryocooler (LTCC) that is reliable, has high efficiency and low vibration, is lightweight and compact, and has variable load capability. This system uses a Stirling or pulse tube cryocooler operating at 70 K as a precooler and an expansion-engine-based cold stage. Operating temperatures below 6 K can easily be achieved with Carnot efficiencies greater than 5%. The extraordinary high efficiency is due to the incorporation of a unique expansion engine design that is enabled through application of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology. The development of the MEMS expander assembly and its integrated electronics will revolutionize low-temperature cooling. It greatly increases Carnot efficiency, reducing input power, lowering cost, and providing consistency of performance. Using MEMS fabrication techniques, the LTCC can be made in large quantities with low production costs resulting from the economy-of-scale seen in the integrated circuit industry. Development of this technology will provide an extraordinarily high payoff for future NASA Space and Earth Science Enterprises. The Phase I study will demonstrate feasibility of the LTCC through detailed analyses and identification of the MEMS fabrication processes. During Phase II, a prototype LTCC will be fabricated and tested.",

Detrimental stresses in these locations lead to expensive loss of use, inspection and repair costs, and potential loss of aircraft and personnel.X-Ray diffraction--a proven technique for measuring stresses--has been taken from the laboratory to field use on large structures. However, current systems do not permit measurements in hard-to-access locations.TEC has successfully reduced the measurement head to fit inside a 6-inch diameter hole and obtain the correct stresses in aluminum. TEC proposes to reduce the measurement head to approximately 4 inches and measure stresses in aluminum, ferritic/martensiticsteels, and titanium alloys. Elements are in place for successfully measuring austenitic steels and nickel, provided a miniature manganese x-ray tube is obtainable.The ultimate goal is to produce a hand-carried, rugged, low-power consumption instrument that can correctly measure stresses in difficult-to-access locations. Emphasis will be on power requirements, personnel safety, measurement speed, data availability,ease of use and data interpretation.The proposed instrument should result in significant maintenance savings and has commercial applications to virtually all industries relying on common engineering alloys for safety-related functions.",

This negativedetection margin makes naval vessels such as submarinesvulnerable to attack, since the radar can detect the periscope ormast well before the LPI radar signal is detected.  During PhaseI, TSC developed the concept of a Delay-Multiply Detector (DMD),and demonstrated that it is capable of detecting LPI signals atranges greater than the radar's detection range with a highdetection probability, in less than the radar's dwell-time.In the basic Phase II, TSC proposes to design, fabricate, andtest a Proof-of-Concept (POC) Demonstration System consisting ofRF/IF subsections and a DMD embodied in a specially-designeddigital signal processor.  The Phase II tests will demonstratethe DMD's LPI intercept performance in a free-space laboratorysetting;  the LPI signal(s) will be generated by signal generator(s), or by LPI radar(s) such as the SCOUT, if available.

While several signal-processing approaches are being developed to exploit the spatial andwaveform diversity offered by a distributed aperture, the performance sensitivity of these algorithms has not been demonstrated under varying degrees of channel coherence, relative metrology and timing precision, and clutter environment realism. Thetesting of sparse aperture signal processing algorithms under controlled and variable conditions is critical to ensure the viability of operational concepts, robustness of space subsystems, and performance of distributed aperture architectures. Amulti-channel airborne surrogate with movable apertures will be used to provide a low-cost means of collecting data for algorithm test and evaluation. The data collections will be thoroughly planned to provide sets of SAR and GMTI range/Doppler maps thatcan be used by researchers to validate a variety of distributed aperture approaches well in advance of planned on-orbit experiments. The data sets will be used to validate several emerging signal processing concepts, including: multi-channel SAR imaging,multi-channel GMTI imaging, along-track displaced-phase center antenna processing, and SAR electronic protection. The signal processing techniques to be developed have immediate application to both nex",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR)Phase II project will develop full waveform models and minimal sensor algorithms for the General Dynamics - Advanced Technology Systems (GDATS) eddy current sensor (ECS). These algorithms will enable the practical real-time high performance health monitoring for turbine engines. Current processing techniques could require four or more sensors; however, these approaches do not make use of all the information made available by the ESC. Using the full ECS signature, it is possible, in theory, to estimate integral vibration frequency, phase and amplitude using only a single sensor. The reduction of the number of sensors required in each engine stage could potentially save millions of dollars over the life of the engine. There are no systems commercially available today for continuous health monitoring of gas turbine engines. Once in use, this system will allow pilots to react immediately to critical engine health problems thus avoiding potentially catastrophic engine failures and loss of lives. The minimal sensor algorithms for continuous health monitoring have a large market spanning the aviation industry, as well as the rapidly expanding power industry",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65233        A significant portion of U.S. oil reserves is made up of difficult-to-produce, viscous, heavy crude deposits.  To produce this oil, steam injection is used to make the oil flow more readily.  However, as the costs to produce steam rise (due to natural gas price increases and water availability) and as environmental regulations become more restrictive, new technology is needed that is more economical, more efficient, and less polluting.  This project will demonstrate that sonication, the use of acoustic energy to produce changes in fluids and solids, has the capability to reduce the viscosity of oil, allowing it to flow easier, without compromising the physical properties and chemical composition of heavy crude oil.  In Phase I, a prototype sonication system was designed and fabricated, and the system components were tested as an operating unit.  The sonication system was tested on a series of viscous oils and showed viscosity reductions between 63-70% in 20-30 minutes.  Preliminary heavy crude testing gave even better results.  In Phase II, the possible impacts of sonication on oils physical properties and chemical composition will be addressed.  A commercialization plan will be prepared, including project data, market potential, process economics, and a scaled-up design for field demonstration.  The system will be fully tested and optimized in a downhole field test.                       Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A successful technology for exploiting heavy crude oil would support energy security, ensure the stability of the U.S. domestic oil industry, and make U.S. companies more competitive in the worlds oil production arena.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65480      The production of intense fission product radioactive beams used for nuclear physics research requires special target approaches.  One such approach is that of a two-step target, in which an energetic, intense light-ion beam strikes a cooled heavy metal target to create neutrons, and the neutrons cause fissions in a surrounding blanket to make the fission products.  However, such a target has not been demonstrated to work using an intense production of light ions.  This project will construct a prototype two-step target and demonstrate the efficacy of the concept.  Phase I produced a numerical analysis of a two-step target, defining the dimensions and constituents of a prototype target.  The analysis included estimates of neutron production, fission rates, and energy deposition in the primary and secondary targets.  This was followed by a thermal analysis using finite element approaches to devise cooling strategies for the primary target and thermal control approaches for the secondary target.  Phase II will demonstrate the efficacy of a prototype two-step target using an intense production beam.  The analyses of the thermal performances of the target components from the Phase I study will be extended, and a prototype test target will be designed in detail, fabricated, and integrated into a test configuration at the TRIUMF accelerator.                         Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This technology should lead to the commercial provision of targets for intense radioactive beam facilities, including the new nuclear physics initiative, the Rare Isotope Accelerator.",

Examples include the National Transport Code Collaboration and the NIMROD collaboration.  For new scientists to join such a development team, they must learn how to navigate through the system, build it, and commit changes.  Such learning is problematic in this situation, because the relevant expert may not be at the same institution.  This project addresses the problem by developing a collaboration environment for code development, known as CoDeveloper.  Such an environment would allow participants to work together  synchronously and asynchronously  in the tasks of file editing, build system modification, building and configuring.  CoDeveloper will include built-in security mechanisms  authentication, authorization, and encrypted transmission  needed to prevent unauthorized use.  In Phase I, security architectures were investigated as the mechanisms for authentication and authorization, encrypted transmission was implemented, and a code repository mechanism was incorporated.  Remote and collaborative visualization was identified as the primary need of the community.  Phase II will develop a plug-in capability for visual tools, allowing the visualization code to be shared and transmitted to a server.  The server will render the visualization commands into a representation that can be transmitted to all clients for viewing.  In addition, the special needs of viewing toroidal fusion data will be implemented.

High-performance, high-fidelity numerical simulations will be needed for the research and design process.  This project will develop a parallel three-dimensional particle code to directly model electron-ion interactions and capture the exchange of thermal energy from the warm ions to the cool electrons incorporating novel features for detailed simulations of electron cooling physics.  The fast multipole algorithm will be used.  In Phase I, proof-of-principle was shown by demonstrating the three-dimensional parallel advance of magnetized electrons using a fast multipole algorithm to simulate coulomb collisions between ions and electrons, and demonstrating the physically correct transfer of thermal energy.  Phase II will complete the implementation and testing of the three-dimensional parallel simulation code.  This code will be used to model the proposed electron cooling section for the RHIC upgrade, in collaboration with Brookhaven National Laboratory.

CyberSafe will operate in the Windows NT environment and will employ a set of behavior-modifying wrappers to provide broad protection against malicious code contained ine-mail attachments, downloaded by a web browser, or distributed in software releases.  The system will detect both simple and complex attacks before they succeed and autonomically respond in a way that minimizes disruption of ongoing processing whilecontinuing to protect the user's and the system's resources.  It's chief strategy for doing so will be to employ a set of responses that gradually transform the execution of the malicious code from operating on the actual resources to operating in asynthetic space that hides the actual resources and substitutes virtualized ones while additional information is gathered to determine whether or not the process is malicious and the nature of the attack being perpetrated.  We refer to this technique ascontained execution.  The prototype will establish the validity of our approach to complex event recognition and management by means of contained execution.",

However, existing high-speed commercial solutions do not cost-effectively scale to the petabyte storage range.  This project will apply low-cost, commodity magnetic disk drive technology to develop a portable, fifty terabyte module, scalable to a petabyte at a cost comparable to the robotic tape libraries in use today.  In Phase I, a fully functional prototype with a capacity of two terabytes was constructed and the feasibility of the basic approach was demonstrated.  Phase II will result in a production-ready module with a storage capacity of 20-50 terabytes.  A 100 terabyte system based on the technology also will be demonstrated.            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should be viable as a short term backup solution in enterprise applications and can be applied to time critical environments where access to very large medical imaging or map databases is required.",

Current resin repair systems require low temperature storage, increasing storage cost and support complexity.Texas Research Institute Austin, Inc.

These high Tg TRI/Austin UV cureresins and glass prepreg patches will offer a field ?friendly, cost effective solution to the current repair problem. Cure times can be significantly reduced, increasing aircraft availability and reducing repair cost. The TRI/Austin aircraft field repairmaterials are easily applied, include a resin with a moderate viscosity, have a high glass transition temperature after cure, require no mixing, and cure in place without the addition of heat.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Dry film lubricants are used extensively in military and commercial aircraft engines to prevent galling, fretting and seizing and to aid in maintenance disassembly and re-assembly of threaded fasteners.  Most dry film lubricants contain volatile organiccompounds as carrier solvents.  Many also contain lead-based antioxidants for added endurance life and antimony oxide as a corrosion inhibitor. Each of these components poses an environmental hazard and their use must be discontinued. Graphite is oftenused as a lubricant by itself or with other solid lubricants.  It is known to instigate galvanic corrosion of many metals.  TRI/Austin proposes to develop a water-based system containing alternative lubricants and additives that will be environmentally andtoxicologically benign, meets the requirements of MIL-L-23398 and MIL-L-46147, and can be applied using standard procedures with minimal impact to the Navy.  The technical challenge to be faced in this development involves obtaining an adequate dispersionof the lubricant in the water-binder solution so that coating stratification does not occur during binder cure.",

The technical objectives of our Phase-2 research and development effort include the following tasks: a. Document edibility and nutritional aspects of harvestable Hibiscus tissues and fruiting structures, including flowers, nectar sugars, green pods, mature seeds, young leaves, emergent canes, and roots tissues and muccopolysaccharides; b. Develop data to support FDA petitions for use of Hibiscus tissues in value-added food and beverage products developed from said harvestable tissues; c. Evaluate options for harvesting and processing methods and equipment, including harvestors, seed cleaning and processing equipment, irrigation (drip or flood) strategies and equipment, fresh produce processing and storage, and seed separation and processing for seed oils and seed meals; and d. Demonstrate uptake of nutritional dietary minerals and salts in a set of tub trials using a representative set of BOSTx PHHiberids & Selections in support of nutraceutical enhancement of edible tissues (this demonstration is part of our Follow-on Funding Agreement). Harvestable green organs available for potential annual production from this perennial crop include young green shoots, green cane outer fibers (which will include polysaccharide analyses), edible fresh flowers and green pods (an okra substitute), green seeds, and active roots. Harvestable mature organs available annually from this perennial crop include canes (cellulosic outer fibers, lignitic core, parenchyme center), mature seed pods and seeds, and dormant roots. The scope of this component of the project includes independent characterization of the above- and below-ground components of representative members of the genomes we are introducing as new food and fiber crops. VBI plans to market flavored gourmet vinegarettes, unflavored polished wines, and specialty flavored drinking alcohols, each in seven different color ranges: white, yellow, blush, pink, orange-red, purple-blue, and deep red. These edible liquids are used to extract Hibiscus pigments and muccopolysaccharids from the petals into the formulation vessel(s). Because the edible organic acids and ethanols used in VBI's formulations may extract the flavonoid glycosides from the flower tissue differently than does the methanol used in the laboratory analytical method for Hibiscus flowers, analysis of the formulations themselves (with and without flavorings) is necessary to fully characterize the formulas.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Recent technical advances may allow high power microwave (HPM) directed energy weapons (DEW) for deployment on aircraft in the near future.  Major obstacles in the their application will require effective solutions in high heat flux thermal management andreducing the mass of the components.  An innovative lightweight thermal management concept providing high heat flux capability for HPM source devices for DEW systems is proposed.  The thermal approach utilizes enhanced cooling mechanisms (subcoolednucleate flow-boiling cooling) coupled with an optimized cooling channel geometry that can be integrated within the HPM structure.  The concept provides both improved thermal performance (capability up to 500 W/cm2) and a low mass thermal management systemfor projected aircraft DEW applications.  The enhanced heat transfer allows much higher heat flux operation yet maintains the structure's temperature.  The overall design concept provides a mass efficient and highly effective thermal control approach thatwill provide necessary enabling technology for successful deployment of advanced HPM directed energy weapon systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         To maximize the performance of the next generation of vehicles, including hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), the Army needs an integrated design tool. Employing the latest advances in computer conceptual design and simulation techniques, ThermoAnalytics, Inc.(TAI) proposes to create a tool to allow designers to simultaneously optimize drivetrain performance, thermal management, and signature control. TAI will integrate two of their software packages: HEVsim, a drivetrain design simulator, and MuSES, a powerfulthermal analysis and signature prediction tool. TAI will also add in new and innovative modules. To design cooling and exhaust systems, TAI will develop a fluid flow analyzer. This CFD code will be tailored to flow problems specific to vehicle design, thusallowing the code to be tuned for fast and easy use. To solve for volumetric heat transfer in thick armor blocks, TAI will use the boundary element method (BEM). Compared with conventional finite element techniques, BEM is faster and more tolerant of meshimperfections. Overall, the GUI-based vehicle design tool will provide continuous performance feedback to the user throughout the design process, guiding the user through parameter trades and design space explorations. The end result will be robust vehicledesigns optimized for performance, efficiency, and survivability.",

The development of an anatomically realistic thermal computer code, capable of predicting tissue temperatures, is an important accomplishment, bothscientifically and for the potential economic benefit deriving from the use of the models. ThermoAnalytics has further developed its existing commercial thermal software to exploit the structure of voxel-based descriptions. In Phase II, we propose tooptimize and enhance the Phase I 3-D heat transfer code to make it more compact, faster, and able to solve sophisticated problems. The Phase II code will have enhanced user input and output features as well as a graphical user interface. At the end ofPhase II, we will have developed a bio-heat transfer code that incorporates: 1) Physiological heat sources and thermoregulatory mechanisms (metabolic heating, sweating/evaporative cooling, respiratory cooling, and blood flow withvasoconstriction/vasodilatation); 2) passive and active clothing models; 3) environmental loads (solar heating, radiation exchange, wind convection); and human comfort model.",

Our Phase I results demonstrate feasibility of HSM and high-frequency tooth pass (HFTP)technology to overcome inherent titanium barriers and double metal removal rates (MRR) while maintaining tool life.To accomplish this dramatic improvement of titanium machining, we must apply HSM/HFTP techniques to titanium. Barriers include: (1) lack of validated analytical tools to reduce dependency on testing, and (2) high cost and inefficient methods for testingnew machining concepts. Our Phase II project approach develops advanced technology to achieve this, based on technology used in Phase I to identify regimes of titanium machining that promise MRR doubling.We will use the advanced modeling technology to demonstrate how process improvement barriers can be cost effectively reduced. Our demonstration consists of the following: (1) application of validated modeling technology specifically developed for metalcutting, (2) use of modeling techniques to significantly reduce need for testing while enabling implementation of new concepts, and (3) application of identified HSM/HFTP titanium machining regimes to military aerospace components provided by Boeing andSikorsky Aircraft to demonstrate MRR potential.",

This addresses an important NASA technology gap for astrobiology related studies, mainly how to acquire and process deep subsurface samples for in situ analysis while meeting challenging mass, volume and power constraints. In these high pressure environments, the integrity of the sample may be compromised by degassing of volatile components if brought to the surface. Our proposed high pressure micro-sampling inlet system addresses this by collecting a micro-sample in the high pressure environment, then transfers it into a protected low pressure environment within the instrument housing for processing and analysis. The proposed enabling technology will allow in situ analysis in deep subsurface environments by the new generation of miniaturized, low power instruments being developed by NASA, including GC/MS, isotope spectrometers, and other techniques that inherently require low pressures for operation. Since we plan to follow a modular design approach in our Phase II development, this core instrumentation can be adapted for a variety of astrobiology-related applications including Cryobot missions in deep ice and deep sea measurements.",

Oncogenic Ras is such a protein present in 90 percent of pancreatic carcinomas and 1/3 of all human cancers. Thyreos\r Corporation has licensed drugs that inactivate Ras by displacement from its\r anchorage site in the cell membrane. These drugs inhibit Ras-dependent human\r tumors grown in nude mice. There are no toxic effects at doses that cause tumor\r regression. To register Ras antagonists with the FDA for cancer therapy is a\r major goal of Thyreos. The specific aims of this grant will be to complete the\r next steps in this process: we will continue the preclinical pharmacology on\r the Ras-antagonist, FTS, in nude mice with transplants of human tumors. The\r studies will demonstrate the dose response effects of FTS on human tumors, its\r synergism with standard chemotherapy, the frequency of drug administration, the\r maximal tolerated doses, the need for a loading dose and the duration of a drug\r free period. The pharmacokinetics, metabolism, distribution and excretion of\r FTS in mice and rats will be studied. While Thyreos completes these studies as\r outlined in the Specific Aims it will complete the remainder of preclinical\r development. Thus at the end of the Phase II grant Thyreos will be able to file\r an IND for a phase 1/2 study. FTS acts on a newly identified cancer target. To\r our knowledge there is no other drug being developed that has the same\r mechanism of action as FTS.",

Supercontinuum (white-light) continuum generation in the atmosphereusing terawatt femtosecond laser pulses have already been suggested for novel LIDAR applications in the spectral range from the UV to IR, to perform range resolved multitrace analysis simultaneously. In addition, the generation of a high-intensity (>1013W/cm2) light channel over long distances offers the possibility to probe nonlinear effects such as Raman processes, harmonic generation, nonlinear frequency mixing, and plasma generation at a remote location. The program will demonstrate applicability tosensor countermeasures and remote sensing by detailed experimentation, using a femtosecond laser system. Long-range propagation experiments using a 500-meter laser range will analyze the effects of initial pulse energy, beam radius, frequency chirp, andwavefront divergence on the propagation distance. Laser pulse propagation dynamics under multiple filamentation conditions will be characterized. Additional experiments will quantify EMP generation from the induced plasma column and laser pulse materialinteractions including surface damage assessment /secondary radiations effects. Simulations will include the usual plasma generation, dispersion and nonlinear effects, as well as vector waves and harmonic generation. This effort will result in a modelthat, when verified by experimentation, will serve as the basis for development of novel, long range LIDAR systems.  These systems will be used to detect chemical/biological agents at long ranges, as well as provide a means for remote detection ofatmospheric chemicals and aerosols for monitoring of pollution.  These advanced LIDAR systems may also be used to remotely measure atmospheric turbulence, providing improved, early alert of wind-shear to landing aircraft.",

Materials will reflect the unique culture of Appalachia. The Kit will contain three components developmentally suited to the prevention needs of Appalachian youth aged 11 - 13, 14 - 16, and 17 - 18. Appalachia is important: With one in 12 Americans living there, the region has a population equal to that of all Latino Americans at the 1990 census. Though Appalachia has significant legal and social impediments to alcohol use, alcohol abuse there is common. Nevertheless, the region lacks culturally appropriate materials for alcohol prevention. Relying on sound prevention science, the firm seeks to develop materials that use the focal role of women in the Appalachian family as the access point. Staff demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in Phase I. Staff will conduct focus groups of members of the respective developmental ranges to understand how mothers and youth react to alcohol prevention. Based on findings, staff will develop materials for the components of the Kit. When all components are completed, staff will test the firm's hypothesis about the efficacy of the approach with a pre-test/post-test experiment. We then will finalize the kit by the grant's end.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Automatic test equipment typically uses voltage measurements to identify failures in electronic equipment. In practice electrical current (EC) measurements are very seldom performed due to the intrusive aspect of the EC measurement. This Phase II effortprovides a significant opportunity to develop a process to capture EC measurements as well as methods to extract and display steady state and transient EC information. Steady state information indicates the static performance of a circuit. Analysis of thetransient portion of the EC measurement introduces new valuable information regarding the reactive or dynamic performance of the circuit. Reactive components can then be diagnosed by their dynamic performance. The capability of simultaneously measuring thecomplex voltage and EC provides new and valuable insight into the impedance. This newly available information will be input to Neural Networks for both training and analysis of failure ambiguities. The prototype will introduce innovative capabilities fortest equipment technicians, and test software engineers. This effort will demonstrate the use of EC data and information to support fault diagnostic procedures in Ogden depot for the F-16 and other weapon systems. It should be extendable to other militaryand commercial aeronautical, automotive, medical, and industrial applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Arthroscopic surgery is one of the most commonly performed operations in the US. As in all surgical specialties, the bulk of the surgeon?s arthroscopic skills are acquired while working on live patients. Today?s climate of contained healthcare costs, patient rights, and associated litigation has created a strong demand to find alternatives to using patients for practicing medical procedures. A simulator reproducing the look and feel of real joint anatomy could be used to impart a significant portion of these skills with instructor-controlled curriculum, unprecedented procedure feedback, and no patient risk. Touch of Life Technologies is developing Virtual Anatomy (VA), based on color photographs of high-resolution cryosectioned human specimens. VA models have significantly higher-resolution than is currently available using any other existing technology. Yet, because they are polygonally based, they may be displayed both haptically and graphically in real-time using inexpensive and widely available graphics hardware. This SBIR will demonstrate the efficacy of high-resolution VA and apply it to produce a realistic arthroscopy simulator.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The simulator will be marketed to train and test orthopedic residents and fellows, upgrade the skills of practicing surgeons, and provide an objective foundation for certification and credentialing.  It will also provide a platform for orthopedic tool and device makers to introduce and to train doctors on their new developments.",

The fusion module will consist of a Bayesian Network and a statistical database. The Bayesian Network will update beliefs about whattype of target is being measured by taking into consideration a priori information regarding the types of airborne objects in an area, the kinematic state estimate provided by a tracker, and the capabilities of the sensors providing measurements. Thestatistical database will provide information regarding the expected characteristics of the sensors and the expected kinematic characteristics of each target type. One of the important advantages of our approach is that information from sensors whichprovide data at different levels in a target-class hierarchy can be effectively fused. We will build a computer simulation of the non-cooperative target recognition (NCTR) architecture so that we can test the fusion module using a realistic number ofsensor measurements. Optional tasks include the analysis of ATR outcomes for building the statistical database, installing and testing the fusion module within a government facility, and integrating the fusion module with a tracker and sensor tasker.",

The technology is based on an array of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensors that produce high-resolution images of hidden defects, missing parts, and other features. Minute GMR sensors detect magnetic fields associated with eddy currents induced in the component being imaged. High spatial resolution images are achieved through the high density and small size of the sensors in the array, coupled with the high sensitivity, low noise, and fast response of the sensors. A GMR sensor array, combined with a magnetic field generator, can produce high resolution, three-dimensional images of parts as they are produced, using a rugged, non-contacting sensor system. The images provide on-line feedback for process control, quality assurance, and safety protocols. The Phase I project developed functional GMR sensor arrays, and successfully imaged defects in metallic parts clearly demonstrating that the technology is feasible. The commercial potential of the proposed technology will be in manufacturing, quality assurance (QA), and process control. It will be used for rapid imaging and inspection of parts used in electronics, aerospace, automotive, transportation, construction, biomedical and other industries.",

The work detailed in this              proposal will commercialize this technology for point-of-care use in a clinical      setting. The goal of this research is to move metals monitoring out of the           analytical labs and to the point-of-interest/care. The sensor detects metals at      trace and ultra-trace levels: the detection limit is in the low                      parts-per-billion (0.1 micrograms per deciliter) range. Coupled with                 instantaneous results and superior accuracy, these detection limits will             provide with accurate and point-of-care screening for toxic metals in children,      adults, and their environment.

This monitor will measure lead, mercury, and cadmium in      biological fluids at parts per billion (ppb) and sub-ppb levels. It will also        measure these contaminants in water and other aqueous solutions at the same          detection levels, making it suitable for many applications, from municipal           water and industrial process control to the environmental, analytical, and work      place safety markets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65036      The production of ultra low sulfur gasoline and diesel at a sustainable cost, and available in quantities that will meet the demands of U.S. drivers, is potentially the single most significant and costly challenge faced by the refining industry.  While commercially available hydrotreating technology is available to reduce sulfur in fuels, the cost to meet federal standards has been estimated to be $12-16 billion.  New, more cost efficient technology needs to be developed rapidly to provide alternatives to refiners in the 2006-2010 timeframe.  This project will develop a novel electrochemical membrane reactor that is capable of reducing the sulfur content of gasoline to the identified limit of 30 ppm with essentially no loss in octane.  It would also be capable of lowering the sulfur content of diesel to <10 ppm at pressures that are 500 psi lower than that needed for distillate hydrotreaters.  In Phase I, substantial progress was achieved in the fabrication of the solid electrolyte required for this process, and components for the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) were chosen based on their thermal and chemical stability.  Desulfurization of diesel fuel was demonstrated at levels well below the EPA requirements for 2006.  Phase II will optimize the fabrication procedure, scale up the MEA, produce a working prototype of the electrochemical reactor, and advance the desulfurization process to the small-pilot-plant stage.         Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The electrochemical membrane reactor should be applicable to the desulfurization of gasoline, diesel, vacuum gas oil (cat cracker feed), and heavy oil.  The clean-up of liquid hydrocarbons for use in fuel cells (source of hydrogen) is another application.  The specific electrochemical device, apart from functioning as a membrane reactor, could also provide power to electric or hybrid electric vehicles.  Finally, it could be used for electric utility load leveling on a large scale (>10 MW).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Hyperexcitability of spinal sensory neurons contributes significantly to pain syndromes, e.g. after nerve injury and inflammation. A method for dampening hyperexcitability of these neurons is expected to ameliorate neuropathic pain, and the targeting of sensory neuron-specific molecules may yield pain relief with minimal side effects. Sodium channels generate the inward currents that underlie action potentials. Several sodium channels have now been identified in spinal sensory neurons (e.g. dorsal root ganglia, DRG neurons). Small diameter DRG neurons, the majority of which are nociceptive, express sodium currents that are sensitive to the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX-S) and others that are resistant (TTX-R). TTX-R currents are increased in experimental models of inflammation. Recently, a novel rat TTX-R Na+ channel that is preferentially expressed in high threshold nociceptive neurons of DRG and trigeminal ganglia was identified. Work supported by our Phase I SBIR permitted creation of several rat NaN/SNS2 clones which will be useful tools for developing cell-based assays. We also obtained the human NaN/SNS2 sequence. We propose to characterize rat and human NaN expression and current in transfected mammalian cells. This represents a critical step toward developing molecular targets in cell-based assays for high throughput screening for agents that modulate the activity of this sensory neuron-specific channel.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Over 100,000 PTFE graft angioplasties are performed in America each year to restore adequate access flow, but up to 50% of the procedures must be repeated within three months. Radiologist now derive interventional efficacy from pressure and vessel diameter measurements. Direct measurement of volume flow (ml/min) would give immediate feedback on procedural success.   Transonic Systems proposes to resolve this need by further developing and commercializing an inexpensive catheter-based AngioFlowmeter for measuring blood flow during angioplasty of PTFE grafts and native fistulae. Our Phase-I clinical studies demonstrated that access flow may be measured accurately and repeatably using thermodilution catheters introduced through the angioplasty antegrade sheath and room temperature saline injections.   Our Phase-ll plans are to: Attain FDA clearance. Refine and validate the catheter designs and measurement algorithms for catheter placement through antegrade and retrograde introducer sheaths; Refine and validate algorithms to identify whether the flow-limiting stenosis is on the graft arterial or venous side; Demonstrate the system's efficacy in controlled clinical trials; Publish results of the study in preparation for market introduction.  At the end of Phase II, Transonic Systems aims to market the AngioFlowmeter as a new quality assurance tool for interventional radiology procedures.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: An access flow measurement catheter would have routine use during radiological and surgical interventions to restore flow.  It would allow quantitative assessment of the efficacy of percutaneous angioplasty and thus support improved outcomes.  This may in turn reduce the need for repeat interventions, improve the quality of life for ESRD patients, and reduce healthcare costs in the US by $18 million/year.  We aim to market this device to surgical and interventional radiology and interventional radiology suites worldwide.",

UESA will offer full electronic scanning capability inan airborne radar system, a feature which is crucial to targetacquisition and tracking, and hence the defense of navalbattlegroups.  To achieve its full potential, UESA requires atapered beam excitation, in which the excitation peaks at adesired array element and falls off away from it.  At the sametime, phase control of the excitation must be maintained to alterthe direction of the beam.   The solution proposed is to use broadside couplers tocontrol the amplitudes of the beamform, along with phase shiftersto control its phase profile.  Phase I of the study provided thegeneral design concept of the integrated device, the fabricationprocess, and material specifications.  The Phase II study wepropose here will implement the design and work toward a working,fully characterized prototype of the device, as well as a robustfabrication process for future production.  The task will requirethe fabrication of three major components: the broadside couplercircuit, the phase shifters, and the support electronicscontrolling the phase shifters.BENEFITS: If successful, the work can find application in military airborne radar platforms.

Available miniature high-resolution displays will be evaluated foruse in the STID, the most appropriate of which will be integrated into one of three prototype systems to be built:  wrist-mounted, head-mounted, and handheld.  The effort will involve the development and implementation of a number of component technologiesthat are essential to an effective low-power STID solution:  high-resolution VGA screen capture, virtually lossless real-time image compression, advanced short-range UWB communications, and miniature high-resolution display interfacing.  These individualelements will be integrated into a transmitter unit which can capture and send display information from any standard VGA host device to a display receiver unit a short distance away.  This will enable high-quality tetherless display capability for a numberof military and commercial applications, including wireless personal area networking (WPAN).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Recent advancements in integrated circuit miniaturization and network topologies in the communications industry have given rise to the development of products providing short range (less than ten meters) wireless connectivity for both voice and datacommunications.  Several industry initiatives, among them Bluetooth and HomeRF, have created de facto standards for RF systems that operate using spread spectrum modes in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands of frequencies, at very low powerlevels.  One promising application for this emerging technology is in the area of wireless personal area networks (WPANs).  Trident proposes exploiting this technology to provide secure wireless voice and data links between soldier-borne systems such ascombat net radios, personal GPS units (PLGR), and digital message transfer devices (DMTDs), as well as tetherless intercom connections for vehicle crews and associated dismounted personnel.  These links will enhance operational efficiency by eliminatingcabled connections and providing dynamically self-configuring personal voice and data network connectivity on the battlefield.  Trident will exploit its background in portable SA/C2 systems to develop a solution that integrates readily into the Army'sbattlefield digitization effort.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         On future extended-flight, exploration-class missions to the Moon or to Mars, astronaut crews will need a minimum 3-year food supply. Triton addresses this challenge by developing new polymer nanocomposite-based materials solutions for food packaging. Nanocomposite materials, based in high-barrier resins, such as PET, EVOH, and polyethylene, can outperform unfilled materials in ways crucial to the needs of NASA and the extended-flight missions. Triton Nanocomposites increase the barrier capabilities of such materials by over 2-3 times. Nanocomposites remain lightweight, flexible, moldable and fully recyclable. With such dramatic increases in barrier properties, nanocomposites can allow the necessary weight and volume of food packaging to be reduced by at least half with decreased packaging wall-thickness. These unique advantages result from the nano-dispersion of very high aspect ratio (>100:1), organically-modified layered alumino-silicates (ORMLASTM). The successful nanocomposite contains well-dispersed and highly orientated nano-platelets, which form an inorganic barrier to diffusing species. This remarkable nano-structure also increases strength and tensile modulus without loss of flexibility and the low-loading levels (2-8%) do not result in any weight-increase or loss of processibility. Reduced resistance to heat and moisture makes these materials fully retortable as well as microwaveable and compatible for use with convection ovens, or hot-water-injection.",

This enabling technology will be used as light weight, high performance primary structure components composing large acreage areas of the vehicle. Tritons proposed SBIR program will demonstrate an integrated composite approach, utilizing hybrid metal-ceramic matrix composite (MCMC). The MCMC will be the basis of unitized structural component designs where the ceramic surface resists aerothermal loads while sharing and transferring thermo-mechanical loads with the integrated high specific strength metal composite. Tritons structurally efficient hybrid TPS will significantly reduce reusable vehicle cost and weight by eliminating design, acquisition, and assembly of the two separate systems, structural air frame and thermal protection, required by current parasitic TPM. Furthermore, not only can the MCMC be welded, but it can be fabricated with complex features such as hat-bands, bushings, and threaded attachment points so existing joining technologies will be used to assemble the hybrid composite hot structural members.",

This architecture will enable deployment of agile, split-based, networkcentric communication systems that are distributed, collaborative, and scalable. By breaking the mold of server-based methods for QoS and Security, we achieve significant cost reduction while improving the performance and scalability. Our proposed solutionwill be the first product with true end-to-end QoS (IS and DS) and security.Our Phase II goal is to deliver a prototype software and hardware that provides support for end-to-end QoS and Security. Dedicated hardware integrated into a network interface card (NIC) will be used to improve performance with in-line implementation ofQoS and Security protocols and data processing. There are some NICs in the market that have tried to support security and QoS, but they have not been very successful because of lack of end-to-end feature.Since our architecture allows for application independent QoS and security, there will be no need to modify individual applications.

        "abstract": "Abstract         During the Phase I of the project, we developed a system level architecture for end-to-end voice authentication and security in mobile phones. The core of our architecture is a protocol, MNGIsec, that for the first time provides NAT compatible end-to-endsecurity in mobile phone based communications. Based on our effort a provisional patent (60/315,234) has been filed. We have also overcome a security hole in mobile communications, that arises from lost devices containing keys for secure communication, byincorporating biometric authentication based on voice.There are some mobile phones in the market that incorporate security, but have not been very successful because of lack of end-to-end feature. Currently there are no mobile phones that supports biometrics based authentication or integrate biometrics withsecure communications. Our proposed solution will be the first product with true end-to-end authentication, security, and VPN functionality in mobile phones. Since our solution provides application independent security and authentication, there will be noneed to modify individual applications.Our Phase II goal is to deliver prototype software and hardware suitable for use in mobile phones. Dedicated hardware integrated into the mobile phones will improve system performance by in-line implementation of security protocols and speech dataprocessing.",

The proposed Cryogenic Advanced Loop Heat Pipe (CALHP) with hydrogen working fluid will accommodate all stated requirements. It solves the difficult problem of managing parasitic heat gain in the liquid line, which severely limits the cryogenic capillary pumped loop, by using a secondary pumping system that effectively removes the heat gain. It also enables operation at lower temperatures. The CALHP then does not require liquid cooled shielding which is required for the cryogenic CPL, where the liquid line is looped around the condenser several times to cool the shield. This also means that the CALHP transport section can be made flexible by limiting the number of lines passing through the interface.",

The proposed LHP code, in its final form, will enable the spacecraft thermal engineer to effectively model their LHP TCS that is coupled to the spacecraft. It will be able to provide valuable insights during early program trade-off studies, by making independent evaluation of varying LHP TCS designs possible, and will allow the thermal engineer to accurately predict/bound tests and on-orbit performances. The LHP code can be integrated with any industry standard thermal analyzer, and will require only input data that can be provided by the LHP vendor. Expertise in LHP technology will not be required to utilize the code.",

In Phase I, significant improvement in strength of a 7050 aluminum alloy by modifications ofchemistry and thermomechanical/heat treatment processes was demonstrated. The modified alloy showed very high strength of 850 MPa and elongation of 8% at 77K. Even much higher strength of 1060 MPa was achieved after certain heat treatment, at elongation ofabout 1%. Phase II will pursue (a) optimization of the alloy composition, (b) development of industry-compatible thermomechanical and heat treatment processes for this alloy, and (c) sufficient characterization of sub-scale components to permit preliminarydesign of a real-scale turbopump impeller. Integral to this advanced development is a comprehensive understanding of the microstructure and physical metallurgy of the modified alloy in controlling the desired properties to direct further development andcommercialization. Mechanical property data on the major design driver properties will be determined, both at room and cryogenic temperatures. It is believed that the Phase II effort will bring the alloy to a commercially usable state, and a full-scalecomponent produced from this alloy in the following Phase III will perform as predicted and required.",

The           system will couple high-frequency ultrasound (40 MHz) with novel signal              processing to provide accurate, precise biometry of the cornea and anterior          chamber. Measurements will be used by ophthalmologists to: 1) plan refractive        laser surgery of the cornea (for vision correction and restoration); 2) select       the appropriate type and size of recently developed intra-ocular lenses (IOL)        to correct refractive errors or restore vision following cataract surgery; and,      3) document causes of undesired side-effects following laser and IOL                 procedures, so that corrective actions can be initiated promptly. The system         will incorporate advanced, patented methodology developed by the Weill Medical       College of Cornell University (WMC) and Riverside Research Institute (RRI).

This            innovative system functioned extremely well, but it also identified several          practical issues that will be addressed in this program so that these                techniques can realize their full clinical and commercial potentials. The            program will integrate system design (Phase I), and development and testing          (Phase II) at Ultralink, WMC, and RRI.

Chief amongthese is improved safety, which will significantly decrease overall use costs.  However, both types of reduced-toxicity monopropellants are difficult to ignite.  While this is an asset with respect to safety, it is a liability with respect todesign.  Phase I demonstrated the activity of Ultramet's advanced catalysts at -10C, which is well below the activation temperature required by the industry standard catalyst Shell-405.  Not only was the room temperature reaction violent enough to scattersome of the catalyst, but the catalyst also maintained its activity even after repeated propellant additions.  In the area of catalyst supports, Ultramet has fabricated a number of candidate supports with surface areas in excess of 380 m2/g,and supported catalysts with surface areas of 450 m2/g have been produced; other supports with surface areas almost an order of magnitude greater have also been synthesized, but not yet tested.  In this Phase II project, Ultramet proposes to build on theresults of Phase I and use its extensive experience with catalysts, catalyst supports, and catalytic ignition to develop a low temperature, long-life catalyst for the decomposition of CINCH fuel.

Primary among these are increased specific impulse and reduced launch weight. Previously, the use of gaseous O2/H2 was limited by the lack of a combustion chamber material capable of withstanding the temperatures of stoichiometric O2/H2 combustion. Ultramet recently solved this problem by demonstrating a material system capable of operating for several hours under stoichiometric conditions utilizing only radiation cooling. Because the chambers reached temperatures of nearly 2600?C during testing, a water-cooled injector was used. That will not be an option in space, so an injector must be developed that will be able to withstand these extreme temperatures and minimize thermal soakback to the valves. In Phase I, an uncooled combustion chamber/injector system for use with stoichiometric O2/H2 propellants was designed, fabricated, and hot-fire tested. Phase II will focus on improving the life of the combustion chamber by taking a critical look at the designs of both the chamber and the injector. Modifications will be made, and several iterations of hot-fire testing will be performed. Based on previous hot-fire testing with this material system, it is anticipated that lifetimes in excess of ten hours can be achieved.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         No timely and cost-effective methods now exist for fabrication of thick-section (>=2), continuous fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs). Application of such CMCs can enhance the efficiency and performance, reduce the weight, improve the durability, and lower the cost of aerospace propulsion systems, particularly those used in high temperature, high-stress environments. Achieving these benefits requires development of matrix infiltration techniques capable of efficiently producing thick parts. The quality of such parts will also depend on implementation of improved fiber/matrix interfaces and interface deposition techniques. Carbon fibers are of particular interest as CMC reinforcements because they are relatively inexpensive, have higher strength and stiffness and lower density than oxide or non-oxide ceramic fibers, and retain their mechanical properties at very high temperatures. The main drawback of carbon fibers is their low oxidation resistance, which has prevented their extensive use in high temperature oxidizing environments. Oxide interfaces can potentially impart sufficient protection, as well as provide other essential interface functions related to load transfer between fibers. In Phase I, Ultramet demonstrated a unique and innovative process for depositing oxide interfaces, specifically ultraviolet-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (UVCVD), throughout thick fiber preforms. Ultramet also successfully achieved rapid infiltration of carbide matrices into thick-section (1) fiber preforms, up to 98% dense, using an innovative melt infiltration process and obtained initial mechanical properties and oxidation performance of the resultant composites. In Phase II, Ultramet will optimize material selection and processing parameters to produce low-porosity carbon/silicon carbide (C/SiC) thick-section CMCs having optimal strength, stiffness, and oxidation performance, and scale up the processing to fabricate components up to 14 diameter x 2.5 thick.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"Ultrasound is a preferred modality for live-scan fingerprint imaging because of the superior image quality it produces (i.e. Modulation Transfer Function) that is unaffected by environmental and situational threats that affect other fingerprint sensors.Recent advancements in ultrasonic fingerprint technology indicate that significant improvements in accuracy (multiple orders of magnitude) can be achieved using an innovative solution pioneered by Ultra-Scan Corporation.  The development of a large scanaperture ultrasonic fingerprint sensor provides unique three dimensional biometric data not offered by other biometric sensors.  This, along with the application of a novel three-dimensional, non-linear biometric fusion algorithm will result in a nextgeneration system with accuracies that far exceed the current state of the industry.  This level of accuracy, coupled with ultrasound's inherent insensitivity to contamination, makes it ideally suited for tactical military deployment where theenvironmental conditions vary tremendously.In Phase II, Ultra-Scan will develop prototype ultrasonic fingerprint identification systems.  Beta testing will be conducted and Independent Verification and Validation of the system performance will be measured using Fast Track and Phase II matchingfunds.  The Company with their extensive portfolio of patents in this field makes them uniquely qualified to perform this work and to commercialize upon its result",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The removal of sub-micron sized particles from an aqueous stream based on electrostatic attraction is proposed. The system will remove suspended particles from a gas-water-solid mixture with minimal flow restrictions. This is particularly important for the removal of fine alumina particles in the outlet stream from the Volatile Removal Assembly (VRA), since high pressures are required to force the gas-water mixture through a small pore collection filter. Electrophoretic particle removal will result in direct capture on the oppositely charged surface of removal media or an electrode, or by collection of larger aggregates formed at such surfaces on a large pore filter. Zeta potential is a measure of the effective surface charge on suspended particles. For oxides, the zeta potential varies strongly with pH, reaching zero at the isoelectric pH. The zeta potential is negative at pHs above this value, and positive at pHs below it. Particle collection by removal media requires an opposite polarity zeta potential, or alternatively, an electrode with the proper surface potential at the pH of interest. The Phase I effort will demonstrate feasibility. The Phase II project will result in the delivery of a prototype scaled to handle the nominal VRA flow rates.",

United Applied Technologies has demonstrated the feasibility and scaleability of the basic manufacturing processes for producing preformed deployable thin polyimide film mirrors using low-cost tooling for process refinement. Spherical polyimide film mirrors, 0.5- meter diameter with thicknesses ranging to less than 20 m, have been produced that are self-supporting in one-G. These membrane mirrors passively maintain their preformed shape after deployment. The manufacture of large aperture preformed membrane mirrors with shape and smoothness control to within nanometers using the above approach requires both high-precision tooling with highly polished surfaces, and precise preforming process parameter control. The innovation to be evaluated in this effort is development and refinement of new membrane mirror preforming processes that produce highly accurate mirrors with tooling that is much lower in cost and is scaleable to large diameters. Alternate polyimide materials that produce membranes with higher surface smoothness and lower coefficients of thermal expansion will be evaluated using these new processes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         United Biomedical, Inc, (UBI) has developed an alternative approach to injectable LHRH agonists and other androgen-ablation therapies for the treatment of prostate cancer through development of an anti-LHRH immune response.  The LHRH synthetic peptide vaccine comprises the LHRH decapeptide covalently linked to helper T cell epitopes and to an additional peptide that provides specific immune adjuvanting activities. This molecular conformation produces a potent B cell response and anti- LHRH antibodies in sufficiently high titer to neutralize circulating LHRH and thereby suppress androgen production. Studies in rodents have demonstrated that the LHRH peptide vaccine can rouse a specific immune response that inhibits and androgen-dependent tumor growth in the host by blocking synthesis of testosterone. The goal is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the LHRH peptide vaccine prepared in several adjuvant formulations to induce antibody adult male baboons. If successful, these preclinical studies will provide supporting data for an IND application and the testing of the LHRH peptide vaccine formulation as an alternative hormonal ablative therapy for prostate cancer. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The LHRH synthetic peptide vaccine is an immunotherapy for the treatment of androgen-responsive, advanced prostate cancer. This vaccine is predicted to be effective because its mode of action is analogous to the LHRH agonist-androgen-ablation therapies currently used to treat prostate cancer as well as other hormone-responsive benign conditions and tumors (e.g., endometriosis, leiomyoma). Commercial advantages of the LHRH vaccine therapy over agonists include improved patient compliance and less costly treatment option.",

The innovative process technology and the novel SIT design will make it possible (i) to achieve normally-off RFSITs, (ii) to substantially improve RF SIT's output power stability, (iii) to drastically increase the single chip SIT power density and power output, and (iv) to allow the SIT to operate at much higher temperatures with minimum concerns on thermallimitations. In Phase II, we propose to carry out the major research and development of the novel normally-off SITs, with efforts focused on experimental fabrications, packaging and characterization. A systematic study is planned to fully develop the novelSIT in terms of its power density, output signal stability, frequency performance, and temperature capability. Computer modeling will also be performed to further guiding the structure optimization. Processing technology will be further developed andoptimized. Our target is to have prototype normally-off SITs capable of high power and high temperature operations in the highly desired normally-off mode by the end of Phase II. In the privately funded Phase III, we plan to conduct commercializationdevelopment and have limited amount of high power RF SITs commercially available by the end of the first year of Phase III effort for prototype system demonstration.",

They also offer high reliability at high temperature without relying on a future solution to the problem of gate dielectricreliability under high temperature and electric field. In Phase II, we should substantially increase the total current capability, reduce the forward voltage drop, determine the switching property, and test the reliability under high current, high electricfield and high temperatures. A detailedcomputer modeling of the DC and AC characteristics of the novel device will be carried out at temperatures up to 300C to help guiding the experiments.

The Adaptive-Advanced Filter Bank (A-AFB)technology provides an architecture to combine state-of-the-art converters to dramatically increase the speed while maintaining high resolution . The performance of the AFB architecture is greatly enhanced by the application of highly innovative adaptiveprocessing.   By eliminating stages of RF downconversion, this technology greatly accelerates the progress toward direct digitization of wideband data directly at the antenna/aperture and substantially reduces part count, power requirements, mass, andincreases reliability.  In this project, V-Corp will take this technology from the breadboard/concept phase to the fully functioning product design and prototyping stage which provides performance well beyond state-of-the art for use in a functionaldemonstration vehicle.  An open architecture prototype system will be implemented to provide a versatile platform to rapidly develop, test, and integrate the very latest converters with a variety of adaptive array processing AFB algorithms, which greatly simplify calibration,track and correct errors that drift over time and temperature, and improves performance;  target specifications include:         12-bit ADC with 1.0 GHz sample rate (with d",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This innovation relates to the development of a stitched composite hollow core fan blade that would be used in the first stage of a commercial or military turbofan jet engine. It is a novel design concept that incorporates the recent advancements made in stitched composites under NASA Contract NAS1-20546 (Technology Verification of Composite Primary Wing Structures for Commercial Transport Aircraft) and further advances the state-of-the-art by employing a unique fabrication method that results in a hollow core part that is lightweight, damage tolerant, and inexpensive to manufacture. A significant improvement in structural efficiency is made possible by two important features: 1) the superior damage tolerance characteristics of stitched composites, and 2) the ability to produce a lightweight hollow core geometry. The combination of these two features enables the design of a revolutionary fan blade structure that is capable of meeting even the most stringent birdstrike loading requirements. In addition to the structural benefits, by using a proven lowcost fabrication approach like Resin Transfer Molding (RTM), this blade concept is capable of creating new markets because its fabrication costs will be even lower than those currently realized for solid titanium fan blade components.",

These costs are driven by the need to use inefficient conventional chemical reactors and the need to separate the organic phase in a separate unit operation.  This project will combine a novel reactor design with cost effective phase transfer catalysis (PTC) technology so that reaction and separation can be performed in one step. This approach will save capital and energy costs because of thermodynamically efficient phase contacting and inherently easier phase separation.  Phase I built and demonstrated a new Taylor-Vortex countercurrent reactor in which phase transfer catalysis was combined with the enhanced fluid mechanics from counter-current Taylor Vortex flow, leading to enhanced processing capability.  Phase II will improve on the processing attributes of the design by building several small prototypes to demonstrate the range of chemical systems the unit can handle.  In addition, a large demonstration unit will be built to provide sound economic data for potential users.              Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  PTC technology should allow the recovery of byproducts at small and intermediate sized companies in the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries.

Phase I work established the feasibility of all component systems, and the functionality of the integrated system. Proposed Phase II work will complete the technical development cycle and result in a powerful and low-priced product. We will continue to develop a novel system for high performance illumination, patterned in time and space. We will refine and fabricate a system for high performance data acquisition and processing, designed to support real-time confocal imaging. We will extend, further develop, evaluate and validate both static and adaptive algorithms used to reconstruct confocal images from a time series of spatially sub-sampled images. We will integrate component systems, to produce two configurations of the instrument. Phase III work will include development of documentation and a beta test program. The confocal systems developed with SBIR support will allow the collection of high quality confocal images in fluorescence, reflectance and transmission modes with equipment that can be inexpensively retrofit to existing microscopes, and will enable important new application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Hospital infections and antimicrobial resistance are scourges of modern society, affecting several million Americans annually and wasting billions of dollars. Timely, accurate data analysis is critical to preventing the spread of infection and resistance. Preliminary results show that treating clinical microbiology data as signals and applying various analytical techniques to them has tremendous potential to improve the detection of outbreaks and shifts in resistance early on, while the possibility for effective intervention still exists. Building on these results, this research aims to fully characterize at least five years of historical microbiology data from three prominent hospitals. This will be used as training data to optimize early detection techniques through the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) using a Linux supercomputing cluster. Surveys will be conducted of the infection control personnel before and after a one year trial of an early prototype real-time monitoring system to determine the impact such a system has on their ability to prevent the spread of infectious disease. Success will be measured by the survey results as well as by the number of outbreaks detected in a timely manner. This research will extend the scientific understanding of GAs, infectious disease surveillance, and cluster detection.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Anti-cancer immunization is limited by the poor immunogenicity of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) normally used for vaccination. This problem may be overcome by direct adenovirus-mediated delivery of TAAs to dendritic cells (DCs), which play a centralrole in the generation of the immune response. The specificity and efficiency of this vaccination strategy may be improved by specifically targeting the vectors to DCs. Therefore, we propose to develop an Ad vector targeted to CD40 molecules expressed onthe surface of DCs. In one approach, CD40-specific ligands, the natural CD40 ligand (CD40L) and an anti-CD40 single chain antibody, will be cross-linked to TAA-expressing Ad vectors by peptide zippers genetically incorporated into both the Ad capsid andthe ligand.  In an alternative approach, the human immunoglobulin Fc domain and the Z domain of S. aureus protein A will be incorporated into the ligand and the Ad fiber protein, respectively.  In both cases, the entire targeting complex is designed toself-assemble during the propagation of the Ad vector.  We hypothesize that this vector design will result in more efficient antigen presentation by DCs, thereby leading to significant improvements in anti-cancer immunization-based treatment strategies.The prostate-specific membrane antigen will be employed as a model TAA.",

The passive system, without electronics or moving parts, is based on a commercially availablehydrogen/air, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell that converts hydrogen directly to electricity. Hydrogen is generated by a chemical reaction of seawater with a hydroreactive material at the seawater temperature. The energy capacity of the system canbe tailored to produce from a few to several hundred kWh. The power generation system is designed for long-term operation without maintenance and produces power continuously on-demand. About 1.4 kWh of electrical energy is produced by SWAPS per kg of therechargeable reagent, at approximately $3/kWh. Byproducts of SWAPS are environmentally benign. This power system can also be used in various other low-power marine applications. The Phase I efforts include a low-risk design of an integrated prototype ofthe buoy power source to supply six (6) months of continuous electrical power at an average load of ~ 35 W. The range of possible power production is from zero to the maximum power output of the fuel cell.   It is anticipated that the NAVY will gain fromthis R&D; effort a new type of seawater activated, low electrical power source with an energy density of ~ 1.2 kWh/kg of the system weight.

Our approach takes advantage of telltale delayed response in the SAR dataproduced by radar energy that enters damage holes in recently fired-upon objects.  Our phase I work has provided us a theoretical understanding of these responses and demonstrated that they are present in real data at detectable levels.  For Phase II wewill develop algorithms that improve the contrast of the delayed responses with respect to the background clutter and improve detection performance.  Furthermore, we intend to develop a concept of operations (CONOPS) for using such techniques in currentlyfielded aircraft and radar systems.  Delayed responses may prove to be one of the most important BDA features because they can only be produced by an actual entry or exit hole in the target.  This contrast with other more indirect features that might yieldambiguous results in the event of near-hit explosions.  As far as we know, our detection approach is unique among the approaches being pursued by researches working to solve this challenge, however, we anticipate that our results will combinesynergistically with other proposed approaches.",

The information could be used to determine the event source location and depth, as well as its magnitude, and pertains to nuclear test ban treaty verification, seismology, and other scientific and national security applications.  This project will use a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to image, in real time, the surface Rayleigh wave from a seismic event as it propagates outward from the event hypocenter.  By interferometrically comparing this image to a later image of the same scene, a high-resolution picture of the structure of the seismic wave will be produced.  In Phase I, two independent approaches were used to explore the parameter space of seismic waves relative to the operational characteristic of SAR imaging systems.  The two approaches agreed well with one another and support the feasibility of real-time seismic imaging.  Phase II has three related components:  (1) a continuation of the theoretical analysis pursued in Phase I, (2) a physical experiment in which a large conventional explosion is imaged using airborne and spaceborne SAR systems, and (3) the development and delivery of a software package capable of analyzing and inverting real-time InSAR seismic data to source event characteristics such as bomb yield and event epicenter.  In combination these components will support, demonstrate, and deliver the capability to image and analyze seismic events in progress with unprecendented precision.                 Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  An InSAR seismic event imaging system should contribute substantially to nuclear test treaty verification as well as to several areas of study in solid earth geophysics that are relevant to seismic hazards mitigation and Earth structure determination.",

Expanding on establishedsynergies with a pending DARPA/DSO Tractability Demonstration Program (TDP), the SBIR Phase II will allow VEXTEC the opportunity to demonstrate the prognostic capability on a simulated engine disk component and validate the prediction results with acquiredtest data.  Also this Phase II will further address logistical concerns about the quality of data supplied by onboard sensors, data reliability, pre-processing or filtering requirements.  This project includes development of a parameter measurement system,refinements to physics-based life prediction models, conduct of prognostics demonstration, and results evaluation.",

The questions will take the form of rich dramatized multimedia simulations in which a series of decisions and observations must be made. The questions will be administered using the Computer Performance Based Assessment system developed by Videodiscovery, Inc. During Phase I, a skills matrix, an online engine, and six prototype events were developed. In Phase II, a comprehensive item bank will be created, tested, and validated. The proposed assessment will provide specific diagnostic information that will help health educators fine tune instruction for individual students and that will help administrators adjust and evaluate the effectiveness of programs. The program will also be used in the classroom as a learning tool giving students the chance to explore risky behaviors and their results. The program can be switched by the teacher from a purely assessment form to an assessment plus teaching format.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: (provided by the applicant) Our research goal is to develop and validate miniature impedance sensors which can quantify the osseointegration of dental and other implants nondestructively in vivo, from the time of placement onward. We have demonstrated that mechanical impedance correlates with clinical and histologic measures of osseointegration, and that a self-contained sensor/actuator package can detect time-varying impedance. We now propose using micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology to construct miniaturized impedance instruments which, encapsulated within implants and placed in dog mandibles, will yield noninvasive measurements during the healing and osseointegration process.  The implantable impedance-based osseointegration sensor (IIOS) offers a new and improved way to observe, study, predict, and enhance the osseointegration process. Originally conceived for dental implants, the principle can also be applied to other implants, tissues, or engineering structures.  Our aims comprise four tasks: (1) design and construct an implantable prototype using MEMS technology; (2) employ the prototype in vivo to characterize early-stage osseointegration; (3) conduct engineering studies of pivotal technical issues; and (4) design a human-qualified system for clinical research.  This continues a collaboration with the University of Alabama, Birmingham, and the University of California, Berkeley.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: A disposable, minimally invasive instrument for continuous measurement of the mechanical impedance (rigidity) of biological structures, with applications to: progressive osseointegration of dental implants; stability of other implants and biomimetic devices; feedback of muscle tone and tension for functional electrical (neuromuscular) stimultion.  Also significant applications to nondestructive monitoring of tension, integrity, or stability of non-biological structures.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The spectral band from 1 - 5THz contains a wealth of information about the chemistry of the upper atmosphere and the structure and evolution of the Universe. The recent development of superconductive hot electron bolometers (HEBs) has made it possible for NASA to cover this frequency band with high-resolution heterodyne receivers with exceptional sensitivity. As a critical additional benefit, the HEB mixers require extremely low levels of local oscillator (LO) power. In fact system requirements of as little as one to ten microwatts make it feasible for the mixers to be pumped with solid-state sources based on a fundamental oscillator and a cascaded chain of frequency multipliers. However, multipliers for above 1 THz, even at these power levels, remain a formidable challenge. In fact, a frequency multiplier for Band 6 of the Heterodyne Radiometer for Herschel, spanning from 1,410 - 1,910 GHz, has not yet been demonstrated. Thus, the problem we propose to solve is the lack of a source of terahertz power suitable for preent and future NASA missions. This will be achieved through the use of our innovative and unique frequency quintupler circuit design and our proprietary GaAs-on-quartz circuit integration process.",

The NODDIG concept is a software/hardware digital scene generator. It will complement and support infrared sensors under test by DTRA's Nuclear Optical Dynamic Display System (NODDS).  Presently available image generators areeither too slow or afford incomplete models of the burst-disturbed backgrounds from high-altitude nuclear events (HANEs). The IRSim code, developed and maintained by Visidyne, is the DTRA standard for producing high-fidelity structured scenes and scenesequences. However, IRSim is several orders of magnitude too slow to be used in \"real time\" for hardware-in-the-loop sensor testing. Other, faster stochastic methods have been used to generate background clutter images, but they lack the fidelity andtraceability inherent in DTRA's IRSim. In Phase I Visidyne demonstrated that nuclear background structure can be displayed on a PC at frame rates exceeding requirements using a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) 3-D graphics accelerator.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The polymer platform technology and the device design developed to date offer the long- term objective of a line of products that can be worn under the eyelid for a day or for months, and useful for a number of ocular conditions that would benefit from a more sustained, controlled and inherently compliant treatment than is available today via the use of eye drops. We have focused through Phase I and Phase II grant award periods on one specific product - a topical ophthalmic drug delivery device (TODDD ) delivering timolol, to treat glaucoma. Timolol is one of the most commonly used glaucoma drugs and is not patent protected. It has a long history of successfully lowering intraocular pressure (IOP), but has some significant ocular and systemic side effects when delivered in drop form. When delivered by TODDD, it should eliminate the incidence and severity of those side effects by continuously delivering a very low, preservative-free dose to the patient and virtually eliminating systemic absorption, as shown in the Phase II animal study. Of great importance to the mission of NEI of preventing vision loss from glaucoma, is that the product will address the 24-59% non-compliance rate among glaucoma patients using drops. This major clinical disadvantage is due mainly to difficult instillation, forgetfulness and undesirable side effects. In this proposed Phase II Renewal project, the goal is to show that the product can be safely and comfortably worn for 90+ days and deliver drug in humans, while addressing issues related to Federal regulatory approval processes. The specific aims of the project encompass the scientific and clinical regulatory requirements attendant to this goal, as well as executive management of the commercialization process. Work will continue on TODDD with timolol, along several scientifically driven regulatory fronts. These aims include design and mold optimization; manufacturing process scale-up, semi- automation and validation; analytical assay testing; sterilization process and testing; clinical product build; and design and conduct of a human design validation study, with one or two drug treatment arms. Our commercialization plan indicates a high degree of commercial potential, as it reflects specific input generated by the interest to date of potential investors and large ophthalmic companies. For example, our focus on a small human feasibility study, with at least one drug arm, is a direct result of this input. Our collaboration with the Massachusetts Medical Device Development (M2D2) Center at U. Mass. and its mission and coordination of resources also offer high potential of success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Glaucoma is a major ocular disease that severely impacts millions of people. Most are over fifty-five years of age and many have difficulty with instilling drops and suffer from poor compliance with a drops-based therapy. The TODDD product provides a more efficient, convenient and consistent means of drug delivery to the surface of the eye, and reduces the incidence and severity of side effects by delivering a lower, preservative-free dose to the patient and virtually eliminating systemic absorption. It will also reduce the current 24-59% level of non-compliance by remaining in the eye between physician visits (1).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Development of new and improved drugs to treat human illness is a costly and inefficient process. It costs over half a billion dollars to develop a compound into a medicine and more than 90% of compounds that enter human clinical trials fail usually due to unexpected toxicity. The attrition rate is even higher at the preclinical level where less than 1 in 10,000 drug \"hits\" successfully makes it to FDA approval. VistaGen, Inc. is developing a simple and reproducible screening technology for in vitro toxicity assessment, the Genesis ScreenTM. The system employs stem cells capable of differentiating into most tissues in the body. Once the cells are exposed to test compounds, toxicity is evaluated as changes in genomic and proteomic expression patterns as measured using cDNA microarrays and a protein SELDI-TOF microchip technology. This assay can rapidly prioritize drug \"hits\" based on a straightforward in vitro safety assessment. The objective of our previously funded phase I SBIR was to provide proof of principle of the Genesis Screen TM technology. We have successfully completed the goals of our phase I grant and in particular made major progress in developing proteomic fingerprints of toxic drugs. Furthermore, we have started to develop the biomathematics that will allow us to statistically compare the profiles of our library of molecular fingerprints of reference toxic drugs to test compounds to predict whether those test compounds are likely to be toxic or not. The objective of our Phase II application is to refine our assay to the point of bringing the Genesis ScreenTM system to the full-scale commercialization stage. We propose studies to increase the resolving power of our proteomic and genomic surrogate markers for selective classes of compounds with known toxicity. We will further develop the biomathematics component of the Genesis ScreenTM system These development studies will allow us to commercialize to the pharmaceutical industry a rapid and reliable high throughput Genesis ScreenTM system assay for prioritizing drug lead candidates based on toxicity assessment.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: There is a very pressing need in the pharmaceutical industry for technology that increases the efficiency of drug development via more effective clinically predictive assays.   Because drug development is so costly, working on a drug that will ultimately fail is enormously expensive.  Our screening system will allow predictive tox assessment early during drug development and will increase the efficiency of clinical trials.  The commercial version of this assay will be provided to the pharmaceutical industry as screening service.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a portable, noninvasive, personal blood glucose monitor. VivaScan has developed and successfully tested a laboratory prototype instrument based on the Optical Bridge TM (OB) method. The OB uniquely nulls out the background absorption of the sample, overcoming the major problem of optical blood glucose measurements. Our successful Phase I diabetic patient study produced 96% of the measurement data in the clinically acceptable A and B zones of the Clarke error grid. The aims for Phase II include: 1) enhance electronics with microcontroller; 2) redesign and miniaturize the optics and device mechanics; 3) investigate the use of optical interference filters for acousto-optical tunable filters (AOTF) substitutes; 4) replace expensive AOTF, used for wavelength generation, with less expensive devices; 5) further enhance the glucose measurement algorithms; and 6) build four portable devices and test their performance with patients. Overall, the goal of the proposed work is to extend our laboratory prototype system to a patient oriented device, with improved accuracy, portability, ease of operation and affordability. Subsequent FDA approval of a practical portable in-home blood glucose monitor will be sought, allowing diabetic patients to noninvasively and painlessly monitor their glucose levels throughout the day.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Our market analysis suggests that from 500,000 to 4.4 million diabetic individuals could use a non-invasive glucose monitor. The global market would increase these projections by a factor of 2 or more.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A need has long existed for a capability to calculate, simulate and predict the electromagnetic field of an anechoic chamber.  This capability is realized in Voss Scientific's BAC-SIM (Benefield Anechoic Chamber Simulation Software), but the ultimate goalof perfect simulation has proved challenging.  The biggest obstacle to accurate simulation is the lack of adequate information about the chamber configuration.  We propose a new paradigm: instead of attempting to compute the anechoic chamber's field solelyby deterministic means, we propose a combination of deterministic and statistical techniques to characterize a chamber's electromagnetic properties.  In Phase I, we have worked out a methodology for statistically describing the electromagnetic fielddistribution of an anechoic chamber, and in Phase II we will implement a suite of tools that result in statistical-based figures of merit to quantify chamber performance.  The Phase II program will also include the additions of: the capability to model theelectromagnetic scattering from multiple objects in a chamber, advanced data visualization capabilities, integrated analysis methods for simulation and measured chamber data, and the addition of electromagnetic models for common chamber equipment.Finally, the Phase II effort will include extensive validation of the chamber simulation software consisting of analytical and measured elements.",

This could be called a 5-D vascular imaging system (x y z v t), operating at 30 FPS. In addition, the threedimensional blood vessel centerline was instantaneously acquired, tracked and displayed as needed for true 3-D vector velocity and for non-invasive measurement and monitoring of blood volume flow. The 3D image can be fully rotated andlor viewed as a fixed or moving slice in any axis. The Phase I Engineering Model used a small transducer array, with a limited angular field of view, to produce 200,000 voxels/sec with a fantastic 4x improvement in velocity (color) resolution over 2D systems. In Phase II, VueSonix will fully reduce its invention (patent pending, submitted 6/99 81 7/99) to practice by building and testing a prototype system with a full-size probe producing images with 12 times the number of voxels as the engineering model. The prototype will be optimized for the peripheral vascular market and will be clinically tested at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Cardiac imaging will also be evaluated.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Vuesonix is developing commercial ultrasound devices that image blood vessels in real time 3D. The objective is to provide superior blood flow imaging with volume blood-flow measurements resulting in improved diagnosis requiring less operator skill. A market survey performed for VueSonix by Health Advances, Inc., shows a $350M-550M market in the U.S. for a device to diagnose and monitor periphral vascular disease that requires less tiem and less operator skill.",

LiveInk software enables readers to manipulate the text appearance based on linguistic attribut tags that are embedded in the parsed text output. The Phase I SBIR LiveInk project demonstrated that real-time text parsing can be delivered over the Internet, to instantly boost reading power for any reader, anywhere, with any text. Phase I also demonstrated new classroom benefits of LiveInk, immediately improving oral fluency and writing, and making challenging content mor accessible to students. The proposed Phase II project will commercialize LiveInk, by expanding its server-based parsing capacity for high volume use and adding point & click definitions, and will develop new classroom interventions in Social Science and Language Arts that will be validated with a year long controlled study over 1000 high school students, using nationally standardized reading and achievements test.

A solution is to replace thelegacy antenna with a relatively inexpensive smart antenna appliqu to null out the jam.  This smart antenna should be a direct replacement for the current antenna, without any change to the receiver, and with minimal consumption of battery power.  A jamindicator and interference signal level measurement can be provided with manual activation of antijam operation only when jam is detected.  In Phase-I, Wang Electro-Opto Corporation (WEO) successfully demonstrated the feasibility of such an antennaappliqu for GPS L1 band.  We propose a Phase-II program to expand the design to cover both L1 and L2 bands.  Two approaches will be taken, one using conventional antennas, and the other using WEO's patented miniaturized slow-wave antenna.  Brassboardantenna appliqu with jam sensor and indicator with low power-consumption will be developed.",

Using a SISVS, the SATS pilot will be presented with information, not data. The pilot can develop situational awareness with less need for mental integration of disparate data, thus enabling less highly trained, non-professional pilots to fly safely in all weather and lighting conditions, and all phases of flight.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         WaveBand Corporation proposes a novel focal plane array sensor for millimeter wave (MMW) imaging. The major innovation is the monolithic integration of printed fractal-like antennas, pyroelectric capacitors, and MEMS switches in a single wafer. Pyroelectric sensors have low sensitivity in the MMW range of the spectrum. The proposed integration of pyroelectric capacitors with printed broad-band antennas will dramatically improve sensitivity. The preliminary design and calculations performed in the course of the Phase I Project have shown that the minimum detectable temperature contrast is less than 1 K. A MEMS switch incorporated in the antenna/capacitor circuit will act as a chopper, eliminating the need for that cumbersome device. The goal of Phase II of the Project is to build a working prototype of the proposed imager (with support of Raytheon?s foundry for the manufacturing process). The final result of Phase II will be the creation of a very efficient low-cost MMW imager whose sensitivity is comparable to that of the best IR sensors. The combination of WaveBand?s MMW circuitry and a pyroelectric thermal sensor makes it possible to overcome the main problem of MMW thermal sensors, their low sensitivity caused by the small power of thermal radiation in the MMW frequency range.",

TYCOR materials are ideally suited for structural applications that require low cost, damage tolerant composite sandwich panels. WebCore's patentedprocess integrates dry glass or carbon fiber reinforcements in a three-dimensional geodesic architecture through the thickness of low-density foam. TYCOR materials are designed for low-cost vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process, where theporous fiber reinforcements act as resin flow channels during molding and the entire core and skin assembly co-cures to produce an integrated robust structure.The initial work done in Phase I has shown significant promise and proven the feasibility of manufacturing UAV airframe components with TYCOR composite materials in VARTM process.  Phase II work will involve development of automated manufacturing process,materials testing and design database, design and analysis tools, quality assurance methods and VARTM molding process for TYCOR materials and products.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose to utilize the multimedia and hypertext capabilities of the World Wide Web to develop a complete, comprehensive set of resources to facilitate multi- university, interdisciplinary collaborative research dealing with any of the Complex Genetic Disorders. In order to develop these resources, a virtual private research network will be developed for one representative complex genetic disorder, namely, autism. Accordingly, this application encompasses the development of a Web-based Virtual Private Research Network for Genetic Studies of Autism (VPRN-GA) that will represent the collaborative endeavors of WebSciences and the currently constituted multi-institutional Collaborative Linkage Study of Autism (CLSA) which includes investigators at Tufts, Vanderbilt, the University of Iowa and Duke. Further expansion of the network may include eight other funded groups who are just beginning a collaboration on autism genetics via an R-13 Conference Grant (two via NIMH, and others via NINDS, NICHD, a private foundation, the Canadian MRC, a French/Swedish organization, and the British MRC and NICHD). This Phase I application focuses on developing static Web page templates for the organization and flow of information dealing with the online submission, review, discussion, evaluation, manipulation, etc., of data and documents (manuscripts); in addition, online communication and bibliographic services for the VPRN-GA will be developed. The VPRN-GA will be evaluated originally by the CLSA investigators, who will function as users/beta-testers. On the basis of the preceding, the accompanying Fast- Track Phase II application will provide for the transformation of static Web pages to a database-driven, fully functional VPRN-GA on the World Wide Web. Also included in the Phase II application is a comprehensive plan for commercialization of the software responsible for the VPRN-GA. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: We anticipate that the primary commercial contribution to sustain the VPRN-GA will arise from the sale of the software that provides for an integrated set of functionalities for collaborative research on autism, complex genetic disorders, molecular biology, etc. Certain of these functionalities will be marketed as individual components, for example, the submission, review and evaluation of molecular biological images on the Web and collaborative interactions associated with these images. Additional revenue will come from sponsorships and advertising. A description of the potential sources of funding support are presented in the Phase II Appendix: Product Development Plan.",

Ship masker systems are acousticcountermeasures that utilize air bubbles to mask potentialtargets.  Masker systems work by reducing radiated noise from asurface ship by injecting air bubbles into water adjacent to thewet surface of a ship. The large difference in the speed ofsoundbetween the air bubbles and the surrounding water make them veryefficient as reflectors of acoustic energy.BENEFITS: If the bubble screens produced by ship masker systems can be proven effective in reducing the vulnerability of surface combatants to underwater shock originating from an exploding mine, there would alsobe a benefit to the commercial shipping industry. Cargo ships transporting hazardous materials and supertankers carrying huge volumes of oil face similar threats from the global proliferation of mines.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV produces dramatic reductions in morbidity and mortality for many individuals who maintain a very high level of adherence to their medications.  Between 20 and 33 percent of HIV-seropositive patients will miss at least one of their medication doses over a 1 to 3 day period. To improve patient adherence, we must accurately assess non-adherence and intervene to enhance adherence. Patient self-report is the most practical method for assessing   adherence, but may produce unreliable and invalid results unless optimally  performed. A computer-assisted, self-administered adherence program could  improve HIV-seropositive patients' adherence behaviors by accurately and  efficiently assessing their medication adherence, delivering an adherence   intervention to patients, and producing adherence reports for providers.  Patients could routinely complete the program with minimal use of valuable and  costly medical staff time. By providing a neutral and seemingly private            \r  interview, computer programs may increase patient disclosure of non-adherence.     In Phase I, we successfully developed a computerized HIV medication assessment that identified serious patient medication errors and non-adherence. Phase II efforts will be directed toward simplifying the adherence assessment, developing the intervention component of the adherence program, and testing the complete program's efficacy in reducing regimen misunderstandings and enhancing patient adherence.",

An advantageof the method is that attenuation is obtained ratiometrically -thus, the method is self-calibrating, independent of fluctuationsin source intensity, the relative sensitivities of the detectors,and the magnitude of backscattering.

These sampling systems require the development of innovative deployment strategies, multi-sensor sampling packages with integrated acquisition, and software networks designed for automated and integrated processing.In response, we propose to develop a self-contained, compact, in-situ optical measurement system, the DOLPHIN (Diving OpticaL Profiler and High-speed Integration Network). The sampling package will be a towed profiler to maximize spatial coverage. Data acquisition and processing will be automated. A water sampling system will additionally pump water to the vessel for laboratory analyses.The towed sampling package will provide a continuous set of calibration points for validation, instead of a single point (station) as typically obtained from a ship. Equally important, substantial time and money will be saved by the research community by purchasing a sampling system already equipped with complete sensor integration and automated processing.At the end of Phase-I we expect to have design work for the system completed. We will construct and test all DOLPHIN components in Phase-II. Phase-II will culminate in a completely operational system transitioned to a commercial product.",

Using excitation-emission matrix fluorometry, the sensor will enable in-situ simultaneous detection and effective analytical separation of individual biogeochemical components present in seawater, including humic substances, hydrocarbons, proteins, wastewater/sewage, and other natural and anthropogenic substances. Excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) will be measured at sampling rates on the order of a second. No scanning of the monochromators, in fact no moving parts whatsoever, will be required. The technological innovation making this possible is termed Double Dispersion Imaging (DDI). The sensor software will incorporate real-time, automated quantum corrections and 2-D mixing analysis techniques. Design goals emphasize portability, compactness, ruggedness, and enabling flexible deployment through features such as variable sampling rates and memory storage capabilities. No current sensor for oceanographic deployment has these characteristics. If feasibility is demonstrated, the XMF is expected to be a powerful analytical tool for investigating biogeochemical processes that we feel will realistically mark a turning point in the analytical oceanic measurement capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Nonulcer dyspepsia is a highly prevalent medical condition affecting up to 30 percent of the Western population, accounting for 2-5 percent of all visits to primary care physicians and leads\r to over one billion dollars worth of upper endoscopy procedures per year. In an\r attempt to lower this tremendous burden on the health care system the general\r practice currently is to attempt to avoid endoscopy in the majority of\r patients, which are low risk, by an initial empiric trial of medication.\r Endoscopy can then be performed on those that fail initial therapy.\r Unfortunately, empiric treatment is only effective in about 40-50 percent of\r cases since it is difficult to determine in advance the most effective\r treatment. Consequently the high cost of endoscopy continues to be a problem.\r The overall goal of this project is to develop an inexpensive, non-invasive\r test for the objective and quantitative categorization of nonulcer dyspepsia\r patients with the purpose of providing the most effective initial treatment.\r The effectiveness of objective patient categorization will be tested with\r respect to ability to predict which patients will be responders to acid\r suppression therapy and which will be responsive to prokinetic treatment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract is a major clinical problem. Bleeding may be acute and severe or it may be chronic and unnoticed (i.e. occult bleeding). The acute bleeding is a medical emergency that needs to be evaluated and treated immediately. Occult bleeding may be a sign of colon cancer and demands a careful evaluation to avoid missing a cancer in a curable stage. An initial and important determination in the medical management of either type of gastrointestinal bleeding is the localization of the bleeding site to either the upper or the lower gastrointestinal tract. During the Phase I portion of this project we developed a simple in vitro test for the analysis of blood in stool samples. This test was designed to determine, from a stool sample, whether bleeding was from an upper or lower gastrointestinal site. The objective of this Phase II project is to confirm the clinical accuracy and usefulness of this test with a large prospective group of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding in a clinical environment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65164     The detection and discrimination of seismic events while monitoring for small nuclear explosions is complicated by a significant amount of commercial mining explosions.  Although mining explosion databases have been constructed to help with this problem in various regions of the world, very little is known about the contribution of mining activity in southern Asia to the regional seismicity.  This project will develop an extensive ground truth database for southern Asia that includes mining explosions and rock burst data, using data currently being collected in the region along with previously developed location algorithms and velocity models.  In Phase I, a mining database for southern Asia was developed that includes over 230 mines and mineral deposits for the region.  Seismic waveform data from stations in India were collected, and waveform correlation techniques were used to identify mining explosions.  These explosions were located using single-station location methods combined with maps and overhead satellite imagery.  The resulting waveform and mining resources were combined into a preliminary mining database for the study region.  Phase II will finish the development of the mining resources component of the database, and analyze new sources of data, including stations in northwestern India and Pakistan, in order to examine the mining seismicity near the nuclear test sites.                Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The ground truth database should allow for improved seismic event discrimination and improved seismic event location in southern Asia.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Large corporations are increasingly looking to purchase behavioral interventions for employee wellness programs; however, although many interventions have been demonstrated to cost-effectively improve health outcomes, few commercially viable products are available. Hostility and anger expression style have been demonstrated as risk factors for hypertension, itself a risk factor for CHD. Recent research suggests that anger management training reduces blood pressure, and leads to improvement in psychosocial risk factors, e.g., depression. The Williams LifeSkills workshop, based on the book \"Anger Kills\", and its successor, \"Lifeskills\", has shown in pilot studies to improve psychosocial risk factors, and is currently marketed in a limited manner to corporations and government agencies. The marketability of this product, however, would be far greater if supported by extended research demonstrating its effects on blood pressure reduction, as well as showing, in a corporate setting, decreased hostility and depressive symptoms, as well as strong cost-effectiveness, compared with standard care procedures recommended by JNC-VI guidelines. We propose a randomized controlled trial test of the Williams LifeSkills workshop in a hospital setting. We hypothesize that employees who undertake the LifeSkills workshop will show improved blood pressure, psychosocial risk factors, and decreased costs associated with treatment. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Psychosocial risk factors have been strongly related to many health problems, notably CVD. Research has shown that behavioral interventions have great promise to ameliorate the distress, the health- damaging effects and the costs associated with these risk factors; but few such programs have been implemented in a large-scale way. Corporations are increasingly interested in providing such services, but they have had difficulties in knowing which programs are most effective. Until these programs are developed as commercially viable products, dissemination of these programs will be hindered. In sum; these findings make a strong case that the development of a protocol- driven behavioral intervention package that can be delivered in a wide range of corporate settings presents a remarkable commercial opportunity.",

Theobjective of this proposal is to continue the development of the Smart damage control boundary opening system, initiated during Phase I. During Phase I, a prototype smart door system consisting of shape memory alloy actuators, magnetic gasket, wirelesssensors, and RF circuitry was demonstrated successfully. In Phase II, the design of all modules will be refined, fabricated, integrated and tested in 'real-world' conditions. Based on our Phase I feasibility study, the proposed composite door structure canwithstand higher pressures than existing doors. All the ship doors can be closed at once without manual intervention in less than 10 seconds. Also, the supporting wedges can be actuated remotely in a few milliseconds. The new SMA actuated sealing andclosing mechanisms provide enhanced functionality such as remote opening/closure of doors, an efficient watertight/airtight seal at higher pressures, and minimal maintenance. The electrical unit of the Smart Door system consisting of wireless sensors,advanced signal processing routines, RF transmission and networking enables continuous monitoring of the ship environment, thus improving the safety on the ship.BENEFITS: The components that make up t",

Culture devices, such as stirred-tank and hollow fiber bioreactors, have utility in large-scale production, but are impractical and cost prohibitive at the research scale. Traditional roller bottles have been used successfully for small to mid-scale production of recombinant proteins, viral vectors, and therapeutic cell doses, but are labor intensive, typically requiring more than ten devices for each desired product. The Enhanced Roller Bottle (ERB) is a practical, cost effective cell culture device designed to improve culture productivity. The ERB increased cell production 4- to 9-fold over the traditional roller bottle by increased surface area for cell attachment and increased availability of culture medium due to its gas permeable walls. In the proposed Phase II studies, the ERB will be optimized for the production of anchorage-dependent cells and cell-secreted products. ERB parameters requiring investigation include gas transfer, scaffold configuration and material, inoculation methods, operating conditions, and product recovery. At the completion of Phase II, the ERB will be targeted to manufacturers of small and mid-scale culture devices for the production of cells or cell products for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",

This limits their effectiveness to other team members.  The goal of SOCOM in the next generation is to permit onthe move hands free RF detection by way of a Body-Worn Antenna Vest.  It is envisioned that the SOF user would attach a receiver and a power source onto his belt or in his backpack, then connect the receiver via a flexible coaxial cable at a single pointon the vest.The objective of this SBIR Program is to design the antenna into common existing SOF tactical web gear or protective vest, such as the SPEARS BALCS.  The vest can contain a variety of antennas, with the RF combining into a single output that will meetfrequency range, VSWR, and directional requirements.  Additional capabilities to be investigated include the abilities to transmit communications signals, to operate in the prone position, as well as to receive satellite transmissions (e.g. globalpositioning system).The effort in phase II will be directed toward the development of several functional prototypes:  an initial vest antenna prototype constructed using production representative materials, followed by a fully DF-functional SOF version, and finally a civilianversion.  Validation will be initially performed via an existing DF system test bed, then by integration with available COTS DF tactical receivers.",

Phase IIwill further this research by integrating the Combined Aerospace Operations Center (CAOC) tools at AFRL within an overarching knowledge management environment called the Command and Control Expermentation Assessment Support Environment (C2EASE).  Thisenvironment will support programmable intelligent agents assigned to discover and report system configuration information within each of the CAOC entities.  Additionally, this information will be used during problem reporting and enhancement suggestionreporting by the operational user.  Information flows will be transparent to the end users and driven by automated workflow management.  This Phase II research will provide both strategies and technologies to accomplish Real Time Knowledge Management,Information Integration, and Dynamic Collaboration resulting in a greater sense of enterprise awareness and facilitate management of the CAOC as a weapon system.",

There remains, however, little commonality at the aircraft/store application software level.  Some government estimates attribute approximately 40 percent of the non-recurring cost of aircraft/store integration to softwaredevelopment, indicating that substantial additional savings could be achieved through enhanced commonality and standardization in these application level interfaces.  In fact, increased standardization in aircraft/store software interface softwareincluding the incorporation of such commercial techniques as plug and play capabilities was specifically recommended by a 1999 NATO Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG) study of potential interoperability improvements.  The proposed effort would furtherdevelop the open architecture store integration software concept defined under Phase I, demonstrate key elements of the associated software framework in a realistic example application, and coordinate relevant issues with the international aircraft/storeintegration community.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Phase II objective is to deliver two commercial products: 1) variational analysis software that can produce optimized DEM maps for any region along the US coast; and 2) hurricane flood atlases for any coastal area.These atlases will not only include higher-resolution storm surge simulations but rainfall effects as well. For flash flood mapping, the well-established HEC software program will be obtained from the Hydrologic Engineering Center of the US Army Corps of Engineers. These maps will have overlaid roads and detailed coastline information. Product evaluation partners will provide guidance on how to make the graphical output easy to interpret for their use.It is important to note the power and versatility of variational analysis - non-conventional variables (in this case, optical pixel brightness and backscatter) can be incorporated into a cost function to find the optimized solution for an unrelated variable (in this case, elevation).The current implementation of variational analysis yields desirable improvements to bare-earth estimation in several key areas, while other aspects require more work. There are also validation uncertainties due to a lack of ground truth that hampers both the development of the algorithm and in validation efforts. These shortcomings will be addressed in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Space rigidizable and deployable structures with ultra-lightweight, high rigidity, and space durability are desirable to improve the reliability and affordability of space structures. Some of the components currently in use like shelters or space stations use double-walled thick films with high internal pressure. All these hollow components are often vulnerable in space because debris and meteorites can strike them. They will lose their functions if hit and damaged by foreign objects. We propose to fill the cavities of these hollow components with an ultra-lightweight cold hibernated elastic memory (CHEM) or a shape memory polymer (SMP) foam that can rigidize the space structure in space so that it can maintain its functions even when struck by debris. In our phase I research, we have successfully processed ultra-lightweight microcellular CHEM foams using an environmentally friendly technique. These microcellular CHEM foams have much higher mechanical properties than those processed by the conventional techniques. We have also performed tests and proved that the microcellular CHEM foams did recover their original shapes after compaction and stowage. This capability allowed them to be packed into a very small volume, recover their shapes and be rigidized in space, thereby considerably reducing the launching cost yet providing high rigidity for space structures. The objectives proposed in the Phase I work plan have been accomplished. In this Phase II research we will scale-up the processing of the microcellular CHEM foams, further reduce their density, and optimize their mechanical properties as well as processing conditions.",

EFF facilitates a ?virtual platform? concept which lowers total mission risk, increases science data collection and adds considerable mission flexibility. The requirement to act as a unified information system places requirements on the system architecture that go above an beyond what is required for traditional systems. We propose a software based infrastructure that facilitates dependable formation and operation of distributed real-time control systems with several innovations that advance the state of the art in distributed systems technology and sensor webs. These innovations include: 1) cold start algorithms that allow for autonomous, dependable system organization and formation, 2) distributed on-line configuration control, monitoring and health assessment processes that operate in concert across the entire system allowing for coordinated system operation, 3) a multi-level scheduling approach that allows for distributed control elements to be responsive to local events and to participate in system wide coordinated operations and 4) a robust fault/error model that accounts for arbitrary fault/error cases and anomalies, thereby providing superior fault tolerance, particularly for Single event Upsets (SEUs).",

This interconnect design will improve the performance of hybrid RF MEMS sub-systems that use separate substrates for RF circuitry and actuator fabrication. MEMS relays will be assembled and packaged using the interconnect in order to determine the effectiveness of the technology for improving mm-wave performance. XCom Wireless expects RF MEMS relays to be fundamental components of future multi-band, high-performance, low-cost antenna systems, proposing the design, prototype, and testing of this interconnect technology. XCom Wireless is presently developing a new type of RF MEMS relay under Department of Defense contracts, which promises superior reliability to that of competing RF MEMS development efforts. The XCom Wireless vision is to enable the design of modular, multi-functional, high-performance antennas, for a dramatic reduction in system cost, weight, volume and power consumption. Within such a vision, the specific needs of NASA remote sensing programs can be furthered; upon the completion of this Phase II program, the results of interconnect technology development will form an important foundation for low cost mm-wave systems capable of high performance and functionality.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65872       Efforts in nuclear nonproliferation, nuclear threat reduction, and counter terrorism require the detection of radionuclides at concentrations close to background levels.  Enhanced isotope identification capabilities would increase the resolution for a number of telltale isotopes, enabling inspectors to verify nuclear events with greater accuracy. Also, security personnel would have a better tool to identify suspicious materials in the field, or determine whether prohibited materials were handled within suspicious terrorist facilities.  This project addresses this problem by developing a portable instrument that uses coincidence spectroscopy with two gamma detectors and one beta detector.  In Phase I, a compact PCI/PXI 4-channel spectrometer card for coincidence spectroscopy was designed.  Prototypes showed excellent temperature stability and the capability to operate with any kind of radiation detector.  Phase II will produce a compact PCI/PXI-based developer kit for multichannel coincidence spectroscopy.  A portable, low-level radiation and isotope detector, the size of a briefcase, will be produced that contains all necessary detector and electronics components including an embedded computer.  All necessary software for data acquisition, analysis, presentation, and report generation will be provided.          Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should result in a class of radiation detection and identification instruments that would acquire more precise and useful data to aid and support national security personnel, as well as security and forensics experts.",

Present deformable mirror technology, provides 3 to 4 microns stroke with a full amplitude bandwidthapproaching 500-Hz. It has been a design criteria that as the bandwidth increased, the amplitude decreased specific to a power spectral density profile set forth for the application. Recent test results have shown that present mirrors are limited by theability of the actuators to withstand the high peak current loads required for the high gain bandwidth operational mode. It is the intent of the proposed program to develop a new Single Crystal Photonex Mirror capable of 8 to 10-microns stroke with a fullamplitude bandwidth approaching 8 KHz. It is the intent of the proposed program to develop a mirror that is compatible with current linear amplifier technology while producing high gain bandwidth. It is a further objective to develop a deformable mirrorsystem with a compact, lightweight physical size to enable the layout of optical systems, which fit current tactical packages. The final objective is to develop a modular manufacturing process, which not only maintains the current industrial base but alsoenables scaling and production for future systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         NASAs Origin Program strategic plans call for direct imaging optical telescopes to evolve from 8 to 30 to 100 meter apertures by 2025. Indirect measurements using long baseline interferometers require Angstrom level precision for long durations. High data rate communications for spatial acquisition and tracking systems require active mirrors and up-down transmission compensation. Fundamental to NASAs vision of the future is high-density deformable mirrors which enable highly corrected optical systems and structures in space. These high-channel count deformable mirrors use very high-density actuator arrays and new 3D ceramic fabrication techniques to allow contrast enhancement for planetary imaging and correct system-wide optical errors within the telescope. The large, lightweight structures envisioned demand ultra high-density deformable mirrors. These will perform the necessary correction without sacrificing size or weight. Xinetics Photonex mirror modules have demonstrated 1 mm actuator spacing with array size of 21 x 21. Larger modules with arrays up to 128 x 128 will greatly simplify the optical systems and provide even greater capabilities. Xinetics proposes developing a 32 x 32 array of actuators with 0.5 mm spacing. This will significantly enhance the current capabilities by providing over 1.3 times as many actuators in only 75% of the size.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The multiplexer electronics represent a true breakthrough in adaptive-optics technology. Xinetics has developed the multiplexer system to take advantage of the properties of the PMN actuators. The high dielectric constant of PMN actuatorsmeans that any charge placed on an actuator remains there essentially forever until it finds a discharge path. This implies that fabricating a suitable switching system allows a single amplifier channel to address thousands of actuators. The trade-off has to do with the overall system speed, but for spaced-based imaging applications speed is not critical.The current SBIR took the results from previous programs one-step further by reducing the system noise and increasing the digital resolution. Xinetics has successfully demonstrated the low-noise concepts under this program. The major issues raised in Phase I are: charge injection in solid state switches, and optimizing analog and digital algorithms for robust charge transfer control. Results show a 1-lsb differentiation between adjacent channels within the test system. These results are extremely encouraging for a Phase II program where we will develop a single-board 1024-channel driver system with 16-bit input with 1-bit of resolution.",

As a result commercially available mammography units all employ low ratio grids to reduce the effects of scatter and image contrast. However, conventional mammography grids are limited in their ability to control scatter, particularly for thick dense breasts, and marked improvement in image contrast is possible with more efficient scatter control. Such improvements have been demonstrated with high ratio, high primary transmission grids. However, these grids have to move through a large distance to suppress grid artifacts, are bulky, and have limited patient positioning flexibility. Described as a practical and compact high ratio, high primary transmission mammography grid system. In Phase I the feasibility of such an approach was demonstrated. The goals in Phase II are to design and fabricate a high ratio, high primary transmission grid system; to evaluate its performance with phantoms; and to demonstrate its clinical utility.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to meet the demand from the microelectronics industry for improved wafer contamination analysis. Wafer contamination control is critical for Ultra Large Scale Integrated (ULSI) technology and there is a strong demand for a non-destructive analytical tool with improved sensitivity and spatial resolution over the conventional total x-ray fluorescence (TXRF) method. A new technique, focused beam TXRF, can meet this important market need. Based on point-focusing toroidal crystal optics, focused beam TXRF will improve the spatial resolution by a factor of more than 100 and provide 30 times better detection sensitivity for local contaminants on Si as compared to the conventional TXRF method. This technique also has potential for low-level Al, Na and other low Z elements analysis on Si that cannot be addressed effectively by the conventional TXRF and other techniques. In this project, preliminary focused beam TXRF data will be collected using WL1 excitation provided by a toroidal Si (220) crystal to demonstrate the improvement of sensitivity and resolution for transition metal detection. Theoretical calculation will be also carried out to determine the feasibility for Al and Na detection for wafer contamination control at 10^ 9 to 10^10 atoms/cm^2 level. Focused beam TXRF analysis has commercial applications in the microelectronics industry for wafer contamination control including localized and homogeneous contaminants with high resolution. These contaminants include many important elements such as transition metals, Al, Na and other low Z elements. By being able to identify these contaminants, the quality of silicon wafers can be improved. This will be a tremendous cost savings to a multi-billion dollar industry",

This tool, based on innovative, large-aperture, doubly-curved crystal optics, is capable of detecting ppb levels of transition metal and heavy elements with a spatial resolution of a few micrometers. This would assist in the research of Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s diseases, prostate cancer and other medical issues. This can also be a relatively inexpensive tool for the screening and monitoring of environmental and occupational exposure of toxic elements. The Phase I research has been very successfully completed and the feasibility of the MMXRF has been clearly demonstrated. In this Phase II project, a prototype desktop MMXRF system will be developed that incorporates an interchangeable modular x-ray beam unit to probe samples with different x-ray energies.

Oxidation state determination of intracellular Cr will provide important information relevant to exposure and risk assessment, and for understanding the mechanism of Cr carcinogenesis. We propose measuring the intracellular oxidation state of Cr using x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Until now, the XANES technique was not very practical, relying on costly synchrotrons. This valuable technique could be implemented using a lower power cost-effective system incorporating a revolutionary toroidal crystal optic. XOS has successfully carried out the Phase I research and demonstrated the feasibility of Cr oxidation determination using a table-top XANES system operated with samples in air. In this Phase II project, a fully optimized system will be designed. Human cells will be prepared in culture mediums and treated with Cr exposure. The reduction of Cr(Vl) to Cr(lll) will be monitored using the XANES system. The practical application of this XANES technique for clinical research and its commercialization will be evaluated. This would make available, for the first time, a broad chemical-state measurement capability covering most of the periodic table in a compact, low-power table-top system for medical, research, and industrial applications.",

The most energy dense rechargeable batteries currently available are Li-ion batteries, yet the high cost of these batteries has prevented their commercial use.  A significant cost driver of these batteries is the cost of the lithium salt in the electrolyte.  This project will utilize low-cost starting materials to produce low-cost lithium salts for use in Li-ion batteries.  In Phase I, a new class of lithium salts was developed for Li-ion batteries.  The salts offer the potential for significant cost saving over the current industry standard and showed good performance characteristics including conductivities as high as 4.8 mS/cm, electrochemical stability from 0 V to > 4.5 V, excellent solubility, and compatibility with standard Li-ion cell electrode materials.  Phase II will scale up the synthesis of the lithium salts developed in Phase I and continue the investigation of other related salts.  The salts will be tested in 7 Ah or greater size Li-ion cells to evaluate performance and to demonstrate their utility in electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications.                   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The lower cost Li salt technology should make Li-ion batteries more affordable and commercially viable in electric and hybrid electric vehicles.  Other applications include computers, cell phones, and satellites.",

The phase II effort will see the fabrication, testing and operation of a fully functional prototypedesign.The proposed system design consists of a small towed pod approximately 5 feet in length and 7\" in diameter, connected to a tow cable whose length is controlled by a reeling system installed inside the main research vessel (leaving wing store pylons freefor other instrumentation). Data communications with the tow vehicle can utilize a fiber optic connection (Preferred) or an RF radio link (Optional) in order to easily integrate with the existing main research vessel's data network.After successful field trials under phase II, several opportunities for commercialization of the project exist, including military applications and multi-level atmospheric sampling.BENEFITS: The towed atmospheric measurement system developed in the Phase II effort will immediately benefit the CIRPAS Twin Otter platform by providing for low level sampling of atmospheric flux.

Further upgrade of ZONA7U to a high-fidelity panel method ZONAIR is proposed in order to enhance the universality of the aerodynamic capability with:  1) unified AIC for hypersonic/supersonic/subsonic Mach numbers; 2) exact paneling to modelOML surface; 3) high AoA flow; 4) corrected location/strength of impinged shocks; 5)two-body interference aerodynamics.  Other proposed improvements of the erothermoelastic software include:  i) incorporation of AEROHEAT to replace SHABP with ZONAIR andZSTREAM;  ii) optimized TPS sizing procedure using complex variable differentiation sensitivity with MINIVER/EXIT; iii) applying temperature mapping onto structural FEM.  The structural optimizer ASTROS* is used throughout for sizing TAV/TPS whilemaintaining the TPS design as a part of the load-carry structure.  The TPS design adopts POST/OTIS for trajectory optimization in the outmost design cycle, thereby leafing to a final minimized fuel and weight objective.

        "abstract": "Abstract         In May 1999, a Licensing Agreement between Zonagen, Inc. and the NICHD was finalized to develop new 19-substituted-norprogestins. If the new antiprogestins behave as tissue-specific modulators in the manner of selective estrogen response modulators (SERMs), they may be recognized as an analogous class of drugs, i.e., as SPRMs. Such SPRMs discovered by NICHD and realized as drugs through this SBIR, would bring the results of government-sponsored science into the public domain. We expect that the new generation of compounds will be used for a number of indications where the etiology is dominated by progesterone. Tissues of the reproductive system such as pituitary, breast, myometrium, cervix, and endometrium remain obvious target organs for treatment. Their potential for use in labor and delivery and in breast cancer remains high. The following document outlines experiments to be performed under Phase II of an SBIR that would clarify the properties of these new SPRMs and enhance their utility for the treatment of endometriosis. It was the intention of Phase I of this SBIR program to determine effects on the eutopic endometrium of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) following short-term administration, of our lead compound, CDB-4124. We did not believe SPRMs could affect ectopic lesions (endometriosis) if there was no effect on eutopic endometrium. We found that our lead compound had effects on the endometrium similar to RU 486 but without evidence of effects on ovulation and without raising cortisol. We established methods and the baseline levels of markers of inflammation in the peritoneal cavity of the monkey. We intend to expand this program in Phase II to determine whether the same compound will reduce the size of endometriosis-like lesions in the same species. This animal model has been shown to respond to both GnRH agonists and to RU 486 with a decrease in lesion size. The use of GnRH agonists in women for the amelioration of endometriosis, although far from ideal, is one of the few medical therapies currently available. The primary outcome parameters will be alterations in the growth of ectopic endometrium and effects on hormones with our lead antiprogestin compound, CDB-4124. The secondary outcome parameter will be the effects on markers of endometriosis in peritoneal fluid and bone mineral density. The tertiary outcome parameters will be the assessment of the impact of our compound on inflammation markers, on cycling and on liver function.",

The therapies include the controversial ribavirin for treatment or humanized RSV monoclonal antibodies (Synagis) for prevention. The cost per season for Synagis prophylaxis is about US$ 5,000. In the absence of an effective vaccine, RSV remains a serious health threat and effort must be mounted to find effective and more economical therapies. An innovative approach of treating RSV infection with ethnobotanical (EB) preparations was identified in Phase I of this project and this concept has the potential of reducing the current treatment cost. In Phase I, the feasibility of the concept was proved by the significant in vitro and in vivo anti-RSV activity, which was better or comparable to ribavirin. This approach of using EB preparations with historical use as a treatment to target diseases was developed in enough detail to provide a basis for further development of active ingredients as anti-RSV agents. In Phase II, the active compounds in these EB fractions will be chemically purified, characterized and developed to the level of readiness required to launch clinical evaluation of these compounds as therapeutic agents against RSV infections.",

Incorporation of tungsten and weaker/ductile metals into the FM macrostructure will allowtungsten to be an effect replacement for depleted uranium.  There is a strong move to replace depleted uranium with tungsten alloys for environmental reasons.  However, tungsten alloys penetration performance does not compare to the adiabatic shearmechanisms that lead to self-sharpening of depleted uranium.  Tungsten itself is inherently resistant to adiabatic shearing therefore exhibiting mushrooming effects upon impact.  Newly developed tungsten FM composites exhibit localized, unstable shearfailure and self-sharpening properties during penetration.  The FM laminate structure allows shearing mechanisms to be built into the tungsten-based composite by combining tungsten alloy materials with weaker but structurally sound interface materials suchas tungsten carbide, tungsten carbide cobalt, tungsten nickel iron alloy and high strength steel.  Similar to traditional composites, FM composites may vary in orientation further allowing ACM to promote composites deformation mechanisms for enhanced depthpenetration.  The development of metal-based composites lends itself to commercial applications within the mining and drilling industry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         65264     Many existing and virtually all new construction installations of commercial and residential HVAC duct systems are outside of the conditional building space, and are often outside the building envelope altogether (e.g. rooftop), wasting an enormous amount of energy.  Improving insulation values from conventional R-4 per inch to R-10 to R-12 per inch performance can eliminate more than 50% of the thermal losses.  However, past approaches have focused on sealing leaks and improving mechanicals (fan/blower and damper design) because very high R-value insulation (R-12/inch) has not been commercially available.  In Phase I, flexible aerogel blanket super-insulation materials (R-12/inch) were developed that exhibit R values of 10-14 per inch based on infrared radiation (IR) opacified silica aerogel matrices.  The most promising candidate insulation materials from a cost/thermal performance viewpoint were advanced from laboratory scale (6x 6 x 1/4 coupons) to small pilot scale (90 square feet per 6 hours) utilizing formulation chemistry, mechanical gel handling methods, gel strengthening and aging methods, low-cost water repellency treatments, and rapid supercritical fluid extraction techniques.  Thermal imaging of a prototype duct-wrap insulation product showed excellent performance for both conventional cooling and heating temperature environments.  In Phase II, low-cost aerogel formulations based on sodium silicate will be improved for density, thermal performance, and mechanical properties and scaled-up to large pilot scale (1000 square feet per 6 hours).  Encapsulation methods and strategies for integrating the new aerogel blanket super-insulation into existing duct manufacturing will be tested.              Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Aerogel materials are the best solid thermal insulators known.  The flexible blanket composites should have application to aerospace, technical, clothing, appliance and commercial/residential HVAC insulation markets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Innovation in key technology areas will provide the dramatic advances needed for small- to mid-sized space-based flywheel energy storage systems. Our vision for this work is based on our understanding of high-speed machinery and our background in similarly sized flywheel systems. Based on this experience, we have focused this SBIR program on two areas: the main bearing system and the motor-generator (M-G). A reliable main bearing system is key to the success of any flywheel system. The magnetic-bearing-based system we propose is simple yet robust with high reliability. Its unique combination of passive and actively controlled elements will become the standard against which future designs are judged. The M-G directly impacts the function and capability of the magnetic bearings. We propose a device that features a rotor with very low losses and very high efficiency. Work in Phase I will prove several key aspects of the main bearing system, followed by full development of the bearings and M-G in Phase II. Because we have invested considerable effort in the preliminary design and analysis of these two elements, we are confident that the proposed technology developments will solve the most challenging aspects of flywheel energy storage systems for spacecraft.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limb-shortening deformities and bone segmental defects remain among the most difficult challenges faced by patients and orthopaedists. Traditional techniques to correct these problems rely primarily on transverse pins or wires, which are subject to pain, scars, contractions, and risk of infection. The Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of a new method for bone lengthening/transport, based on distraction osteogenesis, and using intramedullary rod fixation and a single, longitudinal traction cable actuator. The specific aim of the work is develop a completely implantable actuator to drive cable motion, thus eliminating all percutaneous penetration of wires, minimizing patient intervention, and making the need for rod exchange unlikely. In Phase I, six engineering prototype actuators were designed, built and successfully bench-tested with varying distraction forces to 1,200 N. In Phase II, the final-form distraction actuator -high-powered, self-contained and remotely controlled - will be developed, tested and combined with a largely existing suite of intramedullary nails and associated implant hardware. The successful Phase II development of a capable, cost-effective actuator, occupying a volume of 160 cc or less and weighing 200 g or less, will set the stage for the Phase III commercial development of a fully implantable bone lengthening and transport system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Description (provided by applicant): The goal of this Phase II project is to demonstrate the prototype of a fully implantable rotary ventricular assist device (VAD). This pump utilizes the advanced three-dimensional magnetic suspension for the rotor demonstrated during Phase I. This bearing system requires neither position sensors nor active feedback electronics, resulting in the simplest 3-0 magnetic bearing available for blood pumps. The bearing coils form part of a tuned inductance-capacitance-resistance (LCR) circuit. A sine wave generator powers the coil. Motion of the rotor varies the inductance and therefore tuning of the circuit such that changes in electrical current flow always occur to oppose the direction of motion. Control of the rotor position is inherent in the bearing construction and Eamshaw?s Law is satisfied. Phase I demonstrated that this bearing construct can be dynamically stable, low in power consumption, and adequately stiff to handle externally applied shock and vibration loads. During Phase II, the program will advance to design and develop a prototype implantable rotary VAD and electronics package and perform in-vivo tests and in-vitro endurance tests. Successful completion will lead directly to a Phase Ill effort and ultimately FDA approval for clinical trials.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Heart disease remains the leading cause of death and disability in the United States.  Of the 600,000 Americans who die each year due to heart-related problems, about 30,000 to 60,000 could probably be saved with heart transplants.  However, the shortage of donor hearts precludes this, and has stimulated the development of many mechanical heart assist and replacement devices. Should mechanical assist pumps prove sufficiently safe and reliable, the potential use to improve the quality of life for cardiac-impaired patients dramatically expands the market.",

The Integrated ToxicityAssessment System (ITAS) addresses the need for integration of existing predictive methodologies and data sources in a comprehensive, open architecture, artificial intelligence based system. In Phase II of this project, IAC will fully develop threefundamental components of ITAS: software integration platform, relational database of chemical and toxicological data related to acute toxicity, and computational module for evaluation of acute toxicity. Integration of these components (including suitablecomputational chemistry modules) will provide a demonstration of ITAS concept.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In Phase I IAC, teamed with Pratt & Whitney and Luppold & Associates, developed and demonstrated a hybrid modeling approach to enhance diagnostics and prognostics performance on F-117 engines. The hybrid model fuses a physics-based model developed by Pratt & Whitney called STORM with an empirical model that uses neural networks to monitor and quantify unmodeled and/or mismodeled engine phenomena that corrupt STORM?s diagnostic outputs. The resulting hybrid model is called the enhanced STORM or eSTORM. In Phase I eSTORM was demonstrated to work extremely well for limited conditions when processing simulated engine data. In Phase II IAC proposes to develop a standalone system for real time implementation of a full F-117 engine eSTORM. The system will cover the full C-17 flight envelope. The system will include interfaces to accept data from the C-17 aircraft bus and will be capable of on-wing operation. The system will be demonstrated using real F-117 inputs running in a test bench environment. Though developed explicitly for an F-117 application, the hybrid modeling concept developed on this Phase II is generic and can be used for eSTORM development on all Pratt & Whitney military and commercial engines.",

To accomplish this objective we propose to adapt the dual-frequency, self-calibrating radiometer developed in Phase I for use with 32 microwave receive antennas, include means for measuring skin temperatures, and to design and fabricate multi-layer thin and flexible conformal array antennas that may be used not only for diagnostic tissue temperature measurements, but also for monitoring and controlling existing microwave and ultrasound hyperthermia treatment devices. Application that are expected to benefit from this critical enabling technology range from the detection of subsurface inflammations and primary breast cancer, to rapid monitoring of the efficacy of cancer treatments and anti-inflammatory therapies, to monitoring and feedback control of heat therapy to large areas of skin such as is required for hyperthermia treatment of chestwall recurrence of breast cancer and plaque psoriasis lesions.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Potential commercial applications of the conformal radiometer array include devices for monitoring and controlling of superficial hyperthermiua therapies for cancer and psoriasis, for detection and monitoring of sub-surface inflammation and cancer, and for monitoring the efficacy of anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and blood perfusion enhancing therapies.",

Validated DoD needs for real-time monitoring of ionospheric weather are not being met by current remote sensing techniques. Our proposal supportsdevelopment of an ionospheric imaging instrument capable of providing real-time information on a global basis about ionospheric irregularities to improve tactical operational responses supporting surveillance, navigation, communication, missile defense,and precision geolocation. This SBIR effort focuses on reducing the instrument's cost, mass, and volume to facilitate integration as a secondary payload on geosynchronous satellite platforms. Future deployments aboard these platforms will enable real-timeglobal monitoring of ionospheric disturbances affecting both DoD and Civil Sector systems.BENEFITS: A successful effort will lead to production of multiple ionospheric imaging instrument as part of a global multi-platform geosynchronous real-time imagingsystem for monitoring structures and tracking irregularities within the earth's ionosphere. The system will provide real-time information to systems affected by ionospheric disturbances leading to improved surveillance, navigation, communication, missiledefense, and precision geolocation.

The use of a 76.5 GHz FM-CWradar seeker for an anti-armor weapon has been studied because ithas the potential for significantly lower cost than other typesof radar.  This is based on the premise that the midcourseguidance of the dispensing missile and the weapon can initiatethe seeker within a 650 meters cross range at 1 km range to thetarget.  The FM-CW radar satisfies the signal-to-noiserequirement to detect a 10 m target at 1 km range with a 4.25\"antenna that fits in a 5\" weapon.  The FM-CW waveforms have beendeveloped and tested at STS that provide range resolution from1.5 meter for search to 0.3 meter (1 foot) for acquisition,verification, and potentially target identification.  A directdigital synthesizer has been developed and tested that generatesthe FM-CW waveform with excellent stability and almost perfectlinearity.  A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processor implementedin a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) has demonstrated rangeresolution of one foot.  If the speed of the weapon approachessupersonic, it moves one foot during the time for the FFT toprocess the data for one-foot resolution.  This would smear theimage of the target.  This smearing can be avoided by additionalprocessing in the DSP, so the one-foot resolution can bemaintained even if the weapon has high",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Phase II SBIR involves the testing of a minimally invasive glucose sensor in vivo. Diabetes is an increasingly common  lifelong disease and is associated with many complications. It is responsible for an estimated 10-15 percent of all health care expenditures. Effective treatment has been shown to prevent or delay many of the associated complications. The most common current treatments include diet, exercise, and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). An improvement to the current method would enable and encourage patients to monitor their glucose levels more closely and thus improve the general health and quality of life of the diabetic population.                                                                        \r                                                                                     \r  The technology is based on a small optical sensor implant that is fluorescent      \r  and detectable through the skin.

The performance of the sensor      \r  will be studied in vivo to demonstrate that the sensor correlates with blood       \r  glucose and follows glucose changes in tolerance tests. In vivo testing will be    \r  performed to determine the recalibration interval, the reproducibility, and the    \r  accuracy of the sensor. The lifetime and biocompatibility of the sensor will       \r  also be determined.",

In Phase II, several aircraft component types subjected to different corrosion types will beinvestigated in detail. Based on the computed risks and maintenance event costs, an optimal-cost maintenance strategy for aging components can be determined.

While the need for sophisticated craniofacial imaging in the dentomaxillofacial field has existed for many years, due to cost and space restraints, practitioners have chiefly had to rely on 2D X-ray Systems or outsourcing their patients to facilities with conventional CT scanners. DentoCAT(TM) will offer practitioners an affordable and compact product that will generate CT scans featuring high contrast- and spatial resolution at a relatively low radiation dose.   Initially, DentoCAT(TM) will be targeted for dental implantology: preoperative implant planning and postoperative assessment of failed implants. It is anticipated that DentoCAT(TM) will also prove valuable in the detection of TMJ disorders, facial fractures, lesions and diseases of soft tissue in the head and neck, including tumors, and in reconstructive facial surgery.   We have demonstrated the feasibility of the design by meeting performance Milestones set in Phase I. In Phase II we will develop Alpha and Beta clinical prototypes of the device and test the Alpha prototype in a clinical setting. In Phase Ill, DentoCAT(TM)will be commercialized.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: DentoCAT(TM) will be marketed to small, midsize and large dentomaxillofacial facilities as well as by specialized oral radiology facilities, which are expected to grow in number after their recent approval as a dental specialty. Once DentoCAT(TM) is established as an imaging tool in the dentomaxillofacial marker, Xoran plans to introduce its compact CT scanner \"MiniCAT(TM)\" to the medical market for use in emergency medicine, ICUs, neurology practices, plastic surgery, and other medical specialties.",

Additionally, the data acquisition and recorder system contains a flexible sensor interface to accommodate the different gain, offset, and filtering requirements of accelerometers and other sensors if desired. Such a system could be used to characterize missile and sub-munitions shock and pyrotechnic shock environments during flight tests and be stored in a database for reference in future design and redesign activities. Such data would eliminate the trial and error associated with designing to an assumed pyrotechnic shock load and thus decrease the cost associated with those activities. Additionally, such a device could be used in a variety of applications requiring embedded autonomous acquisition and storage of sensor data during high-g, short duration events. The MDARM will provide embedded instrumentation technology immediately applicable to programs requiring non-volatile data  acquisitionand recording of event data.",

In Phase I of this effort, Eclipse Energy Systems, Inc. has demonstrated both reflective and transparent all-solid-state electrochromic membranes (EMs) built on 100cm2 flexible PET films. The reflective EMs demonstrated acceptable performance after cyclic potentiostatic tests in vacuum. The Phase II program concentrates on the development of 100cm2 VEMs built on 7 to 10 micron polymer films that can achieve a reflectance/transmittance modulation ranging from 10 to 75 %. Scale-up to fabrication of reflective EMs having 900cm2 (1? x 1?) active area will be also demonstrated in the Phase II program. EMs will be subjected to cyclic potentiostatic tests in vacuum as well as long-term exposure to ultraviolet radiation in order to demonstrate feasibility of use in orbit-to-space missions.",

Restrictions on payload weight and volume limit the usefulness of many thermal control system technologies. To address this problem, Eclipse Energy Systems, Inc. (EES) has suggested the application of electrochromic variable emittance devices (VEDs) to control the rate of energy dissipation by thermal emission from the satellite surface. During Phase I EES has demonstrated the feasibility of fabricating all-solid-state inorganic electrochromic VEDs built on high resistance silicon wafers. This VED is advantageous, because the silicon serves as a thermal shock resistant infrared window that can protect the electrochromic layers against the harsh space environment. The Phase II program will be directed toward the development of VEDs with 44cm2 active area that can achieve a tunable emittance modulation range from 0.2 to 0.6. VEDs will be subjected to different reliability tests to demonstrate feasibility of use in low, middle-earth, and geosynchronous orbit environments. The electrochromic technology under development by EES holds promise as an alternate for the ST5 mission should any of the scheduled participants fail in the preliminary test protocols.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Advances in rotor and fan blade design have produced compressors that generate greater compression ratios with higher efficiencies using fewer stages. A direct result of designing more compact compressors with higher pressure ratios is a more adverse pressure gradient which causes flow separation on the endwalls of both the rotor and stator passageways. Consequently, the performance potential of the compressor is not reached. Technology in Blacksburg is proposing the use of engine casing and hub flow control in the stator blade rows to increase stator performance and efficiency while simultaneously reducing the length and thus overall weight of the engine. Flow control is achieved with miniature ejector pumps, integrally machined into the hub and casing. Ejector pumps provide a simple and efficient way of simultaneously producing suction and a high momentum jet for flow control. Low momentum fluid in boundary layer of the endwalls is removed with suction. The fluid is then re-energized by the ejector pump and injected into the flow as a high momentum jet flowing tangent to the endwall. In this way, the boundary layer along the wall is provided with the energy necessary to remain attached in an adverse pressure gradient.",

In the Phase I SBIR Techsburg demonstrated the capability of an innovative flow control technique designed to improve the LP turbine performance leading to a reduction in costs. Flow control was achieved with ejector pumps machined into the blade surface to provide a simple and efficient way of producing blowing and suction. High-pressure supply air from the compressor is injected into the flow as a high momentum jet providing a boundary layer that is resistant to separation, while low momentum fluid in the boundary layer is removed with suction upstream and combined with the supply air to enhance the jet. CFD and experimental data predicted a 72% increase in loss coefficient for a single blade row. Techsburg is proposing a comprehensive Phase II project to perform an in-depth computational optimization, detailed low-speed testing and high-speed cascade testing. The computational effort will focus on optimizing the flow control variables and blade shape for an LP turbine blade to eliminate separation and design a more highly loaded blade. The low-speed testing will validate the CFD work on the most promising blade candidates and subsonic cascade tests at engine Mach conditions will be performed to verify the results in a more realistic test environment.",

If duplicated in autonomous flying weapons, these capabilities could greatly enhance their effectiveness. We propose a continuing collaborative effortbetween an insect neurobiologist and VLSI technologist to develop motion processing theory and technology based on insect vision. This effort will apply new findings from insect neurobiology, including work accomplished in Phase I, to the correlationalmodel of the elementary motion detector (EMD), which appears to be the basis for all higher-level visual motion processing in the insect visual system. These new findings show that adaptation of contrast sensitivity plays a crucial role in extending thedynamic range of motion estimation and conferring `velocity constancy,' a response invariance with respect to non-motion-related parameters. New models have been proposed which incorporate adaptation in the EMD, and analog circuit approaches have beendeveloped for the required functions. In this work, we undertake modeling of the adaptive EMD in analog VLSI. We expect the product to be a motion-sensing front end suitable for use in higher-level motion processing, including computation of optical flowand visual detection of small moving targets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         New developments in neuromorphic concepts permit massively parallel signal processing co-located with the cryogenic focal plane detector array. The Wave Process is a low-contrast moving point target detection algorithm that reduces the data rate todownstream sensor processing, while providing data with a high density of target information. It is efficiently implemented in compact analog VLSI circuits, resulting in small, low-power, low-cost sensors with improved mission performance.In Phase I we showed that the Wave Process can better detect low contrast targets when augmented with Sampled-Time Elementary Motion Detection for isolated noise removal, a positive-feedback gain feature that boosts the target signal, and a shape-findingfunction for pulling very dim targets out of the noise.In Phase II, Tanner Research will integrate these extensions, the Adaptive Speed feature (developed on a parallel AFRL/MN contract), and additional concepts (e.g., Optical Flow), into an Advanced Wave Process. We will demonstrate the improved missionperformance with high-fidelity simulations and validated imagery data sets representing scenarios relevant to AFRL. We will optionally apply these developments to the specific requirements of identified DoD missions and systems (e.g., UAV, cruise missiledetection, Air Superiority Missile, etc.).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The predominant mode of HIV transmission worldwide is via heterosexual contact, with the cervicovaginal mucosa serving  as the main site of viral entry in women. Realizing that the vaginal mucosa is     \r  colonized with large numbers of non-pathogenic lactobacilli, we propose an         \r  innovative approach toward blocking transmission of HIV that involves              \r  genetically modifying clinical isolates of lactobacillus to express proteins       \r  that bind and inactivate HIV prior to transmission to host tissues. We have        \r  been able to demonstrate that vaginal lactobacilli can be engineered to secrete    \r  a truncated form of the CD4 molecule (containing domains 1-2) that is capable      \r  of binding to the HIV virus and reducing the infectious titer in vitro. In so      \r  doing, we have provided the first demonstration of the expression of a complex     \r  disulfide-bonded, biologically active mammalian protein in lactobacillus. We       \r  now intend to transition this program into its early development phases to         \r  enable future clinical testing. Specifically, we propose the following aims: 1)    \r  express several other HIV binding proteins in L. jensenii and from efficacy        \r  data, select the optimal protein to carry forward; 2) integrate the ligand         \r  expression constructs into the chromosome of L. jensenii, using either selected    \r  inducible (e.g. alkaline shock) or strong, constitutive promoters (e.g. PcbsA)     \r  to drive expression from a single copy; and 3) develop pilot scale                 \r  manufacturing process, including formulation, of these engineered lactobacilli.    \r  The successful completion of these proposed Phase II studies will position us for entry into clinical trials, where this novel ViroShield approach will meet     \r  its most rigorous evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Aircraft icing is a severe aviation weather hazard as formation of ice on aircraft surfaces leads to degradation in aerodynamic performance. Today, there are limited ice detection systems available that warn pilots of icing, used primarily by the military and airlines due to their high acquisition and certification costs. Innovative Dynamics Inc. will address these issues by developing a low cost windshield infrared (IR) ice detector for the GA fleet. Existing windshield ice detectors consist of a dash mounted red light that is only visible to the flight crew at night when light is reflected from ice accretion on the pilots windshield. The proposed ice detector will operate day and night providing icing conditions information, Outside Air Temperature as well as direct measurement of accumulated ice on the windshield. During Phase I, we will develop a prototype IR ice detector and demonstrate performance in an icing tunnel. During Phase II, we will team with a leading GA manufacturer to develop a flight worthy ice detector for application to windshields of popular commercial Business Jet.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose a new broadband electromagnetic (EM) sensor, called GEM-5 (Figure 1), to measure the electrical conductivity of the first 5-10 m of Martian in-situ geology. The depth of exploration may increase with a higher transmitter power. While the sensor can be used for exploring other planets and moons, this proposal is directed specifically to a small rover such as the 1997 Sojourner to Mars. The proposed sensor will weigh less than 500 g, and its overall power consumption would be insignificant owing to its low duty cycle, assuming a slow rover speed. The GEM-5 sensing element is new and will be designed to be operated on a small rover. The proposed GEM-5 is designed to be a vertical EM gradiometer. The innovative antenna design calls for a very compact packaging and high spatial resolution for conductivity mapping. To lower the development cost and engineering risk, however, the data processing console will be largely based on its predecessors, GEM-2 and GEM-3, which have been highly successful for commercial geophysical surveys.Referring to desired technologies listed under this NASA SBIR topic: Instruments for Conducting In Situ Scientific Measurements, the proposed sensor can contribute to:+ In situ characterization of planetary subsurface regions+ Subsurface mineralogical compositions of soils, ices, sedimentary rocks, and minerals;+ Geological and environmental understanding, and;+ Electromagnetic and magnetic properties of shallow subsurface.The sensor will have the following specifications suitable for a rover deployment:+ Light (<500 gm), robust, and easy to deploy;+ Multifrequency data -- to determine layered structures such as permafrost and ice layers;+ Low data rate due to intermittent operation for a slow-moving rover; and+ Low power consumption (<1 watt-hour).",
