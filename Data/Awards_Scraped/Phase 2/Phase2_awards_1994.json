        "abstract": "Abstract         Ontogenic neural networks, those which automatically discover their topology during synthesis, offer substantial advantages over traditional machine learning techniques. They also have the potential to offer many benefits in several areas of avionics research. Among potential application areas is the ability to predict or forecast the behavior of a seemingly random or chaotic system. This proposal presents an existing ontogenic neural network paradigm - polynomial networks - and discusses both substantial enhancements to its learning algorithm and the development of an evolutionary modeling environment. This will be achieved by implementing system modeling strategies in a production-rule environment using the CLIPS expert system tool. This proposal also discusses a feasibility demonstration for a specific avionics application to clearly demonstrate the utility of the ontogenic paradigm. During Phase I, AbTech will design major enhancements to the existing ontogenic neural network paradigm, implement and deliver a substantial subset of these enhancements, and demonstrate the results of applying the resulting Phase I learning system to a well-defined avionics application. During Phase II, AbTech will implement the full Phase I design and apply the resulting modeling environment to an operational solution of the chaotic avionics system behavior prediction application.",

Preprocessing techniques which perform a useful and computationally efficient transformation on the image will be considered. Once the image has been transformed to a more efficient format, mathematical morphology and neural networks are proposed to address the issues of edge detection, identification, sensor fusion and model generation from various types of sensor data. After models are generated from each sensor, a weighted average (based upon the accuracy and performance of each sensor) can determine a new or refined object model. The cooperative-competitive neural network will be used to identify the model as a particular class of object.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We will use an innovative neural network algorithm to perdict and control National Aero-Space Plane(NASP) unstarts at the earliest possible moment. Unstarts present a design challenge to hypersonic aircraft. An unstart occurs when the pressure at the aft end of the engine flow path reaches a critical level. This overpressure causes a \"choking\" of the air flow. The flow tends to spill around the inlet and the pressures in the flowpath become excessively high. The thrust goes to zero. These high pressures can damage the engine and if the design is not sufficiently robust, an unstart could lead to loss of the vehicle. By predicting the unstart at the earliest possible moment, the prediction algorithm will give the control algorithm enough time to prevent the unstart. A few extra milliseconds additional lead time could improve control. We will compare traditional methods of pattern recognition against a neural network approach to determine if critical time could be gained with the neural approach.

The active smart material system proposed has distinct advantages over traditional passive damping treatments and active articulated control surface techniques. This innovative smart material approach has the potential to improve aircraft performance and reduce maintenance costs significantly. The technical objectives of the proposed project include: (1) defining the functional requirements for the active smart material system, (2) assembling an integrated aeroelastic/smart material model, (3) choosing the most appropriate controller architecture, (4) and designing and analyzing controllers for active smart material systems in order to suppress unwanted buffet loads. Essentially, the goal of the Phase I effort is to determine the effectiveness, in terms of performance achieved versus added weight, of an active smart material system for buffet load suppression. The program is targeted toward buffeting problems experienced by the F/A 18, but the innovation described in the proposal has application to other operational, as well as future, high performance vertical tail aircraft.",

Based upon reported research results, it appears that the Pulse Induced Plasma Chemical Process (PPCP) could be effectively applied to jet engine test cells for the control of NOx. The process provides high efficiency NOx removal at relatively low temperature without the need for NH3 injection. PPCP can be designed for a flow-through configuration which could be installed in a test cell with minimal pressure drop. In addition, VOCs present in the exhaust stream would be destroyed and particles would be collected by this system. The primary objective of the Phases I program is to determine the technical feasibility of developing PPCP for jet engine test cells. This requires the design and testing of components that can be incorporated into a control system that will fit the specific geometric constraints of size, flow rate, and pressure drop necessary for use in the existing test cells. The Phases I effort will involve a laboratory study to evaluate several key subsystems of the proposed technique and develop data required for designing a prototype full-scale test system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The development of a simple, reliable, and easily operated system to detect and measure airborne lead (Pb) to trace levels is the subject of the Phase I effort. Lead is toxic to humans at very low levels and is ingested easily by breathing air in which elemental Pb or compounds of this element are dispersed. In firing ranges there is an opportunity for shooters and range personnel to be exposed to hazardous levels of lead and its compounds. Control of Pb levels in firing ranges typically depends on adjusting ventilation to limit Pb buildup. This control strategy depends on the ability to monitor Pb levels in the air if maximum energy efficiency in use of fans and maximum heat conservation is to be achieved. The Phase I real-time monitor for Pb levels in firing range air will provide a monitor to protect human health for those using the range and provide a continuous monitor suitable for ventilation control to assure that acceptable Pb levels can be reached and maintained. After successful demonstration of the monitoring technology for trace levels of Pb in air during Phase I, the project will proceed to development and testing of a prototype analyzer at operating firing ranges in Phase II. The results of the prototype testing will serve as the basis for a commercial lead-in-air analyzer to serve a market, expanded beyond just firing ranges, in Phase III.",

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS SPACETIME ADAPTIVE PROCESSING HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY DETAILED SIMULATION AT ASI. RECENTLY, ARRAY RADAR FLIGHT TEST DATA WAS USED TO VERIFY THE PERFORMANCE OF ADAPTIVE RADAR. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL EXTEND THE SIMULATION OF SPACE-TIME ADAPTIVE RADAR TO ANGLE TRACKING AND TO THE CANCELLATION OF SCATTERED JAMMING. ONE OBJECTIVE OF THE EFFORT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALGORITHMS FOR ANGLE MEASUREMENT IN ADAPTIVE ARRAY RADARS WHERE THE ANTENNA PATTERNS ARE ADAPTED IN RESPONSE TO CLUTTER AND JAMMING. THE PATTERN DISTORTIONS ADD ERRORS TO CONVENTIONAL ANGLE TRACKERS, SUCH AS MONOPULSE. A MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ANGLE ESTIMATOR FOR THESE SYSTEMS WILL BE SIMULATED USING MODIFIED VERSIONS OF THE EXISTING ASI PROGRAMS. THE SECOND PROGRAM OBJECTIVE IS THE DEVELOPMENT AND SIMULATION OF ADAPTIVE ARRAY ALGORITHMS FOR SUPPRESSING SCATTERED JAMMING IN ADDITION TO CLUTTER AND DIRECT JAMMING. SCATTERED JAMMING IS A POSSIBLE LIMITATION IN SYSTEMS WHERE DIRECT LINE-OF-SIGHT JAMMING IS NULLED ADAPTIVELY TO A LOW LEVEL. JAMMING SCATTERED INTO THE MAIN BEAM OF A RADAR CANNOT BE NULLED IN ANGLE. A METHOD OF CANCELLING THIS SCATTERED JAMMING IS DESCRIBED IN THE PROPOSAL. THE ANGLE TRACKING TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED DURING THE PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT CAPABILITY FOR MISSILE SEEKERS AND AIRBORNE RADARS OPERATING IN CLUTTER AND JAMMING. SCATTERED JAMMING SUPPRESSION IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR FUTURE ADAPTIVE RADARS.",

The proposed effort will result in a cost-effective method of predicting MMC response under multiaxial loading which will include the consideration of fiber-matrix debond and matrix inelasticity. However, the final model will be in a relatively simple form so that it can be readily incorporated into design and life prediction analysis software used by engine manufacturers. the technology resulting from the proposed research will be of immediate use to turbine engine manufacturers as well as airframe structure manufacturers using MMCs. But the model will provide an essential (and currently unavailable) input to design of MMC components for a wide variety of defense as well as civil applicatins.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Diamondlike multinetwork and network-crystalline atomic-scale composite coatings constitute a new class of materials with unique properties including high adhesion to virtually any substrate (including materials, crystalline and glass dielectrics, plastics), excellant thermal and diffusion barrier properties, good hardness, high elasticity and flexibility, very high thermal shock resistance, extremely low friction coefficient, controllable electrical properties, controllable refractive index, and good thermal stability especially in oxygen free environments. Films are deposited at low temperature (300-500K), and substrate size is limited only by chamber diameter (currently a 760mm diameter substrate can be coated). Coatings represent a significant advance over conventional diamondlike films in allowing the ability to tailor properties. A range of coating materials can be produced for potential use in a wide variety of applications. The requirement for protective and insulating devices for microwave and plasma equipment may fall well within the characteristics of these materials. The fundamental structure of these atomic-scale composites is comprised of two self-stabilized random networks, each stabilized chemically by additional atomic species. An example of such structures is diamond-like Nanocomposites (DLN) containing a C:H and a-Si:O networks. During Phase , diamondlike carbon, DLN and doped-DLN coatings will be prepared on a selected substrate, and performance compared with the existing data on DLN and DLC. Properties of the most promising material will then be optimized and its dielectric, ablation, temperature resistance and ionization behavior studied under simulator plasma device conditions to evaluate longevity.",

IN PARTICULAR, THE CONTAINMENT OF THE ELECTROLYTE BY AN INERT SEPARATOR MATERIAL IS A DESIGN-LIMITING ISSUE. THE TYPICAL SEPARATOR FABRICATION METHOD, INVOLVING PRESSED POWDER COMBINATIONS, LEADS TO FRAGILE COMPONENTS THAT MAY SHIFT DURING USE, ALTERING THE ELECTRICAL RESPONSE OF THE CELL. IN EXTREME CASES, THE ENTIRE CELL MAY BE SHORTED. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RIGID, POROUS SEPARATOR IS PLANNED IN THIS PROJECT IN ORDER TO ALLEVIATE THIS RELIABILITY ISSUE. ALUMINUM NITRIDE (AIN), A CANDIDATE MATERIAL FOR THE SEPARATOR COMPONENT, WILL BE FABRICATED INTO RIGID, POROUS PLATES USING AN EXISTING AQUEOUS-BASED ROLL FABRICATION METHOD AND SPECIALIZED SINTERING TECHNOLOGY. PHASE I SHOULD RESULT IN A SUITABLY POROUS, STRONG TILE THAT CAN BE IMPREGNATED WITH ELECTROLYTE AND INSERTED INTO THE BATTERY CELL AS AN INTEGRAL UNIT. TILES WITH INCREASED POROSITY WILL BE DEVELOPED, BASED ON TECHNOLOGY PREVIOUSLY USED TO MAKE TILES FOR REFRACTORY APPLICATIONS. THE TILE SEPARATOR CONCEPT IS EXPECTED TO GREATLY IMPROVE THE RELIABILITY OF THE ENTIRE CELL, AND IS ALSO EXPECTED TO IMPROVE THE COMMERCIAL VIABILITY OF THE CELL BY FACILITATING A REDUCTION IN CELL SIZE AND WEIGHT, AND BY IMPROVING THE ABILITY TO MASS MANUFACUTURE CELLS INEXPENSIVELY.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Silicon carbide promises near-term insertion in high power, high temperature, applications. The wide band-gap and consequent high breakdown field of silicon carbide theoretically allows efficient high power solid state power amplifiers. Its high thermal conductivity will permit compact devices and high power density. To date, virtually all silicon carbide-based devices have been fabricated using 6H-SiC; recent advances in bulk and epitaxial 6H-SiC crystal growth have increased its availability. However, 6H-SiC may not be the preferred polytype. The performance of high power and high frequency devices would significantly increase if 3C-SiC, the cubic form, were available. 3C-SiC has twice the electron and hole mobilities of 6H-SiC and has a slightly higher saturation electron drift velocity. In Phase I the feasibility of 3C-SiC substrate growth will be demonstrated with an innovative sublimation crucible design. The objective for Phase II is to optimize the growth of 3C-SiC substrates for device demonstrations. In Phae III, ATM and its partners will scale the crystal growth process to enable the manufacture of specific devices and to supply substrates in order to accelerate the growth of an SiC-based semiconductor industry.",

THE SUCCESS OF THESE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES IS CRITICALLY DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY TO BOTH MONITOR AND CONTROL THE PROCESSING CONDITIONS. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF POWDERED METALS AS A SOURCE MATERIAL FOR A VARIETY OF METAL FORMING PROCESSES, SUCH AS PLASMA SPRAY, SINTERING, AND HOT ISOSTATIC PRESSING. HOWEVER, A LACK OF SENSORS IS SLOWING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POWDER TECHNOLOGY. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AND FIELD TEST A METAL POWDER SMART-SENSOR WHICH CAN BE EMPLOYED IN THE HOT PARTICLE FORMING PLUME, IN THE FOLLOWING STREAM OF FORMED PARTICLES, AND AS PART OF A SIZING SYSTEM TO CHARACTERIZE COLLECTED PARTICLES. THE TECHNIQUE EMPLOYS FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED (FT-IR) SPECTROSCOPY TO DIFFERENTIATE THE SCATTERING OF VARIOUS PARTICLE SIZES. FT-IR SCATTERING (FT-IRS) SPECTROSCOPY RELIES ON THE WAVELENGTH DEPENDENCE OF LIGHT SCATTERING RATHER THAN THE ANGULAR DEPENDENCE EMPLOYED BY OTHER TECHNIQUES. IN ADDITION, FT-IR EMISSION SPECTROSCOPY IN COMBINATION WITH FT-IRS OFFERS A UNIQUE CAPABILITY FOR PARTICLE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS IN THE PLUME. BECAUSE OF THEFT-IR'S CAPABILITIES, A SINGLE SPECTROMETER WILL BE ABLE TO MONITOR PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS AND TEMPERATURES IN A PROCESS STREAM, AND ISSUE PROCESS CONTROL COMMANDS. IN PHASE I AN FT-IR INSTRUMENT FOR IN-SITU PARTICLE ANALYSIS OF THE PLUME OF A METAL POWDER FACILITY (MPF) WILL BE DEVELOPED AND FIELD TESTED. THE INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT WOULD INCLUDE COUPLING OF TWO DETECTORS FOR LONG AND SHORT WAVELENGTH MEASUREMENTS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPTICS TO COUPLE THE INSTRUMENT TO THE MPF, THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CALIBRATION SYSTEM, AND FAST DATA ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS ALGORITHMS APPLICABLE TO HIGH-RATE METAL FORMING PROCESSES.

MEASUREMENTS OF THIS TYPE ARE RELATIVELY SLOW, ARE PRONE TO INACCURACIES, AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MAINTENANCE AND SAMPLE HANDING INSTRUMENTATION. PRELIMINARY MESUREMENTS INDICATE THAT THE INFRAREDSPECTRAL EMISSIVITY OF FLY ASH PARTICLES IS CORRELATED TO RESIDUAL CARBON CONTENT. A DETAILED STUDY OF THIS CORRELATION WILL BE UNDERTAKEN IN PHASE I IN ORDER TO DEVELOP AN INFRARED EMISSIVITY-BASED MONITOR CAPABLE OF MAKING ON-LINE, IN-SITU MEASUREMENTS OF CARBON IN FLY ASH IN COALCOMBUSTION FACILITIES.

GIVEN THE RELATIVELY LOW COST, HIGH ABUNDANCE, AND RENEWABLE NATURE OF THIS RESOURCE, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT MANY ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO DEVELOP HIGHER VALUE PRODUCTS FROM LIGNIN. CARBON MATERIALS HAVE A MUCH HIGHER ADDED VALUE THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER PRODUCT WHICH CAN BE PRODUCED FROM LIGNIN. THIS PHASE I PROJECT SUGGESTS THAT AN APPROPRIATE MODIFICATION OF THE COMPOSITION OF LIGNIN-DERVIED PITCH COULD GREATLY ENHANCE ITS SUITABILITY AS A PRECURSOR MATERIAL FOR CARBON FIBERS AND OTHER CARBON MATERIALS. RELATIVELY HIGH YIELDS OF ALKYL SUBSTITUTED, OXYGEN REDUCED TARS CAN BE PRODUCED FROM LIGNIN PYROLYSIS FOLLOWED BY SECONDARY CATALYTIC TREATMENT OF TARS OVER AN ALUMINA BED. LIGNIN-MODIFYING ENZYMES CAN REDUCE, DEPOLYMERIZE, AND/OR DEMETH(OX)YLATE LIGNIN-LIKE MATERIALS. COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT THROUGH PHASE II WOULD RESULT IN A PROCESS TAILORED TOWARD THE PRODUCTION OF MESOPHASE PITCH FROM LIGNIN, AN OPTIMIZED PRODUCT SLATE, A QUANTITATIVE MODEL RELATING TAR PROPERTIES TO PROCESS CONDITIONS, AND ON-LINE FOURIER TRANSFORM-INFRARED (FT-IR) DIAGNOSTICS FOR PROCESS CONTROL.",

However, toxicity and waste disposal problems have led to the urgent need for development of an environmentally benign substitute for chromium compounds in coatings and sealants, which is the subject of this SBIR. This pa'per discusses the state-of-the-art technical approaches to the solution and suggests: (1) Grafting of metal surface with ^%surface active agent\", such as quaternary chelating agents and giianidines to passivate potenttally active corrosion sites on the metal surface. (2) Converting the metal oxide layer, which is formed as a corrosi(jn product on the metal surface, into a protective layer for the surface beneath. The paper also discusses material selection criteria, formulation hypotheses, and proof of concept testing for the development of a rion- toxic and environmentally safe inhibitors to be used in chemical conversion coating of aluminum and aluminum alloy (MIL-C-5541), primer coating of metals (M1L-P-23377), and corrosion inhibiting sealing compounds (M1L-8-81733).

This project will implement a unique new analysis capability to analyze and assess a novel propulsion device that could greatly enhance applications in the hypersonic class of flight vehicles. The ODW Hy-Scram Engine is configured to use gas dynamic wave interactions to provide inlet stream primary compression(after vehicle forebody compression), bulk ignition, and rapid combustion. The major advantages over previous Scramjet engines are:1)use of the vehicle forebody for fuel injection and complete mixing(due to longer distances, lower temperatures and lower pressures than is typical in the inlet fuel injection systems of Scramjet Engines), 2)simpler and shorter inlet design due to lower Mach range through which the flow must be decelerated (typically incorporated into the vehicle forebody), and 3)shorter and simpler combustor design. The primary benefit of this approach is the reduction of the weight associated with the propulsion system for a given combustion efficiency. The secondary benefit is stabilized combustion due to the bulk ignition of the fuel and oxidizer in the stable over driving of the oblique detonation wave.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Dependability is an increasingly critical characteristic of the Navy's mission critical computer systems. These systems must be maintained in a state of readiness to support critical mission functions, and must be able to perform these functions correctly despite the presence of faults in system hardware and software components, and in the environments in which the systems operate. Automated tools are needed to assist in specifying and evaluating dependability characteristics of mission critical computer system designs, and in balancing dependability against other system attributes such a performance and cost. Phase I research will determine the feasibility of an automated system dependability assessment tool (SDAT) for assessment of mission critical computer system dependability. SDAT will consist of separate design specification, design translation, and design evaluation components. These tool components will be extendible and will be compatible with other Navy system engineering methods and tools. Quantitative dependability measures that will be produced by SDAT include mission reliability and operational availability for critical system functions. Dependability modeling capabilities provided by existing automated tools, including the START integrated reliability and performance analysis tool, as well as other reliability prediction tools sucyh as SHARPE and ARAM, will provide a starting point for the SDAT specification to be developed in Phase I.",

ABUNDANT OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN JOB OPPORTUNITY AND TRAINING INFORMATION FROM VOICE PROCESSING SYSTEMS EXISTS FOR HEARING PERSONS BUT IS NOT READILY ACCESSIBLE TO TDD USERS. EVEN WHEN ACCESSIBLE THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY RELAY SERVICE, EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT NOT ALL RELAY SERVICES ARE PREPARED OR WILLING TO SEARCH THROUGH MASSIVE DATA BASES AND MENU OPTIONS OF ON-LINE TELEPHONE INFORMATION AND TRANSCRIBE IT BACK TO THE TDD CALLER. IF DEAF PERSONS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE SAME JOB INFORMATION WITHOUT INORDINATE AND ARDUOUS TIME CONSUMPTION, THEY CAN BETTER COMPETE IN AND SERVE THE WORKPLACE. THIS EFFORT INCLUDES: (1) USING EXISTING VOICE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY TO IMPLEMENT TWO WAY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN VOICE PROCESSING AND TDD'S; (2) DEVELOPING A DYNAMIC JOB TRAINING AND INFORMATION LIBRARY; (3) CONDUCTING A THREE TO FOUR WEEK PILOT; AND (4) IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL CAPITAL COMMITMENTS.

The goal of this project is to develop a new open-path absorption cell suitable for in situ measurements of reactive trace species from an aircraft platform. The open-path design, in which the laser beam undergoes multiple reflections between two mirrors located on the wing and the fuselage, is preferable to more commonly used enclosed path sampling cells because reactive gases may be perturbed by sampling inlets and surfaces. This project will test a multipass cell that uses a novel astigmatic mirror system which can obtain sufficient path length (600 m) with relatively small diameter mirrors (10 cm). This cell will minimize size, weight, and aerodynamic perturbations and will make the system particularly suitable for deployment on small, unmanned aircraft being developed for stratospheric research. Phase I research would optimize the design of the mirrors, develop an automated alignment method, and evaluate the applicability of the open-path absorption system for detecting target stratospheric trace gases such as HNO3, HOCl, HCl, ClONO2, and the HO2 radical.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Degraded performance due to surface damage of aircraft windows and antennas caused by atmospheric particle effects is currently a very serious problem. Impact testing is currently underway in ground test cells such as the wind tunnels and arc facilities located at Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC). For these tests, instrumentation that can determine the velocity vectors and size distribution for a wide range of particles, including irregular crystalline particles is needed. In this proposal, we describe a probe that features a combination of spatially resolved velocity vector measurement capability of an LDV with an imaging sizing method which is not restricted to spherical particles. The resulting single probe will allow simultaneous single-particle 2-dimensional velocity and irregular particle size characterization in a diameter range of 0.1 mm to 1.0 mm, with an expected accuracy of 10%, and a velocity accuracy of better than 1%. It will have an easily adjustable probe volume dimension in order to cope with the expected different number densities and will be easily moved between facilities. In addition, the probe will feature a high spatial resolution in order to asses the spatial ditribution of the particle accurately.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this Phase I research is to implement a conservative method for transferring data across arbitrary nonoverlapping zonal interfaces in the CFD code GASP version 3.0. This task will involve a linear interpolation of primitive variables in three dimensions with a gradient weighted flux correction method aimed at maintaining global flux conservation. For applications such as complex internal flows and hypersonic vehicles where engine/airframe integration analysis is crucial, sophisticated multi-block structured grid techniques are required. These techniques must not only be flexible and easy to use, but they must also be accurate. An arbitrary zonal interface interpolation scheme with global flux conservation will provide these characteristics. The Phase II portion of this research will build on the Phase I work by considering additional state variable interpolations, nonoveralpping grid topologies, time accurate calculations with moving grids, and interpolation across zonal boundaries between a structured and unstructured mesh. At the conclusion of this work, we will deliver and demonstrate the code to the Air Force including installation, software listings, a new GASP manual, and a training class.",

IN THIS PROPOSAL WE DESCRIBE AN EFFORT AIMED AT ACCOMPLISHING THIS TASK BY EXPLOITING THE RECENT ADVANCES IN WAVELET TRANSFORMS, MULTIRESOLUTION SIGNAL AND IMAGE ANALYSIS, AND FRACTAL IMAGE PROCESSING. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS, MOTIVATED BY THE WAVELET TRANSFORM, IN OPTIMAL MULTISCALE IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, PROVIDING A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR IMAGE SEGMENTATION AND FEATURE EXTRACTION, CLUTTER REMOVAL, AND MULTISENSOR FUSION THAT HOLD THE PROMISE OF SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH PERFORMANCE AND COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY. WE DESCRIBE HOW THIS FRAMEWORK CAN BE USED FOR TARGET DETECTION, FEATURE EXTRACTION, AND CLUTTER REJECTION BASED EITHER ON SPATIAL OR SPATIO-TEMPORAL FEATURES. WE ALSO DESCRIBE HOW THE WAVELET TRANSFORM LEADS NATURALLY TO THE IDEA OF A WAVELET NETWORK, A NONLINEAR ADAPTIVE LEARNING FRAMEWORK THAT APPEARS TO HOLD CONSIDERABLE PROMISE FOR TARGET FEATURE EXTRACTION AND CLASSIFICATION. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: RESULTS OF THIS EFFORT SHOULD LEAD TO NEW AND EFFECTIVE METHODS FOR THE DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF SPATIO-TEMPORALLY LOCALIZED PHENOMENA IN COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTS, AND FOR MOTION DETECTION AND ESTIMATION.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Continuing increases in computing capability present numerous opportunities to assist the staff of a command center as they analyze enemy operations, construct and evaluate courses of action, and monitor the execution of the selected option. Nowhere are these opportunities more critical than in the areas of national and theatre missile defense. ALPHATECH has developed the most advanced and mature fixed-algorithm decision aid for missile defense, the Look-Ahead Battle Planner, which evaluates the expected outcome of an engagement given certain data about threat and friendly forces. It is based on complex optimization algorithms which schedule interceptor missions against the expected target set. Recent advances in neural computing techniques offer the potential to augment this capability with faster, adaptive techniques which can be rapidly retrained as threat characteristics change. This proposal describes a program to implement and test a neural network which may provide order-of-magnitude increases in responsiveness. Our approach is to generate training and test data sets using the Look-Ahead Battle Planner, to develop and implement a neural network to assess potential battle outcomes given coarse information about threat and friendly forces, and to compare the performance and computational requirements of the neural approach with the existing aid.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Nucleic acid hybridization reactions are at the heart of a number of powerful assays used in molecular biology research and increasingly in diagnostic applications. Hybridization reactions typically require long incubation times, i. e. overnight. Recent work has demonstrated that a ribonucleoprotein and certain cationic detergents can increase hybridization rates several thousand fold such that the reaction will effectively go to completion in a few minutes. The overall goal is to use this technology to develop high-speed nucleic acid hybridization procedures for use in solution and solid phase assays such as Southern blotting. To demonstrate feasibility, we will couple this high-speed hybridization technology to a new streamlined method developed at Ambion for ribonuclease protection assays. We will use nucleic acid probes immobilized to beads to determine optimum conditions for high-speed hybridization. The results from these experiments will then be applied to the development of protocols for high-speed Southern and Northern hybridization procedures. The successful completion of this project will have major impact, both on the research and especially the diagnostic applications of nucleic acid hybridization assays.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The U.S. Navy has identified a need for development of an innovative data compression technique to facilitate distribution of video and animated environmental products over low bandwidth communication channels. To address this need, American Research Corporation of Virginia (ARCOVA) proposes the development of an intelligent data compression interface for transmission of video imagery, graphics and multi-dimensional array fields to environmental computer systems at shore sites and ships. The program technical objectives include identification of environmental database specifications, selection of an optimal neural network paradigm, training and testing of the neural network paradigm selected, and design of a user interface. Successful completion of these objectives will result in an automated data reduction system capable of achieving maximal compression with minimal loss. The significance of this effort is the innovative use of neural networks for compression and distribution of video and animated data for use on newly developed environmental computer equipment and systems. Since neural networks have been shown to be faster and more accurate than traditional data compression techniques in similar applications, ARCOVA will demonstrate a proof-of-concept system for video image compression that is superior to current methods.",

This new type of antenna array has the potential to impact the capabilities and performance of new missiles in multiple areas. - Cost Reduction - The seeker antenna system proposed is predicted to be considerably simpler to manufacture thereby reducing the cost. - This conformal array approach removes the requirement for a costly radome assemblv. This will reduce boresight errors and power loss resulting from the radome and makes the area at the nose of the missile available for other complementary sensors. - The antenna system and the proposed associated feeds and operating system will preclude the need for phase shifters and other expensive phased array technology. - Gimballed antennas are not required. - The proposed antenna system will have a higher reliability with fewer parts and no moving parts. - Because of the absence of the radome requirement, the system is compatible with all seeker frequencies through 94 GHZ. - No requirement for a rolling airframe to unmask monopulse blind areas. The array antenna achieves the electronic equivalent to a rolling monopulse by using banks of 8 elements, switched electronically, to achieve 2 sets of orthogonal views 45 degrees apart.",

Advances in recombinant DNA and genetic technologies have made Beta-thalassemia the primary genetic disease of multiple mutations. Molecular basis is being characterized for more than 90% of all the defective genes and is leading to new methods for Beta-thalassemia diagnosis. However, current molecular technologies are only available in specialized research laboratories, and very few patients can actually receive benefits form them. These techniques cannot be utilized and applied to clinical diagnosis, carrier detection and genetic counselling. We will conduct research and study the molecular technologies of direct analysis of Beta-globin gene lesions and quantitation of erythroid cell mRNA, combined with micro-DNA sampling (MDS) from dried blood method to develop simple and rapid molecular diagnostic kits which will provide a new method for the diagnosis of Beta- thalassemia syndrome, for the clinical laboratories. Our new diagnostic kits will play an important role in providing clear understanding of the carrier rates of the mutant Beta-globin alleles. These understandings will improve the current various programs in the U. S. and other countries to monitor the birth rate of affected children.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE STRENGTHENING OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTING (HTS)COMPOSITE WIRES WITH OXIDE DISPERSION STRENGTHENED (ODS) SILVER IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS PROJECT. STATE-OF-THE-ART HTS COMPOSITE WIRES CONSIST OF CERAMIC SUPERCONDUCTOR FILAMENTS ENCASED IN A SILVER (AG) SHEATH. FOR REASONS OF CHEMICAL COMPATIBILITY AND OXYGEN PERMEABILITY, SILVER IS THE ONLY MATERIAL THAT CAN BE USED TO SHEATH THE HTS. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT METHOD OF MANUFACTURE WEAKENS THE AG SHEATH, RESULTING IN REDUCED HTS COMPOSITE STRENGTHS. THE LOW STRENGTHS ARE A MAJOR OBSTACLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HTS WIRES FOR APPLICATIONS REQUIRING HIGH STRENGTH SUCH AS POWER TRANSMISSION CABLES, SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETIC ENERGY STORAGE (SMES), CURRENT LIMITERS, AND MOTORS. THE ONLY KNOWN METHOD OF INCREASING THE STRENGTH OF SHEATH, WHILE MAINTAINING THE CHEMICAL COMPATIBILITY AND OXYGEN PERMEABILITY OF AG IS ODS. ODS IS CURRENTLY USED TO STRENGTHEN AG FOR RELATIVELY LOW-TEMPERATURE APPLICAATIONS. HOWEVER, HIGH TEMPERATURES ARE USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF HTS COMPOSITE WIRES, AND LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE HIGH TEMPERATURE CHARACTERISTICS OF ODS-AG MATERIALS. PHASE I WILL EVALUATE NOVEL ODS-AG MATERIALS, IN THE CONTEXT OF HTS COMPOSITES PROCESSING. TWO SYNTHESIS ROUTES TO FORM ODS-AG WILL BE EVALUATED IN PHASE I: INTERNAL OXIDATION OF A METALLIC ALLOY PRECURSOR AND POWER METALLURGY. AN ASSESSMENT OF THE FORMABILITY AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE ODS-AG MATERIALS PRODUCED BY EACH ROUTE WILL BE MADE. MATERIALS PRODUCED USING THE TWO SYNTHESIS ROUTES WILL BE USED IN STATISTICALLY DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS, BASED ON PROCESS CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE USED TO FABRICATE HTS COMPOSITES. A QUATITATIVE EXPRESSION OF THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE NOVEL ODS-AG MATERIALS AS A FUNCTION OF THE PROCESS PARAMETERS (TEMPERATURE, OXYGEN ACTIVITY, TIME, AND STRAIN) WILL BE ACHIEVED. PHASE II WILL BE DIRECTED TO THE FABRICATION AND TESTING OF HTS COMPOSITES USING THE OPTIMUM SHEATHING MATERIALS.",

This exploratory effort will produce a methodology for estimating each of the logistics cost drivers associated with each phase of the life cycle that can be tailored to the requirements of an acquisition program. Total life cycle cost will be derived as a compilation of life cycle phase costs for concept exploration and definition; demonstration and validation; engineering and manufacturing development; production and deployment; operation and support; and including deactivation and disposal or reclamation. The effort will utilize cost estimating relationship (CER) development techniques and parametric modeling for application to each of the ten logistics disciplines identifying a common set of parameters for different levels of system/equipment technology.",

The feasibility of using GaN for short wavelength (up to 365 nm) OEIC's will be established in Phase I via the demonstration of a channel waveguide based phase shifter. The Al(sub x)GA(sub 1-x)N material system with its transparency from 365 nm to 12 microns, tunable refractive index (with alloy composition) and a high electro-optic coefficient is an excellent choice for fabricating short wavelength waveguide devices. It also has been deposited in excellent single crystal form over substrates such as sapphire, GaAs and silicon which makes possible integration of control and driver electronics along with the guided wave components. With our demonstration of GaN planar waveguides and measurement of the material electro-optic coefficient we are in a good position to demonstrate a channel waveguide based phase shifter in Phase I. This will be followed by the fabrication of an active OEIC component such as a modulator in the Phase II effort.",

The innovative aspect of the proposed device is the use of an integrated optics device chip to enable coupling of the dispersed laser wavelengths into separate electro-optic modulators which encode each of the carrier wavelengths with a different signal. This device could be used in data communication systems to achieve the volume of data flow required by data systems that have an integrated form where video, voice, and data are simultaneously distributed and processed. The objective of the Phase I program is to design the various components of the wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical modulator, and to write specifications detailing critical component parameters, fabrication procedures and/or sources for procurement of components. Phase I experimental studies will provide data for the design studies through measurements of the spatial characteristics of both the light beam of the specified laser source and the guided light beam of the integrated optic waveguide structure. This Phase I effort will provide the design specifications required to fabricate and evaluate a prototype WDM optical modulator in the Phase II program.",

THE PREMISE OF THIS EFFORT IS THAT \"SEEING IS BELIEVING\". RESEARCHERS ARE MAKING RADIATION VISIBLE BY PUTTING A BUBBLE CHAMBER IN EACH STUDENT'S POCKET. THE BUBBLE CHAMBERS ARE COMPOSED OF GEL SUSPENSIONS OF LIQUID DROPS THAT ARE SUPERHEATED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. WHEN RADIATION OF SUFFICIENT ENERGY (AND STOPPING POWER) INTERACTS WITH ATOMS WITHIN THE DROP, IT SUDDENLY VAPORIZES, PRODUCING A CLEARLY VISIBLE BUBBLE AND AN EASILY AUDIBLE \"POP\". THE RATE OF BUBBLE FORMATION INDICATES THE RADIATION FLUX, AND THE TOTAL BUBBLE PRODUCTION IS A MEASURE OF TOTAL RADIATION EXPOSURE. GAMMA, X-RAY, NEUTRON, AND BETA RADIATION CAN BE SENSED, DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR DROP MATERIAL AND THE AMBINET CONDITIONS (PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE). THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT SHIELDINGS, OF LOWER DOSE WITH DISTANCE, AND OF THE QUALITY OF RADIATION IS EASILY DEMONSTRATED. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTAL KITS FOR STUDENTS AT MIDDLE SCHOOL, HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE, AND MEDICAL SCHOOL LEVELS IS BEING RESEARCHED. PHYSICS, BIOLOGY, AND CHEMISTRY PROGRAMS HAVE A POTENTIAL INTEREST IN VARYING ASPECTS OF THE WORK.",

Three to five carbon-carbon materials will be designed and analyzed in the required packaging configuration with appropriate mechanical and thermal loads applied. Based on the analysis results, one to three of the material designs will be selected and coupon test samples will be fabricated. Mechanical, thermal and physical property measurements will be made. Based on the analysis and test results one or more of these material designs will be selected for phase II development. An agreement has been made with Honeywell Space Systems Operation (Phoenix, AZ) to work with AMT to develop a product that will use C-C material for their spacecraft applications. BF Goodrich, a fabricator of high thermal conductivity C-C material, will be the material supplier for the phase I effort.",

In the proposed effort, Applied Optronics will use newly developed aluminum, gallium, and antimony metal organic sources to grow high purity, narrow bandgap III-V materials by the MOCVD technique. These new sources have been demonstrated to reduce carbon contamination in MOCVD grown materials, and will allow Applied Optronics to grow antimony alloy, high power laser structures with improved performance in the 2 to 5 micron band compared to existing semiconductor lasers. Applied Optronics will design these devices for later integration into a MOPA device. Objectives include design of a high power GaInAsSb/AlGaAsSb laser structure, growth by MOCVD using trimethylamine alane (TiPSb), development of a suitable device fabrication process including etching, coating and metallization for GaInAsSb/AlGaAsSb laser and MOPA structures, and design of a MOPA device in the antimony alloy material system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Mice lacking a functional c-src gene develop osteopetrosis due to a defect in bone resorption by osteoclasts (1). This evidence implicates the role of Src in osteoclast resorption activity. We aim to develop a drug that blocks the action of Src protein kinase as a potential treatment of osteoporosis. To do this, we are targeting a domain of the Src protein kinase termed SH2 (src homology 2). SH2 domains are found on a number of intracellular proteins and function as receptors for tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptides. Our Phase I goal is to identify peptides that tightly bind to the Src SH2 domain using a technique termed \"phage display\". A library of pentapeptides is expressed on the surface of M13 phage fused to the gene III protein, a minor M13 coat protein. Each phage displays a single peptide sequence on its surface. The phage library is mixed with immobilized SH2 domain and non-binding phage are removed by washing. Bound phage are eluted and propagated through E. coli to produce a population of phage enriched for sequences that recognize the SH2 domain. Since SH2 domains exhibit a higher affinity for tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides versus nonphosphorylated peptides, we will use several novel approaches to phosphorylate the phage-displayed peptides. The selection cycle is repeated 5-10 times then individual phage are cloned, and the encoded peptides are sequenced. Peptides derived from the selected clones will be synthesized and tested for binding to Src SH2 domain.",

We will emphasize the AF proteins including their analysis by computational modeling, to design a low-cost synthetic analog. Dr Welsh, University of Missouri, will contribute $50,000 in hardware and software for their evaluation. We will provide proof-of-concept for selected deicers, and validate their ability to meet Air Force regulation 91-15, and obtain approval from the Air Force Materials Laboratory.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Monopole and dipole antennas have been determined to radiate most efficiently when the size of the antenna is proportional to the frequency being transitted or received, ie.e, one-quarter, one-half or one wavelength. As the operating frequency is varied from that ideal frequency, nulls begin to develolp which threaten the integrity of the communication link. Experience has shown that small excusions (+/- 50% of the resonent frequency) can be achieved without degrading performance by use of matching devices. But, larger bandwidths are normally accomodated by active high impedence tuning devices and couplers. This investigation will evaluate new low impedance passive broadbanding techniques to produce low profile, high performance antennas. Several Astron innovative techniques are proposed which will significantly decrease size without effecting gain and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The goal of this project is to create tools to support the formal verification of VHDL designs. Two existing formal verification tools will be enhanced to support VHDL. The first, Spectool, will allow a class of designs, the synchronous finite-state controlled systems, to be specified and verified and then translated into VHDL. This capability will allow VHDL to be used as an interface between Spectool, which has been used to verify several large designs, and other CAD tools. The second tool, Penelope, will be enhanced to allow specification and verification of arbitrary VHDL designs. Phase I will complete the enhancement of Spectool to allow translation of verified designs into VHDL. Examples will be worked using the enhanced tool and will guide the development of the VHDL interface language to be used in the VHDL-enhanced Penelope. Penelope will be enhanced to support the core language constructs of VHDL, laying a foundation for the Phase II effort. In Phase II of the project, the VHDL- enhanced Penelope system will be completed to support all of VHDL and integrated with the Ada part of Penelope so that mixed hardware/software systems can be verified.",

AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS APPROACH IS ATLANTIC AEROSPACE ELECTRONICS CORP'S. APPLICATION OF MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES TO RADAR DETECTION, TRACKING AND FEATURE EXTRACTION FOR CLASSIFICATION. THESE TECHNIQUES OFFER IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AGAINST NONUNIFORM CLUTTER BACKGROUNDS AND HIGH FALSE ALARMS RESULTING FROM USE OF LOWERED THRESHOLDS FOR DETECTION OF REDUCED-RADAR-CROSS SECTION TARGETS. IN ADDITION, THEY ARE COMPUTATIONALLY SIMPLE AND THUS CAN HANDLE LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA AT REAL-TIME RATES IN COMPACT PROCESSOR HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATIONS. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THE PROBLEM AT HAND SINCE THE CAPABILITIES OF CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART RADAR SYSTEM COMPONENTS WILL BE EXAMINED AND TRADES MADE TO CHOOSE RADAR PARAMETERS THAT OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE. IN PARTICULAR, A HYBRID ANALOG/DIGITAL CLUTTER CANCELLATION SCHEME WILL BE EVALUATED WHICH OFFERS THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE A/D CONVERTER DYNAMIC RANGE REQUIREMENT ALLOWING USE OF FASTER SAMPLING FOR BETTER RADAR RANGE RESOLUTION AND REDUCE CLUTTER.

ANALYSES INDICATE THAT, RELATIVE TO CONVENTIONAL HEAT EXCHANGER DESIGNS, AFACTOR OF MORE THAN FIVE REDUCTION IN CORE VOLUME CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH THE ATSS APPROACH. THE PROPOSED PHASE I EFFORT INCLUDES ANALYTICALSTUDIES AND LIMITED FABRICATION AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES TO DEMONSTRATE THE APPROACH.",

These routines will be such that they run on a PC, such as a 486, and are compatible with commercial software packages, such as MATLAB, Matrix X, or Control C. A key feature of this work is the breadth of experience that the Optical Sciences Company has in both adaptive optics testing/analysis and software development. To demonstrate this fact, some data processing routines for adaptive optics have been coded into MATLAB and used to process real data. These results are presented in this proposal and serve to illustrate that the Optical Sciences Company is very far along into this area of activity, thereby ensuring that the government will obtain the best return on its investment if the Optical Sciences Company is selected.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         It is clear that the utility of tactile aids degrades even more rapidly in the presence of noise than is the case for hearing aids. This is particularly apparent in the integration of visual and tactile cues as for example in speechreading. One reason may be is because many of the cues derived from tactile inputs are quite crude, depending more on temporal properties devoid of fine spectral features, than is true even for a defective auditory channel. One consequence is that short transient noises occurring in the background give rise to tactile stimuli that are indistinguishable from those derived from transient speech waveforms. While most existing tactile aids incorporate some form of noise suppression, the improvements obtained are modest at best, particularly as regards the transient noises which are the most deleterious. The long range goal is to evolve a recently developed highly directional microphone into a format suitable for use with tactile aids in order to improve their use under noisy conditions. At present, the microphone has as a major shortcoming excessive case noise. The goal of Phase I is to determine if the design can be replicated by using small hearing aid microphone elements to obtain a small case-noise resistant package that can be conveniently worn. If successful, the design would most likely be useful for cochlear implants and hearing aids as well.",

The purpose of this proposal is to use Perseus as a demonstration platform for lightweight enviromental sensing payloads of interest to the Office of Naval Research. Two candidate payloads are discussed in this proposal (one for tropospheric research and one for operational weather reconnaissance). During Phase I, a description of the sensor/platform system, what would be measured, and why a remotely controlled platform is scientifically/fiscally superior to the present methods of making such measurements would be documented. Phase I will produce a report that identified concepts to be tested in phase II, Aurora will build the system identified in Phase I and demonstrate its predicted capabilities.",

These advances include (1) algorithms using neural networks to enhance on-line parameter estimation and continuous control reconfiguration, (2) analytically derived optimum control for the coupled nonlinear inner loop and outer loop dynamics of high-performance flight vehicles, (3) synthesis of neural networks that initialize two-point boundary-value control solutions, (4) powerful airborne computing capabilities, and (5) new sensing techniques and adaptive materials. This proposal presents a unifying conceptual design framework for integration of these capabilities into self designing flight control systems to eliminate gain switching, accommodate failures and damage, maximize maneuverability and the flight envelope, and increase the probability of successful mission completion. In Phase I Barron Associates will refine this concept, assess its feasibility, practicality, and current technology limitations, develop critical analytical and computational tools, and perform preliminary simulations. In Phase II Barron Associates will implement the self designing controller and interface it with the simulation of a representative aircraft to demonstrate its operation in realistic scenarios.",

HOWEVER, CURRENT MEMBRANE SYSTEMS HAVE CAPTURED ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE POTENTIAL MARKET, PRIMARILY BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE FROM POLYMERS THAT ARE NOT DURABLE ENOUGH FOR MANY APPLICATIONS, AND THEY DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT SELECTIVITY FOR CLEAN SEPARATIONS. PLASMA-POLYMER MEMBRANES OFFER A SOLUTION TO BOTH PROBLEMS. THESE MEMBRANES EXHIBIT EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH SELECTIVITY, AND THEY ARE SO HIGHLY CROSSLINKED THAT THEY ARE BOTH CHEMICALLY AND THERMALLY STABLE. THE GOAL OF PHASE I IS TO DEVELOP A COMPOSITE MEMBRANE CONSISTING OF A MICROPOROUS SUPPORT ON WHICH A THIN, HIGHLY SELECTIVE LAYER IS DEPOSITED--ALL FROM PLASMA POLYMERS. SUCH A MEMBRANE WOULD OVERCOME CURRENT SELECTIVITY AND DURABILITY SHORTCOMINGS OF OTHER MEMBRANES. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROCESS FOR MAKING SUCH MEMBRANES WILL PREPARE THE WAY FOR MAKING MEMBRANES DIRECTLY FROM ANY OF A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANIC OR INORGANIC, MONOMERS AND MIXTURES THEREOF, THEREBY EXTENDING THE USEFUL RANGE OF SEPARATION PROPERTIES AND OVERCOMING THE EVER-INCREASING COSTS AND THE LIMITATIONS ON MEMBRANE-SEPARATION PROPERTIES ASSOCIATED WITH USING SPECIALITY POLYMERS FOR MEMBRNE MATERIALS.",

NO TECHNOLOGY EXISTS TODAY FOR THE COST-EFFECTIVE REMOVAL OF N2 FROM NATURAL GAS AT THE WELLHEAD. IN PHASE I, THE N2 WILL BE SEPARATED FROM THE REST OF THE NATURAL GAS USING A REGENERABLE ABSORBENT. THE N2 ABSORBENTS ARE BASED ON SOLUTIONS OF TRANSITION-METAL COMPLEXES. THESE ABSORBENTS IDEALLY WILL HAVE THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: (1) RAPID ABSORPTION OF NITROGEN AT THE PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE OF THE NATURAL GAS FEED STREAM (HIGH PRESSURE AND AMBIENT TEMPERATURE), (2) RAPID DESORPTION OF NITROGEN UNDER MILD CONDITIONS (AMBIENT PRESSURE AND MODERATE TEMPERATURE), (3) EXTREMELY HIGH SELECTIVITY FOR NITROGEN OVER METHANE (AND THE OTHER NATURAL GAS COMPONENTS), AND (4) OTHER PROPERTIES THAT COMBINE TO YIELD AN ECONOMICAL PROCESS. THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF N2-BINDING COMPOUNDS AND THEIR PROPERTIES WILL BE USED TO INCREASE THE SELECTIVITY OF THE N2ABSORBENT--THE KEY SHORTCOMING OF CURRENT ABSORBENTS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Many long term wheelchair users develop back pain or spinal and pelvic deformities, which are in part due to the rounded spinal posture promoted by the sling upholstery in the standard wheelchair. Two back support systems which connect to the vertical upright frame members of a standard wheelchair with tension straps will be designed and fabricated for evaluation. The low back support system is a single support pad for use with low back wheelchairs. The full back support system is for use on wheelchairs with standard back heights. Both the low back and full back support systems reshape the contour of the sling back rest upholstery by exerting forward pressure from behind the sling upholstery. This reshapes the wheel chair user's sitting posture. The design solutions will be posturally supportive, comfortable, adjustable, lightweight, durable, affordable, aesthetically pleasing and will allow folding of the wheelchair without removal. No other backrest support systems are available which both reshape sling backrest upholstery and satisfy the above design criteria. A design and evaluation process for optimizing the specifications of both systems with regard to the pad shape, placement, foam type, and attachment to the wheelchair will be followed.",

For example, wheelchair users desire to experience outdoor trails just as much as everyone else. Existing definitions of accessibility for building access can not realistically be applied toward outdoor trails, and existing trail grading systems do not tell a wheelchair user or person with limited vision the objec- tive information needed to determine if a trail can be hiked independently, with assistance, or at all. This project will develop and test a system for measuring and then coding objective information on the degree of accessibility of outdoor trails into maps. The maps will enable people with mobility and visual limitations to make decisions about where they might try to go hiking. In the projects final implementation, a certified trail assessment coordinator will make measurements with a team of volunteers. The data will be processed using Computer Aided Design software into a map with text that will be printed and distributed through a variety of mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ENCAPSULATED RADIOACTIVE SOURCES EMITTING IONIZING RADIATION IN THE FORM OF HIGH ENERGY PHOTONS ARE WIDELY USED FOR TREATMENT OF CANCER, KNOWN AS BRACHYTHERAPY. IN THIS TREATMENT RADIOACTIVE SOURCES ARE PLACED DIRECTLY IN THE TUMOR VOLUME (INTERSTITIAL BRACHYTHERAPY) OR IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE TUMOR IN BODY CAVITIES (INTRACAVITARY IRRADIATION). RECENTLY THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF BRACHYTHERAPY SOURCES EMITTING LOWER ENERGY PHOTONS IN THE ENERGY RANGE OF 20 TO 100 KEV BECAUSE THEY OFFER ADVANTAGES OVER HIGHER ENERGY PHOTON EMITTERS IN TERMS OF EASE OF RADIATION SHIELDING WITHIN THE PATIENT AND RADIATION PROTECTION OF MEDICAL PERSONNEL. FOLLOWING THIS TREND, SM-145 SOURCES FOR BRACHYTHERAPY WERE DEVELOPED AT BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY (BNL). THESE SOURCES EMIT PHOTONS IN THE ENERGY RANGE OF 38 TO 45 KEV AND DECAY WITH A HALF LIFE OF 340 DAYS. IN ADDITION TO THE ADVANTAGES OF THE EASE OF RADIATION SHIELDING, SM-145 SOURCES EMIT PHOTONS WITH ENERGIES JUST ABOVE THE K-ABSORPTION EDGE OF IODINE (33.3 KEV). THIS CHARACTERISTIC MAKES SM-145 SOURCES AN IDEAL CANDIDATE FOR RADIATION ENHANCEMENT WITH THYMIDINE ANALOG IODINATED DEOXYURIDINE (IUDR) BY STIMULATING CASCADES OF AUGER ELECTRONS RESULTING FROM PHOTOIONIZATION OF THE IODINE. THUS, SM-145 OFFERS A NEW POSSIBILITY FOR MAXIMIZING THE EFFECTS OF IUDR RADIOSENSITIZATION IN COMBINATION WITH BRACHYTHERAPY, WHICH ARE BEING INVESTIGATED BY NCI SPONSORED PROTOCOLS AT YALE, OHIO STATE AND BNL. THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCING A HIGH QUALITY, LEAKAGE FREE, ENCAPSULATED SOURCE OF SM-145 AND COMMERCIALIZING THIS NEW BRACHYTHERAPY SOURCE.",

With the current trends in aircraft design and execution driving maneuvering requirements for military aircraft to progressively higher angles of attack the need for such a facility is becoming paramounnt. The availability of the existing research facility at Wright Laboratory's Vertical Wind Tunnel provides the opportunity to develop test apparatus to provide the necessary static and dynamic test information for the appropriate analysis and simulation of aircraft characteristics. As a result, a thorough evaluation of the Air Force facility in conjunction with future test requirements must be made to ensure that the new test apparatus will be capable of providing all required test data and will be of high quality.",

The distortions resulting from data nonlinearity will be corrected by a calibration process acting upon the x-ray data. The blurring errors will be avoided by performing the measurement in the Fourier transform domain. This method can be used to perform automated, nondestructive inspection of crucial parts, such as turbine blades and rocket nozzles, for which substandard dimensions can cause failure. The preliminary system is expected to measure wall thicknesses down to 0.5 mm with better than 1% accuracy, but the method can be used to measure much thinner walls in small components.",

The key approach will be the use of bacteriorhodopsin thin films as read/write holographic storage media. During the six month period that is the subject of this grant proposal, we plan to test the feasibility of this approach by performing the materials devel- opment and characterization experiments described in Section E. Briefly, the specific objectives of this Phase I proposal are to: a. Develop a process to make prototype, uniform, optical quality thin films of bacteriorhodopsin or bacteriorhodopsin-polymer films; b. Test the holographic properties of the thin films of bacteriorhodopsin, including diffraction efficiency, sensitivity and response times; c. Develop concepts and designs for materials improvements that optimize the quality of bacteriorhodopsin films for dynamic holography. During Phase II, we plan to produce and optimize the bacteriorhodopsin variants conceptualized during the Phase I effort. Properties to be optimized include protein growth and expression parameters, synthesis techniques and materials processing and deposition techniques.",

Since formaldehyde is carcinogenic, toxic and malodorous, any safe, cost-effective alternative would be a marketable an medical success. The long-term objective is to benefit patient care, employee safety, and cost effectiveness by establishing an economically competitive, non-toxic, market alternative to formaldehyde. The short-term objective is to test the effectiveness of a new cost-effective cold disinfectant technology for dialysis membranes following human use. A secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of this disinfecting process on maintaining fiber bundle volume (FBV). A clinically relevant Phase I study evaluating the effect of the cold disinfecting agent on dialyzer membranes will be performed. Biocidal effectiveness will be determined by culturing the dialyzer membranes following a typical 72-hour storage. A second in vitro protocol to evaluate FBV will also be done using dialysis membranes and plasma. The FBV data will be compared to previously obtained data from our unit as well as published observations on maintaining FBV. These protocols should provide relevant and sufficient data to thoroughly evaluate this cold sterilant and, if successful, provide sufficient preliminary work to substantiate a Phase II study.",

A NON-TOXIC, MACROMOLECULAR CONTRAST AGENT, WILL IMPROVE RESOLUTION OF VASCULAR PATHOLOGY, PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT TISSUE PERFUSION AND MAY INCREASE THE DETECTION SENSITIVITY OF CERTAIN TYPES OF TUMORS. WE WILL, IN COLLABORATION WITH EXTERNAL CONSULTANTS, MEASURE RELAXIVITIES OF THREE CHELATOR-POLYMER CONJUGATES, DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT AND ESTABLISH INITIAL SAFETY MARGINS IN ANIMALS. ASSUMING THAT THIS FEASIBILITY STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT THESE COMPOUNDS ARE NON-TOXIC AND YIELD SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED IMAGE CONTRAST, WE WILL BE IN A POSITION TO DEVELOP A DIAGNOSTIC AGENT WITH A SUBSTANTIAL MARKET POTENTIAL.",

Black Entertainment Television Productions, (wholly owned subsidiary of Black Entertainment Television) will be responsible for production and placement of the prototype for broadcast on BET. The content and viewer interest will be evaluated using focus groups comprised of individuals representative of BET's viewers. Information obtained from Phase I, in conjunction with the successful production of the prototype, will facilitate the Phase II production of subsequent healthcare informational programming. Collectively, these activities will establish BioTechnical Communications as a major producer of targeted healthcare information for commercial broadcast. If successful, substantial revenues will be generated from the commercial broadcast of these productions: BioTechnical Communications will generate revenues through the sale of its productions; BET will generate revenues through the commercial sponsorship of the programming; advertisers will have a high quality media product with which to associate their product and an economical vehicle for targeting their advertising to the African-American population.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal describes the design and testing of new enzyme-based amperometric sensors for the neurochemically important species, choline, acetylcholine and glutamate. In these devices, the electrical communication between the flavin redox centers of an oxidase and an electrode is achieved via a network of donor-acceptor relays chemically bound to a highly flexible polymer. Because the electron transfer mediators are covalently attached to an insoluble polymer and cannot diffuse away from the electrode, these sensors should be suitable for implantation; thus, they would be useful for in vivo neurochemical research. The research plan concerns the development of highly sensitive and selective micro-biosensors which can be used as implantable probes or in combination with conventional microdialysis techniques. The sensors should permit detection of these neurochemicals over much shorter time scales than presently available assays.",

ALTHOUGH, THE COMMONLY USED NEUTRON DETECTOR ARRAY CONSISTING OF MULITWIRE HE-3 CAMERA IS CAPABLE OF EXCELLENT PHOTONIC BACKGROUND REJECTION, ITS USE IS SEVERELY LIMITED DUE TO LOW SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND COUNT RATE LIMITATIONS. TO OVERCOME THESE DIFFICULTIES, DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW CLASS OF HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION NEUTRON DETECTORS BASED UPON SUPERCONDUCTING ENERGY-SENSITIVE STRUCTURES IS PLANNED. A DETECTOR WITH A FEW SQUARE CENTIMETER AREA, EXCELLENT SPATIAL RESOLUTIN AND HIGH DETECTION EFFICIENCY WILL BE DEVELOPED. THE CRUCIAL COMONENT OF THIS DETECTOR WILL BE A LARGE ARRAY (2048 X 2048) OF SUPERCONDUCTING SENSORS DEPOSITED ON THE SURFACE OF A NEUTRON ABSORBER (E.G. BORON, BORON NITRIDE, OR LITHIUM HYDRIDE) WHICH WILL ACT AS A NEUTRON TO ALPHA PARTICLE \"CONVERTER\". SUCH A DETECTOR CAN ATTAIN A SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF A FEW TENS OF MICRONS WITH A REASONABLE NUMBER ( 256) OF READOUT CHANNELS. IN PHASE I, A PROTOTYPE DETECTOR ON THE SURFACE OF A BORON NITRITE SUBSTRATE WILL BE FABRICATED. FURTHEMORE, A MULTICHANNEL ELECTRONIC READOUT SYSTEM WILL BE DEVELOPED TO ENABLE QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS OF THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND QUANTUM DETECTION EFFICIENCY.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Despite enormous investments made to implement patient information systems, reports of problems and inadequacies are widespread. Difficulties in access and utilization result from the lack of 1) uniform standards for minimum data sets, 2) open systems architecture, and 3) a system for tracking and updating medical records as patients move through different health care institutions. As a result, duplication of tests and prescribed medications occurs which is not only dangerous to patients, but contributes to soaring health care costs. An innovative approach is necessary to re-engineer the patient information system to achieve an effective, efficient health care system. We will undertake a comprehensive approach to address these problems. Blue Chip will 1) apply information engineering to develop a minimum patient data set to be implemented on a client-server based Relational Database System; 2) design an open system technology based on client-server distributed network information system to solve the data interoperability and systems integration problems; 3) design a uniform patient ID system and data interchange standard to allow vital patient information to be transferred throughout the continuum of care.",

The potential drawback of CH4 arcjet is formation of soot that could cause spacecraft contamination and decreased performance. In the Phase I program we will determine the extent of soot formation and explore ways to reduce it. This will be done by testing four nozzle/anode geometries in a 2kW methane arcjet. The plasma expansion rate and nozzle temperature distribution are the major test parmeters. Following the parametric tests, an eight hour duration test will be conducted with a selected anode geometry at a selected operating condition. Additionally, we will construct and test a new cathode that has the potential for unlimited lifetime and reduced cathode voltage drops, which is based on previous work with CH4 plasmas. The experimental program will be supported by concurrent numerical analysis of soot formation. This work will be performed by a subcontractor - Aerodyne Research, Inc.",

We will investigate the properties and behaviors of integrated intelligent structures consisting of advanced composite laminates, embedded shape-memory alloys (SMA) and piezoelectric laminates, and an optimal control system. Innovative concepts discussed in this proposal will be implemented and examined. Phase I activities include: (1) modeling and prediction of stability and deformations at high Mach numbers and temperatures; (2) design and analysis of optimal SMA, piezoelectric sensor and actuator configurations; (3) design and development of static and dynamic control algorithms; (4) investigation of the interactions between supersonic aerodynamics, thermal effects, dynamic control systems, intelligent material and the nonlinear response of laminated composite panels; (5) examinatin of weight trade-off between active (piezoelectric) and passive (SMA) materials; (6) investigation of the reliability and fail-safe design. Experimental validations will be accomplished in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Assessing the environmental structural damage caused by U.S. Air Force supersonic flight operations is costly and time consuming. A contributing factor is the need for dedicated site flyovers. These are required to measure (i) the sonic boom induced pressure field on the structure, whihc owing to diffraction and scattering, is site specific, and (ii) the induced response of the structure, to be related to peak stress. It is proposed that the use of structural-acoustic reciprocity techniques would allow the U.S. Air Force to circumvent this requirement and in turn reduce the associated costs. Such techniques have been used successfully for other structural-acoustic applications, for example the shock response of ships to underwater explosions. With this approach, a vibration source substitutes for the flyover and microphones and accelerometers substitute for stress measurements. Digital post processing of the measured signals allows for the simulation of virtually arbitrarily shaped free field booms. The approach is valid for the seismic response of the structure, e.g., to sonic boom-coupled Rayleigh waves as well as for the direct effect of the overpressure on its surface.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Piezoelectric ceramic sensors and multilayer actuators with enhanced performance are required for applications in health monitoring and active vibration control in space structures. The technology of producing highly reactive submicron perovskite (ABO3) materials known as \"reactive calcination\" is proposed. Enhanced performance due to processing at temperature<200 degrees Celsius below that of conventional methods, results in fine-grain microstructures (less than or greater than 1 micrometer) with minimal microstructural property dependency. The ability to fabricate ultra-fine grain piezoelectric materials is essential in the fabrication of miniature sensors, e.g. shear or lateral and especially for low voltage multilayer actuators capable of operational voltages less than or greater than 25 volts. In addition, the inherently low processing temperatures offers the potential of low cost 70Ag:30Pd internal electrodes in contrast to platinum. Fabrication and evaluation of Navy Types I and II PZT-based piezoelectric sensors and low power actuators will provide further evidence of the level of performance achievable through enhanced processing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Cavitation is believed to cause damage to tilting disk mitral mechanical heart valves (MHVs). Previous studies have indicated that this phenomenon may be dominant during MHV closure. The \"squeeze-flow\" field between the closing occluder and valve housing, water hammer pulse at closure and the Venturi effect are possible contributing factors. These underlying physical mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated yet. A two phase study is proposed for systematically investigating cavitation in tilting disk MHVs using a combined experimental-nu- merical approach. During Phase I, a computer model will be developed for detailed investigation of the \"squeeze-flow\" effect which occurs in regions where cavitation damage has been observed in MHV explants. The valve closure velocity data, needed for these simulations, will be measured at different physiologic flow conditions in mono and bileaflet MHVs. These experiments will be performed by Dr. Ned Hwang at the University of Miami. In Phase II, a similar methodology will be used for investigating the remaining flow mechanisms that could induce cavitation. The computer models will be validated experimentally and then used to correlate the cavitation potential of tilting disk MHVs with the valve design parameters.",

The technology will be used to recover valuable organic soluts, such as flavor and fragrance chemicals, from aqueous waste streams.  In Phase I we addressed the recovery of onion flavor from an aqueous waste stream generated during the production of onion oil.  We successfully demonstrated the technical and economic feasibility of the proposed process, which relies on selective partitioning of flavor components from the aqueous waste into a food-grade oil.  We demonstrated that onion-flavor can be recovered at high concentrations in the product oil and that the overall production costs are very low--about 1% of the oil's selling price.\r \r The proposed Phase II program will be focused on optimization of the technology of processing onion wastewater and other target aqueous food wastes, including the recovery of orange essence and organic acids from aqueous wastes.  In Phase II we will also construct and test a prototype field-test system, and we will perform comprehensive engineering and economic analyses.  The overall goal of the proposed Phase II program is to bring the technology to the point that is can be commericialized in Phase III.  A major manufacturer and user of natural flavors has agreed to sign a Follow-On funding Commitment for Phase III.  This company recognizes that there is a need for new technology to recover dilute organics from aqueous waste streams in food-processing plants.  During Phase II this company will assist through the identification of commercially important streams on which to test the technology and through technical and engineering assistance.",

THE INNOVATIVE TUBING INCORPORATES MEANS TO MEASURE INLET AND OUTLET PRESSURE NONINVASIVELY, POSSESSES EXTENDED PUMPING LIFE, IS INHERENTLY SELF-REGULATING AND REQUIRES A PUMP WITH A FRACTION OF THE POWER NEEDED FOR PRESENT PUMP TUBING. THE TUBING CAN BE USED WITH STANDARD ROLLER PUMPS TO ELIMINATE THEIR INHERENT DANGERS OF EXCESSIVE SUCTION, AIR EMBOLISM, THROMBOSIS, DAMAGE TO THE VESSEL'S INTIMA AND/OR PUMPING AIR TO THE PATIENT WHEN A DECREASE IN BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE PUMP OCCURS WITHOUT A CONCOMITANT DECREASE IN PUP SPEED. THE TUBING CAN ALSO BE USED TO ELIMINATE THE EXTREME OUTLET PRESSURES, THAT CAN \"BLOW\" PARTS OF THE CIRCUUIT, DUE TO ACCIDENTAL OBSTRUCTION OF THE PUMP OUTLET. A LOW POWER, COMPACT, COMPUTERIZED PUMP THAT UTILIZES THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TUBING TO SAFETY CONTROL PUMP FLOW AND PREVENT EXCESS INLET AND/OR OUTLET PUMP PRESSURES WOULD ALSO BE DESIGNED. THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED FOR ROLLER PUMPS USED FOR EXTRACORPOREAL CIRCULATION CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO IV INFUSION AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS. THE TUBING COULD PROVIDE THE ADVANTAGES OF CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS AT A FRACTION OF THE COST (ABOUT $20/EA VS. $150EA).",

Existing subpicosecond sources are complex devices requiring large, heavy, power-inefficient Argon-ion lasers, Nd:YAG, or similar lasers as primary pump sources. There is an existing need for compact ultrafast sources that can be used outside the R&D; laboratory setting.

Two types of software documentation are typically produced: (l) formal documentation describing the structure, interfaces, data types and other mathematical properties of software, and (2) semantic documentation describing the meaning and purpose of software components and actions. Our automation of formal documentation will make use of data about software structure obtainable from CASE tools. Semantic documentation will require either a specialized domain (either by application domain or by system type) or additional structured input from users. The modularity of our proposed text generator design and the linguistic sophistication of our underlying language model will allow the production of fluent, professional-quality documentation from a wide variety of information sources (difrerent CASE representations or user input), The proposed documentation generator framework will use text planning and grammatical knowledge to produce more fluent generated text than is possible with template-based approaches and have less need for augmentation by manually created free text. By decreasing the reliance on manual documentation we will guarantee better consistency between software documentation and program code via the specifications which guide the production of code.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Two forms of turbine expander are proposed. One, the single-rotor, partial admission, multistage, reentry type reaction turbine, is suitable for use at any realizable pressure ratio and should be especially effective in low mass flow engines because rotor blade Reynolds number can be maximized for a given flow area. The other, a modified form of the radial flow turbine, is adaptable to and abets structural compactness in both conventional gas turbine engines and systems based upon high pressure ratio wave engines. Both expanders inherently increase the maximum allowable material-limited gas inlet temperature because of the temperature averaging effect of the gas streams. The unsteady gas dynamics involved in the reentry type reaction turbine requires the modificationn and upgrading of existing computer simulation programs in order to address some of the unique characteristics of this machine and provide data for the design of a laboratory test rig. However, current capabilities in numerical techniques and modern computers permit effective solution of these problems. The performance and basic structural analysis of the radial flow turbine variant can be carried out with existing programs. These two expanders can drastically broaden the range of gas turbine propulsion applications.",

An engaging entertaining TV-based technology, CD-i, should greatly enhance outcomes over passive video tapes or printed materials for educational and behavior-change programs for memory retention. This Phase I project will develop and field test a prototype CD-i called 'The Memory Works' to show how it increases the ability to recall items when greater attention is paid. Phase I aims are 1) develop a plan, design document and functional specs for a limited-scope prototype disc, 2) produce a prototype CD-i disc demonstrating how to remember names and faces, and 3) field test the concept for efficacy. Phase II intervention will fully develop 'The Memory Works' to meet a variety of memory retention skill needs for individual behavior change for a broader age range. It includes additional memory domains, improved mental vigor and normative memory changes; other training choices and preventive screenings from Phase I will result. Philips Interactive Media of America has agreed to co-fund and distribute 'The Memory Works' when published.",

The technique described is an extension to the multiresolutional algorithms used presently for compression, and particularly an extension of the wavelet transform. A company developed technique image analysis system will be coupled to the transform theory to provide the necessary compression to enable transmission of continuous video over low bandwidth communication lines such as HF communication used in ship to ship communications. Because these continuous images can be considered from a three dimensional viewpoint with small changes between frames, the concept proposed is to apply an extended three dimensional transform to those regions where change has occurred.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The idea of automated processing of imagery has been the desire of technology since devices to collect volumes of images have been in operation. In this proposal we discuss the relative merits of automated image processing in the spatial and transform domain. We suggest that with the development of wavelets and vector quantization (VQ) used in compression, the possibility exists to use the values in the transform space to perform pattern recognition. In addition, we have combined the wavelet transform with the affine transform of fractal compression to provide a means to represent features in a rotation and magnification independent format. Once can use these transform coefficients or identifiers (in the case of VQ and fractals) to represent the components of the image. Using these values, it is possible to apply finite inductive sequences (FI) to strings of these identifiers for the purpose of pattern recognition. The FI technique is briefly explained and its application to this process is described. The proposed data structure for storage and communication is the coefficients from the transform space, whatever they turn out to be.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A new detector consisting of a monolithic array of silicon avalanche photodiodes (APDs) coupled to a bismuth germanate (BGO) scintillator array will be fabricated and tested. The prototype detector array will be evaluated for its potential to be incorporated into a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner that will have higher resolution than any commercial scanner presently available. Since APDs can be fabricated using semiconductor processes that are intrinsically less expensive and more reliable than the techniques used to build photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), detector arrays built using APDs may be the only cost-effective means of achieving the higher resolution needed to improve the detection and localization of PET. The architecture of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) will also be developed to process the low- noise, high-speed signals provided by the detector array. During Phase II of this project, an optimized APD array will be developed and the associated ASIC architecture will be implemented. A packaging scheme will be devised to permit the ASIC electronics to be attached directly to the APD/BGO detector module. The final product of Phase II will be a detector/electronics module suitable for incorporation into a higher resolution PET system.",

Their remarkable sensitivity has created interest in their use as detectors of mines and submarines, but their value to date has been limited by the need to cool them with liquid helium. This situation has now changed, as SQUIDs now operate at 77K in liquid nitrogen. We propose a design study to evaluate the performance of such high temperature SQUIDs, to identify Navy applications that are made possible because of the reduced cost, weight and size of systems utilizing such SQUIDs, and to design a prototype system for Navy use.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The development of a portable, easy to use instrument for the direct measurement of the alpha activity weighted particle size distributions in indoor environments composed primarily of radon decay progeny is proposed. Our methods for achieving this are based on the use of wire screen collectors and low cost alpha particle detectors to completely characterize the size distribution of the radio-aerosols over the particle size range 0.3 - 500 nm. Our measurement technique will allow the simultaneous measurement of the alpha particle energy spectrum of the size selected aerosols which are sequentially deposited on wire screen filters in the detector. The activity weighted particle size distribution can then be inferred from these measurements using an unfolding technique. Inhaled radon progeny, particularly those due to the \"unattached\" fraction, are estimated to be the dominant sources of background radiation that deliver significant doses to the tissues or cells of the respiratory tract. Phase I will result in the construction, testing, and calibration of a laboratory working model of the particle size sampler. Phase I will demonstrate that a transportable monitor based on wire screen arrays, low cost solid state alpha particle detectors, and associated electronics can be reliably utilized. During Phase II, we will configure the technology into a relatively inexpensive system. This system will be readily transportable for real time measurement of activity weighted radon progeny particle size distributions in environments where complete characterization of the alpha activity is required. Phase III will involve commercialization of this technology through fabrication and sales of various stand-alone instruments based on the technology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGY FOR PRODUCING HIGH QUALITY SINGLE CRYSTAL SiC WAFERS AND THIN FILMS PRESENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO FABRICATE SOLID-STATE DEVICES WITH POWER-TEMPERATURE CAPABILITY FAR GREATER THAN DEVICES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THIS CAPABILITY IS IDEALLY SUITED TO THE APPLICATION OF POWER CONDITIONING ON THE ALL-ELECTRIC AIRPLANE, TURBINE ENGINE ACTUATORS, AND SPACE-BASED POWER SYSTEMS. THESE APPLICATIONS REQUIRE SWITCHES AND AMPLIFIERS CAPABLE OF LARGE CURRENTS WITH RELATIVELY LOW VOLTAGE DROPS. WHILE CONVENTIONAL SILICON POWER DEVICES ARE ALREADY BEING USED NEAR THEIR LIMITS OF OPERATING TEMPERATURE AND POWER, THE POTENTIAL OF SiC IS JUST BEGINNING TO BE DEMONSTRATED. VERTICAL POWER MOSFET STRUCTURES FABRICATED IN 6H-SiC WITH 50 V CAPABILITY HAVE ALREADY SHOWN CURRENT AND POWER DENSITIES AS HIGH AS 191 A/CM2 AND 5.4 KW/CM2. THE SPECIFIC ON-RESISTANCE (R Ds(on)) OF THESE DEVICES WERE AS LOW AS 37.5 M -CM2. THESE DEVICES SHOWED GOOD CHARACTERISTICS AT TEMPERATURES UP TO 300 0C. WHILE THESE ARE PROMISING RESULTS, IT IS PREDICTED THAT MUCH BETTER RESULTS COULD BE ACHIEVED IF THESE DEVICES WERE FABRICATED IN 4H-SiC. THE 4H POLYTYPE OF SiC HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE AN ELECTRON MOBILITY ALMOST TWICE THAT OF 6H-SiC, WHICH WOULD GREATLY REDUCE THE R ds(on) OF A SiC POWER DEVICE. ADDITIONALLY, THE WIDER BANDGAP (3.26 eV) OF 4H WILL RESULT IN AN EVEN HIGHER BREAKDOWN FIELD THAN 6H-SiC, WHICH IN TURN ALLOWS ANOTHER REDUCTION IN R ds(on). THEREFORE, IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE USE OF 4H-SiC BE EVALUATED FOR A HIGH TEMPERATURE POWER MOSFET. THIS EFFORT WILL INCLUDE THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ELECTRON MOBILITY OF 4H-SiC, PARALLEL TO THE C-AXIS, USING HALL EFFECT MEASUREMENTS. PLANER MOSFETS WILL ALSO BE FABRICATED IN 4H-SiC IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE CHANNEL MOBILITY OF THESE DEVICES. ADDITIONALLY, ONE BATCH OF VERTICAL POWER MOSFETS WILL BE FABRICATED TO PROVE THE VIABILITY OF THE STRUCTURE. BOTH THE PLANAR AND VERTICAL DEVICES WILL ALSO BE MEASURED AT HIGH TEMPERATURE.",

This computer software will faithfully simulate the functional aspects of cardiopulmonary physiology, using state-of-the-art mathematical models. For the first time, students at all levels will have the freedom to learn medical physiology and therapeutics by doing, rather than by watching. They will analyze, diagnose, and treat patients by operating the simulator using patient scenario models that configure the system to simulate a patient with a specific critical illness (e. g., status asthmaticus, Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis syndrome, etc.). By the end of Phase I, a functional simulator will be completed which simulates left and right heart dynamic performance, pulmonary gas exchange in a 50 compartment model of the lung, the systemic and pulmonary circulations including autonomic control and transvascular fluid balance, systemic gas exchange, and renal electrolyte and fluid exchange. Students will operate the simulator through a user-friendly graphical user interface operating under the Microsoft Windows environment. In Phase II, clinical case scenario modules will be added, along with a hypertext-type Help function. In addition, extensive testing will be carried out during Phase II. Virtually every English-speaking physician, surgeon, anesthesiologist, and student could benefit from this system, so the potential market is enormous.",

This material is an excellent potential substitute for LBO in high average power nonlinear optical devices, like third harmonic generation of Nd:YAG and in OPO applications. Small crystals have been grown using the TSSG method, but application of the HTS growth method should produce large, high optical quality material at reasonable costs. The development of a growth technique and optimization of the solvent system will permit production of large single crystals, which offer an alternative to LBO and BBO.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Reducing the dynamic response of spacecraft during launch will have a number of benefits in their design, test, and operations phases and will allow mission performance, rather than launch survivability, to be the primary goal of structural design. This SBIR proposes to integrate an isolation system into the interface adaptor between the launch vehicle and the spacecraft. Besides the increase in launch survivability, a pauload isolator system will also reduce cost, weight, and size of some spacecraft components; allow isolator redesign rather than spacecraft requalification; relieve launch vehicle loads; and relax dynamic coupling design, analysis and test requirements. Phase I of this effort will develop concepts and provide supporting analysis for an innovative payload/adaptor isolation system. Phase I will determine which passive and/or active vibration control technologiess are most applicable. A preliminary design of a payload/adaptor/isolation will be formulated, and analysis will be performed to determine it effectiveness. Work will also begin on a comprehensive spacecraft isolator design procedure. Phase II will demonstrate system effectiveness for representative payload and launch vehicle configurations through critical component hardware testing coupled with additional analysis and simulation. Phase III will provide a adaptor/isolator system for flight demonstration.",

BECAUSE MUCH OF THE WATER AND SOLUTE FLOW INFORMATION SOUGHT TYPICALLY OCCURS WITHIN THE EXPECTED RANGE OF OUR PROPOSED ONE-STEP PRESSURE CELL (0 TO 1 BAR), A LARGE PORTION OF THE NECESSARY HYDRAULIC INFORMATION POTENTIALLY CAN BE OBTAINED WITH ONE AUTOMATED MEASUREMENT.

S S will have access to the best acoustic prediction models and data. Settings which provide good performance in one acoustic enviroriment may be subpar in other envirormients. We propose to design SRAPS to interface with SPARS to take advantage of existing and planned SPARS features. This is a low risk approach because Wagner Associates is currently developing a search module for M APB, based on CCAS, which is interoperable with SPARS. SRAPS will feature advanced mathematical techniques in integer prograiTiming. The resource allocation problem belongs to a set of integer prograi.Tiing problems #!ich is called \"NP-hard.\" An approach is described which will produce near-opti-mal solutions with short runti-mes. Also, the SRAPS user interface will incorporate good hum an factors design and lead surveillance system operators in a logical fashion through the process of determining system settings. The se ^ence of operator prompts will be designed so that the current situation will determine priorities and recorrmendations. Phase I will consist of algorithm development and system interface design. Phase II wLll provide a full-scale working prototn)e system suitable for operational evaluation and iiRplementation .",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal offers an innovative methodology to measure and improve shipyard productivity. The methodology creates a cooperative reporting environment in which labor and management seek to accomplish identical performance goals. Measures distinguish between two kinds of labor lost due to reasons beyond labor control. Lost time includes suchurs activities as waiting for materials or equipment, crew reassignment or rework due to design changes. Counts of work actually accomplished divided by the hours actually worked at that task provide a \"true\" unit rate that accurately measures labor performance for each task. Measures of lost time hours, categorized by reason, provide a prioritized list of problems requiring management action. Regular identification of the best unit rates and recognition for crews that set new performance records generates positive feedback to both labor and management. The ratio of the best rate to the average rate serves as an indicator of management performance. Projecting the hours required to complete the remaining work quantifies the potential worth of pursuing alternative productivity gains. The methodology is simple to apply, requires minimum extra time or paperwork, allows crews to measure and report their own productivity, and costs little to implement.",

The system dynamics methodology models the myriad cause-and-effect relationships that define the shipbuilding process. The model, presented in clear diagramatic form, includes the complex web of feedback linkages responsible for the dynamic behavior of the ship construction process. This dynamic behavior includes the ability to replicate the \"wave of disruption\" that, once triggered by a delay, often seems to propagate itself far beyond its starting time (and place). Analysis of the causes for delays and their impact on system behavior will lead to discovery of effective policies and actions to limit their detrimental effect on USN ship construction costs and schedules. The simulation model will build upon the USN shipbuilding model development already accomplished under SBIR N91-147.",

HAVDEM IS AN ENGAGEMENT LEVEL SIMULATION OF HELICOPTER AIR-TO-AIR COMBAT DEVELOPED BY DSA AND THE AVSCOM AVIATION APPLIED TECHNOLOGY DIRECTORATE (AATD) AT FT. EUSTIS. ITS PHYSICAL MODELS, AERODYNAMICS, WEAPONS, AND SENSORS, ARE DERIVED FROM HELIPAC AND ITS PILOT DECISION LOGIC IS DERIVED FROM DSA'S TAC BRAWLER FIXED-WING COMBAT SIMULATION. HAVDEM'S MOST UNIQUE FEATURE IS THE PILOT DECISION LOGIC'S ABILITY TO EXPLOIT HIGH RESOLUTION DIGITIZED TERRAIN DATA TO AVOID DETECTION AND PLAN TACTICS. THIS REALISTIC PILOT BEHAVIOR CAN BE APPLIED TO AIR-TO-GROUND MISSIONS AS WELL. OUR PHASE I EFFORT WILL DEFINE THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR HELICOPTER AIR-TO-GROUND MISSIONS THAT ARE NOT ALREADY REPRESENTED BY HAVDEM'S AIR-TO-AIR FEATURES AND DEFINE THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS WHICH ENABLE THE HELICOPTERS TO MANEUVER COOPERATIVELY. WHILE BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE A SMALL AMOUNT OF MUTUAL SUPPORT, CURRENT HAVDEM PILOTS ARE ESSENTIALLY INDEPENDENT. COOPERATIVE BEHAVIOR ENABLES FLIGHTS OF HELICOPTERS TO PERFORM COORDINATED TACTICS FOR BOTH AIR-TO-AIR AND AIR-TO-GROUND MISSIONS.",

A recombinant IPNV subunit vaccine (pTA1) has been developed and consists of a lysate of Escherichia coli cells that expressed IPNV VP2, NS and VP3 proteins.  The Phase I research confirmed that the recombinant pTA1 vaccine was effective in laboratory scale trials and indicated that this vaccine construct was the most potent.  Vaccines containing the VP2 gene or the 5' end of the VP2 gene induced intermediate and no protection, respectively.  The pTA1 vaccine protected fish against two heterologous IPNV isolates in the West Buxton serotype and was more efficacious when prepared from a bioreactor culture versus shake cultures.\r \r The Phase II research will investigate three areas critical to the production of a commercial IPNV vaccine.  These areas include:  optimization of the conditions for bacterial growth and fusion protein induction; development of a standard vaccination protocol for use at hatcheries through optimization of vaccination parameters; and development of an in vitro ELISA potency test.  Vaccine efficacy will also be evaluated in three species of salmonid fish against several IPNV isolates belonging to different serotypes and tested under field conditions.",

THE T-LAYER MHD CONCEPT IS AN INNOVATIVE IDEA FOR PRACTICAL APPLICATION TO MHD POWER. THE VIABILITY OF THE T-LAYER MHD POWER PROCESS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN THE LABORATORY. T-LAYER MHD IS A PROCESS WHEREIN A HIGH TEMPERATURE PLASMA LAYER, A T-LAYER, IS PRODUCED IN THE FLOW STREAM OF AN MHD DEVICE USING EXTERNAL EXCITATION, e.g., ELECTRIC DISCHARGE. THE T-LAYER FORMED BY THE HIGH ENERGY EXCITATION IS A FULLY IONIZED PLASMA WITH EXTREMELY HIGH ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY. IN THE T-LAYER MHD GENERATOR, THE T-LAYER PASSES THROUGH THE GENERATOR PRODUCING USEFUL EXTERNAL ELECTRIC POWER ACCORDING TO STANDARD MHD POWER PRINCIPLES. THE GENERATOR HAS ADVANTAGES OVER THE COMBUSTION DRIVENMHD GENERATOR THAT MAKE IT AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE POWER SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE, IT HAS CONTINUOUS ELECTRODE CONSTRUCTION,AND SIMPLE POWER CONSOLIDATION AND ISOLATION NEEDS; IN ADDITION, IT CAN OPERATE WITH A LOW TEMPERATURE BULK FLUID WITHOUT IONIZATION SEED. THE T-LAYER MHD GENERATOR CAN PRODUCE AN AC ELECTRICAL OUTPUT SIGNAL. IT HAS HIGH POWER DENSITY AND CAN BE MADECOMPACT AND LIGHTWEIGHT. PHASE I WILL DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A T-LAYER MHD AC GENERATORAS A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT. IT WILL ANALYZE THE PHYSICS OF THIS DEVICE AND ARRIVE AT A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN FOR A POWER SYSTEM. IT WILL ALSO DETERMINE THE BEST NEAR TERM APPLICATION AND MARKET FOR THE AC GENERATOR AS A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT. PHASE I WILL DEFINE AN EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS AND LABORATORY FOR PHASE II IN WHICH PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE TESTS CAN BE CONDUCTED.",

THE REMOTE SENSING DIAGNOSTICS DEVELOPED IN THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WOULD PROVIDE GREATER AND MORE RELIABLE ELECTRICAL ISOLATION THAN ISAVAILABLE WITH CURRENT POWER PLANT TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS TRANSFORMER BASED ISOLATION AMPLIFIERS. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCT A REMOTE SENSING VOLTAGE PROBE. THIS PROBE WILL UNDERGO EXTENSIVE BENCH TOP TESTING TO CHARACTERIZE ITS BASIC CAPABILITIES AND SENSITIVITY TO FRINGE STRENGTH MAGNETIC FIELDS. THE BENCH SCALE TESTING WILL BE FOLLOWED BY IN-SITU TESTINGON AN OPERATIONAL MHD FLOW TRAIN IN WHICH A SINGLE MEASUREMENT, COMBUSTOR VOLTAGE TO GROUND, WILL BE USED TO GAUGE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE REMOTE VOLTAGE PROBE IN AN MHD ENVIRONMENT. DC AND AC PROBE PERFORMANCE WILL BE DETERMINED FROM DATA GATHERED DURING STEADY STATE AND TRANSIENT OPERATION OF THE FLOW TRAIN.

The developed software will also provide a dependent measure to determine the effectiveness of food guide concepts. A specialized database will be developed from an existing database, which consists of single food items, mixed dishes, and combination foods in standard serving sizes. Three groups, including experts, users, and professionals, will be used to formatively evaluate the software.

Both Vacuum Extraction and Bioremediation are acceptable means for in situ soil decontamination; however, both have practical limits related to soil temperature. Vacuum Extraction is limited to semi-volatiles, a vapor pressure/molecular weight criteria, while bioremediation is vastly affected by soil temperature and climatic variations. The project objective is to study the effectiveness of a novel, low-cost and hazard-free technology to warm soil for the purpose of accelerating these known and acceptable processes without the use of radio frequency or electricity. Specific objectives are to: 1. Improve an existing model for the flow of heat from the company's proprietary energy source. 2. Study how heat flow varies with air flowing through the soil using the proposed warming technology. 3. Estimate the per-ton cost for a field site remediation application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The overall goal of this program is the development of tools for rapid synthesis of common classes of electronic systems. DQDT's approach is to create generators which synthesize application specific VHDL descriptions of systems from high-level specifications. These generators can then leverage readily available and constantly improving VHDL based CAD tools for simulation, gate level synthesis, and mask level synthesis. By synthesizing at the VHDL level, these generators have complete independence from the chip fabrication vendor, the CAD tool vendor, and the hardware platform. Also, the inherent technology retargeting and upgrading capability of this approach shields new systems from early obsolescence due to rapidly improving chip technology. Through a novel use of standard VHDL constructs, the proposed generators offer the user control over the amount and degree of bit-level pipelining and over the implementation style of arithmetic elements. These features significantly broaden the speed-area solution space beyond existing gate level logic manipulation methods. A library of generators will be created which are oriented around common signal processing functions such as filters, convolvers, adaptive operators, and transforms. The end product of the Phase I effort will be a complete implementation of a digital filter generator tool to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The current baseline ASAT aim-point algorithm is based on a hard logic rule-based approach. The main limitation of this approach results from the combination of uncertainties in the ASAT mission. These uncertainties can not be eliminated or even significantly reduced without a tremendous expenditure of resources. ASAT needs an algorithmic approach which is designed to operate in the presence of uncertainty. During the past few years, fuzzy logic has belatedly become important design paradigm in the united States. There are a few tools available for developing fuzzy logic applications. These tools are for the most part tied to some particular hardware development system. They are also not designed ho support the ASAT application or be integrated with the current ASAT resources. We are proposing to develop a fuzzy logic tool which is primarily designed. to support the ASAT project. In addition, th&s; tool will be designsd to support a wide variety of image-based fuzzy logic design efforts. It will eventually also offer the relatively new capability of generating rules automatically through the application of neural networks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Endometrial hyperplasia (EH) is characterized by hyperproliferation of the endometrium. Women with EH are at increased risk for developing endometrial carcinoma, the most common malignant neoplasm of the urogenital tract in women. Unopposed estrogen or hyperestrogenism, which can arise from hormonal imbalances that occur during menopause, obesity, estrogen-secreting ovarian tumors, or estrogen replacement therapy, are the predominant causes of EH. Most women at some point in their life experience abnormal uterine bleeding that results from EH. These women often undergo hysterectomy which is the most over-prescribed surgical procedure in the United States. The estrogen receptor, a DNA-binding transcriptional activator that is a member of the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily, mediates the ability of the endometrial cells to respond to estrogen. In the presence of estrogen, the ligand-bound activated estrogen receptor induces changes in gene expression and proliferation of the endometrium results. This proposal describes a novel pharmaceutical agent that can be used to prevent and treat endometrial hyperplasia, especially in conjunction with estrogen replacement therapy. We will inhibit the function of the estrogen receptor locally within the uterus, but in no other tissues.",

Parameters to be established include chemical, physical, toxicological, and environmental parameters under static and dynamic conditions. A dynamic fire test will be proposed in collabortion with the Air Force or another branch of the military. Acceptable classes of potential components for the AFFF agent replacement will be defined. Specific components to be selected for formulation and evaluation purposes will include commercially available as well as developmental chemicals and polymers. Based on evaluation data to be generated which justify the recommended parameters, a fire fighting agent formulation with enhanced fire fighting capability and less impact on the environment will be developed in Phase II of AF93-009.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Electrical wiring of redox enzymes, a novel basis for making biosensors, provides a powerful method of directly electrically sensing lactate. Biosensors based on the wired enzymes have advantages in accuracy, sensitivity, speed, no leachable components, insensitivity to variation in oxygen partial pressure, insensitivity to interferants, miniaturization (high signal level and small sample size), high stability, and small associated electronics. The specific aim of the Phase I research is to develop such a lactate sensor for use in plasma and serum. Experiments thus far have been conducted in buffer solution; related work on \"wired\" glucose enzyme electrodes has been successful in serum and plasma. The long term objective is to develop a sensor suitable for use in in vitro blood gas/electrolyte monitors commonly used in cardiac units and for possible incorporation into pulmonary artery catheters that are used to measure blood O2 and CO2 levels and other parameters. Blood lactate concentrations are a sensitive marker for inadequate oxygen utilization and hence of cardiovascular or metabolic failure in critically-ill patients. If the patient is recovering from major cardiovascular or trauma surgery, a rise in blood lactate during recovery may guide the level and type of care required.",

The project will build heavily on previous and ongoing Ecodynamics work for Sandia Laboratories on the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) project and on proposed work for the U.S. Army Waterways Experiment Station. Robust, efficient, high-accuracy algorithms embodied in user-friendly codes will be developed for 2-D and 3-D time-dependent flows, including single phase miscible flows, multi-phase flows, NAPL, and DNAPL, and saturated and unsaturated (vadose-zone) conditions. Algorithmic innovations (even in Phase I) will include facilitation of grid convergence tests in multiple domains; automatic error estimation; correct treatment of transmissivity factors for unconfined aquifers; multigrid algorithms; a convenient formulation of variable density flow equations in terms of freshwater head; boundary-fitted coordinates; temporal high-order particle tracking; efficient, accurate and robust calculation of contaminant transport (advection, dispersion and diffusion) in (possibly) fractured porous media, and up-scaling of properties in strongly heterogeneous media. The codes will be designed for modern workstations with the highest standards of verification and Quality Assurance. Installation and tutorials will be provided to Tyndall AFB.",

THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT ELECTROCHEMICAL MONITORING METHODS, THROUGH WHICH THE MAJORITY OF BIOCORROSION INFORMATION HAS BEEN OBTAINED, CAN PERTURB AND INTERFERE WITH THE MICROBIOLOGICALLY DEVELOPED ECOSYSTEM. THIS PROGRAM PROPOSES TO STUDY THE MIC MECHANISMS OF BIOCORROSION UTILIZING A NONINTRUSIVE SPECTROSCOPIC RAMAN BASED FIBER OPTIC PROBE WITH NEAR INFRARED (NIR) DIODE LASER EXCITATION. FIBER OPTIC RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY WILL ALLOW THE IN SITU MONITORING OF AQUEOUS ENVIRONMENTS BY UTILIZING THE CHARACTERISTIC VIBRATIONAL MODES OF THE REACTIVE SPECIES. THE PHASE 1 OBJECTIVE IS THE DETERMINATION OF THE FEASIBILITY OF USING NIR RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY AS A NONINTRUSIVE MONITOR FOR BIOCORROSION STUDIES.

THE PROPOSED SPECTROGRAPH WILL PERMIT A FULL (4000/CM) RAMAN SPECTRUM OF A SOLID, LIQUID OR GASEOUS SAMPLE TO BE OBTAINED IN A SINGLE RAPID MEASUREMENT WITHOUT INTERNAL MOVING PARTS OR CALIBRATION, SUCH AS ADJUSTMENT OF SLITS OR GRATINGS. THE DESIGN GOAL IS FOR LESS THAN 1/CM RESOLUTION. IN ITS FULLY DEVELOPED FORM, THE SPECTROGRAPH LASER USED FOR RAMAN EXCITATION, DETECTOR AND COMPUTER WILL BE MAN-PORTABLE. TO ACHIEVE THIS DEGREE OF PORTABILITY, A SMALL HIGH RESOLUTION ECHELLE SPECTROGRAPH HAS BEEN DESIGNED WHICH WILL INCORPORATE A SOLID STATE MICROLASER FOR EXCITATION AND A WIDE FORMAT TWO-DIMENSIONAL CHARGE COUPLED DEVICE (CCD) ARRAY FOR DETECTION. THE INSTRUMENT WILL ALSO EMPLOY A FIBER OPTIC PROBE FOR SAMPLING, WHICH WILL BE PARTICULARLY SUITABLE FOR SCANNING CONTAMINATED SURFACES AND INACCESSIBLE LOCATIONS. THE PROBE INCORPORATES A MICRO-OPTICAL TERMINATING HEAD CONTAINING FILTERS FOR REMOVAL OF SILICA FIBER RAMAN SCATTERING FROM THE SIGNAL.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The research would develop an inexpensive electroencephalographic (EEG) amplifier system suitable for dense (128 or 256) electrode arrays. These arrays would provide the measurements necessary for new source localization algorithms constrained by MRI data that image the electrical activity of the cortex throughout the three dimensions of intracranial space. Although the anatomical resolution of these images remains to be determined, they are generated for each millisecond sample of electrical recording, and thus, provide information with a temporal resolution not possible with metabolic and hemodynamic methods of neuroimaging. This temporal resolution may be necessary to research the cognitive activity of cortical networks. The major advances in visualizing dynamic brain function promised by this new technology will have immediate applications in psychology, neurology, psychiatry, education, and human factors research. Within 5 years, this research will provide the basis for widespread clinical applications of this technology to public health problems ranging from attention deficit disorder to Alzheimer's dementia.",

We propose to commercialize an apparatus that attaches 128 EEG electrodes in an even spatial array across the surface of the human head. This apparatus comprises two specific inventions by Tucker (patents pending). The first is a method for positioning sensors for individual head geometries by a network tensional structure of elastic lines forming the geodesic partitioning of a spherical surface. The second invention is a sensor pedestal, a simple device that attaches at the vertices of the geodesic triangles, such that the compression directed radially by the tensional network toward the sphere center is used to hold a simple Ag/AgCl sponge electrode against the scalp. The Geodesic Electrode Net can be applied within half an hour and worn comfortably for several hours. With appropriately-designed, inexpensive amplifiers, it yields excellent EEGs. Our visual event-related potential (ERP) data with 64-channel arrays confirms the need for dense electrode arrays to adequately characterize the information on brain activity available from the scalp EEG.",

To give the recipient of such systems maximum portability, the internal battery pack should store enough energy for 45 minutes of operation. The battery pack should be as small and light weight as possible and have a life of five years. The metal Hydride system has the potential of being 50 % smaller than the Nickel-Cadmium system, the only other viable candidate to meet this application. The program is initially directed at the development of battery components best suited for this special application and then building cells to demonstrate and test the capabilities of this system. The ultimate goal is a battery that delivers greater than 44 Wh/Kg, 150 wh/1, has a life of five years 1825 cycles ( one cycle per day) and is compatible with implantable operation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         III-V compound semiconductors are increasingly in demand for advanced electronic and optoelectronic applications. To keep abreast of the increasing demand for high speed devices, such as HEMTs or FETs, it is imperative for the III-V compound semi- conductor systems producers to make the transition from laboratory to production systems. Two main issues surrounding the epitaxial growth onto large area GaAs substrates are the layer thickness uniformity and the doping uniformity, It is important that the layer thickness of HEMT, HBT, and PET devices be uniform in order to control recess etching so that uniform threshold voltages and hence device characteristics are reproducible. The doping uniformity plays an important role in controlling the transconductance, and will be studied during this work. Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) is best suited to cost effectively produce the required materials with high yields. A strategic advance in the development of this materials technology is the shifting to 4\" to 6\" diameter process substrates. As yet, there is no established method for production of device structures on 6\" diameter substrates. In Phase II, we will demonstrate a fully automated cassette to cassette 6\" diameter wafer production capability. The Phase I and II efforts will be performed in an ENCORE high speed rotating disk vertical reactor systems, which is known to efficiently produce high quality MOCVD materials through 4\" diameter substrates.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Until recently, nearly all of the major work on pseudomorphic HEMTs has been dominated by MBE technology. Low throughput is an inherent problem with MBE equipment. For this reason EMCORE proposes to use its low pressure, high speed, rotating disk MOCVD technology for the deposition of pseudomorphic HEMT structres. The technology is scaleable so that increasing the growth chamber size to accomodate growth runs of multiple 4 in. wafers should be possible. ENCORE proposes in phase I to extend our GaAs/AIGaAs HEMT technology to the pseudomorphic HEMT structure. We will examine the In fraction InGaAs layer thickness to optimize the mobility of the structure. These will be a \"characterization\" structure grown which has an undoped GaAs cap layer so that both 300 k and 77k Hall effect measurements may be done. Also, a sheet resistivity map of the entire wafer is generated to insure film uniformity. The inital growth runs will be done on 2 in. diameter substrates. When the process has been optimized the growths will be done on 4 in. diameter wafers. These wafers will again have the sheet resistivity map prepared. Nine samples will then be cleaved in a cross pattern. 300k and 77k Halleffect measurements will be performed to examine uniformity of mobility. The most promising 2 in. sample will be sent to our consultant for device fabrication and testing. A complete device wafer (GaAs cap layer will be doped) will be made available to the Air Force for further device processing.",

This device can allow a small, battery powered acoustic source to be easily located and ranged using a small flashlight sized imager. The imager relies on the piezo-dichroic properties of a continuous layer of a dichroic material thin film that serves as both the sensor and the display. The image can be viewed directly or remotely by using a CCD camera. The source would be placed at a location as a position marker. A diver, using a hand held locator, could identify or signal several other divers with a slight sophistication of the basic device. The phenomenon used allows sensitivity levels of 10^-14 w sec/cm^2. In Phase I the contractor will investigate the engineering specifications applicable to the design of a small, hand-held, real-time, ranging acoustic imager for diver location and signaling in conditions of limited optical visibility. A brassboard model will be produced for the later prototype versions anticipated in Phase II. The extension of this concept to a full acoustic imager for use as a remote mine locator would allow the viewing of mines submerged in low or zero visiblity water.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Increasing the interlaminar strength of advanced composite materials will improve damage tolerance and permit use of thin gage facesheets for ultralightweight structural materials. This project will investigate novel means of implanting individual fibers through the thickness of laminated composites. Such reinforcement with separate fibers extending through multiple plies is expected to offer the preferred combination of mechanical properties, in which interlaminar strength is improved without degrading the in-plane strength. The fiber implantation method, which does not involve stitching or weaving, appears to be suitable for large scale processing. It may be used also with non-weavable fibers and whiskers. Phase I effort will focus on experimentation with the process variables. Diverse fiber materials, fiber diameters, fiber lengths, and laminate forms (unidirectional and woven) will be tested. An objective is control over fiber orientation and areal density as required for interlaminar reinforcement purposes. Reinforced composite samples will be fabricated and inspected. The most promising process will be used to fabricate samples for short beam mechanical testing. Potential improvements in the damage tolerance of composite facesheets and the potential for aircraft weight reduction will be assessed. Phase 2 would develop further the leading process and scale up to fabricate and test prototype composite panels.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This project aims to develop nonpermeable thin-guage carbon tubing with an integral radial carbon fiber brush on its outer surface for enhanced heat transfer. The carbon tubing is derived from polyimide tubing. The radial fiber structure is created by electrostatic flocking. Coatings to block hydrogen permeation and to prtotect against erosion are applied by chemical vapor deposition. The proposed process is suited for various guages of tubing and for various curvatures. The flocked carbon tubing my be integrated with carbon fiber preforms and processed to form an actively cooled carbon-carbon structural component for use with hot pressurized hydrogen. Phase 1 effort will focus on materials processing. We will investigate the carbonization of selected precursors, fiber flocking methods, and CVD coatings. Electron microscopy will be used to inspect the tubing wall and fiber attachment. Sections of flocked carbon tubing will be fabricated for thermal cycling, and measurements of permeation and the rate of erosion in hot hydrogen. Preliminary thermal analysis will model carbon-carbon heat exchanger structures with the new tubing to investigate design trades and assess the overal performance. A draft design for a Phase 2 prototype heat exchanger panel will be prepared. Phase 2 would continue process development, leading to fabrication of a prototype exchanger panel to be tested under conditions relevant to the NASP leading edge application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We describe our novel conceptof a magnetohydrodynamic explosive munition (MAHEM) and apply it to the design of a shaped charge. The MAHEM is an explosive warhead that utilizes magnetohydrodynamic effects to transfer the \"global\" explosive energy (that is mainly wasted in a conventional warhead) at electromagnetic speeds to a \"localized\" region where it may act on the metal mass of a shaped charge cone that is to be propelled in a given direction toward a target. Our concept exploits the phenomenon of electromagnetic braking for the purpose of transforming the kinetic energy of detonation products in one part of a system to kinetic energy of metallic ejecta in another part. Hence, the local region can become a region of huge energy accumulation. It should be possible to propel metallic ejecta at velocities much greater than can be done using expolsives alone...or to propel a much greater mass...in order to obtain greater kill probabilities. Methods for doing this are outlined, and some examples are provided. The explosive used in the MAHEM can be a truly insensitive explosive, e.g. TABT, resulting in invulnerability to accidental detonation.",

In addition, we will design the fusion system to be general enough to fuse any type of sensor data. The general objectives of the Phase I project are to lay down a foundation for developing a robust image-encoding scheme that will allow a neral network-based classifier to reliable distinguish getween various defect classes. We will also design a decision-level fusion methodology that is able to combine different forms of evidence relating to the nature of particular defects found in ordnance.",

This optical processing system is based on the Essex patented ImSyn(TM) processor which combines optical and digital integration to achieve high dynamic rnage. Tile proposed processor is based on a processing method that uses both phase and amplitude information to produce true complex transforms. Because the processor operates on complex data, improvements in pattern recognition performance may be achieved over traditional optical methods which use either amplitude-only or phase-only processing. The complete hybrid system can be manufactured in a small, low power, and lightweight package for use in automatic targeting of small munitions. The Phase I effort will be directed toward concept demonstration on a laboratory prototype system, development of a detailed design, and the preparation of a Phase II work plan. The Phase II effort will be to build and deliver an optical pattern recognition/optical correlation processor suitable for flight demonstration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Current helicopters use cam locking (friction type) over-running clutches to achieve a free wheeling behavior which is necessary in their dirve trains. These conventional over-running clutches tend to be rather large and heavy when designed to meet functional and flight safety requirements. Epilogics has developed a unique positive locking over-running clutch called Mechanical Diode (MD) which allows strong, light weight and extremely reliable designs with almost complete immunity to torsional vibration. One version of the over-running clutch is presently manufactured by Epilogics for autmotive racing applications where strength and durability are critically important. We expect to achieve a design which will be suitable for use between a helicopter engine and drive train. This over-running clutch will provide helicopter driveline manufacturers a lighter, stronger (per unit weight), more reliable and torsionally rigid alternative to the sprag and roller ramp devices presently in use.",

It was determined already that weaving is offering the best potential for resisting snow load due to the higher density and direction of the fiber alignment. Two basic types of curved tubular weaving were considered, a single shuttle flat loom and a multishuttle circular loom. After considerations, the circular loom was selected as the preffered method. The circular loom is of a very high production, and can be designed to accomodate an inner tube integrally during the weaving. The circular loom by definition working out if a creel warp, which makes it easy to weave a curved tube. A circular loom can also control the weft yarn rotation on its own axis precisely to prevent undesirable twisting of the weft if a tape shape yarn is woven.",

The benefit of this study is broad since the band structure of HgCdTe is similar to other III-V compounds among which there may also be a candidate material for this wavelength range. Modeling of laser performance with these quantized structures and improvement sin device processing and packaging techniques will lead to actual fabrication of the optimum laser design in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Infrared detectors have wide applications in missile guidance, surveillance and smart ammunition. Within the infrared spectrum, multi-color detection is highly desirable. Among the two color detectors, the ones with multi-spectral response and sharing the common optical area are of particular interest for military applications. The goal of this program is then to develop a technology to produce two color detectors, arrays and focal plane arrays. The final FPAs to be produced by the technology developed in this program will have a monolithic structure, a common sensing area and will be on silicon wafers. The infrared material will be HgCdTe grown by MOCVD method. In this phase I program period, HgCdTe multilayers consisting of MWIR and LWIR layers will first be produced. Subsequently, two color detectors will be fabricated in these materials by ion implementation and related processing steps. There are a number of two color detector types. By the end of this Phase I period, we will determine which type will be favored and be used in the Phase II program for producing FPAs. In the second phase of this program, multiplexers for operating two color detector arrays will be designed and fabricated. The HgCdTe two color detector arrays will be integrated to the multiplexers and then the final FPAs will be tested.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         There are three major issues about the semiconductor amplifiers design to be addressed here: 1. that the design meets the microwave applications' requirements in term of noise, bandwidth and dynamic range, 2. that it is compatible to integration with other opto-electronic components such as detectors, waveguides and lasers, and 3. that they are compatible to integration with current and future MMIC technology. A basic waveguide strucutre, common to lasers, detector and waveguide, is proposed here for optical amplifiers, integratible with MMICs. By choosing a common structure these components can be readily integrated together without the need for complicated multiple growth procedures and conflicting material and process requirements. The idea centers on the principle that the property of a gain medium can be manipulated by injection of carriers to vary its gain. Similarly, for an absorbing medium by adjusting its reverse bias voltage its absorption can be varied.",

BRAIDING CAN ACCOMMODATE LOCAL BUILD-UPS, PLY DROPOFFS, CONICAL SHAPES, AND QUICK ANGLE CHANGES. THE INTERLOCKING OF A BRAIDED STRUCTURE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE DAMAGE TOLERANCE. SIMPLE MODIFICATIONS TO BRAIDERS CAN ALLOW THE FORMATION OF FLAT FABRICS OR STRUCTURES AND THE FABRICATION OF TOROIDAL STRUCTURES IS POSSIBLE VIA SPLIT RING BRAIDING. THE FULL POTENTIAL OF BRAIDING AS A COMPOSITES MANUFACTURING PROCESS HAS NOT BEEN REALIZED. THIS IS MOSTLY DUE TO MACHINERY DESIGNED IN THE EARLY 1900S STILL BEING USED TODAY. PRIMITIVE CARRIER DESIGNS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE FIBERS SUCH AS HIGH MODULUS CARBON OR CERAMICS. THE NUMBER AND CAPACITY OF THE CARRIERS ALSO LIMITS THE SIZE OF THE STRUCTURE WHICH CAN BE BRAIDED EFFECTIVELY. FOSTER-MILLER PROPOSES TO DEVELOP NEW BRAIDING MACHINERY WHICH WILL PROVIDE TO BE EFFICIENT AND APPLICABLE TO A WIDE RANGE OF STRUCTURES NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE. WE WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS BY DEVELOPING AN ADVANCED BRAIDER CARRIER SYSTEM - A BREADBOARD MODEL OF WHICH WILL BE DEMONSTRATED IN PHASE I; AND BY APPLYING A MODULAR BRAIDER BASE CONCEPT THAT CAN BE ASSEMBLED INTO SEVERAL CONFIGURATIONS. DURING PHASE I WE WILL MEET WITH AIRFRAMERS TO DETERMINE COMPONENTS WHICH COULD BEST BENEFIT FROM AN ADVANCED BRAIDING SYSTEM. INITIAL CONTACTS HAVE BEEN MADE WITH SIKORSKY AIRCRAFT, BOEING HELICOPTERS, AND BELL HELICOPTERS TO SOLICIT TECHNICAL INPUT AND GUIDANCE FOR OUR PHASE I EFFORT. PHASE I EFFORTS WILL FEATURE AN ADVANCED BRAIDER CONCPET CAPABLE OF BRAIDING HIGH MODULUS FIBERS, TOW WIDTHS UP TO 1 IN.

Bacteriorhodopsin (BR) is the best candidate for SLM's because it exhibits picosecond response, high quantum yield, sensitivity to low light intensities, photochemical stability and broad wavelength response. Highly-oriented BR films of optical quality are needed, but not available. Foster-Miller will team with a biotech company to purify BR by removing carotenoids, ionic species and other impurities. Then we will combine sol-gel processing with our successful BR film electric field orientation process to produce optically clear, BR/sol-gel (BR/SiO2) nanocomposite films that contain highly-oriented BR molecules locked-in-placed within a matrix or rigid glass. Br/SiO2 films will be more transparent than Br films and will show better SLM response due to their higher BR purity, orientation and concentration. Our team includes renowned BR experts and Foster-Miller laser physicists who have already electro-deposited oriented BR films. In Phase I, we will prepare oriented BR/SiO2 films of high optical quality, demonstrate improved sensitivity and resolution and begin design of the BR-SLM device. In Phase II, we will fabricate a compatible, working BR-SLM for system testing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The composites industry has spent several years developing material systems for aircraft structure. Confidence has been built applying composites to such aircraft as the A6, V22, B2, and F22 Prototype. Now that composites materials have been proven the focus is shifted to obvious limitations in manufacturing technology. Significant weight reductions, cost savings, and performance enhancements can still be made by the development of advanced manufacturing technologies. A limiting factor for composites has been the issue of attachment. Most attachment schemes center about what is acceptable for metals. Taking advantage of the flexibility of composites can eliminate much of the demanding fastening requirements. Composite structure such as intersecting ribs and spars or frames and stringers is an excellent example. Current composites fuselage concepts have a stringer mousehole cut in a frame and/or use a combination of clips, doublers, rivets and bolts to assure attachment. This is a costly process that adds weight and increases manufacturing risk. Foster-Miller is proposing advanced braided performing technology which will produce continuous intersecting structure. In the case of a composite fuselage a continuous frame would be fabricated with continuous intersection spars. Fibers which make up the spar would be continuous through the frame eliminating the need for attachment at this critical location. In Phase I demonstration intersecting or cruciform structure will be fabricated. Several demonstration articles will be impregnated cured and tested to determine structural integrity. In addition enhanced quality functional deployment (EQFD), which integrates House of Quality methodology and Pugh concept analysis techniques will be employed to determine critical components for process automation. One determined component will be conceptualized, designed, fabricated and demonstrated.",

For this program, Foster-Miller proposes to exploit the unique properties of a new holographic film that can be reliably and repeatedly tuned with an applied voltage at millisecond speeds. The technique involves the combination of liquid crystals in a polymer holographic host. Using this composite a nurnber of optical interconnect components, active solar filters, and other optical and fiber optic devices have been previously tested. The goal of the Phase I effort will be to demonstrate wide band tuning over at least three wavelength regions with diffraction efficiencies approaching 99 percent and near zero optical throughput losses. Multiple holographic film elements will be scanned at rates exceeding 100 Hz. In Phase II we will demonstrate a prototype multiple filter unit to be tested under realistic conditions.

Ferrite pot cores have been used for increased coupling efficiency, but are undesirable for use in hard target penetrator weapons due to their brittleness. Recently, magnetic ordering phenomena have been observed in a number of organic systems. These ferromagnetic polymers would seem to be an ideal choice as a binder for ferrite powders; however, these materials have yet to reach their full potential as magnetic systems due to the fact that the science of synthesis and post-processing of these materials is still in its infancy. Most of the ferromagnetic polymers discovered thus far exhibit magnetic interactions along the polymer backbone only; however, three-dimensional order is necessary to obtain the bulk magnetic properties desired. The Foster-Miller approach will develop novel orientation techniques which will result in permanent three-dimensional alignment of magnetic domains in ferromagnetic polymers. By controlling the morphology and chemistry of the most advanced ferromagnetic polymers, Foster-Miller will achieve an order of magnitude improvement in magnetic properties. In Phase I, Foster-Miller will work with California Institute of Technology (Prof. Dougherty - inventor of organic ferromagnets), and DuPont (Joel Miller - inventor of room temperature organometallic magnetic materials) to impart morphology control to most advanced ferromagnetic polymers to achieve lOX improvement in magnetic properties. In Phase II, we will team with KDI (a fuze manufacturer) to demonstrate a mechanically robust fuze with excellent magnetic properties.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The AVLB is a combat system employed in the assault phase of land operations to provide a means for rapid narrow gap crossing. This mission dictates that the AVLB often leads the way and hence can be subject to direct and indirect enemy fire. This fact suggests the minimization or total removal of the crew from this vehicle and the development of a remote operation system for it. The data required by the operator to ensure a successful bridge deployment is immense, including vehicle and AVLB status, vehicle location and orientation relative to the gap and gap profile. However, as the bandwidth of the operational radio fit of these vehicles precludes the use of standard video based remote control systems, a non-video based system must be developed. Foster-Miller proposes an animated graphics based remote control display system which minimizes the operator data overload possibilities by automating as many control functions as possible. This automation will minimize data flow rates and improve the efficiency of the operator in his primary role - providing a bridge for the assault forces to cross. Foster-Miller also offers an optional development of a near real-time \"snapshot still video\" as a means to enhance operator virtual presence at the bridging site.",

Therefore, it is necessary to monitor in real-time the integrity of critical composite components during the manufacturing processes. Accomplishing this task (producing high quality/reliable components) will reduce/eliminate the in-service catastrophic failures of the components. Additionally, manufacturing expendatures will be reduced due to a reduction in scrapped components and waste time and energy. Foster-Miller proposes a novel system consisting of advanced NDE sensors and related software to develop an \"expert\" manufacturing process. The concept employs magnetostrictive particles (sensors) embedded in a composite to detect the changes in magnetic signatures associated with the stress fields due to voids, cracks, holes, delaminations and thickness variations. Magnetic detectors can be used to monitor the magnetic signatures. In addition to the NDE sensors Foster-Miller will develop algorithms to collect, record, store and interpret the sensor signals. An \"expert\" system will be developed to make \"expert\" changes to the manufacturing process to increase product quality and reliability based on the sensor data. In summary, the Army will have developed an advanced technique to improve the quality and reliability of critical equipment such as composite gun barrels now under investigation; composite armor and outer skins on tanks and personnel carriers; and composite rotor blades on helicopters. Additionally, the Army will realize a savings on equipment acquisition due to reduced manufacturing costs.",

In addition, the successful PMB material will not damage substrate surfaces, will have a long product life, will be biodegradable, and available in large quantities at competitive costs.

We will review four development options: BPMBs made from an all-biodegradable polymer, copolymerization of biodegradable polymers, physical blends of two or more biodegradable polymers, and biodegradable polymers filled with inclusions of various hardnesses. We will select the most promising option and materials to compound and mold into test coupons and grind into blast media. The coupons will be tested for mechanical properties including toughness and hardness. The blast media will be analyzed for biodegradability and stripping efficiency. The outcome of these tests will be used to establish the economics of the BPMB system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Development of the capability to predict flow fields around naval ships,submarines in particular, both accurately and efficiently is crucial to the Navy in the design of naval ships. State-of-the-art Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solvers are capable of predicting the general flow field a=out an appended submarine , but there are two major shortcomings: the long computing time required and the lack of resolution of the vortical flows generated in junctures and appendage tips of the sulxnarine. The multilevel adaptive method can overcome these two shortcomings by improving the rate of convergence of the solver by an order of magnitude,therefore significantly reducing ccmputing time, and by placing denser grid distributions strategically in regions where the vortical flow dominates, ermbling accurate resolution of the vortical flow. The implementation of the multilevel adaptive methods with an existing 3-D Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solver, such that the vortical flows generated by appended submarines can be both accurately and efficiently predicted, is the main goal of the proposed Phase I project. The improvement and the development of more accurate and efficient numerical schemes is the goal of the Phase II project.",

THE INCREASE IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY COMPARED TO CAPACITOR-PLATE DEVICES IS GREAT ENOUGH THAT THE INITIAL COST OF OUR PROPOSED DRYER WILL BE RECOVERED IN JUST A FEW YEARS DUE TO THE SAVINGS IN ELECTRIC POWER CONSUMPTION. BASED UPON RESEARCH RESULTS, WOOD QUALITY RESULTING FROM RADIO-FREQUENCY VACUUM DRYING IS EQUAL TO THE QUALITY OF WOOD DRIED BY CONVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES, EXCEPT THAT DRYING OCCURS MORE THAN 17 TIMES FASTER. SINCE CONVENTIONAL DRYING IS A SLOW PROCESS, SUBSTANTIAL REVENUES ARE LOST DUE TO LARGE INVENTORIES OF WOOD THAT ARE TIED UP DURING PROCESSING. THIS MONETARY LOSS CAN BE AVOIDED USING RAPID RADIO-FREQUENCY VACUUM DRYING, MAKING THE PROCESS COMPETITIVE WITH CONVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES.

NEUTRAL ANALOGS ARE OF SPECIAL INTEREST BECAUSE OF THEIR POSSIBLE ABILITY TO PENETRATE INTO CELLS BY PASSIVE DIFFUSION. THIS RESEARCH HAS TWO ASPECTS. THE FIRST ASPECT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF SYNTHETIC METHODS FOR THE FACILE SYNTHESIS OF DEOXYOLOGONUCLEOTIDE ANALOGS BEARING A NEW NEUTRAL, ACHRIAL AND STABLE INTERNUCLEOTIDE ANALOG LINKAGE - NAMELY, FORMACETAL. SYNTHETIC METHODS WILL BE USED FOR THE IMPROVED SYNTHESIS OF FORMACETALS. PROMISING CHEMISTRIES WILL BE ADAPTED TO POLYMER BOUND SYNTHESIS. THE SECOND ASPECT FOCUSES ON THE IN VITRO HYBRIDIZATION OF THESE MODIFIED ANALOGS TOWARD COMPLEMENTARY RNA AND THEIR TRIPLEX FORMATION ABILITY WITH DUPLEX DNA. THE RNA INTERACTION WILL BE STUDIED BY CLASSICAL THERMAL DENATURATION EXPERIMENTS AND A NEW KINETIC ASSAY DESCRIBED IN THE PRELIMINARY DATA.

RESEARCHERS HAVE DEPOSITED THE C70 LAYER WITH AN ION CLUSTER BEAM DEPOSITION PROCESS AND ACTIVATED THE LAYER WITH A MICROWAVE PLASMA METHOD. ENHANCED NUCLEATION OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR ENHACED GROWTH OF SUPERIOR ULTRATHIN DIAMOND COATINGS WITH A FINE-GRAIN STRUCTURE, WHICH ARE OF INTEREST FOR MANY APPLICATIONS REQUIRING EXCEPTIONAL MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND CHEMICAL INERTNESS. RECENTLY, DEVELOPMENT BY GINER, INC. WITH BORON-DOPED CONDUCTIVE DIAMOND FILMS HAS EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF DIAMOND-FILM TECHNOLOGY. WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE AN ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC, SCALABLE METHOD FOR DEPOSITING A THIN C70 LAYER BY A SOLUTION-CASTING TECHNIQUES, FOLLOWED BY ELECTROCHEMICAL ACTIVITION OF THE C70. WE WILL INVESTIGATE THIS NOVEL DEPOSITION AND ACTIVATION METHOD FOR ENHANCING THE GROWTH OF CONDUCTIVE DIAMOND FILMS ON SELECT CONDUCTIVE SUBSTRATES. DURING PHASE I, WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE NATURE OF THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE OF THE ELECTROCHEMICALLY ACTIVATED C70 LAYERS AND CORRELATE THE MORPHOLOGY TO THE PROPERTIES OF THE CONDUCTIVE DIAMOND LAYER. FORMATION OF SUPERIOR, PORE-FREE ULTRATHIN CONDUCTIVE DIAMOND FILMS WILL BE DEMONSTRATED THROUGH MEASUREMENT OF SURFACE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND CORROSION RESISTANCE. FOLLOWING TESTING, ANY CHANGES IN FILM PROPERTIES WILL BE DETERMINED. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: FULLERENE-BASED, CONDUCTIVE DIAMOND FILMS ARE EXPECTED TO FIND APPLICATIONS IN MANY ELECTROLYTIC CELLS, ELECTRODES, AND AS BIPOLAR PLATES FOR LOW-TEMPERATURE (80-200OC) FUEL CELL SYSTEMS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         An intelligent nonlinear control methodology, based on an innovative combination of feedback linearization and artificial neural networks, is to be adapted to control remotely piloted helicopters. A mapping is derived which transforms a nonlinear dynamic model of the plant into a linear, time invariant space. A single point linear controller design is then carried out in this linear space. The derived control is then mapped back into the nonlinear space using an inverse transformation. An artifical neural network can be trained prior to flight to realize the inverse mapping in real time. A second network can be trained in flight to learn, and correct for, the vehicle characteristics not captured in the dynaic model used to derive the control. The feasibility and value of this approach is to be demonstrated by evaluation of a controller design for the current US Army/NASA X-Cell model-scale helicopter using a high fidelity dynamic simulation. The design will include optional position feedback loops which can be used to track a prescribed trajectory. Once the computational burden of the control algorithm has been quantified, conceptual design of flight worthy hardware will begin. Detailed design, construction, test and evaluation will be carried out in Phase II.",

SENSITIVE ANALYTICAL METHODS ARE NEEDED FOR ESTABLISHING THE PROPER DOSING REGIMENS IN THESE STUDIES AND FOR MAXIMIZING YIELDS DURING THE LARGE SCALE ISOLATION OF THESE SCARCE NATURAL PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, THE AVAILABLIITY OF BRYOSTATIN IMMUNOASSAYS WOULD FACILITATE BASIC RESEARCH EFFORTS TO DETERMINE THE BIODYNTHESIS AND ACTUAL SOURCE OF THESE INTERESTING COMPOUNDS. WE PLAN TO SYNTHESIZE WILL CHARACTERIZED BRYOSTATIN IMMUNOGENS WHICH SHOULD ELICIT ANTIBODY RESPONSES IN RABBITS AND MICE. THE GOAL OF PHASE I RESEARCH WILL BE TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCING BRYOSTATIN IMMUNOASSAYS UTILIZING POLYCLONAL RABBIT ANTIBODIES.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The goal of the proposed research effort is to develop a cost-effective system capable of measuring leakage into gas masks being worn by Navy personnel. The ability to measure gas mask leak rates will greatly enhance chemical warfare training effectiveness, thereby increasing the level of protection that gas masks provide. The proposed system will also provide a sound basis for proper gas mask selection and issue. A new method for measuring leakage rates into industrial respirators has been developed. The method employs a controlled negative pressure (CNP) technique to eliminate many of the problems associated with systems based on the use of aerosol challenge agents, and is significantly faster and more precise. The objectives for Phase I are to conduct a comprehensive review of technologies that can be applied to the mask leak measurement problem. A specific set of criteria will be used to analyze advantages and limitations of each identified technology relative to the CNP concept. Information needed to define an acceptable leak criterion for gas masks will also be identified during Phase I. The product of Phase I research will provide a comprehensive basis for evaluating and selecting the most cost-effective system for measuring gas mask leakage.",

THIS SHORT-TERM TOXICITY MANIFESTS AS LOW CLONING EFFICIENCIES. INHIBITORS OF PLASMA AMINE OXIDASES PREVENT THESE TOXIC EFFECTS AND INCREASE CLONING EFFICIENCIES FOR MURINE CFU-ERYTHROID AND CFU-GRANULOCYTE/MACROPHAGE. THESE INHIBITORS CAN SUBSTITUTE FOR 2-MERCAPTOETHANOL IN THE CFU-E ASSAY, PROVIDING AN EXPLANATION FOR THE STIMULATORY EFFECTS OF THIOLS ORIGINALLY DISCOVERED BY ISCOVE. HOWEVER, THESE ENZYME INHIBITORS ARE TOXIC TO HUMAN CELLS, SO OTHER APPROACHES ARE NEEDED TO ELIMINATE AMINE OXIDASE TOXICITY. SERUM-FREE MEDIA DO NOT NECESSARILY CIRCUMVENT THIS PROBLEM, BECAUSE MANY \"PURIFIED\" PROTEINS OR ADDITIVES REQUIRED FOR THESE MEDIA CONTAIN AMINE OXIDASES AS CONTAMINANTS. THESE ENZYMES ALSO CAUSE LONG-TERM TOXICITY, SUCH AS THE CRISIS OF SPONTANEOUS TRANSFORMATION IN CULTURES OF MOUSE EMBRYO CELLS.

IN PHASE I, WE WILL DETERMINE WHICH PLASMA AMINE OXIDASES CAUSE TOXICITY. IN PHASE II, WE WILL DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY TO ELIMINATE DELETERIOUS AMINE OXIDASES FROM THE CULTURE SUPPLEMENTS, CONFIRM THAT THEIR ELIMINATION PREVENTS SHORT- AND LONG-TERM TOXICITIES, AND APPLY THIS NEW CELL CULTURE TECHNOLOGY TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF STEM CELL LINES FROM NORMAL AND MALIGNANT HUMAN BONE MARROW, BREAST, PROSTATE, AND LYMPH NODE, INCLUDING LYMPHOMAS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         With the advent of cytokine therapy, thrombocytopenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity of anti-cancer and anti-AIDS drugs. Early screening of developmental agents for toxicity to hematopoietic, particularly megakaryocytic, progenitors would allow the selection of drugs that are effective against tumor or virus, but are not toxic. Current clonogenic assays for human megakaryocyte progenitors (CFU-Meg) are hampered by a non-specific staining procedure and a requirement for human AB plasma. We will attempt, firstly, changes in the staining methodology and secondly, development of serum- and protein-free conditions. Serum-and protein-free assays can better model in vivo conditions by addition of physiological concentrations of human drug-binding proteins (i. e., human albumin, y-globulin, etc.). An alternative to clonogenic assays will also be investigated. This approach will use flow cytometry to measure changes in the total number of megakaryocytes growing in liquid culture. The use of flow cytometry to measure progenitor differentiation would be of significant advantage over traditional clonogenic assays because of the simple labeling procedures, thequantitative and objective nature of the measurement and the potential for obtaining results sooner the 12-14 days required for a human CFU-Meg assay. Simple, standardized assays for human megakaryocyte progenitors may assist physicians in determining the number of progenitors necessary for successful bone marrow and/or peripheral blood transplants.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In Phase I of DARP MIMIC program, Hittite Microwave Corporation, in co-operation with Harry Diamond Laboratories, has developed a GaAs MMIC chip which performs complete RF functions of an FM-CW radar designed for proximity fuze applications in Army's Multi-Option Fuze for Artillery (MOFA). The RF package for this fuze is a miniature IC package measuring .25\" x .25\" x .09\". The RF assembly integrated with a single-patch antenna is about the size of a five-cent coin. This MMIC radar consumes .9 to 1.25 watts of DC power. In Phase 2 of the MIMIC program, Hittite has a task of developing a smaller and lower-cost chip which consumes much less DC power for fuzing applications in small munitions. MMIC processes based on enhancement/depletion-mode MESFET and hetero-junction bipolar transistor (HBT) devices are becoming available as stabilized production processes. These new device technologies will be utilized to develop lower cost, less power hungry radar MMIC with added performance capabilities. In addition to the basic radar function, the new radar chips to be developed in this program will incorporate ECM-resistance and HPM protection capabilities. The MMIC functions to be developed for these added capabilities are: advanced modulation and demodulation circuits and self-activated switch/attenuator used as a limiter. The proposed Phase I study will lead to design, simulation, performance analysis, and preliminary layout of the low-cost, low-power MMIC radar chip with added jam/burn-out resistance capabilities.",

RECENT TECHNIQUES FOR SILICON AND BURIED OXIDE DEFECT DENSITY MEASUREMENTS SHOW THAT FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS ARE NECESSARY TO ASSURE ADVANCED CIRCUIT YIELDS. THE EXPERIMENTS PLANNED FOR THIS PROGRAM CAPITABLIZE ON THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY TOTALLY INDEPENDENT CONTROL OF OXYGEN ION BEAM CURRENT PARAMETERS AND WAFER TEMPERATURE DURING IMPLANATATIN. THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED TO OPTIMIZE IMPLANT PARAMETERS FOR REDUCED SILICON AND BURIED OXIDE DEFECTS. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS PREDICTED TO RESULT IN THE IMPROVED CAPABILITY OF ADVANCED CIRCUITRY SYSTEMS FOR THE ABOVE FIELD APPLICATIONS.",

THIS PROJECT WILL COMPARE THE JC PROPERTIES OF INTERNAL-TIN NB3SN MADE FROM A MATRIX CONTAINING A SMALL QUANTITY OF GERMANIUM WITH THOSE FROM A MATERIAL WITH A PURE COPPER MATRIX. SINCE THE PRINCIPAL NEED IS TO INCREASE THE JC IN THE HIGHER FIELD REGION, THE EFFECT ON MATERIAL WITH NB 7.5 WEIGHT % TANTALUM (TA) AND NB 1 WEIGHT % TA AS WELL AS PURE NB FILAMENTS WILL BE EXAMINED. IN PHASE I, TRIAL BILLETS WILL BE PREPARED FROM MATERIAL WITH A PURE COPPER MATRIX TO PROVIDE BASELINE COMPARISONS. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATION WILL BE CARRIED OUT ON BILLETS WITH COPPER GERMANIUM MATRICES AND THE THREE FILAMENT COMPOSITIONS MENTIONED ABOVE. THE RATE OF STRAIN HARDENING OF ALLOYED MATRICES IS EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER THAN THAT OF PURE COPPER AND, IN THE PAST, PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED WHEN ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO COLD BOND HARD SUBELEMENTS IN THE TIN-CORE PROCESS. THE TUBULAR-TIN-SOURCE (TTS) PROCESS, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE FAR LESS SENSITIVE TO THE HARDNESS OF THE MATRIX WHEN A HOT ISOSTATIC PRESSING STEP IS USED IN THE PROCESSING OF THE CORE.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Stirling Power systems have the potential to provide enabling technology for solar system exploration space science missions because of their relatively high efficiency and low mass. There is a need for a 2 watt electrical output power source for Martian weather stations and other applications. Radioisotopes are the only feasible heat source. The General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) is oversized because its minimal output is 250 thermal watts. The Radioisotope Heating Unit (RHU) supplies 1.1 thermal watts for heating of electronics, and is capable of operation at 500 degrees C. This heat source temperature is well-suited for small power level stirling engines; the number of RHUs needed depends on the desired output power. Stirling Technology (STC) proposes to design a Stirling power converter with an output of two electrical watts. The innovative work is based on 5 watt and 11.7 watt output engines previously developed at STC, but requires novel displacer support and alternator configuration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In 1984, the United States had the lowest tuberculosis infection rate in modern history. In 1985, TB incidence started rising and has continued to rise. Additionally, TB resistance to drugs has increased, from 10 percent in the early 1980's to 23 percent in 1991 for one standard drug and from 3 percent to 7 percent for multi-drug-resistant TB. Current identification procedures utilize growth and enzymatic tests to distinguish between bacterial genera and species. These tests can add several weeks of uncertainty onto the time needed to culture colonies to testable sizes and fully identify the microbial species when tuberculosis related. This delay may be crucial for treatment regimens needed for drug resistant strains. Mycolic acids in the cell walls of mycobacteria have been shown to be indicative of individual species. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is a useful analytical method for obtaining distinct chromatographic patterns of these acids. Pattern recognition methods have been applied to develop 100% accurate classification models for 188 samples of 8 mycobacteria species. We propose to extend these models to identify 36 species. Preliminary indications are that this approach is as fast as genetic probes after colony growth at 1/4 of the cost, or less.",

Due to the inherent side-effects of sedative-hyponotics there are many times when they cannot be used such as in-flight sleep during long hauls. Recently, significant strides may have been made in the nonpharmacological treatment of insominia that may be of use in inducing and maintaining higher quality sleep than might otherwise be obtained under common stressful or adverse military conditions. Phase I will measure the quality and quantity of sleep obtained by crew chiefs on KC-10 aircraft via Medilog recordings. Actilume data will be obtained for the might preceeding the mission through three nights post completion and sleep logs will be kept. Crew chiefs will undergo three different prototype \"sleep training\" regimes using nonpharmacological insomnia treatment techniques including a new 3-D \"Virtual Reality\" audio technology delivered via ordinary tapeplayer and headphones. A repeated measures design using the same Medilog/Actilume protocol will evaluate effectiveness both on in-flight sleep and potential impact on sleep disrupted by circadian dysrhythn associated with long distance transmeridian flight.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this proposal is to develop an ultrasonic technique for the measurement of the thickness of thin films in an integrated circuit manufacturing environment. Our approach is to use ultrasound in the regime where the wavelength is comparable to that of light; that is in the frequency range of 1-10 GHz. In this range, it will be possible to measure the thickness of very thin and opaque films. Also, because the mechanical impedances of materials vary significantly more than their dielectric constants, we expect to be able to measure the individual thicknesses of layered thin films. An XY scan will be made to generate film thickness contour map of the wafer. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: This project will demonstrate the feasbility of a technique which can be developed into a commercial thin/thick film thickness measurement system. Economical, quantitative, simple, inexpensive, and nonrestrictive measurements of the thickness of transparent and opaque, simple and multiple films, will have a great impact on the cost and quality control of thin film deposition in an integrated circuits manufacturing environment.",

THEGEOLOGICAL PARAMETERS LEADING TO SUCCESSFUL OHC WELLS HAVE BEEN INADEQUATELY STUDIED FOR PREDICTABILITY USING THE OHC TECHNIQUE OUTSIDE OF THE EXISTING CAVITY FAIRWAY. THE PLANNED RESEARCH IS DIRECTED TOWARDS RESOLVING THE GEOLOGIC SYSTEMS FAVORABLE TO ACHIEVING CAVITATION WITH INITIAL HIGH GAS RATES. PRELIMINAY PRODUCTION MAPPING SUGGESTSTHE CAVITATION FAIRWAY IS CHARACTERIZED BY A NORTHWEST TREND EXTENSIONAL FRACTURED ZONE WHICH HAS INTERSECTED COAL RESERVOIRS AT FULL ADSORPTIVE CAPACITY WITH FREE GAS IN THE FRACTURES.

THE PROBLEM IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE SENSOR INFORMATION HAS SIGNIFICANCE UNCERTAINTY AND NOISE DUE TO THE PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS OF THE SENSORS, COUNTERMEASURES, AND IN SOME BATTLE SCENARIOS, NUCLEAR EFFECTS. CONVENTIONAL OPTIMIXATION TECHNIQUES ARE TOO SLOW FOR THE COMMAND CENTER NEEDS, DO NOT YIELD GOOD RESULTS IN THE PRESENCE OF UNCERTAIN AND NOISY DATA, AND ARE BRITTLE IN THE PRESENCE OF UNANTICIPATED SITUATIONS. SDIO BATTLE MANAGEMENT THEN BECOMES ONE OF NOT A MATHEMATICAL OPTIMIZATION, BUT ONE OF HEURISTIC REASONING, REASONING UNDER UNCERTAINTY, AND \"RULES OF THUMB.\" THE PROBLEM DOMAIN APPROACHES THAT OF \"DETERMINISTIC CHAOS\" WHERE A VERY SMALL CHANGE IN SOME PARAMETER MAY MAKE A MUCH LARGER CHANGE IN THE OUTCOME. THIS PROPOSAL DETAILS HOW WE WILL USE \"AUTONOMOUS AGENTS\" TO MODEL THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS WITHIN A BATTLE SITUATION, AND THEN USE THESE AUTONOMOUS AGEMTS TO EITHER GENERATE NEAR OPTIMAL BATTLE STRATEGY, OR PROVIDE DECISION AIDS TO AN OPERATOR.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Intelligent Reasoning Systems (IRS) is developing an integrated active vision system (AVS) based on design principles derived from experimental analysis of mammalian visual systems. The AVS design is based on a asynchronous analog encoding of location and motion data, and a custom VLSI Hybrid Temporal Processing Element (HTPE) develped by and available soley to IRS (patent pending). The HPTE can operate on analog data at frequencies in excess of 100 MHz, allowing rapid oversampling methods to be used for resolution enhancement, motion detection, and multiple-template matching. HTPEs have low device count and power dissipation, and can be fabricated in small layout areas. The AVS is intended for eventual on-board application in robots, intelligent machine tools, and other autonomous sensory-motor systems that require visible, IR, or similar input. The initial step in visual processing is the collection of data from the primary sensor. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to evaluate the feasibility of a silicon retina for the AVS based on the HTPE,and to investigate various methods for achieving sub-pixel resolution and enhance motion sensitivity with such a retina.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The aim of the proposed multi-phase program is to develop and commercialize MEMCAD, a family of computer-aided design (CAD) tools to assist in the design and manufacture of microelectromechanical (MEM) structures. MEMCAD tools should drastically reduce the development time and cost for MEM devices, resulting in more devices being available at lower prices. Developers of MEM devices such as microsensors and microactuators rely on trial-and-error methods in laboratories to develop new devices. This significant cost of prototype development is now reflected in the high prices which the Navy and others must pay for these devices. MEMCAD integrates simulators, databases, and solid modeling tools into a system which mimics the fabrication and performance of microstructures, allowing a desinger to conceptualize, simulate, and iterate the micromachining fabrication process on a workstation, thus making MEM devices more affordable. The first prototype of the MEMCAD family of tools, referred to as MEMCAD_p (MEMCAD for pressure sensors), is expected to provide the core technology for the development of additional MEMCAD tools for other sensors and microstructures, including eventually integrated circuits.",

IN PHASE I, THE MAIN GOAL IS TO LEARN HOW TO OVERCOME THIS BY USING INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE TECHNIQUES. INVESTIGATORS WILL STUDY COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC DOMAIN SOFTWARE SYSTEMS TO SEE IF ONE OR MORE OF THEM COULD BE MODIFIED IN ACCESS CD-ROM BASED MICRODATA FILES QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY. IDD WILL CREATE A PARTIAL PROTOTYPE SYSTEM THAT WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP BASELINE DATA ON ACCESS TIMES USING DIFFERENT ACCESS METHODS. THIS DATA WILL FORM THE BASIS FOR THE DESIGN OF A CD-ROM MICRODATA PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR PHASE II IMPLEMENTATION. THE PHASE I TARGET TEST FILES WILL BE SELECTED FROM SOME OF THE CENSUS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA SAMPLES (PUMS). PUMS WILL SOON EXIST FOR MOST DECADES SINCE 1880. IN ADDITION THERE ARE MANY OTHER LARGE MICRODATA FILE SERIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO INVESTIGATORS IN DEMOGRAPHY, EPIDEMIOLOGY, HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER HEALTH-RELATED FIELDS. WORK IN PHASE II WILL DEVELOP A LIBRARY OF CD-ROM MICRODATA VOLUMES FOR SALE AS A PHASE III COMMERCIAL VENTURE.",

THE FIRST ONE INVOLVES GUIDED WAVES TRAVELLING ALONG THE INTERFACE; THE EFFECT OF BONDING INTIMACY WILL BE MEASURED USING THE VELOCITY AND THE ATTENTUATION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ULTRASONIC WAVE. THE SECOND METHOD USES ULTRASONIC WAVES WHICH ARE NORMALLY INCIDENT TO THE BONDPLANE; THE FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE REFLECTION/TRANSMISSION COEFFICIENTS AT THE BONDPLANE WILL BE USED.

SCHOOLS WAIT FOR DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH QUALITY COURSE MATERIALS; AUTHORS, SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS, AND PUBLISHERS WAIT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF COURSES. RESEARCHERS PROPOSE TO BREAK THIS GRIDLOCK BY DEVELOPING NEW COURSE MATERIALS AND STATE-OF-THE-ART COMPUTER SOFTWARE BASED ON THE BEST CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF STUDENTS' CONCEPTIONS OF PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS. THE SOFTWARE, PROVISIONALLY NAMED STOCHASTICSLAB, IS A COMPUTER LEARNING ENVIRONMENT THAT INTEGRATES SIMULATION, DATA GATHERING, DATA DISPLAY, EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS, AND STATISTICAL INFERENCING CAPABILITIES. EMPHASIS IS ON ILLUMINATING THE INNER WORKINGS OF STATISTICAL AND PROBABILISTIC PROCESSES. THE ENVIRONMENT PROMOTES INVESTIGATION AND EXPLORATION BY ALLOWING OBJECTS SUCH AS SPINNERS, GRAPHS, AND STATISTICAL MEASUREMENT TOOLS TO BE LINKED TOGETHER BY STUDENTS AND TEACHERS TO CREATE DYNAMIC MICRO WORLDS.

THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUES ARE BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF MICROWAVE DYNAMIC DIELECTRIC ANALYSIS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Data links are considered to be of major importance for the Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) in its role as a reconnaissance/surveillance platform. Secure, reliable and timely data communication will increase the acceptance of UAVs in the military community. The large amount of communication data needed for video images together with jamming-resistant overhead techniques may not permit timely transmission of images. Thus data compression techniques are needed. This proposal intends to investigate a data compression concept named Walsh Neural Network Unmanned Vehicle Image Transmission (WALNUT) based on vector quantization techniques. Vector quantization (VQ) is emerging as a leading and powerful data compression technique because of its ability to utilize peraceptually meaningful nonlinear correlation techniques. Competitive learning based on neural network (NN) technology applied to VQ brings effective adaptation to motion and scene changes and superior performance needed for near real time compression of image sequences obtained from UAVs operating in a military environment. Such a system has the potential of providing: (1) Economical quantization of pixel information, (2) fast compression and expansion techniques, and (3) protection against channel noise and jamming. In addition VQ with NN learning also inherently maps into parallel computing design makeing possible an even greater data communication speedup.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Currently, there exist no pressure sensors which are able to withstand operating temperatures in excess of 500 degrees Celsius. Such pressure measurements are critical for proper control of operating parameters in aeronautical propulsion systems, rockets and materials processing. Silicon pressure transducers, which have found extensive use in the aerospace industry, are inoperative above 600 degrees Celsius due to the unstable mechanical properties of silicon at those temperatures, and are unable to monitor pressure in the hot sections of aircraft engines. We, at Kulite, have initiated a program to develop ultra-high temperature pressure transducers using high temperature semiconductors, namely SiC and Diamond, as sensing elements. The program involves characterization of the materials, development of processing methods and most importantly, the demonstration of a prototype sensor capable of operation at temperatures up to 800 degrees Celsius. These transducers will revolutionize aerospace measurement capability by facilitating proper engine monitoring, enhanced fuel efficiency, and safety.",

The simplest system configuration includes a qrowth chamber, a sample transfer chamber which holds the central distribution sample handling device, and a surface analysis chamber. Full system integration in terms of mechanical design and sample transfer efficiency will be assured through expert design and engineering.",

KVH proposes to test and characterize the NWC Hall Effect Breadboard and to generate a packaging feasibility study. KVH will use unique, proprietary capabilities, including a free standing Triaxial Helmholtz Cage to evaluate the NWC concept. KVH will use the analysis results to formulate a packaging concept for the Hall Effect Device in accordance with predetermined DTC objectives. The results will also be applied to a concept refinement which will include investigation of implementing compensation capability and analysis of accessing, or incorporating, vertical reference data. Compensation capability will allow the Hall Effect device to achieve 0.50 installed accuracy. The implementation of vertical reference data will enable the unit to be used as a compass, significantly increasing its marketing potential. KVH will perform a preliminary market analysis to quantify the volume potential for the modified design.

Because these methodologies exploit a priori knowledge of a limited number of target models, while allowing the targets to be oriented towards the viewer in any arbitrary fashion, they result in a powerful ATR system. The central focus of this proposal is on building an automatic target recognition system for identifying mobile targets using an object-image alignment approach. Using this approach, we propose to develop a two stage recognition algorithm. The first stage of this algorithm makes use of the three-point object-image correspondence theorim of Huttenlocher and Ullman (1990) to narrow the search for constrained matching of object-image pairs. The second stage of the algorithm uses the mean-field annealing techique to compute the object-image transformation parameters from multiple matches by minimizing a least-squares measure. For segmentation of the target from its background, we employ a motion-based segmentation algorithm developed earlier by LNK.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Due to the enhanced differential quantum efficiency, high differential gain and potential low laser relative intensity noise of strained Quantum Well (QW) lasers, there is a significant opportunity to develop fiber optic links that employ QW lasers which may exceed the current link loss and noise figure performance of bulk laser based links. While high speed (>20GHz) strained layer QW lasers operating at short wavelengths have been demonstrated, no QW devices have yet been made that operate above l7GHz at l.3um or l.5um wavelength. This program will investigate the feasibility of developing, packaging and characterizing long wavelength (l.3um and l.5um) 25GHz modulaton bandwidth strained QW lasers for microwave and millimeterwave transmission applications. In particular, the effort will use existing QW material and laser structure models to optimize the modulation bandwidth of lasers that employ innovative InGaAs(P)/InP and InGaAlAs QW material systems. Furthermore, we will evaluate our existing laser packaging up to 25GHz and determine if improvements are required to realize the potential bandwidth of the new laser structure in a commercial microwave fiber optic transmitter/link.",

The long-term objective is to develop a \"headtracker' component for people with motor disabilities whose eyes are difficult to track because they have limited control of head motion. The aim of Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of tracking a wide range of erratic head motion, in real time, with a video camera. The methodology will be to write image-processing, video-control algorithms and software and to demonstrate effective software and hardware operation on a breadboard system. Phase I research will provide the technical basis for the commercial development of an innovative rehabilitation technology. It will lead to a unique, user-friendly system interface and remove any burden on the user for special head positioning. The availability of a headtracker will greatly expand the market for eye-controlled computers. The expansion of this market will be useful for people with a variety of disabilities resulting from cerebral palsy, high spinal cord injuries, head injuries, strokes, and other neurologic disorders.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of the Phase I program is a design of a stereoscopic and binaural telepresence system for remote piloting of the FFRRV helicopter. The system must afford the pilot on the ground a sense of \"presence\" in the cockpit - both visually and aurally - complete enough to permit aggressive and precise manuevers. LEEP Systems will design a system based on its present technology, having a very wide angle of view for fast and accurate orientation in space as well as high resolution inserts for sharp views of distant features of the terrain. By this means the benefits of high resolution and wide angle can be simultaneously realized by just doubling the video bandwidth and of the electronic hardware, whereas without the inserts, getting vision substantially better than legal blindness requires unavailable components and a one hundred-fold increase in video bandwidth, which is not feasible. Along with AACOM Data Links, major consultants for telemetry equipment, LEEP brings to this task a unique breadth of experience and depth of skill, which is quite adequate to the task, as demonstrated repeatedly by innovations and by directly related products brought successfully to market. The anticipated work load will be readily accommodated.",

This will include evaluating and testing alternative sandwich structure from the standpoint of weight, cost, producibility, and suitability. The goal is to recommend 2-3 combinations of face sheet, core and adhesive for Phase II Component testing which will meet or exceed the criteria for moisture and damage tolerance. The evaluation and testing process will center on two dominant problems: (1) moisture intrusion and retention and (2) low velocity impact damage. Leonard Associates will use a unique approach to characterizing core, face sheet, an adhesive separately to determine their tolerances before testinsg them in combination. By testinsg and evaluating individual performance, Leonard Associates will seek to discover the most effective synergistic combination to resist moisture ingression and absorption and maximize resistance to low velocity impact damage. Since much technical data on the materials is available through government and industry, only a minimum of coupon testing will be performed in Phase I. Leonard Associates will use an extensive group of supporting technical specialists available at L.A.I.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The study of a method of imaging through thick turbulent layers using extended sources is proposed. The method uses the technique of phase diversity to generate multiple images of the source in multiple focal planes. A parametric description of the turbulent distortion and the source is found by a multidimensional fit of the data to a model of the turbulent distortion and the extended source. The phase diversity method simultaneously solves for the phase distortion (as a function of look angle) and the source distribution. In addition to the estimate of the source, the informatin can be fed back into an adaptive optics control system. The phase distortion can be parameterized in the pupil plane as a function of look angle or in a layered model where the layers sit at different distances from the pupil. Either model lends itself to estimation of the correcting phase to be applied at each element of a multi-conjugate adaptive optics system that corrects for anisoplanatic distortion. This method has application to imaging systems with synthetic beacons and passive systems that only use ambient light.",

The excellent cycle life and specific energy (e.g. 200 deep cycles at 165 Whr/Kg), wide operating temperature range, low self-discharge rate and ruggedness make the Li/CuCl*2* system particularly attractive for such an application. The approach in Phase I will be to characterize the low temperature 1.1 mA/cm^2 continuous discharge and 10-50 mA/cm^2 pulse discharge performance of 80 mAhr size laboratory cells at 23, -20 and -55 degrees C and then to evaluate the performance again after a number of innovative improvements to the positive electrode, electrolyte and cell design. Innovations that will receive particular emphasis will include reducing the particle size of the positive electrode active materials and conductive additives, modifying the crystal structure or purity of the active material and changing the electrolyte salt and adding volatile cosolvents. The construction and testing of rechargeable cells with 7.6 cm diameter bipolar electrodes will be undertaken to evaluate the merits of the bipolar electrode design as a means to increase the volumetric energy density for low temperature applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Acquisition managers in Premilestone I Acquisition activities face the task of identifying, defining, adn selecting system concepts, and predicting which technologies will best support future acquisitions. A requirement exists for an automated tool which will gather and organize information, facilitate documentation of alternative concepts, tie the components of these alternatives to other information, and support prioritizing these concepts. LGA has developed an approach to automated planning for R&D; organizations, called the Roadmap Information Management System (RIMS). RIMS provides graphical and hierarchical representations of user-defined concepts called Concept Roadmaps. The Concept Roadmaps permit decision makers to document current capabilities, goal capabilities, and subgoals that have to be accomplished to reach the goal. Alternative concepts are represented either as \"alternate paths\" in a single Roadmap or in separate Concept Roadmaps within a single roadmap set. Concept Roadmaps are tied to a database containing other decision-related information. We are proposing to modify the approach used for RIMS to support the additional requirements identified for military acquisition decision support. The proposed Military Acquisition Decision Support System (MADSS) will consist of Concept Roadmaps and linked databases augmented with expert systems to assist in setting priorities and deciding among alternatives.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Leaders must be able to solve the kind of complex, ambiguous problems that arise in organizational settings. Prior research on the determinants of leader performance indicates that metacognitive skills, such as problem construction and integration, have a marked impact on people's ability to solve complex, ambiguous problems. In the effort proposed herein, the literature on cognitive processes and cognitive development in adulthood will be used to construct a model describing how metacognitive skills influence (1) the development of viable knowledge structures and (2) effective processing of knowledge in problem solving. This model will then be used to identify potential measures of each of these metacognitive skills, and automated measures of certain crucial skills will be developed. The reliability and validity of these measures will then be established in a pilot study. Additionally, this model will be used to identify interventions that might accelerate skills development. A set of self-paced, computer-interactive training programs will then be constructed, and their influence on effective application of metacognitive skills in problem solving will be assessed. The validation evidence provided by these studies should provide the infrastructure for future efforts intended to enhance leaders' problem solving skills.",

Some of this wasted energy could be utilized to synthesize exotic materials which have useful commercial applications. In order to utilize this wasted energy to synthesize new and exotic materials, specialty chambers and equipment are needed. This program will review previous efforts to create new material using HELs and other laser synthesis, define the possible methodologies to create exotic new material using HELs, design possible e)cperiments and perform preliminary design for experimental chambers and equipment needed to utilize the waste HEL to synthesize, select materials that have commercial markets. An additional variation is to retrofit existing reaction chamber(s) for scouting experiments to demonstrate the viability of using HELs to synthesize exotic materials including fullerenes and collect data for the design of the equipment that will subsequently be designed and fabricated.",

Critical sizes and other parameters for such anomalies will be determined based on analytical and/or semi-empirical estimates of their adverse effects on dielectric and thermomechanical properties of selected material systems. Few NDT methods, which may include ultrasonics, radiography, various microscopy, computed tomography, thermal imaging, etc., will be selected based on current knowledge of their capabilities (to detect flaws of expected sizes) and/or analytical simulations. Selected methods will be used in NDT on samples of procured materials and the results studied, compared and interpreted. Cost, advantages and improvements needed in the methods will be analyzed for selection of a couple of methods for possible prototype devices to be considered for Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this work is to determine the best possible polycrystalline zirconia from the standpoint of properties and cost for applications in storage heaters. Our prior work has shown that highly stable tetragonal t'-zirconia with domain structure containing (<= 4 mol.% yttria) and monoclinic m'-zirconia containing no yttria exhibits properties superior to cubic zirconia >= 8 mol.% yttria. The excellent properties of t'- and m'-zirconia and stabilizers are the result of their domain structure. A survey of availbale zirconia and stabilizers will be conducted to identify suitable materials from the standpoint of cost. For the determination of optimum composition, samples with yttria content between 0 and 20 mol.% will be fabricated by heat treating at temeparures >= 2000 C. Creep resistance, erosion resistance, thermal shock resistance, strength, toughness, stability at low (200 to 600 C) and high (approx 1600 C) temperatures, and thermal conductivity of conventional tetragonal, highly stable t'-zirconia, shatter-proof m'-zirconia, and cubic zirconia will be measured. This information will be used to identify the most optimum yttria content and processing conditions of zirconia for storage heater applications. It is anticipated that t'-materials with yttria content <= 3 mol.% and m'-materials with no yttria will be the best materials, both from the standpoint of properties and cost.",

Poly-X derivatives possess a unique array of properties among organic polymers and, yet, are projected to be competitively priced at commercial production levels. Composites fabricated with Poly-X resins are expected to be lightweight, have unprecedented compressive strengths, have low flammability, be thermally and thermooxidatively stable, and to be resistant to corrosion and a wide variety of solvents and chemicals. During the proposed Phase I work, 2 kilograms of one Poly-X derivative, to be chosen after preliminary fiber-resin assessments, will be prepared for detailed resin testing, development of processing techniques, and composite panel fabrication and testing. A successful effort will demonstrate that high quality Poly-X composites can be prepared by standard thermoplastic composite fabrication techniques and will provide baseline mechanical and failure properties. Phase II efforts will build on this work and include more detailed testing of larger structural sections to optimize the various parameters (fiber-matrix interface, resin toughness, etc.) critical for achieving the ultimate promise of ultralightweight composites.",

A microcomputer-based data acquisition, analysis, and feedback control system will be developed to control extracorporeal oxygen delivery (by adjusting extracorporeal blood flow) and carbon dioxide removal (by adjusting gas flow through the oxygenator). Such a system is expected to improve the efficacy of oxygen delivery to the patient, maintain metabolic levels with more precision than the manually-controlled system, and provide for automatic weaning of extracorporeal support as patient condition improves. Prolonged extracorporeal life support currently requires continuous supervision in the intensive care unit by a specially-trained technician. Such supervision is very expensive and limits the number of patients who can be supported because of the finite number of technicians at each hospital. An automatic control system would enable one technician to oversee more than one case simultaneously. An automatic control scheme will be developed and tested using continuous recordings of data from patients during extracorporeal gas exchange support. The system will be tested with an in vitro patient model during simulations of events possible during support. These events will include oxygenator failure and changes in patient oxygen requirements.",

The heart of the technology is the use of polytetrafluoroethylene (TFE .1u pore size) ultrafiltration membrane wound in a spiral design to maximize maximize packing density by selecting proper element materials and leaf lengths. One can engineer a spiral wound ultrafiltration element that will be small and light-weight, yet produce proper volumes of ultraclean fuel across the temperature and engine horsepower ranges the Navy needs. The membrane material, TFE will remove all bacteria, solids greater than .1u and free the entrained water to produce the quality heavy fuels demanded by the close tolerances of the high speed direct fuel injectors intendcd for these engines. Although the spiral wound elements will be operated in dead-end mode, the spiral wound design and the TFE membrane allows them to be cleaned in a cross-flow manner or unwound, wiped off and rerolled for reuse.",

A QUANTITATIVE CULTURE OF AN ASPIRATE OF SMALL BOWEL FLUID IS USED TO DETECT BACTERIAL OVERGROWTH. THIS IS OFTEN NOT PERFORMED BECAUSE IT IS SO INCONVENIENT. THE NEED FOR A RELIABLE, NON-INVASIVE SCREENING TEST FOR BACTERIAL OVERGROWTH HAS LED TO THE DEVELOP- MENT OF BREATH TESTS USING RADIOACTIVE 14C SUBSTRATES. A ONE GRAM 14C-XYLOSE BREATH HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY VALIDATED FOR THE SPECIFIC DIAGNOSIS OF BACTERIAL OVERGROWTH. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE 14C-XYLOSE BREATH TEST USES A SMALL RADIOACTIVE DOSE OF XYLOSE, ITS USE IN CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN OR REPEATED USE, DEMANDS DEVELOPMENT OF A NON-RADIOACTIVE ALTERNATIVE TEST. WE WILL DEVELOP A SAFE, NON-RADIOACTIVE, ALTERNATIVE TO THE 14C-XYLOSE TEST USING INSTEAD THE STABLE ISOTOPE 13C. STABLE ISOTOPES SUCH AS 13C EMIT NO RADIATION AND ARE NATURALLY PRESENT IN OUR BODY. THE POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SAFE AND ACCURATE XYLOSE BREATH TEST KIT FOR THE DETECTION OF SMALL BOWEL BACTERIAL OVERGROWTH. THE 13C-XYLOSE BREATH TEST KITS WILL BE EASY TO ADMINISTER IN ANY PHYSICIAN OFFICE AND WILL BE ACCURATE FOR DIAGNOSIS OF BACTERIAL OVERGROWTH.",

THERE ARE MANY CAUSES OF EM EMISSIONS, INCLUDING CABLE CURRENTS AND ELECTROSEISMIC EFFECTS IN ADDITION TO THE OFTEN HYPOTHESIZED \"MAGNETIC BUBBLE\".

THE ELECTROSEISMIC EFFECT OFFERS THE BEST CHANCE OF PROVIDING DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION, PERHAPS IN CONJUNCTION WITH NORMAL SEISMIC TECHNIQUES. IF ELECTROMAGNETIC DETECTION TECHNIQUES PROVE FEASIBLE, THEY WOULD AUGMENT NORMAL SEISMIC TECHNIQUES IN THE DETERMINATION OF WEAPON YIELD, AND POSSIBLY OTHER PARAMETERS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         This is a proposal to research and develop a new diagnostic approach for measuring ion composition and density in high temperature high velocity plasmas. The method proposed is Resonance Holographic Interferometric Spectroscopy (RHIS) applied to plasmas produced in an arcjet torch. RHIS is a new diagnostic technique combining the three dimensional capabilities of holography, the plase sensitivity of interferometry, and the species selectivity of spectroscopy. An arcjet apparatus capable of generating readily variable plasma conditions with temperatures up to 4500K and gas velocities of up to Mach 4 will provide the Phase I testing environment. In addition to ion composition, the RHIS diagnostic has the potential to measure such parameters as temperaature, pressure, velocity, density, mas flus, and electron density. This proposal outlines work to characterize the feasibility of RHIS as a new diagnostic for high temperature plasmas. Recommendations regarding the optimal instrument design and optimal data reduction schemes will be made as a pathway into a Phase II program.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal describes a program to develop a system to measure the spatial distribution of droplet size, liquid water content, and the droplet velocity in engine test cells. The twelve foot duct diameter rules out most light scattering and imaging techniques. The liquid water content of up to 5.6 g/m3 dictates that the probe volume must be no larger than about 10E8 micron3 resulting in a narrow waist with a limited Rayleigh range. To avoid the presence of potentially harmful objects in the inlet path, the proposed system must have a long range with the transmitter and the receiver remaining outside the specified 12 foot duct. The proposed system includes a laser sheet that can be focused to the required waist dimensions anywhere along the duct. The light scattered by droplets crossing the center of the focused sheet is collected by a receiver that tracks the waist position. Several schemes to locate the center of the laser sheet and avoid Gaussian ambiguity will be evaluated. Phase I will include analytical and experimental research that define optimum strategies that will be tested on a breadboard under controlled conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Laser radars which use mechanical systems to scan the beams have several limitations. In addition to the size, weight and power budgets necessary to incorporate and operate them, there are the issues of reliability, maintenance and survivability. Flexibility to vary the scanned field of view and to concentrate on individual items of interest is extremely desirable. An electronically scanned laser that has no moving parts overcomes all the above shortcomings. A linear array of addressable microchip lasers directed through a divergent lens system is proposed. The microchip lasers will be sequentially addressable, lens system is and operated in a Q-switched mode. When combined with either single-element or CCD-array detectors, a compact, low-power, high-resolution laser radar can be achieved, which is effective for such applications as: battlefield target acquisition, classification and tracking, high resolution remote sensing and terrain profiling.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The aim is to evaluate a novel technology for testing the susceptibility of prokaryotes to certain antibiotics. Our goal is to develop rapid antibiotic susceptibility tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other pathogens. The technology will rapidly detect growth of resistant bacteria challenged with antibiotics in pure of mixed cultures, using oligonucleotide probes for two RNA targets: ribosomal RNA precursors (pre-rRNA), and mature ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Cellular copy number of pre-rRNA sequences are very sensitive to rifampicin, declining rapidly upon exposure from high to undetectable levels. By probing for these sequences in cells challenged briefly with rifampicin, it will be possible to detect growing (resistant) cells in a single measurement. Mature rRNA has species-specific sequences useful for detection of bacteria in mixed cultures containing other species. Probes for mature rRNA will be combined with probes for pre-rRNA in a rapid, sensitive, easy-to-use assay that simultaneously identifies bacterial species in primary enrichment cultures and determines their susceptibility to rifampicin and other antibiotics. Such a test would predict the outcome of antibiotic treatment much more rapidly and accurately than conventional tests. In Phase I, we will test the feasibility of the concept using a fast-growing, well characterized bacterium, Escherichia coli. Experiments will focus initially on resistance to rifampicin, one of the \"first-line\" antibiotics for treatment of tuberculosis, and then on other antibiotics. In Phase II, we will transfer the technology to the more challenging Mycobacterium tuberculosis system. Ultimately, we will apply the technology to other clinically important microorganisms as well.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A common requirement of missile delivery systems is an ECM resistant, all- weather, day/night capability. The all-weather, day/night requirement leads to millimeter waves as a reasonable solution. The current proliferation of ARM devices favors passive rather than active modes. An analytical Model of the passive scenario predicts that atmospheric attenuation is not an important consideration, and essentially equivalent performance can be obtained over the entire spectrum from 30 to 140 GHz. The operational availability of the full millimeter wave spectrum for radiometric solutions to tactical weapon sensor requirements, represents a new dimension of opportunity. Other equally important sensor system implications are predicted by the analytical Model. Many have a direct bearing on capabilities of interest to the Air Force Armament Directorate, Eglin AFB. Verification of Model predictions is an important first step. The Phase I Work Plan addresses both the requirements and methods for verification by direct measurement. Active participation by the research staff of the Armament Directorate, Eglin AFB is needed in order to realize the full potential of this effort, by focusing the direction of this investigation on Air Force missions and their future tactical weapon sensor requirements.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The overall objective of this effort is to provide monolithic activity on GaAs/Si substrates for dual-band (3-5 and 8-12 micron) focal plane arrays (FPAs). More specifically to : 1) Determine the most promising GaAs/Si monolithic dual-band approach, 2) Identify Si readout (R/O) circuits, 3) Plan critical material and detector experiments, 4) Provide a monolithic dual-band FPA process, and 5) Layout FPAs and test circuits for 4\" Si wafers. This effort will be based upon the authors' earlier work which replaced In bonds in hybrid FPAs by conformal thin films that interconnect HgCdTe detectors to R/Os in the same Si wafer. The proposed effort will extend this single-band monolithic technology to dual-band FPAs. The effort will determine the best dual-band unit cell in either a tandem or adjacent configuration using HgCdTe for the MWIR and either HgCdTe or AlGaAs quantum wells for the LWIR. R/O design will share charge between the unit cell capacitors and columns to increase signal-to-noise but yet maintain a small cell. The effort will plan experiments for processing the R/Os and detectors and for growing and fabricating detectors on GaAs/Si. The effort will deliver a dual-band process and a layout for 4\" Si wafers that will include test structures and a 8 x 8 and another larger dual-band FPA.",

Our approach is to formulate initial guidelines, develop and test a set of small-to-medium WAVES/VHDL examples, test the set, and derive confirmed guidelines from the results of this testing. We are able to propose this Phase l example testing due to (1) an existing WAVES/VHDL design environment and (2) a set of examples by which to test the guidelines we develop. Specifically, our objectives are to (1) develop the example set, (2) use the example testing to demonstrate the utility of WAVES/VHDL guidelines and usage practices, and (3) recommend and distribute the guidelines and usage practices. The marriage of WAVES and VHDL in this effective design and test paradigm will be a significant enhancement to design practices across the industry. We will encourage use of, and obtain feedback upon, the guidelines through an organized contact, distribution, and follow-up program with industrial and government users. This will cultivate an acceptance of the guidelines even as they are being formulated, which will continue into the Phase II effort. The products of the Phase I effort, guidelines, demonstrated performance and industry acceptance/contacts, will form a solid foundation for Phase II.",

This approach is based on a canonical functional representation which yield multidimensional measurements of the nonlinear and/or nonstationary characteristics and allow system identification beyond usual linear and time-invariant (stationary) models. This approach can be applied to acoustic, electromagnetic and communication signals to extend recognition/cIassification capabilities beyond traditional linear time/frequency domains and reduce false alarm rates. The proposed techniques\\' utility/povver will be demonstrated by deteiled analytical derivations, computer simulations, and test results on acoustic end radar data representing detection/classification tasks of interest to the Navy. MultiSpec has considerable experience with nonlinear and/or nonstationary analysis of real data in areas of importance for the Navy. UItra-wideband radar is enhanced when converted into a system identification task and higher-order signal analysis tools are used for target characterization. Data from ultra-vvideband radar discrimination experiments using targets of metal, clutter, and radar absorbent materials are shown in terms of bispectra and nonlinear kernels. Theory, simulations, and actual results from underwater acoustic data shovv the achievable with our new techniques for nonstationary analysis of transient signals.",

Enhancements in storage will continue to lag microprocessor advances for years to come. Nanotronics, Inc. has initiated a research effort that promises to change the paradigm in mass storage, thereby enabling up to 100 times improvement in planar surface storage capacity with concurrent increases in data transfer rate. Nanotronics has developed enhanced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymers that will absorb excitation light energy at a single wavelength and re-emit predetermined multiple wavelengths, all occurring at ambient temperatures. By emitting spectra rather than binary on/off bits, the data word size is increased significantly and parallel access is enabled. Data will be stored in the molecular structure of synthetic DNA, bringing true nanotechnology to science and industry. The diffraction limit of current optical storage systems will be circumvented because data bits per unit area will increase with the number of distinguishable pre-programmed wavelengths. Thus^ wavelength is the third dimension for this optical data storage scheme. Furthermore, a four-dimensional secondary storage scheme may be possible by adding a third spatial dimension that would further multiply the storage density. ^'^",

AN INNOVATIVE COMBINATION OF THEORY AND EXPERIMENT WILL PRODUCE IMPROVED MATHEMATICAL MODELS FOR THE DIRECT SIMULATION OF UNSTEADY AERODYNAMIC FORCES AND MOMENTS WHICH, WHEN COMBINED WITH A SIX-DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM EQUATION-OF-MOTION SOLVER, WILL HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO PREDICT FLIGHT TRAJECTORIES AND MANEUVERING PERFORMANCE OF MANEUVERING FLIGHT VEHICLES. THE PROPOSED COMPUTATIONAL METHOD, SUITABLY ECONOMICAL FOR PRELIMINARY DESIGN AND ANALYSIS PURPOSES, WILL BE APPLICABLE TO STUDY CONFIGURATIONAL EFFECTS ON UNSTEADY SEPARATED FLOWS AND THE SUBSEQUENT INDUCED DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS. THE UNSTEADY NONLINEAR AERODYNAMIC PREDICTION METHOD, INCLUDING PROPULSION EFFECTS, WILL BE CONSIDERED IN COMBINATION WITH A STRUCTURAL DEFORMATION MODEL TO PROVIDE A COMPLETE SIMULATION METHOD. EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON (1) THE UNDERSTANDING AND MODELING OF THE PHYSICS OF COMPLEX FLOW PHENOMENA ASSOCIATED WITH FLOW SEPARATION, AND (2) AN ANALYTICAL PREDICTION METHOD WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE OF THE AERODYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS FOR SPECIFIC CONFIGURATIONS. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS - SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PHASE I FEASIBILITY STUDY AND DEMONSTRATION WILL LEAD TO A PHASE II EFFORT TO PRODUCE A SIMULATION METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF FIGHT VEHICLES IN UNSTEADY MANEUVERS INVOLVING HIGH ANGLES OF ATTACK. THIS UNIQUE CAPABILITY WILL PROVIDE GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHYSICS OF THE COMPLEX UNSTEADY FLOW FIELDS AND IMPROVED ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR FUTURE FLIGHT VEHICLES.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Within DoD there is a current need for the design or redesign of aircraft-borne weapon airframes to meet conformal/internal carriage requirements. A major constraint imposed by confromal/internal carriage is a limitation on the maximum stowable fin span of a weapon. Current aircraft such as the F-117 and future aircraft such as the F-22 are designed with internal carriage capability, but current weapons systems such as the Sidewinder and AMRAAM require modifications to meet these carriage requirements. Design or re-design of weapon airframes requires an extensive expenditure of labor and funds. Missile engineers can not simply reduce the span of missile fins without incurring potentially detrimental changes in the aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle. Nielsen Engineering & Research (NEAR) proposes to develop an innovative design tool employing combined numerical optimization/aerodynamic prediction techniques for the optimal aerodynamic design of missile fins with geometric constraints such as those imposed by conformal/internal carriage and constraints set by actuator torque limits. This advanced optimization-based design tool will reduce the development time and costs associated with missile fin design or redesign.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The ability to display critical information within the optical train of a night vision device has become a requirement in the aviation community. The current display approaches rely on CRT's, optical combiners, lenses, and fiber optic cable to inject the symbology within the optical train of the night vision device. Besides decreased image tube life, bulkiness, and additional weight, the performance and safety of such systems is considered marginal. Night Vision Corporation (NVC) has developed a unique approach to incorporate symbology within the optical train of a night vision device with much greater potential. We are proposing the insertion of a transparent LCD at the output side of the tabe which can provide a multi-color display. This approach also allows for a relatively simple image fusion of intensified and HUD projected scenes. NVC proposes to conduct a complete survey of current technology to develop system requirements and then build and deliver a prototype of the approach within a ANVIS Night Vision Goggle Monocular.",

Although a variety of antennas have been designed for the new radio systems, extensive attention has not been devoted to solving tactical user problems confronting troops in the field. Such aspects as size, weight, visibility, transportability and survival under field handling conditions ahve not been adequately addressed. Moreover, in the case of some mechanically complex designs, antenna cost begins to approach or exceed that of the transceiver. This proposal presents a number of techniques which are available to reduce weight, size and associated visibility while maintaining or increasing existing bandwidths.",

The x-ray film and post examination film development are eliminated. The spatial resolution or pixel sizes less than 30 x 30 micron2 is achievable. The detector can have high sensitivity and excellent quantum efficiency which could approach 100% for 15 to 20 keV x-rays reducing the patient dose rate significantly. It has excellent linear response within the wide dynamic range which is expected to be equal to or greater than 1,000, and it has a good potential for large area sensor fabrication. Signal-to-noise ratio greater than 20 can be achieved for detecting 20 keV x-ray photons. Exposure times of equal to or less than 0.6 seconds should be achievable with the current x-ray sources. It could have fast instantaneous imaging capability, which is important for radiotherapy, biopsy, surgery and fine needle aspiration procedures. The mammography system can be designed with stereoscopic imaging capability. Computer based data acquisition allows post examination image processing and enhancement. Phase I involves the design, assembly and testing of a small desktop prototype mammography system and theoretical analysis to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed design. During Phase II and III a fully functional prototype mammography system will be built.",

Currently, no materials and processing technology simultaneously meet all the requirements for practical holographic device applications. It seems advantageous to selectively optimize the promising materials for particular applications. We propose to synthesize high performance photorefractive films of BaTi03, LiNb03, and GaAs by an innovative plasma-enhanced metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (PE-MOCVD) process, with the emphasis on BaTi03 in Phase I. The three material systems are chosen because they have the highest figures of merit (diffraction efficiency, long storage time, and sensitivity, respectively) for different holographic applications. Effective processing technologies will also be developed to substantially improve the weakness of each materials, e.g. increasing the sensitivity of the ferroelectrics by methods of transition-metal doping and chemical reduction; increasing the diffraction efficiency of semiconductor through the growth of quantum well structures. PE-MOCVD is ideal for holographic device fabrication due to its high growth rate, large-area, and low temperature processing capabilities. Moreover, the PE-MOCVD offers the potential for monolithic or hybrid-processing compatibility with OEIC device technology. Phase I addresses the heteroepitaxial growth of optical quality BaTiO3 films for holographic applications.",

THE STUDY WILL USE A CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART MISSILE SENSOR, WHICH DOES NOT CONTAIN BOES, AS THE BASIS FOR COMPARISON. THIS OPTICAL SYSTEM WILL BE REDESIGNED TO EMPLOY BOES. THE LOCATION OF THE BOES WITHIN THE SENSOR WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF A SERIES OF TRADES WHICH WILL CULMINATE IN A FULLY OPTIMIZED FINAL DESIGN AT THE END OF PHASE I. THE MECHANICAL DESIGN, FABRICATION, ASSEMBLY AND TEST WILL FOLLOW IN PHASE II. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PHASE I PROGRAM WILL MAKE POSSIBLE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PERFORMANCE AND REDUCTIONS IN SIZE AND COST FOR THE NEXT GENERATION MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL SENSORS, WITH EMPHASIS ON MISSILE SYSTEMS AND ROBOTICS APPLICATIONS.",

THE APPROACH TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE SMALLER DIMENSIONS OF VERTICAL CAVITY SURFACE EMITTING LASERS (VCSELs) WHICH RESULT IN INCREASED RELAXATION OSCILLATION FREQUENCY AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED DAMPING OF THE RESPONSE. THESE LIMITATIONS IN VCSELs ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED OVER THOSE IN IN-PLANE LASERS. A RESONANCE FREQUENCY PER SQUARE ROOT COEFFICIENT OF 7.6 GHz PER SQUARE ROOT MILLIWATT HAS BEEN DETERMINED USING RELATIVE INTENSITY NOISE MEASUREMENTS, AND A MAXIMUM RELAXATION OSCILLATION FREQUENCY OF 71 GHz WAS OBSERVED BY STREAK CAMERA MEASUREMENTS, ON AN 8 MICROMETER SQUARE VCSEL.

The proposed effort addresses the establishment of planar (N4) and volume (N5) \"smart\" global (multi-dimensional) optical interconnects for digital optoelectronic computing hardware. The purpose of the program is to define, develop, and map C3I algorithms and related subroutines into 4-dimensional optical interconnects. Once mapped efficiently, these optical interconnect configurations are to be incorporated into 2-dimensional planar holographic optical interconnect (hardware) elements (HOIEs). Ultimately, reconfigurable 3-dimensional volume holographic optical interconnects elements (V-HOIEs) for N5 \"smart\" optical interconnects will be incorporated into the final design. By implementing \"smart\" pixel technology coupled with free space global optical interconnects, two primary objectives will be accomplished. The first objective is to generate algorithms and subroutines for mapping into 2D arrays (32 x 32) of thin planar holographic optical interconnects (HOIE) as well as the HOIE hardware technology required. This HOIE program will be leveraged with current 2-D GaAs DANE (detection, amplification negation and emission) technology. The second objective is to focus on a 3D volume interconnect technology for reprogrammable N5 topologies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A scanning infrared viewing system is proposed for mapping the radiation emitted by the internal surfaces of turbine engines. The viewing system will consist of a rotating, traversing probe housing that will be inserted in the exhaust nozzle of the engine during tests conducted in AEDC test cells. The viewing system will provide point-to-point mapping of emitted radiation which will then undergo image processing to produce the final image. During the Phase I effort, the feasibility of the proposed approach will be demonstrated both analytically and through a bench top demonstration. Final design, fabrication, and testing of the full-scale development system will be conducted during Phase II of the program.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         OPTRA PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A VERY HIGH PRECISION PHASEMETER FOR USE WITH HETERODYNE INTERFEROMETRY. IT IS BASED ON TWO INNOVATIONS: A PROPOSED POLARFASH PHASE-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTER, AND A HIGH-SPEED 3-PHASE DEMODULATOR WHICH TAKES THE MEASUREMENT AND REFERENCE SIGNALS FROM THE HETERODYNE INTERFEROMETER AND GENERATES THE INPUT SIGNALS FROM THE POLARFLASH CONVERTER. THE PROPOSED PHASEMETER HAS SHOT/ELECTRONIC NOISE-LIMITED RESOLUTION ( 0.001-CYCLE RESOLUTION SHOULD BE ATTAINABLE WITH A 5 KHZ BANDWIDTH), NEGLIGIBLE UNWRAPPING ERRORS, A VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED DYNAMIC RANGE, AND WILL WORK WITH HETERODYNE FREQUENCIES FROM 100 KHZ TO 40 MHZ. THE DEMODULATOR GENERATES BASEBAND SIGNALS THAT ARE PROPORTIONAL TO PHI,(PHI+2PI/3), AND (PHI-2PI/3), WHERE PHI IS THE INSTANTANEOUS INTERFEROMETRIC PHASE. THESE SIGNALS GO TO THE POLARFISH CONVERTER, WHICH FUNCTIONS IN AN ANALOGOUS MANNER TO A FLASH A/D. ONE OF THE ATTRACTIVE FEATURES OF THIS APPROACH IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT IT WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INEXPENSIVE ASIC HAVING THE CAPABILITY OF 8- OR 12-BIT PHASE RESOLUTION FOR FREQUENCIES FROM DC TO PERHAPS AS HIGH AS 100 MHZ. PHASE UNWRAPPING WILL BE DONE WITH EXISTING AND PROVEN ELECTRONICS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED AT OPTRA. UNWRAPPED PHASE DATA WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE FORMS OF A 32-BIT PARALLEL WORD, AND ANALOG VOLTAGE, OR A PAIR OF A-QUAD-B PULSE TRAINS. THE PROPOSED PHASE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM SHOULD IMPROVE INTERFEROMETRIC PHASE-MEASUREMENT PRECISION BY A FACTOR OF AT LEAST 10 TO 100, AND WILL BE INEXPENSIVE.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Graphical depiction would be a more useful and easily comprehended method of verifying real-time software performance than methods currently in use. It could be applied across a wider range of applications to increase real-time software reliability and decrease development costs. ORINCON proposes an innovative method for dynamically displaying real-time software timing information, This method would provide the capability to collect timing data for a real-time system and replay it using time lines and color coding to show the relationship of execution times to budgets. Displays would be shown in layers so that timing could be analyzed at different levels, from the top-level system processes down to the subroutine level. Processor loading also would be displayed. The collected timing data would be replayed at an operator-selected speed to aid in understanding. Static graphs of cumulative statistics, such as average execution time, would also be provided. In this method, the decoupling of the display of the timing data from its collection would not only permit the replay to be done at a selectable speed, but also would be a key factor in minimizing the effort required to evaluate real-time software performance on different target hardware.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Intruder detection using a mobile platform with multiple sensor suites is difficult because of the ever-changing warehouse environments in which the robots operate. Doppler shifts caused by platform motion or intruder motion also add to the problem. ORINCON proposes a novel approach to intruder detection that uses a statistical differencing technique on multiple-sensor-suite digitized snapshots at preprograumied locations in the environment. Image differencing of digitized video camera frames has been used successfully in industry to detect intruders by detecting changes in the background from frame to frame. ORINCON takes this notion a step further. First, during initialization, a robot takes several digitized sensor snapshot measurements along a preprogrammed path and stores the data and the measurement locations. On subsequent path passes, the snapshot measurements-taken at the same locations-are compared to the initialization measurements by differencing. If \"significant\" discrepancies exist, then an intruder detection is determined to have occurred. If not, then the most recent snapshot is stored for the next pass. The main thrust of the proposed work will be to determine what \"significant\" discrepancies are and how they are related to probability of detection and probability of false alarm.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A novel class of postaglandin F2-like compounds formed in vitro or in vivo by a free-radical catalyzed noncyclocxygenase mechanism have recently been discovered. For normal humans. Levels of these compounds (called F2-isoprostanes) range from 5-50 pg/ml plasma and 500-3000 pg/ml urinary creatinine, respectively. The in vivo concentration of F2-isoprostances have been shown to increase dramatically in animal models of free-radical induced lipid peroxidation. Although the potential role(s) of isoprostanes in the pathophysiology of human diseases remain to be determined, preliminary evidence strongly suggests that measurement of isoprostane concentrations may have significant diagnostic potential for the assessment of oxidative stress and in specific disorders such as hepatorenal syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and carcinogenesis. Isoprostances have, thus far, been detected by mass spectrometry. However, this is an expensive method that is not well suited for routine clinical determinations. In contrast, immunoassay is an established clinical procedure that is well suited for the detection of small amounts of specific fatty acid derivatives. The ultimate goal is the development of sensitive and specific immunoassays for isoprostanes that will facilitate (a) investigations of the physiologic and pathophysiologic roles of these compounds and (b) clinical assessment of oxidative status.",

Availability of specific antibodies will greatly facilitate studies of polymorphisms, species and tissue distribution of drug metabolizing enzymes, and the role of individual enzymes in the metabolism of endogenous and xenobiotic chemicals. Widespread availability of specific antibodies will overcome current limitations. Some of these limitations include restricted access to antibodies, differences in specificity between preparations, and lack of specificity for many antibodies. We have already developed several goat antibodies directed against rabbit cytochromes P450; antibodies specific for prostaglandin H synthase, including anti-peptide antibodies specific for the recently discovered mitogen inducible PGHS-2, may exhibit a different spectrum of xenobiotic activation than PGHS-1. We are currently developing anti-peptide antibodies specific for mammalian lipoxygenases, which are also implicated in xenobiotic metabolism. However, we are well aware of the primary need for additional antibodies specific for P450 isoforms. We will therefore: (a) acquire available form-specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies by licensing form academic laboratories where possible, (b) to develop a series of anti-peptide antibodies and recombinant protein standards to the major P450 isoforms, and (c) to extensively characterize the specificity and reactivity of these antibodies in standard assays.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Dataware engineering is an emerging methodology for the application neural networks and associated techniques to specific problems. It is based on a comprehensive theory of systems that learn from experience and reason by analogy, called \"correlithms.\" Research into dataware engineering has recently suggested a new and potentially very powerful analysis methodology for coordinating data from a variety of sources. (This coordination is commonly called \"sensor fusion.\") If found feasible, this approach will allow the design and implementation of generic systems capable of utilizing data from diverse sources to produce a single environmental perspective, in other words, \"situationally aware\" systems. This project will test this approach on a problem to be jointly developed with the Office of Primary Responsibility.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal is for a new and innovative approach to multi-spectral sensing that address several areas of need: o Non-cooperative target recognition o Ship self defense o Sensor technology for couterstealth-aircraft o Missiles o Global surveillance. In this proposal we will describe a means of measuring the fine spectrl signature of targets with in the field of view of an imaging sensor. This technique works from the ultraviolet to the millimeter spectral region. It is most applicable in the infrared spectral band for measuring the spectrum of missile and aircraft plums. However, it is also applicable for other purposes such as measuring biological and gas warfare. It can be used in missile seekers, missile warning system, (both tactical and strategic), as a means of identifying non-cooperative targets and also can be used for identifying friend or foe. Pacific Advanced Technology has invented a technique for performing multi-color imaging using staring arrays. This technique not only enables a sensor to measure multi-color, it provides the capability to measure the fine spectral signatures of targets with a resolution of less than 0.01 um in the mid infrared spectral region. Under contract to the Air Force Space Division, Pacific Advanced Technology evaluated and demonstrated the applicability of the \"Image Multi-Spectral Sensing\", (IMSS), concept for application in space surveillance and early warning systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Approximately 40% of patients suffering from the sepsis syndrome are infected with Gram negative bacteria. It is this subset of patients that stand to benefit from new therapies designed to neutralize endotoxin such as anti-lipid A monoclonal antibodies (e. g. E5 or HA-1A) and bacterial permeability inducing protein (BPI). Because of the enormous cost of these therapies we plan to develop a simple, sensitive test for early detection of Gram negative bacteremia. Our hypothesis is that conserved regions exist in certain genes of Gram negative bacteria that can serve as targets for rapid and sensitive diagnosis of these lethal pathogens. Preliminary data suggest that there are in fact highly conserved regions that can be used to design PCR primers for detection of small numbers of bacteria. Phase I goals will refine the use of this test by determining the sensitivity and specificity using a large set of clinical bacterial isolates from various body fluids. Evaluation of the test in a field trial in suspected septic patients will be carried out in Phase II. Introduction of this test into clinical practice should save millions of dollars spent on the unnecessary use of new and very expensive therapies for gram negative sepsis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) using Photofrin is nearing regulatory approval both in the U. S. A. and abroad. It has been shown by a number of researchers that hyperthermia (HT), less than 45 degrees centigrade, has a strong synergistic effect in combination with PDT. This synergism appears to be maximized when the HT is given concurrently with PDT instead of sequentially. It has also been shown that the local hyperthermia condition can be produced by a near infrared laser, Nd:YAG or AlGaAs diodes, through the same delivery systems used for PDT. This has been referred to as Laser Hyperthermia, or LHT. It is our objective to develop an integrated LHT-PDT delivery system with a common computer-based control and monitoring system. The system will allow for use of pre-existing lasers, both HT and PDT, which are delivered to the system via fiberoptic cables. Each laser is to be individually controlled and combined into a single optical delivery fiber. The control system is to be based on a PC compatible computer and will provide active control of the LHT and PDT power levels, treatment intervals, monitoring and display of eight temperatures and four light intensity levels, tissue temperature stabilization, light dosimetry, and display the information in a user friendly manner. The emphasis in Phase I is to develop the system, and to test it in an appropriate animal model.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Segmented diaphragm linear flexure bearings are the single major innovation which has extended the service life of linear drive cryocoolers from a 4,000 hour mean time to failure to a potential 80,000 hour operational life. Unfortunately, the design, fabrication, installation, and alignment of such bearings is an art. Material selection, fabrication processes, quality control, allowable cyclic stress, dynamic behavior, mounting provisions, alignment processes, radial/axial stiffness, and the establishment and maintenance of radial clearances are reoccurring problems with each new application. The spiral cut diaphragm is the prevalent configuration. The three leg tangential configuration is a recently described alternative with lower peak stress per unit radial stiffness. This improvement does not resolve the design, fabrication, installation, and alignment problems. This project will examine and compare the spiral and tangential flelxure for designing reproducible, highly reliable, long life, radially stiff elements for assembly in integral precision cartridges. The innovative aspect is to develop a metallurgically bonded precision aligned integral bearing cartridge with tight tolerance internal and external mounting diameters. Such cartridges, externally similar to ball bearing cartridges, will greatly simplify the use of these bearings. The metallurgical bonding process will be demonstrated and evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Integrated, modular, and easy to use digital simulations of the end- to-end performance of spacecraft sensors, structures, and supporting subsystems can provide powerful insights into many systems. This includes surveillance satellites and related spacecraft weapon and remote sensing systems. Such simulations can support a wide range of functional capabilities in the design, development, and operational life cycle of such spacecraft. Traditional approaches to end-to-end system modeling have produced very large computer programs not conducive to interactive usage. The rapidly evolving capabilities of computer workstations, new system programming environments, and advanced graphics and user interfaces, however, provide a new capacity to integrate hitherto separate computer models operating in different environments into interactive high fidelity system simulations. This project will develop a design and proof-of-concept kernel for an end-to-end simulation of the critical elements of a space-based passive sensor system by applying these new workstation tools and software development techniques. This design will be an initial step in providng an integrated set of spacecraft/sensor system engineering and analysis tools.",

The modules will be based on vertical-cavity surface-emmitting lasers integrated discretely or monolithically with other optoelectronic or electronic circuitry. This technology has the attributes sought for OSPs: compactness, high speed, low power, high gain, high contrast, versatility, robustness to environmental changes, simple implementation into systems, and reconfigurability. The principle and co-investigators will utilize their extensive pioneering experience in this technology, optimizing the designs for analog systems such as image processing and neural networks. Close interaction with groups presently working on OSPs will insure utility for systems under development. Objectives are: 1)evaluate the usefulness to OSPs of device configurations; 2)determine the performance limits; 3)identify potential users of the technology; 4)identify the optimum module; 5)develop a fabrication process for the module; and 6)develop a Phase II project plan to demonstrate and deliver 2-D arrays to HDL and arrange financing to bring components to commercial availability.

OPTICAL INTERCONNECTIONS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE LESS CONSTRAINED AND DO NOT REQUIRE A MATERIAL PATH BETWEEN INPUT AND OUTPUT PORTS. IN ADDITION, THE FLEXIBILITY OF HOLOGRAPHY TO ENABLE HIGH FAN-OUT INTERCONNECTIONS WITH LOW LOSS AND CROSSTALK ALLOWS MORE ADVANCED COMPUTER ARCHITECTURES TO BE CREATED. FURTHER, BY DEVELOPING MULTIPLEXTED GRATINGS THAT ARE ANGULAR AND WAVELENGTH MULTIPLEXED, IT IS POSSIBLE TO CREATE MORE POWERFUL AND FLEXIBLE INTERCONNECTION NETWORKS THAN TYPICAL FAN-OUT HOLOGRAPHIC NETWORKS CAN ACHIEVE. THIS ALLOWS BOTH MULTIPLE INTERCONNECTION PATTERNS OR ADDRESSABLE INTERCONNECTIONS TO BE CREATED THAT GIVE REAL-TIME RECONFIGURATION CAPABILITIES WITH STATIC HOLOGRAMS BY CHANGIING EITHER THE INCIDENT ANGLE OR WAVELENGTH.

This real-time processor will have a narrow band intensity response, enabling it to single out a certain temperature range pertaining to the target of interest. In order to improve a previously known method for input image coding, POC proposes a new concept of phase encoding. This technique eliminates the halftone recording \"bottleneck\": a need for complicated halftone screen design for hard-clipping recording media. The technique is expected to achieve three orders of magnitude input dynamic range and a higher light throughput, even for high-number diffraction orders. A variety of phase recording materials will be examined to demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, while Phase II research will be aimed toward real time implementation of the proposed all optical non-linear processor for narrow band discrimination. This will be done using POC\\'s erasable photopolymer and optically addressed spatial light modulator. Phase II will result in an integrated optical system consisting of a nonlinear preprocessor and an optical neural network for effective pattern recognition.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         To reduce the complexity of Hartmann sensor optics and to adapt the wavefront sensor (WFS) to variable spatial sampling, Physical Optics Corp. proposes to design a novel WFS based on the Fresnal Image (FI) effect whereby a periodic structure illuminated by coherent light will image itself with variable multiplication depending upon the position of the observation plane. Local wavefront distortion (deviation from a plane or a sperical wavefront) causes displacement of corresponding elementary images sonstituting an FI of a periodic structure. A simple algorithm is proposed to compute wavefront local tilt from displacement measurement. The WFS has various advantages over other methods. The optical system is extremely simple, can be implemented in any spectral range, and give a clear two-dimensional pattern of inhomogeneties of the aerodynamic field. By selecting the transmittance profile of the elementary object, it is possible to adjust the WFS spatial sampling rate to the medium under investigation. The method can be used for long-aperature analysis and has higher sensitivity than the Hartmann method. A high rate of temporal sampling will be achieved by employing two 15KHz frame rate dedicated CCD arrays and POC's proporietary 48 DSP boards permitting highly parallel image processing.",

POC proposes here a miniaturized HBDOP system that utilizes a specially designed optical imaging system to reduce the size of the HBDOP system. The proposed project will refine the holographic array recording system to produce larger scale (128 x 128) subholograms and smaller size (500 x 500 um2) hologram arrays for massive interconnection and parallel processing not achievable by VLSI. POC will also explore applications of this HBDOP system to high-speed radar signal processing, morphological image processing and neural network target recognition operations. At the end of Phase I, an engineering design of a prototype miniaturized HBDOP system will be provided for Phase II fabrication.

The HPOC design does not rely on exotic coherent optical processing techniques or buldk lens imaging systems. It uses only state-of-the-art fiber-optic components. The HPOC concept uses a spinning drum on which up to 1024 distinct gray level encoded reference signals are placed. A light beam emitted by an LED and modulated by the incoming sonar signal is incident upon the drum and picked up by a fiber faceplate which conducts the light signals to a 1024 x 1024 CCD array. To eliminate the correlation DC background and increase the system's dynamic range, the HPOC will incorporate positive and negative CCD detection channels. With the HPOC, ten million parallel correlations can be performed. The unique, extremely high parallelism of computation, which even today's most powerful digital computers do not have, would allow simultaneous correlations with a large number of reference signatures. The HPOC is expected to solve the difficult data analysis problem of detecting and identifying underwater moving targets in the presence of extraneous noise.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In order to increase the data processing/communication abilities of the next generation real-time image processing systems, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to design a VLSI chip or chip set which will incorporate both electronic and photonic processing/communication hardware elements in one system. By using new techniques, a 3-D, Optically assisted cellular array \"machine\" for real-time image processing operations could be achieved and would outperform conventional, strictly electronic image processing systems. In addition to the benefit of scaleable expansion, photonic interconnect technology will allow a compact, 3-D system packaging solution without introducing the problems of heat dissipation and crosstalk that are encountered in conventional 3-D electronic signal processing hardware. Phase I work will include the designs for both electronic processing element photonic interface units which constitute the basic building blocks of the proposed 3-D, optically assisted cellular array machine. In addition, the architectural design of a real-time image processing system will also be implemented. A number of algorithms will be simulated in this conceptual system in order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed optically assisted cellular array machine.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A program for the development of a flow actuator for active control of flow separation on flight surfaces is proposed. The actuators will be used to modulate flow through discrete jets located on the aerodynamic surface. These jets (known as Vortex Generator Jets or VGJ's) produce streamwise and ring vortices which enhance boundary layer mixing and inhibit flow separation. This actuation technique lends itself to the development of a closed-loop active control system for flow separation control on aircraft flight surfaces because of the potential compactness of each actuator element and the simplicity of their operation. The ability to implement the control system only when necessary will allow improved aircraft performance over an extended flight envelope. In the proposed work plan, a flow visualization technique based on laser-induced fluorescence of a molecular flow tracer will be used to study the effects of this actuation technique on a separated flow surface. The influence of modulation frequency and amplitude on the effectiveness of this control scheme will be determined. The experimental results will be used as guidelines for the design of a Phase II prototype actuator for large-scale testing at flight conditions.",

The common pixel registry afforded by the design permits unique spectral information to be extracted from cluttered background and target analysis with sub-pixel spatial resolution. The application effort will address the use of the proven characteristics of the system in the 3 to 5 and 8 to 12 Hm spectral ranges to the signatures extant in tactical battlefield and aircraft scenes, including cruise missile detection. A laboratory effort will address the issues involved in adapting the instrument concept for use in the l to 3 Hm range and to shorter wavelengths. Instrumental configurations are presented that cover both the atmospheric windows at 3 to 5 and 8 to 12 pm. Illustrative estimates of the achievable noise equivalent temperature change (NEAT) of the instrument are presented.",

THE INNOVATION IS TO APPLY DIELECTRIC-BARRIER DISCHARGE TECHNOLOGY TO GENERATE ACTIVE NITROGEN AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE. MERCURY FLUORESCENCE AT 253.7 NM WILL BE EXCITED BY THE ACTIVE NITROGEN WHEN SMALL SAMPLES CONTAINING MERCURY AT PPB LEVELS ARE INTRODUCED INTO THE ACTIVE NITROGEN DISCHARGE. ACTIVE NITROGEN EXCITATION OF ATOMIC FLUORESCENCE TENDS TO POPULATE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF STATES SO THAT THE RESULTANT FLUORESCENCE SPECTRUM IS SIMPLE AND EASY TO ANALYZE. THUS, A COMPACT INSTRUMENT OF MODEST RESOLUTION WILL SUFFICE TO DETECT THE FLUORESCENCE. IN THE CASE OF MRCURY DETECTION, AN INTERFERENCE FILTER AND PHOTOTUBE SHOULD BE ADEQUATE. THE BASIC TECHNIQUE IS GENERAL AND HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO ALLOW MULTISPECIES DETECTION AT PPB LEVELS. THE USE OF DIELECTRIC-BARRIERDISCHARGE TECHNOLOGY TO GENERATE THE ACTIVE NITROGEN AFFORDS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A LIGHTWEIGHT INSTRUMENT WITH LOW POWER REQUIREMENTS (A 12 V BATTERY) SO THAT A TRULY PORTABLE INSTRUMENT CAN BE CONSTRUCTED. IN ADDITION, THE ACTIVE NITROGEN SOURCE CAN BE MOUNTED ON THE END OF A PROBE ALLOWING DIRECT, REAL-TIME ANALYSIS OF THE FLUE GAS TOXICS. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT IS DIRECTED TOWARD FIRST OPTIMIZING THE PRODUCTION OF ACTIVE NITROGEN IN A DIELECTRIC-BARRIER DISCHARGE TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM SENSITIVITY FOR MERCURY, AND THEN TO DEVELOP TECHNIQUES TO ALLOW SAMPLES TO BE DRAWN DIRECTLY FROM A COMBUSTER EXHAUST INTO THE ACTIVE NITROGEN SOURCE. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM WILL USE AN ENTRAINED-FLOW, HIGH TEMPERATURE COAL COMBUSTION FACILITY. THE GOAL OF THE PHASE I PROJECT IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE SENSITIVITY AND FLXIBILITY OF THIS TECHNIQUE SO THAT A PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT FOR MONITORING MERCURY IN FLUE GASES CAN BE DESIGNED AND FABRICATED IN A PHASE II PROGRAM.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The LOFARgram has long been a standard means of representing sonar signals in a combined time-frequency presentation. The LOFARgram represents a particular way of casting the time-frequency distribtution of acoustic energy as a 2-dimensional image. Thus it is natural to apply the techniques of image and seismic processing to the problem we address in this proposal; namely, the need for additional capabilities for the automated detection of the full spectrum of acoustic radiation in passive undersea data and enhanced presentation to the operator. Our approach to this problem is to apply the techniques of image and seismic processing in conjunction with public and commercial image and signal processing packages to develop, on a desk top computer, a multi-dimensional signal processing testbed or tool kit which can be used to enhance desired features in time series data. The data will be displayGd in the LOFARgram format, after processing. When the tool kit is completed one or two processes will be analyzed and ROC curves developed as time allows.",

THE SENSING ELEMENT IS A SMALL DROP OF A RUBBERY CROSSLINKED HETEROGENEOUS POLYMER ATTACHED TO THE END OF AN OPTICAL FIBER. THE POLYMER CONTAINS FUNCTIOINAL GROUPS, E.G. AMINES, THAT REACT WITH HYDROGEN ION. PROTONATION OF THE AMINE GROUPS INTRODUCES A FIXED CHARGE WHICH CAUSES THE POLYMER TO SWELL DUE TO ELECTROSTATIC REPULSION. BECAUSE SWELLING MOVES THE HETEROGENEITIES IN THE POLYMER FURTHER FROM THE OPTICAL FIBER SURFACE, IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY A DECREASE IN THE QUANTITY OF LIGHT DIFFUSELY REFLECTED BACK INTO THE OPTICAL FIBER AT THE PHASE INTERFACES WITHIN THE POLYMER. REFLECTED INTENSITY SERVES AS A MEASURE OF THE PH OF THE MEDIUM. THE PH SENSOR CAN ALSO SERVE AS THE INTERNAL ELEMENT IN A CARBON DIOXIDE SENSOR. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY CONTACTING THE PH SENSITIVE POLYMER WITH A SOLUTION OF BICARBONATE AND COATING IT WIHT A HYDROPHOBIC CARBON DIOXIDE PERMEABLE MEMBRANE. THE SENSORS OFFER IMPROVED RUGGEDNESS AND STABILITY AT REDUCED COST COMPARED TO OTHER PH SENSING TECHNOLOGIES.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The recent advent in Personal Communications Networks, PCN, and Cellular communications has demanded low cost ferrite components for the RF front ends operating at 9GHz cellular and 1.8GHz GSM bands. The thrust of Personal communication is now being directed towards otherISM (instrumentation, scientific and Medical) bands which allow unlincensed operation at frequencies of 2.4GHZ, 5.8GHz, and 39 GHZ. Additionally licensed cellular systems are being developed at 28GHz. The theme, and reality, for the success of such system is low cost components which are amenable to production methods for mass manufacture. The 28 GHz and 39 GHz cellular systems will operate in large cities where reflections from large buildings and strucutres will enable long distance inter-city communications using very small antennas. Ferrite components, such as circulators and latching circulators are used in the front-ends of two way communication systems. The requirement of low cost and high performance demand ferrite components in formats that utilize minimum parts, surface or drop in mounting, small size and minimum interference withinterface with other transmission medium. Princeton Microwave Technology, a microwave component manufacturer, and Xtalonix, a microwave ferrite material manufacturer, are proposing to address the low cost manufacture of ferrite components by using novel injection mouldingmethods. The original ferrite components, developed by ETDL, will be prototyped in Phase I using isostatic and hot pressing methods and the ferrite material optimised for high performance. The Phase II plan will then advance the manufacture of the low cost components using state of art injection moulding methods and will directly address the forthcoming communication markets that are fast emerging.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         An Electrostatic Enhanced Filtration (EEF) technology is proposed for NBC collective protective systems such that the efficiency of the current NBC filter medium can be enhanced to at least 99.997 at 0.3 micron, without any increase in the pressure drop of the current medium. This technology also has the potential to kill bacterial components of the aerosol, and possibly also viruses. On the other hand, some amount of ozone is generated by the process (which can be reduced by optimizing the electrode and field configurations). This is a feasbility study, aimed at establishing the required design parameters (e.g. field strength, and electrode geometry) such that the efficiency enhancement is maximized and the ozone production is minimized. A 500-1000 scfm prototype will be constructed and evaluated for efficiency and pressure drop. The effect of the minimized ozone production on ventilation requirements to meet NIOSH standards for ozone, will also be established by means of a material balance model (Jaisinghani et al. 1989). Additionally, a preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness of the device in terms of killing bacteria, will be conducted.",

Phonological processing difficulties refer to problems in processing oral or written language due to an insensitivity to the sound structure of language. A large literature base suggests that difficulty in phonological processing is the most widely agreed upon cause of reading-related learning disabilities and other kinds of early reading difficulties. However, an effective and practical individually administered test of phonological processing skills has yet to be published. Such a test should be of considerable use to school psychologists, reading specialists, and other special student services personnel in the identification of children whose decoding deficits can be traced to phonological processing difficulties. The specific aim of Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of a comprehensive test of phonological processing for children in grades one through six.",

Initial estimates project a reduction factor of 10 to 30 in power dissipation when state-of-the-art CMOS is replaced with advanced, charge-mode logic. For example, a 32-bit serial shift built with 1um design rules and operating at 200 MHz and 5V power will dissipate 5 mW in charge mode logic and 180 mW in CMOS. While the 36:1 factor can not be maintained in more complex functions, a 10:1 ratio appears to be feasible. During Phase I, meaningful processor architectures will be developed in charge-mode logic. Their performance will be simulated. In Phase II proof-of-concept processor elements will be built.",

The culture system will be comprised of serum-free medium and various cytokines. Serum-free medium will allow the direct effect the cytokines have on the fetal hematopoietic cells to be free of the extraneous components found in fetal bovine serum. Such an in vitro system will be valuable in assessing the changes in fetal blood populations during ontogeny. Fetal sheep will be used in these studies because of the well defined sequence of events in maturation of the blood system. In sheep, the liver is hematopoietic from day 20 to gestation, spleen from day 50 and bone marrow at about 70 days of gestation. Cells isolated from these tissues at various times will be placed in liquid culture containing serum-free medium and various cytokines. From these, cultures cells will be removed, both immediately and intermittingly, placed in soft-agar assays containing various cytokines and evaluated for colony formation (CFU-Mix, CFU-GM, and BFU-E). Such an approach will allow the characterization of the fetal hematopoietic populations during ontogeny.",

A SYSTEM THAT REPRESENTS A NEW APPROACH TO THE MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE FOR POSITION AND INTENSITY MONITORING IS PLANNED IN THIS PROJECT. THE OPERATING PRINCIPLE OF THE SYSTEM DIFFERS FROM EXISTING THIN-WIRE PICKOFF ANTENNAS TUNED TO DETECT THE ELECTRIC FIELD FROM THE BEAM IN THAT THE MAGNETIC FIELD FROM THE CURRENT IS MEASURED DIRECTLY IN PICKUP LOOPS. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE USE OF A CLOSED SUPERCONDUCTING LOOP, COUPLED TO A SUPERCONDUCTING QUANTUM INTERFERENCE DEVICE (SQUID). ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM INCLUDE A MUCH LOWER LIMIT ON MEASUREMENT THRESHOLD AND DYNAMIC RANGE DUE TO THE EXTREME SENSITIVITY OF SQUIDS FOR MAGNETIC FIELD MEASUREMENTS, AND A GREATER FLEXIBILITY FOR INTEGRATING THE SYSTEM INTO THE BEAM PIPE BECAUSE OF THE SMALL DIMENSIONS OF THE PICKUP LOOPS. PHASE I WILL DETERMINE THE SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE PLANNED SYSTEM AND INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE TECHNIQUE. THE GOAL OF PHASE I RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A DESIGN FOR A PROTOTYPE BEAM POSITION AND INTENSITY MONITOR FOR USE AT CEBAF.

SOLUBILITY IS A MAJOR FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE METABOLISM OF THE INHALED ISOTOPES AND DISSOLUTION RATES OF ALPHA-EMITTING COMPOUNDS WHICH ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT DUE TO THEIR HIGH RADIOTOXICITY. CURRENT SOLUBILITY TESTING PROTOCOLS ARE SUFFICIENTLY COMPLEX THAT THEY ARE NORMALLY FOUND ONLY IN RESEARCH LABORATORIES. MUCH BENEFIT COULD BE DERIVED FROM THEIR USEIN OPERATING PLANTS. IN THIS WORK WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING SIMPLE LUNG SIMULANT FLUIDS FOR THE SOLUBILITY TESTS, AND STRAIGHTFORWARD SOLVENT EXTRACTION CHEMISTRIES TO TRANSFER THE RADIONUCLIDES FROM THE LUNG FLUID SIMULANT DIRECTLY INTO AN EXTRACTIVE SCINTILLATOR WITH MINIMAL SAMPLE PREPARATION.

A two-stage baseline system is proposed to accomplish this, consisting of a multisensor processor front-end, which employs dominant-mode prediction (DMP) and polychannel DMP (PC-DMP) to detect, copy, and localize emitters on the basis of their variation in time-frequency support (temporal burstiness and/or bandwidth extent); and a signel-sensor processor back-end, which employs log-likelihood functions (LLFs) and per-survivor-processing (PSP) algorithms to classify and demodulate the dehopped/downconverted emitters provided by the processor front-end. Both stages provide optimal (GLRT) statistics for detection and classification of the emitter waveforms, and provide optimal (ML) estimates of the emitter waveforms under appropriate modelling conditions. In addition, the baseline processor is compatible with channelized digital reconnaissance systems under current development, such as the TACJAM A system, in that they can operate against emitters with bandwidths larger than the frequency channelization of the reconnaissance system, even if that system employs undersampled frequency channelizers that do not allow complete regeneration of the emitter time series",

The length of the resonator will be 1 to 3 mm with a finesse of 100 or higher. This large finesse will make the effective Vpi about 0.1 voltes while using short, low capacitance electrodes. As a result bandwidths will exceed 10 GHz. In addition we will fabricate a reference resonator on the same substrate without electrodes to discriminate against temperature and wavelength fluctuaitons. In Phase I we will fabricate multiple resonators on the same substrate with metallic mirrors. RAMAR has, in the past, fabricated such resonators with a finess of 40. We will measure the bandwidth and voltage sensitivity. We will evaluate the similarity of resonators on a single substrate for using one as a reference. RAMAR is a four year old company devoted exclusively to the design, manufacture, and marketing of lithium niobated modulators for the communications, CATV and sensor industry. We are involved with the complex packaging issues for these devices and are well positioned to cooperate with Phillips Laboratory to commercialize this technology.",

A SUSPECTED CARCINOGEN, SELENIUM IS ALSO HARMFUL TO FISH AND FOWL WHEN PRESENT IN SURFACE WATERS. PROCESSES DEVELOPED FOR SELENIUM REMOVAL FROM DRINKING WATER (ANION EXCHANGE AND ACTIVATED ALUMINA) HAVE TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS WHICH MAKE THEM TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS. IN PARTICULAR, THESE PROCESSES ARE APPROPRIATE FOR SMALL VOLUMES OF WATER WITH LOW LEVELS OF DISSOLVED AND SUSPENDED SOLIDS. FOR THESE PROCESSES TO ACHIEVE HIGH REMOVAL EFFICIENCIES, THE SELENIUM MUST BE PRESENT AS ONLY ONE ANIONIC SPECIES, AND COMPETING ANIONS LIKE SULFATE OR CARBONATE MUST NOT BE PRESENT. THEREFORE, TDA RESEARCH PROPOSES USING EMULSION LIQUID MEMBRANES (ELM) TO REMOVE SELENIUM FROM INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER STREAMS. BASED ON THEIR PREVIUS RESEARCH WITH CHROMIUM (VI) CONTAMINATED WATER, TDA EXPECTS ELM TO CONCENTRATE SELENIUM BY A FACTOR OF APPROXIMATELY 1000. IN PHASE I, THEY WILL CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS TO DEMONSTRATE PROCESS FEASIBILITY, AND CARRY OUT ECONOMIC ANALYSES TO COMPARE THEIR ELM PROCESS WITH OTHER COMPETING SELENIUM CONCENTRATION AND/OR REMOVAL PROCESSES.",

THEREFORE, THERE IS AN INCREASING NEED FOR LOW COST AND EFFICIENT METHODS FOR THE CONTROL OF CHC EMISSIONS.

HOWEVER, THE CURRENT CATALYSTS DO NOT PERFORM NEARLY AS WELL AS THOSE USED IN THE DESTRUCTION OF NON-CHLORINATED VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. PRECIOUS METAL CATALYSTS SUCH AS PLATINUM HAVE LOW ACTIVITY AND MUST BE RUN AT TEMPERATURES IN EXCESS OF 500 DEGREES CENTIGRADE TO OXIDIZE THE CHCS AND AVOID CATALYST DEGRADATION. BASE METAL CATALYSTS ARE MUCH MORE ACTIVE, BUT ARE POWERFULLY POISONED BY WATER. IN PHASE I, TDA WILL SYNTHESIZE AND CHARACTERIZE A SERIES OF HIGHLY ACTIVE MODIFIED METAL OXIDE CATALYSTS WHOSE ACTIVITY IS ENHANCED BY THE PRESENCE OF WATER.

SEVERAL REFRACTORY METALS ARE HIGHER IN PERMEABILITY, AND ARE STRONGER AND CHEAPER THAN PALLADIUM; THEY ARE NOT ORDINARILY USED FOR THESE APPLICATIONS BECAUSE POOR SURFACE PROPERTIES REDUCE HYDROGEN TRANSPORT. WHEN THESE REFRACTORY METALS ARE COATED WITH PALLADIUM, HOWEVER, THE SURFACE BARRIERS ARE REDUCED. MEMBRANES THAT RESULT SHOW HYDROGEN FLUXES AS HIGH AS 0.095 MOL/M(2)S FOR A DRIVING PRESSURE OF 0.78 ATM AND A THICKNESS OF 0.25 MM, MORE THAN TEN TIMES GREATER THAN THOSE AVAILABLE WITH PALLADIUM AT 420 DEGREES CENTIGRADE, AT LOWER COST AND WITH THE SAME 100% SELECTIVITY. SUCH MEMBRANES CAN BE MADE THINNER THAN 0.1 MM BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTH OF THE REFRACTORY METALS. THINNER MEMBRANES SHOULD SHOW STILL HIGHER HYDROGEN FLUXES BECAUSE FLUX INCREASES AS MEMBRANE THICKNESS DECREASES. MEMBRANE COSTS ARE ESTIMATED AS $2500/M(2) IF THE MEMBRANES ARE MASS-PRODUCED.

The objectives of the Phase I efforts are to develop a suitable mechanism which can be deployed into a variety of different UST configurations. Also, the sensing system used to determine the robot's location within the tank is a key technology which must be adapted from current techniques. A prototype of the mechanism will be built to prove the selected concept. After testing on a UST mock-up, the design will be refined and modified with the goal of providing a hardened design. Phase II and III will be used to develop the controller to dirve the sytem and develop custom software and procedures for performing inspections.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         1As budget constraints tighten, reliance on information resources to produce cosst savings will increase. Effective management techniques and automated tools are needed to help IRM project managers control ADP system design, development, implementation and change processes. Recent advances in Personal Computer (PC) technology provide new tools to control system development projects throughout their life cycle. NAVSEA has invested in these PC tools for its professionals; thus creating the opportunity to integrate the tools to allow IPM project managers to efficiently plan and execute system development projects. During Phase I, RGS will evaluate the IRM project management processes to define methodologies for controlling IRM projects and requirements for automated tools. Criteria will be developed to tailor the methodology and tasks for unique requirements of individual ADP development projects. Our Phase I effort will produce: (1) a requirements document prepared in the format of a Functional Description (FD) to describe the management methodology and use of the automated tools, and (2) a prototype of the automated tools which integrates off-the-shelf software packages for database management, optical imaging and expert systems in a PC environment. The FD will serve as the design document for development of the prototype, which will confirm the viability of the management strategy while demonstrating the usefulness of automated tools.",

A generic whole body scanner will be designed, and a software simulation system will be implemented and used to test the design and to evaluate alternative system configurations. We propose to develop and test our technique based on a non-contact, optical, multi-sensor range scanning technique that digitizes the entire surface in less than one second. This device employs \"white light\" pattern projectors and employs no harmful ionizing radiation. This approach allows the digitization of complex surfaces with the use of appropraite sensor (digital cameras and light beam projectors) configuration. Multi-resolution data, depending on the requirement, can be collected for different surfaces simultaneously or separately and integrated together to provide one comprehensive data set describing the body surface. The expense of collecting anthropometric methods used presently. 3D surface data of the human body will provide accurate anthropometric measurements useful in the design and evaluation of advanced aircraft and modern personal protective equipment systems.",

The proposed system will be competitive with the best laboratory equipment, even that most recently available. To meet other, less stringent Air Force requirements, the direct RF generation architecture could be tailored to provide a broad range of tuning bandwidths, settling times, frequency accuracies and spectral purities. By using direct microwave RF generation controlled by a fast, very broadband Phase-Lock Loop (PLL), the system avoids the hardware intensive filtering techniques necessary in traditional upconversion and multiplication schemes and will employ readily available commercial hardware, providing extremely attractive size and cost efficiencies. The proposed system also avoids the phase noise problems of DDS's. The proposed Phase I SBIR program will present the results of laboratory breadboard experimentation; will provide a specific high performance, affordable design for Phase II development and demonstration, with performance, size and production cost estimates; and will offer a proposed Phase II SBIR hardware development and demonstration program plan.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The extraordinary political changes since 1989 have led to abrupt and fundamental changes in the National Military Strategy of the United States, which in turn have totally altered the focus and substance of U.S. military force planning--and led to increased demands for improved development planning. This puts the development planner into a particularly acute predicament for two reasons: the development planner has an enormous span of responsibility, and tools which were barely adequate even before the increased emphasis on development planning--much less now. In the last three years, much progress has been made in treating certain elements of the force planning and acquisition problem, specifically in the development and production of a core set of force effectiveness parametrics applicable to conventional warfare in which theater level campaign analyses were performed within the \"Strategy to Task\" as well as the acquisition directives (DoDI 5000.1/.2). This proposal takes advantage of the applicable elements of that progress to create a tool that will substantially reduce the development planner's burden.",

Previous studies have examined the use of microchannel cooling devices to address this problem, but the performance of these devices has been limited by fabrication constraints. Saddleback Aerospace is proposing an alternative microchannel fabricaiton approach, which results in a doubling of the heat dissipation capability compared to previous work, and provides a much more robust microchannel structure. In this effort, analytical trade studies will be performed, and two prototype semiconductor laser array coolers will be fabricated. The thermal and flow performance of the coolers will be evaluated in laboratory testing. The result will be a sound analytic and experimental basis for the near-term development of practical semiconductor laser array coolers.",

It was believed that random Chaotic variations were too complicated to describe mathematically and statistical descriptions were the only means of understanding these dynamic systems. Now it is known that these chaotic systems are not just random fluctuations but are tottally deterministic. More importantly they can be controlled by studying the nature of the Chaos and applying small perturbations to the systems parameters. SEO with the help of Dr. Bandy's group at Oklahoma State University, propose to use the recent techniques of stabilizing nonlinear dynamic systems on a diode pumped external cavity resonator. Experimental and computer modeling of laser the external resonant cavity will be conducted witht different stabilizing parameters studied.",

In an effort to extend the identification. In an effort to extend the identification range, Schwartz Electro-Optics, Inc. (SEO) proposes to develop a concept for Non-Cooperative Combat Identification by sensing the vibrations of targets with Doppler Laser Radar. Vibrational signature measurement with Doppler laser radar has been successfully demonstrated using CO2 lasers. Issues of size, cost, weight, and reliability of the laser have prevented deployment of these sensors. Recent developments in two micron solid state lasers can allow vibrational signature measurement in a compact, reliable sensor. Eyesafe operation is maintained at this wavelength, as is the ability to penetrate obscurant and dust on the battlefield. The proposed Phase I effort draws on past and on-going activities at SEO to prove the feasibility of target identification, and to develop a preliminary design of a prototype sensor. The effort will include an analysis and assessment of available signature data, a parametric design study of the sensor parameters, and development of a top-level, prototype sensor design.",

EXAMPLES OF SUCH MATERIALS ARE SUPERALLOYS AND METAL-MATRIX COMPOSITES WITH GRADED THERMAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES. A GRADED COMPOSITION NICKEL-BASED SUPERALLOY AIRCRAFT TURBINE DISK FABRICATED USING HEEB POWDER METALLURGY TECHNIQUES WOULD OPERATE AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES WITH THE IMPROVED DEFORMATION RESISTANCE NEEDED FOR THE HIGH SPEED CIVILIAN TRANSPORT AND NEXT GENERATION FIGHTER AIRCRAFT. A HEEB MATERIAL PROCESSING SYSTEM WOULD ALSO ALLOW COST EFFECTIVE SURFACE HARDENING OF STEEL UP TO DEPTHS OF 5 MM. THE AVERAGE POWER LEVELS NOW AVAILABLE USING HEEB ARE 5-25 TIMES HIGHER THAN COMPETING PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS LASER LAYER GLAZING AND PLASMA SPRAYING. HIGH AVERAGE POWER CONTRIBUTES TO HIGH THROUGHPUT AND COST EFFECTIVE HEEB MATERIAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS. SCIENCE RESEARCH LABORATORY (SRL) HAS DEVELOPED A NEW GENERATION OF PULSED INDUCTION LINEAR ACCELERATORS WHICH ALLOW RELIABLE, COST EFFICIENT PRODUCTION OF HIGH AVERAGE POWER ELECTRON BEAMS WITH THE NECESSARY PARAMETERS FOR HEEB MATERIAL PROCESSING. A UNIQUE FEATURE OF THESE ACCELERATORS IS THE HIGH REPETITION RATE (>5000 PPS) ALL-SOLID-STATE PULSED POWER DRIVERS WHICH MAKE THESE ACCELERATORS SCALABLE TO MW POWER LEVELS AT AN ELECTRON BEAM COST OF LESS THAN $1/WATT. A HEEB MATERIAL PROCESSING SYSTEM BASED ON THIS TECHNOLOGY IS DESCRIBED. EXPERIMENTS TO BE CONDUCTED IN PHASE II WILL DEMONSTRATE COST EFFECTIVE HEEB PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR FABRICATION OF GRADED ALLOY TURBINE DISKS AND SURFACE HEAT TREATMENT OF RAIL STEELS. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS - INDUCTION ACCELERATOR BASED HEEB MATERIAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE NEW MATERIALS OF MILITARY INTEREST. TWO APPLICATIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS PROPOSAL ARE GRADED SUPERALLOY AIRCRAFT TURBINE DISKS AND RAIL STEELS SURFACE HARDENED TO DEPTHS OF UP TO 5 MM.",

THE DIAGNOSTIC IS BASED ON AN EQUAL-PATH, LATERAL SHEARING INTERFEROMETER AND CAN BE ANLAYZED, IN PRINCIPLE, AS A FORM OF DOPPLER VELOCIMETER. THIS SYSTEM REQUIRES ONLY INCOHERENT LIGHT EMISSION FROM THE PLASMA ITSELF FOR OPERATION. THE DIAGNOSTIC CAN BE ADJUSTED TO RESPOND PRIMARILY TO INHOMOGENEITIES BELOW A GIVEN SCALE SIZE, MOVING ALONG A GIVEN AXIS, WITHIN THE LIMITED FOCAL VOLUME OF THE COLLECTION OPTICS. THE INFORMATION OBTAINED IS THUS LOCALIZED IN THREE DIMENSIONS AND IS NOT A LINE-OF-SIGHT AVERAGE. THE RESULTING SIGNAL IS DIGITIZED AT MHZ FREQUENCIES FOR THE DURATION OF A TOKAMAK RUN AND ANALYZED LATER WITH A FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM. THE PEAK FREQUENCY OF THE SIGNAL IN A DATA SEGMENT, COMBINED WITH THE SPATIAL SCALE SIZE SETTING AND THE ORIENTATION OF THE SENSING AXIS, DETERMINES THE FLOW VELOCITY OF THE PLASMA INHOMOGENEITIES IN THAT TIME INTERVAL. MULTIPLE SENSING HEADS CAN BE COMBINED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE SPATIAL SCALE SIZE SPECTRUM. SCALE SIZES FROM A FRACTION OF A MILLIMETER UP TO ONE CM CAN BE RESOLVED ALONG WITH FREQUENCIES OF UP TO SEVERAL MHZ.

These improvements are essential to meet stringent performance requirements for next generation propulsion systems. The improvements are more pronounced for small engines, because clearance effect in small engines accounts for a bigger portion of rotating component losses than large engines. Scientific Aero Monitoring, Inc. proposes to conduct a reserch program on active clearance control for a small turboshaft engine. The firm should like to evaluate the feasibility of current and innovative clearance control concepts, and carry out the design, simulation, and demonstration of the most feasible concept in a test rig. The firm should like to focus its research on centrifugal compressors, because it is the preferred type for small turboshaft engines. The firm presented a candidate clearance control system in this proposal, although the candiate control system should not limit the firm's assessment of other feasible control concepts. Scientific Aero Monitoring, Inc. was founded with a vision to utilize the efficiency and concentration of a small business to facilitate technology development and adaptation. The firm emphasizes accountability and goal-oriented work ethics. The investigators for the proposed program offer more than 35 years of combined experience in aerospace system modeling, design, development and testing. A major portion of this combined pool of experience is directly related to the gas turbine engine field.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A model-based approach is proposed for multichannel system modeling and detection in the context of radar system applications, using higher-order statistics (HOS) for the identification of time series model parameters. The model innovations sequence is used for the detection decision. In general, HOS-based algorithms offer several advantages over conventional time series methods based on second-order statistics. Higher-order cumulants contain information about the system phase, and thus can be used to model both minimum-phase and non-minimum-phase systems. This allows a larger model class for the modeling of radar return signals. HOS-based algorithms specifically address the cases where the desired signal portion does not exhibit Gaussian statistics, which is the cases in many radar system applications. Additionally, the higher-order cumulants are insensitive to additive Gaussian-distributed noise, such as receiver noise and interference sources. Thus, cumulant-based algorithms offer potential for improved performance in many radar target detection problems.",

EXPERIMENTS HAVE SHOWN THAT GROUND VEHICLES AND HELICOPTERS HAVE DISTINGUISHING SPECTRAL COMPONENTS IN THEIR DOPPLER SIGNATURES. THESE KEY SPECTRAL FEATURES CAN BE MUCH WEAKER THAN THE UNWANTED CLUTTER ECHOES. CONSEQUENTLY, TARGET CLASSIFICATION IN A HIGH CLUTTER ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES FREQUENCY SELECTIVE FILTERING TO SEPARATE WEAK SPECTRAL FEATURES FROM THE STRONG CLUTTER. IT IS ALSO DESIRABLE TO RESOLVE SIGNALS AND CLUTTER WHICH ARE CLOSELY SPACED IN FREQUENCY AS MIGHT OCCUR WITH SLOWLY MOVING VEHICLES. EXISTING CLUTTER REJECTION TECHNIQUES, WHICH USE WEIGHTED FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM (FFT) PROCESSING, SUFFER FROM DEGRADED FREQUENCY RESOLUTION. A NEW POWERFUL TECHNIQUE OF SPECTRUM ANALYSIS BASED ON STOCHASTIC REALIZATION CONCEPT IS PROPOSED HERE WHICH IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE HIGHER RESOLUTION SO THAT SLOWER-MOVING TARGETS CAN BE CLASSIFIED IN A HIGH CLUTTER ENVIRONMENT. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RESULTING ALGORITHM WILL BE COMPARED TO THE STANDARD FFT APPROACH. THE PROPOSED STEPS TOWARD THE MAJOR OBJECTIVE ARE (1) MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF THE PROCESS, (2) PERFORM STATE-OF-THE-ART SURVEYS ON KEY RADAR TECHNOLOGY AREA, (3) ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING, AND (4) SURVEY AND EVALUATE CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The rise of launch clouds to stabilization is forced by an altitude varying distribution of momention and buoyancy (temperature). In most of the plume, the temperature excess over that of the atmosphere is large and the buoyant force accelerates the launch products to \"high\" altitudes. The acceleration is retarded by the exhaust velocity, but augmented strongly by water vapor phase changes and possibly by heat release from residual chemistry. Turbulent diffusion of the buoyancy with or without wind shear and atmospheric temperature gradients stop the flow above the neutral buoyancy level; the flow falls back and the cloud is transported within the prevailing weather. The cloud may be toxic. We develop a first-principle computational capability centered on a proven cloud formation code (PSR/2DSALE). A tailored grid with variable vertical resolution based on specific launch profiles is proposed, and we develop a distributed buoyancy and momentum source function based on the \"ground\" cloud and standard plume flowfield. We plan a test calculation matrix with stable and unstable atmospheres, high and low moisture profiles, and wind shear. We add PSR's multicomponent first-principle microphysics code to account rigorously for particle growth in the plume and cloud. Extension to a Phase II 3-D capability is planned.",

Element suppliers have continued to use a 31 mil thick feed channel spacer, first pioneered by DuPont in the mid 1960\\'s. There is continuing evidence that this mesh spacer configuration is a major contributor to membrane fouling by forming \"dead areas\" of low flow behind the spacer segments which trap the foulants. During cleaning operations, these foulants may be loosened from the membrane surface but cannot be flushed out of the element. The fouling materials remain trapped within the mesh spacer and redeposit on the membrane upon repressurization, thereby obviating the effects of the effects of the cleaning operation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Work by M. Binder and the army ETDL has shown that the RF plasma treatment of capacitor films, electrode foils and wound rolls, can result in significant and in some cases dramatic improvements, in the electrical breakdown strength of certain capacitor films and capacitor rolls. In this investigation we will demonstrate potential commercial applications of the RF plasma treatment that will allow this technology to be licensed by film producers and capacitor manufacturers. In order to identify the commercialization potential of the film surface treatment, a high power hollow cathode RF reactor will be used to reduce the treatment time so that the process can be used to treat webs of film that are moving at production-like speeds. Contact angle, adhesion and ESCA analysis will be done on the surface of the films, to relate the data to the work done by the ETDL and further quantity effects of the O2 and CF4/02 plasmas. Treated films will be metallized with and with out exposure to air, and the self healing characteristics will be studied. Aluminum and tin foils with widths varying from 0.25\" to 6.0\" will be plasma treated and treated in wound capacitors, to determine the relationship of the foil edge treatment to the breakdown strength of the capacitors. Wound rolls will be plasma treated in a box etcher both by mechanical fixuring and by placing the rolls inside a cage that is rotating in the plasma chamber. The latter method will allow large quantities of small capacitors to be treated uniformly at a low enough cost, that will make this process cost effective even for marginal enhancements in the dielectric strength of the parts.",

Silhouette Technology has developed a new technology to make a low cost, reliable, PC based, DOE film printer offering a high space-bandwidth product. The device offers performance which exceeds the capability of existing systems such as electron beam recorders and laser printers. It will be able to print with a resolution of 2 microns and a positioning accuracy of less than 1 micron. The system output will be directly to film and provide hard copy and photoresist printing.

The software reliability modeling methodology and tool to be developed under this effort can make outstanding contributions to reducing system and software reliability problems by (a) identifying areas where deficiencies are most likely to be found; these can be functional areas (e.g., redundancy management) or software technology areas (e.g., task synchronization), (b) permitting rapid evaluation of the reliability benefits of alternative software or system configurations, (c) providing an objective basis for hardware/software trade-offs, and (d) providing an objective basis for reliability/performance trade-offs. The effort consists of (1) definition of software reliability metrics for distributed Systems, (2) establishing model selection criteria, (3) model evaluation, and (4) prototyping the selected model.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is the most common exhaust-gas-treatment process being used today to control NOx from stationary combustion units. However, SCR has some disadvantages. For example, SCR is very expensive to install and to operate; it employs catalysts that are easily blinded; it requires ammonia additions that sometime slip through the catalyst beds; it generally performs satisfactorily only at high temperatures. Recently, Sorbtech developed for the Air Force a simple, low-cost alternative to SCR for controlling NOx in exhaust gases produced in jet-engine test cells (JETCs). The development is a two-bed filter that demonstrates attractive removals of not only NOx, but also of CO, small (P-10) particles, SO2, HC1, and other contaminants. The new filter could have many Air Force and civilian applications, in addition to JETCs. The proposed project will explore three of these potential applications (natural-gas boilers, diesel engines, and a waste incinerator) at actual sites at McClellan AFB.",

RECENTLY, A NEW, INEXPENSIVE CATALYST WAS OBSERVED TO RESULT IN THE CONVERSION OF MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OF AN SO2-RICH GAS STREAM TO YELLOW, ELEMENTAL SULFUR DURINGA SINGLE PASS OF THE GAS THROUGH THE CATALYST BED AT ABOUT 700 DEGREES CENTIGRADE AND ATMOSPHRIC PRESSURE.

THIS CREATES A NEED FOR EFFICIENT DATA COMPRESSION ALGORITHMS FOR DIGITIZED IMAGE SEQUENCES. VIDEO IMAGES TYPICALLY CONTAIN A LARGE AMOUNT OF SPATIAL ANDTEMPORAL REDUNDANCY; THUS VERY HIGH COMPRESSION RATIOS ARE FEASIBLE IN PRINCIPLE. HOWEVER, EXISTING VIDEO COMPRESSION TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS THE CCITT STANDARD, CANNOT CONSISTENTLY ACHIEVE HIGH COMPRESSION RATIOS BECAUSE THEY UTILIZE FIXED IMAGE PARTITIONS AND SIMPLE MOTION ESTIMATION ALGORITHMS. HIGHER PERFORMANCE WILL BE OBTAINED BY UTILIZING THE PROPOSED VIDEO COMPRESSION APPROACH BASED ON MULTIRESOLUTIONIMAGE REPRESENTATIONS AND ADAPTIVE MOTION ESTIMATION PROCEDURES. THE MULTIRESOLUTION APPROACH DECOMPOSES IMAGES INTO SEVERAL RESIDUAL IMAGES CONTAINING THE SCENE FINE STRUCTURE AT DIFFERENT SCALES. BY SEPARATELY ESTIMATING THEMOTION PARAMETERS OF THE SIGNIFICANT FEATURES AT EACH RESOLUTION, THE LARGER FEATURES IN THE SCENE WILL BE COMPRESSED FAR MORE EFFICIENTLY. THE PHASE-I STUDY WILL INVOLVE AN EXAMINATION OF TWO DIFFERENT MULTIRESOLUTION REPRESENTATIONS (THE LAPLACIAN PYRAMID AND THE WAVELET TRANSFORM), THE DEVELOPMENT OF MOTION ESTIMATION ALGORITHMS FOR THE RESIDUAL IMAGES, AND AN EVALUATION OF COMPRESSION PERFORMANCE ON SELECTED VIDEO IMAGERY.

Our device is constructed of a three dimensional array of pixels, actually \"voxels,\" which in their quiescent state are transparent. When these elements are excited optically, through a fiber optic pigtail, they flouresce. The sum of many flourescing elements thus compose a three dimensional image. This spatial monitor will be used in many applications to visualize, and interact with, three dimensional images. In particular, Air Force applications will greatly benefit from this novel human/machine interface. For example, the situational awareness of a operator engaged in a three dimensional task will be greatly increased. When coupled with a two dimensional display for horizon views, this three dimensional monitor will be a useful training platform.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The firing of indirect fire weapons and the effect of incoming rounds have historically been simulated pyrotechnically. Weapon firing has been simulated by firing blank rounds and the effect of incoming rounds has been simulated by small explosive charges. Pyrotechnics have the advantage of being the simplest way to create the sound of an explosion, which is difficult to duplicate by other means. Moreover, the pyrotechnic mixture can be compounded to produce the desired levels of flash and smoke. Pyrotechnics also have several disadvantages. Being explosive devices, the charges present storage and handling hazards, and firing the charges carries the risk of igniting accidental fires. Spectra Researc (S*R) proposes to overcome these limitations with a non-pyrotechnic explosion simulator that is compact, reusable, and configurable for a range of effects. The proposed simulator uses a pneumatic shock tube to generate the sound, a non-toxic aerosol agent to generate the smoke, and a flash tube to generate the flash of an explosion.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The need exists for portable instrumentation with the capability of real-time monitoring of human environments for a variety of toxic gases generated by military weapons systems. Spectral Sciences, Inc. (SSI) proposes to build a Gallium Arsenide Semiconductor-laser Multigas Analyzer (GASMAN) which will provide automatic, unattended, real-time monitoring of several toxic gases. GASMAN employs multiple diode-laser in conjunction with multiplexing techniques to simultaneously monitor air samples for fimve or more toxic species in a common flow-through sampling cell. GASMAN uses techniques of wavelength modulation and line-locked absorption detection common to several gallium arsenide-based snesors developed by SSI for automated and unattended operation in the detection of single species in open air. GASMAN incorporates these features, along with a long-path absorption cell, multiple diode-laser sources, and multiplexing techniques. An internal microprocessor system controls experimental sequencing and stores several hours of continuous concentration data with sub-second time resolution. The resulting system is portable, compact, lighweight, and has low power consumption requirements. The objective of this work is to develop a prototype system for deployment in military applications. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of the GASMAN approach b y monitoring representative toxic gases using a breadboard incorporating three basic elements; line-locked detection, a multiple-pass absorption cell, and multiplexced laser-diodes. Phase Ii development will lead to a working prototype.",

THE RC IS INSTALLED ON THE BURNER WALL OF A CONVENTIONAL COAL BOILER TO REPLACE THE EXISTING BURNERS AND MILLING EQUIPMENT, THUS ELIMINATING THE POWER CONSUMPTION OF THE MILLS AND RAISING EFFICIENCY. LIMESTONE IS FED IN WITH THE COAL TO CAPTURE THE SULFUR WITHIN THE RC WHICH IS VERY EFFECTIVE AS THE TEMPERATURE RANGE OF THE ROTATING FLUIDBED IF CONTROLLED. THUS, SULFUR CAPTURE IN EXCESS OF 90% IS PREDICTED. THE RC INCORPORATES A COOLED FIRETUBE WITH SECONDARY AND TERTIARY AIR ADMISSION, THEREBY REDUCING NOX TO SIGNIFICNTLY LOWER LEVELS THAN CONVENTIONAL BURNERS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         This program will develop high power diode lasers in compact packages with fiber optic output. The approach will involve design, fabrication, and mounting of single high power CW diode laser array bars and the fiber pigtailing of these bars into completed laser modules. The approach will be to use single array bar packages, thereby avoiding the expensive \"rack and stack\" design. A single 1-cm array bar package will be pigtailed into a 400 micron diameter core fiber, with an expected CW output power in the 10W level. The uniqueness of the proposed approach is that it will utilize Spire's previously developed low cost laser array bar fabrication techniques, and provide for the coupling of these bars into a single fiber delivery system. Spire uses proprietary fluxless vacuum soldering for mounting 1 cm, coated array bars without solder voids, and proposes to use all-refractive optics for efficient fiber coupling. The Phase I effort will result in the delivery of a proof-of-concept fiber-coupled demonstrator emitting at the 10W level. Future Phase II work will be directed at extending this approach into the 50-100W level.",

A SQUID offers new technology for measurement of magnetic flux at low frequencies with unprecedented sensitivity. Its extreme sensitivity at low frequencies can provide an electromagnetic microscope for eddy current NDE of underlying defects and hidden corrosion in airframes. Our measurements with a prototype SQUID microprobe, using niobium technology at 4 K, show that it reliably finds a 1 mm flaw through 6 mm of aluminum, at 88 Hz and a standoff of 4 mm, as well as material loss less than 1% from corrosion under a 2.29 mm thick aluminum plate. The new capability offered by a SQUID microprobe together with advances in fabricating SQUIDs and pickup coils from high-temperature superconductors provides a technological opportunity for developing a hand-held, electromagnetic microscope for evaluating hidden defects in airframes during flight-line operations. Its development requires the combined skills of experts knowledgeable in (1) eddy current NDE of materials, (2) NDE of military and commercial airframes, (3) fabrication of SQUIDs from high-temperature superconductors, and (4) use of SQUIDs for eddy current NDE. To realize the promise of a new capability for inspecting the aging fleets of both military and commercial aircrafat, we propose to lead a development team comprising IBM, Northrop Corporation, Boeing, and SQM Technology, Inc.",

The desired SCA will accept both analog and digital inputs, and will provide graphics and text output on a screen and for external storage. The SCA will include a flexible graphical user interface and will be especially user friendly. A system architecture that uses off-the-shelf hardware, including a host computer, will be designed and the hardware components will be specified in Phase I, but the software for the host computer will be written in Phase II. It is hoped that this feasibility study will lead to the first commercially available SCA for use in academic, industrial, and government laboratories.",

The classical Eaton synthesis to yield cubane 1,4-dicarboxylic acid in five steps involves a key photochemical reaction. The steps before and after the critical 2+2 cycloaddition are standardized and readily scalable. However, this steps alone prevents scale-up. We will develop a non-photochemical method for this step. We propose three chemical alternatives: a) radical cation 2+2 cycloaddition via a radical chain process, b) a cobalt catalyzed 2+2 cyclodimerization and c) a nucleophilic addition-cyclization route. Rapid analysis for the success in non-photochemical reaction of the chemical 2+2 is easily done because the properties of the product are already known. Therefore during the six month period of Phase I we will start a screening of many one-electron oxidants for radical cation formation (route a), exhaustively vary reaction parameters for the cobalt catalyzed cyclodimerization, (route b) and investigate a representative number of nucleophiles capable of triggering the intramolecular cyclization in route c.",

A protein conjugate will be used for monoclonal catalytic antibody production. A key element of the hapten is that it is a phosphorane (pentacoordinate phosphorus) and contains the CF3PCH3 group. The synthesis depends upon new chemistry which we have discovered for phosphoranes and trifluoromethyl phosphorus compounds. The highly electronegative CF3 mimics an anionic oxygen bond to phosphorus and also stabilizes the phosphorane hapten towards hydrolytic decomposition. This novel hapten represents a closely proximate model for the transition state in organophosphate hydrolytic cleavage and should enable production of a highly effective catalytic antibody for organophosphate neutralization. The project is a collaborative effort between Steroids, Ltd which will do the synthesis, conjugation and haptn-protein ratio determination, and USAMRICD with will generate monoclonal catalytic antibodies and determine their activity towards hydrolytic cleavage of soman.",

Improved crack detection and material property measurement techniques are required to support the development and verification of material systems. A development program is proposed that will improve for high-temperature application two thermography techniques to enable the quantification of flaws both in terms of geometry and stress intensity factors. Forced Diffusion Thermography(FDT)is an NDE method that uses projected, dynamic patterns of light to thermally excite a specimen structure with an oscillating thermal pattern that is synchronously imaged and processed for the detection of flaws. Thermoelastic Stress Analysis(TSA)is a differential thermography technique capable of nearly real-time measurement of mixed-mode stress intensity factors. Both FDT and TSA use the same dynamic thermography equipment to measure the small temperature fluctuations upon which these techniques are based. FDT and TSA have serveral attributes that will make them superior to other methods for assessing structural integrity in extreme environments. FDT and TSA are noncontacting full-field techniques, not significantly impaired by convection currents or other anomalies ina high-temperature environment, able to work on a wide range of materials and composities, and able to produce standard(DC)thermal images as well as differential(AC)thermal images",

A NEW TECHNIQUE OF DEVELOPING A CONTINUOUS, BUILT-IN NIOBIUM (NB) COATING ON THE SURFACE OF A SUPERCONDUCTING WIRE WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE MANUFACTURE OF NB3SN MULTIFILAMENTARY SUPERCONDUCTING STRANDS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL THERMONUCLEAR EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR (ITER) PROJECT IN ORDER TO SIMULTANEOUSLY LIMIT THE INTERSTRAND EDDY CURRENT LOSSES IN A SUPERCONDUCTING CABLE AND PROTECT THE COPPER STABILIZER FROM RESIDUAL RESISTIVITY RATIO (RRR) DEGRADATION AFTER REACTION HEAT TREATMENT. THIS PROJECT DETAILS THE NECESSARY STEPS TO PROVIDE SUCH A SOLUTION. IN PHASE I THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS TECHNIQUE WILL BE EVALUATED GY FABRICATING A PROTOTYPE GRONZE-ROUTE NB-COATED NB3SN WIRE AND COMPARING JC AND RRR PERFORMANCE OF THIS WIRE WITH ITS COUNTERPART WIRE WITHOUT NB COATING. MOREOVER, THIS TECHNIQUE CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO THE MANUFACTURE OF INTERNAL-TIN ROUTE NB3SN, NIOBIUM-TITANIUM (NBTI) AND OTHER SUPERCONDUCTING WIRES.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Maintenance of Air Force turbine engines is hampered by threaded fasteners which have seized and cannot be removed, particularly in high-temperature turbine sections. Removal of these fasteners for routine maintenance often results in galled, seized or broken parts, with accompanying damage to the mating parts and lost maintenance time. This is very costly to the Air Force. Surfaces Research has developed new lubricant technology which promises to solve fastener lubricant problems. In the Phase I program, we will demonstrate improved antiseize fastener lubricant performance using new Surfaces Research lubricant technology. We will elucidate the chemical and metallurgical mechanisms which cause seizing the galling of fasteners in Air Force engines. We will establish the relationships between fastener lubricant performance in engines and in component screening tests.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Complexity has been shown to be a valid measure of software maintainability. However, software complexity measures are currently focused on the analysis of completed code. Since an improvement in the design phase of a software product would reduce the overall cost of that software (i.e., identify problems early in the software's life cycle), it only makes sense to develop a metric which addresses software design complexity. The ability to objectively evaluate and measure the design complexity of software would allow a software developer to evaluate and compare competing candidate designs prior to any coding activities. Comparing design early in the software design cycle would then permit an early evaluation of the anticipated maintainability (and quality) of the final software product. The objective of this SBIR activity is to identify appropriate software design complexity methods for an eventual development of an automated tool which identifies and measures software design complexity. With the adherence to emerging standards and interoperability with other Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools, a fully developed Avionics Software Design Complexity Measure (ASDCM) would certainly be a desireable feature of a modern Software Engineering Environment.",

A program of rational drug design to develop non-peptide NPY analogs for intervention in these disorders would be facilitated by a structural model of the NPY binding site. The construction of such a model requires an understanding of the molecular interac- tions between NPY peptide ligands and their receptors. We will generate an interactive molecular model of the NPY receptor/ligand complex. The model will be tested by structurally modifying cloned NPY1 receptors using site-directed mutagenesis, and assessing the impact of these changes on the pharmacology of the receptors when expressed in heterologous cell lines. Results of these mutagenesis experiments will be used to further refine our model of NPY receptors and map their ligand binding sites. The models ability to simulate docking of proposed drug designs with their receptor targets will allow us, in Phase II, to expand our structure function studies of the NPY system and accelerate our design of lead compounds to rapidly develop therapeutically useful non-peptide analogs of NPY.",

This device-called the I1000-includes an area imager (silicon retina), two single-layer analog neural networks and digital control. It appears possible to extend the I1000 architecture to create a single chip capable of recognizing simple objects. This device-called ORC-will have electrically programmable parameters so that it can be tailored to the recognition of user-defined objects. The parameters are learned off-line in a computer systems simulating the ORC neural networks, but receiving actual images produced by the ORC silicon retina. The ORC will recognize objects despite some variation in scale, orientation, and shape of the objects. The basic objective of this research effort is to define the specific architecture of the ORC and assess its technological feasibility. The ultimate objective is to be able to produce a cost-effective general-purpose object recognizer for commercial and military applications.",

Historically there are many submarine applications for readily available commercial electronics equipment. However, most commercial electronics equipment will not survive and provide the desired performance in the rigorous submarine environment. The cost of adapting commercial electronics equipment to the submarine environment is very expensive and in some cases prohibitive. The development of an innovative low-cost universal submarine electronics equipment packaging alternative to the repackaging approach currently applied to commercial electronics equipment will provide for cost effective submarine adaptation of commercial electronics equipment.

The components include the aircraft mathematical model, enviromental models, the simulator visual system, the motion system, the cockpit, associated computers, and component integration. A systematic study is proposed to quantify the minimum levels of fidelity required for each factor associated with simulating the rotorcraft/ship landing task. Rotorcraft/shipboard landing simulation fidelity will be evaluated in terms of fleet pilot training and in terms of supporting and eventually largely supplanting the dynamic interface (DI) flight testing performed by the Naval Air Test Center (NATC). The Phase I technical objective is to determine the minimum set and fidelity of simulation cues required for helicopter shipboard landing training and for developing DI launch/recovery envelopes. This objective will be accomplished in three tasks: (1) review and document previous work to quantify the level of fidelity of rotorcraft/ship landing simulatons, (2) consider the overall task and evaluate the individual factors that make up each component of the simulation task, and (3) develop a proposal to quantify in Phase II the required fidelity of the individual factors that make up each component of the rotorcraft/ship landing task.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Development of advanced flight control laws for aircraft is outpacing the evolution of the military flying qualities specifications. The use of task-tailored designs and extended flight envelopes has resulted in aircraft whose characteristics are on, or beyond, the edges of applicability of the current military standard for flying qualities of piloted airplanes. In addition, while the standard is comprehensive in scope, it is possible that external factors will influence the mission suitability of any aircraft design such that its overall flying qualities may be unacceptable, even if it passes individual criteria. The only final check of this suitability is via testing through a series of demonstration maneuvers. The proposed effort will review current flight testing and research methods to identify a limited set of maneuvers that will serve as a check of an aircraft's overall flying qualities. These maneuvers will be representative of actual flight mission elements and will include expected limits of desired and adequate performance, as required for flying-qualities evaluation. Unlike the single-axis, single-parameter criteria of the military standard, they will assure multi-axis operations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Replicated Shared-Memory Network (SMN) and fiber-optic (FO) communications technology has been used for several years as the means to configure multiple computational nodes into real-time simulation systems. In most cases these simulations were within a single facility, with node-to-node distances constrained 300 meters. The use of high-power laser diodes and/or higher-power laser transmitters and receivers to extend node-to-node distance by one or two orders of magnitude (to over 30,000 meters) and the use of satellite communications to extend these distances to geographically significant distances are a natural extension of replicated shared-memory networks. SYSTRAN's SCRAMNet (Shared Common RAM Network) product currently includes \"Long-Link\" laser diode boosters for internode distances approaching 3,500 meters. The Avionics Wind Tunnel (AWT), an ongoing plan to connect several Wright-Patterson AFB facilities within the Flight Dynamics and Avionics Directorates, and potentially other Area B facilities, requires additional capability in order to share U.S. Government classified data in a manner approved by the National Security Agency (NSA). SYSTRAN is aware of several techniques and products that can either: (i) protect this original data while it is being transmitted (without using time consuming and data generating encryption/decryption methods), or (ii) encrypt and decrypt the data. Both techniques offer advantages and limitations for AWT real-time requirements. This SBIR program will evaluate alternative methods to protect and/or to encrypt/decrypt shared memory network communications traffic using NSA-approved algorithms/devices.",

We understand that WL/AAAS has real-time network requirements across several domains - data, voice, video, and RF. SYSTRAN is pleased that all SCRAMNet (Shared Common RAM Network) is being considered as the real-time network solution for the \"data\" domain. During the last seven years, SYSTRAN has successfully transferred the underlying technology used in SCRAMNet - Shared Memory Network (SMN) technology (developed by WL/AA) - into a successful commercial product. As part of our participation in, and contribution to, many SMN applications, SYSTRAN designers and engineers have become extremely knowledgeable about the entire family of network technologies. There are several emerging networking technologies. FFOL (FDDI Follow ON LAN), FC (Fibre Channel), SCI (Scalable Coherent Interface), and ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) are the leading technologies to date. Choosing the right network for the future is difficult because of the many options. SYSTRAN offers to WL/AAAS their experience in mapping the needs of the Lab against the best emerging network technologies. We believe that the use of ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) switch technology provides the optimum solution to AWT gigabit video communication requirements, such as complex and sophisticated simulations including real-time intelligence in the cockpit. Our Phase I program will provide WL/AAAS with the best options and alternatives for gigabit network communications with the AWT (and throughout Bldg 620 and WPAFB, Area B).",

These materials have physical and chemical properties which make them interesting candidates for use as electrodes in high energy density electrolytic capacitors. Among the properties of interest are electrical conductivity, chemical stability, and themal stability. In this proposal we will explore the feasibility of adapting catalyst preparation techniques to produce a laboratory prototype capacitor based on HSA molybdenum nitride anodes. High surface area molybdenum nitride anodes will be prepared via the topotactic reaction of the oxide with NH3 . The dielectric oxide layers will be formed by anodization and solid electrolytes will be used in the Phase I laboratory prototype. Electrical evaluation will include determination of capacitance, effective series resistance, leakage current, energy storage density, and temperature stability. During the course of this research the materials will also be examined to determine their surface areas (gas absorption), surface moiphologies (SEM), and film thicknesses (Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy). The Phase II program will emphasize materials optimization and packaging design.",

For electro-optic modulators, polymer-based devices can gave large electro-optic coefficients, small dispersion, larger frequency response, and greater fabrication flexibility compared to titanium indiffused LiNbO3 or GaAs waveguide technology. Throughout the work we will emphasize the design of nonlinear optical materials which simultaneously address multiple requirements such as waveguide formation and optical nonlinearity. We will evaluate new materials for properties such as nonlinear optical (Pockels') coefficients, indices of refraction, optical absorption, optical scattering, photobleaching index of refraction change, RF dielectric constant, as well as chemical stability, mechanical properties, and thermal properties. We will also determine the suitability of various candidate polymers for application to external modulation devices. This determination will concern materials handling and processing, damage threshold, environmental stability, and service life. A prototype modulator will be constructed and tested to demonstrate the use of multifunctional polymers materials for optical modulation and analog data links during Phase II. The use of multifunctional polymer materials will provide improved frequency response (potentially to 100 GHz), larger electro-optic effect, large damage threshold, lower cost, and greater manufacturing flexibility.",

This technology is based on the development of wavelength-stable semiconductor diode lasers. With the proposed technology the wavelengths of these diode lasers are precisely determined and controlled by a temperature-stable Bragg reflector that provides strongly wavelength-selective reflection. Unlike standard Distributed Bragg Reflection (DBR) lasers, our approach uses a Bragg reflector that is made of a different material than the gain portion of the laser and separated from the gain region. Moreover, our Bragg reflectors are formed from glasses which are chosen for their superior temperature stability. Thus the laser emission wavelength is locked to a predetermined value. With this approach optimized and well-developed diode lasers may be combined with optimized Bragg reflectors. There are numerous applications of this technology. For example, in the communications arena our approach can provide hundreds of non-interfering wavelengths for dense wavelength division multiplexing. The development of this technology will give U.S. industry a lead in semiconductor laser technology that is now dominated by Japan.",

As a method to enhance the power levels and efficiency of the engine, the thermal emissivity of the outer anode surface must be substantially enhanced. Ideally, the anode material should be low density, both highly electrically and thermally conductive, and be chemically compatible with the reactive propulsion gases. The proposed research will investigate anode materials fabricated from directionally aligned carbon/carbon (C/C) composite. The inside surfaces of the plenum chamber, constrictor throat, and expansion nozzle will be coated with a layer of conductive tungsten metal to serve as the arc attachment surface and to protect the C/C composite surface will also ensure effective radiation of the heat flux generated by the arcjet plasma.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In the next generation of air-breathing high-performance engines, significant engine performance improvements are envisioned by combusting hydrogen with air in a regeneratively cooled carbon/carbon composite combustion chamber. Surfaces subjected to aerodynamic heating will also be cooled by recirculating hydrogen through cooling tubes. To date, approaches investigated have not had desired levels of heat transfer. In the Phase I program, two approaches to providing high heat transfer between cooling tubes and the C/C composite will be investigated. In the first, holes machined in the composite will be lined with a refractory metal liner using a proprietary process which provides good bonding between the metal liner and the composite. The process should completely fill any cracks or pores in the C/C composite. In the second approach, metal alloy tubes will be placed in refractory metal lined holes in the C/C composite. The gap between the tubes and the lined holes will be filled with copper or other non-reactive brazing metal. Filling the gap with high-conductivity metal should increase heat transfer to desired levels. Samples will be tested for hydrogen leakage, resistenace to thermal cycling and resistance to high heat fluxes. The data developed in Phase I will lead to the design and operation of a prototype heat exchanger in Phase II.",

The primary focus of this proposed Phase I program is to develop the design of a thermal battery that call tolerate high power drain and yield exceedingly high power density. The proposed Phase I program objectives are oriented towards developing exceedingly thin wafers for electrodes and salt separator matrix. Using novel cathodes, the feasibility of the thermal battery system for the expendable sonobuoy application at the cell stack level will be established. The proposed Phase I program consists of studying a number of cathodes and processing of thin electrode and salt wafers. Based upon this study, a cell stack will be designed and fabricated. Finally, the electrochemical evaluation of the cell-stack will be performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the high power density thermal battery, > 10 kW^ . Successful completion of this program will form the basis for a Phase B program in which design, fabrication and testing of a battery prototype is envisaged.",

Beginning late in FY93, the Navy expects to accomplish the removal and disposal of the napalm and the aluminum canisters. When this task is completed, all that will remain are the 35,000 PCP treated wood crates in various states of disrepair. This amounts to approximately six million pounds of waste that must be disposed of properly. Because of current State regulations and pending regulatory changes at the Federal level, careful consideration must be given to disposal of PCP-treated wood products. TA&T;, Inc. proposes to demonstrate in Phase I, a safe, low cost and rapid chemical catalyst technique for decontamination of PCP-treated wood. The technique is called Base Catalyzed Decompisition and has already been demonstrated to decontaminate PCP contaminated soil, as well as PCB contaminated wood. Based on these demonstrations, the extension of this technique to decontamination of PCP-treated wood has a high probability of success.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         (U) The advent of technology (e.g., GaAs MMIC amplifiers and DRFM devices) has enhanced the development of inexpensive expendable repeater/transponder jammers that can mimic an airborne radar's signal coherently, and modulate it to deceive, confuse or obfuscate the radar/receiver, effectively preventing it from achieving or maintaining track lock-on, thus delaying or precluding missile launch. The proliferation and availability of these inexpensive active expendables throughout the world makes them a viable threat to US airborne intercept (AI) radars. (U) Technology Service Corporation (TSC) proposes to assess two ECCM techniques to counter the effects of ECM signals generated by active expendables during an airborne radar track mode, while minimizing the impact on the radar system. The two techniques--Target Modulated ECCM (TAME) and Multiple Target Angular Resolution (MTAR) complement each other--and together will counter ECM wave forms expected from active expendables in general, and towed decoys in particular. TAME (a TSC-proprietary technique) is primarily effective against coherent repeater signals (false targets or pulloffs), but not against narrowband repeater doppler noise; whereas MTAR is most effective against narrowband repeater doppler noise, as well as against repeater signals in the same resolution cell as the protected target (i.e., prior to pulloff). (U) Phase I study tasks consist of assessing current and postulated future ECM parameters of active expendable jammers, developing the ECCM algorithms, and analyzing the ECCM techniques performance and feasibility. A plan to test the ECCM techniques via simulation during Phase II will be developed during Phase I.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Custom design parts for sophisticated Air Force weapon systems are produced in small batches, where the design and plan process account for a large percentage of the development and production time. The production cost per part is higher for single or batch production when compared to mass production. In batch production, the machining time does not account for a large percentage of the total time for designing, planning, and production. Therefore, for cost optimization, it is more important to cut down the planning time by quickly generating a feasible process plan rather that the lengthy generation of an optimized plan. The emphasis is on short turnaround time for immediate prototyping. For mass production it is important to optimize the process plan to minimize the machining time. The proposal objectives are to automate the design and manufacture plan of custom parts by developing a concurrent engineering system with geometrical reasoning engine, for integrated design, part specifications, and process planning. In Phase I, the architectures of the system will be completed. A limited prototyping system will be developed. In Phase II, the system development will be completed and tested in real production. Also, a plan to commercialize the system will be prepared.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         1The various departments of defense possess explosives and propellants produced since 1948. The stability of these old explosives and propellants are in question and the Army is required to dispose these explosives. The total amount of obsolete explosives is around 300 million tons and increasing every year. These can be disposed of by burning using the Open Pad Burning Method which is virtually been abolished by the EPA and alternate mehtods such as the incinerator have been proposed. Current incinerator systems can handle only 0.5 lbs/hr of explosives because they contain to much. Currently extraction mehtodology for demilitarization of propellants and explosives use carcinogenic hydrocarbon solvents, are time consuming, insufficiently sensitive, labor intensive and costly. Besides, bydrocarbon solvents are expensive, require vacuum distillation to remove the solvent from the extracted compounds, and the plant has to explosion proof. A new process, safe to personnel, meeting both OSHA and EPA requirements, using inexpensive solvent, not requiring explosion proof plant would be very useful in the demilitarization of the explosives and save the government considerable amount of money. The proposed research seeks to apply supercritical fluid technology to extract and separate energetic materials, stabilizers and non-polymerics from propellants and explosives.",

Thermacore has successfully designed, fabricated, and tested four FHPCP geometries for four difference aircraft applications. The results, compiled in a report and submitted to the Naval Air Development Center, demonstrated the FHPCP's versatility and capacity for cooling. The report also indicated that substantial progress had been made towards qualifying the FHPCP for aircraft use; however, additional tests were recommended to complete this work. The suspected weakness (and area of needed testing) of the original FHPCP design was performance under adverse high-g loading and adverse elevation. A CPL design features inherently improved performance under these adverse conditions; consequently, the proposed program would use a CPL design to improved the FHPCP's performance and possibly qualify the advanced design for aircraft use. In addition, the program would pursue additional aircraft cooling applications as well as investigate lighter materials of construction.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         2D real-time phased array ultrasound has become a dominant medical imaging modality due to low costs, high efficacy and the absence of ionizing radiation. The total worldwide market for diagnostic ultrasound is $2 billion annually. Real-time phased array volumetric scanning systems (often called \"4D Ultrasound Systems\") promise an array of enhanced diagnostic capabilities; therefore, they will replace 2D phased array ultrasound as the dominant ultrasound modality. We own the patent (Figure 1) for the only known effective mechanism for implementing our images, i. e., receive mode parallel processing. We will develop a commercial fully featured scalable real time phased array volumetric scanner. The basis for this machine will be the real time phased array volumetric scanner at Duke University (the only known real time volumetric scanner in the world). Phase I of this research is directed toward the design, construction, and testing of a unique phased array receiver system based upon a custom VLSI mixed signal delay line chip. The verification of adequate performance of this system in terms of signal to noise, dynamic range, linearity, signal delay, power consumption, size and cost is essential prior to the design and construction of the complete real time volumetric imaging system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         There are four key elements to the successful design and ultimate deployment of an acoustic underwater communications system for IUSS/ASW tactical connectivity. First, the properties and limitations of the undersea environment must be understood and characterized. Second, the communications link design must provide robust and efficient performance in the presence of the highly variable undersea environment. Third, the offered connectivity, data rates, and reliability must provide tactical utility without significant degradation of prime ASW sensor capabilities. Fourth, maximum utilization of existing and planned subsystems already present or planned for installation must be a key element of the overall design, and additional component development, production, and installation cost should be modest, so that the overall system is affordable. The proposed approach incorporates all the above elements. Characteristics of the communication function include bandspreading, multipath resistance, error correction, and higher data rates for links with benign acoustic conditions. The Phase I effort will survey the operational and planned ASW platform and IUSS resources, design and overall acoustic communications system including operational concept and connectivities, model and analyze link performance accounting for the detailed acoustic environment, and design the acoustic transceiver capable of performing as required for the communications system.",

A TRS system is proposed which would utilize small (shirt-pocket size or less), light weight, low power consumption terminals with omni-directional antennas. The system should provide position location to better than 25 meters anywhere over land or ocean. Terminals would be capable of 2-way data communications, would be inexpensive (many may be lost or non-recoverable) and would have a battery life goal of 36 to 48 hours minimum. Such a system would also include a second version of the terminal for use by law enforcement officers. This terminal would contain a small readout LCD display and a keyboard for sending short messages in the field or to the tactical control and monitoring center. The officer's terminal would have an emergency button to immediately transmit an officer-in-trouble message with a location.",

SEVERAL TECHNIQUES ARE CURRENTLY IN USE WHICH APPROACH THE PROBLEM BY DISCRETIZING EITHER THE SCENARIO REGION OR THE ROUTE OF THE AIRCRAFT.

THIS APPROACH HAS THE ADVANTAGE THAT THE DYNAMICS OF THE AIRCRAFT ARE EXPLICITLY MODELED IN THE PROBLEM FORMULATION SO THAT IT WILL ALWAYS PRODUCE FEASIBLE ROUTES.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The DESERT STORM experience generated a sudden and intense interest in tactical missile launchers. Our impotence in finding and destroying these launchers soon became obvious to us as well as the rest of the world. Later it became apparent that we also lacked the analysis tools needed to investigate and develop effective responses to missile launcher and other Critical Mobile Targets (CMTs). A three-phase program is described here for developing a simulation tool which an be used by the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) to investigate candidate approaches and perform tradeoff studies to develop the requirements for airborne platforms capable of countering mobile missile launchers and other CMTs. The simulation will use the same innovative approach applied by Toyon in support of DARPA's sensor development efforts, but will be structured to focus on the issues relevant to sensor platforms rather than sensors. Phase I, the principal subject of this proposal, will focus on demonstrating the feasibility of creating the desired simulation. Phase II, as a follow-on to Phase I, will proceed with full-scale development of a complete and user-friendly simulation which ASC can use to explore the tradeoffs between various platforms and the relevant parameters for countering CMTs. A final phase, funded by commercial interests, would make further refinements in the simulation, possibly including the creation of new versions which could be hosted on other types of machines of interest to industry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Although the wideband, narrow beam radars at KMR are capable of tracking well-behaved targets during reentry, the radars do not reliably maintain track on targets whose drag profiles deviate significantly from a priori predictions. The objective of this effort is to determine the feasibility of augmenting existing tracking filters for the KMR radars to allow real-time computation, correction, ad prediction of reentry drag experienced by objects in track. The existing KMR track filters attempt to compensate for drag excursions by increasing the process noise when predictions are observed to deviate from the measurements. Rather than simply increase the process noise, our proposed approach is to use the observed deviations between the predicted and observed measurements to modify/improve on our a priori estimate of vehicle drag profile. Our approach can be described as one of using drag as an additional state variable which is estimated in real time using the predictor/corrector processes of Kalman filtering. A digital simulation will be used to refine our new algorithm and to compare its performance with the existing KMR track filters for a wide spectrum of drag profiles. Feasibility of the revised tracker will be evaluated in terms of its ease of implementation in the existing rel-time programs of the KMR radars, and the ability of the existing computing hardware to absorb the additional computational load.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Disposal of surplus explosives is a major problem due to lack of storage space, environmental restrictions on OB/OD, and expected increase in active program retirements due to military downsizing. Military use of reclaimed explosives is an attractive alternative, with major cost benefits, but is inhibited by current material specifications and general concerns over material performance. An investigation into processes for the reclamation of bulk explosives and explosive constituents will be conducted. Reclaimed materials will be characterized with respect to physical, chemical, thermal stability, and sensitivity characteristics. Applications for use of reclaimed bulk explosives and explosive constituents within the military will be identified. Material requirements for such use applications will be quantified and compared with material characterization information. Procedures to establish a qualification methodology will be formulated and military use development program will be outlined; both to be accomplished in Phase II. TPL is active in commercial uses of demilitarized explosives and propellants. It has proposed one military use for reclaimed PBX and conducted preliminary testing to evaluate performance capabilities. Its in-house chemistry expertise will support extraction studies. CETR will provide thermal stability and sensitivity testing support. Combined, the team has all the capabilities to achieve the desired objective.",

During the Phase I program, we will define and investigate the requireioents for such a microclimate passive body undergarioent that would contain no having or active components. With proper selection of PCMs contained within a series of packets in a well-designed vest or undergarment, sufficient heating or cooling can be provided for satisfactory comfort of individual soldiers and periait unpowered and individual rejuvenation without refrigeration.

        "abstract": "Abstract         A novel approach to agile manufacturing for production of metal matrix composites (MMC) is proposed. The composites are precision cast by pressurized infiltration casting. Thin-walled ceramic molds are used to contain and infiltrate complex-shaped preforms. A powerful, user-friendly 3D graphics software package is used to interactively create mold designs from the solid model of MMC component to be cast. The software can also analyze the casting process in transient 3D to simulate mold filling. A rapid prototyping method directly creates ceramic molds from the CAD-generated solid model, eliminating intervening steps and part-specific tooling. This increased flexibility allows for rapid design changes, dramatically reducing the cost and lead time involved in casting MMC's. Computer integrated manufacturing incorporating rapid prototyping will establish pressure infiltration casting as a new paradigm for affordable and timely manufacturing of near-net shape metal matrix composites and components. The proposed effort will demonstrate enabling technology by fabricating near-net shape Gr/Al heatsinks for Naval avionics applications.",

The system is called the Mobile Ordnance Disrupter System (MODS). The current design requires a clear line-of-sight from the vehicle to the ordnance, and thus is ineffective against munitions in depressions, behind obscurations or in buildings. A fiber optic beam delivery system (FOBD) offers an alternative approach in these cases. However, in its present state of development, FOBD is not suitable for MODS, due principally to problems with fiber damage, power loss, and output beam formation. This study will focus on assessing currently available technologies, and identifying additional requirements to overcome these deficiencies, so that a FOBD system for MODS becomes technically and economically feasible. Propagation of high power laser radiation through optical fibers of various types and sizes will be evaluated through mathematical modelling and laboratory experiments. The current state-of-the-art on other components of FOBD will be assessed. Low loss transmission of energy from a 1000 CW Nd:YAG laser through a FOBD system will be demonstrated. Other potential applications of FOBD in the MODS vehicle will be evaluated.",

A post-deposition consolidation will be used to fabricate MMC's directly from the matrix-containing fibers. This fabrication route offers the following advantages: (a) a very clean environment with excellent impurity control, (b) good repeatability/reproducibility, (c) control of matrix volume fraction, primarily through control of matrix coating thickness, (d) control over chemistry and homogeneity of the deposited matrix, (e) uniform fiber distribution, (f) lower processing temperatures, and (g) flexibility in fiber-matrix interface control/design. The specific objectives of the Phase I effort are: (1) to demonstrate the potential of the sputter deposition process for obtaining highly controlled, uniform, adherent deposits of the titanium aluminide alloy, Ti-22Al-23Nb, on short-length SiC fibers, (2) to demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining MMC's by consolidation of the matrix-containing fibers, (3) to demonstrate proof-of-concept through microstructural studies, thermal cycling and room temperature tensile tests on the fabricated MMC's, (4) to develop a conceptual and engineering design of a reel-to-reel coating system for deposition of matrix alloys on continuous fibers, and (5) provide a comparative cost analysis of the proposed technique in relation to conventional MMC manufacturing processes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Army is one of the major users of Li batteries, as they are reliable, have high energy density and shelf life. Present lithium systems are not safe and require special care and caution by the user. An Ultra-safe, high rate, high energy density Li/Mn02 cell packaged in soft pouch material is being proposed for development of BA-5590/U cell. This new system is safe, low cost and has potential to replace all of the present primary cells/batteries used by the Army. A phase I program to prove the feasibility of BA-5590/U cell with Li/Mn02 chemistry and U.B.I.'s patented safety separator, and package with a soft pouch material is proposed. During this progra, work will focus on hermetic sealing, manufacturing process and fabrication of high rate cathode. Also, assembled cells will be evaluated for electrical performance and safety. U.B.I is uniquely qualified to conduct this program, as we have in place manufacturing process necessary for manufacture of Li/Mn02 batteries and owns a safety-shutdown spearator process. During phase II, U.B.I. will fabricate BA-5590/U cells and assemble them in to a battery, then evaluate battery for electrical performance and prove use of Li/MN02 chemistry and soft pouch packaging material to replace present chemistry. An Ultra-safe, high rate, high energy density battery with low cost is desirable to Army to reduce thier cost without sacrificing safety, reliability and performance.",

THEY ARE AN EXCELLENT MATERIAL FOR CARBIDE CUTTING TOOLS AND OTHER WEAR- AND/OR CORROSION-RESISTANT PARTS, HAVING BETTER MECHANICAL PROPERTIES DUE TO THEIR FINER GRAIN SIZE THAN TYPICAL CARBIDE TOOLS (20-50 MICRONS). HOWEVER, SOME OF THEIR POTENTIAL ADVANTAGE IS LOST BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF HANDLING SUCH FINE POWDERS AND MIXING THEM WITH COBALT AND NICKEL POWDERS TO FORM THE BLEND WHICH IS THEN PREFORMED AND SINTERED. PROBLEMS THAT ARISE DURING HANDLING AND BLENDING INCLUDE INCREASED IMPURITY CONTENT, NONHOMOGENEOUS DISTRIBUTION OF MATRIX POWDERS, AND WC-WC PARTICLE CONTACT, ALL OF WHICH CAUSE LOWERED MECHANICAL PROPERTIES IN THE FINISHED PART. THE RESULT IS THAT HIGHER COBALT CONTENTS MUST BE INCORPORATED TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED FRACTURE TOUGHNESS AND TRANSVERSE RUPTURE STRENGTH, WITH A CONSEQUENT DECREASE IN TOOL HARDNESS LIFE. PHASE I WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF COATING EACH INDIVIDUAL WC GRAIN WITH THE PROPER THICKNESS OF COBALT MATRIX MATERIAL SO THAT, AFTER CONSOLIDATION, THE PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM POWDER BLENDING (ESPECIALLY WC-WC PARTICLE CONTACT AND CARBIDE FORMATION) WILL BE MINIMIZED OR ELIMINATED. THIS WILL NOT ONLY IMPROVE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND PERFORMANCE OVER CONVENTIONAL MICROGRAIN CARBIDES, BUT ALSO PERMIT FASTER CONSOLIDATION TIMES WITH LOWER IMPURITY CONTENTS AND LESS DELETERIOUS INTERACTION BETWEEN THE MATRIX AND CARBIDE. A LARGE REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF COBALT REQUIRED IS ALSO EXPECTED.",

THREE BASIC STEPS ARE REQUIRED FOR SENSOR OPERATION: MEMBRANE EQUILIBRATION OF GASEOUS AND AQUEOUS CO2, CHEMICAL AMPLIFICATION OF THE CONCENTRATION OF THE IONIZED BYPRODUCTS OF CO2 DISSOLUTION, AND SPECIFIC CONDUCTANCE DETECTION. ATMOSPHERIC CO2 EQUILBRATES ACROSS A MICROPOROUS HYDROPHOBIC MEMBRANE WITH AN AQUEOUS PHASE ACCORDING TO HENRY'S LAW. DISSOLVED AQUEOUS CO2 THEN UNDERGOES IONIZATION FORMING CONDUCTIVE SPECIES FOLLOWING THE DISSOCIATION EQUILIBRIA. THIS IONIZATION PROCESS IS CHEMICALLY AMPLIFIED IN A RECIRCULATING AQUEOUS LOOP, USING WATER SOLUBLE ALKANOLAMINES WHICH REVERSIBLY REACT WITH CO2, PRODUCING CONDUCTIVITY CHANGES CORRESPONDING TO THE ATMOSPHERIC CO2 PARTIAL PRESSURE FLUCTUATIONS. THESE CHANGES ARE DETECTED USING EXISTING FLOWTHROUGH CONDUCTIVITY MEASURING DEVICES. THE PLANNED SENSOR OFFES SEVERAL ADVANTAGES INCLUDING ACCURACY OVER THE RANGE OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2 PARTIAL PRESSURES, LOW UNIT COST, AND LOW WEIGHT AND POWER REQUIREMENTS. THE SYSTEM IS ALSO EXPECTED TO BE RESISTANT TO BIOFOULING AND INSENSITIVE TO THE EFFECTS OF STRONG RELATIVE MOTION. ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGES INCLUDE SIMPLICITY, RELIABILITY, EASE OF USE, EASE OF CALIBRATION, EASE OF AUTOMATION, OPERABILITY OVER A WIDE TEMPERATURE RANGE, AND CAPABILITY FOR UNATTENDED OPERATION FOR PERIODS OF UP TO ONE YEAR.

SINCE DYNAMIC PATTERNS OF ELECTROTACTILE STIMULATION CAN REPRODUCE IMPORTANT PROPERTIES OF OPTICAL STIMULATION, WHICH THEMSELVES CAN SUPPORT USEFUL PERCEPTUAL DESCRIPTIONS OF 3-SPACE AND EVENTS, IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH REPRODUCTIONS LEAD TO SUCCESSFUL PERCEPTION AND ACTION IN 3-SPACE BY THE BLIND. THE PHASE I RESEARCH IS FOCUSED ON THE PREREQUISITE PERCEPTUAL-MOTOR CONTROL NECESSARY TO EXPLORE SUCH PROSPECTS MORE FULLY. THREE EXPERIMENTS ARE DESCRIBED. WE WILL EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH IMPORTANT PROPERTIES OF OPTIC FLOW (THE CHANGES IN OPTIC FIELD ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-MOVEMENT OR OBJECT MOTION) ARE DETECTED, INTERPRETED AND ACTED UPON IN REAL-TIME SITUATIONS. WE WILL EXAMINE THIS PERCEPTUAL-MOTOR CONTROL, AND ITS PROGRESS, WITH CONGENITALLY BLIND, ADVENTIOUSLY BLIND AND SIGHTED SUBJECTS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Auscultation of breath sounds during an aeromedical evacuation is unachievable because of the noisy environment. Thus patient care capability is diminished because diagnosis and timely intervention might be compromised. In an emergency situation, civil or military, the traditional ambulance and aircraft (helicopter & fixed wing) are the usual means of evacuating critically ill patients. While the enclosed clinical space of these vehicles is noisy, the helicopter cabin noise is usually loudest. Helicopter noise levels of 100 dB(A) are common while breath sounds (signals) have been measured at 30 dB(A) and frequency ranges are comparable. Improving auscultation in this environment presents unique and complex problems which require unique solutions. The R&D; effort demands a comprehensive investigation and understanding of the: (1) auscultation & diagnostic requirements, i.e., patient sound pathology (signals), (2) signal characteristics (frequency, amplitude), (3) noise interference characteristics, (4) method(s) for transmitting signals to the medic with maximum fiderlity. The principal Phase I objective is the design and demonstration of a bread-board model of the Auscultation Sensor & Telemetry Device (ASTD) in a simulated aeromedical evacuation environment (110 dB(A) noise level). Active & passive noise reduction technologies will be integrated into the design as necessary. UREA established alliances with consultants and companies that could best provide additional program suuport and diminish R&D; risks.",

Critical to the success of this effort is the consederation of each element's impact on other parts of the system relative to the shock hardening. Alternative approaches to the motor, gearing, and drive electronics, will be evaluated for their own merits as well as the impact on other components. The design we propose will meet the G load requirements by control of load paths, load distribution, and elimination of susceptible components. Versatron's proven experience in control system simulation and design will assure that the system proposed for phase II will meet all of it's performance goals. We have teamed with International Dynamics Corporation (IDC) for expertise in shock hardening. The phase I effort will emphasize design trade studies in the areas of cost, size, shock hardening attributes, motor size and type, electronics architecture, and the method of gear reduction. The result will be a detail design approach that integrates available technology to meet the technical requirements. The selected design will be analyzed in sufficient deatil to allow low risk detail design, fabrication, and testing in phase II.",

A successful Phase I feasibility Program leads directly to an SHF on-the-air Phase II Proof-of-concept demonstration, including measurements to verify Performance Predicted in Phase I. The high pay-off Phase II program is tailored for a Phase III opportunity to feed the Powerful networking equipment into mainstream SHF terminal Procurements. Our concept builds on ViaSat\\'s expertise in key technologies related to SHF networking, including: anti-jam, low Probability of exploitation signaling and coding, satcom modems, embedded-multi^user Time-of-Day encryption, and Demand Assigned Multiple Access network management.

Thousands of simultaneous users can be supported depending on the mix of users. Phase I results demonstrate in excess of 1000 simultaneous high bandwidth users can be supported. In addition, several thousand low bandwidth users can be supported. This approach is an adaptation of existing commercial messaging systems for marine applications. The proposed design uses existing Ku- band resources on a secondary basis. The spread spectrum signal processing provides an efficient method for minimizing the interference between secondary and primary Fixed Satellite Service users. Phase I will result in a detailed system architecture that can be implemented and demonstrated in Phase II. Phase I will also result in detailed size, weight, and power estimates for the candidate remote transceiver design.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Development of high power microwave (HPM) sources for Air Force applications requires cathodes with long usable lifetimes, negligible anode-cathode (A-K) gap closure, reproducible functioning under high repetition pulsing, uniform current density, and negligible plasma/current production from nearby surfaces. Cathodes must maintain such stable electron beam output characteristics for > 1 nsec. We propose to meet these requirements in an extremely low cost, robust carbon cathode with a matrix of carbon fiber tufts as the emitting surface. Innovations to improve performance include: cesium iodide coating to reduce plasma gap closure and improve current density uniformity; an intermediate electrode to reduce unwanted plasma production from nearby surfaces and increase total current; increased carbon tuft surface density to produce more uniform current density and reduce explosive plasma production; and a ballast resistor array behind the fibers to prevent hot spots of current/plasma production. Cathodes will be produced utilizing these novel features and tested on a crowbarred Marx for 1-2 nsec pulses. Using a corona bushing to eliminate edge effects, 5-cm radius cathodes will be tested with 4-cm A-K gaps up to the 150-200 kV range. Gap closure rates, current density uniformity, and field stress applied to cathode will be determined, and configuration optimized for meeting target performance goals.",

The same pair can also be employed to extract the angular rate component lying in a plane perpendicular to their common input axis by taking the difference in their outputs; which are affected equally but in opposite directions by the coriolis acceleration caused by the angular rate component. The development of an IMU design based upon this concept is the objective of the Phase I effort.",

The IMU sensor cluster design proposed is based upon the inertial silicon sensors produced by Waddan Systems. A pair of the silicon accelerometers are mounted together with their input axes coincident. Each is excited by an equal but opposite velocity normal to the input axes. This velocity has no effect on the acceleration sensed if the pair is put in a pure linear acceleration field, because each senses the same acceleration component. But when it is subjected to an angular rate normal to both the input axis and the velocity vector, the coriolis acceleration experienced by each is equal but opposite. Thus, by taking the sum and difference of the outputs of the devices one can measure both the linear acceleration and the angular rate. A minimum of three such pairs in a sensor cluster would yield a three axis IMU. The objective of the Phase I effort is to design an IMU which is analytically as well as technologically feasible for the 60 mm projectile application.",

Presently, there are many problems in joining these very dissimilar materials to form reliable and strong bonds. Most of these problems are related to large difference in their melting temperatures and with non-adherent oxides of the metals. For high-temperature applications, problems in the mismatch of their thermal expansion coefficients would also be quite serious. This proposed research will develop novel surface prosesses to address these problems, especially to reduce dynamic stresses generated during temperature fluctuations. Phase I will demonstrate and test the thermal stability and strength of joints made of SiC and diamond films to copper. Phase II will involve optimization of the processes in terms of uniformity, reliability, durability and cost effectiveness. Phase III will develop potential applications of electronic packaging in manufacturing and specific applications.",

SUCH A COMMERCIAL PACKAGE WOULD HELP STANDARDIZE THE REPORTING OF EPR RESULTS. WEB RESEARCH CO. HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE FOR MOSSBAUER SPECTROSCOPY AND MAGNETIZATION SATURATION. THAT SOFTWARE HAS MANY OF THE FEATURES DESIRED FOR THE EPR SOFTWARE. THE NEW EPR SOFTWARE WOULD INCLUDE THEORETICAL MODELS FOR SIMULATIONS OF CENTERS WITH ELECTRONIC SPIN S=1/2 OR S>1/2. ALSO, SUFFICIENT STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TOOLS WOULD BE INCLUDED TO ALLOW REALISTIC ESTIMATES OF THE UNCERTAINTIES OF AND CORRELATIONS BETWEEN FITTED PARAMETERS. OR SHORT-TERM (SBIR PHASE I) GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A PROTOTYPE PROGRAM AND HAVE IT EVALUATED BY AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT AND A RESEARCH GROUP. THE LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO PRODUCE AND SELL A COMMERCIAL VERSION THAT WOULD INCORPORATE EXTENSIVE HELP AND TUTORIAL FEATURES. SUCH FEATURES WOULD MAKE EPR ACCESSIBLE TO A BROADER RANGE OF CHEMISTS AND BIOCHEMISTS.",

OF COURSE, IMAGE PROCESSING AND DISPLAY ARE IMPORTANT, BUT THEYARE ULTIMATELY DEPENDENT ON A STRONG TRANSDUCER SIGNAL. ALTHOUGH ENHANCEMENTS ARE CONTINUALLY ADDED TO TRANSDUCER DESIGNS, THERE ARE LIMITS IMPLICIT IN THE CUSTOMARY EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN CYCLE. MANUFACTURERS SEE COMPUTER SIMULATION AS THE WAY TO ESCAPE THIS CYCLE AND EXTEND THE DESIGN LIMITS. A COMPREHENSIVE NUMERICAL SIMULATION CODE IS URGENTLY NEEDEDTO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT TRANSDUCER MODELS ANDHELP PROMOTE MORE EFFICIENT DESIGN METHODOLOGIES. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AND SELL SUCH A CODE TO THE ULTRASOUND COMMUNITY. THE CODE WILL PERMIT COMPLETE, THREE-DIMENSIONAL, TIME-DOMAIN FINITE ELEMENT MODELING OF TRANSIENT WAVES IN PIEZOELECTRIC-ELASTIC-ACOUSTIC MEDIA. ANEXISTING ELASTIC FINITE ELEMENT PROGRAM DEVELOPED BY WEIDLINGER ASSOCIATES SUPPLIES THE FRAMEWORK. THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE AN ADVANCED LEVEL OF SIMULATION BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF MODERN ALGORITHMS ALONG WITH THE POWERFUL WORKSTATIONS AND CAD RESOURCES AVAILABLE TODAY.

THE PROCESS AT PRESENT IS INEFFICIENT AND CONSEQUENTLY EXPENSIVE; THE END RESULT IS INFLATIONARY AND HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ABILITY OF THE UNITED STATESTO COMPETE IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE. IN ADDITION, TRAFFIC MOVING FROM MARINE TERMINALS TO A RAIL HEAD GENERALLY EXACERBATES EXISTING ROADWAY CONGESTION IN PORT AREAS AND IS THE SOURCE OF MUCH ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN. THE AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A MODEL TERMINAL AND IDENTIFY THE HARDWARE SOFTWARE AND MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES REQUIRED TO OPERATE IT BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF AN INTEGRATED MARINE/RAIL INTERMODAL OPERATION. BOTH VESSELS AND TRAINS WOULD JOINTLY EMPLOY SIMULTANEOUS DISCHARGE AND LOADING OPERATIONS USING A COMMON SITE TO EFFECT THE TRANSITION OF CONTAINERS TO AND FROM EACH MODE OF TRANSPORT. THIS METHOD WILL PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EFFICIENT AND PRODUCTIVE USE OF MARINE FACILITIES, ENABLING U.S. WEST COAST PORTS TO ACCOMMODATE TRAFFIC VOLUMES FOR THE FOR ESEEABLE FUTURE.

THE SYSTEM SHOULD INCLUDE INEXPENSIVE AND RELIABLE SENSORS CAPABLE OF INTERFACING WITH ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT. THIS RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF A PORTABLE FLOW MEASUREMENT SYSTEM. FOR OVER 50 YEARS, THE CONCEPT OF A COMBINATION VENTURI FLAME/VENTURI TUBE HAS BEEN KNOWN BUT OF LITTLE UTILITY. IMPEDIMENTS TO APPLICATION OF THE CONCEPT HAVE INCLUDED (1) INABILITY OF MEASURING FLOWS IN THE TRANSITION REGION BETWEEN OPEN CHANNEL AND FULL PIPE FLOW AND (2) UNAVAILABILITY OF INEXPENSIVE YET ACCURATE PRESSURE TRANSMITTING AND SENSING SUBASSEMBLIES APPROPRIATE FOR BOTH FLOW CONDITIONS. PREVIOUS RESEARCH BY YELLOWSTONE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE, INC. HAS SOLVED THE FIRST PROBLEM AND THIS RESEARCH WILL SOLVE THE SECOND. BASED ON AN ANAYLSIS OF PROMISING SENSING OPTIONS, A WORKING MODEL OF A PRESSURE TRANSMISSION/SENSING SUBASSEMBLY WILL BE FABRICATED. THE SUBASSEMBLY WILL UNDERGO STATIC AND DYNAMIC TESTING AT THE BENCH SCALE. LABORATORY-SCALE TESTING OF A COMPLETE WORKING MODEL OF THE PORTABLE FLOW MEASUREMENT SYSTEM WILL THEN BE CONDUCTED TO ASSESS SYSTEM ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY.",

THE CRITICAL SHEAR RATE IS DETERMINED BY MEASURING TOTAL STRESSES (DYNAMIC & PRESSURE) OF THE MATERIAL FLOWING AT CONSTANT FLOWRATE BUT AT DIFFERENT SHEAR RATES ACROSS THE DEVICE (SECTIONS), WHILE RETAINING DEFORMATION HISTORY AND ITS ASSOCIATED RHEOLOGICAL PARAMETERS SIMULTANEOUSLY WITHOUT INTERUPTION OF THE FLOW. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM IS SIMPLE AND HAS WELL DEFINED MATHEMATICS (FLOW EQUATIONS, STRESS/RATE RELATIONSHIPS, ETC.) WITHOUT ANY ASSUMPTION SUCH AS ENTRANCE EFFECTS. THE DEVICE CAN BE USED AS AN IN-LINE RHEOMETER/QUALITY CONTROL TOOL BY CONNECTING IT TO THE EXTRUDER DIE BLOCK (WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OF THE PRODUCT) OR AS A LAB INSTRUMENT. IT HAS NO MOVING OR ROTATING PARTS AND IS CONSIDERED TO BE VERY SAFE IN AN EXTRUSION LINE (EXPLOSIVE DOUGHS) EXPECIALLY FOR CLEANING LEFT OVER DOUGH WITHIN THE DEVICE.

The system will use the Projection-Moire concept, whereby a high-density line-set of Master Grating is projected on the investigated surface. The projected lines, deformed by the displacements and bending of the investigated surface is then optically recombined with a reference set, producing the Moire Fringe pattern. As operational system will be assembled and testing will be conducted to prove the feasibility of the proposed approach. The designed system will include a projection master and a PC-controlled CCD camera to receive the image, and produce the Moire fringes, using software generated reference grating. Software will be developed to analyze the fringe pattern, retrieving the displacement and stress information.",

MUCH OF THE CD METHODS HAVE NOT BEEN APPLIED TO IRFPA/EO DEVELOPMENT PROCESS DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF THE INTER-PROCESS MODEL AND SIMULATION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I PROGRAM IS TO IDENTIFY AND DESIGN A SET OF ANALYTICAL AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED MODELS AND SIMULATIONS THAT IS KEY TO THE CD OF A GENERIC FAMILY OF IRFPA/EO SYSTEMS. THE IRFPA/EO DEVELOPER WILL HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DETERMINE (A) THE PRODUCIBILITY OBSTACLES IMPOSED BY MATERIAL AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND (B) THE WAYS TO ADJUST SYSTEM DESIGN AND PRODUCTION TO BE CONSISTENT WITH CRITICAL IRFPA/EO TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT.",

The result will be the first general purpose, commercially available, space mission utility simulator. It will run on available workstations and will allow the user to quantify mission performance as a function of system design, scenarios, and environmental parameters. The user will be able to rapidly estimate under what conditions and how well overall mission objectives can be met or whether a less complex and expensive design could the job as well. It will support multiple missions without additional coding. Customized analysis needs can be met by \"plug-in\" user-developed modules, connection with existing simulations through the standard interface or via data files generated by an external program. Phase I will provide detailed system definition and requirements and will include rapid- prototyping of a module to evaluation two mission utility figures of merit -- response time (applied to the FAS mission) and stationkeeping accuracy (applied to autonomous orbit maintenance). This will allow the government to evaluate specific features and requirements to be incorporated in the Phase II development.",

Phase I will determine the government requirements which can be met by the proposed vehicle and conduct a formal review of a specific point design and the methods employed to hold down cost. Phase I will result in an overall requirements definition, a point design to meet those requirements at dramatically lower than traditional costs, a technology demonstration plan, and the results of a formal review of these elements. Phase II will begin with a technology demonstration (building and firing tanks and engine) to show that the proposed methods can result in dramatic cost savings, even during the development cycle. It will also address specific technical issues such as control system response times, fabrication and assembley techniques, and issues raised during the Phase I review. By the end of the Phase II the government will have a demonstration of the key cost saving technologies, identification and assessment of the principal technical, cost, and management issues involved, and a specific plan for developing a new launcher for approximately the cost of procuring a single vehicle using more traditional approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In cooperation with Northrop Corporation, Microcosm proposes a program to develop a star tracker based on the Mini-OWLS three axis miniaturized telescope. The Mini-OWLS optical head, developed and patented by Northrop, weighs only 18 grams and can track 6th magnitude stars with an accuracy of 10 arc seconds. The final weight and power of the complete system, estimated at 3 W and less than 0.5 kg, will depend essentially on the microminiaturization of the electronics and the processing algorithm complexity which determines the computational requirements. The recurring sensor cost is expected to be less than 10% of the cost of current units. While the importance of this development will be greatest in interplanetary flight and other applications where weight is critical, it can also help initiate a new generation of small, low- cost, high-accuracy, Earth-orbiting spacecraft. In Phase I, Microcosm will undertake definition of requirements for a general purpose scientific/military/ commercial star tracker, do the system engineering to establish the feasibility of meeting these requirements with the Mini-OWLS technology, and define a programmatic structure for Phase II and Phase III to bring this technology into operational use as rapidly as possible.",

The module will operate in a continuous acquisition (wrap-around) mode enabling storage of pre-trigger data. The custom IC will be implemented in Vitesse Semiconductor's 0.6 micron GaAs process for operation at a minimum of 300 MHz, with a goal of 500 MHz. A high bandwidth memory interface will be designed to take advantage of high speed, high density BiCMOS static RAMs for extended waveform storage. The GaAs IC will include a phase-locked Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) to generate the sample clock, and registers, programmable by the microcontroller, to control the amount of pre-trigger delay. Data acquisition can be enabled by the microcontroller or by an external \"enable acquisition\" signal. An internal threshold comparator can be set for automatic level triggering, or an external \"stop acquisition\" signal can be applied to terminate data acquisition.",

(SPEC) has developed a Phase Resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy (PRFS) biosensor which is capable of detecting and classifying biological materials. SPEC's PRFS biosensor uses lifetime fluorescence to provide: (1) enhanced senstivity to structural differences associated with various classes and species of bacteria, and (2) a means to reduce fluorescence interference from other bacterial fluorophores. SPEC has shown that lifetime determination by phase and frequency can achieve picosecond resolution. This resolution is sufficient for discriminating between bacterial species and classes. PRFS is based on the physical phenomena occurring when a fluorescent bacteria is excited with sinusoidally modulated light, inducing a phase shifted emission corresponding to the time lag between absorption and fluorescence. These \"phase\" fluorescence parameters are used to generate Excitation Emission Frequency Arrays (EEFAs) for use in detecting, classifying and monitoring concentration changes of potentially dangerous bacterial/biological materials. In Phase I, SPEC will: (1) develop a PRFS Biosensor System specification; (2) design a signal processing scheme; (3) perform PRFS biosensor laboratory investigations and demonstrations; (4) design a miniaturized PRFS Biosensor, incorporated Multi-Chip Module (MCM) technolgy and leading to a Phase II PRFS Biosensor prototype, which will be delivered to the Army for field evaluation.",

We are currently developing analog CMOS speech recognition chips combining integrated silicon cochleae and neural networks based on auditory system modeling. We have demonstrated a prototype version of our low-precision highly parallel analog neural network in the laboratory. Under NSF funding, we will continue to research and develop these massively parallelo custom integrated circuits that will perform recognition of speaker-independent connected speech, using integrated delay lines and analog computing networks. During this Phase I, we propose to investigate robust speech processing as an intuitive interface to relieve crew work load and enhance crew safety. We will develop the performance specifications required for a speech system to solve a real Air Force human factors problem. We will also capture representative speech data, experiment with recognition of the data, and prepare for the Phase II effort to deploy a full-scale prototype speech recognition system based on our custom integrated circuits. This effort serves to focus our advanced neural network research on an important real-world problem and may lead directly to inexpensive products with wide commercial applicability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Future weapon systems require significant advances in computing systems scale and functionality. Neural networks hold considerable promise to deliver very high performance and powerful new capabilities, as well as compact physical size, low power and high reliability. Such electronic neural networks are very attractive to system developers. To date actual systems incorporating electronic neural networks have been limited (and expensive), due to a lack of flexibility in constructing custom network architectures with the available hardware modules. We propose to develop electronic design synthesis tools for constructing custom integrated circuits that implement application-specific neural networks. These tools will assist the application engineer in selecting between broad classes of analog and digital implementation technologies, architectures, interconnect topologies, interfaces, and permit direct circuit synthesis of manufacturable integrated circuits. The tools would also interface to simulators and development systems, to assist the designer in validating the neural network using experimental and training data. In Phase I, we will prove the tools by FABRICATING demonstration circuits built on existing Tanner Research technology. Our approach will utilize commercial integrated circuit technology; products arising from this R&D; can be fabricated reliably and economically by a number of vendors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The dynamic range of modern image sensors can exceed the range of a video monitor by an order of magnitude or more. This means that fast arid intelligent range compression and image enhancement must be interposed between the sensor and display for effective surveillance, target acquisition, and intelligence gathering. Digital hardware can enhance an image in real time, but the common method for range compression on digital hardware, linear filtering, can severely distort the image. We propose to evaluate designs for high-speed image range compression chips. At Tanner Research, image processors are under development that carry out nonlinear filtering for range compression and image enhancement at video rates. The nonlinear filtering intelligently compresses the range without distortion. We will prepare a design that increases processing speed by an order of magnitude, to 500-1000 frames per second, in the Phase I effort. We will measure the performance limits of the existing processor; results will guide in the design task. In Phase lI, we will fabricate and test the high-speed processor technology.",

INNOVATIVE DYNAMICS (ID) HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN SEVERAL OF THESE PROGRAMS AND AS A RESULT HAS DEVELOPED AN ICE SENSOR BASED ON \"SMART STRUCTURES\" TECHNOLOGY. BY MONITORING THE VIBRATION SIGNATURE OF A STRUCTURE, THE SYSTEM DETERMINES ICE THICKNESS AND DISTRIBUTIONS USING A NETWORK OF EMBEDDED SENSOR ARRAYS AND DISTRIBUTED PROCESSORS. PATTERN RECOGNITION TECHNIQUES ARE UTILIZED TO CLASSIFY THE SENSOR SIGNALS AND DETERMINE ICE BUILDUP AND ASSOCIATED AERODYNAMIC PENALTY. THE MEMORY OF THE SYSTEM IS FORMED THROUGH A LEARNING PROCESS IN WHICH A SYSTEMATIC SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS IS PRESENTED TO THE SYSTEM IN THE ICING WIND TUNNEL ENVIRONMENT. THE ICE DETECTION SYSTEM DESCRIBED HERE COULD BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A VARIETY OF DEICING SYSTEM COMPONENTS TO PROVIDE AUTONOMOUS ICE PROTECTION CAPABILITY. DEICING TECHNOLOGIES TO BE EVALUATED INCLUDE ELECTRO-EXPULSIVE (EEDS), PNEUMATIC IMPULSE (PIIP) AND SHAPE MEMORY ALLOY (SMA) DEICERS. DURING THE PHASE I PROGRAM, ID WILL INTEGRATE THESE DEICING ACTUATORS WITH OUR ICE DETECTION SYSTEM FOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION IN AN ICING CHAMBER. THE BEST OVERALL PERFORMER WILL BE DEVELOPED INTO AN INTEGRAL UAV STRUCTURE FOR ICING QUALIFICATION TESTING DURING THE PHASE II PROGRAM. THE PROPOSED AUTONOMOUS ICE PROTECTION SYSTEM WILL OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE TO CURRENT DEICING SYSTEMS USED ON COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY AIRCRAFT. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS SYSTEM CAN BE APPLIED TO ADVANCED COMMERCIAL TRANSPORTS WITH HIGH BYPASS AND TURBOPROP ENGINES WHERE ENGINE BLEED AIR IS NOT AVAILABLE.",

The JVD process uses supersonic jets in \"low vacuum\" to propel atoms, molecules, or clusters toward substrates. JVD offers: (1) extremely high rates of concentrated, efficient deposition; (2) low vacuum operation which simplifies automation versus high vacuum PVD systems; low temperature, ion-assisted processing permitting deposition on thermally sensitive substrates; (3) capability for high rate \"reactive\" formation of alloys, intermetallics, compounds and multi-layer nanostructures. Pratt & Whitney has selected two promising applications for development: i) Titanium-nitride based erosion-resistant coatings on fan and compressor components; and ii) Multi-layer, nickel-aluminide nanostructured coatings for service as strong, crack-resistant, thermally-durable, oxidation-barriers on turbine airfoils. JPC will prepare experimental JVD coatings on test \"coupons\" provided by P&W.; P&W; will then test these coatings using standard techniques. JPC and P&W; will meet to jointly evaluate coating test results and projected economics of JVD manufacturing processes.
