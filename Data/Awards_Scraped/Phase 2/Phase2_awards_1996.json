        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective is an optical periodontal probe tailored to automatically measure and record multiple tissue parameters deemed important for disease detection and treatment monitoring. As a first step in the development of a multi-functional device, a probe designed to mimic the visual measurements made by dental clinicians to determine pocket depth, bleeding on probing (BOP) and tissue coloration will be constructed. The BOP and tissue coloration measurement will serve as an indicator of present inflammatory activity, while the pocket depth measurement will be useful for longitudinal periodontal disease monitoring. The pocket depth measurement will be completed using a new scanning technique. Both BOP and tissue coloration will be determined using a straightforward optical technique. Phase I will verify that the envisioned optical probe can measure pocket depth and indicate BOP using a simulated in vivo model. Optical methods to determine other tissue parameters, including tissue coloration and sulcular pH, will be evaluated in Phase II. Clinical verification of the multi-purpose optical probe will also be completed in Phase II, when a compact, robust clinically useful prototype will be constructed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Automated processing of sensor/signal data and other non-sensor information provides substantial force-multiplying benefits. The timely and cost-effective leveraging of these types of information provides a significant advantage over adversaries not possessing comparable information processing capabilities. The intelligent processing of diverse types of data provides a target assessment technology that can more robustly deal with a greater number battlefield scenarios and provide a real-time capability. This proposal presents an innovative approach to automatically developing target assessment models. A development tool is proposed, the Automated Target Assessment Development Environment (ATADE). The target assessment models produced by ATADE will intelligently combines multi-sensor data and non-sensor information using several advanced computing technologies [24-28]. ATADE itself will take advantage of a synergistic integration of expert systems and abductive polynomial network technologies. The result will be a well-defined methodology to extract high-level decision knowledge from low-level sensor imagery for complex battlefield decision-aiding tasks. The proposed effort uses a multi-technology approach to provided several levels of target assessment information, including position identification, capability, and significance determination. Initial feasibility of this synergistic methodology has been demonstrated under ongoing federal funding. Anticipated Benefits: ATADE will have direct applicability to other civilian and military all-source information fusion challenges, such as those for commercial and private fixed-wing aircraft, air traffic control, and air combat. ATADE will enalbe a highly automated process for quickly and cost-effectively developing information fusion solutions to a wide variety of tasks. AbTech will commercialize ATADE to the maximum extent possible by offering it commercially in a general software tool.",

The timely and cost-effective leveraging of information provides a signficant advantage over adversaries not possessing comparable information processing capabilties. Among these is automatic target recognition (ATR). Under previous and current Federal funding, AbTech has developed an innovative, robust, and effective approach to automatic target recognition The approach combines the numeric processing capabilities of abductive polynomial networks with the symbolic processing power of expert systems. The result is an ATR system that intelligently processes multi-spectral imagery (i.e., laser radar, FLIR) and non-sensor information (e.g., intelligence, mission objectives) to provide a wide range of target assessment information including detection, classification, and identification. While this sytem has been developed using actual military sensor imagery, it currently operates in an engineering environment. Issues concerning its implementation on actual avionics processors have not been addressed. Therefore, ADEPT, a VHDL-based approach for determining the actual processing requirements for informatin processing algorithms, will be used to determine the implementation feasibility of the ATR system. Also, the applicability of the ASAAT methodology for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has not been considered. A complementary objective of this effort is to identify the dual-use and commercial potential for ASAAT technology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose to develop an automated Pilot Induced Oscillation (PIO) detection and compensation system.  This will use artificial neural networks to increase speed and the envelope of operation.  PIO is caused when a pilot overcompensates during a \"high gain\" task such as landing, takeoff, refueling, dropping stores, or tracking.  It can also be caused by inefficiencies in the inner loop controllers, such as time delays and phase and rate limits.  PIO represents a significant danger to aircraft and has resulted in a number of high profile accidents, such as the crash of the YF-22.  Some of the most experienced pilots have had PIOs.  Because of their proven ability of fast and accurate pattern recognition and new research into the stability of artificial neural network based control systems, neural networks can be used to develop a system superior to current systems such as the Space Shuttle PIO filter and the JAS-39 system.",

A reliable junction of this type for n-type SiC is the key to its development for high temperature, power conditioning electronics. Phase I will demonstrate that osmium is the ideal metal for forming such junctions. Phase II will develop SiC fast recovery diodes and MESFETs that can perform power conditioning and communications circuits applications at thigh temperatures. These devices will form the foundation for developing prototype devices and circuits to address specific applications requirements of DoD systems, and manufacturers of commercial products (e.g. cellular phones) in Phase III. Commercial markets for SiC (especially B-SiC) devices utilizing this type of junction are: high frequency power (B-SiC) solid state power devices, ultra fast recovery diodes for power conditioning, and mixer diodes for cellular phones communication.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The recent DNA-sponsored conference on Verification and Validation of Nonlinear Structural Dynamic Codes, September 1993, highlighted the need for reliable models as well as codes.  At the present time there are no generally available software tools for utilizing experimental data to correct and refine models implemented on general-purpose codes such as DYNA3D.  Nor are there tools available for evaluating the predictive accuracy of these models.  This project will demonstrate the feasibility of using a generic algorithm for discrete optimization to eliminate systematic modeling error and make coarse parameter adjustments to obtain models suitable for continuous parameter estimation.  Improved methods for defining response metrics and corresponding parameter sets based on the use of Principle Components and singular value decomposition will also be demonstrated.  These advances will be used to enhance the effectiveness of Bayesian parameter estimation for fine-tuning the nonlinear models produced by discrete optimization.  The use of a Bayesian estimator with improved response metrics and associated parameter sets will yield statistical estimates of residential model uncertainty for use in evaluating the predictive accuracy of the refined models.  The proposed project will result in the development of new methods for verification and validation of nonlinear structural models.  These methods may be used to reduce time-to-market and testing costs for a variety of Government and commercial applications including survivability and vulnerability analyses of military structures and crash worthiness studies of commercial automobiles.  All nonlinear structural analyses will be able to employ the methods to increase model fidelity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Herein, an innovative aircraft weighing system based on a set of piezopolymar film pad sensors is described.  The wieghing system, which would operate automatically as the aircraft taxi over it, would be unobtrusive, accurate, and reliable.  These sensor pads could be integrated into the flight deck surface below the grated rubber surface finish.  These thin (20-30 mils) piezopolymer sensing pads could be integrated in such a fashion as to not require additional time or mainpulation of the aircraft as they prepare for launch.  Local electronic signal conditioning would enhance the fidelity and accuracy of the measurement.  For ease of integration, the conditioned signals can be transmitted for catapult settings via an RF transmitter if such an integration requirements is specified.  Such a sensing system would be low cost and low maintenance.  ACX proposes to investigate the feasiblity of this aircraft weighing system based on thin film piezopolymer sensors.  Due to the criticality of the measurement and the strict operational and integration requirements, a significant portion of this program will entail an in depth investigation of the operational, integration and performance requirements for such a thin film aircraft weighing system.  ACX will be aided in the operational requirements investigation by McDonnell Douglas Corp.  To establish the feasibility of such a sensing system, ACX proposes to design and test a set of prototypes to address the requirements determined to have the most significant technical risk.  Once these requirements have been shown to be met, the Phase II can build on these results, working towards a complete prototype system to be demonstrated first on land and then on an aircraft carrier.",

Initially the project will be targeted on developing a system that combines data from a CCD camera operating with visible light, a micro focus X-rays imaging system, and a laser based pointrange sensor. Although the initial focus will be detection of defects in solder joints in gull wing SMT components using the the sensors mentioned above, the system and software architecture will be designed to integrate data from a wide range of sensors at different levels of data abstraction.  System development will be founded on Acuity Imagin's range of standard platform based machine vision systems and will make full use of the image acquisition, image processing, image manipulation and feature extraction capabilities already present in these systems.  Phase I tasks include: brief review of related work; analysis of application requirements; definition of system functionality and specifications; finalization of proposed system architecture and development of detailed hardware/software designs; development of limited breadboard prototypes.  Based on the above work, needs for future R&D; will be identified and Phase II efforts will be planned.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Aculight proposes the development of a frequency tunable source suitable for LADAR measurements from compact military platforms. The source will use a fixed frequency diode pumped solid state drive laser and an optical parametric oscillator, tunable from 1.6 to 2.4 microns.  Output energies will be over 100 micro-J through the spectral range at pulse rates of 10kHz.  The major technical challenge, addressed directly in Phase I, is the short pulse, high PRF operation of the complete driver/OPO system.  The proposed Phase I effort tests a novel, moderate power, short pulse drive laser and demonstrates OPO conversion with both conventional and advanced OPO materials.  The needed drive laser specifications (pulse rate 10 kHz, power 10 to 20W, pulse duration of 10ns, and compact design) are difficult to meet simultaneously.  A cavity dumping technique will be implemented on an existing DP laser to show short pulses suitable for OPO applications.  The drive laser used in Phase I has a substantial technical pedigree, and will enable definitive experiments.  Supporting analysis with state of the art laser and OPO design codes is pivotal to the design.  A plan for the development, compacting and delivery of a rugged device using the most appropriate technology choices is developed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         High pulse energy, high repetition rate, tunable, narrowband sources are needed for optical pumping of mid-infrared gas laser converters.  The source needs continuous tunability over the 1-3 micron band to access different overtone bands in various gaseous gain media.  Due to the need for diode pumping of the source, efficiency is critical to minimizing diode costs.  Our approach is efficient generation of the 1-3 micron output with an injection-seeded optical parametric oscillator-optical parametric amplifier (OPO/OPA) system.  The pump beam for the OPO/OPA system is the fundamental or second harmonic of a Hd:YAG laser.  The key innovation is dramatic enhancement of the conversion efficiency in the OPA by resonantly feeding back the unconverted pump beam. Pump feedback is accomplished with a resonant ring cavity built around the OPA.  Theoretical OPO conversion efficiencies (pump to signal + idler) are near 30% without feedback, and between 75-80% with feedback.  System efficiency is examined further through a preliminary design study on the diode-pumped drive laser. Alternative materials such as Yb:YAG are more effective storage media than Nd:YAG>  thus, there is tremendous potential for reducing the diode laser requirement, and thus the cost.  The Phase I objectives are to demonstrate efficient conversion in a pump feedback OPA through experimental and analytical efforts, and define the architecture of the diode-pumped drive laser.  In Phase II, the drive laser, seeded OPO and OPA are further developed and integrated into a single tunable system to be delivered to the Air Force at the end of Phase II.",

Once developed, the instrumentation and methodology could be interfaced with a reaction sample characterization before and after treatment.  The project has been divided into two phases.  Phase I consists primarily of research and design of the required instrumentation, which would subsequently be constructed and developed during Phase II.  In this Phase I proposal, we propose to investigate the applicability of high-performance, high-energy Auger electron spectroscopy for the characterization of contaminated soil samples, and to design a custom instrument capable of producing two-dimensional images of the samples from the viewpoint of each element.  This approach is promising for the examination of contaminated soils because Auger spectroscopy is particularly sensitive to high atomic number elements (such as heavy metals), and the use of high-energy Auger electrons allows selectivity from the lighter elements typically abundant in soils.  Such instrumentation is not readily available, as it involves the application of some of the most recent advances in surface analysis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         New developments in materials and components create a need for more effective controllers for flexible, lightweight, high-performance systems in DoD, industry, civil infrastructure, and space applications.  Included are automated loading and material handling systems, tank flexible gun barrels, vibration and oscillation in automobiles, bridges, and overhead cranes.  The control problems associated with such structures are difficult, as they do not satisfy assumptions required for existing control algorithms to work well.  Moreover, existing commercial and DoD controllers are inflexible, hard to program, and difficult to port between systems platforms and varying control objectives.  The goal of this proposal is to provide a Unified Design and Real-Time Implementation Methodology for advanced controllers for complex vibratory systems.  Modern controls developments will be included in nonlinear, feedback linearization, adaptive, neural network and fuzzy logic control.  There are three specific objectives - to provide: A Unified Design Methodology for Advanced Control Algorithms. Specific Control Laws for a Nominal Nonlinear Vibratory System. Specifications for a PC-based Modular Real-Time Control System.  Adaptive Robotics, Inc., and UTA's Robotics Institute provide strong industry connections for dual-use commercialization of this Army controller R&D.;",

Today's technology is limited by noise, precluding detection of the smallest particles of interest.  Present instruments are not adequate for the next generation of semiconductor devices.\r \r Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that more information can be obtained from light scattered by particles than is presently being utilized.  Through a combination of measurements and modeling, it should be possible to identify an optimum configuration (geometry, wavelength, polarization, etc.) for a scattering instrument.  Work includes experimental verification of theoretical scatter models, noise analysis, development of numerical models, selection of potential instrument configurations, comparison and optimization of configurations and development of specifications for a prototype instrument.\r \r If successful, this approach will lead to a prototype instrument capable of detecting and classifying particles as small as 0.06 um on silicon wafers.  This will support the goals of the National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors through the 0.18 um process generation.",

To overcome these limitations, a novel propulsion concept based on a liquid hydrocarbon-fueled Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE) is proposed.  The innovation draws from recent successes in computational fluid dynamics and from several engineering studies and PDE development efforts performed by the authors.  The proposed novel propulsion system has many highly desirable features including a very low unit cost, mechanical simplicity, and favorable performance.  It would also be designed to be insensitive to accidental detonation initiation.  The propulsion system can operate over a range of flight Mach numbers, has the potential to operate in a pure rocket mode, and is well suited for propelling missiles and a variety of other vehicles.",

This is particularly true of scientific and engineering data sets. Analysis methods require access that cross file/data granule boundaries.  We propose to address this problem by integrating unified data models of scientific data as embodied by the widely used data formats CDF, NetCDF, and HDF through the use of a commercially available data management system, METEOR.  We propose to customize METEOR to handle the access requirements as imposed by the CDF, NetCDF, and HDF scientific data models.  In particular this will involve clustering techniques to optimize access to large multidimensional datasets through temporal, spatial, or special sampling ordering rules. In Phase I we propose to demonstrate a prototype system utilizing one of the above data formats integrated with the METEOR data management system.  This will involve a set of extraction and composition filters to populate the METEOR databases with metadata from the scientific datasets against which standard spatial and temporal, or attribute based queries can be formulated.  The datasets retrieved from the data management system using the composition filters, can be merged into a single dataset for analysis.  Phase II would involve specific ordering rules, and building a robust system for integration into a commercial product.",

While the use of arsine is growing, it poses serious environmental and safety problems in the industry.

It has designed and been granted patents for novel materials that treat metallization, etchant, and hydride gases commnonly used in electronic thin film deposition. This chemical expertise has been combined with the equipment design expertise of Novapure Corporation to provide the industry with an alternative and cost effective approach to semiconductor gas effluent treatment. In Phase I, ATM expects to both complete a survey of all possible methods of arsine detoxification, and to also determine the feasibility of a unique solid-phase scrubbing concept for the chemisorption and eventual detoxification of arsine. In Phase II, ATM, with Novapure Corporation, will supply a minimum of 3 Air Force-designated reactors with complete arsine effluent systems for B-site evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The potential applications of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have only begun to be recognized.  This technology demands thin film materials with exceptional microstructural quality for high performance and processes with high yields.  For piezoelectric microactuator applications, thin film lead zirconate titanate (PZT) is the leading material choice.  Furthermore, substitutional modifications offer the possibility for drastically reduced drive voltages necessary for actuation.  A significant opportunity exists to develop a new process for deposition of a thin film microactuator material based on PZT.  Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is the method of choice because it yields excellent microcrystallinity, has high deposition rates, and scales to large areas.  Preliminary results at ATMI indicate that the deposition of high quality substitutionally modified thin films based on PZT is possible by MOCVD.  In Phase I, we will develop this process for microactuator applications.  Actuation an the piezoelectric coefficients of both unmodified and modified PZT will be measured at Honeywell Technology Center.  Phase II will result in a process optimized for microfabricated cantilever devices, which will be fabricated with Honeywell.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Multilayer thin films deposited onto Si wafers often exhibit high residual stresses during processing, leading to structural failure and/or electrical breakdown.  Traditional scanning x-ray diffraction provides an accurate measurement of complex stress behavior in multilayer structures, but is difficult to carry out on a routine basis.  Laser deflection methods are easy to perform but provide a limited macroscopic indication of only planer stress in a single layer.  ATM, in conjunction with Penn State University and Proto Manufacturing, proposes to develop a routine wafer stress mapping instrument that offers comprehensive analysis of x-ray diffraction combined with the simplicity/mapping capability of laser deflection.  The proposed system utilizes a compact, non-moving fiber-optic detector, a small (only 200 watt) x-ray source, and single exposure measuring technique.  Proposed system is based on a commercially proven XRD stress system for bulk metals stress analysis.  Automated mapping and thermal cycling capabilities will be included in the system.  Successful completion of Phase 1 program will result in a fully operational stress mapping system to be marketed and manufactured for commercial sale during Phase II.",

The unique high temperature properties and chemical robustness of SiC make it an ideal choice for applications where generic components and sensors need to function under widely varying environmental conditions The wide range of environments in which military hardware must function requires sensors which have a high degree of temperture and chemical robustness. We proposed to fabricate SiC accelerometers using surface micromachining techniques which are capable of sustained operation in harsh environments such as active guidance systems for artillery projectiles. SiC has been primarily viewed as a material suited to high temperature electronics and blue light emitting diodes. We believe this to be the first attempt to leverage the intrinsic properties of SiC for stand alone sensing applications. These sensors will also be useful in other applications where corrosion resistance and high temperature performance are critical such as semiconductor processing equipment and automobile engine monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A $1B commercial blue optoelectronics industry supplying full color displays, high speed communications systems, and high density optical recording devices will happen. The question is: which technology, II-VI materials, III-V nitrides, or silicon carbide and its alloys, will dominate? Theoretical calculations and experimental external quantum efficiencies combined favor a direct band gap material; the mechanical properties of the III-Vs are superior to the II-VIs; contact technology is more mature in silicon carbide. We propose a novel high brightness blue LED based on GaN heterostructures grown by chemical vapor deposition on conductive silicon carbide substrates to take advantage of both the nitride and silicon carbide materials systems. The GaN heterostructure will use a resonant optical cavity analogous to those used in ALGaAs LED technology for increased efficiency. Phase I will be devoted to the fabrication of distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) using a multilayer stack of GaN/A1N. In Phase II, a complete GaN LED structure will be fabricated and the performance enhancement provided by the resonant cavity structure will be determined. In Phase III, bright blue LEDs will be manufactured and the GaN-based technology will be extended to other optoelectronics including lasers for communications and optical storage. Anticipated Benefits: The availability of high brightness blue LEDs based on the resonant cavity structure could make full color solid state display viable. The additional bonus of a narrow emission linewidth provided by the resonant cavity could allow solid state blue light emitters to be used in WDM fiber optic networks or for high density magneto-otpic data storage devices",

A major opportunity exists to increase the performance of IR focal plan arrays (IRFPAs) using high dielectric constant BaSrTiO3 (BST) films to increase charge storage at the forcal plan. ATM recently announced an ARPA research program to develop BST capacitors for 1-gigabit dynamic random access memories (DRAMs), and the team members include IBM, TI and Micrn Semiconductor. Although early in the effort, capcitors with 30 fF/mm2 with low leakage have been demonstrated on 150 mm wafers. Dielectric constant for the BST is greater thatn 550 for 1400A films. The objective of Phse I is to deposit Ba1-xSrxTi)3 thin films by chemical vapor deposition on 150mm Si wafers. The effort will build upon DRAM technology, while focusing on unique requirements of cryogenic analog storage capcitors.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Traditionally, kinematic measurements have been made using electro-mechanical transducers which produce a signal which is proportional to the parameter being measured. This approach is unlikely to be replaced by optical tracking techniques, but there are many instances where it is impractical (or even impossible) to attach a mechanical device to the subject. The blades of a helicopter rotot are an excellent case-in-point. While a better understanding of blade kinematics is fundamental to the design of the aircraft, it is difficult to recover three-dimensional kinematics by traditional means under operational conditions. 4D Video believes that an image-based motion measurement system can be used to quantify the rigid-body dynamics of helicopter rotor blades under operational conditions. We propose to investigate the most appropriate means for achieving this objective. Our purpose is to develop a specification which will form the foundation of an SBIR Phase II proposal to develop new hardware and software to perform the required tasks. For the purpose of the present proposal, our effort will focus on two issues: sample-rate, and the development of a customized (circular) tracking algorithm which will take maximum advantage of the predominant motions of the rotor blades. However, other issues have been identified and will be addressed.",

Additionally, performance measurement in large classes becomes difficult unless trainees have identical training scenarios and evaluations.

Phase I will consist of a study of training methods used at Goodfellow AFB's Fire School followed with an intense design and analysis of a VR fire fighter trainer to be used in live fireground training augmentation.  The six-month project will conclude with a final report recommending training fire scenarios, interactive trainer interfaces and measurement tools, hardware platforms and a preliminary design for VR fire fighter trainer to be developed in Phase II.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Holloman AFB rocket sled requirements for computing the aeroheating and structural temperature effects thereof exceed the capabilities of available aeroheating methods in that accounting for shock impingement heating, real-gas, or non-air effects as needed for the sled application may be absent from these methods.  In this SBIR Phase I effort an approach is proposed which will modify a flow code similar to the LANMIN code to include these effects.  A companion conduction code, similar to the EXITS code, will be tailored to the thermal structural geometries of the Holloman rocket sled.  The operation of this code will be compatible with the output of the flow code.  The shock impingement effects will incorporate the results from NASA TN D-7139 and other available analytical/experimental work on this effect.  The equilibrium real air Mollier tables will be made sufficiently large to include the extreme temperature associated with mach 10 operation in the Holloman atmospheric conditions.  The Mollier tables for helium will be installed for computing the heating on the sled when passing through that gas.  The resultant codes will allow the Holloman Test Group to compute the thermal protection (TPS) requirements at critical locations on the sled and the bond-line temperature between the TPS and that tests of candidate TPS materials can be performed to develop the TPS needed for the rocket sled - the ultimate objective of the program.  The Phase II commercialization potential includes other hypersonic vehicle applications (like the NASP concept) within the aerospace industry; and industrial situations requiring TPS material for high temperature, high heat-rate environments, such as material casting and extrusion facilities (steel and aluminum).",

The overall objective of Phase I is to develop a design for a working prototype of an innovative, low cost, reliable, low mass, long life 500 watt solar power system for small spacecraft. Phase I will also determine the magnitude of the improved performance AMTEC offers small spacecraft space power systems. The proposed work will define in detail a 500 We, solar AMTEC system capable of reducing the size and cost of space power systems with acceptable risk and provide the systems work required for space and terrestrial applications. Project tasks include: (1) spacecraft requirements, (2) performance evaluation, (3) system selection, (4) conceptual design of the 500 We solar power systems based upon the requirements. The prototype system will be fabricated and tested in the Phase II effort if the results of Phase I are promising.",

Suitability of current, near term, and future technology will be evaluated to determine refinements to designs, systems, and components needed to reach both commercial and military objectives. A design concept will address objectives including lower cost to fabricate, minimized service requirements, high reliability, and ease of use, which are critical to commercial market and military acceptance and actual usage of the technology. This new laser, once developed, will have a tightly focused high power beam for industrial applications enabling it to weld and cut faster and deeper, with more precision and drill finer, more precise holes than other comparable lasers. It will have excellant coherence and power, making it useful for scientific and military targeting and imaging applications.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Spatial light modulators are the limited component of optical signal processors. Electronic modulators, including liquid crystals and magento-optic modulators, are expensive, low resolution, and slow. The optical disk offers high resolution at moderate cost. The \"pixel\" size is on the order of one micron. The total system works to this accuracy by using an active feedback controlled system for alignment and focus. The optical disk spins, moving new areas under the read/write mechanism. In an optical processor, the movement of the disk and head would bring new images or filters into alignment quickly. AOS proposes to focus a Phase I program on the use of the disk as a modulator for a spatial filter. Several programs, including those at our company and many at the Army Missile Command, have realized that feeding large numbers of matched filters through an optical processor is the bottleneck. A unique aspect of our proposal is an intention to study both the magneto-optic disk, and the PhotoCD(tm). There are advantages and disadvantages to each. Anticipated Benefits: The government has numerous programs in optical processing which will benefit by this technology, including ARPA's TOPS. The R&D; market is ready for such a device. We will have industrial support during Phase II to develop a commercial modulator. Our sights are even higher - such a modulator could make other commercial applications of optical processing practical.",

The Fourier transform of an image represents the information in terms of angles and spatial frequencies.  In this case we are interested only in the angles. The transform of a missile-like target is dominated by one dashed line.  The location of this line does not vary with the location of the target in the field of view.  The location does not vary with the scale (and thus range) of the target.  Even if the target is briefly obscured, there is no need to \"search\" for the image or the data - in the Fourier  transform plane is it just there.  This transform approach makes the analysis of data gathering easy, rapid, and very accurate, at the expense of having to perform the 2-D spatial Fourier Transform.",

The application of domain inversion to electro-optical modulators introduces a novel approach that allows the development of devices with low levels of nonlinear distortions and large efficiencies at reasonably high microwave modulation frequencies. For commercial viability, it is quintessential that high device performance be achieved with simplified modulator schemes, leading to higher stability and reproducibility of the devices. The proposed Phase I program will demonstrate the advantages of using domain inversion as compared to other techniques presently being used and will lay the technical foundation for the design and fabrication of linearized, broad-band directional coupler and interferometric modulators.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         It is difficult to remove oil and AFFF from voluminous streams. Research has been continously carried out to develop new technologies to be employed in this field of application with little success. Air-sparged hydrocyclone (ASH) flotation technology is a new technology developed by the University of Utah and Advanced Processing Technologies, Inc. It combines the advantages from both conventional hydroclones and froth floatation into a single piece of equipment and may provide a unique opportunity for the fast separation of dispersed oil from significantly large waste water streams with a proven processing capacity of about 100-600 times more than that offered by other flotation machines. A research program is proposed to DOD to investigate the feasibility for the application of the air-sparged hydrocyclone floatation technology for the removal and separation of oil and AFFF waste water. If this Phase I preliminary small-scale program is proven successful, a rather more detailed and large-scale program for both fundamental study and field testing will be proposed in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         With the growing acceptance of the new ADS-33C handling qualities specification, it is essential that flight test engineers and pilots be effectively trained in this new methodology as soon as possible. personal Computer (PC) based tutorials provide convenient and cost effective training aids, allowing students to learn at their own pace and schedule. Due to practical considerations of memory and mass storage, most PC-based tutorials must use canned scenarios that limit the scope of a student's interaction. Recent advances in network technology have allowed PC's to act as smart terminals and remotely share access tomemory, mass storage and CPU capacity of more powerful UNIX based computers and workstations. ART has developed FLIGHTLAB, a software tool for interactive design, simulation and analysis of rotorcraft that utilizes the computational power and X-window interface of UNIX base workstations. ART proposes to develop a PC-based tutorial on handling qualities and control system specification that provides extensive interactive access to FLIGHTLAB through a network connection to a UNIX workstation running FLIGHTLAB. This tutorial would utilize FLIGHTALAB's flight test planning and analysis interface and simulation capability to allow students to alter design configurations, conduct simulated flight tests on the design vehicle, and analyze the results. Those with direct access to the FLIGHTLAB workstation could then correlate the analysis with a piloted evaluation using FLIGHTLAB'S real time capability. The hands-on simulation experience will be augmented with access to flight test data down loaded to the FLIGHTLAB data base for access by the handling qualities utilities.",

New mission requirements (drug interdiction) and new sensor/system developments exceed the scope of the original design and mission of the C-CS.  As a result, there exists a need to upgrade the C-CS and ensure ongoing NORAD effectiveness.  By conducting extensive research with the ROCC group at Hanscom AFB, AVD will explore methods to optimize C-CS performance, project capacity requirements, and analyze communications scenarios for both wartime and peacetime missions.  AVD has extensive knowledge and capabilities for modeling advanced computer-communications systems, combining established simulation practices with a unique animation technique.  The results of an AVD model will enable ROCC/SOCC command and control to produce valid operational statistics and then visually observe system performance using a full-motion, animated graphical representation on an ordinary PC.  Upon completing initial research, AVD will demonstrate the feasibility of its simulation/animation technique by producing a working prototype of a selected high-payoff area.  The principal investigator and senior engineer involved have extensive experience in simulation and modeling specifically related to computer and communications systems, and have published numerous works on the subject.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose a new approach to automatic target recognition based on the concept of stochastically deformable templates. In contrast to conventional static approaches, our concept is based on active image tracking. It allows for simultaneous image processing, parameter estimation, and filtering. High target signature variability captured by optical, infrared, millimeter-wave and microwave radar acoustic sensors, etc. substantially diminishes the effective- ness of these technologies in automatic target recognition systems. In this proposal, we address related problems of effective representation and processing of target signatures subject to random fluctuations. Our approach is to represent randomly perturbed dynamically evolving images using the emerging mathe- matical technique of wavelet descriptors for stochastically deformable templates. The wavelet descriptor has many desirable properties including multiresolution representation, invariance, uniqueness, stability and spatial localization. Real time processing of randomly evolving target signatures is seriously restricted by limitations on availability of communication channels, bandwidth length, computer power, etc. One way to circumvent these difficulties is the dynamic distribution of resolution, so that the maximum resolution windows are applied to a small number of the image landmarks. To achieve this goal, we propose a new method of template deformation tracking and prediction, based on the nonlinear filtering approach. Specifically, we use a new fast spectral algorithm for nonlinear filtering. By separation of observations and parameters, this algorithm shifts the main bulk of computations off line. The main objective of the project is to demonstrate that the recent breakthroughs in wavelet-based image descriptors and fast nonlinear filtering make feasible the real-time implementation of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         High intensity cooling of expansion turbine blades is proposed, using a self-stabilized evaporation/condensation process within each blade.  The result is low blade structural temperature, with waste heat delivered to a low pressure air flow.  This is a key technology requirement for development of a fully cooled gas turbine, with potential for operation at radically increased turbine inlet temperature, while avoiding high cost superalloys. The approach provides uniform and stable cooling of the entire blade, with the evaporated coolant flowing as vapor to the blade root, where it condenses while transferring heat to low pressure air flow.  The key to achieving uniform evaporative cooling is establishment of a liquid flow, driven by the centrifugal acceleration field of the turbine, filling numerous transverse capture shelves on the inside blade wall surfaces.  It cascades from the inner shelf outward, with vapor from each returning to the root region for condensation and recycle.  The high acceleration field forces highly efficient nucleate pool boiling at each shelf, resulting in metal temperature close to the liquid boiling point. Thus a fully enclosed Return Flow Cascade of alkali metal coolant is established.  The Phase I program will experimentally validate this approach under high acceleration conditions.",

Toward this end, detailed experimental characterization of spray flames is essential.  This includes measurement of various fuel droplet parameters such as droplet size, velocity, number density, temperature, composition, and droplet vaporization rates in spray flames.  The availability of the phase Doppler instrument has permitted simultaneous measurement of droplet size, velocity, and number density of fuel droplets in spray flames.  However, the measurement of individual fuel droplet temperatures not been possible thus far.  This proposal deals with diagnostic development for droplet temperature measurement in addition to droplet size and velocity in spray flames.  The diagnostic instruments consists of rainbow refractometer which is fully integrated to a phase Doppler particle analyzer.  The droplet size and velocity is measured with the phase Doppler particle analyzer and the droplet refractive index is measured with the rainbow refractometer.  Sbusequently, the fuel droplet temperature is inferred from the droplet refractive index using a known relationship between the variation of the fuel refractive index with temperature.  Various innovative techniques have been proposed to minimize errors resulting from droplet inhomogeneity and for increasing the measurement accuracy.",

The matrix polymers that make graphite-composites manufactured using this process possible are based on electron-beam curing of low viscosity Epoxy Functionalized Siloxane (EFS) polymers that have been shown to resist atomic oxygen, while exhibiting excellent mechanical and physical properties.  This resin can be specially formulated with other low cost resins, toughener thermoplastic powers, and a proprietary low-dose-to-cure catalyst to lower the resins cost as well as improve on the already tougher-than-epoxy, hydrophobic, high Tg (>250 C) properties of the base resign.  These composites are designed to be environmentally and hygienically friendly and outperform composites produced by competing fabrication techniques.",

Improvedments to existing algorithms should enable the routine simulation of such problems as aircraft store separation phenomena. A discretization of the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations will be modified to include the effects of moving grids and arbitrarily high temporal accuracy. Restrictions in maximum allowable time step will be eliminated through the use of an implicit dual-time-step formulation. Preconditioning the compressible Navier-Stokes equations will eliminate stiffness of convergence due to Mach number, Reynolds number and cell aspect ration such that the formulation will be appropriate for very low Mach number and transonic flows. Unstructured discretization of the domain is accomplished with algorithms based upon three-dimensional advancing front technology as well as Delaunay triangulation. Solution accuracy will be improved through the use of global and local element refinement.",

Wired links between sensors and their controls require skilled preplanning and installation. They are expensive to maintain, especially in the connections to central security monitors and command centers. We propose to use a radio based communication system to replace the hardwire/fiberoptic links. This sysem is packet radio based and uses an adaptive method of network and communication optimization. The key feature is that each reporting node in the system is a transceiver that acts as independent data transfer switch. Each transceiver will automatically adapt to network fault problems, data errors, and change data routing patterns without human intervention. Radio packet transmnissions will permit encryption and the use of anti-jamming techniques. AES will develop the software protocols and hardware needed to build a demonstration system which will automatically reconfigure and optimize the security network to pass data between each node and a central control. AES has extensive overseas and domestic experience in designing and installing radio based security systems. The military and commerical viability of this concept are manifest in ease of deploynment, simplified skill level required for installation, multiple anti-jamming techniques, and elimination of repeaters.",

Traditional DNA/RNA analysis methods are not applicable for field-use or a routine environment because they require complex procedures, large instruments, and lengthy procedures.  To overcome the limitations of current technology AndCare, Inc. proposes to develop an approach whose central feature is the use of a hand-held, battery operated, monitor that uses mass  produced, pre-calibrated, disposable sensor electrodes able to detect specific DNA or RNA sequences.  In Phase I we will downsize and otherwise modify AndCare's existing instrument from a desk-top to a hand-held, self-contained, battery operated model.  The low-cost, disposable sensor will be formed by the controlled deposition of nanometer sized colloidal gold particles containing immobilized biomolecules onto the surface of screen-printed carbon electrodes.  These sensors will directly address the problem areas identified and will integrate with the hand-held electronic monitor to yield inexpensive devices that are user-friendly and sufficiently accurate to yield reliable results. The monitors and sensors will be easily manufactured with low defect rates.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In mammography, early detection of breast cancer is dependent upon the ability of the imagingsystem to resolve characteristic distributions and shapes of small microcalcifications in the breast tissue,since approximately 80% of excised breast cancers show areas of calcification on histologicexamination. The medical community has not been satisfied with the imaging performance of standardfilm-screen in its ability to produce the required quality images. Recently, there has been a desire toresolve 50 micromoles structures with very high detection efficiency. This technique would allow a veryhigh spatial resolution, superior to slow film-screen, with an efficiency greater than fast film-screen. Amicrostructured scintillator film would allow images to be obtained with a lower dose than film-screen,while the digital nature of the image would permit a wide dynamic range as well as the possibility ofimage enhancement. The use of a modified low noise amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) detector technologywhich takes advantage of the high scintillator light output will permit high quality digital imaging systemsof 3Ocm x 3Ocm, comparable in area to film-based systems, and much larger than conventionaltechnology currently employed in commercial digital imaging systems. The research would enable thedevelopment of an initial prototype of such a high performance mammographic imaging system.Specifically, we will develop large-area high resolution structured scintillator screens and low-noisea-Si:H detectors needed to carry out this objective.",

PET is able to provide information on both structure and function ofdifferent parts of the brain. It is becoming an important fundamental tool for both clinical diagnosis andmedical research. Presently, PET performance is limited by the photosensors used. Future advancesin PET system technology can only come about by performing research to improve the capabilities ofthe gamma ray detectors. Early results with indium iodide (bandgap 2.01eV) as a photon sensor are veryencouraging and further research into this promising material has a high probability of producing a newdetector technology with better performance which could be the basis for a future generation of PETinstruments. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of using this semiconductor to make this approachwork.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Current research in structural biology is focused on understanding the role of enzymes andproteins in regulating cellular metabolism and the way drugs bind to proteins so that more effective drugswhich can inhibit viral activity may be developed. Macromolecular crystallography provide informationregarding 3D distributions of atoms in biological molecules, and is an important factor in understandingthe mechanisms of such diseases as cancer and AIDS. New X-ray sources like the synchrotron beamsources as well as the new beam lines now under development such as the Advanced Photon Sourcehold great promise for macromolecular crystallography. They have not yet realized their potential dueto the lack of an appropriate position sensitive sensor. To address these specific needs, we propose todevelop a novel, large area X-ray imaging sensor coupled to a CCD using a fiberoptic taper demagnifier.This microstructured plate will produce a combination of greater light output and resolution than standardphosphors, allowing the imaging devices to use greater demagnification tapers and hence a large fieldof view. For detecting X-ray energies typically used in biological macromolecular crystallography, thissensor will provide high resolution, high detection efficiency, and a fast time response, allowing the fullpotential of the modern synchrotron sources to be realized.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Today's tactical aircraft employ sophisticated onboard sensors which can be managed in several dimensions, including spatial focus, sensing modality, and temporal scheduling.  Effective mission operations, such as air interdiction and counter air, require efficient sensor control and scheduling that accounts for the limited availability of sensor resources to support all current sensor tasks, as well as the need to plan for a variety of future contingencies.  This effort develops a theoretical foundation for sensor management based on stochastic dynamic programming, leading to nonmyopic algorithms that utilize statistical track and identification information from an aircraft's sensor fusion system to predict the effects of future sensor management decisions.  Novel open-loop feedback and closed-loop feedback solution methodologies are proposed which are adaptive and even-driven, continually replanning on the basis of the most recent information.  Closed-loop feedback approaches improve upon open-loop feedback by using explicit stochastic models to hedge against uncertain future events.  We further propose to investigate an innovative approach, neuro-dynamic programming, for computing closed-loop feedback solutions.  We will evaluate the algorithms, and select one for demonstration in a prototype sensor management algorithm operating on a simple air interdiction scenario.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Low power has been recently elevated to one of the most critical issues in circuit design, affecting circuit reliability, battery life, and heat sinking.  In spite of this demand, surprisingly little support from CAD vendors exists for automated low power circuit design.  Alternative System Concepts (ASC) and Princeton University propose to design and develop a much needed power optimizing design automation tool incorporating recent research advances in the area of high-level synthesis for low power.  The proposed development tightly couples advanced research at Princeton and innovative VHDL-based CAD tools developed by ASC.  The new tool will implement VHDL behavioral synthesis for low power, transforming a behavioral VHDL description into a structural VHDL description, optimized for power dissipation.  Power minimization will be achieved by simultaneously applying:  1) voltage scaling for fixed throughput; 2) minimization of switching activity in the circuit; 3) reduction of capacitive loads through minimization of module count and interconnect.  Combining low power, area, and performance as co-objectives in the synthesis process will ensure globally optimal designs.  Existing and newly developed methods for transformation, scheduling, and allocation will be integrated into ASC's FRITS object-oriented VHDL framework.",

To meet ambient airquality standards, particularly those for ozone, low-cost ultra-low NOx burnersare needed for these applica-tions.  This will reduce the costs and increase thecompetitiveness of industry that might otherwise be forced to use the expensiveSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) NOx control techniques.Altex has identified and ultralow NOx burner for fluids heating, called the ULNB,that has the potential to reduce NOx to 5 ppm.  The burner does not require fluegas recirculation, steam injection or exotic materials and is projected to havea pollution control cost of approximately $320/ton of NOx removed.  To show thefeasibility and benefits of this burner under the Phase I program a burner willbe fabricated and tested under conditions characteristic of a watertube boiler.Results of analyses and testing will be used to evaluate the burner performanceand costs relative to conventional and low NOx burners and SCR.",

Such cross-linked enzyme crystals (CLECs) remainactive in environments that are otherwise incompatible with enzyme function, including prolongedexposure to high temperatures, extremes of pH, near-anhydrous organic solvents and aqueous-organicsolvent mixtures. CLECs are also remarkably stable against autolysis and exogenous proteasedegradation. This unique set of properties makes CLECs extremely useful in organic synthesis in generaland in the synthesis of optically pure compounds in particular. The authors have demonstrated thesynthetic utility of CLECs in the synthesis of aspartase, catalyzed by thermolysis and in the synthesisof optically pure compounds, catalyzed by lipase from Candida rugosa. In this Phase I study, CLECs ofa cofactor-dependent enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from two different sources will beinvestigated to demonstrate the feasibility of using CLECs of cofactor-dependent enzymes for practicalstereoselective synthesis. ADH was chosen because it is one of the most studied, as well as useful andversatile cofactor-dependent enzymes for stereoselective organic synthesis.",

This eliminates the need for performance limiting analog electronics and off focal plane A/D converters, providing a lower cost, smaller and lighter systems with greater sensitivity. The Amain approach places an extremely low power analog portion of a multiplexed oversample A/D converter (MOSAD) at each pixel site, eliminating all analog multiplexing and readout.  A 1024 by 1024 staring array would have the equivalent of 1,048,576 A/D converters on the focal plane and would operate at power levels equivalent to or less than analog approaches.  There are many electronic technologies, switched CMOS, CCD, CID and active pixel (APS), that can be used to implement the digital conversion process.  These can be built in a monolithic component form without need for special processing or precision components.  This technology can be beneficially applied to all imaging systems; commercial, consumer and military.  The objective of this development program is to design and analyze a fully functional Readout array.  The design target is a 64x64 array with 50 micron cell sizes.  To allow for future shrinkage, a circuit area of less than 25 microns on an edge will be designed.

This device, a multiple quantum well based p-i-n diode pair, is a photonic switch which can be utilized as an electrically modulated reflector or inversely as an optically modulated electronic element.  It can therefore act both as a transmitter or receiver. The extremely low energy required to switch the logic state of a SEED makes it extremely fast, and ideally suited for use on a cryogenically cooled infrared focal plane.  Under this proposed Phase I project Amain will develop a preliminary design for a data link providing a low data rate input to the focal plane for clocks and control logic, and a high data rate output link handling up to a Gbps to receive digital video data.  The interface formats will be designed to be compatible with Amain's proprietary on-focal-plane high-speed A-D converter.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Nonisotopic calorimetric and chemiluminescent technologies will be developed for use withribonuclease protection assays. The ribonuclease protection assay is an increasingly utilized techniquein molecular biology affording sensitive and quantitative measurement of mRNA levels. The ability ofthe assay to detect multiple mRNA levels simultaneously makes this technique a unique and powerfultool for use in research and diagnostic applications. In a ribonuclease protection assay, autoradiographyof the polyacrylamide gel-resolved products represents the endpoint of the experiment. However, allof the available nonisotopic detection protocols require blotting of nucleic acids onto a sold support priorto detection. Therefor, we propose an approach which will circumvent this requirement and allowdetection directly in the gel used to resolve the nucleic acids. Our initial studies demonstrated that invitro transcripts containing 4-thiouridine are both functional in ribonuclease protection assays and canbe detected in gel down to 1 picomole by a colormetric detection protocol using N-ethylamaleimide andbase. During phase I, we will synthesize a derivative of N-ethylmaleimide which has been reported togreatly potentiate the sensitivity of thiol detection. Furthermore, in an effort to extend the sensitivityof ribonuclease protection assays beyond that attainable with radioactivity, we will synthesize a thiolatedderivative of the chemiluminescent molecule isoluminol. This derivative will be coupled to either4-thiouridine- or 5 mercuriuridine-substituted transcripts and detected using a non-enzymatic, butcatalytic, oxidation system with molecules which can all readily diffuse in and out of a polyacrylamidegel matrix. Once we have developed a nonisotopic ribonuclease protection assay, it will be utilized witha panel of oncogene and tumor suppressor gene probes which are used extensively at Ambion for thedevelopment of single base mismatch technologies. Ultimately, the technologies which we develop willhave wide applications in molecular biology research extending beyond ribonuclease protection assays.",

The BFMEC is aimed at small units (such as an artillery battery) and will incorporate recent technological breakthroughs in decision aids.  The BFMEC system is centered on the advanced blackboard model employing dynamic multiple knowledge sources capable of eliminating the traditional knowledge acquisition bottleneck arising from conventional expert systems processing and providing an on-line learning and new knowledge acquisition under stressing operating scenarios.  A conceptual design of specific expert system modules, including hardware implementation and software prototyping environment will be developed.  The proposed concept is expected to provide the following enhanced performance features: (1) automated decision aiding techniques with feedback from previous decisions; (2) eliminate the bottleneck of knowledge acquisition and computational flow; (3) effectively handle the asynchronous distributed detection and hybrid events problem via multi-reasoning strategies; (4) innovatively acquire new knowledge, update incorrect rules, and \"enrich\" the existing knowledge base; and (5) provide high quality decision solutions to the commander with sophisticated situation assessment for perfect target identification and weapon to target assignment.  Our efforts are complemented by the design of full target acquisition and classification algorithm suites that allow realistic evaluation of the developed situation awareness and decision aids expert systems within the context of the actual performance potential of information providing sensors and sources.",

Interactive multimedia is the integration of audiovisualtechnology (as well as text and graphics) with computer-simulated human interaction to control activitiesand to monitor user responses to computer-generated questions. Interactive multimedia is theeducational medium of choice for learning strategies based on games and simulations, which haveproven especially successful in effecting behavioral change among young children. Phase I specific aimsinclude development of an asthma self-management program modeled after existing programs,integration of the program with interactive multimedia presentation technology, and formative evaluationof the system with regard to ease of use and short-term effects, such as knowledge and attitudinalchanges. Long-term effects, such as number of emergency treatments or school absences, will beascertained in Phase II. The significance of this effort is the innovative combination of animation andcomputer-assisted instruction for childhood asthma self-management instruction.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Recent development of planar magnetics has the potential to provide reduced volume, high efficiency and high power density power electronics, devices and components for future advanced 1 kW - 150 kW aeronautical power electronic system applications.  At present, the best available modern commercial power converter volume exceeds that occupied by all of the electronic components in aeronautical power systems.  In order to address the critical need of planar, highly efficient passive and active integrated magnetic components, the target of opportunity in this Small Business Innovative Research Phase I proposal lies in the development of monolithic magnetic modules compatible with future advanced electrical power system applications.  The technology will reduce the overall manufacturing cost, size and weight of electronic or power electronic system by integrating all the passive and active magnetic components on a single monolithic module using a plasma spraying technique.  In Phase I, feasibility of monolithic magnetic technology will be demonstrated by the fabrication of a 51mm x 51mm x 2.5mm monolithic magnetic module carrying the magnetic components of a 100W, 1 MHz power converter.  The Phase I technical objectives include fabrication and analysis of substituted nickel zinc cobalt and manganese zinc cobalt ferrite powders, evaluation of laser patterning CAD/CAM techniques for fabrication of dies for monolithic module, identification of plasma spray deposition parameters for fabrication of near net shape substituted NiZnCo and MnZnCo ferrites thick films in monolithic magnetic module dies, and characterization and testing of monolithic magnetic modules leading to the design concept of a power converter salable to multi-kiloWatt power converter modules in the Phase II of the program.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         An operational requirement is projected for an inexpensive, mobile, submarine acoustic countermeasure capability.  A significant tactical advantage is gained by putting as much distance as possible between the submarine (launch platform) and the mobile countermeasure.  An additional advantage is gained if the submarine has the ability to place the ADC between itself and the torpedo threat.  Adding a propulsion capability with a guidance and control system to a conventional ADC ME2 MOD 1 device would achieve this capability.  This proposal puts forth a conceptual design for the integration of a propulsion, guidance and control capability into a conventional ADC MK2 MOD 1 device.  An inexpensive and producible design for a prototype mobile ADC MK2 MOD 1 countermeasure is proposed which will meet the propulsion requiremetn of 20 knots for 3 minutes. The propulsion system integration into the ADC fixed size package is make possible through innovative use of power gneration, materials, depth control and integrated circiutry component technologies.  All of these technologies are within the stat of the art.  The proposed conceptual design minimizes the design risk and meets operational and cost expectations by maximizing the use of existing ADC MK2 MOD 1 production hardware.",

A major portion of the weight is in the fuel cell stack, a stack of carbon electrodes with metal bipolar plate separators that are sandwiched between two end plates and held in place by tie rods.  We continue to investigate lighter weight materials to use in our conventional fuel cell stack.  However, in this effort we propose to investigate an innovative design, the strip cell stack, that completely eliminates the bipolar plates, end plates and tie rods.  The strip stack is 4.6 times lighter than a bipolar fuel cell stack.  In a conventional Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack, electrons and protons are conducted perpendicular to the electrode plane.  In the strip cell design, ionic conduction is perpendicular to the plane of the electrodes while electron flow is in the plane of the electrodes.  Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of the design with a 4 cell \"substack.\"  In Phase II we will build a coiled 300 watt cell \"stack.\"  The coiled strip cell stack is formed from a sheet of planar strip cells rolled together and placed inside a thin lightweight plastic tube.  The 300 watt strip cell stack should fit in a tube which is about 8.9 cm. in diameter and 20.3 cm. long. The total weight should be slightly over 1 Kg.",

Current uses of headgear which provide air gap sound transmission directly to the ear are uncomfortable, require additional preparation time for the diver and are movement restrictive.  This project will assess the performance of a unique design scuba mouthpiece construction with state-of-the-art magnetostrictive transducer technology and orthodontic geometry which looks and feels similar to current technology mouthpieces.  Assessments of transducer orientation to the bite plate, number of transducers and tooth location/frequency response optimization will be done.  Concurrently, a bite plate will be developed, which when interfaced with the transducer will provide an optimized hearing performance.  As an assembly, the mouthpiece will be adaptable to a conventional second stage breathing air regulator.  The degree of ease of use, comfort, sound volume, sound clarity and safety will determined.",

The Euler solver, MGAERO, uses Cartesioan, not body-fitted grids, and components are independently defined for geometric versatility. It has demonstrated the ability to predict leading-edge vortices and shock capturing; consequently, challenging design problems, such as complete wing/body/nacelle shape tailoring, can be addressed.  To investigate the requirements needed for integration of Euler solver, a study will be made of an aeroeleastic analysis at Mach 1.25 of the Multidisciplinary Wing described in the ASTRES Applications manual.  The study will describe the modifications of the Euler solver and enhancements to ASTROS needed to perform suchan analysis, as well as a comparison to the results obtained from the present flow solver.",

This study will determine the feasibility of new, less expensive alternatives. Nickel-aluminide coatings protect hot turbine engine parts from the effects of oxidation and hot corrosion. The coatings are protective when the aluminum activity near the surface is maintained at a high level. Aluminum near the surface is depleted through scale formation, and replenished through diffusion from the interior. Platinum additions enhance the protectiveness of nickel-aluminide coatings because they increase the aluminum replenishment rate. The new coatings will use two-phase-glass (TPG) overlayers that will reduce aluminum depletion rates, and less-expensive platinum group (Pg) additions that will maintain increased aluminum replenishment rates over nickel-aluminide coatings. Coupons with TPG overlayers and selected Pg aluminides will be prepared and subjected to short-term, realistic oxidation, hot corrosion, and thermal cycling tests on a laboratory scale. The best coatings will be selected for further testing in Phase II. Phase II will include fatigue studies, burner-fatigue testing plan is also proposed as a Phase I Option.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A fundamental problem in automatic target recognition (ATR) is the overwhelming amount of sensor data which must be processed. Target features are localized within the field-of-view (FOV) of the imaging sensor. Uniformly sampling within the FOV is thuus inappropriate, regions with little or no relevance to the task are samples at the same resolution as key features, occupying valuable signal bandwidth and computational resources, and increasing system latencies. Foveal active vision features imaging sensors and processing with graded acuity coupled with context sensitive gaze control, analogous to that prvalent throughout vertebrate vision. Foveal vision operates more efficiently in dynamic scenarios than uniform acuity vision because resolution is treated as a dynmaically allocatable resource, simultaneously achieving wider field-of-view, greater localized resolution, and faster frame rates with significantly reduced processing requirements. The proposed program will develop commercially feasible foveal vision technology and integrate it into a Hierarchical Foveal Machine Vision System for ATR applications. The system uses rectilinear multiresolution sampling and processing which together exploit existing algorithms and hardware, ensure component feasiblity, accelerate prototyping and commercilaization, and reduce manufacturing costs. Hierarchical processing further reduces hardware requirements and accelerates system response.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Wright Laboratory is developing the Avionics Wind Tunnel (AWT) to address current and future avionics system testing needs.  Future testing will be characterized by the requirement to provide sensor inputs from many sources for the highly integrated avionics systems being developed.  To achieve realistic inputs into the processing functions, there must be a common underlying representation of the environment in the testing resources.  Latencies must be minimized and the threat models must have the correct level of fidelity. Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS is a networking technology that can address many unresolved issues in advanced avionics testing.  DIS is a well accepted and highly promoted standard.  DIS developers are focusing on solutions to interoperability issues, particularly terrain.  This is extremely important for air-to-ground applications.  Good latency for intra-laboratory applications with Ethernet has been observed, and use of SCRAMNet could provide even better performance.  The \"plug and play\" capability of DIS has been well demonstrated.  It is a powerful tool for the rapid construction of test scenarios.  DIS models of high fidelity for laboratory applications exist off-the-shelf and many more are under development.  Amherst Systems proposes to evaluate the ability of DIS to support research, development, and testing requirements of integrated avionics systems.",

The ribbon wind approach provides a unique opportunity to manufacture relatively low cost, large format, medium resolution infrared fiberoptic image bundles for industrial, commercial and military applications.  Indeed, this approach has been applied successfully by numerous fiberoptic manufacturing companies to fabricate high performance \"visible-energy\" devices for the U.S. Air Force (heads up displays) and the U.S. Army (ruggedized, remote tank sights).  The NAVY is in the process of developing a passive Missile Warning Receiver (MWR) system for tactical aircraft, utilizing rockwell's mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) 25x256 element detector array (IRFPA).  The imaging bundle/array will sense the plume radiation of an incoming missile and forward this information for calculation of trajectory and speed, providing an effective countermeasure. this Phase I proposal provides a means for AMI to improve the transmission efficiency of its IR glass fiber, the image resolution of its ribbon bundles and to provide proof of concept prototypes to the government for later work involving larger format and longer length bundles.",

The next step to be carried out is a detailed evaluation of demonstrated hardware approaches for specific application in the candidate AEW radar system.  Key component areas to consider are photonic true time delay devices, lightwave transmit-receive beamforming manifolds and monolithic microwave/opto-electric integrated circuit T/R modules for the active aperture. Optical time delay networks are broadband and eliminate the need to compensate for beam squinting in large aperture arrays.  Lightwave beamforming manifolds for phased arrays have been demonstrated for both transmit and receive applications that can be packaged very compactly and are comparatively small in size and weight. In addition, this study would seek to exploit the developments of monolithic microwave and photonic gallium arsenide circuits carried out under the ARPA sponsored MIMIC Program during the past five years that has enabled special and multi-purpose transmit/recieve (T/R) modules to be manufactured by several companies. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The photonic technology insertion to be investigated for the AEW surveillance radar application lends itself also, to space-based and ground airport surveillance radars used for commercial and general aviation traffic control purposes. Further, the commercialization of fiber-optic data and personal communication systems for the information superhighway are anticipated to require compact, lightweight, photonically controlled active arrays capabale of producing multiple, simultaneous, steerable beams on the ground, at sea and in space.",

IT IS ASSERTED THAT TO ACHIEVE HAIR GROWTH STIMULATION, BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS MUST BE DELIVERED INSIDE HAIR FOLLICLE CELLS, AND THAT THE OPTIMAL WAY TO IDENTIFY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS AND METHODS OF THEIR DELIVERY IS TO USE AN IN VITRO SYSTEM. ACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN PRINCIPLE COULD BE ALSO USED TO CAUSE DESIRED IN HAIR COLOR AND APPEARANCE. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A GEL-SUPPORTED THREE-DIMENSIONSL HISTOCULTURE SYSTEM (HOFFMAN, R.M., CANCER CELLS 3, 86-92, 1991) THAT ALLOWS THE INTACT GROWTH AND TESTING OF ALL COMPONENTS OF SKIN, INCLUDING KERATINOCYTES, DERMAL FIBROBLASTS AND HAIR-FOLLICLE CELLS, FOR A PERIOD OF 10 DAYS OR MORE (LI, L., ET AL., PROC., NATL., ACAD., SCI., U.S.A. 88, 1908-1912, 1991). HAIR ITSELF CAN GROW FROM SUCH SKIN CULTURES (LI, L., ET AL., PROC. NATL., ACAD., SCI., U.S.A., 89, 8764-8768, 1992).

USING THE HISTOCULTURE SYSTEM AND FLUOROSCENT-LABELED COMPOUNDS INCLUDED INTO LIPOSOMES, WE WILL STUDY LIPOSOME INTERACTIONS WITH HAIR-FOLLICLE CELLS, TO FIND THE OPTIMAL COMPOSITIONS FOR CELL BINDING, TO INCLUDE INTO THE LIPOSOMES OF A GIVEN COMPOSITION DIFFERENT LOW-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT, WATER-SOLUBLE AND WATER-INSOLUBLE COMPOUNDS AND TO FIND THE OPTIMAL CONDITIONS FOR THE RELEASE OF THE LIPOSOMAL CONTENT INTO HAIR-FOLLICLE CELLS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         In printed circuit board manufacturing, the patterning technology determines not only the ultimate packaging density, but also the economics of the entire process via throughput and yield. Conventional contact and projection printing methods have various shortcomings such as defect generation, mask life degradation, and image field size limitation. Existing direct writing approaches with a focused beam suffer from slow speed and inefficient writing lasers, typical direct-write processing speeds being 0.5 sq. ft./min or less. This proposal presents a program for developing a novel patterning system that not only delivers high resolution over a large image field, but alos produces high exposure throughput and eliminates the shortcomings of conventional systems. It can deliver a throughput . 12 sq. ft./min (i.e., more than an order of magnitude higher than before) with 0.2 mil resolution. These results are achieved by a novel scan-and repeat exposure mechanism which enables seamless exposure of large substrates with a resolution of a few microns. In Phase I we will design a system based on the new concept and demonstrate its feasibility with a breadboard assembly. We will also prepare a cost study to compare the new technology with existing approaches. In Phase II we will design, build and evaluate a fully operational prototype system, which will be developed into a product to be introduced to market in Phase III. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed system will make it possible to print finer patterns on printed circuit boards with higher throughput and lower cost. Finer resolution translates into higher packaging density as well as superior performance, e.g., higher speed. These advances will benefit numerous electronic systems, including high-speed computers, electronics for avionics and space exploration, military electronics, mass storage systems, and instrumentation. Anvik's novel patterning system will also be highly attractive in the production of flat-panel displays, multichip modules, and high-density semiconductor chips.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Apollo Enterprise proposes to develop a highly sensitive, remotely deployable sensor system for hydrocarbon detection in waste water. The novel device is designed to monitor the hydrocarbons in waste water in real time and will serve as a tool to minimize the release of contaminated water into local waste-water systems. Current monitoring is performed by visual inspection based on the presence of an oil sheen. Such inspection can not be satisfied continuously and the location of inspection may not necessarily be the point of release. The proposed remote sensor system has a unique structure that is inexpensive, sensitive, reliable, usable in diverse environments, and universal for the detection of various oils. The data collected by the sensor can be sent to an operation center. Warning signals will also be sent if an oil sheen in waste water is detected. The proposed system can also be modified for quantitative monitoring of oil in water. The proposed remotely deployable sensor will be sensitive and reliable. It can be used for detecting oil in waste water from testing facilities, processing plants, refineries, aviation facilities, fuel storage facilities, and any location where oil contamination in water needs to be monitored. The technology needed to build these devices has already been established under programs at Apollo Enterprise directed toward optical instruments for thin film measurements. Apollo Enterprise proposes to use this technology to develop a highly sensitive remote sensor system that will be an effective tool in environmental monitoring and protection. The development of the sensor system will also be economically advantageous because it can provide early warning of contamination to avoid a costly clean-up process.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Health professionals must often analyze disease cluster allegations made by concerned citizens who sense patterns within small structured environments. Examples include households, families, sibships, wards, cellblocks, classrooms, job types, age classes, and locations within a building. It is crucial for the health professional to know what tests are best in these small-environment problems. A few large-scale methods may be modified to handle small-environment problems. However, exact methods may be better because sample sizes are small. We have extended previous matrix-occupancy methods to yield new, rapid, and exact combinatorial expressions for analysis of patterns of diseased individuals. We will investigate the power of both these and other previously-published methods in structured small environments. To our knowledge, no such systematic investigation has been carried out. We expect that many test methods will be optimal in a restricted range of the parameter space, but not ideal elsewhere. Our long-range goal is to use the results of this power simulation to choose methods for incorporation into a user-friendly PC program that will analyze small structured environment data. We will also help the professional choose the right test method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         There is a global trend towards utilization of satellite communications for information services.  Equivalent system temperature, Ts, is a significant parameter in quantifying the antenna system/link performance, because it represents the noise power spectral density in antenna system figures-of-merit, such as receiver gain/system temperature (G/T), and end-to-end Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).  Unfortunately, Ts is dependent on many parameters.  This presents a significant problem in predicting system performance in the operational environment (indoors - the antenna sees roughly the ambient temperature, outdoors - the antenna sees many other noise sources that may vary significantly over time).  An innovative computer methodology is proposed that uses a novel application of noise theory and an integration of new and existing algorithms to estimate a statistical \"worst case\" in the operating environment based upon a desired availability.  The specific objectives of the Phase I effort are to:  develop a method to measure the composite system noise fugure; develop a statistical method for predicting system ambient operating temperature; develop a method to statistically estimate equivalent antenna temperature; and select supporting computer algorithms.  The technical approach is to resolve each objective by addressing the individual uncertainties and unknowns of the methodology.",

The Phase I project will focus on selection and development of composite materials that can be used for packages as well as generating a design of a package that uses the new materials.  Various combinations of fiber and matrix materials will be analyzed, fabricated and tested to develop a material property data base.  A material will be selected for further evaluation and a prototype brassboard demonstrator will be fabricated.  Development of this new semiconductor package material will provide a replacement for ceramic packages (such as A1203) that are lighter in weight, better match the TCE of the silicon ships, and are better at dissipating waste heat.  The heat dissipation improvement should lead to lower component temperatures and higher reliability of the semiconductor components.",

Currently there exist no general-purpose software packages for composite structural analysis that are accessible to failure investigators who are not experts in these types of analysis.  The proposed research and development effort will fill this void with a flexible user friendly, PC-based analysis tool for assessing the structural integrity of composite components.  V-LAB is a general framework for implementing independent analysis methods which can be coupled for structural analysis of composite components.  The underlying software framework will be based on emerging techniques in object-oriented programming, while the underlying mechanics will be based on state-of-the-art methods ranging from micromechanics-based material models to aerospace industry design and failure analysis codes.  An intuitive, graphically-based interface will be developed to facilitate user interaction with V-LAB, supplemented by an on-line tutorial based on the stress Failure Analysis Logic Network.  Air Force case studies will be used to demonstrate the V-LAB analysis system.",

The results of the Phase I study will be sued to guide and enhance the development of acomprehensive interactive canopy ejection simulation capability for Navy applications.  The study will be conducted to show the feasibility, accuracy, turn-around times required, and shortcomings of the current capabilities.  The study will investigate how state-of-the-art CFD methodologies model the whole range of canopy release scenarios, thruster and ejection boundary condition models, CFD modeling of thin surface and topology changes (i.e., Boolean operations).  The study will also examine the state-of-the-art of post-wake 6 DOF modeling, user interfaces with CFD models, and post-processing capabilities.  As part of this study, we also propose to model a single event of canopy ejection, to be selected in consultation with the Navy.  This simulation will be carried out using FEFL096, and adaptive, ALE, moving body, central and upwind flux limited Euler and navieer-Stokes solver on unstructured adaptive tetrahedral grids.  The tasks envisioned for Phase II include:  enhancement of grid generation capabiities, better preconditioners for iterative flow solvers, increased physical realism for viscous flows via better turbulence models, faster regridding and interpolation strategies, link to a structureal dynamics methodlogy, and visualization tools that are better suited for canopy ejection problems.  These tasks, which we expect to be guided with the Phase I results, are detailed below.  The end product will provide the Navy with an interactive prediction methodology capable of the cost-effective analysis of canopy ejetion phenomena.",

The new scanner will be based on the use of a \"scanning head\" scanning approach which is more simple, accurate, and stable than the approaches previously used.  This results in stable and reproducible signal light measurements with a high transfer efficiency from the laser to the plate and a high light collection efficiency.  A key innovation of the proposed Phase I research will be the development of a low mass source/detector storage phosphor plate scanning unit.  If the research is successful, it can be used as the basis for a commercial scanner for scientific applications.  The accuracy provided would give it a substantial competitive advantage in this market over commercially available scanners.  Its unique random access scan capability will also provide competitive advantages in this market.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Emerging high-speed networking technologies have the potential to dramtically increase access to information in many fields such as education, defense, government information dissemination and health care. However, there are several technical issues that need to be addressed to harness this potential of high-speed networking technology. One ofthese is the development of a new generation of communication protocol architectures to meet the new requirements of gagbit/second wide area networks. Architecture Technology Corporation proposes the design of a new protocol architecture for high-speed netowrks that would enable efficient and easy access to digital libraries of electronic information that would be part of the National Information Infrastructure (NII). Our approach applies two innovative techniques to the deisgn of information retrieval protocols: 1) application-level data segmentation; and 2) application specific protocol configuration. The proposed Phase I effort seeks to establish the feasibility of the two proposed techniques for designing information retrieval protocols by developing a detailed design of the new protocol architecture and analytically evaluating the performance gains offered by the new architecture. Anticipated Benefits: The results of the proposed research can be applied to develop a commercial software product that would allow end-users to easily access information on the National Information Ifrastructure.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Codling moth, Cydia pomonella, is a major exotic pest of walnuts, apples and pears in California.  Current control practices, using the application of conventional pesticides, are costly, toxic and declining in effectivenss.  Of additional concern in California is that many walnut orchards are planted along major river systems in former riparian zones where growers are or will be required to use environmentally safe management practices.  Trichogramma, a minute parasitic wasp completing its development within eggs of host moths, effectively meets this requirement.  Present application methods used in walnuts are not optimal.  Aerial application of Trichogramma parasitoids to the orchard canopy will increase the wasp's success in controlling codling moth, improve crop yields and substantially reduce pesticide applications.  This project proposes to:  1) evaluate existing aerial equipment, modifying or redesigning as necessary, to apply Trichogramma parasitoids to the orchard; 2) evaluate carrier materials and survivability of parasitoids when applied with each unit; 3) evaluate lateral distribution of parasitoids applied by air; and 4) evaluate the addition of glue at application to hold the parasitoids in the canopy, increasing the wasp's successful breeding and subsequent parasitism of codling moth eggs.",

The displays are thin film (2 mm) flexible devices based on poly(diphenyl amine) and structurally related Conducting Polymers (CPs . A uniqe design and unique counter electrode reaction permits very high faradaic reversibility, and the devices are routinely taken to 10**6 cycles over a few days while operating for months. They show a variety of Visible colors, open circuit memory over several weeks, ms switching times, and charge capacity less than 0.0008 C/cm**2. The Phase I work will adapt this technology, using several CP/dopant systems, to fabrication of 3X3, 9-pixel matrices of 1 cm**2 pixels, each individually addressable, and an accompanying controller. The work emphasizes the combined IR+Visible capability of the technology and its flexible, thin film nature. Phase II work will miniaturize to I mm, individually addressable pixels in a 10 cm X 10 cm matrix, employing technology that includes microelectronic fabrication tech- niques. The high dynamic ranges in both Visible and IR regions appear to be unique to these CP systems, not found e.g. in liquid crystals.",

With current resin systems, this is only achievable through elevated cure cycling, translating to added costs throughout the manufacturing process and a reduced composite damage tolerance.  To meet the challenge of high temperature performance with reduced processing costs and increased damage tolerance, Aspen proposes the development of a new class of epoxy resins amenable to room temperature curing.  The proposed system initiates a close functional group packing density, allowing complete conversion at substantially below the polymers final glass transition temperature.  The result is a high temperature, high strength polymer cured at room temperature with enhanced damage tolerance.  Designed from the molecular level, this system represents the leading edge in epoxy functional monomer design research, and the maximum opportunity for significant cost reductions in aerospace quality composite fabrication.

        "abstract": "Abstract         An important facet to a soldier's survivability depends on the clothing worn during combat and training exercises.  Common fibers used in the textile industry, particularly nylons and polyesters, are flammable, produce toxic smoke and are potentially hazardous when worn soldiers.  Flame retardant materials applied directly to these fibers may adversely alter the properties of the fabric and/or degrade through use.  As a result, microencapsulation serves as a viable alternative solution.  Microencapsulation protects the FR material from environmental water and washing; protects it against rugged wear conditions; and protects it against degradation due to heat and sun light; while maintaining the desired properties of the fabric such as breatability, flexibility and strength.  Soldier survivability will be improved by microencapsulating FR materials and incorporating them into textiles used by the U.S. Army including; clothing, tentage and individual equipment.  Aspen Systems' will investigate available FR materials, encapsulation techniques andd incorporation methods through the use of advanced molecular modeling techniques.  The most promising FR materiels will then be microencapsulated and incorporated into new and existing synthetic and natural fibers.  Aspen Systems has teamed with Southwest Research Institute, a recognized leader in microencapsulation technology, to investigate compatible microencapsulation processes and perform microencapsulation of FR materials.",

Our proposed high speed (up to 25,0000 frames per second) camera will be designed as a user friendly device.  It will be made perfectly compatible with the High Speed Test Track (HSTT) site environment, remotely operable and computer controlled.  Included among the attractive camera features are :  Image recording by an electronic array sensor, electrooptical shutter thus no moving mechanical parts, controllable and eyeshade illumination by the laser diode.  To develop the novel camera, Aspen Systems will lead a team of nationally renowned experts in high speed photography, lasers and electrooptics.  In Phase I we will assemble a laboratory prototype of the camera and perform experiments photographing objects obstructed by intense light.  On analyzing the data, a deployable high speed camera will be designed.  In Phase II, the new camera will be fabricated and tested at the HSTT site.",

These algorithms are intended to process and analyze multiple, parallel partial derivative images or \"Jet bundles\" which provide a framework for describing the local structure of objects in images at a point.\r \r The goal of Phase I of this project is to perform the technical research and detailed engineering design of a second stage system to selectively analyze the resulting partial derivative jet bundles from a first stage processor.  It will use both top-down and bottom-up control strategies to selectively perform linear and non-linear vector and matrix operations on the jet bundles.  It will perform these algorithms at real-time video frame rates.  In its final implementation, it will achieve orders of magnitude performance increases over currently available systems by implementing only the operations required to support a specific set of algorithms.",

Improved crystal growth processes will also be possible using reduced growth temperatures, optimized melt compositions, nitrogen doping with ammonia precursors, and rare-earth impurity gettering.

        "abstract": "Abstract         There is much need for lasers with emission wavelengths in the mid-infrared (2 to 5 microns) for applications that include molecular spectroscopy, environmental and atmospheric trace gas analysis, long haul fiber communications, laser surgery, and atmospheric free-space laser transmission. The Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow has reported double heterostructure GaInAsSb/GaAlAsSb lasers emitting at 300 K in the wide wavelength range of 1.8 to 2.4 microns. These devices were fabricated by liquid-phase epitaxy on GaSb substrates. They represent some of the longest emission wavelengths ever reported for uncooled semiconductor injection lasers. To our knowledge, neither this approach, nor similar work, is being pursued in the United States. We aim to apply our expertise in the liquid-phase epitaxy of GaSb-based materials to producing low-cost, high performance GaInAsSb/GaAlAsSb injection lasers. It is our objective to match and improve upon the work of the Russian group, in which case we would be the sole U.S. source for this type of mid-range wavelength semiconductor injection laser. Furthermore, we have developed proprietary epitaxy technologies, previously applied to AlGaAs optoelectronic devices, that should prove very advantageous for GaSb-based lasers, and in particular, for the realization of surface-emitting long-wavelength lasers. Production of low-cost, high-performance mid-infrared GaInAsSb lasers with applications to long-haul optical communications using fluoride fibers, trace gas analysis by molecular spectroscopy for environmental and atmospheric sensing, laser surgery, and atmospheric transmission of laser signals.",

Two breadboard antennas, one broadband and one tunable, would be developed and demonstrated. The broadband element would be no larger than 16\" dia. x 5\" deep and would operate over both the transmit and receive bands simultaneously. The tunable antenna would be significantly smaller, and would use 4 59 6 fixed tuning steps to cover the two bands. Frequency information needed for tuning is shared by the UHF radio and the antenna via a digital interface. Technical objectives include the development of computational models for the antenna concepts, demonstration of two breadboard elements via hardware design, fabrication, and test, and a feasibility analysis based on the results",

This system will enable home care agencies to maximize their human resources and to reduce their service costs. Phase I is to identify the issues dealing with scheduling and coordinating of nurses and home health aides. A pilot system will be implemented and tested as part of the investigation. Phase II will develop a final system based on the pilot system with enhancements. Applying the latest computer graphic, mapping and database technologies, a pilot system which combines street maps with patients and nurses database will be developed. The system will first prepare a list of daily visits for each nurse. Locations of all visits with patients and other related information will be displayed on the mapping screen. A set of procedures will then be applied for creating routes, modifying existing ones, evaluating alternatives, and print route maps and directions. By adding a visual component to the data, a coordinator will be able to effectively match nurses with the services required and reduce driving time.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Audiodontics, Inc., under the support and cooperation of the University of Maryland, has recently developed a hearing aid called the Intraoral Audio Transducer System (IATS).  The IATS uses a miniature actuator of Terfenol-D coupled to a tooth to provide bone conduction sound.  Terfenol-D permits high power transduction with very low voltage and thus a safe system for installation inside the mouth.  In response to the Navy's requirement for improved underwater diver communication. a new application for Audiodontic's developed technology is proposed. Specific aims of the proposed program include: (1) Fabrication of a miniature Terfenol-D actuator which shall be embedded into a diver mouthpiece; (2) Standardization of the bone conduction hearing levels of prototype mouthpiece by sophisticated audiometric tests; (3) Testing the mouthpiece in divers underwater to demonstrate audible sound over a range of frequencies important for speech perception. Audiodontics intends to partner with Benthos, Inc., an underwater equipment specialist, to develop and commercialize the proposed technology.  While Benthos provides the experience and resources for commercialization, Audiodontics supplies the necessary commitment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         AVCON has developed a highly efficient linear motor actuator (LMA) design that has already demonstrated performance that exceeds the power to volume ratio goal of 20 hp/ft3, when operated at high speeds than required for use in moving aircraft flight control surfaces.  Additional engineering will be required to demonstrate the feasibility of achieving an equivalent power to volume ration to reduce operating speeds.  This proposed Phase I effort would investigate the physical phenomena, equations, materials, and manufacturing techniques for our unique coaxial design to determine the feasibility of building an LMA with a power to volume ration of 20hp/ft3, capable of moving 13.75 inches at a no load rate of 7.3 inches per second, with a frequency response of 3 Hz, a maximum output force of 3,000 pounds, and a back drive force of less than 125 pounds at 1.0 inches per second.  After it has been proven feasible to design and build an LMA capable of meeting these requirements, a conceptual design of the actuator and its control system will be developed, based on an input voltage of 270 VDC.  The conceptual design will allow for basic parameters, other than the physical limitation of a 13.75 inch stroke, to be varied so that the design can be optimized. Preliminary heat generation calculations will be performed, and a heat rejection scheme will be developed for a maximum ambient temperature of 160 degrees F (71 C).  A work plan for Phase II will be developed, wherein a more in-depth analysis and design will be performed, and the LMA (including control system) will be fabricated and tested.",

The design of data encoders and decoders will empasize construction with a small number of common application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to be developed in a later phase.

The model designated PASS for \"Parametric Analysis of Naval Ship Systems\" will be unique in as much as it will use algorithms derived from first-principle physics rather than from empirical data to characterize all subsystems and their relationship to the overall ship.  This will be achieved in order to ensure that new technologies are realistically modeled without being biased by existing trends in ship or ship- subsystem design. In each case, the algorithm will characterize the subsystem by weight, volume, function, cost, efficiency or energy consumption, signatures (covertness), survivability, opera- tional effectiveness and the interface with other ship systems, as appropriate. The overall objective shall be to demonstrate a tool that will recognize the (then) current fleet requirements and operational priorities and permit a realistic assess- ment to be made of the cost-benefits of emerging technologies.  The model will incorporate a friendly user-interface to allow easy-use by non-naval architects and will include an analysis module to help the user interpret the results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Rotorcraft limit envelopes are complex and difficult for pilot compliance.  Exceedances are unsafe and shorten useful life of the aircraft, while piloting that isn't close to limits cannot fully exploit performance capabilities.  Accurate, automatic limit-onset prediction/detection would alert the pilot and trigger automatic limit-avoidance control to prevent exceedances.  Neural network (NN) techniques offer the enabling technology for real-time prediction and detection.  Self-designing controller (SDC) technology offers a versatile means for limit avoidance.  The proposed NN synthesis algorithm will select the most relevant sensed variables in a database of flight recordings and evolve a constrained-complexity, nonlinear polynomial neural network.  This NN will recognize the proximity of envelope limits.  The NN limit-onset predictor/detector will be demonstrated in Phase I and combined with the SDC limit-avoidance controller in Phase II.  Barron Associates, Inc. is teamed with Stewart Hughes Ltd., the worldwide leader in systems for rotorcraft health and usage monitoring, and with Analytic Services Inc., who will provide expertise of an experience helicopter test pilot/engineer.

The ultimate goal of this program is to provide the Space & Missile Technology Directorate with a Space Systems Technology Simulation (SSTSim) environment which can address space system development issues at the appropriate scope and level of fidelity throughout all phases of development. The Phase I goals of this program are to both develop AND demonstrate a prototype SSTSim. More specifically, Phase I technical objectives are twofold. First, define SSTSim segments for a strawman satellite on-orbit simulation. Segments include command center, communications network, satellite platform/payload and proctor functions. Second, develop and demonstrate both analysis and realtime interactive operations capabilities of SSTSim.",

A primary focus will be mechanisms that supporteasy-to-construct classifiers, thus enabling research on existing collections of free-text that are nowdifficult to analyze. This approach is exemplar-based: i.e., compare new text with a training set ofpreviously classified texts, and use the classifications of the closest retrieved texts to generatesuggested codes for the new text. Natural language extraction techniques will pre-process texts toassist the retrieval machinery. Phase I will conduct a series of experiments to test the approach, utilizingcoded radiology and pathology reports from Brigham and Women's Hospital and HCHP in Boston. PhaseII will develop a full software prototype and deploy it for on-site evaluation. Advanced retrievaltechniques and expert system back ends for alarming will also be explored in Phase II. The majortechnical innovation is a novel combination of document retrieval and natural language extractiontechnologies to permit easy construction of automated medical text classifiers. The major health-relatedcontribution is an enhanced ability to classify existing free-text records to permit statistical analysis forresearch and clinical quality-measurement initiatives.",

The novel antenna system is of the travelling wave type, it has a planar multilayer design and can be fabricated with the use of printed circuit block (PCR) technology.  The multilayer antenna design consists of two anisotropic electrically controlled layers, and an active layer with low-noise HEMT, HBT transistor amplifiers (receiving or with powerful amplifiers (transmitting) on a dielectric or ceramic substrate with patch radiating and coupling elements above the upper anisotropic layer.  The proposed new concept combines many different functions in one unit:  waveguiding, electromagnetic power distribution, phase-shifting, radiation.  For specific antenna applications, the new design possesses the capability of multibeam and adaptive pattern nulling operation and may be successfully applied in mobile radio communications, as well as in microwave and millimeterwave frequency bands.",

The key to the new technology is the use of novel enzyme-sensitivemembranes coated onto small drug particles, which should allow control over both the time and site ofdrug delivery. This approach should result in reproducible drug delivery to the colon for either localtreatment of colonic diseases or systemic treatment of a number of conditions. Specific goals in PhaseI include identification of suitable enzyme substrates, development of membrane coatings for smallparticles, and demonstration of enzyme-triggered drug release at predictable times. To achieve thesegoals, enzyme substrates and flat-sheet membranes will be screened for appropriate enzyme activity andtransport properties, and then drug beads will be coated with prototype membranes for in vitroevaluation of enzyme-triggered drug release. If this work is successful, a Phase II program will befocused on further development of the technology and in vivo demonstration of site-specific drugdelivery.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Navy ships generate large valumes of graywater and oily wastewaters but most have minimal capacities for storing these wastes. The goal of this program is to develop a membrane-based shipboard graywater-treatment system (GTS) that allows recovery of more than 95% of the wastewater, reducing the volume of wastewater that must be stored by a factor of at least 20. Key to this system is development of a fouling-resistant tube-side-feed module that contains a new type of robust hollow-fiber nanofiltration (NF) membrane. This module will combine the fouling-resistant characteristics of ultrafiltration modules and the high selectivity of NF membranes. In Phase I, feasibility will be demonstrated by 1) developing an NF membrane specifically for graywater treatment, 2) demonstrating the fouling resistance of the module, and 3) demonstrating the effectiveness of backflushing and other operating techniques to minimize fouling. An NF module will be operated on actual graywater generated on ships. In Phase IIF, development of the GTS will be completed and a prototype system will be delivered to the Navy for evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A major source of volatile organic compound emissions into the environment is thevent stream from the glycol-based dehydration units used to remove water fromnatural gas.  A glycol dehydration unit operating on a 50-million SCFD naturalgas stream will typically discharge more than 40 tons per year of varioushazardous volatile organic air pollutants - about half of which is \"BTEX\"(benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes).Bend Research, Inc., proposes to develop a simple and efficient membrane-basedsystem that can be retrofited to the conventional vent condensers currently usedto reduce emissions from glycol dehydrators.  This process will be based on ahollow-fiber pervaporation module that enables the use of a unique system designthat eliminates the problematic wastewater stream produced by conventionalcondenser systems, while also recovering the BTEX.  In Phase I, they willfabricate small modules and operate them in a bench-scale apparatus.  A designbased on the results of these tests, as well as an economic assessment of thistechnology will provide the basis for a decision to proceed into the Phase IIprogram.  By the end of Phase II, they will have field-tested this process incombination with a conventional condenser system.",

Four surface accessibility measurement devices will be designed, fabricated and tested. Existing surface measurement devices, including penetrometers, will also be evaluated. A system for measuring the actual resistance a wheelchair encounters when traveling over a given surface will be fabricated as a reference for the other devices. A wide range of surfaces will be measured with all of the devices, including varieties of indoor carpeting, concrete, dirt, gravel and sand. The data obtained with existing and proposed devices will be compared to the data obtained with the system for measuring surface resistance to wheelchair movement. The measuring device(s) which best correlate(s) with the resistance of a standard wheelchair on a variety of surfaces will be identified. The development of a surface accessibility measurement device that is reliable over a wide range of surfaces will enable experts to disclose the degree of accessibility of indoor and outdoor surfaces. People with mobility limitations, designers, and planners will use this information to determine the degree of accessibility of indoor and outdoor environments.",

Benthos, Inc. proposes a development effort to replace the thruster technology, developed in the 1970s, currently in use on U.S. Navy undersea vehicles, with state-of-the-art thrusters based on this technology. Test prototype vehicles outfitted with thrusters incorporating this technology achieved outstanding thrust performance. Benthos proposes to apply this technology to thrusters which can inexpensively and readily be implemented on existing U.S. Navy assets. Benthos proposes a conservative, low risk, two-phase development program. A Phase I study will collect and evaluate data to determine an optimum design configuration, fully compatible with an existing vehicle. Phase I will include an anlysis of the performance improvements that can be expected when thrusters of this design are applied to the selected vehicles. Phase II includes the fabrication of prototype thruster assemblies and in-water testing to verify the predicted performance improvements. Prototype thrusters would be made availaable for further operational testing. It is anticitpated that the tooling used to produce the prototype thrusters during Phase II will be suitable for immediate use in Phase III production, allowing rapid phasing in to service of the fully developed high performance thrusters.",

The microfabricated sensor chips that are the heart of the technology will respond to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The chips employ ultrasonic measuring principles that have been shown in previous university research to result in extremely high sensitivity; in the work we propose, new techniques will be developed for achieving concomitant selectivity. The use of a silicon technology gives promise of a low-cost manufacture. The chips will be the basis of portable sensor systems that can be used for on-site VOC pollutant monitoring. The technology is generic in the sense that it can be applied later to the detection of other types of pollutants. In this phase we will design and build a chemical identification chip incorporating an ultrasonic flexural-plate-wave sensor and other micro-machined elements. We will design and test circuitry and algorithms to control the individual chip elements in order to make a chemical-measurement system. System performance will be measured upon exposure to two different volatile organic compounds in the presence of water vapor.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         BRC and its Consulting Partner Murray State University (MSU) are proposing an innovative approach to the near real-time generation of environmental effects such as dust, smoke, fog, rain and haze based upon an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) technique that has been proven to provide realistic renderings in its simplest form. This technique creates 'Fractal-Like' complexity through the use of a mathematical equation that relies on a collection of fixed and random coefficients to the scene. Because the survivability of any TMD asset is greatly affected by the nature of its environment, there is a critical need for a way to simulate these effects in real time. Using the proposed technique, the Government will be able, for the first time, to render fully photo-realistic, real-time environments in its TMD simulations. The Result will be the generation of better simulations that allow valid survivability studies to be performed. This Phase I outlines a 6 month program to prove the viability of the ARMA technique for enhancing TMD simulations. This technique will revolutionize the way that DIS simulations are rendered and improve the validity of survivability studies using the DIS environment. The private sector will have many uses for this technology in the entertainment and video industry.",

This research describes a novelmercury fiber electrode that maintains the advantages of mercury as an electrode material and eliminatesthe problems associated with measurement in biological samples. This design places mercury inside asmall diameter dialysis tube which can be directly dipped into a sample or it can be put in a flow streamfor on line detection. The aims of this proposal is to characterize this electrode's performance; detectionlimits, precision and linearity of the lead ion response in the presence of interfering substances foundin blood samples such as proteins and oxygen. The results of this research could lead to a portable,automated analyzer that could be used in the field or laboratory. In addition, many procedures have beendeveloped using mercury electrodes and the analyzer could also be used to determine lead and othermetals from environmental samples. The design also may have applications as a detector for liquidchromatographs for the determination of difficult to reduce substances.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Military personnel are vulnerable to many biological agents, such as bacteria, bacterial toxins and viruses, in the field.  These agents must be detected rapidly to allow prompt treatment of infected personnel.  These agents may be detected using either immunological (antibody-antigen) or genomic (DNA) diagnostics. Such techniques as ELISA, latex bead agglutination kits or radio-labeled probes require multiple incubations, careful washes and well-trained technicians.  Ideally, a field test, requiring a single step, should provide immediate (a few minutes) feedback. One approach, which currently allows the rapid (<5 minutes) detection of minute quantities (~10 ng/mL) of antigen, antibody or DNA, employs a piezoelectric biosensor for the immunological or genomic detection of the target biochemical agent.  The resonant frequency of the piezoelectric device is observed as the biochemical surface reaction progresses.  With reasonable improvements in the measurement electronics, higher frequency operation and the improved design of the SHAPM device, BIODE anticipates the sensitivity could be improved by as much as 100-fold (<100 pg) during the Phase I study.  Further progressive improvements are expected as the development effort continues.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The poultry industry is dependent on efficient reproduction.  Reproduction of broiler lines increasingly is a problem and already is limiting for turkeys.  Currently, breeders or producers can identify males of low fertility only retrospectively after a costly failure.  However, elimination of the 25-35% of males likely to be of lowest fertility before they were turned in with hens would increase fertility by 10 percentage units.  Such culling presently is impossible because there is no simple, low cost test which is reasonably predictive of fertility of a rooster or turkey tom.  This project will develop an assay for field measurement of the combined attribute of sperm motility plus sperm binding to a substrate prepared from a purified extract from unfertilized chicken eggs.  The assay to be developed mimics, in vitro, the initial binding of a rooster spermatozoon to the vitelline membrane of an unfertilized hen's egg.  Early preliminary data demonstrate a strong relationship (r^2 = 0.81) between sperm binding to the microwell used for a prototype assay and fertility of the same semen.  Two Objectives will be addressed in Phase I.  Sperm from roosters of unknown fertility or from lines selected for high or low fertility will be used in 3 experiments with the goal of developing a repeatable and sensitivity fluorescent, microwell sperm-binding assay.  The 4th experiment will demonstrate feasiblity of the assay by showing, in a predictive manner, that roosters designated as \"bad\" or \"good\" on the basis of the newly developed assay differ in fertility and that, for a simulated population, sperm binding is predictive of fertility.",

The focus of Phase I studies will be development of standard protocols for generating suchmini-libraries. Two amplification strategies are proposed based on their use of recognition sitesdistributed throughout the human genome at about 250 bp intervals (insuring representative coverageof genomic sequences in the min-library). The strategies are based on DNA sequence recognition byMbo I cleavage and by oligonucleotide hybridization to the most common 6 bp sequences in the humangenome. DNA products obtained from both strategies are PCR amplified with a single adaptoroligonucleotide. The products of the amplification reactions will be analyzed for the amount and sizeof DNA, degree of genome coverage, hybridization specificity, retrievability upon reamplification, easeof use and reproducibility. Based on amplification strategies developed in Phase I, we will ultimatelymake available to the human genom research community standardized reagents that can be used: a) forobtaining region-specific clones (i.e., genomic clones for contig assembly/map closure, and/or cDNAclones to identify novel genes), b) as starting material for isolation of region-specific STSs, and c) ashybridization/amplification targets for subchromosome localization.",

This assay system will be based on a novel dry reagentparamagnetic particle-based assay technology that has recently been applied successfully to wholeblood, bedside monitoring of prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time testing. Thedry reagent assay consists of paramagnetic iron oxide particles whose oscillations in an imposedmagnetic field will be dampened by the formation of a fibrin clot around the particles. The clotting timein turn is related to the concentration of thrombin inhibitor present in the blood sample. Specific aimsinclude: (1) compare the aPPT-based assay with a thrombin-based test system; (2) refine the prototypeaPPT-based hirudin assay or thrombin time-based assay by test card optimization and testing; (3) developalgorithms for rapid calibration and standardization to a reference method; and (4) study the effects ofpotential influencing factors on the assay and determine performance characteristics. Introduction ofa rapid, convenient assay system for antithrombin drugs at the patient point-of-care could provide resultsearlier than existing and newly-emerging laboratory methods and could serve as an important diagnosticguide during therapy.",

CURRENTLY, USE OF HTCA'S IS LIMITED TO TUMOR SPECIMENS OBTAINED AT DIAGNOSIS OR AT OVERT RELAPSE. AN IDEAL SITUATION WOULD BE TO TEST METASTATIC CELLS PRIOR TO RELAPSE BEFORE DRUG RESISTANCE IS A FACTOR. THIS SITUATION IS FEASIBLE BY OBTAINING SMALL NUMBERS OF TUMOR CELLS FROM THE BONE MARROW OF PATIENTS WITH A VARIETY OF SOLID TUMORS. THE APPLICANTS HAVE DEVELOPED AN HTCA THAT PERMITS THE CLONOGENIC GROWTH OF TUMOR CELLS FROM THE BONE MARROW OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS HTCA METHOD ARE: 1) TESTING CAN BE PERFORMED AT ALL STAGES OF DISEASE WHEN METASTATIC CELLS ARE PRESENT IN MARROW; 2) SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY MAY BE IMPROVED BECAUSE METASTASES IN MARROW MAY REPRESENT AN AGGRESSIVE CLONE OF CELLS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF OTHER SYSTEMIC METASTASES; AND 3) SERIAL TESTING CAN BE PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY EMERGING DRUG RESISTANCE AS TREATMENT PROCEEDS. THIS MARROW HTCA IS ALSO FELT TO BE IDEAL FOR IN VITRO PHARMACOLOGIC TESTING OF NEW COMPOUNDS AGAINST HUMAN METASTATIC TUMOR CELLS IN THEIR NATURAL MARROW MICROENVIRONMENT AND FOR VERIFICATION OF TUMOR CELL REMOVAL BY VARIOUS MARROW-PURGING TECHNIQUES.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This research project will develop a unique, high-power, 30 amp hour (Ah) rechargeable battery for a variety of commercial and military applications. The performance characteristics of this technology have produced the highest specific peak power of any known battery technology, producing power levels in excess of 5000 Watts/kilogram (W/kg) and 16,000 Watts/liter (W/1). In addition, this unique Thin Metal Film technology has produced cells with the lowest internal impedance, for its size, of any known rechargeable battery technology using any chemistry. These cells are capable of being recharged to the 80% level in 3 minutes and fully recharded in approximately 10 minutes. This technology has been successfully demonstrated with small 1.5 Ah cells. The technical objective of the proposed project is to determine the optimum cell configuration, design and manufacturability requirements to scale this technology from a cell size of 1.5 Ah to 30 Ah. In accomplishing this, the basic chemistry utilizes the lowest cost raw materials of any rechargeable battery technology. In addition, all the materials are not just commonly recyclable, but are fully reusable within the battery industry. Anticipated Benefits: Batteries exhibiting this power capability could make an important, cost effective contribution to the development of electric vehicles. They could either be the sole energy storage device or the power component of a hybrid system.",

This is an inefficient and labor intensive method for detemining fruit quality, in need of automation.  It has recently been determined that visible and near infrared multispectral imaging is useful for extracting several fruit quality characteristics.  In order to acquire information in several bands as fruit is processed, a high throughput high-speed tunable optical filter is required.  While acousto-optic filters are adequately fast tuning, image quality is poor, clear apertures are small, and image registration is not maintained.  BNS proposes a ferroelectric liquid crystal tunable optical filter which combines speed comparable to acousto-optic filters, with large clear apertures, large acceptance angles, and excellent image quality.  This device, used with a single CCD camera, provides a wealth of information, not attainable using visual inspection, in a non-intrusive manner.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal deals with the growth of a relatively new class of photorefractive semiconductor, Vanadium Doped ZnTe, which has fast response at relatively low intensity and high sensitivity required for real-time applications. Brimrose Corporation, in collaboration with the Center for Photonic Technology at The University of Southern California and Hughes Research Laboratories, Malibu, California, has in recent years produced ZnTe:V crystals and reported photorefractivity in this material for the first time. Our preliminary study indicates that ZnTe is an outstanding photorefractive material with a sensitivity range expanding from 0.6um to beyond 1.3um. Available ferroelectric oxides and sillenites do not have required efficient response beyond visible wavelengths. Moreover, these classes of materials lack the sensitivity and speed of response necessary for real time applications at low laser power levels. Semiconductors such as GaAs and CdTe are demonstrated to have a sensitive and fast response; however, their energy band gaps limit their use to wavelengths longer than 0.9um. The large band gap III-V and II-V semiconductors such as GaP, CdS, and ZnTe have the potential for sensitive operation in the wavelength range of O.57um to 1.3um. A comparison of the figures of merit n3r/Er, corresponding to the electro-optic index change per separated charges suggests the highest sensitivity in ZnTe. The superior sensitivity of ZnTe with respect to other materials is now confirmed through our preliminary experimental findings. During Phase I, the major emphasis will be placed on the purification of the starting material, determination of optimum doping concentration of vanadium for operation in the wavelength range of 0.8um to 0.85um and the growth of photorefractive ZnTe Crystals. The crystals will be grown by Physical Vapor Transport (PVT) technique which has already been standardized at Brimrose. The major emphasis will be on the growth of large crystals (at least 6mm to 8mm3) with the diffraction efficiencies better than 3%. The crystals grown using PVT will be characterized with respect to crystallographic defects as well as electrical and photorefractive properties. Sam",

Inside the device, a tunable electro-optic Fabry-Perot provides very narrow optical bandpass and an acousto-optic tunable filter suppresses the unwanted periodic Fabry-Perot bandpass and enable the broad band tuning.  We should call this device electro-acousto-optic Fabry-Perot (EAOFP).  The filter can be continually tuned between 1-5 um with very high spectral resolution 0.01 cm-1 (0.176 a @ 4.2 um).  Some of the salient features include solid state device, fast tuning speed 10 us, high optical throughout, high extinction ratio 1000;1, high spatial resolution (>200 lines/mm) for spectral imaging applications, large field of view angle (up to 40 deg) compact and rugged.  Also, this filter can be programmed to simultaneously pass arbitrarily selected multiple wavelengths for implementing powerful matched filtering algorithms.",

This requires an innovative magnetic structure design that differs from the Russian SPT designs which typically operate at a minimum power level several times greater than that appropriate for LightSats.  In Phase I we propose to design the Hall thruster, fabricate and test it in our existing vacuum facility.  The preliminary objective is to demonstrate a stable discharge at the appropriate voltage. Parameters to be measured discharge current and voltage.  The data will be used in concurrent analysis to estimate its thrust, Isp and efficiency.  The Phase I results will prove the feasibility of the low power Hall thruster, removing risk from the Phase II program.  In Phase II, the Hall thruster will be fully characterized including measurement of thrust.  A flight weight version will be designed, fabricated and tested.

        "abstract": "Abstract         A novel nondestructive inspection (NDI) technique is proposed for detecting surface flaws beneath a thin coating. The basic technique relies on the abililty of laser holography to detect very small surface displacements due to thermal expansion effects caused by a propagating thermal pulse. The technique is closely related to the method of infrared imaging which employs an infrared video camera to detect temperature changes due to an expanding heat pulse. The technique being proposed will have greater resolution than infrared imaging due to the very high sensitivity of the holographic detection mechansim which will allow for the detection fine surface cracks. A further advantage of the Laser Holography Thermal Pulse Propagation (LHTPP) techcnique is that it can be used for all material systems including ferromagnetic, non ferromagnetic, insulators and conductors. In addition LHTPP readily lends itself to computer automation. Currently existing image analysis codes can be directly applied to the storage, enhancement and analysis of the holographic data. This will allow for the development of convenient field units for on site testing as well stationary laboratory setups.",

They can be used to convertany high-resolution monochromatic camera into a multispectral camera. On the other hand, these liquidcrystal tunable filters (LCTF's) presently offer rather low throughput (10 to 25%) which limits theirusefulness in photon-limited fluorescence applications. Our aim is to determine the feasibility ofdeveloping a new type of liquid crystal tunable filter with efficiency of 70% or more. Improvements inefficiency will accrue mainly from: 1) use of a novel optical configuration that filters all input polarizationstates instead of just one linear polarization state; and 2) improving the efficiency of our liquid crystaltunable waveplates.",

Oral vaccines present a means of delivery which is both convenient to the patient and conservative to time and money for medical personnel charge with administration of vaccination programs.  A successful oral vaccine, for maximum efficacy, should 1) delivery antigen over an extended period to obviate the necessity of booster doses, I.e.x require only on dose, and 2) be targeted to the specific tissues in the gut which are responsible for the development of immunity.  The work described herein proposes an oral-controlled delivery of immunity.  The work described herein proposes an oral-controlled delivery system targeted to the lymphoid tissue of the ileum Peyer's patches) by means of selected bioadhesives.  Although concerned specifically with the antigens selected by DoD, the approach can be applied to a wide varity of antigens.  Such site specific trageting which delivers immunity in one dose can enable vaccination programs to reach into communities both in this country and in the developing nations more effeciently and at less expense.",

RRP is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), and ischaracterized by recurrent, nonmalignant, proliferative lesions of the larynx. Patients with RRP typicallyundergo numerous microsurgical procedures to remove laryngeal papilloma threatening airway patency.The standard surgical technique involves CO2 laser vaporization of laryngeal epithelium affected by thelesions, and requires general anesthesia. We will illustrate the pulsed dye laser can be used to induceregression of laryngeal papilloma in an a traumatic manner. It has already been shown that the pulseddye laser is effective in clearing HPV lesions of the skin (verrucae). The pulsed dye laser radiation is fibercompatible, and may be delivered using a flexible intranasal laryngoscope and local anesthesia. Potentialadvantages of the pulsed dye laser treatment over CO2 laser surgery include (1) reduced morbidity,especially a lower risk of laryngeal scarring, (2) lower cost, (3) reduced technical difficulty, and (4)reduced risk of viral dissemination or transmission.",

The proposed research explores the feasibility of using an aqueous dispersion of film-forming and water-displacing compounds to yield corrosion inhibiting films with excellent adhesion to metals, primers and coatings.  The proposed CPC formulations, although waterborne, would possess the ability to displace absorbed water from the surfaces of poorly treated metallic substrates and exclude water from the coating-metal interface.  The interaction of the proposed coating components and hydrated metal surfaces will be computer simulated to optimize the water displacing properties and guide the formulation work.  The VOC-compliant coatings would be tested against conventional solventborne CPCs for water displacing ability, adhesion and corrosion inhibition.  The ability to form strongly adherent, durable barrier coatings over poorly treated structural metal alloys without the need for volatile organic solvents would represent a significant advancement in corrosion engineering and naval aircraft maintenance technology.",

The low cost pressure infiltration process will be combined with commercial technology for producing high thermal conductivity, high stiffness, low CTE, carbon-carbon composite preforms using low cost carbon fiber raw material.  The resultant composite material will have a significantly lower cost and similar properties when compared to traditional carbon fiber reinforced composites produced using high cost carbon fibers.  Cast Metal Composites will use its pressure infiltration process to produce 3 to 5 test coupon samples, nominally 3.000\" diameter x 0.100\" thick, using each of two low cost carbon-carbon preform material types supplied commercially and a low viscosity, liquid cyanate ester resin.  The thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and elastic modulus of the composite materials will be measured. The results will be compared to those predicted by applicable composite theory.  A detailed final report will be submitted at the end of this Phase I effort.",

The project will demonstrate the feasibility of using commercial receivers and evaluate the accuracy and applicability of these measurements for improvements in HF propagation. For this we propose to survey the available receivers and select one or more for demonstration. We develop the software for converting GPS measurements to TEC. This software will include phase averaging of the pseudorange to improve TEC accuracy, satellite and receiver bias removal, and time averaging. Furthermore, we address issues on security plan, multipath mitigation and calibration. Along with TEC measurements we also investigate the utilization of phase and amplitude scintillation data. We thoroughly address various approaches and particularly the use of physical ionospheric models for improving the prediction of HF ionospheric parameters at the remote location.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose a wireless (HF band) network integrated with existing wireline network system which could be used as an extension of the wireline network. The system should handle both voice and data, should conform to the existing and future wireline protocols, could be easily reconfigured and should provide robust and secure means of communication in battlefield and in areas where wirelines do not exist. Conventional HF channel cannot support high data rate over sustained period of time. We propose to use short packets over many parallel paths and use adaptive control in real time. A major innovation is proposed for the efficient use of the HF channel using a novel \"intelligent node controller.\" This controller utilizes a physical model of the ionosphere and predicts the spatial and temporal variations of the ionospheric channel. The inverse channel transfer function derived from the model is used in an improved RAKE architecture. Utilization of multipath and multi-routing capabilities allow highly increased throughput and parallel control over these channels and are provided through the node controller. These features are integrated with the overall networking scheme. During Phase I we shall design the intelligent node controller which will significantly improve the throughput of the H.F. channel. Complete system will be built and demonstrated during Phase II. Anticipated Benefits: HF network could be a valuable extension of the Global-Grid concept. This would provide a cost-effective alternative in sparsely populated areas and in various sectors of DoD. Commercial application exists in maritime, aviation, highway, railways and particularly during emergencies.",

The program will advance state of the art technology for FGMs, with a fabrication method adaptable to high volume, low cost production, in contrast to other reported processes.  The new program will investigate ballistic effects of varying levels of titanium metal content in cermet TiB/Ti FGMs, and evaluation through V50 testing against 800 grain fragment simulating and .50 caliber AP projectile threats.  Three cermet TiB compositions will be used as hardface materials for the FGMs, with titanium contents of 5,10, and 15 percent.  Modeling of residual stresses, performed by UES, Inc., wil be used to maximize hardface thickness.  Fabrication method will be hot pressing, including a Cercom-developed, modified tape casting process to tailor intermediate layers.  Tile size will be 150mm square, with scale up to 300mm square in an Option Task.  Attachment of one FGM tile to a metallic base will be demonstrated.

        "abstract": "Abstract         In recent years, major advances have been made in nearly all areas of microelectronics development, including silicon technology, software development, and chip architecture. The one key area that has been more-or-less neglected however is packaging. The technology of packaging minature electronics such that they do not overheat is now the limiting factor in miniaturization. Experimental evaluation of the thermal management of Miniature Multi-Chip Modules (MCMs) and their board/system assemblies can be expensive and time consuming. A novel Virtual Prototyping Environment (VPE) for multi-scale thermal packaging and testing of MCMs and their assemblies is proposed.  It involves CAD technology, Virtual Parts Repository, grid generation, heat transfer and cooling media fluid mechanics solver, visualization tools, a thermal stresses module and Property Data Bank. It will allow rapid \"virtual assembly\" of chips, substrates, interconnects, and encapsulation components of MCM's and their thermal simulation, including thermal cycling and thermal stresses. An electronic component supplier, with the proposed VPE, could deliver a \"virtual chip: for system virtual integration before the hardware is shipped. In Phase I, the flow and heat transfer solver will be adapted and demonstrated for thermal packaging and thermal cycling testing of MCMs. A Virtual Parts Repository will be designed. Results of the Phase I effort and the VPE concept will be presented to SEMATECH, the U.S. electronic industry and academic Microelectronics Packaging Centers. Potential teaming/co-funding arrangements will be explored for Phases II and III. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The developed computational environment will help in design and thermal cycling testing of MCM's and MCM assemblies. The proposed Virtual parts Repository/Assembly will allow component suppliers to produce \"virtual chips\" before hardware is delivered for real assembly. The technology will be actively promoted in U.S. electronics, computer, automotive, telecommunication, and defense markets.",

In order to predict the structural vibrations responsible for the acoustic radiation, the wavenumber/frequency spectrum of the pressure fluctuations must be known. Experimental data and analytical methods to predict surface pressure spectra currently exist only for simple flows.  A computational tool is proposed here to predict surface pressure fluctuations in turbulent flow over practical flow configurations.  Large eddy simulation (LES) methodology will be developed and validated for multi-domain body- fitted curvilinear BFC grids in Phase I with particular emphasis given to the issue of filtering on BFC grids.  The LES methodology will be extended to hybrid (structured/unstructured) grids in Phase H. The Phase I study will demonstrate the feasibility of LES methodology with a finite volume formulation on BFC grids for predicting surface pressure fluctuations on simple flows.  The effect of grid skewness on accuracy of LES predictions will be assessed and recommendations will be made for further development and validation in Phase H. The Phase III study will compare the accuracy and computational requirements to calculate more complex flows with structured, unstructured, and hybrid grids.",

The resultant CFD code will be based on the solution of the full Navier-Stokes equations with advanced turbulence and combustion modeling and will utilize a rocket plume model for capturing the shape and characteristics of the ejection seat rocket plumes. In Phase I, a 2D axi-symmetric rocket plume model will be developed to investigate ejection seat rocket nozzle and plume flows and their effects on surrounding flow field.      Several techniques will be investigated for prescribing initial and boundary conditions within the three-dimensional ejection seat computational environment.  The rocket plume model will be validated against experimental data for   a wide range of free stream flow speeds.  Also in Phase I, the rocket plume model will be loosely incorporated into the ejection seat computational environment and a demonstration calculation will be made for an ejecting   seat with rocket power on. Several techniques for adaptive and/or local grid  refinement, controllable propulsion and multi-nozzle systems will be studied  for development/adaptation in Phase II. In Phase II, the rocket plume capability will be tightly incorporated into the ejection seat computational environment and the resultant CFD code will be extensively validated against wind Tunnel test data.  Capability for multiple rocket propulsion and modulation of thrust levels will also be incorporated in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         High performance military aircraft operating in the hypersonic regime produce large heat loads that can only be managed with endothermic fuels.  However, the current knowledge of endothermic chemistry in fuels and its effects over a range of aircraft flight conditions is extremely limited.  The proposed Phase I study is aimed at the development of advanced finite rate models to characterize dehydrogenation (endothermic) reactions that occur on the catalyst surface.  Data generated at Pratt & Whitney on an experimental prototype system will be used to develop, calibrate and validate endothermic chemistry model.  The chemistry model will be incorporated into an advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code to facilitate the coupled analysis of fluid flow, heat/mass transfer and chemical reactions in fuel lines.  The coupled model will be used to perform detailed parametric studies to evaluate the performance of the cooling system over a range of operating conditions.  The parameters that will be studied in Phase I are the fuel flow rate, the heat load on the fuel, the operating temperature and the fuel/catalyst combination.  In Phase II, the model will be extended to include the effects of multi-component supercritical states and thermal pyrolysis of the fuel.",

The focus will be on subsystem contribution to pilot SA in the critical beyond-visual-range (BVR) to within-visual range (WVR) merge, and the goal will be to develop a quantitative computable metric which can be embedded in a large-scale engagement level model, such as the Man-in-the-Loop Air-to-Air System Performance Evaluation Model (MIL-AASPEM).  The proposed approach combines an integrated crew/system-model of pilot SA, with a pilot-centered metric that measures the disparity between the actual situation and the model-generated one.  The crew/system model formalizes the SA process and builds upon our earlier work in modeling pilot SA during the BVR phase.  It will make use of object-oriented software to facilitate later incorporation in MIL-AASPEM.  We propose a three task effort: (1) develop a prototype of the crew/system model and metric; (2) develop and demonstrate a scenario focusing on the BVR/WVR merge; and (3) specify requirements for full-scale development and validation.",

The approach combines empirical knowledge elicitation techniques and graphical model visualization tools in a structured methodology.  The knowledge elicitation techniques will consist primarily of indirect techniques, designed to access implicit and perceptually-encoded knowledge that is thought to underlie expert decision-making.  Graphical displays representing the mental models will be designed based on the data obtained from battlefield domain experts.  These displays will be embedded in an object-oriented interactive graphical user-interface system that will facilitate the rapid display and manipulation of these structures, including visualization of a given situation from multiple perspectives, at different points in time, and at varying levels of granularity and abstraction, to capture the types of flexible manipulation of these structures that expert decision makers are able to perform with their mental models.  This work will naturally fit within a broader context of a hybrid approach to the problem of mental model determination, which would include a computational modeling component in Phase II, focusing on the refinement and validation of the inferred models through further empirical testing of model-derived hypotheses.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Many man-machine interface features of the modern unmanned ground vehicle control station require sophisiticated trade-offs be made. For instance, the need to transmit video information from a vehicle for teleoperation greatly exceeds the current capability of military radios to transmit this information. The remote operator needs advanced video compression techniques to support low data rate and supervised driving modes which involve trading off bandwidth with temporal lag, image resolution, and frame update rate. This proposal advocates the development of an approach to control interface design based on operator focus of attention modeling. Our approach is to enhance early man-machine interface (MMI) definition through a virtual reality environment for UGV control which supports implementation of a rapid succession of prototype user control interfaces. These MMIs inherently incorporate metering, i.e. quantitative measurement of operator performance for benchmark mission activities. The overall approach leverages the current art in constructing virtual reality systems and new technology in human operator response metering developed at Cybernet (for DARPA). Also work now underway at Cybernet to develop an advanced multiple vehicle operator control station for DEMO II provides an ideal path for technology migration into main line US Army UGV program activities later.",

Significant advances in photo-realistic image rendering has made reasonably priced high performance computer generated visuals commonplace.  While development of the visual aspect of a virtual world is a significant artistic enterprise, it is no longer technically difficult.  Similarly, computer capture and generation of digitized sound, management of sound resources, and playback and 3D placement of sounds in a virtual environment is straight forward.  However, virtualization of motion (kinesthetic and haptic) cues is in its infancy.  In this proposed work we will perform the basic trade analysis, design, and simulation of a system to provide full body digitally programmed kinesthetic display.  The proposing group is ideally suited for this task because we already have industries most mature kinesthetic display systems architecture commercially in-place, built kinesthetic devices for seat, hand, arm, finger and head action display, and have experience integrating high-end VR systems which combine visualizations, sound synthesis, and kinesthetic display.  In this effort we will integrate current technology and extend it to provide full body kinesthetic display functions to simulate locomotion for dismounted troops under virtual training/exercises scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Beta-Carotene is widely used in the food industry as a food colorant and vitamin supplement, and it is rapidly gaining popularity for its reported anti-cancer potency.  Medical studies indicates that Beta-carotene is preventative and sometimes terapeutic against malignant tumors, lung cancer, colon cancer, esophagus cancer, and skin cancer.\r \r It is the focus of this proposal to develop a new separation process for recovery of natural carotene from carotene-containing vegetable oils such as palm oil.  Conventional methods for this separation include liquid/liquid extraction, liquid chromatography, and packed-bed adsorption.  Conventional liquid/liquid extraction is undesirable because of the tendency to form stable emulsions--leading to loss of solvents and expensive waste treatment.  Chromatography and packed-bed processes have problems of bed compression and high pressure drops.  The process that we propose to develop utilizes a highly selective carotene-complexing agent in a membrane-extraction process.  This process promises to be superior to conventional technology because it allows emulsion-free liquid/liquid extraction.  In addition, the proprietary complexing agent promises to have very high selectivity and capacity for this separation.  In Phase I our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of the novel approach for recovery of natural carotene from palm oil.  We will characterize the process with respect to operating variables, and we will produce sufficient natural carotene from palm oil to allow extensive chemical testing.",

EVITA addresses the extension of the previous eye-voice interface research into the the three-dimensional graphic environment, addition of dynamic user-controlled recalibration to achieve consistent pointing accuracy, and of generating modular, standardized software components in order to make the EVITA interface readily adaptable to a maximum diversity of UNIX-based applications. In the proposed Phase I effort, a complete design for an EVITA interface will be produced and implemented in an experimental testbed. Alternative methods for providing interaction with the third spatial dimension (depth) will be developed along with alternative techniques for making menu selection; experiments will be designed and conducted in Phase I to guide the selection between these alternatives.",

Our proposed system, HINTS, is designed to use HUMS diagnostic outcomes and mission-based cognitive modeling to derive coherent crew options and recommendations for action.  Our technology will build on ONR's Air Vehicle Diagnostic System program successes and provide the crew with timely, meaningful data and proposed problem solutions. HINTS will present alerts of impending mechanical system problems on a helmet-mounted display (HMD).  The alerts will be triggered by intelligent algorithms derived from the AVDS program, employing neural network and expert system technologies.  HINTS will enable the aircrew to obtain data on intermediate analyses and sensor data summaries in order to aid in the verification and interpretation of the original alerts.  This ability to obtain elaborating data will also be extendedto provide electronic technical manual and embedded training components.  In order to enable the aircrew to interact with the HMD, HINTS will incorporate a control channel for which both voice and manual control options will be investigated.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We will use two approaches to produce new near infrared (nir) dyes for use as fluorescent probes for biological sensing.  The first approach will build on the experience of the laboratory of Dr. Leslie Loew in the development of fluorescent dyes based on the aminostyryl pyridinium chromophore and its analogs.  These dyes have extraordinary Stokes shifts and, when bound to biological macromolecules or molecular assemblies, high quantum yields.  The second approach exploits the newly emerging technology revolving around luminescent lanthanide chelates and cryptates.  These compounds employ energy transfer between the ligand and the metal ion which then emits a nir photon with a long (0.1 to 10 ms) luminescence lifetime, making them ideal for time-gated detection schemes.  All new dyes will be fully characterized by mass spectroscopy, nmr and elemental analysis.  Also, absorbance and emission spectra, fluorescence quantum efficiencies and fluorescence lifetimes will be measured.  Because near infrared light is becoming readily and cheaply available through new diode laser and led technologies, is less destructive to tissue, has better penetrating ability and is less subject to interference from background light, these compounds will be of tremendous utility in conjunction with new micro fluorescence detection modalities being developed by Ciencia and elsewhere.",

Today, the endoscopic surgery revolution is just beginning to affectneurosurgery, but it shows great promise. Present endoscopic methods, however, severely limit thevariety and size of surgical instruments that can be used, and provide only monocular vision. PhaseI will develop a set of instruments that will combine the minimally invasive advantages of endoscopywith the manipulative advantages of microsurgery, allowing the neurosurgeon to utilize existingmicrosurgical skills -- guided by miniaturized optics -- to perform complex intracranial procedures withimproved vision through minimal surgical exposures. In Phase I, unique endoscopic microsurgicalinstruments will be developed and tested. The successful completion of this work will set the stage forcreating another revolutionary advance in neurosurgical technique. The resulting decrease in themorbidity and cost of complex intracranial neurosurgical procedures should be significant.",

The residual requirements for serum proteins will then be replacedwith hormones, growth factors, attachment factors, carrier proteins and supplemental nutrients asneeded for optimal growth in a defined medium. Proliferation of smooth muscle cells at inappropriatelocations within the lumens of arteries plays a major role in the pathology of atherosclerosis. Recentresearch has shown that highly diverse chemical signals arising from several other cell types in responseto dietary factors and minor vascular injury interact in complex ways to influence that growth. Theavailability of a highly-defined commercially-produced medium will greatly facilitate analysis of responseshuman vascular smooth muscle cells to the large numbers of different signaling molecules that arecurrently believed to exert regulatory effects on their proliferation. Because bronchial smooth musclecells grow well in the serum-supplemented medium for vascular smooth muscle cells, we anticipate thatthey will also grow well in the defined medium that is to be developed, with no more than minormodifications in the formulation.",

A new Total Veriation based, feature-accurate approach to basic image processing tasks has been developed by Cognitech researchers.  These image processing tasks include video restoration, frame matching, expansion, sharpening, and image measurements.  Numerical instability is overcome by computing solutions of time-dependent, nonlinear PDE's with or without degradation constraints.  Moreover, TV based image processing delivers accurate estimation of singularities, i.e. computed image features are a numerically accurate approximation of true image features.  Only when the accuracy of all singular image features is assured can an algorithm be used as a serious investigation tool for identification of subjects within the surveillance video.  Real life surveillance videos are low resolution, noisy, and blurry.  The subject to be identified may be captured by only a small pixel area on each video field.  We are proposing an analytic and nonlinear PDE-based fast computational discrete technique for \"frame fusion\", which is multiscale, accurate, and occlusion capturing.  This technique will incorporate video degradations such as motion, out-of-focus atmospheric blurs, as well as recording noise and distortions.",

High-spatial resolution 3-D coverage for several km around the lidar location will be possible at updates of a few minutes, depending on the measurement grid size and the lidar PRF. The lidar would be capable of performing localized scans to probe the winds in specific areas in great detail and at faster update rates.  In the proposed effort CTI will develop an autonomously-operating coherent solid-state lidar system.  During the Phase I effort, analysis, computer simulations, and demonstration measurements, aimed at proving feasibility for the autonomous eyesafe lidar will be performed.  Algorithms for fusion of the lidar data with radar data will be developed.  The preliminary designed of the coherent lidar windfield sensor will be performed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We introduce an innovative laser which brings inherently new capabilities to lidar that were not available with other coherent lidar laser sources.  The unique design of this laser allows production of a greater range of pulse widths and energies than was previously obtainable from a single source.  This 1.56 um eye-safe laser utilizes an intracavity Solid State Raman Shifter (SSRS) which is pumped by an energy-efficient Nd:YAG laser.  The SSRS system utilizes a proven, power scalable design.  SSRS provides an alternative to using 1.064 um Nd:YAG lasers with gaseous D2 Raman shifters.  Important differences between SSRS and OPO's include the fact that SSRS devices do not require phase matching, have no acceptance product design margins, can have high quantum efficiencies, do not require the use of high quality pump beams to obtain efficient, diffraction limited output.  In this proposed effort, we will develop efficient SSRS transmitter source suitable for both direct and coherent detection-mode lidars (a \"dual-mode\" lidar).  Phase I of the program demonstrates frequency control of the SSRS system via injection seeding.  Dual-detection mode lidars provide a means of optimizing system sensitivity in changing scenarios.  Performance analyses for both direct and coherent detection will be performed.  Incorporation of the new source into existing lidar systems will be addressed in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this proposed SBIR research project is to develop the technology which will enable the production of affordable, lightweight, highly conductive polymer composite electronic packaging (i.e., electronic housings and heat sinks).  The research will center on predominately polymer matrix composite materials and how various material designs can be utilized in various structural/thermal configurations to produce electronic housings and heat sinks that exceed the performance requirements of current aluminum electronic housings and metallic heat sinks (and at one-half the weight).  This research will leverage off work initiated by COI, namely:  1.  COI's STD ATR card guide made from both low and highly conductive polymer matrix composite materials was successfully tested for greater thermal performance and half aluminum STD STR weight.  2.  COI's SNAPSAT (TM) technology has demonstrated that polymer composites structural components can be as affordable as existing aluminum structural components (i.e., FORTE's bus structures).  If successful, this technology would show the feasibility to design and fabricate spacecraft electronic housings and heat sinks for PWB's that:  1.  Reduce their mass by 40-50% (compared to aluminum).  2.  Are thermally compatible with the future composite spacecraft bus and mounting decks and therefore can be incorporated into the structure itself (i.e., multi-functional structure).  3.  Are thermally compatible with each other (i.e., Cardcage and Heat Sinks).  4.  Are structurally and electromagnetically feasible.",

We willdevelop novel high permeability perfluoropolymers into hollow fiber thin film compostic (HF-TFC)membrane systems. These perfluoropolymers have excellent oxygen permeability, oxygen/nitrogenselectivity and thin film forming capability. Using techniques previously demonstrated on other glassypolymers, we will make HF-TFC with 20 times more flux than existing systems. Combining thesemodules with existing vacuum pumps and batteries, we can supply 5 liters/minute of OEA from an eightpound system. This OEA is humidified, which patients value. Phase I will demonstrate proof of HF-TFCconcept with 2 micron films. Phase II will focus on improving critical parameters and preparing a numberof expanded area modules with coating thicknesses of 0.1-0.5 microns for clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         As a leading company in computer aided design of microwave and high-speed electronics, Compact Software in collaboration with the Naval Research Laboratory's InP device development team, is interested in developing a much needed Physics-based simulation tool for Inp-based HEMTs and HBTS. We will develop and validate state-of-the-art HEMTs and HBTs models and combine them into our commercially available linear, nonlinear circuit simulator, microwave Harmonica(Tm). We have already developed physics-based models to predict linear and bias dependent performance of millimeter-wave AlGaAS/GaAs HEMTS. During the Phase I, we will extend our models to InAlAs/InGaAs/InP HEMTs and HBTs to accurately predict the device DC, linear and non-linear microwave performances including device output power and ldB compression point, third order intercept point, and essentially predict large- signal performance. The Phase II of the proposed program focuses on detailed experimental verification of the developed models and generation and integration of modeling tools to our circuit simulator, leading to full commercialization of Microwave HarmonicaTm. The successful outcome of this program will result in major strides being made in quality, usefulness and maturity of our CAD tools especially related to cost-effective realization of of InP-based devices and MMICS. Anticipated Benefits: The CAD enhancements resulting from this effort will be of immediate use to GaAs and InP MMIC device and circuit designers. Since no other CAD vendor offers such a tool, we anticipate product distribution in excess of 10,000 units world wide within the completion of Phase II program.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         CST proposes research and development of an artificial neural geometric engine designed according to a Lie group model of cortical visual information processing that can rapidly determine affine difference between two images. Computing parameters of geometric transform, such as scale, rotation, shear, shift, are considered as \"inverse problem\" in computer vision. The currently available warping and matching algorithm, which determine geometric distortion by trial and error, is very time consuming. The Lie group model of cortical visual information processing is a dynamical system. The neural geometric engine equipped with Lie germs is capable of computing Lie derivatives of imagery by linear filtering, and further determining affine differences of two images in a dynamical system. The full development of a Lie group model neural geometric engine will solve the geometric transform problem in realtime and will have very extensive applications in the area of imaging sensor data processing and will have great impact to artificial vision. Successful development of artificial neural geometric information processing system will make possible for quick terrain scene visualization from raw satellite and aerial photographs. The new technology can be applied to computer stereometry, image motion compensation and stabilization for automatic guided vehicles, and invariant pattern analysis for OCR.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         COMCO proposes to develop a new, meshless computational methodology for dynamic fracture simulation in fluid-structural interaction.  Our approach is based on a new class of methods which eliminate all need for computational mesh of finite elements.  This is accomplished by covering the computational domain by a cloud of points and using these points for discretiz- ation of the mathematical problem.  We will introduce h-andp-adaptivity, where new points will be adaptively added and removed in the domain, and the local order of approximation will be adaptively selected to assure high accuracy of approximation near the crack tip. This new approach will eliminate classical restrictions on modeling of crack propagation imposed by the finite element methods, where cracks can only propagate along element boundaries.  Moreover, by introducing adaptiv- ity, it will allow for accurate resolution of stress around the crack tip and tracking of crack propagation.  Importantly, the method will allow for a high degree of parallelization on MPP machines. In Phase I we will extend the meshless computational capabilities exist- ing at COMCO to hp-adaptive modeling of crack propagation problems in two- dimensional domains.  We will explore and compare various methods of meshless discretization, and select an approach optimal for fracture problems.  Also, we will develop a research-type code and allow for coupling with existing hydrodynamic software used for prediction of dynamic loading.  We will perform relevant numerical computations to demonstrate viability of the new technology.  The results of Phase I will be a basis for the Phase II effort, which will extend these capabilties to three-dimensional problems (including shells), full dynamic solutions, large-scale problems and various types of crack propagation criteria.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this project is to improve the GPS ionospheric correction algorithm.  The proposed improvements include extending the model to higher solar activity levels, improving the low latitude model, incorporating the UT (or longitude) dependence, and adding the capability of ingesting additional ionospheric data (e.g., a magnetic activity index, equatorial vertical drift) in near real time to improve the accuracy of the algorithm.  The revolution in microprocessor and microchip technology that has occurred since the present algorithm  was designed allows much more sophistication to be incorporated in an improved version.  For Phase I, we propose to produce a preliminary design of a algorithm based on the Global Theoretical Ionospheric Model (GTIM) developed at Phillips Laboratory (Geophysics Directorate).  It will be designed to fit in a single Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM) chip.  It will also be designed to be backward compatible with the present algorithm and to require little or no additional telemetry so that the impact on GPS operations will be minimal while providing the maximum benefit to the user.  We anticipate that the RMS error in the ionospheric range correction can be reduced from 50% for the present algorithm to 25% for the proposed improved algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The free-space characterization of an anechoic chamber is presently accomplished by conducting difficult and tedious RF measurements of the interference field intensity levels. Anechoic chambers are characterized after initial construction to determine the quiet zones where the creation of free-space conditions is being attempted. When systems under test (SUT) are placed in the chamber, degradation of the quiet zone occurs and generally characterization of the chamber must be re-accomplished. Chamber characterization with the SUT is usually the most time-consuming and a very costly part of the test activities in anechoic chamber facilities.  This Phase I proposal is to determine the feasibility of developing an accurate computer software model to simulate and predict the RF environment of anechoic chambers. The analytical tool will have capability which has application for characterization of any anechoic chambers containing any size SUT. The proposed solution takes advantage of an in-being Airborne Antenna Pattern Prediction Program (A2P3) desktop workstation to provide the required capability. With integration of other codes which provides accurate scattering models for the chamber anechoic surfaces, an enhanced A2P3 will provide an all digital model measurement tool to characterize the noise level, locate quiet zones, and hot spots in large anechoic chambers with or without SUT installed. This capability will greatly enhance anechoic chamber testing by accomplishing characterization with greater accuracy, automating characterization tests, and substantially reducing the overall characterization time and cost. The proposed approach allows the characterization tasks to be accomplished on a user-oriented workstation by test engineers without extensive knowledge of RF measurements techniques or the inter-working of the various codes utilized in the all digital characterization models. The resulting Test Mode Anechoic Chamber Characterization Analysis Tool will be an invaluable, cost-effective asset to support anechoic chamber testing activities.",

A standard environment will provide for greater player portability and reusability since players would not be linked to a unique and narrowly defined environment. Implementation of a standard multispectral environment will provide tremendous cost savings to any agency which engages in M&S; activity involving some type of environmental phenomenology.  The development of a standard multispectral environment must:  1) be performed from a \"big picture\" or integrated point of view; 2) be user configurable; 3) be scalable from lesser to more detailed granularity; 4) be distributable; and 5) contain a common geographic referencing system.  This common geographic referencing system should be capable of supporting the simulation configuration, execution and post-processing modes.  Several existing programs are centered around DoD standardization of various M&S; aspects, in particular digital terrain and surface feature databases.  This SBIR effort will not attempt to redevelop environmental effects models or databases but rather identify related efforts and draw upon them as resources for this study.",

There is great potential in using reliably measured OAE to provide a quick, inexpensive and non-intrusive assessment of hearing functional levels and detection of early temporal damage to the hearing function.  To further explore this potential, an advanced fuzzy logic filtering technique based OAE measurement approach will be investigated in this study.  Recent advances in fizzy logic have provided new filtering techniques that integrate inexact human experts and rigorous mathematical filters to handle noise and uncertainties.  Specifically, hierarchial fizzy logic and weighted majority minimum range based filtering techniques will be investigated and applied to obtain genuine OAE signals from the measured biological signals which are usually accompanied with noise and other artifacts.  Utilizing hierarchical fuzzy logic will add more flexibility both in integrating human experts with non-fuzzy filters and in using such non-fuzzy filters themselves.  This Phase I will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and Phase II will continue this effort to result in a fully functioned biomedical instrument to meet USAF needs in non-intrusive assessments of the hearing function.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Intestinal ischemia is difficult to diagnose and usually fatal. By the time signs of peritonitis,acidosis and shock appear, survival is rare. The mortality rate of bowel infarction remains at about 90%today despite improvements in surgical technique and supportive care. The key to reducing thismortality rate is early and accurate diagnosis, preferably by a simple non-invasive procedure that couldbe used in the emergency room. Recent animal studies have shown that the intestinal tract is highlysensitive to arterial blood supply. The changes in magnetic activity that result from ischemia happenwithin minutes and are quite large. Preliminary measurements have also been made to show thefeasibility of measuring the biomagnetic signal from human intestines. The signals are large and can beeasily measured using a high sensitivity superconducting magnetometer. We will develop the instrumentand measurement protocols necessary to turn this interesting phenomenon into a clinically usefultechnique. If successful, it will provide a rapid diagnosis of intestinal ischemia and other intestinaldisorders which strongly affect thenormal biomagnetic signals.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The structure of protein assemblies is largely determined by non-covalent interactions betweenproteins. The importance of shape complementarity of interacting molecular surfaces is generallyrecognized, but it is not easily studied, due to difficulties in quantifying shape. This proposal will developmethods for (1) characterizing the shape of protein surfaces, and (2) predicting complexes betweenproteins of known three-dimensional structure. The methods will be designed to work, even if thesurface amino acid side chains have indeterminate orientation, as is often the case in proteincrystallographic studies. Conformational flexibility will be modeled as partial occupancy (density) on athree-dimensional grid. The side chains' averaged density will be used for shape measurement. Areliable protein-docking computer program will be a quicker and less expensive means to study a proteinassociation than an x-ray crystallographic experimental study of the complex. Applications include: (1)predicting how a monoclonal antibody binds to its protein antigen, (2) the assembly of viral coat proteinmonomers into capsides, and (3) the genetic disease sickle cell anemia, where hemoglobin monomersassociate in an incorrect way. The software developed will be licensed to academic, governmental andindustry scientists researching the molecular basis of disease.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Laser polarimetric/ellipsometric methods have been employed in our laboratory for the measurement of the normal spectral emissivities of solid and liquid materials at elevated temperatures.  In this approach, a polarized light source is incident on the surface of interest at oblique incidence, and the reflected polarization state is measured in about 0.5 ms.  The optical properties of the surface, including athe normal spectral emissivity are then derived.  Recently, we have developed a laser polarimetric appartus using this approach and have achieved 1-3% accuracy in emissivity measurements on solid and liquid materials pulseheated over a 0.5 s time period.  These successful efforts form the basis of this proposal which seeks to extend the laser polarimetric approach to be capable of 1 MHz measurement bandwidth for application to very rapid pulse-heating experiments which last 50-100 us.  The Phase I work will be aimed at establishing:  (i) detector and electronics capable of 10 MHz bandwidth, (ii) design of the optics to accommodate specimen motion which occurs during the rapid pulse, (iii) methods to eliminate or minimize the incandescent background from interfering with the laser signal, (iv) methods to accurately measure the magnitude of the laser signal, and (v) testing of the proposed methods at the pulse-heating facility.  These key design problems will be investigated, both analytically and experimentally during the Phase I effort.  During Phase II, a prototype instrument will be constructed and delivered to NIST for experimentation on pulse-heated materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Control of trailing vortex wakes is an important challenge for both military and civilian applications. Ingestion of concentrated vortices in propellers can lead to undesirable noise in submarines, while the encounter of aircraft wakes with following aircraft presents a significant safety hazard that limits capacity at all major U.S. airports. This proposal involves an assessment of the feasibility of mitigating adverse vortex wake effects using aero- and hydrodynamic control surfaces actuated via smart structures technology. This will involve a combined computational/ design analysis effort focused on identifying changes in the spatial and temporal load distribution on lifting surfaces to promote vortex breakdown and other destructive instabilities that can deintensify the vortex wakes of aircraft and submarines. The computational analysis will apply proven tools in a study of the sensitivity of core structure and vortex wake hazard to modifications of the trailing vortex wake, while the design studies will build on modeling tools recently developed for the analysis of aerodynamic surfaces actuated using smart materials. The overall objective will be the identification of a technically feasible system using deflectable surfaces that can address current challenges in vortex wake deintensification through the promotion of altered wake structure. Anticipated Benefits: Vortex wake hazard drives aircraft landing separation at major airports and the delays resulting from excessive spacing cost the US economy several billion dollars annually in lost time and jet fuel. Even relatively modest reductions in current spacing would substantially increase effective airport capacity. In addition, wake alleviation for submarines would help protect the investment in the current fleet of low-noise underwater vehicles.",

It is not possible to achieve optimal performance in all flight conditions with rotor blades with a fixed twist distribution. The goal of this project is to conduct a design assessment of variable twist rotor systems that will allow in-flight adjustment of blade twist. Newly developed rotor design optimization software will be used to determine performance characteristics and optimum twist distributions for representative tilt rotor flight conditions and to quantify the required amount and distribution of the variable twist. Implementation of a variable twist capability will be explored using recent developments in advanced actuation technology, including shape memory design concepts involving variable twist more readily relaizable. The candidate rotor blade designs will be evaluated with input from experienced tilt rotor design personnel from industry to ensure that the final variable twist system can meet realistic performance, structural, and manufacturability criteria. The end result will be a variable twist rotor blade design well suited for detailed simulation and assessment in Phase II.",

Data retention over wide temperature extremes, without power is accomplished through use of ferroelectric RAMs, a nearly ideal storage device for this application.  Tasks include memory chip characterization of COTS parts, development of interface to sensors, architecture, fault tolerance. MCM packaging is key to meet lin3 volume.  A specific task will be to test and qualify selected memory chips for survival of 100 kg shock and data retention when mounted in candidate packaging means.  Also, under the proposed tasks, a preliminary design for a full-up DEM/VAL brassboard will be implemented.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSEL) offer unique optical and electrical characteristics including single mode operation, low power requirements, low beam divergence, circular beam shape and 2D configurability. As in any semiconductor laser these lasers lack temporal and spatial uniformity in wavelength for most present application. With the fast growing interest and development of applications utilizing VCSELs however it is becoming clear that there is a need for precise control of the laser wavelenth, either for \"agile\" wavelength tuning or fixed-wavelength applications. CoreTek, Inc. proposes a monolithic technology in which tuning is achieved through on-chip integration of an electro-optic layer coupled with a novel mirror design. Our integrated optic approach to tunable VCSELs allow electronic single-mode tuning up to 100nm throughout the wavelengths of GaAlAs/InGaAs (0.70-1.1um) and InGaAsP (1.0u-1.5um) lasers while yielding a narrow linewidth of >1A. As such, this method can be used not only to achieve \"agile\" wavelength tuning, but also for eliminating the wavelength drift problem by steady-state tuning. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept by developing an electro-optic thin film cavity and to demonstrate the electronic tuning. Phase II will be devoted to the development of optimal tunable VECSELs devices in terms of reliability, low cost fabrication and initial commercialization efforts. Tunable diode lasers will enable high bandwidth telecommunication industry, high density optical storage technologies, remote sensing for the military and environmental applications, toxic waste monitoring, mining applications. The present market for the proposed technology including applications is a multi-billion dollars world-wide.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Two years ago, Sony Corporation stunned the rechargeable battery industry with a commercial \"lithium-ion\" battery comprised of a carbonaceous anode and an expensive LiCoO2 cathode. While suitable for high end consumer electronics, LiCoO2 will not be economical for high capacity \"dual-use\" technologies, such as electric vehicles and load-leveling. Although other non-U.S. companies are developing similar LiNiO2 technology, nickel compounds are both costly and known carcinogens. Accordingly, inexpensive, non-toxic lithium manganese oxides (LiMn2Ox) will be perapred and tested as cathode materials in model rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. LiMn2O4 will be synthesized with transition metal dopants, thus stabilizing the crystal lattice, extending cathode cycle life, and increasing cell capacity. Both LiMn2O9 will be doped with Na to define the magnitude of the common alkali effect on cathode performance. Reaction procedures will be modified to increase efficiency, enhance product quality, and reduce costs. Cycling studies with the new, in-house Li methide-based electrolyte in both parallel plate laboratory test vehicles as well as coin cells will determine power output and short-term cyclability. Anticipated Benefits: This program will provide a low-cost, high-performance cathode material for compact 4V lithium-ion rechargeable batteries designed for use in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Most spacecraft require a memory to store data prior to the transmission of the data to an earth station.  Until recently, the majority of spacecraft data storage requirements were provided by tape recorders.  In 1989, however, a new era in spacecraft data storage began when SEAKR Engineering developed the first production Solid State Recorder (SSR).  The on-orbit success of this and subsequent SEAKR SSRs has enabled the industry to switch from failure-prone tape recorders to more reliable SSRs.  Earlier versions of these SSRs were designed as simple tape recorder replacements.  Advances in architecture pioneered by SEAKR have allowed the latest spacecraft SSRs to connect to multiple hosts, simultaneously perform random read and write operations, survive multiple hard and soft memory failures, and autonomously map out defective memory.  Future spacecraft instruments are being designed that will generate TeraBytes of information at Gbps data rates. The next generation SSRs must have much higher capacity and data rates based upon denser memory structures and a more flexible, multi-user architecture.  This program will develop this future SSR architecture technology with emphasis on increasing the data flow rate and decreasing the physical size of the memory support circuits.",

However, there are still problems associated with cost, distribution and safety in administration of the vaccines, e.g., needle-stick injuries.  Anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis is a world-wide problem affecting both animals and humans.  Although current anthrax vaccines for humans and animals have proven effective, recurring problems related to safety, cost, and drug delivery suggest the need for new approaches.  The goal of this proposal is to develop transgenic plants for the production of oral (food-based) delivery of a new recombinant vaccine based on isolated DNA sequences coding for the highly immunogenic B. Anthracis protective antigen (PA).  Specific objectives of Phase I are to 1) generate plant transformation/expression vectors encoding PA and a fusion protein of PA and CTB (the B subunit of cholera toxin which would facilitate PA transfer across o\the gut mucosa), 2) introduce the PA and PA:CTB antigen genes into tobacco via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and 3) affinity-purify PA protein from transgenic tobacco tissue and assess its immunogenicity.  Successful conclusion of Phase I objectives will provide a strong basis for scaled up recombinant vaccine production and testing planned for Phase II.",

The data structures will support representation of: DESIGN & DETAILING INTENT - formal representation of design features and dimensional/detailing relationships between them; FUNCTIONAL - feature, part, and assembly attributes and derived values; TOLERANCE - set based value representation on tolerance values; DEGREES OF FREEDOM - Kinematic, Finite element, Product configuration, and Assembly process degrees of freedom representation; DESIGN RATIONALE - Capture and representation of design rationale. In addition derived information that can be used in design optimization, engineering analysis, and product engineering will also be represented. The following data structures will be used to model the above mentioned information: 1) Frame data structure - to model qualitative/functional information 2) Free space data structures (configuration space, skeletons (MATs), vornoi diagrams) 3) Plans - for solving constraints and to support generic programming 9) Predicate logic based event history - for design rationale 5) Combinatorics graph - to suppport assembly process analysis 6) PDES/STEP SDAI API - to support standards based access to the above data structures. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The proposed project will result in a new generation modeling kernel that will result in expansion of the existing MCAD/CAE market. The kernel can be sold as add on the existing solid modeling products and kernels, and can be used to generate new generation applications in design for manufacturing design for assembly, and conceptual prototyping.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Recent technological advancements in the growth of bulk single crystal, ternary, III-V alloys strongly indicate the potential for commercial feasibility of these alloy substrates.  Commercial availability will permit realization of the concept of substrate engineering.  Based on reported developments in the (In,Ga)As and (In,Ga)Sb ternary systems, we propose to develop a materials technology for the single crystal growth of InP1-xAsx' to x = 0.4, commensurate with proposed optoelectronic device applications in this materials system.  The innovations are: 1) application of novel crystal growth techniques by which the alloy composition, \"x\" value, is increased by \"bootstrapping\" onto lattice matched seeds and 2) incorporation of ternary seeds with a growth technology to minimize computational variations which normally occur.  In Phase I, we will determine computational and electrical characteristics, develop a wafer fabrication methodology and evaluate crystal quality.  Wafers will be provided to Sensors Unlimited (Dr Gregory Olsen-Consultant) who will fabricate and test p/n junction photodetectors.  In Phase II we will extend the composition to x = 0.4 and develop techniques to grow crystals in the (100) direction of highly uniform composition.  Substrates for fabrication of 2.5um photodetector arrays and strained layer lasers will be provided Sensors Unlimited.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Intelligent materials open new avenues to improve performance, reliability and longevity of future aerospace vehicle structures by allowing the structural materials themselves to become active elements for multiple system functions. However, the application of intelligent materials and structures has been inhibited because the effects of microstructural interactions between intelligent and host material elements have not yet been well characterized. The objective of the proposed research is to develop predictive models of these local phenomena to enable analytical assessment of their effects on material and structural integrity. The research plan involves: (1) extension of existing micromechanical models of composite material behavior to include descriptions of intelligent material elements, (2) development of new models to assess the geometrically nonlinear effects of embedded elements in composite material systems, (3) application of numerical models of crack propagation behavior to predict growth of damage in intelligent composites, and (4) design of experiments to validate the analytical models and to further explore damage propagation in intelligent material systems. The analytical models developed under this effort will be implemented in widely used software systems (e.g. Mathermatics, NASTRAN).",

Advances in fiber optic and MMIC technologies have made fiber optic delay lines a viable alternative to the traditional methods of microwave signal delay for improved dynamic range, signal linearity, power consumption, physical package size, etc.  We are presently completing a fiber optic delay memory (FODM) for White Sands Test Range with roughly 43 watts power dissipation, 400 nsecs minimum switching speed for any delay change from 0 to 10 usecs in 50 nsec increments, dynamic range of 55 dB, and 1.5 GHz signal bandwidth. Extending and improving the technology of the present design will provide a system which satisfies all of the performance specifications of the SBIR announcement with uncertainty with regard to the dynamic range at 16 GHz bandwidth.  The objective of this Phase I proposal is to set up an experimental fiber optic link with various multiple delay mechanisms at 16 GHz bandwidth to determine the dynamic range of this link and project performance of a completed system for 655 usecs delay.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The traditional site characterization approaches, viz., soil borings and monitoring wells, are labor intensive and costly. Interest has grown rapidly over the past five years in the use of cone penetrometers and other minimally invasive methods to deploy or emplace sensors.  The focus of this SBIR proposal is integration of chemical and physical sensors with hydraulically driven probes that can be deployed from vehicles that are smaller and more mobile than cone penetrometers.  The Phase I work employs a phased evaluation scheme, culminating in conceptual design development of the most promising candidates.  The literature review will be subdivided in terms of the type of information the sensors may provide:  chemical, hydrological, and geophysical.  Among the sensor strategies that will be investigated are spectroscopic (principally fluorescence and Raman), electromagnetic, force, and chemical reagent types.  Preference will be given to sensor technologies that can be applied downhole and provide real-time data.  Limited but key experiments to test the durability of sapphire windows and fiber optics as a percussion probe is hammered to depth will be performed.  Accelerometers will provide measurement of the forces experienced by the probe during these tests.",

The proposed research addresses the following problems associated with sequence data:  the inability to associate consistent, quantitative error rate estimates with sequence data; the concomitant lack of quality control on the sequence data; and the inability to make informed decisions balancing cost per base of different methods (or laboratories) against the relative stringency of quality requirements imposed on different sequencing tasks.\r \r This work proposes to perform investigations to:  determine variables important to quality control of DNA sequencing; design optimal testing protocols and sampling plans for assessing precision and accuracy of DNA sequencing laboratories; and develop methods for determining variables which influence error rates, including sequence content, sequencing method, and experimental protocol.  The power of statistical tests will be studied using results for sequencing combinatorially designed, synthetic DNA fragments.  This investigation will be based on theoretical analysis, computer simulations, and on data provided through our collaboration with the Yeast Genome Center at Stanford University.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Fiberoptic links play an important role in future military and commercial systems. One of the most primary uses of digital fiberoptic links is for local area networks (LAN) where data signals as high rates as 1 Gbps are distributed in short to medium distance networks. Fundamental components of digital fiber optic distribution networks are data source, optical transmitter, optical fiber distribution, and optical receiver, clock recovery circuit and decision making circuit. With availability of high-speed optical sources and photodetectors, the focus is now in development of an integrated opto-electronic circuit which would be small in size and low power consuming. Standard clock recovery circuits based on the sample and hold, analog or digital phase lock loops require complicated and high power consuming circuits. The purpose of this proposal is introduction and demonstration of a new approach to design of optical receiver and clock recovery systems. Particularly, a technique based on the push-pull oscillator that is frequency and phase synchronized to the input data signal using injection locked phase lock loop scheme is advocated. Phase I of this work will focus on the analytical and simulation of an integrated optical receiver satisfying the required performance, where as Phase II will concentrate on fabrication, and testing of this product with emphasis on OEIC realization.",

This approach features a wavelet-based multiresolution approach to track estimation.  This multiresolution approach permits dynamic regulation of computational burden through control of both spatial and temporal resolution.  It includes an interacting multiple-mode approach for tracking maneuvering targets.  This tracking algorithm will be combined with a multiresolution version of a data association algorithm based on mean-field, event-averaged, maximum-likelihood estimation.  The mean-field theory approach to data association avoids the combinatoric costs of most permutation-based association algorithms such as MHT and JPDA.  This work also considers how these methods can be controlled by DFC's sensor manager.  The goal of the work is computationally tractable algorithms for air-to-air tracking of low-observable targets in clutter.",

Our underwater acoustic telemetry is based on a QPSK digital modulation technique and use of existing Probe Alert or UQC transducers. Ourt COTR at NSWC is listed in the related work section of this proposal. With this background we prepare to extend the acoustic communication capability to include Lprobability of Intercept (LPI). As part of our Phase I program we intend to investigate various spread spectrum techniques for achieving LPI, and to perform simulations of promising algorithms using MATLAB. Based on simulation results we propose to test the more promising algorithms using real data and an offline processing system. We proposed to work closely with Dr. Josko Catipovic at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who is a recognized authoirty in the area of digital acoustic telemetry systems.",

It is an immunosensor device to enable detection of BW agent specific antigens or extracellular products and toxins, using \"capture\" and \"detection\" antibodies, at picogram or sub-picogram levels, from biological fluids.  OpTest also is capable of detecting BW agent specific nucleic acids which are liquid hybridized with probes from biologic fluids.  OpTest embodies a multi-technology approach to the problem of streamlining and simplifying the currently rigorous requirements of personnel and environment for such testing, while at the same time improving the speed and accuracy of the results obtained.  Based upon advanced capabilities in thin film and surface immobilization science , and utilizing a sophisticated but simple optical detection strategy, the OpTest system uses the advantages inherent in a mass-change based approach to immunoaffinity binding reporting, to allow for a testing method that is extremely sensitive, rapid, and which can be produced easily and inexpensively.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The proposal describes a method for developing a dynamic simulation model of aircraft life cycle aging and obsolescence.  The model will assist USAF program managers in identifying and quantifying life extension options for aging aircraft.  The model can capture, in as much detail as described, each of the critical systems and components within an aircraft or system and track their aging and obsolescence over time.  For each system, the model will compute performance deterioration as well.  Periodic maintenance and refitting will reset model parameters to reflect increased performance levels.  USAF program managers will be able to test a variety of operational \"what-if?\" scenarios in order to discover the optimal choices that best meet mission requirements and, at the same time, satisfies both short-term and long-term budget constraints. Model output will provide cost and performance curves as well as the present value of cumulative costs for alternative acquisition and maintenance policies for aircraft systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Enemy forces can be crippled quickly at the beginning of a war by separating the enemies command and control structure from its combat forces and other elements of its defensive network. A false target generator has the potential to saturate or tie up an enemies air defense net and increase survivability of our own airborne assets. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an optimum candidate for a decoy payload in support of a Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) mission. The primary technical objective is to design an electronic decoy UAV payload capable of simulating multiple false targets that exhibit sufficient fidelity to deceive sophisticated radars. The phase I research and design effort will result in established perfomance requirements and a preliminary design of the electronic decoy payload. The design will be modeled to study its performance against a variety of threat emitters. Tradeoffs will be studied by means of qualified results from computer analysis and simulation. The design will be modified according to data obtained and lessons learned from the simulation. The final phase I design will be the basis for development of a brassboard demonstration model in phase II. The brassboard system will undergo extensive laboratory testing and mock-up testing. The phase II design will be modeled as in phase I, but will also be \"flown\" in dynamic engagement scenarios in the Lockheed Sanders Modeling Laboratory.",

The complexity of today's EW systems require non-intrusive instrumentation for their development.  This instrumentation must operate on a real-time basis so that the development/evaluation objectives can be achieved in a cost-effective manner in order to meet stringent real-time requirements.  This SBIR will develop a preliminary design and implementation approach for non-intrusive instrumentation for extracting Electronic Combat (EC) environmental effects on Electronic Warfare (EW) systems. Facilities such as IDAL can stimulate EW systems for laboratory testing but has limited capability for extracting resulting effects in a non-intrusive manner.  The IDAL is an excellent example of a facility that requires real-time non-intrusive instrumentation because they must work with state-of-the-art integrated avionics which share resources and data.  The shared resources and data is the key enabling technology for future systems.  Trouble shooting these systems is another key requirement that must be performed on a real-time non-intrusive basis.  The key technical challenge is non-intrusive testing. Conventional methods of real-time instrumentation for complex EW systems that utilize shared resources and data often corrupt the data recorded and effect the systems operation providing bad test results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Phase I technical objective is to design a series of small receiving antennas which operate in the HF, VHF, and UHF frequency ranges (approximately 1 MHz to 1500 MHz) and then to build and test prototypes of the designs. The antennas are physically small in size and man-packable. Conventional antenna design approaches have constraints which can result in physically large structures, especially in the HF frequency band. Tradeoffs between size and electrical performance are required to develope small antennas. Analysis of the most prevalent RF environment in the frequency bands of interest will be necessary to allow optimizing the antenna size and performance tradeoff, and in general to minimize the amount of hardware required to provide acceptable performance. Delfin Systems has extensive experience in the design and simulation of small, portable antennas, as well as communications system analysis and design. Many Delfin Systems products use optimized, small, lightweight antennas. The designs requiring external power sources have been optimized for extremely low power consumption. Delfin Systems is unique in that it has developed significant expertise in the smooth transition from computer modeling of antenna designs to successful implementation in hardware. The antennas developed in the work are universal, and are capable of working with all common existing equipment. Interfaces to equipment are therefore to be as universal as possible, and modification of existing equipment is not required. The antennas physical configuration can be used in a wide variety of mounting scenarios with minimum installation time and effort. The proposed antennas offer the best tradeoff between physical constraints and desirable electrical properties, and their use or inclusion in existing systems or operational scenarios, requires a minimum of effort and retraining of the user. These small antennas offer appreciable advantages over existing antenna schemes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In order to develop and test a combat system, it is often required to operate a subset of the system without some of the interfacing components. It is therefore necessary to simulate the operation of these missing components and to stimulate the existing interfaces with realistic and repeatable sensor and control data. This interface simulation is also necessary for training of operators, where tactical situations must be simulated in order to provide realistic training scenarios. The objective of this proposed Phase I effort is twofold. First, the requirements for combat system simulation/stimulation will be identified and a simulation/stimulation architecture that meets these requirements will be defined. This architecture will take maximum advantage of the Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), Open System Architecture (OSA) components that are planned for the implementation of new combat systems and will be implemented by migration of existing simulation software, where possible. Secondly, a prototype subset of a combat system will be proposed for use as a test facility to verify the capabilities of the architecture. An optional task is proposed, which will result in a Phase 11 plan that covers specific configurations and test requirements.",

In addition, we will investigate different approaches for integrating high speed optical resonant detectors and MMIC amplifiers on the same InP substrate. The objective of this investigation is to determine the optimum selective epitaxy and selective etching schemes for integrating InP-based detectors and HEMT MMIC amplifiers. Our overall goal is to develop a technology for manufacturing integrated photoreceivers with frequency response up to 44 GHz. Dr. Leye Aina of the Microwave Signal, Inc. will consult.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A solution to the problem of interchip interconnects is proposed that employs electro-optical links implemented monolithically on silicon substrates.  This approach addresses the fundamental material incompatibility problem of opto-electronics by implementing electronics in silicon and optical components using III-V compounds on a single chip.  This is made possible through the use of \"selective epitaxy\", a technique that Discovery Semi- conductors has developed to grow device grade InGaAs-on-silicon substrates.  Growth of InGaAs crystals on a lattice mismatched substrate is improved by limiting the growth area, selecting appropriately oriented wafers, and controlling the growth conditions.  Dr. Eugene Fitzgerald of M.I.T., who pioneered selective epitaxy, will consult.  This capability will be used to grow dual function, infrared In0.53Ga0.47As p-i-n photodiode/light emitting diode structures operating at 1100 to 1600 nm on a silicon CMOS circuit.  These devices can be used to form optical links between separate seminconductor chips.  A simple, proximity focussed architecture is presented where multiple silicon chips are stacked together.  The optical emitter/detector pairs then form the links between the layers of the stack.  A device that has all the components required to implement this scheme is proposed for the Phase I work.  A more elaborate multi-plane, optically coupled, massively parallel processor is anticipated for development in Phase II.",

These are bulky, less reliable,and less accurate than electronic components, and they generate unwanted vibrations. Their sizeinterferes with placing analyzers as close to the patient as desired. Advanced designs for compact andreliable spectroscopic gas analyzers are dependent on the development of a chopper technology whichis compact and reliable. The electro-optic chopper consists of a ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) cell anda pair of specially designed IR polarizers. It will be compact, precise, reliable, and vibration free. Thepolarity of applied voltage controls whether the shutter is open or closed.The investigators haveexperimentally demonstrated the essential principles of the device. However, tn order to fully evaluatefeasibility they must determine the achievable optical efficiency, reliability, and cost.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Increased tip chord, tip speed, and use of sweep have long been recognized as beneficial to fan and compressor aero designs. However, significant increases in blade stress, blade weight, disk weight, and cost result from higher tip speed and longer tip chord. An innovative design concept is presented that reduces blade stress, weight, and cost while increasing possible forward sweep and blade natural frequency.  This concept uses a self supporting 360 degrees rotating shroud ring with an interference shrink fit between the shroud ring and the blade tip.  The radial deflection of the ring and blade tip are nearly matched and the ring provides a positive clamp force at all steady-state and transient operating conditions.  MMC and OMC materials are used in shroud ring design for 400 degrees F to 500 degrees F applications at corrected tip speed (UT/0) up to 1650 ft/sec.  An analytical feasibility study of the Interference Shrink Fit Shroud (Tip Ring) concept is proposed for the Forward Swept JTDE subscale fan with MMC and OMC ring materials.  A tip shroud ring is added to the existing Finite Element Model and the feasibility of each shroud ring will be determined, as well as, ring weight, blade weight, blade frequencies and live disk weight.  A comparison will be made to the baseline enshrouded rotor.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Cement-bonded particleboard is an environmentally safe high-performance reconstituted wood product with desirable longevity, fire resistance and life-cycle cost position, presenting a great potential to maintain the competitive position of reconstituted wood boards in demanding construction markets.  The low productivity of cement-bonded particleboard plants and the inhibitory effects of some wood species resulting from the slow setting and hardening of cement have led to relatively high initial costs.  Early exposure of cement binders to carbon dioxide can substantially reduce the setting and hardening times.  Industrial-scale implementation of the carbonation technology, however, has been hindered by the difficulties in achieving uniform carbonation effects and controlling the rate of carbonation reactions, and also by the high cost and unavailability of CO2 in large volumes.  In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose to replace pure CO2 with a blend of CO2 and air, and eventually with CO2-enriched exhaust gases which are readily available at low cost and are responsible for the greenhouse effect.  We have hypothesized that the air content of the exhaust gas opens channels into the board for thorough penetration of CO2, and also helps control the rate of reactions to make industrial-scale implementations more practical.  Phase I research will determine the CO2 concentration and vacuum/gassing regime best suiting the production of particleboard.  We will also evaluate various exhaust gases for introduction into the process, and will assess the commercial viability of the new approach to carbonation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Modeling of dynamic performance of rolling bearings as a function of thermal interactions resulting from applied operating conditions and internal frictional dissipations is proposed.  The overall development consists of a thermal interaction model to predict temperature distributions under both liquid and solid lubricated conditions, coupling of the thermal model with the contact mechanics models, and finally incorporation of these local interaction models in a bering dynamics computer code.  In the proposed Phase I effort technical feasibility of the modeling approach shall be proven by development of a thermal model to compute contact temperatures in ball, cylindrical and tapered roller bearings, implementation of the model into existing bering dynamics computer codes, and by carrying out parametric studies to demonstrate a relationship between contact temperatures and applied operating conditions with prescribed bearing geometry.  A more extensive development, where changes in bulk temperatures, resulting thermal distortion and changes in bearing geometry, closer integration of the thermal and contact mechanics models, modeling of thermally induced instabilities in bearing element motion, and integrated computer codes for bearing design and performance diagnosis, shall be the subjects of technical development in Phase II.  It is anticipated that the enhanced bearing dynamics computer codes will provide immediate technology transfer for bearing design and performance diagnosis.  In fact, even the contact temperature models proposed in Phase I offer stand-alone practical potential for design and failure diagnosis, since the Phase I work scope includes the implementation of these models in bearing dynamics computer codes.",

In military operations, the variabilities are further magnified by the mobility of the network nodes and the highly unpredictable, often bursty, nature of the traffic.  The proposed protocols will consist of a hierarchial topology establishment/maintenance protocol and an adaptive routing control protocol.  The topology protocol accommodates the slowly changing network propagation conditions, and the routing protocol accommodates the bursty, highly variable traffic from the network subscribers, as well as the effects of sudden propagation disturbances.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The widespread occurrence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the environment requires a comprehensive assessment of their environmental impact. This assessment is made substantially more difficult because the PCBs are a mixture of 209 possible chloro-isomers; the most common mixtures may not represent the most significant toxic or biologically active components. Consequently, there is growing recognition that the congener specific analysis of PCBs in the environment is required for the evaluation of the PCBs environmental impact. However, the effort and expense associated with the analysis of these compounds by capillary gas chromatography place substantial restraints on the required studies. Immunoassay based analytical methods have demonstrated the ability to provide both high throughput screening and quantitative analyses. This method provides for a marked reduction in both sample preparation due to high specificity and instrumentation requirements due to assay simplicity. This project will build on ECOCHEM's successful development of a sensitive and quantitative Aroclor directed PCB immunoassay to develop a toxic/ biologically active congener relevant assay for both sample screening and congener specific analysis.",

Monitoring will be required todetermine the extent of the environmental impact and offers an opportunity toempirically minimize it.  Here EEI proposes the development of an ultra sensitivecontinuous monitor for mercury and other trance elements (e.g., Pb, AS, CD,etc.).  The monitor is based upon plasma emission spectroscopy using aninnovative microwave-driven plasma source.  The plasma source is capable ofobtaining electron energies  2 eV which will result in a minimum detection limitfor mercury  0.1 ppb  1  g/M3. This is an order of magnitude more sensitivethan presently available technologies, and is anticipated to meet monitoringrequirements.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Paints are used extensively for the corrosion protection of aircraft.  A paint system typically comprises of an underlying primer and a topcoat with the primer containing pigments that act as corrosion inhibitors.  The most successful inhibitors in aircraft paints are the chromates (e.g., zinc yellow or strontium chromate).  Since chromate corrosion inhibitors represent a significant environmental and health liability, more environmentally benign inhibitors are required. We propose a new class of corrosion inhibitors based on reduction-oxidation (redox) active, electrically conductive oxides.  When galvanically coupled to a metal, they will maintain the mixed potential of the couple within the passive range of the metal preventing active corrosion. Unlike conventional chromate inhibitors, these metal oxides autocatalytically reduce 02 or H2O allowing them to sustain anodic protection without themselves discharging to active potentials or being consumed in the films (probably <20 nm thick) directly on metal surfaces or on carrier pigments, e.g. TiO2, SiO2, or Al flake, by a solution process is also proposed.  The process should allow inexpensive production of large quantities of coated pigment material.  The Phase I objective is to demonstrate the mechanism of corrosion inhibition using galvanic coupling studies, chronopotentiometry, and other electrochemical characterization techniques.  The oxides will be applied on metal substrates such as Al alloy 2024, stainless steel (316), and Ti as well as on selected carrier pigments.  The role of H2O, oxygen, and pH on the inhibition mechanism will be studied.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A new quasi-resonant converter, called the unipolar series resonant converter (\"USRC\"), will be adapted as a four-quadrant drive for electric vehicles (\"EVs\"). With zero current and voltage switching, it will high modulation frequency (over 30 khz), thus driving a motor silently and efficiently throughout the speed range. The USRC produces any waveform required by any type of EV motor. It produces clean sinusoidal voltages, thus liminating induction motor overrating, noise and losses due to harmonics. The USRC can also receive any type of power, such as DC from batteries and AC from an engine generator, without any hardware change or need for other conversion or interface hardware. Finally, due to the use of high frequency modulation and the elimination of external filters, the USRC drive will be smaller and less costly than alternatives. Due to the USRC's extraordinary conversion flexibility, it can also become the heart of the entire electrical system of the EV. Without other conversion or interface hardware, it can link together the prime source (engine generator), storage (batteries or flywheels), propulsion motor and auxiliary loads (lights, wipers), in spite of highly disparate types of power. For example, a battery charger would not be necessary. Anticipated Benefits: In addition to the benefits described above, the resulting designs and technologies can be used by industry and the government in the following applications: variable-speed drives and actuators, variable-speed generation systems, inverters for photovoltaic cells, fuel cells and batteries, frequency changers, uninterruptible power supplies and power conditioners.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The advanced warheads required for the next generation of munitions will require the use of advanced initiators such as exploding foil initiators (EFIs), and they will require that these EFIs be employed in innovative and, by our present standards, complex arrangements.  Certain advanced munitions will require that these warheads and their initiators survive high-g impact and target penetration events without degradation of function.  All will, of course, have to survive and operate in the full spectrum of the military storage and operating environment.  Meeting these challenges will require the development of a new packaging and interconnection technique which provides maximum flexibility to the warhead design while still meeting the military environments and the tough functional challenges of the advanced initiator application.  The results of these efforts will provide a higher efficiency energy transfer allowing the use of lower power and/or smaller size systems for commercial and military use in other products.  A key element of these future system is the design of appropriate connectors.  The proposed program is for the development of an ultralow impedance high voltage connector.   The program focuses on EFIs, both the conventional copper-clad polyimide systems and the more advanced, thin-film, deposited-bridge \"chip\" types.  It includes the definition of requirements, tradeoff analyses, and breadboard evaluation of a preliminary design.  In addition to the electrical performance, the design requirements include sufficient ruggedness to survive hard target penetration and hermiticity for long term storage survival of the system.",

Proposed fiber optic chemical sensor technology relies upon the reversible chemical bleaching of selected immobilized triphenylmethane dyes.  Hydrazine related vapors (UDMH, MMH and H) will react with the central carbon of triphenylmethane dyes reversibly forming Lewis acid-base abducts.  Formation of these abducts will result in chemical bleaching of initially intensely colored dyes to give, upon complete saturation, colorless intermediates.  Subsequent removal of hydrazine related species will shift the equilibrium back to the free triphenylmethane dye coated optical fibers will induce an optical change in both the dye and at the dye-optical fiber interface.  This will give a detectable perturbation at the evanescent wave being transmitted through the optical fiber.",

(ECD) HAS DEVELOPED A HIGH PERFORMANCE, THIN FILM GLASS-LIKE COATING (CLEAR COAT (TM)) AND DEPOSITION PROCESS THAT CAN IMPROVE THE BARRIER PROPERTIES OF COMMODITY POLYMER FILMS BY A FACTOR OF 100. THE COATING IS TRANSPARENT, COLORLESS, NONTOXIC, LOW COST AND DOES NOT EFFECT THE RECYCLABILITY OF THE POLYMER FILM. PILOT-SCALE PRODUCTION OF HIGH PERFORMANCE FILMS WITH EXCELLENT BARRIER PROPERTIES HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED. WE PROPOSE TO UTILIZE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP A NEW TRANSPARENT, HIGH BARRIER FOOD PACKAGING TECHNOLGY, ADDRESSING THE SUBTOPIC PROCESSING PACKAGE DESIGN IN FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION. CURRENT HIGH BARRIER FOOD PACKAGING MATERIALS UTILIZE ALUMINUM METALLIZED FILMS OR FOILS OR SPECIALIZED POLYMER FILMS SUCH AS POLYVINYLIDENE CHLORIDE (PVDC) TO LIMIT PERMEATION OF OXYGEN AND WATER VAPOR. LACK OF TRANSPARENCY OF METALLIZED FILMS AND FOILS AND LOW BARRIER PROPERTIES AT HIGH TEMPERATURE OF PVDC FILMS ARE UNDESIRABLE. IN ADDITION, THESE PACKAGING SYSTEMS ARE DIFFICULT TO RECYLCE AND THEIR MANUFACTURE AND DISPOSAL CAN BE ENVIRONMENTALLY HARMFUL. IN PHASE I OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WE WILL CHARACTERIZE THE BARRIER PROPERTIES OF THE PACKAGING FILM AFTER SUBJECTING IT TO THE MECHANICAL AND THERMAL STRESSES ENCOUNTERED IN MANUFACTURE AND USE OF FOOD PACKAGING, OPTIMIZE THE MATERIAL PROPERTIES BY ADJUSTING THE DEPOSITION CHEMISTRY TO MEET THE IDENTIFIED REQUIREMENTS, AND DELIVER SAMPLES.",

The fiber diameter, length, packing fraction and surface treatment are adjusted for maximum bond effectiveness corresponding to a given grain distribution and binder composition. Proposed electrostatic fiber placement and resertion methods are suited for large scale use. The proposed bondline reinforcement concept potentially results in a simpler motor assembly process, as well as lighter and more reliable propellant castings. Phase I effort involves initial coupon peel testing from which promising configurations will be selected for evaluation using the blister test method with 12\" specimens. Candidate fiber attachment and insertion methods will be evaluated. ESLI carbon fiber electroflocking and fiber implantation will be tailored for use with rocket insulation materials. Test results will be interpreted in terms of a preliminary model that accounts for fiber type. Fiber distribution and interfacial adhesion properties. Phase 2 would further develop processes conducive to cost-effective assembly of high-reliability solid rocket motors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Thermal storage devices based on phase-change materials (PCMs) have traditionally been box-like structures with robust walls and PCM volume fractions <60%.  The usefulness of such devices in aerospace thermal control applications is limited because of the bulkiness and weight.  A far more useful configuration would be thin (1-5 mm) PCM plates that can be readily integrated into electronic racks, focal planes, panels for radar and photovoltaic arrays, and in laser-hardened radiators.  LEO satellites abound with thermal transients driven by periodic environmental and traffic loads, and lightweight thermal inertia in a thin PCM plate format would be generally useful.  Prior PCM art does not teach how to achieve both PCM containment and structural stability in thin plate structures.  This project will use innovative design and non-woven fiber assembly methods to fabricate thin PCM composite plates that have high PCM fraction for heat capacity, integral small-gauge heat pipes for high thermal conductivity, and good mechanical strength and stability.  In Phase I, plates will be fabricated and characterized both thermally and mechanically.  Application to spacecraft thermal control, avionics and pulse power electronics will be pursued and the potential benefits quantified.  Phase II would develop thermal control components based on thin-plate design and scale-up production capability.",

A novel transducer element, based on a miniature, laterally acting linear motor driving a skin contactor is proposed.  The transducer includes a mechanical impedance matching device which enables efficient energy transmission to the skin surface in spite of significant damping imposed by surrounding tissues.  Multiple transducer elements will be combined in a thin, lightweight conformable array to form the tactile interface.  The array will be driven directly by standard 5 volt TTL integrated circuits, and is well suited to battery operation.  A prototype array of six waterproof, pressure equalized transducers will be fabricated, and testing will be conducted on subjects both in air and underwater.",

In Phase I, we will begin to model the behavior of these explosives based on a new physical model of the fundamental reaction processes and on the most current scientific understanding of the physical behavior of the solid and fluid components of explosives during and subsequent to the reaction processes.  Model development will be completed in Phase II, incorporated into a hydrodynamics code, and validated against the known behavior of three explosives, each in a different class; one ideal, one nonideal, and one in a separate class which we define as totally nonideal.  In the latter class, fuel and oxidizer are separated, being in different grains of the composite explosive.  Once this task is completed, behavioral predictions will be made for cases not reported in the experimental data base.  In this way the predictive code can be verified as truly predictive by subsequent experiments.  In Phase I all the physical data, and much of the analysis necessary for the construction and implementation of the code will be detailed.  In this Phase, three explosives will be selected and everything necessary for their modeling in the hydrocode will be presented.  In Phase II, three practical applications to military and industrial problems will be made. Here existing explosives will be tailored in their composition to maximize desirable explosive effects.  In addition, it will be possible to predict the behavior of entirely new explosive compositions, thus providing a rationale for the development of promising explosive types.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this program is to investigate the feasibility of a novel method of fabricating printed circuit boards based on Metallo-Organic Decomposition technology. This technology was first investigated for applying metallization to solar cells by ink jet printed, For circuit board applications heavier traces are required to obtain adequate conductivity, and the present program proposes to achieve this by enhancing the printed image by powder coating additional MOD compound. The program will investigate materials for powder coating, provision of a printed image which will adhere the power, powder de-composition and production of printed circuit samples. A successful Phase I and Phase II program will provide prototype processing equipment and materials which will permit direct printing and enhancement of circuit boards without photolithography, etching or plating. Circuit boards will be produced directly from CAD files without generation of wastes of any kind. Anticipated Benefits: The technology to be investigated will provide the capability to produce custom boards or short runs and minimize inventory costs for private sector producers. For defense systems it offers an approach to direct write conformal applications such as aircraft antennas.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Phase I SBIR effort involves the feasibility testing of a biological treatment system called a biotrickling filter to treat odorous and noxious air emissions of significance to the Navy.  Sources of odors on Naval ships include holding tanks for sewage, garbage, and oily bilge.     Sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on ships include holding tanks for hazardous cleaning and de-greasing solvents. Sources of VOCs on shore include paint spray booths and coating operations. Biotrickling   filters are similar      to   conventional   scrubbers,   but   rely    on microorganisms growing on the surface of the scrubber packing material to remove and degrade contaminants as a vapor stream passes through the system. The objectives are to:     (1) screen microbial cultures for the ability to grow on hydrogen sulfide, methyl   mercaptan, butyric acid, and propionic acid; (2) discuss on-shore VOC applications with Navy personnel and screen microbial cultures for the ability to grow on four representative VOC contaminants; (3) develop an on-line gas chromatographic method for continuous monitoring of the targets; (4) show that the target compounds can be effectively degraded within bench-scale biotrickling filters using the microbial cultures developed during objectives 1 and 2; and (5) write a final report outlining the results of the Phase I effort.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Essential Research, Inc. proposes to build a thermophotovoltaic (TPV) electric generator using a solar concentrator heat source with thermal storage capability, a selective emitter, and a photovoltaic cell. The operation point of the heat source and selective emitter will be approximately 1700K. The moderate operating temperature was chosen to provide a system energy conversion efficiency of greater than 20% and the high reliability required for military operations. The heat source is a solar concentrator dish developed by McDonnell Douglas Aerospace. The selective emitter will be a single or polycrystalline host material (such as garnet) doped with rare-earth oxides. A narrow band gap photovoltaic cell will be fabricated by the organo-metallic vapor phase epitaxy (OMVPE) deposition of InGaAs on InP substrates. The bandgap of the photovoltaic cell will be tailored to optimize the conversion of the selective emitter spectra, even though this will result in a lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate. The defects generated by the mismatch will be passivated with hydrogen to optimize the electrical properties of the photovoltaic cell. We believe that this technology will provide excellent conversion efficiencies in a commercially viable process. At the end of Phase I, we will demonstrate this technology by developing an emitter/cell combination (a converter) having a 15% conversion efficiency. In Phase II, a prototype TPV generator to deliver between 500-1000 W of electricity will be deployed. A final system efficiency of greater than 20% is anticipated. A solar TPV system can be a cost effective, compact, highly efficient, totally radiation hard replacement for any electric generator used in space or on earth where continuous or intermittent sunlight is available. Solar TPV will be a zero emission, high power system which uses a renewable energy source. It will be very reliable and quite, and it contains a battery-less maintenance free long life energy storage system. The system can be easily scaled to provide power levels suitable for many commercial or military uses.",

Within such networks, the fiber optic bypass switch must operate with high reliability and fault tolerance to maintain a low-loss optical link with the network or, if necessary, to bypass inactive network teminmals or nodes. Reliable fault tolerant bypass switches are commercially available for many private sector terrestrial applications, but to not meet the Navy's requirements for environmental stability, cost, size and power consumption.  For this proposed research program, Fiber and Sensor Technologies, Inc.  (F&S;) has assembled a research team consisting of FiberCom, Inc., the Fiber & Electro-Optics Research Center (FEORC) at Virginia Tech, and AVX, Inc. to research, develop, manufacture, and market a compact, low-cost, micropowered bypass switch for remote, battery-powered sensor arrays.  In the proposed Phase I program, F&S; researchers will apply their expertise in the research, development, and manufacture of fiber optic devices and components to reduce the current size, power consumption, and cost of FiberCom's magnetic bypass switch, as well as develop new and innovative switching techniques using piezoceramic and shape memory alloy microactuators.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Fiber and Sensor Technologies, Inc. proposes to develop a fiber optic sensor that can be embedded in a polymeric matrix composite to monitor the state of the composite \"from cradle to grave\". During fabrication, the sensor will output quantitative data which will indicate the degree of polymerization of the matrix resin. In service, the same sensor will monitor internal strains of the composite part.  Continuous  monitoring of the sensor output can be used to detect strains that may preface failure of the component.  Two technical approaches will be experimentally compared, to select the most promising for Phase II commercialization.  In the first, a modified extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometric (EFPI) fiber optic strain sensor will be configured to measure directly the viscosity of the matrix, from which the cure state may be derived.  By coating the sensor with an actuator (such as a magnetostrictive material), the embedded sensor can be made to vibrate under appropriate excitation.  The optical sensor will measure the mechanical response of the sensor, which will depend on the viscolastic properties of the  matrix.  In the second approach, an embedded EFPI sensor will be used to correlate changes in the refractive index of the epoxy with cure state.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The demand for improvement in the perf ormance and ef f iciency of modern turbines requires the development of advanced materials which retain high strength, creep and oxidation resistance at increasingly elevated temperatures.  Many materials meet the high-temperature criteria, for example ceramics, some intermetallic compounds and metallo-ceramics such as MoSi2, but suffer from a lack of toughness, either because of persistent brittleness at high temperatures or because a ductile-brittle transition (DBT) takes place between operating and room temperatures.  Critical to the utility of these materials is an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the DBT and specific indication of how the impact of the DBT can be minimized or avoided.  This proposal will focus directly on MOS'21 an MC material which, at high temperatures, combines the strength typical of ceramics with the toughness of metals.  The proposed work will use an innovative, inter-disciplinary technique (combining fundamental quantum mechanics with materials science) to evaluate the temperature dependence of dislocation nucleation and mobility and hence determine the origin of the DBT in MOS'2.  From this a prescription will be developed for increasing the fracture toughness of MOS'2 by microalloying to eliminate or control the DBT.",

It is possible to marry together the software component model with the object database model, allowing the construction of massive, distributed systems whose objects possess self-knowledge, facilitating users searching for information.  Such a software component database would allow users to explore/browse functionality of components and use required components to build new software components.

These pulsars can have risetimes as fast as 150 ps, peak powers as high as 100 GW, and repetition rates as fast as 1 kHz. Examples such as the \"H2\" and \"H3\" pulsars developed by Phillips Laboratory have already been built and tested, and a new design that should reach 100 GW, called \"HASP,\" is currently being built. A difficulty remains with this technology, however, because no suitable antenna exists to radiate such fast risetimes at these high power levels.  The purpose of this project is to develop suitable antennas for this class of sources.  This class of pulsars could carry out critical new missions in a variety of military and commercial applications.  Of particular interest, is the possibility of using these sources as part of a transient radar system to locate mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO).  The promise of these many applications remains unrealized, because they generate large power levels in an \"unbalanced\" form that is difficult to radiate.  However, a new technology, called the \"Half IRA\" (where IRA stands for Impulse Radiating Antenna) promises to radiate these sources with little loss, while still preserving the risetime.  The goal of this project will be to develop an antenna that can take advantage of this class of sources.",

Hybrid methods incorporating best wavelet packet features combined with wavelet zero tree coding have the flexibility needed for both texture and structure compression. These can be easily incorporated under the same tree based signal processing structure and are of low computational complexity promising realtime applications. Moreover the same structure enabling compression will permit image denoising before compression as well as the ability to transmit partial signals and lower resoltuion as required. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: We expect in Phase I to demonstrate the feasibility of a real time platform for storage and transmission of high resolution scanned imagaes.

        "abstract": "Abstract         ARPA has identified an important need for improved noise abatement while providing increased fuel economy for automobiles and other motor driven vehicles. This proposal is responsive to this need. It provides for a Phase I project to design and prove the feasibility of a noise abatement device for use on automobiles instead of conventional resonators and mufflers. This concept uses active noise abatement techniques. Prior art has limited these techniques to known and regular noise generation such as sixty cycle hum in commercial power generation systems. The innovation opportunity here is to extend, or rather develop new technology which will enable this approach to work on irregular noise such as that generated by the exhaust from automobiles. The proposed approach utilizes digital techniques to construct an equal and opposite sound wave to effectively cancel the noise source. Other innovative components include the sensor for sensing the noise and the transducer for countering the noise. Anticipated Benefits: There are many automobiles. Each one is a potential customer for this improved technique which will reduce noise and improve fuel economy, thus saving fel and reducing the consumption of fuel in motor vehicles. It is anticipated that there will be a broad market for this product both within and out of government.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Currently optical fibers are drawn from preforms that require complicated processing steps and repeated batch-type handling. This increases the cost of the ultimate fiber because preform cost often represents more than 50% of the fiber cost.  Additionally, since the preform rod has a specific volume, the length of the fiber that can be drawn is limited.  This increases the number of optical couplers and amplifiers needed to achieve a very long signal path from the relatively short segments drawn.  This also adds potential variability in optical performance and an increased probability of mechanically weak points in the fiber system.  Both these aspects further increase the system cost.  These problems can be reduced by developing a novel process in which glass precursor coatings are formed on a continuously moving filamentary core of material which is removed or becomes a part of the ultimately formed optical fiber.  Optimizing the process to yield strong, low loss optical fibers of ultra long length should significantly lower the cost of optical fiber systems for various military and commercial applications for communications.  The sol-gel process also should provide the opportunity to develop specialty fibers/sensors for environmental and other applications with improved reliability and reduced cost.  The proposed Phase I study involves a thorough investigation of state-of-the-art processing for applying sol-gel glass coatings to host core filaments and vitrifying the coatings into high quality optical fibers, comparable in mechanical and optical properties with fibers obtained by the current preform method.  These results will be used as the starting point for the further development and optimization studies in Phase II to arrive at a reliable process to yield ultra long length optical fibers with uniform, high quality optical and mechanical properties.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A number of techniques currently exist for computing rotorcraft aerodynamic flow fields.  These range from very fast lifting line schemes which only include the simplest incompressible, inviscid modules for rotor-blades and wake, to full CFD compressible, inviscid potential free-wake methods which are moderately fast, through full compressible Euler/Navier-Stokes methods for rotors and bodies, which are very expensive and have only been used to date for parts of the rotorcraft problem.  Currently, there techniques are only used in widely different studies, typically by different engineers, due to the widely different computational speeds and performances of the schemes.  A systematic approach is described to combine these techniques into a \"multi-level system\".  The basic idea is that each method will be implemented in a code module which will use essentially the same input and output and appear to a user as almost the same code. Then, the user can easily and quickly do computations for the same problem with different modules, with varying levels of accuracy and speed.  This will be very important for rotorcraft engineering design and analysis where a large number of cases (several hundred) must be computed for parametric and optimization studies. Currently, oly very simple, fast codes are used for these studies which lack important aerodynamic effects.  With the proposed multi-level system, an engineer will be able to still do a large number of fast runs, typically on a workstation.  However, after every set of fast runs, a single, higher fidelity run will be made.  The difference in the results between the simple and higher fidelity runs will be used to modify the subsequent set of simple, fast runs so that they include the effects that the simple code, by itself, would have neglected, without greatly increasing the computational time.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating a smart material containing layers of piezoelectric transducers bonded to shape memory alloy layers. The critical problem in fabricating these smart materials is to produce a ceramic-metal bond that can endure the high stress-strain state cycles to which it will be subjected in use. This bonding cannot be accomplished using conventional techniques that heat the entire assembly. In this project a pulsed electron beam (PEB) bonding system will be fabricated and tested. PEB irradiation has the capability of depositing the electron energy preferentially near the bond interface, producing a temperature profile than can fuse the dissimilar materials together with the potential to leave the bulk properties of the piezoelectric and shape memory alloy intact. In this Phase I project lead lanthanum zirconium titanate (PLZT) piezoelectrics and Ni-Ti shape memory alloys will be subjected to PEB irradiation and their properties evaluated before and after irradiation. The PEB parameters (e.g., electron energy, beam pulse length and repetition rate) will be set based upon Monte Carlo computer simulations that predict temperature profiles leading to bonding. Piezoelectric elements will be bonded to shape memory alloy foils in Phase II using the beam parameters determined in this Phase I project and the properties of the bonded materials evaluated. Anticipated Benefits: Vibration cancellation systems based upon the proposed smart materials could be applied to machine tools or the tool-machine interface to enable precision machining (e.g., 0.1 mil tolerance) without the use of expensive or large cutting machines or tool holders. The impact on the aerospace, automotive and other industries of low cost precision machining could be in the billions of dollars per year in cost reduction and improved productivity.",

We will apply our experience in polymer fiber and film processing, surface-metallization and innovative material development to provide the Navy with a complete evaluation of key technical issues. Biodegradable chaff design concepts such as melt- processed 100 percent biodegradable polymer fibers, shape memory polymer fibers, hollow fibers, polymer films and controlled solubility, biodegradable glasses will be evaluated during the Phase I program. In Phase I, we will deliver to the Navy 2 lb of biodegradable chaff in the form of 1 mil thick fibers cut to 1 in. lengths. In Phase II, we will refine the process, scale-up to larger quantities and sub^Lt procurement specifications required for the Phase III procurement solicitation.

It has recently been demonstrated that helicopter rotor vibration comprises a periodic \"component\" and a chaotic \"component.\" The periodic part can be eliminated using Higher Harmonic Control (HHC), leaving the chaotic component. Until recently, it was considered unfeasible to further reduce the vibrations. A new method, called the OGY technique, has been discovered which permits many chaotic systems to be controlled. In the proposed program, the OGY technique will be extended and combined with HHC to essentially eliminate rotor-generated vibrations in helicopters. In Phase I, acutal helicopter vibrations data will be analyzed to prove that the chaotic vibrations are controllable. This program will be performed with the participation of the Boeing Helicopter Company, who will provide proprietary vibration data. Phase II will include a demonstration of combined HHC and chaotic control in actual helicopter testing, wind tunnel testing, or through numerical simulation.",

The proposed tunable sting subsystem allows the shooter to preselect the effect on the target.  At low settings the net will perform only as an ensnarement weapon which will delay flight and make physical resistance more difficult.  In the case where there is a high risk associated with an armed adversary the shooter can maximize the setting which will make any form of resistance impossible.  The proposed system takes maximum advantage of existing and ongoing research by complimenting net and deployment designs by FMI and several fuzing an delivery weapons designs by other companies. The proposed program effort will concentrate on incorporating existing medical information on shock levels into the system design, reviewing snare net data to determine the best wiring pattern in conjunction with the medical advice and confirming circuit designs which must account for potential short-circuits, and survivability of the sting subsystem the physical shock of deployment and capture.",

Research has been conducted to develop through thickness reinforcement technologies to offset these limitations. Foster-Miller's Z-Fiber process has demonstrated 30 fold increases in fracture toughness with little degradation to in-plane properties. This baseline Z-Fiber process has promise to limit airfoil structure FOD Damage and as a joining method for co-cured stiffened skin structures.  Boeing and FM IRADs and Wright Lab initiated JTCG seed funding has demonstrated feasibility of an advance version of Z-Fiber technology entitled Ultrasonically Assisted Z-Fiber (UAZ).  In this process ultrasonic technology replaces autoclave heat and pressure requirements.  The UAZ process makes additional applications for Z-Fiber feasible along with reinforcement of cured thermoset and thermoplastic structures.  Successful development of this technology offers cost reduction, repair options, joining of cured structures, and application to thermoplastics and complex contours.  Boeing and FM plan to support UAZ with CY95 IRAD.  Additional SBIR funding would maximize the potential to bring this technology to the shop floor.  In Phase I FM and Boeing would investigate technology potential, mechanical performance, system concepts and application areas.  The program would conclude with demonstration component fabrication.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Liquid wastes generated during the cleaning of air craft (wash rack waters) and fire training exercises using aqueous film-forming foams are becoming more difficult to dispose because of increasingly restrictive environmental regulations. Ideally, wastewater components such as surfactants, detergents, and oils should be removed from these waste streams prior to discharge to a waste water treatment facility because of their large chemical oxygen demands.  Foster-Miller proposes to combine a newly emerging Engineered Response gel technology with specialized process equipment to produce a regenerative, cost effective and portable system for treating these wastewaters in a regulatory compliant manner.  The key innovation involves a new class of polymeric gels that can be tailored to adsorb surface active agents and chemically-stabilized oil emulsions at loadings which could approach 50 times their weight of the gel.  The Phase I program focuses on the synthesis and characterization of the polymeric gels in synthetic wastewaters with respect to both adsorption and regeneration and the design and cost estimate of a prototype field demonstration unit.  The Phase II program would involve demonstration of the unit at an AF facility.",

Using  several Sea Dog units a simple random pattern has been shown to provide  a high degree of coverage over tactically useful areas.  Using  near-field sensing elements, instrumentation can be kept inexpensive  permitting sensor integration.  A simple decision matrix described  herein can distinguish all common threat obstacles and mines.  An  interchangeable payload can be used to neutralize the threat using  either bulk or flying plate technology, or a navigation and  communication system can be used to covertly report the location  (within 1 ft) of discovered obstacles.

Existing state-of-the-art materials and processing methods will be integrated by innovative methods to provide a superior and cost effective helmet armor system.  The helmet will consist of a single or multiple part hard outer shell, most likely of ceramic or similar material, and a tough composite inner shell.  Phase I will define and demonstrate this helmet armor through initial ballistic tests of flat samples.  The project team consists of experts in the areas of ceramics, polymers, composite materials, and armor.  The new helmet and its armor system technology will not only be applicable to ground troops, but also to other military personnel and law enforcement agencies which use tactical armor.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Technical planners are required to prioritize the development of new systems technologies relative to user needs.  Designs for these new systems typically only exist at the conceptual or preliminary design level, yet trade studies must be performed to assess cost and effectiveness, as well as overall affordability.  Bottoms up estimating techniques cannot be used without performing a complete detail design, a time consuming and expensive process.  Estimation by analogy only works when the new system or concept is similar, both technologically and functionally, with an existing system, a requirement that is often not met.  Planners require a methodology and toolset which enables concept cost estimation when only operational or functional performance requirements are available.  Objectives of this SBIR are to refine a methodology for estimating avionics life cycle cost based on system level performance requirements.  The Phase I program will demonstrate feasibility of the proposed approach and provide a limited functionality prototype of a PC based software tool which implements aspects of the methodology.  The initial effort will develop cost estimating relationships, and demonstrate utility for the Air Force TMD Attack Operations effort.  The Phase II program will fully develop the cost estimating software tool.  The tool would have wide application throughout the Armed Services, with the potential for commercial applications by any developer of advanced technology products, both civil and industrial.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Agriculture and forestry are the primary economic engines of northern Idaho.  Both industries are struggling.  Agricultural revenues have been stagnant for almost 5 years, agricultural support and service industries have virtually disappeared from rural communities, and farmers have recently lost a major share of regional markets for barley and oats to Canadian products which benefit from transportation subsides.  Planned reductions in local timber production are expected to result in job losses as high as 50% over the next five years.  Forage-based agriculture offers excellent potential as an alternative enterprise to address both the economic and ecological challenges facing the area.  Several areas in the northwest have revitalized their economies by diversifying to forage products.  The area is well suited for the production of perennial grass hays and the recent development of prototype mechanized bale harvesting equipment compatible with the steep, highly erodible terrain in northern Idaho offers the foundation technology to support a rural development program to transition or diversify from cereal based cropping.  Recently over 2000 tons of local forage products, much of which was harvested by this prototype equipment, was sold for export.  The proposed research will make a comprehensive evaluation of the agronomic, equipment, economic, marketing and sociological issues associated with the feasibility of forage based agriculture as an alternative enterprise for rural development in northern Idaho.",

Gene medicines utilizetissue-specific DNA expression vectors and novel vector delivery systems for the in vivo delivery oftherapeutic proteins. Clinically effective and safe gene medicines will require the development of reliablemethods to regulate gene expression such that synthesis of the therapeutic protein is not only restrictedto the proper cell-type and tissue but is also at a level that remains within the therapeutic rangeappropriate for the disease being treated. Our previous work at our laboratories and in the founder'slaboratories has led to the development of a muscle-specific vector system (MVS) capable of directingthe synthesis of proteins in muscle in vivo. The control of gene expression in eukaryotic cells iscomplex, involving the interaction of a variety of tissue-specific positive and negative trans-acting proteinfactors with specific regulatory sequences associated with tissue-regulated genes. MVS vectorsincorporate upstream and downstream regulatory sequences derived from the well-characterized chickenskeletal alpha-actin gene to control the expression, mRNA stability and translation of clinically relevantproteins. The purpose of this research is to develop synthetic muscle-specific vectors which will providehigher levels of expression in mammalian muscle cells than natural promoter elements. We will constructa series of synthetic promoter/enhancer fragments based on the sequences of transcriptional controlelements involved in the activation and regulation of genes in mammalian muscle cells.",

The \"gene switch\" is based on a derived mutant of the progesterone receptor thatis activated by progesterone antagonists, but is not activated by progesterone agonists or other steroids.This mutant will be recombined with DNA binding sequences that recognize a unique element not foundin human cells. The gene encoding the gene switch under the control of a constitutive promoter will beintroduced into cells with the therapeutic gene and will be regulated specifically and selectively byanti-progestins at low levels that will exert no anti-progesterone effect. The vector will be validatedusing a tyrosine hydroxylase gene controlled by the gene switch. Cells containing these genes will beused to treat an animal model of Parkinson's disease. This will serve as a model for vectors that maybe used to treat complex, neurodegenerative diseases where tight control of gene expression will beimportant.",

This system will play a major role in guidingcolonoscopes through the colon to the cecum. It will increase the efficiency of colonoscopy, save time,and possibly decrease morbidity due to the procedure by reducing excess looping in the colon, asignificant factor in colonic perforation.

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose to develop an energetic payload fired from the Navy's standard five-inch gun which is capable of defeating modern antiship missiles at distances greater than five kilometers. The defeat mechanism is based on exploitation of highly exothermic condensed phase reactions producing three ingredients which play key role in missile-defeat. These include: the generation of non-oxidizing metal vapor, an intense fireball consisting of reactive/hot particulates and reactive hot pellets of higher penetration capability. The defeat mechanism results from one or a combination of several effects such as blinding IR and RF sensors by intense fireball and on the metal coating, as well as mechanical damage to the missile structure by the hot refractory fragments with high penetration capability.",

SPACEBOARD IS A NOVEL STRUCTURAL BOARD COMPOSED OF PULPED WOOD FIBER. THE SPACEBOARD CONCEPT WAS INVENTED AT THE FOREST PRODUCTS LABORATORY SEVERAL YEARS AGO. THE BOARDS ARE PRODUCED BY PRESSING FIBER AGAINST COMPRESSIBLE RUBBER MOLDS TO FORM A STRUCTURE HAVING A SMOOTH FACE, BACKED BY AN INTEGRAL PATTERN OF HOLLOW CELLS. TWO SYMMETRICAL HALVES ARE BONDED TOGETHER CELL-TO-CELL TO FORM A COMPLETE BOARD. THE STRUCTURE HAS A VERY HIGH STRENGTH TO WEIGHT RATIO, CAN BE TAILORED TO A VARIETY OF SHAPES AND SIZES, AND CAN BE MANUFACTURED FROM SCRAP WOOD, UNDER-UTILIZED TREES, AND RECYCLED FIBERS. THE THICK FORM OF SPACEBOARD, KNOWN AS SPACEBOARD II, DRIES VERY SLOWLY USING CONVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES. THE SLOW DRYING OF SPACEBOARD II HAS BEEN AN IMPEDIMENT TO COMMERCIALIZATION. OUR PROPOSED DEVICE WILL REMOVE THIS IMPEDIMENT BY INCREASING THE DRYING RATE SUBSTANTIALLY. A SMALL8SCALE APPARATUS WILL BE FABRICATED AND TESTED DURING THE PHASE I PROGRAM AND A FULL-SCALE PROTOTYPE WILL BE BUILT DURING THE PHASE II PROGRAM.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         With the advent of inexpensive CMOS electronics, it has become possible to design and construct high-performance VHF/UHF radar systems at relatively low costs.  Remarkable advances have been made in the areas of solid-state amplifiers, digital sampling and processing hardware, as well as in computer hardware and software used to analyze and visualize physical results.  In the proposed approach, commercially available components and sub-systems are utilized at they cross the high-cost threshold into the decidedly less costly mass markets.  When clever design principles are applied and effective data acquisition algorithms are employed, one routinely achieves performance exceeding that of more costly systems built only a few years ago.  Thus, the revolution in low-cost components triggers similar changes in the radar diagnostics available within the budgetary constraints of the Federal Government and the commercial market place.  The proposed effort consists of a design study along with the associated development of a prototype system.  Particular attention is paid to VHF systems near 140 MHz, where current technology is immature and prospects for securing frequency assignments for operations are good.  A radar diagnostic in this portion of the VHF band is extremely effective for a variety of studies involving natural atmospheric and ionospheric processes, investigations of artificial perturbations of the atmosphere, identification of hard-target signatures and turbulent wakes of interest to the USAF, and commercial probing of the earth's sub-surface.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         An improvement to a power metallurgy near-net-shape consolidation process, Radially Constricted Consolidation (RCC) process, is proposed. Program objective is to develop complex shaped ceramic containers (shells) for soft die hot pressing of powders using the RCC process. Shells to be developed are intended for consolidation of copper alloys, iron, iron base alloys, and stainless steels. Taguchi methods will be used to design and execute the experimental study. Experiments will involve design factors such as shell chemistry, time and temperature of drying, particle size, etc. If successful, the results will allow commercialization of the RCC process for small and medium sized P/M parts. Phase II work will scale-up the shell size, provide scientific understanding of successful shell compositions, and produce prototype parts, and test them. The RCC process has the potential of becoming a major P/M process which can expand markets served by the P/M industry into larger and more complex shaped parts. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed research and development effort will allow the potential of the RCC process to be realized. Manufacture of small and medium sized complex shaped parts, up to now impossible to manufacutre by any other P/M process, will be possible. Many castings and welded assemblies, including those used in aero-space applications, may be replaced by RCC products with better properties and lower cost.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The short pulse length of ultra wide bandwidth (UWB) radar systems allows them to penetrate dense media such as foliage, thereby permitting battlefield surveillance of artillery and infantry. Due to their short pulse width, the UWB radars are susceptible to interference from FM and AM radio, and television stations. These narrowband interfering signals have to be suppressed to effectively operate the UWB radar system. Adaptive interference suppression techniques based on separating the eigenspaces spanned by the interference signals, and the clutter and target echoes, are proposed. Because the interference is narrowband compared to the echoes, the dimension of the vector space spanned by the interference signals is much smaller than the clutter echoes. The proposed technique suppresses interference by projecting the received data (clutter and target echoes plus interference signals) onto the orthogonal complement of the vector space spanned by the interference. The eigen-space spanned by the interference is estimated using the measured data. Computational efficiency is improved by using a proprietary algorithm that calculates the interference eigenvalues and eigenvectors more rapidly than concentional eigendecomposition routines. A computer architecture for implementing the interference suppression technique will also be developed.",

This is expected to require control of the freezing rate inlyophilization and use of proprietary microporous film technology. At present, reagents are introducedin tissue sections by static diffusion. The vertical flow of fluid through \"microchannelled\" tissue bymeans of pulsed filtration is expected to improve the efficiency of cell analyses. This should reduceassay costs, improve accuracy, and streamline automation. In phase I, the focus will be to maximizeassay efficiency, based on perfusion, for immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. The idea is todevelop the necessary devices to facilitate the transition to a perfusional assay format. This would serveboth the manual system that uses microscope slides and a proposed automated system that uses\"Tissue Discs\".",

Existing formal-methods tools are hobbled by (1) weak user-interfaces, and (2) severely limited capabilities for integration with other tools.  GrammaTech seeks to remedy these problems by developing a professional-quality, standards-compliant, customizable, portable, common interface tailored to formal-methods applications. By effectively combining its commercial editor/ interface-generation technology, the Synthesizer Generator, and the emerging commercial technologies for component software, OLE and OpenDoc, GrammaTech aims to build a generic formal methods interface (FMI) that facilitates widespread adoption of formal methods in industry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The demands for greater operating efficiencies in turbine engine has prompted the search for high strength materials for critical rotating components.  As a result, the Aerospace industry has invested considerable effort on the development of light weight, Metal Matrix Composite (MMC) materials as an alternative to nickel base super alloys and directionally solidified materials.  In spite of numerous government and industry programs to cost reduce MMC materials, they remain expensive... driven by the high cost of raw materials and labor intensive manufacturing and inspection processing.  Extending the useful life cycle of MMC materials would allow its high initial acquisition cost to be spread out over a much longer life cycle and make MMC materials more cost competitive.  The specific objective of Grey Fox Technologies; Phase I effort is to explore the feasibility of developing a simple, low cost method to restore the fatigue strength in titanium MMC composite materials.  The overall program objectives are to develop, demonstrate, and commercialize methods that will allow the \"safe reuse\" of MMC components in the Aerospace Industry.  Grey Fox Technologies' proposed rejuvenation cycle offers a low cost method for repairing MMC materials.  IF the method is successful, all aspects of the repair procedure can be performed in typical aircraft engine service facilities and commercial heat treating and plating shops, providing a broad, competitive supplier base to the aerospace industry.  Grey Fox Technologies' will evaluate the effectiveness of its unique rejuvenation process during the proposed Phase I.",

The proposed research will investigate new integrated photonics technologies and hybrid manufacturing processes to the miniaturization of parallel multichannel optical receivers and range counter circuits.  The goal is to design a modular, high-speed, parallel multichannel optical receiver which has complete receiving and range circuitry for each pixel in a 25 by 25 element (minimum) array.  The Phase I research will result in a design for a prototype 2-D APD imaging sensor to be developed in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The SBIR Phase I proof of concept research applies affordable info-geometric instrumentation networks to the large water range application. The proposed SBIR Phase I proof of concept research will:  1) Formulate a large water range communication/instrumentation technical specification,  2) Develop a Phase I test plan to demonstrate key specification capabilities,  3) Breadboard a proof of concept testbed,  4) Conduct key proof of concept demonstrations,  5) Submit a Phase I final technical report and Phase II prototype system demonstration plan.  Info-geometric devices possess the ability to mutually communicate with (info) and track (geometric) each other. Groups of info-geometric devices cooperatively form self organizing data fusion networks. Any info-geometric devices passing near an info-geometric fusion network (i) may be accurately tracked in location and orientation by the network, (ii) may communicate instrumentation data to the network, and (iii) may receive command guidance data from the network. The large water instrumented test range consists of info-geometric beacon units (IBU's) deployed at sea (unsurveyed, drifting). HTI has demonstrated IBU mutual communication rates of 64 kilobits per second and mutual range resolution of 5-to-10 centimeters in earlier ARPA and NCCOSC research programs, that exceed the performance requirements of the proposed research. Any test platform possessing a low cost info-geometric transponder will be automatically tracked by the large water range. Its tracked location and communicated instrumentation data will be reported to one or more info-geometric base station units for monitoring and scoring. The large water range will be capable of simultaneously tracking at least one hundred info-geometric transponders. The info-geometric instrumentation may take alternative forms to address specific tracking requirements. \"Remodulation tags\" are low cost transponders that can be tracked by the large water range at moderate distances with high precision...(this is the subject of a separate SBIR Phase I proof of concept proposal for aircraft interaction testing). Low cost transmit-only devices can be tracked at greater distances than re",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The neurotoxins of Clostridium botulinum are the most lethal proteins known.  The bacterium is ubiquitous, and thus rapid, reliable, sensitive, and cost-effective assays are needed to detect the toxin.  Current immunoassays provide a rapid means to detect the neurotoxin.  Their sensitivity, however, is limited by the affinity of the detecting antibody.  The objective of this research, therefore, is to develop high-affinity anti-botulinal antibody through recombinant DNA technology.  During Phase I, we will take a two pronged approach to generate recombinant botulinal antibodies.  First, we will construct a phage-display heavy and light chain variable gene combinatorial library from a botulinal toxin A hyperimmunized animal. Bacteriophage displaying the neurotoxin reactive antibody fragments will be affinity selected and clonally isolated for subsequent analysis.  As the combinatorial library may not represent in vivo occurring heavy-light chain combinations or all anti-toxin A immunoglobulin classes, we will in the second approach produce monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) by traditional hybridoma techniques, following which the encoding cDNAs will be cloned.  In future work, the cDNAs from the isolated antibody fragment-displaying phage and from selected Mabs will be engineered for higher affinity recombinant antibodies, providing an invariant, stable, and inexpensive immunoassay reagent.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The overall objective is to determine the relation of changes in the physical dimensions of the face to measurable subjective judgments of acceptable appearance. Perception of tolerance for deviations from \"normal\" will be quantitated using psychophysical methods. A user-friendly computer program will be developed to present a series of digitally-modified images of gradations of changes in physical dimensions of the soft-tissue profile (STP) as continuous rather than discrete changes, much like a flower blossoming in continuous slow motion. Specifically, the anterior-posterior (A-P) positions of the upper (UL), lower lips (LL), chin and vertical dimension will change continuously from extreme positions of unacceptability. Without an intermediate operator, the respondent indicates acceptability by pressing a computer-interfaced button until the feature is no longer acceptable. The measurement of perceived deviation from \"normal\"-appearing faces is critical to understanding the bases of social behavior toward persons who differ from accepted but unspecified standards of physical appearance. Ultimately, a data base of ranges of tolerance for physical deviation of individual features will be provided for use by clinicians now relying on intuition or anthropometric norms. This will be particularly useful for persons with craniofacial deformities as well as for women tyrannized by media-promulgated \"standards\" of youth, thinness and attractiveness.",

A high specific energy of 180 WH/lb at 5 KW constant power and 10 KW peak power is projected. The design objective is to obtain high electrical efficiency at cell level, facilitating safe thermal management of the battery in Phase II. Three progressively evolving cell designs, with two cells of each design, will be built and tested to demonstrate this high power capability and 220 WH/lb is expected from the third iteration. Probabilitiy of success is high based on the maturity of the HEDB technology. The failure modes of this battery system will be identified, using the data from critical component tests, and the battery design features and system controls, which mitigate these concerns, will be formulated. A test program will be written with the objective to demonstrate, by Phase II implementation, that all safety questions are resolved.",

Chemical compositions will be determined by an acid digestion procedure followed by ICP and LC analytical procedures.  After the characterization tests are completed, samples from constructed wetlands will be \"processes\" by heat treatment, screening, and floatation methods to determine how pigment and ion-exchange characteristics might be improved.  The results of these measurements and experiments will allow an assessment of the value of \"raw\" and minimally \"processed\" iron oxide precipitates from constructed wetlands.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The most-time-consuming and labor-intensive process in any product development is the iteration between design and validation thru physical model building and testing.  With ever increasing complexity of modern weapons systems and current political environment, the need to reduce development time and cost has never been greater.  Amongst a myriad of techniques that have been introduced, Rapid Prototyping has brought the most significant improvements.  Rapid Prototyping (RP) is a new class of model fabrication process that creates a 3-dimensional object directly from a solid CAD file by electronically sectioning the object and physically reconstructing each cross section one layer at a time with minimal human intervention.  The technique allows fabrication of models at previously unsurpassed speeds.  Despite its success and steady progress over the past 5 years, the state of current RP technology does not allow direct fabrication of fully functional models for more extensive testing.  In light of the aforementioned limitations and potential benefits, Helisys proposes a 6 month R&D; program aimed at applying innovations in materials, software, and laser optics to the already successful commercial process called Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Currently an effective diver mine imaging sensor for use in VSW mine reconnaissance does not exist. The SBIR topic requests a capability to locate and image mine targets within a 45 deg wide x 10 deg high field-of-view and to image targets with a resolution of at least 3\" at a range of 20 yards. An acoustic lens sonar is a preferred technical approach. Both an acoustic lens sonar and a more compact, lower cost diver imaging system will be investigated. This alternative imaging system employs a low resolution, mine detection sonar coupled with a very high resolution lidar to image and identify targets at ranges out to 20 yards. Phase I will consists of: (1) mine detection and imaging system trade studies, (2) design of a high resolution imaging sensor system, and (3) the conduct of a series of critical component demonstrations of breadboard subsystem components in order to reduce the risk of prototyping an imaging system during Phase II. The detection sonar proposed for this system has detected a -20 dB sonar target at a range of 88 yards, on a sand bottom in 20 feet of seawater. Lidar imaging performance is predicted at 5 attenuation lengths in 4 meter attenuation length water.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Shrimp farming is the world's most valuable aquaculture sector with 1994 production of 733,000 MT and crop value of $4 billion.  This huge industry depends on wild animals with its seedstock either gathered directly from the sea or produced in hatcheries from wild-caught broodstock.  Recently the industry has experienced severe disease problems which in part are due to its reliance on wild animals known to carry a variety of pathogens.  Massive epizootics in several major shrimp producing areas have caused 80% crop failures.  Based on the highly successful development of Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) Penaeus vannamei broodstock for the U.S. shrimp industry, this project will develop a stock of SPF P. monodon.  Comprising over 60% of world production, the black tiger shrimp, P. monodon, is the most important (in volume and value) farm-raised shrimp worldwide.  The same procedures used for developing SPF P. vannamei (ICES guidelines) will be followed in this project.  Technical objectives of the project include:  to locate and import sources of SPF-candidate P. monodon postlarvae; to screen for pathogens and rear \"clean\" candidate groups in quarantine to reproduction size; to reproduce and screen offspring of candidate groups to certify their SPF status.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The modeling and active control of the resonant interaction between a free shear layer and an open cavity is of direct relevance to military aircraft applications.  Techniques will be investigated to first model and then control acoustic resonance in open cavity flows.  The problem consists of the nonlinear interaction between a turbulent free shear layer and the cavity acoustics and is further complicated by the reattachment geometry and the acoustic receptivity of the separating shear layer.  This problem focuses on first developing an accurate yet computationally inexpensive physical model and then actively minimizing the cavity acoustic levels by modifying the shear-layer characteristics with actuators controlled by a neural network.  This approach is innovative in both the development of a previously nonexistent dynamic model and application of actuators and neural network-based controllers to the flow-induced weapons bay acoustic problem.  The effort, while specifically targeting a weapons bay, is also generally aimed to any flow separation problem exhibiting intersection between a free shear layer and an open cavity.",

Phase I of this effor involves the content and design specifications for simulations which are cirtical to trauma management including:  establishment of a surgical airway, placement of an endotracheal tube, chest tube placement for treatment of tension pneumothorax and diagnostic paracentesis, venous access (femoral, sublavian, and jugular), and reduction of extremity fractures and dislocation.  In addition, HT will complete a prototype module for subclavian line placement (central line) procedure.  Phase II will involve the development of functionally-complete prototype device which allows simulation of each of the above mentioned procedures and the integration of the virtual reality procedural simulations into patient case scenarios to allow practice and assessment of these skills for medical personnel. Phase II involves the development of a medical training simulation for distribution and actual use for both civilian and military usage.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         For monitoring trajectory and attitude of small missiles and projectiles, the positioning signal accessible from the GPS satellites may be used effectively anywhere on earth. While low-cost compact receivers using \"GPS engines\" are available, their use on-board highly maneuverable missiles is limited by the up-date rate, processing power, and the local oscillator stability over the operating environmental conditions. To overcome these limitations, Hittite proposes a transponder-based approach which uses high capacity data processing capability located on a remote platform or on the ground. This proposal describes Hittite's approach to implement the GPS translator system for missile tracking. Trade-off studies of system architecture, transponder, processor and communication links will be performed. Both single transponder/INS and multiple transponder architectures will be investigated. Design approaches of the transponder portion of the translator, based on the effective utilization of MMIC technology, for aplications on missile platforms will be investigated. The optimum system configuration will emerge as a combination of on-board miniaturized transponder(s) and remotely located digital signal processor. The proposed program is based on Hittite's experience in the GPS Registration Fuze program, for which Hittite developed a set of MMIC chips for a double-conversion frequency translator.",

HNC has implemented this algorithm in the laboratory using HNC's Vision Processor (ViP) chip set was developed by HNC and ARPA to perform high speed image and neural network processing. The ViP consists of two VLSI gate arrays that can perform fundamental processing operations such as large kernel convolution, subtraction of two images, multiplication of two images and look-up table transformation of an image. A daughterboard with the ViP is built and is available from HNC as a commercial product. HNC proposes to extend our preliminary work with NRL algorithm, analyze its restrictions and precision requirements, investigate improvements, compare its performance to other possible algorithms, and since we have existing hardware that can perform non-uniformity correction in close to real-time, demonstrate and test that hardware using MWIR or LWIR imagery.",

Two heads are proposed ---- a slow one for recording and a fast one for readout. Designs of the heads are simple. The heads are mounted on rails and are driven by linear actuators. The fast head has no moving parts on it and is very light-weighted. The technique used to store data is very tolerant to translational misalignment. Because of this valuable property, tracking electronics are built with standard inexpensive components. When built, the read/write module will sustain a recording rate in excess of 10 Megabits/second, a readout rate of 240 Megabits/second, and a random access time of approximately 20 milliseconds. The storage density of the disk is approximately 122 bits per square micron. The anticipated benefit of the proposed research is to support a data storage system with high capacity and fast access time of the data. Applications that may benefit from this project include and systems that require large data bases.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A low-cost, manufacturing technology is proposed to polish, defect-free, crystallographically perfect surfaces on all economically important semiconductor and optical materials. The technology is applicable to the high-volume production of a broad range of military and commercial components requiring surface accuracies between 0.3 and 0.006 microns. The feasibility to combine precision optical polishing techniques with fast, defect-free, chemical-mechanical polishing methods will be demonstrated. An innovative, wear-resistant and stable, fluorocarbon lap is used to replicate its precision surface onto the workpiece using a silica hydrosol slurry. To address the immediate requirements of the microelectronics industry, HTG will first demonstrate the ability to polish silicon wafers, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates, and to planarize interlevel dielectrics to a precision not possible using resilient polymeric laps. The methods are equally applicable to superpolishing precision glass and metal optical components. In addition to enhancing lithographic resolution, process latitude, and yield for IC's with 0.35 - 0.25 micron features on bulk silicon, HTG's methods can used to fabricate larger, lower-cost, SOI substrates for commercial CMOS-SOI logic and SRAM chips. Anticipated Benefits: Production of DRAM's, SRAM's, Flash EPROMS, and HDTV related memory chips; high-speed SMOS/SOI chips. Superpolished optics for projection x-ray lithography, synchrontron, and high-energy lasers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         SIMOX (Separation by Implanted Oxygen) technology achieves total dielectric isolation of active device regions from the substrate and reduces the collection path for ionized charges via the built-in buried oxide which restricts charge movement. Advances in SIMOX technology include radiation hardened memories and gate arrays for space applications, ULSI DRAMs for low voltage operation, thin film SOI BiCMOS for low power circuitry, and extreme (400 oC) temperature applications of SIMOX circuitry. A thin (100 nm) buried oxide (BOX) SIMOX product is under development in order to significantly reduce the cost of the cost of the substrates for both military and commercial applications. recent device survivability studies have indicated that conventional hardening processes applied to SIMOX are not feasible unless the buried oxide density is near to that of thermal oxide. For the thin BOX experimental process, the hardening mechanisms will not work due to the 9% difference in BOX density as measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry. This Phase I proposal examines the feasibility of an innovative density reduction process for developing a hardened thin BOX SIMOX product. Buried oxide material quality and radiation hardness will be assessed via electrolytic tests and BOXCAP device performance. Commercialization of a radiation hardened thin BOX SIMOX product will be aggressively pursued. The nation may expect to benefit from the development of a low cost, radiation hardened semiconductor substrate process. Systems and components fabricated on hardened SIMOX will assist both military and commercial applications requiring high dose survivability. A wide scale production of advanced low power, low voltage SIMOX substrates with a United States manufacturing base is predicted.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The purpose of the VMIS is to allow manufacturers the luxury of testing and perfecting manufacturing plans long before a single machine tool is turned on and resources are committed.  The VMIS will allow the user to select an available machine tool and an available inspection device, specify a proposed inspection plan and a dimensional analysis procedure, and then build and inspect hundreds (or even thousands) of virtual parts.  This will be accomplished in the span of a few minutes rather than waiting several months for the first pre-production run.  If these virtual parts indicate a high rejection rate, the process can be refined or additional diagnostic tests can be conducted within VMIS to isolate and correct the problems.  All this would go on before the pressure of idle resources forces a compromise in quality.\r \r The Virtual Measuring Device (kinematic model of the CMM structure), Dimensional Analysis (mathematical fitting algorithms), and Data Generation (measurement strategy) Modules of this project combine to yield a Virtual Coordinate Measuring Machine (VCMM) as defined in the referenced Solicitation Subtopic.  To test this VCMM we need a source of parts with known errors.  What better source than a Virtual Machine Tool.  The Virtual Machine Tool Module will receive minimal emphasis under this proposal.  It is merely a convenient and efficient method of producing virtual test parts with known anomalies.",

The virus envelope fusion (F protein) represents an ideal target for passive immunotherapy because antibodies to this protein typically bind to and neutralize both of the two clinical subgroups of this virus, A and B. In addition, antibodies to the F protein have been shown to provide protection in animal models of RSV. We will produce human MAbs, which are capable of in vitro and in vivo neutralization and which are useful for the treatment of this significant pathogen. Human B cells will be immortalized using three approaches: EBV transformation, somatic cell fusion, and hu-SCID mouse expansion followed by EBV transformation. Immortalized human B cells will be screened for antibody activity to the F protein. F protein reactive B cells will be cloned and their antibodies tested for virus-neutralizing activity. The immunoglobulin genes from the selected B cell clones will be transfected into a mammalian expression system for generation of antibodies for clinical evaluation.",

The basis of this infrastructure is a critical mass of the leading platform vendors adopting an object-based distributed computing specification: Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA).  We propose to advance current CORBA technology through the development of two key innovations: (1) run-time (dynamic) or compile-time (static) semantic-based composition and synthesis of reusable software components and (2) the ability to replicate and manage critical software elements). The Reliable Object Management Service (ROMS) will enable the deployment of fault-tolerant services based on object replication and management.  Critical operations will be able to continue in a gracefully degraded fashion if any one copy of a system element fails.  The long-range goal of this proposed work is to overcome barriers to building and deploying systems from verified, reusable software components.  Reusable component-ware will result in significant reductions in the cost of system testing and requirements validation for mission-critical systems.",

An alternateapproach is to block access of cocaine to the central nervous system by the generation of anti-cocaineantibody. This research will determine the feasibility of an active immunization approach to preventrelapse in cocaine addiction. Cocaine or cocaine derivatives will be used to haptenate defined carriers.These conjugates will be used to immunize mice. If high titer cocaine-specific antibody can be generatedwhich blocks toxic effects upon cocaine challenge it suggests antibody elicited via immunization canblock CNS mediated re-enforcing properties of cocaine. The ability of defined conjugate immunizationto alter self-addiction in animal models will be studied in Phase II. Provided efficacy in animal modelsis demonstrated, immunization with defined conjugates can be tested in concert with current substanceabuse treatment programs for its ability to prevent relapse in cocaine addiction in humans within 3-4years.",

This project attemptsto improve detection and diagnosis of breast masses in dense breast tissue by developing an ultrasoundimaging system that correlates with x-ray mammography. The approach is (1) develop compressionpaddles which allow transmission of ultrasound without undue attenuation or multiple reflections and(2) to ultrasonically scan the breast while it is held by ultrasound transmission compression paddleswhich provide the same pressure and breast orientations that are used in x-ray mammography. Twoexperimental ultrasound imaging systems based on this approach have been developed at IBC. One unitis designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of an instrument which combines x-ray and ultrasound.The other unit, which does not include x-ray, is designed for patients for whom x-ray mammography isinappropriate. These prototypes, which have many advantages over the hand-held transducer methodscurrently used for breast ultrasound, will undergo further development, and clinical studies will. becarried out with the goal of obtaining data that will encourage the development of commercialinstruments based on these new concepts.",

Major contributors to insomnia include periodic limbmovements (PLM) in sleep and restless legs (RL). Night-to-night variability and expensive, inconvenienttesting limits clinical and research work with these conditions. This project will develop technologyneeded to produce a self-contained, easily-used, ambulatory leg activity monitor (LAM) that will detectand record over several days the occurrence of characteristic periodic movements. The data, transferredto a Computer are analyzed for PLM and RL rates. This provides the first objective measurement of allnaturally occurring RL and of all PLM over several nights. The LAM technology uses piezoelectricsensors to detect activity and microprocessors to pre-process data by identification of candidate periodicmovements and storage of periodicity information. This permits recording all periodic movements for16 or more consecutive day. Phase 1 tests feasibility of accurately capturing and correctly identifyingall periodic movements. Phase 2 will serve to establish the LAM as a very user-friendly standard fordiagnosis, severity assessment, screening and treatment evaluation. The LAM may provide efficientearly detection of neuroleptic induced akathisia for psychiatric patients.",

Ultrasound equipment designed for use on humans is not suitable for non-invasivemonitoring of cardiovascular parameters in mice due to small organ size (5 mm dia heart) and high heartrates (400-600 bpm). We propose to develop an instrument to measure cardiac output and myocardialfunction non-invasively in mice and other small animals. The goal is to achieve measurementsresolutions on the order of l ms in time, 0.1 mm in cardiac dimensions, and l cm/s in blood flow velocity.A miniature high frequency (20 MHz) ultrasonic transducer and pulsed Doppler instrumentation will bedesigned to measure aortic blood flow velocity and a high resolution M-mode echocardiograph (at 20MHz) will be designed to measure cardiac dimensions and motion. The ultrasonic transmitter-receiverportions of the Doppler/M-mode and real time digital signal processing hardware will be interfaced witha personal computer for display and analysis. The system will be validated using static phantoms andtested on mice. In Phase II we will integrate these parts into a versatile computer-based ultrasonicmeasurement and analysis system for small animals ranging from mice to rabbits.",

Before such transducers are made this stris of the alloy with the proper crystalline orientation which maximizes the anisotropic magnetostrictive behavior must be manufactured. An innovative and novel appraoch using a melt spinning technique is proposed. With this approach it is believed that the cooling rate in the ribbons can be adequately controlled to generate a columnar microstructure of hemagonal crystals with the o axis oriented along the thickness of the melt spun ribbons. The m or b axis, the axis of maximum magnetostriction, will be aligned along the length or width of the ribbon allowing the ribbon to be stacked to form a very sensitive magnetostrictive transducer. This is contrasted to conventional melt spinning methods where the existence of thermal gradients in the ribbons limits the degree of orientation. The degree of optimal orientation can be further enhanced and controlled by appropriate additional processing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Concrete is used extensively for building defense and civilian structures as it is highly damage resistant, inexpensive, durable and can be cast into any form.  Concrete can be subjected to a variety of extremely large stress events.  The survivability of concrete structures could be enhanced if the mechanical behavior of concrete at elevated stresses and strain rates was known.  This information can be obtained from the equation of state of concrete.  Typically, the equation of state is obtained from shock wave tests.  This approach can be expensive and time consuming, especially if the magnitude of the strain and the strain rate need to be controlled.  An alternative technique, in this proposal, is to determine the equation of state of concrete and geological materials by measuring the elastic properties as a function of applied load and eliminates the need for sample constraint to prevent shear failure.  With the knowledge obtained from the equation of state, it will be possible to enhance the survivability of defense and civilian structures if they are exposed to high strain events.",

Our principal aim is todevelop and test training modules specifically designed to improve client functioning in the areas ofemployment, legal responsibility, family and social interactions, and psychiatric difficulties througheffective training of counselors who treat chemical dependency problems (medical problems will not beincluded) . The training modules will be designed for counselors and other mental health professionalswho conduct the substance abuse treatment in this country. Each module will include a manual to beused in conjunction with specially developed videotapes. The effectiveness of these training materialswill be empirically tested. specifically the central hypothesis is that the clients of counselors trained ineach of the modules will achieve superior outcomes in targeted areas over the clients of counselors whohave not received the training. Affordable, transferrable training modules with demonstrated efficacyin improving the functional outcomes of clients of CD counselors will have wide-spread utility throughoutthe country including hospitals, clinics, mental health centers, and other agencies offering chemicaldependency treatment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The characteristics of low grazing angle propagation over the ocean are an important factor in understanding the potential performance of systems in a wide variety of applications, including communication links, radar detection of low flying targets, and periscope detetion. To that end, propagation data has been taken at VHF/UHF over the ocean under the ARPA-sponsored ADI Mountain-Top program. this data has been reduced to some degree, however, a detailed analysis of the data for the purposes of model validation has yet to be performed. To fully realize the benefits of this measurement program, the data must be analyzed, characterized, and used to validate propagation and scattering models which can be used for performance analysis of advanced radar and communications systems. Information Systems Laboratories, Inc. and CODAR Ocean Sensors, Ltd., propose to analyze a subset of the propagation data under Phase I. This will allow for a preliminary comparison of the data propagation and scattering models. Based on this preliminary analysis, a detailed test plan will be developed to analyze the remaining Mountain-Top propagation data and validate models for use in radar and communication system performance analysis. Anticipated Benefits: It is anticipated that this work would benefit many radar and communication system programs in the HF/VHF band, including both military and commercial systems. There are many commercial applications involving radio waves near the sea. Maritime communications systems often involve transmitters and receivers just above the sea Commercial radars are being used increasingly to map ocean surface currents and to monitor sea state, including those made by CODAR Ocean Sensors, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Near-absolute net-shape processing utilizing MIT/MMCC's high rate pressure infiltration casting process for manufacturing brake calipers is proposed, with Allied-Signal providing design and mechanical testing support gratus. The first objective is to demonstrate the ability to manufacture near-absolute net-shape brake calipers meeting TACOM's design requirements, including a weight reduction for calipers of 60%, for the DEMO III PLS (Palletized Loading System) test vehicle. The second objective is to optimize alumina reinforced A1 alloy systems and to generate a preliminary data base on the optimized system for brake calipers. Over 1,200 net-shpate mechanical test specimens will be manufactured for the materials system optimization and preliminary data base studies with minor machining required, thus demonstrating the near-absolute net-shape capability of the process and a machining cost saving of $60,000. MMCC will perform metrology on each specimen and tooling wear and stability studies to evaluate the near-absolute net-shape capability of the process. MMCC will also evaluate the design of mold tooling for maximum re-use. A third objective is to manufacture four prototype calipers. The final objective is to develop a process cost model for brake calipers. Anticipated Benefits: A highly precise casting method capable of lower costs than die casting or squeeze casting will be developed for reinforced as well as unreinforced castings. A 60% reduction in unsprung weight of brake calipers for army trucks will become available. Such weight reductions will be attractive for commercial automotive applications, including conrods, wrist pins, piston crowns, diesel head inserts, rocker arms, \"H\" arms, \"A\" arms as well as brake calipes and disk brakes.",

Existing optionsare either generalized (conferences or design guides) or expensive (hiring a specialized consultant). ThisSBIR will develop in environmental self-assessment protocol, providing an inexpensive means to conductfacility-specific assessments. The protocol will be derived using both rational and empirical techniques.First, an expert panel of consultants will participate in the development and refinement of an exhaustivelist of environmental attributes posited to be therapeutic to cognitively impaired individuals, which willbe translated into the assessment protocol. Secondly, this preliminary protocol will be administered in60 SCUs. Third, the data will be subjected to factor analysis to empirically derive the conceptuallymeaningful items for inclusion in the final protocol.

THE FLOW IN THE EXHAUST PLUME IS NOT ONLY SUPERSONIC AND VERY HOT BUT USUALLY CONTAINS ALUMINUM PARTICLES, WHICH CHANGE THE PROPERTIES OF THE PLUME GAS AND CAUSE INTENSE THERMAL RADIATION. METHODS ARE REQUIRED FOR A RELIABLE PREDICTION OF THE HEAT TRANSFER COEFFICIENT ON SURFACES EXPOSED TO THE ROCKET EXHAUST. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PRESENT PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A COMPUTATIONAL METHOD FOR OBTAINING THE LOCAL AND OVERALL HEAT TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS ON THE SOLID SURFACES IN THE EXHAUST PLUME. THE PROJECT TEAM AT INNOVATIVE RESEARCH, INC. WILL USE ITS GENERAL EXPERTISE IN THE AREA OF COMPUTATION OF FLUID FLOW, HEAT TRANSFER, AND THERMAL RADIATION.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The wavelet transform has generated excitement among researchers from a wide range of disciplines.  Wavelets have an extremely rich mathematical foundation and have been proven valuable for a variety of applications.  New ideas are being pursued at a breathtaking pace leading to innovative algorithms.  The challenge before us now is to identify and harness these ideas and develop a coherent set of tools which can be applied to practical problems in signal and image processing.  The central focus of this proposal is to develop a complete and mature methodology for signal recovery and de-noising based on wavelets.  We use the term wavelets in a broad sense to include the many wavelet-like transforms such as wavelet packets and local cosine bases.  We will improve and extend existing procedures to correct for artifacts and handle more general problems.  Based on our research, we will build an object-oriented software toolkit using the S-Plus language.  The toolkit will provide a rich foundation of tools for wavelet de-noising.  We will evaluate the procedures using real and simulated data drawn from a variety of applications, including signal recovery, signal detection and classification, inverse problems (parameter estimation), density estimation, and image and image array reconstruction and enhancement.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         For most security systems covering large facilities, the initial detection is the easiest part of the surveillance problem.  Once alerted to a possible intrusion, response personnel often must physically challenge human intruders to verify the intruder as authorized or unauthorized.  The authentication procedure varies but commonly employs either verbal challenge or visual inspection of a badge or other documentation.  During this challenge, an electro-optic or infrared surveillance camera is often employed to monitor the proceedings.  From a remotely positioned camera, however, it is difficult or impossible to distinguish the response team personnel from the intruders.  Without this knowledge, it may be difficult to assess a situation and react properly to it.  Some type of detection system is therefore required that can be used on conjunction with the camera system to remotely identify response personnel and distinguish them from possible intruders.  To solve this problem, ISI proposes a program to develop a low cost innovative concept to identify human intruders in restricted areas with the following goals:  1. The analysis and specification of system requirements.  2. Generation and feasibility analysis of system concepts.  3. Technical risk reduction and demonstration of the concept.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Rural community telecommunications services are far behind the state-of-the art as found in urban areas.  As a result, rural communities may not participate in the benefits of access to the National Information Infrastructure now being defined.  Recent advances in wireless communictions technology, and FCC authorization of Personal Communications Services (PCS), present an opportunity to define a low-cost, high performance infrastructure for voice, data, and video communications.  This applied research effort seeks to verify the technical feasibility of wireless local or metropolitan area-network (LAN/MAN) technology as a basis for this infrastructure.  A LAN/MAN would function as a real-time community forum where users could access information related to distance learning, health care, local government activities, local community activities, and local business activities; and also obtain high-speed connectivity to other networks such as the Internet.  The Phase I research will define the functional elements of a system to provide such services.  A review of recent research has identified pertinent technologies and product types that will be modeled and analyzed.  This will validate key aspects of system architecture and define key performance requirements for system elements.  Planned coordination with residents of rural Colorado communities will verify that the proposed services are appropriate for the rural markets.",

This project will involve the evaluation of integrated optoelectronic circuits in the inversion channel technology as the building blocks for image processing system applications. An evaluation will be made of the system processing speed, power and size for a proposed packaging approach. The fanout tradeoffs will be determined. The evaluation will determine a suitable architecture from the five possibilities of an optical artificial neural network, an optical quadratic processor, an optical morphological processor and an interferometric processor. The integrated optics approach will be evaluated versus the 3D interconnect scheme based on their potential to produce 2D arrays. The inversion channel circuits will be shown to provide an ideal approach to implement free-space interconnects with a high density of electronic gates simultaneously together with emission and detection at the pixel location.",

This new system also promises a reduction in noise, size and costs.  This concept, named the dual channel down converter (DCDC), has been successfully demonstrated in a preliminary test.  This SBIR effort proposed to investigate several modifications to the hardware.  These modifications have three objectives.  first, some of the modification swill serve to remedy shortcomings identified during the preliminary use of the DCDC.  Second, some will serve to increase the performance of the hardware.  Third, some will reduce the cost of a measurement system based on the DCDC concept.  An industrial partner has been identified for this project, Wiltron Company in Morgan Hill, California.  The potential commercial products form this effort include a network analyzer on a computer card and versatile, low cost RF measurement systems.  Wiltron's experience in the design, manufacture and sales of RF and microwave equipment will greatly enhance the possibility of a commercial product resulting from this effort.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal addresses the development of a compact, high-speed camera system that integrates a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) solid-state imager and a Temporal Cellular Neural Network (TCNN) (using three-dimensional TC technology) to provide real-time image processing capability for scientific and engineering applications. The integrated CCD/TCNN camera provides high-speed image collection and processing, automatic Target Recognition (ATR), and target tracking.  One camera implementation that will be investigated involves using the biologically realistic Hybrid Temporal Processing Element (HTPE), developed by and available exclusively to IRSI (patent pending), the HTPE is a VLSI-based spiking neuron model that has several characteristics which make it well suited for high speed image processing applications.  The initial camera prototype will employ commercially available and custom VLSI components.  The CCD imager, digital processor, and positioning system will be off-the-shelf and the remainder of the components will be custom VLSI.  Also, in the initial prototype,m the VLSI components will be fabricated in a planar IC technology. This simplified design approach for the initial prototype will allow rapid proof-of-concept.  Ultimately, the camera will be a fully-integrated system implemented in state-of-the-art three dimensional VLSI technology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Despite the fact that multi-chip modules (MCMs) are a critical dual use technology, the rapid commercialization of MCM-based systems depends on achieving an order of magnitude reduction in NRE costs and development time as well as assuring first pass success in MCM design. Hoever, data collected by MCM contractors reveals that the absence of proper design process management was the major barrier for achieving such goals. To greatly improve MCM design process management practices, this research effort will propose and develop an MCM Design Process manager consisting of a design process representation, a design process integration mechanism, and a design process management framework. The key technical innovations for this effort include a multi-perspective family of MCM design processes, an open system methodology for integrating EDA frameworks, and a computer-aided MCM design process management methodology. This software will orchestrate the various activities, resources, and roles in the MCM design by serving as a \"forcing function\" to the collaborative design process as well as a \"tracking and measurement mechanism\" during design. Anticipated Benefits: Achieving an order of magnitude reduction in module cost and cycle time with first pass design success will make Multi-chip Modules a commercially viable technology for the U.S. computer, consumer electronics, telecommunications, and automotive industries. Affordable MCM technology will play a major role in making these industries globally competitive.",

This builds onSculpt, a prototype graphical modeling system that maintains many protein properties as oneinteractively moves atoms. Phase I adds the following interactive capabilities through mathematicalanalysis and algorithm development: 1. edit protein topology interactively allowing residue insertion,deletion, and substitution; 2. assemble multiple chains (e.g. from homology) with valid peptide geometry;3. decompose a model into regions with restricted, limited, or unrestricted atom motions; 4. movesecondary structure directly while modeling sidechain interactions with other atoms; 5. modelelectrostatic interactions. Phase II further develops these algorithms and concentrates on interfaceissues. This will directly produce commercial software for protein modeling and develop a foundationfor later products in crystallography, de novo drug design, structure determination based on NMR,nucleotide modeling, and education.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose to continue our development of a non-invasive probe of the electrical quality of semiconductor wafers. This technique can be used to screen wafers or to ascertain total impact of specific process steps; it may serve as a routine qualification of some processes. Modern manufacturing technology requires an increasingly detailed statistical summary of the impact of processes on devices. Non-invasive techniques that can probe samples without interfering with a process line operation are crucial in this goal. We have already implemented this minority-carrier lifetime measurement to characterize Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) samples as thin as 50 nm. We propose to extend the performance to shorter lifetimes (permitting more and thinner materials to be studied) and to smaller regions (permitting use as a monitor of product wafers). In addition, we intend to improve existing technology to permit rapid and routine operation. While useful for many materials this technique has proven especially useful in studies of SOI materials, since the superficial silicon films are electrically isolated from the substrate and therefore more difficult to characterize even by standard invasive techniques.",

The objective of this project is to determine  the feasibility and cost of this technology for application to Navy  submarines.  This will be accomplished in five tasks:  1) Submarine  laundry items will be washed using a commercial ozonated water process  to show acceptable cleaning; 2) A set of feasibility and cost analyses  will be performed on this concept to determine its ability to reduce  graywater waste and meet all submarine requirements including  significant reduction in graywater waste volume; 3) A hardware concept  for a submarine laundry will be developed; 4) Design a submarine  laundry Phase II prototype and write a test plan; and 5) Analyze the  use of ozone to treat galley and shower waste streams.  We anticipate  the results to these tasks will show significant reductions in  graywater waste can be achieved using ozone technology for all ships  and industrial sites.",

Microactuators are still mostly experimental. An excellent application for microsensors and actuators is in vibration sensing and control. Frequency selective vibration sensors using piezoresistive materials on cantilevered beam harmonic oscillators have already been produced in the laboratory. Smart materials including piezoelectric and piezoresistive materials can be applied to vibration sensing in structural components. The purpose of this proposed effort is to produce a device designed to monitor vibrations in equipment and structures, and to optimize the design for manufacturing. The goal is to develop an integrated micromechanical sensor that can be used to measure the vibrational modes of operating equipment in high \"g\" and other adverse environments. The device will perform an instantaneous fast Fourier transform in the frequency range from very low to ultrasonic frequencies. It will have minimum energy consumption requirements and be extremely small, rugged and lightweight. Anticipated Benefits: Benefits include the development of new devices for measuring vibrations in structures and equipment such as rotorcraft. The commercial production of micromechanical devices is beneficial to the US economy, the integrated circuit processing industry and new MEM processing industry in particular. This project will show the applicability of microscale components to the solutions of engineering problems. These miniature devices have important medical military and commercial uses.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         During a shipboard emergency, damage control supervisors must quickly get to the location of the incident and immediately begin evaluating the type, level, and location of the damage. The supervisor must draw upon and assimilate vast amounts of information, often relying on years of experience and training. The high stress associated with damage control environments, however, can result in an individual's failure to take into account valuable information. The supervisor's job is often made more difficult by the presence of smoke and obsurants which can severely limit vision, potentially delaying the supervisor's arrival at the site and/or affecting the accuracy of the evaluation. The combined lack of information and visual ability can severely impact the accuracy and timeliness of damage control assessments. A delayed or erroneous classification of type or severity could potentially result in a loss of equipment, mobility, readiness, or life. The contractor shall attempt to increase the responsiveness and effectiveness of damage control supervisors through the use of wearable hands-free computers equipped with infrared sensors. Such a system would enable individuals to \"see\" through smoke and obscurants while simultaneously and effortlessly accessing large amounts of computer-based data.",

As a consequence, an innovative dry plating process has been developed. This process would eliminate liquids, and minimize solid waste using situ reclaim. This plasma assisted dry plating would be an economical alternative to electroplating. In recent years, zinc-cadmium alloy plating has shown promise for reducing toxic cadium plating. This zinc-cadmium alloy can be plated using the dry plating process. However, a basic understanding of the process and its effects could be explored. A systematic research using statistical experimental design method is proposed to develop this understanding. In addition, the frictional properties of the alloy as a function of composition will be studied for potential application. Successful completion of this research could lead to substantial reduction in hazardous waste in many defense plating operations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Poultry producers are faced with growing difficulties in controlling pests associated with poultry manure, particularly house flies.  Expanding urbanization and public concern about flies associated with poultry facilities lead to confrontation or litigation.  Producers have few chemically based options available for fly control because of insecticide resistance and loss of insecticides to regulatory concerns.  Proven biological and cultural control options provide alternatives to the use of insecticides and support existing natural enemies of the house fly.\r \r This project is designed to provide producers with a renewable fly control option using an important natural enemy of flies associates with poultry houses.  The hister beetle, Carcinops pumilio, is a significant predator of fly eggs and larvae that occurs in large populations in well established poultry houses.  However, to avoid Salmonella outbreaks, poultry producers routinely fumigate houses between flocks.  This process destroys the beetle population which are then difficult to re-establish under natural conditions.  In contrast, the fly population re-establishes quickly usually resulting in a fly outbreak.  Producers could avoid fly outbreaks by artificially establishing a predatory beetle population in the poultry house before house flies become established.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Under realistic operational conditions, high speed networks can be stressed or overloaded with a wide mixture of message flows corresponding to a multitude of service classes. It is essential that the network and system parameters and services, at each relevant communications layer, are set-up so that the network can properly support high performance realtime message streams serving mission critical distributed computer systems. Critical realtime performance features, including measures of delay, delay jitter, throughput, synchronization, scheduling, and reliability must be tightly controlled in an integrated services networking environment. The purpose of this proposed work is to use the structure of the currently existing IRI \"Planyst\" tool, to develop in Phase I models and methods that can then be used in Phase II for the development of a software based prototype tool for the planning and analysis of distributed realtime computer networks. The tool will also be used for calibrating the communications networking processes and parameters of realtime service support algorithms. The latter will be implemented within the multiple protocol layers, and across many subsystems and networks. Such networks include SAFENET and FDDI networks, packet switching and ATM cell switching networks, and interconnect processors which include multiplexers, bridges, routers, and switches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Irvine Sensors proposes to use its 3D silicon chip stacking technology to provide the increase in packaging density required to support second-generation massively parallel computers. Using the third dimension to stack processor devices, promises to reduce substrate cost in direct relation to the number of processors stacked meeting the ten fold or more improvement in substrate costs by reducing the required substrate area. In addition, power and performance figures of merit will be improved as well. Reduced capacitive loading, caused by the asbsence of packages and by 3D silicon's extremely short interconnection wiring lines will lead to even better performance and lower power dissipation that previsouly achieved in other hybrid-WSI technologies. Typical interchip bussing distances for 3D silicon are on the order of tens of mils (0.010 inches), while those associated with other technologies are on the order of hundreds of mils. Also, Irvine Sensors' interconnect technology is pure resistive versus standard wire bonds which contain a good deal of inductance. This means less noise, and less current to charge and discharge signal nodes increasing performance and minimizing power.",

One method will enumerate and identify the erythrocytes and reticulocytescontaining hemoglobin F and the other would quantify the percentage of hemoglobin F in bloodhemolysates. The development of these kits is facilitated in this laboratory by the availability ofmonoclonal antibodies against hemoglobin F. This obviously permits the development of better methodsthan the cytologic acid elution method of Kleihauer or the alkaline precipitation methods of Betke. Thus,using available antibody, the Investigator plans to develop a enzyme link immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA)to quantify the absolute level of hemoglobin F in red blood cell lysates and secondly to develop afluorochrome conjugated immunoassay to specifically enumerate the intact red blood cells which producehemoglobin F. The kits will be developed which could use either flow cytometry and/or fluorescencemicroscopy to enumerate hemoglobin F cells in the fluorochrome conjugated immunoassay. The lattermethodology would permit measurements of the relative proportion of reticulocytes containing Hb F ifdual staining was used or studies of the nature of the other Hb molecules which share the sameerythrocytes with Hb F and the relative amounts of Hb F within individual cells. A simple assay suchas those described would be highly useful in drug studies developed to increase hemoglobin F synthesisto ameliorate the severity of sickle cell disease.Likewise, it may be useful in studies which were desiredto determine the number of fetal nucleated red cells that entered the maternal circulation.",

The method is based on the use of a radio frequency-modulated light source. Measurement of phase shift and demodulation ratio are used to independently determine the scattering and absorption coefficients along the average path traveled by light in the tissue between this source and a detector. In our apparatus, the phase and demodulation can be accurately measured in real time on a millisecond time base. The important field of application of this tissue spectrometer is in medicine for measuring low concentrations of absorbing metabolites in tissues. In the proposed prototype, the modulated source consists of an array of laser diodes emitting at selected wavelengths relevant to the oxygenation state of the tissue. During Phase I of this project, a prototype instrument for research purposes will be assembled and tested both for integration of new components and limits of the technology. In Phase II absorption and scattering coefficients at different tissue locations will allow imaging of optical properties of tissues. Clinical tests will be performed at the end of Phase II.",

[1] Fatigue failures are often catastrophic and without warning. For these reasons, the management of the effects of fatigue is of extreme importance to operators of fleets of aging aircraft. The U.S. Navy, for example, expends more than 2,000,000 man-hours per year managing aging effects on aircraft. [2] The ability to nondestructively detect and quantify accumulated fatigue damage, prior to the formation of detectable cracks, would be vitally important to that effort. This ability would permit earlier identification of areas experiencing accelerated aging due to fatigue, prompting modifications to inspection and maintenance programs. Cost savings and improved safety would follow. JENTEK Sensors, Inc., in an on-going Phase I SBIR grant from the Department of Energy, has recently demonstrated the capability to measure accumulated fatigue damage on specimens of stainless steel. This proposal involves the adaptation of this new capability to inspection of naval aircraft.",

We propose a hybrid SAF control architecture that integrates neural networks with rule-based systems to enable human like learning, allowing a SAF system to continuously learn from manned simulators, human instructors, and its own mistakes. This technology will make SAF behaviors more realistic, and will save time and money by permiting Battle Trainers to modify SAF behavior without the intervention of programmers. The development team includes experts in robotic skill acquisition and neural network-based control, as well as some of the original developers of SIMNET SAF. Phase I will determine how to integrate concepts of hybrid coorperative and reinforcement learning into an existing SAF system, demonstrate behavior augumentation and performance gains attributable to SAF learning for two battle scenarios, and propose a method for integrating such learning into state-of-the-art ModSAF and Distributed Interactive Simulation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         There is no doubt that composite materials can be used to produce very light weight, high performance shelters, including shelters satisfying all ISO requirements.  All three members of this proposal team have been involved over the last 15 years with programs emphasizing different aspects of composite ISO shelter design, fabrication, and testing.  The primary factor inhibiting the routine usage of composite shelters by the military has been their high acquisition cost.  An approach to composite shelter design that from the outset uses an integrated design/build team approach to assure that shelter configurations are chosen to take maximum advantage of automated composite manufacturing technology is required to reduce cost.  During Phase I the proposal team will design composite ISO shelters using three different philosophies - a part-for-part replacement of the aluminum ISO shelter components currently in military service, a minimum weight design with little regard for cost, and a balanced cost/weight design emphasizing component tailoring for automated production technology. Pultrusion, filament winding, RTM, compression molding and braiding will all be evaluated for potential applicability to cost effective fabrication.  Large scale part integration made possible by automated manufacturing techniques will play a key role in cost reduction.",

We are developing a suckometer with the long term application to various aspects of neonatal and post-natal care and study. This research focuses on the feeding behavior of very low birth weight infants with ultimate application to infants with other feeding problems due to congenital abnormality and other causes. The methodology used is based on the Kron sucking device which uses a specially designed nipple with linear flow restrictor. The restrictor transduces the intraoral pressure developed by a suckling infant into a pressure-time signal that can be analyzed to give a number of parameters relating to infant status. Previous research has shown the applicability of the method to evaluating the clinical state of full term and preterm infants. The present work is directed to developing specialized nipples and associated analysis software for studying the feeding behavior, development of sucking and swallowing of immature infants, and the related problems of infant care and transition to normal feeding activity. Such equipment and methodology should find a market in most newborn birthing facilities, infant intensive care units, and in similar facilities that specialize in the care of low birthweight and congenitally abnormal infants. This market has grown considerably in recent years due to the significant improvement in care leading to much higher survival rates of such infants, but increasing the population of infants with serious feeding problems.",

In addition, the pace of warfare will accelerate. C4I functions, attempting to meet the demands for accelerated planning cycles, will continue to require decision making under uncertainty. Next-generation C4I information management and decision support systems will need carefully designed human-computer interfaces to allow commanders and staff members to handle the uncertainty. It is critical that these interfaces support intuitive decision-making strategies, or else they may not be used, or may actually result in degraded performance. We propose to take advantage of recent breakthroughs in the field of naturalistic decision making. We will identify the key strategies used for managing uncertainty, and define human-computer interface features to support these strategies. The project will select a C4I system in development. To demonstrate the feasibility of building C4I displays that can help decision makers manage uncertainty, we will develop storyboards for an interface that will increase the effectiveness of the system. Phase II will cover software development and evaluation, and the presentation of design procedures the U.S. Marine Corps can use to enhance its C4I systems.",

Rats and mice are replacing larger mammals in cardiac research for budgetaryand societal reasons. No suitable chronic implantable pressure preparations are now available.Implantable transducers have been shown to substantially reduce mortality and morbidity in experimentalanimals, permitting longer surveillance time, better quality data. Methodology for achieving goals:design/procure .23 x .30 mm strain gages; design/fabricate 1.3 mm dia transducers; develop newmetal/semiconductor interface to reduce baseline drift. The 1.3 mm implantable prototype transducercan be produced in Phase I. Success will justify feasibility of Phase II goals: economic productiondesign; implantable low compliance dome/cannula systems for mice; support electronics. Experiencewith larger-sized implantable transducers has shown extension of such technology to innovativeconfigurations in other species/organs applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Wavelet transforms have already proved to be very useful tools in many signal processing applications including digital audio and video compression.  Although the wavelet-based representations offer more versatility in time-frequency localization than other Fourier methods, they tend to have  poor localization especially near high frequencies.  To eliminate this difficulty, we propose a technique for analyzing signals of time-varying characteristics using adaptive wavelet packets, which facilitates identification of arbitrarily localized spectral characteristics.  For nonstationary signals that contain varying distribution of spectral energy, the analysis must adaptively select filters of different localization properties.  Wavelet-packets designed through digital filter banks offer arbitrary tiling of the time-frequency domain.  Herley et al. [1993] report a double-tree algorithm that combines selection for the best wavelet-packet expansion with an adaptive time-segmentation of the signal simultaneously.  The system we propose here is an extension of the above algorithm together with a choice of a basis function from a library of wavelet packets.  We also propose to develop the pattern recognition capabilities based on feature vectors computed from the compressed signals.  A real-time prototype wavelet transform processor will be available in Phase II on an inexpensive parallel hardware called PC - CNAPS that operates as an accelerator board to a PC.",

The applicators will be developed specifically for use with that system, though somehardware and software modifications will be necessary to accept the new applicators. Phase I goals areto improve the performance of the SONOTHERM (R) system for treatment of breast and chest walllesions by examining (a) higher frequency applicator operation to limit penetration depth where indicated,(b) simultaneous multifrequency operation to provide depth of penetration varying over the face of theultrasound applicator array, and (c) improved means for coupling these new applicators for breast andchest wall treatments. Phase II will be devoted to the construction of clinical testing versions ofapplicators and other ancillary hardware and software developed during Phase I, and to conduct FDAsanctioned clinical trials at selected sites within the SONOTHERM(R) 1000 user base in the U.S. todetermine the safety and effectiveness of the new devices.",

Organic and polymeric NLO materials are excellent candidates for these applications.  Current materials experience a dielectric relaxation of the aligned structure which prevents them from being used in practical devices.  The design and synthesis of a new class of second-order nonlinear optical polymers with large molecular nonlinearities, increased processabilities and exceptional thermal, temporal and photochemical stabilities are proposed.  The second-order chromospheres are designed to possess an arylamine structure, the use of which not only increases their molecular nonlinearities, but also dramatically improves their thermal stabilities.  These chromospheres are then covalently attached to a high glass transition temperature polyimide backbone.  During the electric field poling process, the polymers undergo crosslinking reaction through which additional resistance to chromosphere dipolar relaxation is achieved.",

Characteristics of this fiber-optic based warning receiver include an extremely low profile on an aircraft surface, light weight, durability, and low cost. The Phase I effort will yield a laboratory demonstration that will provide experimental confirmation of this performance. The Phase II effort will result in a threat warning sensor brassboard for field testing and demonstration that meets these specifications and additionally can indicate the threat laser repetition frequency to better than 1%. The Phase II effort will also investigate production issues such as cost, size, and weight.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Flight simulators involving dome projection displays are a critical part of current and future aircrew training systems.  Owing to current technology, dome simulators typically resort to a low resolution background with an additional target projector which overlays a higher resolution target on the background image on the dome surface.  In order to circumvent these shortcomings, simulators capable of displaying the large amounts of information involved in today's trainers require extremely high resolution and brightness not available with current projection display technology.  Recent breakthroughs at Laser Power Corp (LPC) have led to the development of red, green, and blue (RGB) laser technology which could hold the key to a revolution in the projection display arena.  A high resolution, full-color, microlaser based projection display is proposed to address super resolution, HDTV requirements for large display applications. Microlaser based projection displays promise high resolution and luminance with the largest color gamut of all competitive technologies in a compact, power efficient, and cost competitive package.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Very light sensors having a fast response time are required for making direct, nonintrusive measurements in a propulsion system environment. In order to monitor key physical parameters in this environment, it will be necessary to develop new concepts in sensor design to measure such things as temperature and pressure. Present day sensors will not operate reliably in this environment and are much too large. Fiber optic sensors offer a possible solution to this problem. Lasergeneics Corporation is proposing to investigate single crystal fibers of YAG and YALO for this application. These materials can withstand the harsh environment that will exist. We are proposing a unique approach that would allow the measurement of both temperature and pressure with a single fiber optic. This concept will be tested during the Phase I effort. For the Phase Ii effort we will determine sensor and data transmission link design characteristics usable in this environment and build and test such a system. Anticipated Benefits: This program can result in a new concept for fiber optic sensors for temperature and pressure in harsh environments. They could find wide application in process control in the steel, chemical, and semiconductor industries, in fossil fuel and nuclear power generation plants, in plasma, fusion, MHD, combustion and chemical research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Diffractive optical elements (DOEs) have great potential for use in a variety of photonic applications in communications and computer networks.  One inherent limitation is their design for a specific, narrowband source.  This requires actively controlled laser diode sources to maintain wavelength stability for compact photonic applications involving laser diodes.  The finite bandwidth resulted in reduced image quality and diffraction efficiency.  We propose a new class of achromatic DOEs that use two surface-relief elements with compensating optical properties.  These DOEs will significantly relax the requirements for laser bandwidths and frequency stability.  Because of the compensating effects of the two elements, the relief surfaces can be fabricated using a coarse tolerance process and the DOEs can be inexpensively manufactured. The relief surface produced is continuous so the efficiency of these DOEs is very high.  The process tolerances allow the relief surface to be cast on one face of a refractive element enabling unique refractive/diffractive hybrids.  In Phase I, we will construct a hybrid optic that demonstrates the achromatic performance and characterize its performance.  Existing design techniques will be extended to incorporate the unique features of these hybrid achromatic DOEs.  In Phase II, the manufacturing techniques will be refined and hybrid optics fabricated for several wavelength regions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This effort proposes to investigate novel optical transmitters with RF phase control for narrowband millimeter-wave (28-100 GHz) fiber-optic links using direct modulation of semiconductor lasers. Efficient fiber-optic transport and simultaneous, continuous phase control of the transmitted millimeter-wave signal is accomplished with the same device.  This allows military phased-array systems to exploit the advantages of fiber while reducing system cost and complexity.  Furthermore, these fiber links can provide high bandwidth services in present and future cable television and wireless communication systems.  Since this work is of obvious commercial and military interest it falls into a genuine \"dual-use\" category.  The innovative device is a split-contact monolithic semiconductor laser, cleaved to a length such that the laser round-trip cavity resonance occurs at the desired millimeter-wave frequency. Continuous control of the phase of the transmitted millimeter-wave frequency.  Continuous control of the phase of the transmitted millimeter-wave signal is accomplished by simply varying the bias current into the laser.  This task has been demonstrated at lower frequencies (1-7 GHz) using commercially available compact-disk self-pulsing lasers.  The prior success with self-pulsing lasers and the recent implementation of millimeter-wave optical transmitters using monolithic semiconductor lasers provide strong evidence for successful completion of Phase I of this effort.",

Although the RIG manual is comprehensive and has proven to be valid and reliable, itsusefulness is somewhat limited because it is in hard copy. This increases the time needed to accessimportant reference material, makes updating more difficult and inhibits the ability of users to customizethe manual to meet individual risk management philosophy. Automation of the manual will make it moreaccessible and enhance its effectiveness as an aid to clinicians involved in LTC risk identification andclassification. The prototype will assist in streamlining the clinical decision-making process, enable usersto easily reference key medical, functional and cognitive indicators relevant to LTC risk identification,and facilitate classification of individuals into LTC risk categories. An automated PC-based manualwould represent a new and innovative product which could also aid states as they assume greaterresponsibility for managing home-based LTC programs.",

The effort will utilize a 3OW CW-diode pumped Nd:YAG laser that has already been developed. This source will be combined with KTP OPO's to generate wavelengths in the 2 micron range at relatively high power. In the final stage efficient conversion to relatively high average power output in the 3 to 5 micron range will be demonstrated using ZnGePO4 OPOs. Further development of the 3OW CW-diode pumped ND:YAG source to the 10OW power level will assure success in the transition to the Phase II development where production of powers greater than 3OW in the 3-5 micron range will be achieved.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A wide variety of spectroscopic, remote sensing, and other applications would benefit from a rugged, and efficient mid-infrared laser source. The approach advocated here utilizes the mature, diode-pumped, 1 micrometer laser technology to drive an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) based on a new nonlinear frequency conversion material, periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN).  The Phase I program will consist of fabricating and characterizing the PPLN material for continuous wave (CW) frequency conversion applications, resulting in the demonstration of a compact 4 micrometer source. The focus of the Phase I program will be on the nonlinear material and the critical requirements it must satisfy to be useful for CW frequency conversion in the mid-infrared. PPLN has the unique combination of high nonlinear coefficients, low optical loss, and inherently \"engineerable\" phasematching properties (which determine the output wavelength) required for CW sources. If successful, this program (after Phase III) will yield a high power, broadly tunable (1.5 - 4.2 micrometer), CW, all-solid-state mid-infrared source in a package size of approximately 5000 cubic-centimeters (shoe box size), highly desirable for a variety of remote-sensing and industrial monitoring applications.",

Their  toxicity, size and complexity have made them undesirable for many  applications, especially in areas where Recent research has  demonstrated the feasibility of substitution of trivalent cerium into  the colquiriite lattice, which has received considerable attention  because of its single ultraviolet emission transition.  Laser  efficiencies approaching 30% with Ce:LiSAF have been demonstrated, as  has tunability spanning from 285 to 297nm.  The gain spectrum covers  the region from 280 to 320nm, thus optimization of material quality  could lead to a UV source which can tune over 4000 cm-1.  This research  is designed to optimize the Czochralski growth of the Ce:colquiriites  in order to produce boules capable of yielding slabs nominally  4x4x80mm.  The slabs would be tested in a transverse-pumping geometry  to demonstrate moderate average powers over an extended tuning range in  the UV.  The development of Ce-activated LiSAF/LiCAF will provide the  laser community with a crystal that can form the basis of the first,  all solid-state, tunable UV laser system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         EHF SATCOM is designed to provide centralized planning with distributive execution. Communications planning includes the process of CINC and Component Commands generating network requirements and requests to the central planner. The central planner is responsible for developing an appotionment of EHF service resources, which is approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for each CINC which in turn can suballocate those resources to the Component Command or allocate them to specific EHF services . The Component Commands must develop specific resource utilization plans and distribute these to the fielded EHF terminals. Implementation of the EHF services is accomplished by the terminal operators and ensuing management of the services and resource utilization is required. Due to the complexity of the EHF SATCOM systems the planners, implementers and managers require software support tools. These software tools should contain artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to perform integration of a wide variety of input data and provide optimum planning, implementation and management decisions. AI tools or algorithms can be developed to integrate information of associated, but not necessarily directly related topics to ensure that the planning, implementation and management aspects of EHF SATCOM do not violate resource allocations and provide optimized coverage, performance, network configuration and resource utilization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The supply of critical replacement parts to maintain the readiness of military units serving overseas can be a problem.  Lone Peak Engineering (LPE) has identified an opportunity to develop a solid freeform fabrication (SFF) process to manufacture functional metal components.  These metal components, prepared in a manner of hours from computer-generated models without hard tooling could be quickly shipped out as replacement parts to alleviate this supply problem.  A fully developed system could be placed in remote locations, such as onboard ships, to provide parts on an as needed basis.  This possibility could dramatically reduce the inventory of spare parts needed to maintain the Navy's ships, submarines, aircraft, and other equipment. This Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of using this SFF process to fabricate functional metal parts and tools from 316L stainless steel.  Lone Peak will team with United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) in this Phase I project.  During the Phase I project, United Technologies operating divisions will be surveyed for applications.  Parts for these applications will be made during the Phase H project.  Some possible applications include gears and injection molding tooling. The Phase H project will demonstrate that SFF-prepared metal parts and tools can be used in functional applications.  To achieve this goal, automated production procedures will be developed. Additional metal compositions will be examined.  Sintering to full density and hot isostatic pressing will be examined.  Machining and finishing techniques will be developed.",

To minimize the cost, size, and complexity of the overall system, it is inadvisable to use more than one camera for multiple resolutions of images.  This means that a single camera must operate in the focal plane of two or more imaging systems with different focal lengths.  In this program, we will design and fabricate an electronically switchable electro-optic lens.  The lens be capable of switching among multiple focal lengths.  Combinations of these switchable lenses can be used to form electro-optic zoom lenses with no moving parts.",

Current systems limit user mobility by requiring wired communication connections between the HMD and the system computer. Our proposed concepts replace the tether with wireless optical communication links.  A high-data-rate forward link is provided to carry digital video data to the HMD.  A low-data-rate return link carries position, velocity, and acceleration data from the HMD to the system computer.  In addition to removing the restrictions that are imposed on movement by tethered systems, wireless optical communications technology also offers low-weight, small-package solutions to further free user movements, and it provides the high communication bandwidths required to meet system data rates.  Our innovative approach combines versatile lasercom techniques with novel optical components.",

The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) require that specificsources install and operate CEMs to provide an accurate measurement of SO2, NOx,CO2, and opacity.  Emission data is used to insure compliance with current acidrain regulation and to track allowances for the new emissions trading program.The collection of real time emission data is used to monitor the mandatedreduction in acid rain levels.Presently, there is no requirement under the CAAA to continuously monitorparticulate matter other than opacity, which is at best a qualitative measure.This is due to the fact that no technology currently available has beensuccessfully demonstrated and accepted by industry.  this project involves aunique and highly innovative concept for a Direct Continuous Particulate Monitor.The new monitor concept has the ability to measure dust-laden streams reliablyand accurately in real time.  It also avoids the use of complex mathematicalalgorithms that are often used to indirectly correlate a mass concentration.  InPhase I, a laboratory-scale prototype will be built and tested to demonstrateperformance using stimulant feed streams.  In Phase II, the testing will shiftto a field site and testing under actual conditions.",

Initial studies used Lexan and although they showed feasibility, a stronger and more temperature resistant ultrathin substrate such as polyimide film on the order of 100 nm in thickness will be investigated.  Computer modeling based on the matrix method of Abeles as described by Heavens will be used to suggest candidate substrate and/or multilayer coating systems.  Novel instrumentation will be used to minimize stresses in the coatings that would adversely affect resulting filter performance.  Prototype filters based on the best combination of computer modeled performance and technical tractability  will be fabricated and delivered for testing at NIST.  The successful outcome will provide reference standards for IR calibration in the photonics industry as well as potential thin foil products for other IR applications, such as detector windows for thermal imaging devices.",

However, we propose a system employing state-of-the-art mass analyzers, vacuum, power sources, and electronics, forming a computer controlled, highly portable mass spectrometer system.  The modularity of the system provides design flexibility, including self contained systems specialized for unattended remote sensing (weighing a few hundred pounds with power source), to ultra compact, spot checking units (or personal exposure monitors) weighing only a few pounds.  Mass spectrometer sensing capabilities (in the parts per billion), coupled with computer analysis of the data and comparison of the spectra to fingerprint database libraries for chemical identification would provide unsurpassed, real time, in-field sensing capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Each year in the United States over 600,000 tons of regulated biomedical waste are generated by hospitals, laboratories and clinics.  Disposing of these wastes safely, economically and within environmental guidelines is a growing problem.  The accepted methods of waste treatment, such as incineration, autoclaving and shipment off-site, are the targets of increasing public concern and regulatory control.  The proposed work will evaluate the feasibility of a gaseous ozone process for converting infectious waste into more environmentally acceptable waste materials.  Ozone is attractive as a gaseous sterilant because it ie effective at low temperatures and it breaks down readily into water and oxygen so there is no undesirable liquid or gaseous effluent.  However, conventional ozone generating processes have several undesirable features including high capital costs.  The proposed sterilization process uses a fundamentally new method for making ozone offering several cost and process advantages including improved sterilant penetration qualities.  The Phase I research will evaluate the antimicrobial and sporicidal properties of this sterilization process using biological indicators and simulated medical waste. The overall goal is to develop a dual-use santitation system with environmental and cost advantages for on-site waste treatment at military and private sector hospitals.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Each individual soldier is becoming increasingly dependent on electronics and this dependency requires greater amounts of electrical power.  Before long these requirements will exceed the capabilities of batteries and a new system will be required.  Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells have the capabilities needed to fill that need.  PEM fuel cells are capable of generating electricity efficiently, with high power to weight and power to volume rations and excellent load following.  PEM fuel cells are superior to other fuel cell types for small portable applications. The active electrolyte is a solid polymeric sheet instead of a corrosive liquid supported in a solid matrix.  The PEM stack is capable of operating at ambient temperatures and pressures and requires no preconditioning or clean-up of the air supply.  Most current fuel cell stacks require significant support hardware for air supply and fuel gas handling and humidification.  The proposed system eliminates all of this.  The use of monopolar design with an ambient air cathode has eliminated the need for an air handling system.  The use of a common hydrogen manifold for the entire stack both simplifies construction and eliminates the need for any gas handling on the fuel side beyond a step-down regulator for the hydrogen supply.  This rugged, innovative design can supply the power needed in a small, light weight unit.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Traditional parenternal vaccines have many limitations which pose problems for both military and civilian vaccination programs. Parenternal vaccines must be administered by trained medical personnel, booster doses are generally required to obtain maximum protection, they are usually only effective against a single organizm and most require refrigeration.  Biodegradable, bioadherent microencapsulated (BBM) vaccines for oral administration would overcome many of these limitations.  The proposed work utulizes recombinant Fasciola hepatica eggshell proteins to form antigen containing microcapsules which will be used as an orally administered vaccine.  The recombinant Fasciola hepatica eggshell proteins were selected as microcapsule constituents specifically because of their natural biodegradable and bioadherent characteristics.  The BBM orally administered vaccine would prodide long term single dose disease protection without trained medical personnel administration.  Further, several different organisms could be encapsulated separately but administered at the same time ia and outer capsule which contained the BBM antigens.  In Phae I, the goal is to prepare a BBM tetanus vaccine for oral administration and compare its efficacy with that of a parenternally administered commercial tetanus vaccine.  In Phase II, porositu and the degree of bioadherence of the microcapsules will be fine-tuned, and animal studied will be extended to include preclinical trials.",

The key to thisproposed process is the use of a polymeric/ceramic composite membrane capable ofseparating water from glycol at high temperature to achieve an efficientseparation.  Preliminary economic analysis indicates that the capital andoperating costs can compete favorably against the existing \"truck-and-treat\"option plus other technologies including biotreatment, distillation, and reverseosmosis.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The ultra-high strength steels, AF 1410 and AerMet 100, have improved fracture toughness and stress corrosion cracking resistance, desirable mechanical properties for naval aircraft landing gears. However, the absence of accurate machining information on the various operations necessary to manufacture these and other parts has limited the use of these alloys. Significant potential improvements of in-service life of aircraft components are not being realized, along with the resulting cost savings, because of the inability to forcast machining costs and productivity levels. Comprehensive, accurate machining data, when accompanied by a simple, easy-to-use cost analysis enables the potential contractor to competitively bid on manufacturing aircraft components, based on his equipment, scheduling, and personnel limitations. Current efficient techniques for machinability and grindability tests provide the maximum statistically validated results with a minimum investment of testing time. The combined relationship of cutting speed and feed on tool life or grinding wheel wear can usually be expressed as an equation which can support computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) systems. The author of this proposal has been producing machining and grinding information for various U.S. Government agencies and private industry since 1963.",

To date, tests have been made in magnetic fields of up to 9 Tesla with positive results.  Wire prototypes are anticipated to result from ongoing efforts during 1995.  The critical temperature (Tc) is presently 700 Kelvin.  This is also the melting point of the, proprietary, polymer.  This project will explore several possible applications of the new material to fuzes.

This SBIR proposes to use the ASTROS tool with additional application software to completely develop a flight safety analysis toolset for small aircraft certification.  ASTROS is a comprehesive self-contained system.  ASTROS architecture allows easy enhancements and addition of new engineering modules.  MSI plans to develop a secondary market using ASTROS for structural safety and risk application in small aircraft certification.  The result will be a multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) toolset that will assess structural, control, navigation, human factors and other aspects of flight safety.",

These are 1) For new constructions: are current Navy specificaitons for tolerances and structureal details too stringent? Can some of them be relaxed so as to minimize ship construction costs? 2) For ships in service; how important is it to repair small damages such as dents, small cracks, initial deformations and distortions, misalignments and incorrectly built details? What criteria should be used to base a repair or replacement decision on? In both cases, the objective is to minimize cost of new constructions or repairs of in-service ships without serious degradation to structural performance. Towards this end, reliability principles will be applied in the proposed work to develop a methodology and criteria for minimizing cost, constraint by a minimum acceptable reliability level. In Phase II of the project, alternative specifications and repair/replacement criteria will be developed based on Phase I results. Both current and the proposed alternative specifications will be applied to ship structures in order to estimate the cost savings associated with the new proposed specifications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Marotta Scientific Controls, Inc. has conceived a new, multi-function Xenon gas control valve concept for isolation, pressure regulation and flow control. Xenon gas propellant is used at very low flow rates in several types of next-generation electric thrusters, including the Russian Stationary Plasma Thrusters. The Multi-function control valve uses a magnetostrictive actuator. This new actuation method can operate the valve as a simple on-off valve, or it can be precisely controlled in a modulating mode to continuously regulate the pressure or flow rate of Xenon gas. It can be operated open loop, or closed loop using pressure, flow rate or another \"thrust level indicative\" signal for feedback control. For very low flow rate applications such as the Stationary Plasma Thruster, magnetostrictive materials such as \"Terfenol-D\" promise great benefits in valving. These benefits include:  1. Simplification of the system by combining on-off and regulating valves in one multi-function valve; 2. Increased reliability and increased  tolerance to contamination due to very high operating forces; 3. Simple designs, amenable to miniaturization; 4. Higher frequency response than solenoid valves; 5. Electronic adjustment of setpoint and dynamic operating characteristics.  Benefits include simplification, miniaturization, increased reliability, flexibility of operation, and elimination of redundant system hardware.  Commercial applications include commercial satellites/smallsats, ambulatory medical devices, gas chromatographs and other instruments.",

MER's advanced C-C composites will be investigated as bipolar plates to decrease weight, increase mechanical integrity, decrease resistivity and improve the thermal management of the fuel cell at lower cost than conventional carbon.  In addition, MER's cermet composites (TiB(2)/Cu and TiB(2)/Al, etc.) with twice the modulus of steel and half the weight, will be investigated as end plates for the fuel cell to decrease the overall weight and enhance the fuel cell mechanical integrity.  These materials will be combined with advanced fuel cell electrodes to eliminate the humidification requirements.  Near net shape C-C bipolar plates and cermet end plates will be fabricated, characterized, and they will be evaluated in single cell configurations for electrochemical stability, resistivity, and gas diffusion.  A multi-cell stack with the cermet end plate will also be evaluated.  The overall concept will be assessed for both technical performance and cost for further development in Phase II.",

Preliminary results indicate that fullerene hydrides, have a significantly improved weight and possibly volumetric density for hydrogen storage over the best metal hydrides. Preliminary results also indicate that the absorption of hydrogen in fullerenes is associated with low heat generation, and fullerenes reversibly absorb and desorb hydrogen at less than 4 atmosphere pressure. This work will be extended to establish the physical and thermal properties of fullerene hydrides formation. Preliminary engineering system design will be preformed to establish the suitability of the proposed concept to supply hydrogen for advanced fuel cells to power military and commercial vehicles. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Lightweight, high volumetric density, thermally efficient hydrid compounds such as fullerene hydrids are anticipated to have a wide commercial application beyond military application, such as hydrogen external combustion engine, hydrogen purification, and energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Discontinuous aluminum metal matrix composites (AL MMCs) have demonstrated promising behavior for ballistic structural armor applications.  A fine grain matrix, low-cost processing and prevention of agglomeration of the reinforcement is lacking in current processing to produce Al MMCs.  Low-cost processing with extensive flexibility in process control for tailoring reinforcement loading and matrix grain size while producing thicknesses up to but not limited to two-inches of ceramic particle and whisker reinforced Al MMCs is required for structural armor applications.  The proposed processing has already produced over two-inch thick sections of Al MMCs for other applications as well as some ballistic testing.  This processing will be further developed to produce thicknesses of over two-inches with the flexibility to control ceramic particle loading from low to high including gradation and whiskers in the interstices with a fine grained aluminum matrix.  Thick section MMCs will be produced, ballistically tested and further optimized with the delivery of six 12 x 12 x over one-inch thick plates of one or more MMC compositions.",

Evaluations will be performed on a representative T1-6-4 SCS-6, 0 degree fiber orientation MMC material, exhibiting one type of damage accumulation.  The rejuvenation process to be developed and employed in this program will be able to restore the MMC material to a condition equal to its original physical condition.  Control specimens will be used for base line information to measure the effect of the recovery process.  A duplicate test for each base line test will be used for rejuvenation purposes.  MBRC will perform damage accumulation analysis from a fractographic and metallographic stand point and MBRC along with Textron Lycoming will provide the analytical modeling of the damage and recovery process.  MBRC's 35 years experience in materials science and materials testing and Textron Lycoming's knowledge of gas turbine design, will provide the support for a successful program.",

Smooth, ultrahard coatings that have good thermal conductivity and little or no electrical conductivity can protect these surfaces by preventing arc erosion. In this Phase I effort, Materials Modification Inc., (MMI) proposes several different approaches to address this requirement using cubic boron nitride and aluminum nitride coatings over OFHC surfaces. The coatings will be also exposed to elevated temperatures to ascertain their oxidation resistance and characterized extensively using standard optical, SEM/EDAX hardness techniques. After preliminary screening in Phase I, we will proceed in Phase II to deposit coating on arc heater segments for actual testing in an operating system at AEDC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The thrust to develop cleaner burning combusion systems with reduced levels of emissions (NOx and SOx) has led to a renewed interest in the exploration for the use of advanced materials in components such as pistons. Other driving forces are fuel economy, and NVH (noise vibration, and harshness). The first two (emissions and fuel economy) are government mandated while the NVH is a mandate of the marketplace. All of these driving forces and goals will ultimately affect the piston design used in the engine In gasoline engines, as well as natural gas engines, hypereutectic aluminum silicon (>12%) alloyw are normally used due to their excellent wear resistance. However, they have limitations in the overall temperature to which they can be exposed thus resulting in a limitation in the combustion temperatures in the engine. If higher temperatures are desired in future engines, advanced materials will be needed to extend these limits. Carbon-Carbon materials were developed for the aerospace industry and have historically been ignored for large volume commercial applications due to their high costs. However, in the last 5 years, the advent of a number of new processing routes to form carbon fibers has reduced the prices of production significantly and this ha resulted in the engineering viability of commercial products using these materials. C-C composites also exhibit superior mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. In this Phase I effort, MMI will demonstrate the feasibility of producing C-C pistons by developing all the manufacturing sequences necessary for commercial production. This will allow production of pistons for engine bed testing in Phase II.",

Reduced wafer contamination and simpler waste disposal requirements will provide a strong driving force for replacing existing wet photolithographic processes with the new system.  At the completion of this project, a new inorganic resist system utilizing hydrogenated amorphous silicon will be available to replace many of the wet chemical patterning steps used in current microelectronics, printed circuit board, and flat panel display fabrication.  The system uses only silicon and hydrogen, so there is no contamination of silicon wafers and only dry plasma processing is used for deposition and removal of the films.  Patterning of the amorphous silicon through UV enhanced oxidation will allow the use of existing exposure tools, or exposure under a partial pressure of oxygen would allow an all vacuum process.  The Phase I work will provide proof of concept for the use of amorphous silicon as a dry photoresist. Additionally, detailed design and cost estimates will be generated for a prototype PECVD module optimized for the process developed.",

Thus, the composites can be configured for extremely high hydrostatic receiving sensitivity (similar to an end-capped array), low voltage actuation, or air-acoustic operation. The applications for such composites can thus be extended to large area hydrophones or airborne acoustic noise control.

In another, the company has adapted its injection molding process to form extremely fine transducer arrays, suitable for high frequency applications. In this program, MSI plans to utilize these piezoelectric composite manufacturing capabilities to form low electrical impedance 2D arrays for use in 3D ultrasonic imaging.  By multilayering the PZT ceramic elements, the electrical impedance of the small 2D PZT pillars can be drastically reduced, resulting in enhanced signal-to-noise ratio compared to monolithic array elements. The key innovation is the method used to form the multilayer array. In Phase I, MSI will demonstrate that multilayer PZT 2D transducer array structures can be made cost-effectively, and will develop a simple lab- scale demonstration array with interconnects.  In Phase II a working array will be assembled and tested in an underwater 3D imaging demonstration relevant to Navy acoustic imaging needs.",

These films will have important applications in laminates for Multichip Modules (MCM) and other advanced packaging techniques. The unique combination of rigid-rod backbone and amorphous form will result in film properties not possible with existing materials. Poly-X (tm) resins also have very low dielectric constants and moisture uptake. Anticipated Benefits: Development of low coefficient of thermal expansion dielectric films and laminates will enable low cost fabrication of Multichip Modules.",

The proposed system, CHAPS-II, meets the above objective, and provides highly accurate GPS measurements in both jamming and no-jamming test conditions.  Effective error mitigation algorithms and techniques are employed to further improve the navigation accuracy of the reference system while providing the above capability.  A GSPR receiver design is proposed which will operate well both in jamming or no-jamming tests.  The proposed CHAPS-II system meets the size requirement of 1.5 cu.ft. with sufficient margin for future growth.  The Phase I effort will identify the preferred reference system configuration, provide the rationale for the choice and will identify components to replace current flight reference systems. The Phase II effort will complete the CHAPS-II system design, will develop integration drawings and will implement the mitigation algorithm s in Ada programming language.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We proposed to integrate second generation infrared thermography, real time image analysis and patient information stored in a medical database into the risk assessment for breast cancer patients, detection and diagnosis of breast cancer and prognostic determination for breast cancer patients.  Previous attempts to use first generation thermographic instruments showed that the results were applicable to the detection, diagnosis, and the risk assessment of breast cancer.  However, the high false positive rate of approximately 25% for detection of breast cancer with first generation thermography prevented its acceptance by the medical community.  We expect to lower the false positive rate, increase the positive predictive value and increase the negative predictive value of breast thermography by combining second generation infrared thermography, which has greater sensitivity and real time analysis, which improves the specificity.  As second generation thermographic instrumentation is brought into the medical diagnostic arena, there will be the natural expansion of its application to other types of cancer (e.g. melanoma) for risk assessment, detection, diagnosis, and a sa prognostic indicator. Creation of highly portable databases will allow patients to carry their thermographic images and image analysis results with them so that serial analysis (comparison of previous to current thermographic results) can easily be done for detection and monitoring of a wide spectrum of diseases.",

Ethylene Oxide is widely used for this purpose, while the alternate non-chemical (physical) processes of heat and gamma - radiations are expensive and frequently result in unacceptable damage to the product.  The proposed program will provide a proof of principle demonstration of the practicability of using pneumatic transfer of these materials to present them in an efficient manner to low energy electron beams.  These self-shielded energy sources can provide adequate beam power levels to provide very high throughputs.  The present demonstration system will be utilized at under 3 kilowatts output and modest gas flow velocities (30-150 m/minute) with powder loading factors in the air stream of a few percent.  The test will be conducted using both dose and the air stream powder loading factor as independent variables.  The assembly and testing of the self-contained product handling system constitutes a major part of the program effort with the conduct of the experiments (includig microbiological assays) representing a lessor part of the work.  The remainder is in data processing and reporting.

The most widely used conventional treatment technology is carbonadsorption.  However, carbon adsorption produces dilute aqueous waste streams asa secondary waste, is difficult to adapt to particulate-containing streams, andis too expensive to be applied by some industries.  Wet scrubbing the air is alow-cost alternative technology, but it is generally limited to scrubbing withwater because of the expense and difficulty of regenerating non-aqueous scrubbingliquids.  The technology proposed here uses a low volatility organic scrubbingliquid to remove VOCs from the dilute air stream.  The liquid is regenerated bya combined stripper/membrane vapor separation unit.  In Phase I, the technicaland economic feasibility of the scrubbing liquid regeneration step will beevaluated in laboratory tests with an existing stripper/pilot-scale membranesystem.  In Phase II, a scrubber will be added to the system for evaluation ofthe complete process.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We will develop a nonradioactive, noninvasive breath test to predict blood drug levels. We willdevelop a 13C breath test to measure cytochrome P450IIIA enzyme activity. Many drugs, such ascyclosporine, are metabolized by this p450 family. The catalytic activity of p450IIIA will be estimatedfrom the rate at which a patient exhales 13CO2 after receiving an oral dose of [N,N-dimethyl-13C2]-eryt-hromycin. In previous studies, we showed that an intravenous dose of radioactive 14C-erythromycinwould be N-demethylated by P450IIIA enzymes. The production of breath 14CO2 correlated withP450IIIA levels and catalytic activity. Further research showed that the 14C-erythromycin breath testaccurately predicts cyclosporine blood levels in patients receiving different dosages. The activity ofP450IIIA varies ten fold in humans and may account for heterogeneity of cyclosporine dosingrequirements. Knowledge of P450IIIA activity could predict a cyclosporine blood level for a given drugdosage. The clinician will utilize this information to prevent either potentially subtherapeutic orpotentially toxic dosages of cyclosporine to be administered to patients. The correct dosage ofcyclosporine could be achieved in a shorter hospital stay with this breath test compared to the currentmethod of measuring blood levels.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Mortality during broiler growout still averages from 4 to 6% in the US.  Mortality and morbidity are primary sources of economic loss for poultry and livestock producers.  Control of morbidity and mortality has generally been accomplished through the use of vaccines and feed antibiotics.  In spite of these protective measures, livestock producers still suffer losses due to mortality and sub-clinical disease problems.  At least half of broiler mortality is due to unidentified factors.  It is therefore critical that the young chick's immune system has a strong start early in life.  The leucine catabolite Beta-hydroxy-Beta-methyl butyrate (HMB) has been shown to reduce mortality of broiler chickens, most of which was due to an abatement of unidentified early mortality during the first three weeks of age.  The objectives of this project would be to develop the use of HMB as an alternative to conventional drugs to control mortality in broilers.  The proposed study will use in vivo and in vitro techniques to determine if HMB improves immune function in young broiler chicks and thus, reducing unidentified mortality of the broiler chicks.  These studies would establish the basis for Phase II efficacy studies in poultry.",

HOWEVER, 2DSLMS HAVE NOT BEEN WELL DEVELOPED FOR PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS DUE TO A LACK OF HIGH QUALITY NONLINEAR OPTICAL (NLO) MATERIAL, AND INADEQUACIES IN THE DEVICE CONCEPT.  CURRENT 2DSLMS GREATLY LIMIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING.  RESEARCHERS ARE DEVELOPING AN INNOVATIVE, TWO-DIMENSIONAL OPTICALLY ADDRESSED, THRESHOLDING, AND ERASABLE 2DSLM.  THE 2DSLM IS BASED ON A NONLINEAR FABRY-PEROT INTERFEROMETER MODULATOR WITH CAVITY MATERIAL MADE OF BACTERIORHODOPSIN (BR), A NEWLY DEVELOPED NONLINEAR OPTICAL (NLO) PHOTOCHROMIC PROTEIN.  THE DEVICE UTILIZES THE LARGE REFRACTIVE INDEX CHANGE OF BR IN THE FABRY-PEROT CAVITY TO ALTER THE DEVICE OPTICAL TRANSMISSION.  THIS DEVICE HAS EXCELLENT SPATIAL RESOLUTION, HIGH OPTICAL SENSITIVITY, EASY ERASABILITY, SIMPLE ADJUSTABLE THRESHOLDS, RANDOM ADDRESS CAPABILITY, ENORMOUS PIXEL DENSITY, AND HIGH CONTRAST.  THE PROJECT IS A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN THE REAL-TIME, HIGH-SPEED OPTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF PATTERN RECOGNITION, OPTICAL COMPUTING, NEURAL NETWORK, AND NONLINEAR IMAGING PROCESSING.  THE EFFORT CONSISTS OF ANALYTICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL WORK AIMED AT EVALUATING SPATIAL RESOLUTION, SENSITIVITY, WRITE/ERASE CYCLES, AND FABRICATION PROCEDURES OF THE BR-SLM.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         To fully capitalize on the use of focal plane arrays in seekers, unconventional optics with high resolution,, low f/number, low weight and volume are required.  Diffractive optical elements use the diffractive properties of light as opposed to refraction and reflection.  A thin film diffractive optical element which can be placed on any surface, can emulate virtually any optical component leading to considerable weight and size reduction.  MetroLaser has demonstrated that functions such as scanning, zooming, and spectral discrimination are achievable with diffractive optics and has exploited them in related problems.  Two types of diffractive optics, holographic optical elements and binary optical elements are applicable in seekers.  After a master element is constructed, additional replicas can be produced at essentially the raw material cost.  The proposal is to construct, test, and demonstrate a prototype sensor employing diffractive optics that operate in the IR band and that advantageously replace existing seeker optics. The proposal shows that a considerable commercial potential exists for such optics.",

The current method of disposal is to landfill transparencies.  Landfill disposal is becoming increasingly expensive and operationally unacceptable for materials that potentially are recyclable.  These transparencies represent a highly valuable recycling stream which is currently being landfilled by the USAF at the rate of approximately thirty tons per year.  Under the proposed program METSS will demonstrate the technical feasibility of using supercritical carbon dioxide fluid extraction (SFE) of high grade polycarbonate resins from unserviceable aircraft canopies and windshields to produce a high quality and valuable recycled transparent polycarbonate resin stream.  SFE is well suited for this application based on its environmentally benign operating conditions, its proven ability to selectively extract target organic materials, and a processing method which does not require expensive and labor intensive material separation, cleaning or difficult mechanical regrinding.",

A domain engineering inter- face will provide an open architecture to all supported DSPs configured in a variety of architectures. The environment will provide tools for PGM specification of applications using application domain primitives and selection/specification of a target signal processor architecture. Environment tools will optimize the appli- cation for the specified architecture and automatically generate executable appli- cation code. Run-time support will provide efficient, real-time application execution. Command program and execution monitor run-time interfaces will be supported. A GUI command interface will support interactive graph control as an alternative to command programs. The execution monitor will provide a \"virtual oscilloscope\" capability to interact with application data. Exporting data to and importing data to/from other tools will support interactive use of PGM and other analysis and display tools. The PGM workstation environment will be portable to workstations and PCs with Unix support. Translation support for new DSPs is easily added to the environment. Run-time support is readily ported to new architectures. The environment will be implemented reusing software objects from other PGM efforts to maximize leverage of SBIR funds and minimize technical risk.",

Nearly all subunit vaccine studieshave used the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) as the immunogen with only modest success.The identification of alternate surface proteins to test as vaccine candidates could significantly hastenthe development of an effective vaccine. MicroCarb has developed a novel approach for identifying keysurface adhesion proteins using various cell surface receptors. This approach was used with chlamydiato demonstrate specific binding of chlamydia to a distinctive cell membrane receptor component. Usingthis component as an affinity binding substrate, a novel membrane-associated protein, distinct frompreviously characterized chlamydial proteins, has been identified which binds this receptor. Theproposed research will characterize this novel membrane protein with antisera generated againstchlamydial membrane surface proteins of similar size. The antisera will be used to facilitate cloning ofthe gene encoding the receptor binding protein from a Chlamydia traehomatis gene bank generated inan E. coli expression system. Immunoreactive clones will be evaluated for expression of the novelreceptor- binding protein and for their ability to absorb antibody that inhibits receptor binding and/orinfectivity by C. traehomatis in vitro. Identification of a novel adhesion will permit evaluation of thisprotein as a subunit vaccine in a preclinical phase II application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In this proposal, new fabrication techniques for high density 2D medical ultrasound arrays will be developed.  These techniques will allow for the construction of 10 to 50 MHz arrays with very high element counts, complex 2D geometries, and much smaller structures than can be effectively fabricated today using traditional dicing saw techniques. The proposed fabrication method represents a significant departure from traditional approaches and incorporates new micromachining and interconnection technologies to allow for the creation of complex geometries and dense interconnection to passive or active substrates. This technology will lead to significant improvements in invasive or minimally invasive ultrasound arrays where the performance to date has been substandard due to manufacturing processes which allow for only low element counts and limited feature delineation. During Phase I of the proposed research, a 10 x 10 (100 element), 2D 10 MHz array will be designed, fabricated and characterized. This array will have kerf widths of less than 10 micons.

        "abstract": "Abstract         We will develop a new kind of pump for biomedicine. The pump is a small, piezoelectric device that has no conventional moving parts and is only a few mm in overall size. Digital electrical pulses produce individual pumping \"strokes,\" and the pump can be operated at up to 20,000 hz. In our prototype, each pulse delivers approximately 51 pl of fluid; modeling studies indicate that larger and smaller volumes can be produced. The combination of miniature size, precise volumetric control, and digital operation make the piezoelectric pump an attractive candidate for many biomedical applications. Pilot studies indicate that the pumps will work in the laboratory, to pump fluids into cells or tissues, and would also work after implantation into body cavities, to pump fluids directly into tissues or organs. The pump design has evolved from the ink-jet technology utilized at MicroFab. These jets consist of an inner glass capillary tube with a precision-formed orifice surrounded by a piezoelectric outer wall that contracts when activated electronically. The present work will (i) characterize the viscous hydrodynamic behavior that underlies the pumping in our devices, (ii) determine optimum pump shapes and surfaces for pumping, and (iii) build and evaluate prototype pumps.",

Specifically, we will apply ink-jet printing technology to form and place microscopic droplets of passive and active optical materials, such as uv-cured resins and sol-gel glasses, in order to construct micro-optical elements and structures of high scientific, commerical, and defense department interest. Ink-jet technologies reliably and repeatably produce and place droplets 20-150um in diameter. Applications of this approach which we will evaluate include the delivery of droplets of these materials directly onto the tips of optical fibers and the output facets of diode lasers to alter and improve their optical properties; and the delivery of droplets onto substrates to form structures such as lenslet arrays, waveguides and couplers for potential use in optical integrated circuits. Future (Phase II and III) applications to be investigated include: optical switching and routing components; novel micro-lasers for high spectral purity or femtosecond applications; and optical sensors. Anticipated Benefits: This research will lead to significant cost reductions in the manufacture of passive and active optical elements.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The collection of sufficient quantities of truly representative ambient samples (e.g., air, water) for analysis is a serious problem with any mobile air sampling and monitoring system. There are several ways this problem can be addressed. The approach proposed in tihs SBIR is twofold. First, a chemical detector with very high sensitivity and selectivity will be designed to reduce the volume of sample required. Second, the size, volume, cost, and power consumption will be reduced to the point where it will be feasible to deploy an array of detectors throughouth an area to assure more representative sampling. The chemical detectors will be capable of coninous, automatic, remote operation and will interface with a control/data acquisition network via hardwire or RF communication links. The new, high performance chemical detector will be based on solid state surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, which are very small, low cost, rugged, low power, and highly sensitive chamical detectors. The practical ilimitation of present SAW sensors is their limited chemical sslectivity. The technical approach of Phase I, therefore, will be make a major improvement in selectivity, specifically by placing a miniature GC column ahead of a muliple SAW sensor array. It is projected that the performance of such a SAW Array/GC unit will approach that of a mass spectrometer, but at a fraction of the size, cost, and complexity. The projected SAW/GC system will also be evaluated for minimum size, weight, cost, complexity, maintenance, and power consumption, as well as transportability. Anticipated Benefits: The new SAW Array/GC is designed specifically to meet US requirements for a small, high performance, highly portable, automatic chemical monitor that can be readily deployed anywhere in the world. However, because of it's unique performance capablities and many palnned user options it is also expected to meet many industrial and environmental chemical detection/monitoring requirements. The SAW Array/GC chemical monitor is thus expected to have a significant commercial market.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Vibration suppression/rejection is important for many space system attitude controls. Structural vibration of solar arrays and instrumentation booms can significantly degrade the performance of attitude control systems and reduce the accuracy of scientific instrumentations. In establishing effective attitude control, the effect of disturbance loads due to the structural vibration must be measured. An innovative approach to measuring the structural response is the use of area averaging sensors. Spatially distributed sensors constructed from an intelligent polymer film represent a viable, practical alternative for obtaining measurements for the control purpose. These sensors are lightweight, durable, highly sensitive, and they can also be shaped to provide innovative spatial filtering not obtainable with conventional sensors. This Phase I proposal will fully innovate and develop these attractive properties of area averaging sensors and apply these sensors to attitude control of space system with flexible solar arrays and instrumentation booms. Phase II will design (in detail), fabricate and test a prototype of the proposed sensor. Inexpensive area averaging sensors are ideal for a number of commercial applications, including high speed disk-head control, gust alleviation, flutter suppression, vibration suppression/isolation, and helicopter higher harmonic control. Establishing area averaging sensors as a practical and proven engineering solution would help reduce design costs while enabling higher performance.",

Two methods of exciting the elements will be investigated:  1) Simultaneously excite all elements of the array to produce a steerable plane wave illumination of the antenna under test, 2) Excite only one element at a time which produces spherical wave illumination on the antenna under test.  Also two different types of arrays and feed networks will be investigated during Phase I of this program:  1) microstrip fed slots and 2) electrically short dipole elements fed by balanced two-wire feed lines.  The feed lines are intentionally mismatched to the radiating elements such that the RF coupler does not disrupt externally impressed incident fields.

The antenna technology proposed has been proven to work for Low Observable (LO) aircraft applications.  The proposed utilization for chamber operation will involve design simplification and low cost construction.  Beam width and beam direction are readily controlled since the antenna is an array.  Costs can be controlled by using routine printed circuit etching technology to produce repeatable, accurate feed network on a single layer.  Beam control can be achieved by an inexpensive switch network on each array column or row by a space feed.  The low RCS aspects of the antenna design are achieved by carefully controlling array element input impedance for a wide range of scan angles by using compensating dielectric layers.  Potential feed network returns are controlled by including integral hybrids in the etched as part of the feed network.  both structural and antenna mode scattering are controlled by this array configuration.  Array edges must be carefully blended into the surrounding chamber absorber.  This concept has been proven to exhibit low RCS and dependable antenna performance over a 4:1 bandwidth.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The efficiency, maintenance cost, and service life of off-highway vehicles can be drastically improved with the development of a heat exchanger precleaner. Development challenges include ease of integration with present and new vehicles, the device compact size, high contaminates removal efficiency, low initial and maintenance cost, and high reliability. The objective of Phase I of this project is to demonstrate the innovative applicatin of a filterless heat exchanger precleaner for use by military and commercial vehicles. This method relies on the use of guide vanes to impart a swirling motion ot the air for subsequent separation of the contaminates. A rapid swirling motion of the air allows quick and efficient removal of dust and fluids from the air with a small drop in pressure. Guide vanes can be arranged in a matrix and fabricated using injection molding processes to save space and reduce fabrication cost. The proposed method also offers high reliability, low maintenance cost, and easy integration with present and future vehicles. The Phase I project will be a key stop in demonstrating the concpet of the guide vane approach and its comparison with the other precleaner approaches. Specifically, the Phase I project will investigate the feasibility and compare the guide vane approach by demonstrating its superior efficiency, compact size, fabrication methods, and integration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         It has been shown that continuous monitoring of brain function can significantly improve the outcome of certain critical care patients (e. g. head trauma, coma, post op cardiac, etc.). Accordingly, a new generation of easy-to-use, bedside brain monitors is now being developed and marketed by a number of leading patient care companies (e. g. Hewlett-Packard and others). With the equipment now available, there presents a growing need to train nurses in the fundamentals of continuous brain monitoring, particularly electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. We will develop and evaluate a unique, computer-based interactive training system for teaching brain monitoring. The goal is to teach nurses to recognize basic changes in the EEG which, if brought to the attention of physicians, could improve patient outcome. The system is based on a novel electronic EEG generator developed by the company. The generator will be interfaced to a personal computer so that EEG waveforms can be synchronized with an interactive multi-media course on the computer. The course will be developed from both new material and from material in an existing neuromonitoring course. The training system will be evaluated by critical care nurses at a local university hospital.",

By reducing the time of each conformational study by better than an order of magnitude, many more molecules may be screened in a given period of time, and more complete studies can be made correlating the discrete chemical transformations with pharmacologic data. This will result in a speed up in the formulation of a sound chemical rationale for the biochemical behavior of these drugs. Both the information gathered and the software methodologies developed will be of great scientific and commercial interest. There are currently no commercial molecular mechanics simulation packages that have the unique combination of speed, flexibility, and scaleability that these reduced variable algorithms possess. The ability to study more realistic systems will lead to an enhanced ability to design better anticancer drugs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Phase I SBIR project will demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative computational tool for the development of new materials. It has always been the goal of computational chemistry to predict the formation, behavior and properties of a molecule before it is synthesized in the laboratory.  While considerable progress has been made, severe computational limitations still inhibit a global solution approach.  At one extreme, the quantum codes are needed to predict electronic and optical properties; at the other, molecular mechanics tools are necessary to determine thermal and mechanical characteristics.  As long as these extremes are largely uncoupled, the codes are generally useful.   Where localized quantum effects drive major macromolecular conformation changes, as in photon absorption by bacteriorhodopsin, conventional codes become inadequate.  Recent algorithmic developments by Moldyn, based on aggregation approaches, will however, respond to these needs.  Multigranularity is already inherent in aggregation, and the primary task is to include the quantum capability in that formalism.  In Phase I, the method will be demonstrated using existing codes - the quantum and atomistic capabilities in CHARMM combined with the aggregation approaches within MBO(N)D.  Bacteriorhodopsin will be the test example.  In Phase II, the prototype of an end-to-end multigranular code will be assembled.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Focal plane arrays (FPAs) are one of the most critical and expensive components in infrared imaging equipment, such as nigh vision, security and surveillance systems.  In the device manufacturing processes, at present, it is not possible to determine if the final product is successful until all steps and materials have been incorporated.  Since this entire manufacturing process can take up to 12 weeks to complete, much time and effort is spent on components which may ultimately prove to be defective.  Current defect rates are in the order of 80% and are attributed to defective FPA chips/die.  As a consequence, the availability of fully functional FPA modules is limited, and the price of those produced is unacceptably high.  The Hall effect technique, particularly in conjunction with the van der Pauw theorem, is the most frequently used method of screening chips.  In this technique at least four electrical ohmic contacts must be made to the semiconductor.  This technique is labor intensive and frequently causes mechanical and electrical problems that result in inaccurate and non-repeatable results or damage. Furthermore, the measurement of carrier concentration as a function of position on the slice (mapping) is impossible since the Hall technique provides only the average value of the carrier concentration for area enclosed by the electrical contacts.  For detector arrays, carrier concentration uniformity or doping homogeneity is necessary for uniform array operations.  Any nonuniformity in the starting material would show up as a nonuniformity in the detectivity of each pixel in the detector array.  The approach described in this proposal requires no physical contacts, is not labor intensive and can map electronic properties, such as carrier concentration and mobility, of a chip with high spatial resolution thereby identifying small areas of electronic nonuniformity that could not otherwise be found by conventional screening methods.  This is accomplished by utilizing the Faraday rotation effect.",

The program addresses the need to find new and entertainingways of presenting basic neuroscience information to young children. The primary rationale for theabsence of neuroscience from elementary school education is that it's too abstract, complicated, andspecialized as a science to be taught to young children. The central component of the program is astory-based CD-ROM game that takes the participant on a fantasy voyage through inner space to explorethe brain. In Phase I a prototype program will be developed and evaluated. In Phase II the story-basedgame will be completed and field tested. The final program will be marketed as both a consumer productand as a supplemental learning program for the target age group. The supplemental version will bemarketed to elementary and middle schools and will include teacher materials and a multimediapresentation program that can be used to prepare reports, stories, and other activities.",

The project will utilize chemical vapor conversion processes in combination with a novel electromagnetic spreading technique for the precursor carbon yarns developed by MSNW, Inc. which should facilitate the uniform surface conversion of each filament of the precursor multifilament tow. The ultimate objective of the conversion process is the production of low cost, small diameter \"psuedo-SiC\" fibers for use in high temperature ceramic matrix composites. Commercial carbon fibers in multifilament yarns will be converted to SiC at elevated temperatures in an atmosphere of SiCl4, HC1, and H2. The kinetics of the conversion process will be studied as a function of temperature and the addition of boron to the system to modify the diffusional conversion mechanism. The morphologies, microstructures, and tensile properties of the resulting fibers will be determined. Anticipated Benefits: Potential applications for such fibers are reinforcements for high temperature composites for use in advanced defense and aerospace systems. Commercial applications include heat exchangers, vehicular and industrial turbine engines, and fusion energy conversion devices.",

The Phase I objectives are to (1) assess and define a solution for the monopulse tracking problem, (2) assess and define a solution for output data management, (3) specify and define an improved user's guide and on-line support, and (4) establish the commercialization approach.  Through this effort, AECM will obtain the ability to properly and accurately simulate the monopulse tracking function at the level of precision necessary for effective electronic protection assessments.  AECM will also become a much more effective tool through enhanced output data organization and user interfacing.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The proposed work involves assessment of the feasibility of removal of large, concentrated heat fluxes from multi-chip circuit boards in high performance aircraft by means of liquid jet impingement cooling with subcooled change of phase. Previous studies have shown that, unlike many other types of liquid immersion concepts, the thermal performance of the proposed concept is more sensitive to coolant velocity than to flow rate. Thus, performance can be greatly enhanced by reducing jet width (in order to increase jet velocity) without increasing the coolant flow rate. Key features of the proposed jet impingement concept are its ultra high heat dissipation capabilities, up to 660 Watts per device using FC-72, small pressure drop and simplicity of design and fabrication. The key objectives of the proposed project are disigning a single multi-jet manifolding plate which can be accommodated within the geometrical constraints of avionics cooling modules, modeling the development of vapor bubbles on the device surface (to establish design guidelines for preventing dryout and ensuring complete condensation of the bubbles prior to exiting the module), and designing the module itself, maximizing the use of commercially available hardware.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This project will develop a new class of affordable advanced airborne sensors based on innovative signal processing techniques applied to wideband radar and SAR imaging. As a case study, we consider the problem of classification and localization of buried objects such as metallic and non-metallic mines. However, this work is broadly applicable and represents an important step towards developing a suite of new avionic sensors to perform (eventually) long-distance surgical mapping of buried assets. This project will develop the requisite algorithms and demonstrate their performance with Navy supplied data. As an option, we will provide a prototype system design that can be built and tested in Phase II. Underscoring this effort are advanced high-order signal processing (HOSP) methods which are capable of increasing signal-to-noise/clutter ratios and enhancing SAR resolution, thus improving detection and localization of targets-of-interest. Recent results on material characterization obtained by MultiSpec using HOSP and ultra-wideband radar, will be adapted to this application framework. The Phase I objectives of this project are: (1) development of HOSP-based algorithms for SAR subsurface imaging and demonstration of enhanced performance in detection, and localization of closely spaced buried mines using synthetic data; (2) demonstration of the efficacy of these techniques with Navy-supplied data; (3) exploration of material characterization capabilities of these HOSP-based radar and SAR techniques; (4) prototype system design for implementation in Phase II (option).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Ultra-Wideband (UWB) signals, much like conventional spread spectrum waveforms, minimize intercepts from unintended receivers by generating negligible amounts of energy within the intercept receiver's acquisition bandwidth. Unlike spread spectrum, UWB spread bandwidth is generated directly, not by modulation with a spreading sequence. UWB is essentially a time-domain concept in which an extremely short pulse generates an extremely wide bandwidth signal because of the Fourier transform relationship between time and frequency. MSSI, teamed with ANRO, has recently completed a very successful SBIR Phase I program where feasibility was demonstrated for a covert 1 Mb/s UWB data link that could be combined with an altimeter for a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) application. It was shown that the simplicity of a UWB avionics package permits the development of a singel, common module capable of performing communciations, altimeter, obstacle avoidance, data link and transponder position/recovery functions, all at low cost and system complexity. Advances in imulse, or UWB technology, made by MSSI and ANRO over the past 10 years now provide a firm foundation for further system application development, primarily extending data rates to 100 Mb/s and apparent center frequency to 30 GHz. Anticipated Benefits: UWB technology offers LPI/LPD performance, but at significant cost and reliability advantages to conventional systems. Due to its digital nature, UWB systems are small, lighweight, inexpensive, extremely accurate, and very reliable. Application areas include altimetry, obstacle avoidance radar, data links (military and commercial), and transponder/position recovery.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         There is an increasing need for an innovative technology for low cost recovery and recycling of heavy metals found in industrial wastewater streams.  Target heavy metals include elements such as chromium, nickel, cadmium, lead, copper, and zinc.  Existing wastewater treatment technologies such as bioremediation can neither biodegrade heavy metals, nor can they decontaminate them. Other conventional alternatives such as ion-exchange and precipitation are too expensive to be commercially viable and they create another hazardous waste.  This program seeks to explore, develop and commercialize an alternative technology with the potential of profitably recovering and recycling heavy metals.  The proposed technology is based on photocatalyzed redox recovery of metals over nanosized catalysts.  The proposed technology has many desirable features:  photoreduction on nanocatalysts is fast and works with solar energy; the use of nanocatalysts significantly enhances the process efficiency; the nanocatalysts can also simultaneously and completely mineralize organic and non-metallic pollutants that may be present in the wastewater (broadband treatment agent).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Global production and use of ceramic capacitors exceeds several hundred million units per day. With the projected growth in demand for more demanding electronic products, electronic vehicles and related technologies, the need for more reliable, higher energy density, higher power density, higher breakdown strength, efficient ceramic capacitors can not be overstated. Multilayered ceramic capacitors have the potential of meeting these needs. However, their performance is limited by the fact that the thickness of each layer cannot be lowered below about 5-10u as the multilayered structure is presently produced from micron-sized ceramic powders. Phase I seeks to explore and demonstrate that this problem may be overcome with the use of nano-powders (particle size 1 to 100 nanometers) of ceramics. Nano-powders can yield dielectric thickness that are more than an order of magnitude lower than the best achievable today, yet enhance the breakdown stress, the mechanical and thermal robustness. The projected energy density of nanoceramics-based multilayered capacitor is 5-15 J/cc which is more than 10 fold higher than the best conventional multilayered ceramic capacitors. Phase I will establish the proof-of-concept, while Phase II will seek to optimize, produce and field test prototype nanostructured capacitors. The multilayered capacitors have applications in portable energy sources, pulsed power armament, electronic components used by the BMDO. The technology has dual-use applications in electric and hybrid electric vehicles, vehicle start up circuits and portable energy components.",

The new probes will combine the high electron density, ease of visualization and range of sizes available with colloidal gold probes with the non-aggregation, high penetrating ability and sensitivities of smaller gold cluster immunoprobes. Methods are proposed for the chemically controlled growth of large bimetallic cluster complexes, colloids by catalytic metal deposition, ligand capping, and for the preparation of heavy atom cluster complexes and colloids within the hollow protein apoferritin. Syntheses are proposed for cage molecules with internal diameters from 5 nm to 20 nm, constructed using large gold cluster complexes, rigid rod supports and cross-linked flat plates. This unprecedented new class of large inclusion compounds with novel physical and chemical properties will be precursors to new imaging reagents, drug delivery systems and materials.",

Although plastics constitute only about 9% by weightof municipal solid waste, they occupy approximately 1/4 the volume of the wastestream.  A particular increasing problem for the recycling of PET is the growthin the use of very lightly tinted PET bottles, particularly light blue tintedbottles for bottling of drinking water and household liquids.  Existing automatedprocesses for sorting bottles by color are unable to recognize the light bluetint and generally direct these bottles into the clear PET product, whichconstitutes about 80% of recycled PET and is the highest valued of the PETrecycled products, resulting in a contamination of the product resin.  Thetechnical objective of the Phase I proposed research is to establish feasibilityfor development of an automated high speed sorting system for sorting lightlytinted plastic bottles from clear plastic bottles.",

Variants may provide affordable monitors for commercial environmental applications.  The technical objective is to formulate a design concept and demonstrate feasiblity of an air-deployed expendable multiparameter environmental probe.  The program goal is to develop a system to obtain real tiem, environmental data in littoral ocean areas to optimize the deployment of acoustic and nonacoustic sensors and systems for Naval or commercial applications.  Measurable parameters include; temperature profile, ambient noise and directionality, current velocity, water turbidity, salinity, ocean depth, acoustic bottom properties, transmission loss, and wave height, period and direction.  Sensor characteristics to be considered are sensitivity, calibration, expendable, compact, light weight and low cost.  Sensing techniques applying micromachine, fiber optics, microchip and electro-optic technologies will be investigated and evaluated.  A system design concept providing flexibility through modular packaging, method of deployment, autonomous operation, and data storage, processing and monitoring is proposed.  This sytem approach will provide a multipurpose capability for littoral/shallow water measurements, deep water measurements, drug enforcement operations and industrial control and enforcement operations.",

These small antennas have correspondingly small radar cross sections (RCS) that can all but be eliminated on demand by making the radiating element lossy. In the present Phase I feasibility study, we will undertake two innovative switching approaches that can deactivate the antenna element within a few microseconds involving a relatively mature silicon on sapphire (SOS) technology. The approach will require HTS film deposition, design, fabrication and testing of the switch using a discrete MOS device mounted on a coplanar HTS line deposited on sapphire substrates. We will investigate processing techniques in Phase I. Fabrication of complete antenna systems will be undertaken in Phase II efforts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         There is a significant market for tunable filters with potentially large defense and commercial applications.  The role of high temperature superconducting (HTS) materials for the fabrication of high performance microwave devices is getting increased recognition.  The realization of tunable high performance HTS microwave devices could open up potential markets in the satellite and mobile communications field.  Tunable HTS devices, either for changing the operating frequency of a device or for introducing a desired delay, will constitute a class of desirable devices for the communications industry.  In Phase I, we propose a feasibility study for the construction of a tunable filter utilizing two approaches.  The first approach will utilize a hetero-structure consisting of a superconductor filter in conjunction with a voltage tunable dielectric layer.  The second approach will utilize a voltage tunable diode capacitor in conjunction with a superconducting resonator.  In both approaches the challenge will be to preserve the high Q values obtained using HTS resonators and yet achieve a high degree of tunability for reasonable voltage levels.  The preferred approach will be pursued in the Phase II of the proposal to develop advanced tunable filters.",

It is essentially' a \"talking map\" that guides the traveler to his/her destination whilekeeping track of their location.

The aid is portable and worn like a \"walkman\" cassette player, it hasbeen designed for minimum cost without sacrificing functionality. Unlike systems that use GPS forpositioning information, position tracking is by a stand-alone module that uses electronic compass andinertial sensors. This avoids the expense and signal reception problems associated with navigation bysatellite or radio beacon. Phase I specific aims include a feasibility demonstration of automated positiontracking and route guidance for both indoor and outdoor routes. An additional aim is to demonstrate thatcompilation of route instructions can be achieved with modest investment. Pilot tests and a focus group,with blind subjects, will be used to optimize the prototype design. A formal evaluation, in which tenblind subjects travel an unfamiliar route using the prototype aid, will constitute a feasibility demonstra-tion.",

The simulation tool will allow biologists to design models of proteinfamilies, compute multiple alignments, perform simulations of protein interactions, analyze DNA (or RNA)sequences, etc. The methodology consists in utilizing recent progress in machine learning algorithmsto extract pertinent information from biological data. The interest of this approach stems from therichness and availability of sequence data bases and from the lack of complete theories covering all theunderlying biological mechanisms. Specifically, we use learning systems such as Neural Networks orHidden Markov Models (HMMs) to parse DNA sequences and to construct models of protein familieswith clear medical interest. These families include immunoglobulins, kinases (involved in the regulationof basic cellular processes), G-coupled receptors (involved in the transduction of signals carried byhormones and neurotransmitters), growth factors, and several retroviral proteins (such as HIV membraneproteins). These models provide new solutions for several computational problems such as multiplesequence alignments, motif detections, data base searches, protein classifications and genome parsing.Direct commercial applications of such software tools are immediate in biological laboratories and biotechindustries.",

CRF also coordinates theendocrine, behavioral and autonomic responses to stress. Considerable evidence exists from studies ofcerebrospinal fluid, postmortem tissue receptor measurements, and CRF stimulation tests to support thehypothesis that CRF is hypersecreted in clinically depressed patients. There is also evidence for aninvolvement of CRF in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and in the mechanism of action ofbenzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics. We have developed proprietary small moleculeCRF-receptor antagonists. This research will sytematically delineate the important structuralcharacteristics of these molecules which are responsible for binding to the CRF receptor, and to discoveradditional derivatives. Combinatorial libraries of small molecule analogues will be prepared andinvestigated for their in vitro potency at the human CRF-receptor. The recent cloning of the human CRFreceptor allows for novel biological assay formats to be developed which will greatly enhance theidentification of novel, small molecule orally active drugs for the treatment of depression and anxietydisorders.",

Unfortprofessionals often know little about the normal menopause transition and may not be up-to-date on thormone therapy. Further, at a recent NIH-sponsored conference on menopause (March 1993), one of therecommendations was that health professionals need to be provide with the skills to help counsel womwomen in decision making about menopause management.

This proposal details the development of a plan that describes the availability of \"all source\" distributed \"real time\" situational awareness information suitable for on-board, inflight use; how best to collect, process and prepare the data for transmission; and receive and display it for use by the crew of the aircraft. This plan will be the Phase I Report, detailing the outcome and evaluation of the end-to-end feasibility demonstration. Phase II of this topic will carry Phase I results over into a beta test effort to be completed prior to bringing this concept to enterprise in Phase III. Anticipated Benefits: Benefits to the nation's tranportation system will be an improved Air Traffic Control Information system that will contribute to safer and more efficient use of airspace. The commercial application is to develop low cost, high quality, reliable data service equipment and economically viable information services to market to aeronautical users and possibly the government to help overcome problems and limitations of the current system",

The intensified field of view is 100 degrees horizontal by 40 degrees vertical.  Peripheral field of view is practically unobstructed and provides up-look capability.  Long eye relief provides for eye glasses clearance.  This night vision visor is a self contained unit with low profile and close center of gravity that improves safety and comfort of the user, especially in high gravity situations.  The well balanced helmet system will reduce possibility of neck injury and the integral visor will protect the users eyes against the wind and blowing debris and fragments during ejection.  Because the system is configured on the visor, it is easily attachable to many military and law enforcement helmets as well as strap supported head mounts.  Extremely wide intensified image improves safety compared to the existing narrow field of view systems.  The resolution of intensified channels will match or exceed any existing military night vision systems.",

Existing devices used clinically (ECMO and centrifugalpumps) are too large relative to the size of the patient. The specific aims of this program focus ondemonstration of a new rotary pump intended solely for these special young patients. Our latestcreation is a very small, inexpensive centrifugal blood pump for adult cardiopulmonary bypassprocedures. Extensive in vitro testing verifies that this pump is equivalent in flow performance andhemolysis generation to existing centrifugal devices. Preliminary studies show that the Nimbus pumpadapts readily to a neonatal/pediatric version. The key innovation is that the resulting pump size (15 ccpriming volume) is 1/5 to 1/3 that of existing centrifugal pumps. This study will evaluate this pumpconcept through in vitro testing of flow performance, hemolysis generation, and shaft seal integrity. Invivo tests, to be performed at the University of Pittsburgh, are intended to demonstrate thehemodynamic performance, biocompatibility and general suitability of this pump for neonatal/pediatricapplications. A Phase II study would involve longer in vivo trials and development of the pump and itscontrol as a clinical product.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Nitrate contamination of water is a national problem with direct impact on farmers and rural communities.  High nitrate content in potable and animal feed water affects quality of life for humans and threatens productivity from livestock.  Existing nitrate determination methods have a number of drawbacks:  1) lack of sensitivity, 2) inclusion of toxic reagents, and/or 3) difficulty of interpretation.  We propose to develop an easy-to-use, accurate, and environmentally safe nitrate test kit based on the enzyme nitrate reductase isolated from corn leaves.  The kit will be designed for home and farm use.  Technical challenges in kit development are: 1) formulation of an enzyme-based kit for home use; and 2) simplifying evaluation of test results.  Our objectives are to assemble an effective and easy-to-use nitrate test kit and to study new ways to quantify nitrate tests results without expensive or complicated devices.  NECi has a significant competitive advantage in our proprietary technique for purifying nitrate reductase in a stable form.  Our long term goals are the development of enzyme-based nitrate sensors and an enzyme nitrate elimination system for removal of nitrate at the tap.  The nitrate test kit is the first step toward these goals.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Wireless communications with RFID tags is used for numerous tracking and identification purposes, with many new applications on the horizon. Unfortunately, low cost tages are handicapped by read-only capabilities. This limits their potential applications base, particularly in private/secure communications areas, where the ability to periodically rewrite a security code is desirable. Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) is the ideal Read/Write memory for inclusion on RFID tags because it requires a lower write energy than any other nonvolatile memory technology. This allows energy from the RF transmission to be used for writing, as well as reading the memory cells. In addition, the magnetic materials used in the MRAM memory cells are available during routine inductor (antennae), obviating the need for an add-on device, and reducing RFID tag cost. This proposed work will result in the fabrication of a high quality on chip inductor, fabrication of low energy MRAM memory cells, design of a low cost, writeable RFID tag using the inductor and the MRAM memory cells, and design of an RFID Reader/Writer for integating the tag information into a wireline communications network. Anticipated Benefits: Extremely broad applications base includes military personnel and equipment ID tags, updateable medical record tags, Intelligent Vehicle Highway System (IVHS) communication interfaces, implantable medical devices, retail trade tracking and anti-theft devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Giant Magnetoresistive Ratio (GMR) materials will be used to model, specify, and design monolithic magnetic field sensors for detecting motion of ferromagnetic bodies and low magnetic fields. Magnetic fields in the 10-8 to 10 gauss are of primary interest. Three kinds of GMR multilayers will be examined: 1) antiferromagnetic-coupled multilayers, 2) spin-valve or symmetrical spin-valve multilayers which use \"pinning\", and 3) unpinned magnetic layers sandwiching a conducting interlayer. Four sensor configurations will be examined: 1) shield/flux concentrators with no bias, 2) an on-chip permanent magnet bias, 3) an on-chip integrated electromagnetic circuit bias, and 4) a self-biasing technique. In Phase I modeling based on materials measurements will be used to select the best GMR multilayer structure and the best sensor configuration. Also in Phase I, development models of this sensor with discrete signal conditioning electronics will be characterized by at least one government laboratory and by two companies who have expressed interest in the military applications of these sensors. In Phase II monolithic prototype sensors with integrated circuit underlayers will be designed, fabricated, and characterized in collaboration with commercial and government laboratories in anticipation of transfer to production.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Magnetic field sensors are currently in widespread use in military, industrial, and automotive applications. They are currently used in automobile distributors and anti-skid braking systems, and are proposed for vehicle location (wheel sensor) in IVHS systems. The utility and performance of these sensors is critically dependent on magnetic field sensitivity. This development applies Giant Magneto-resistance Ratio (GMR) materials (which were initially developed for radiation hard memories) to magentic field sensors for use in vehicles and for vehicle sensing. These materials have magnetoresistances of three to 30 times the magnetoresistances of common materials used today. A sensor suitable for use in IVHS and anti-skid brakes will be used as an initial focus for Phase I. Prototype GMR sensors will be designed, fabricated, and demonstrated in Phase I. Wheatstone bridge designs using GMR materials and will operate from -40 C to +200 C, and give an unamplified signal of 10% of the power supply voltage. Phase II will extend the field range down to 10-3 Oe using low saturation field GMR materials and on-chip signal conditioning electronics. Other applications include position sensing (when used with a permanent magent), current sensing (when used with a current strap), and magentic body sensing (distortion of the Earth's magnetic field). Military, industrial, and automotive applications are numerous. Anticipated Benefits: Greatly improved accuracy and sensitivity of magentic field sensors for collision avoidance and traffic monitoring. Generic low cost position and current sensors for automotive, production, and industrial applications. Military applications include vehicles and mines.",

A holographic coating can be fabricated to be narrow bandwidth (5-50 nm) or extremely broadband. Used in conjunction with conventional antireflection coatings a surface may be made virtually reflection free. Broadband antireflection coatings currently do not exist and are a major priority for manufacturers such as Libby-Owens-Ford (LOF). This is a new technology addressing an old problem. This technology is applicable to literally dozens of commercial applications. Anywhere unwanted reflection exists a simple coating to reduce or eliminate that reflection is appropriate. Applications include: computer monitors or television screens, framed pictures, solar concentrators and collectors, windows of all kinds, solar cells, focal plane systems, etc.",

With computer hardware becoming faster with each successive generation, more technically complex problems are being solved in software.  The growth in complexity and size of these software systems have led to problems in testing and manageability of the software.  Visual programming provides a way to reduce the complexity of software.  Visual programming reduces the size of a software system from millions of lines of code to tens of thousands of visual elements.  It does this by encapsulating primitive functionality of code within graphical objects and allows the programmer position the icon, tying each programming icon together with a specified interface.  By using an icon-driven, graphical drag-and-drop metaphor popularized by some of the current visual programming tools, the software development environment will be usable by nonprogrammers. To provide flexibility and expressiveness, the development environment will be built on top of a flexible scaffolding allowing the software designer to add or replace items within this scaffolding.  This is accomplished by using a state-of-the-art programming metaphor called component programming.",

The innovations we propose willsubstantially improve microchannel plates (MCPs) as detectors of high mass biomolecular ions. This willbe accomplished through implementation of three separate developments: (1) reducing the MCP surfacework function, to increase ion-electron and ion-ion conversion yields leading to improved signal-to-noiseratios (2) enhancing the grazing incidence geometry for incident primary ions through use of a novelsquare channel geometry, also resulting in increased ion-electron and ion-ion yields: and (3) substantiallyimproving MCP detector dynamic range, which has recently been a limiting factor in analyzing heavierbiomolecules in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI). Any one of these improvementswould be considered a worthy incremental enhancement in MCP performance. We will implement allthree simultaneously in the same MCP detector; the result would be a radical departure in theperformance of high mass ion detectors. If this is done, MCP detectors will quickly assume the leadingrole in high mass ion detection in the 50,000 to 1 MegaDalton mass range--just as they are now wellestablished as the leading detectors for low mass ions.",

The extent to which the same neutron source cold be used alternately for the dual application will be evaluated.  Anticipated benefits include improved production-mode non-destructive inspection capability for hydrogen distribution in engine fan blades for hydrogen concentration in the range 100-200 ppm.  This will contribute to engine maintenance procedures for USAf aircraft, and will also provide engineers performing design and accident analysis with data to help minimize the risks of aircraft engine failure in flight.  Progress that is made in either the jet engine inspection field or the radiation therapy field should have value both in the military and commercial domains.",

To make a sound decision on the use of specific bedding, accurate informationon contact pressure, shear, friction, and blood flow with that product is needed. To address thisconcern, the overall goals for the research are to: determine the most accurate and reproduciblepressure-measuring instruments for each pressure site; develop instrumentation to accurately measureshear; and, incorporate friction and blood flow measurement methods into the evaluation profile. Thespecific aims of this proposed Phase I research are to: (1) design calibration models and calibration testprotocols for pressure-measuring instrumentation. This will be accomplished through feasibility analysisand design of calibration models and protocols; and, (2) determine the feasibility of instrumentation forshear measurement. This will be accomplished with feasibility screens, ranking and evaluations. Theinstruments and procedures developed in this program will be of significant commercial benefit in thedesign, development and qualification of effective bedding and covering materials. The innovativefeatures of this program are true shear measurement, true pressure measurement for beds and anintegrated system for completely characterizing devices used for the prevention of decubiti.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         New materials are the most important issue for the improvement of the present spatial light modulators (SLMs) meeting the requirements for future optical information processing.  Ferroelectric oxides are intrinsically fast response materials, and suitable for low voltage operation because of their large electro-optic (E-O) coefficients.  However, these high figure of merit materials have not been utilized for practical SLM applications because of the difficulties in obtaining high quality materials.  Epitaxial vapor phase growth is an alternative approach to fabricating large area single-crystalline films.  In this Phase I, NZ Applied Technologies and Prof. R.A. Chipman of the University of Alabama in Huntsville propose to demonstrate the feasibility of using thin films of BaTio3 and PLZT, with the largest E-O coefficients known, for SLM fabrication.  The optical quality, single-crystalline films will be epitaxially grown by an innovative plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD).  The PE-CVD is suited for SLMs due to its large-area, low temperature, high growth rate, and low cost fabrication capabilities.  The basic modulator performance of the proposed materials will be determined by a novel Mueller Matrix Imaging method.  In Phase II, the materials will be optimized, and prototype devices will be produced.",

Further, for extremely compelling economic reasons, it is desired that the recharge energy be acquired locally from the environment, i.e. either surface wave energy or deep water ocean currents.  The proposed solution utilizes the concept of Hydropiezoelectricity whereby thin plastic sheets of piezo material(PVDF) are employed to directly convert the large available mechanical energy to electrical power for charging the battery cache. The proposed Phase I effort consists of analysis and simulation tasks designed to determine both the technical and economic feasibility of the approach in typical shallow and deep ocean environments.  An additional task (optional), will be a laboratory demonstration of the approach using power generation modules that are being developed by OPT as part of its efforts to exploit the technology commercially as a source of primary energy.",

Convergence zone behavior and municipal wastewater outfall design and performance rely on characteristics of the density gradient, which is influenced as internal waves interact with steep slopes.

The detection system proposed in the PHASE I final report will be designed to be sufficiently sensitive so as to detect the slight disturbance caused by the eavesdropper. The light-generation system proposed will be designed to create photons whose quantum states are sufficiently well known so that disturbances caused by the eavesdropper can be distinguished from variations of the state inherent in the photon-generation mechanism. Our PHASE I objective will be to determine design criteria in the photon-generation and detection systems to be used in quantum cryptography.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a disease affecting millions of individuals worldwide, has a high incidence of patient mortality. The etiological agent of this disease, the infectious retrovirus HIV-l, has proven refractory to therapeutic intervention. The drugs used in the clinic today only target the viral reverse transcriptase. At best, such drugs temporarily delay disease progression. In addition, these agents exhibit significant toxicity at the effective therapeutic dose. Presently, other compounds targeting reverse transcriptase, viral protease, or the viral Tat trans-activator are also in clinical trials. However, it appears clear that additional drugs may be needed which target other steps in viral replication. One such target is the Rev trans-activator, which is essential for viral replication. The function of Rev is to induce-nuclear export of the partially spliced and unspliced viral messages, which encode the structural gene products and the RNA genome, for infectious HIV-1 particles. We propose to create a Rev-dependent, double reporter assay combined with Oncogene Science's unique cell based high-throughput screening technology, which is capable of evaluating over 123,000 compounds per year, to identify lead compounds which specifically inhibit the HIV-1 Rev trans-activator.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The control of multidrug resistant tuberculosis has been severely hampered by the lack of rapid methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing and diagnosis of mycobacterial infection. The research provides a novel approach to rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing; the testing will be based on One Cell Systems' proprietary microdrop technology. Individual mycobacterial microcolonies will be encapsulated and grown within a very small cloning region defined by a gel microdrop (GMD). Automated analysis of GMDs by flow cytometry following clonal growth and fluorescent staining of the organisms forms the basis of this assay system. Susceptibility of mycobacteria to antibiotics has been detected in 5 days using the GMD- clonal growth method, thus, demonstrating the basic feasibility of this approach. The goals of the Phase I research are to develop quantitative methods for evaluation of mycobacterial growth and resistance to antimicrobial agents. These experiments will form the basis for a commercially viable, rapid mycobacterial assay system, utilizing conventional methods at a microscale. The re-emergence of tuberculosis as a public health problem in the United States points to the urgent need for such a testing system.",

Twenty-two percent of children acquiring E. coli Ol57:H7infection develop potentially fatal complications, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Patientswho develop complications must be hospitalized for long periods, and often require life-long kidneydialysis or kidney transplants. HUS is believed to be caused by verotoxins produced by the offendingbacterium, and there are no antitoxins available for clinical use. We will develop E. coli Ol57:H7antiverotoxin using proprietary methods for the large-scale production of therapeutic polyclonalantibodies from eggs of hyperimmune hens. High-purity avian antitoxins have been shown to havesuperior toxin-neutralizing potency when used in either a parenteral or enteral dosing regimen. Hens willbe immunized with pure E. coli O157:H7 verotoxins, followed by preparation of yolk immunoglobulinfractions. The resulting antibodies will be characterized in vitro by immunochemical analysis and bytoxin neutralization in a vero cell assay. The therapeutic efficacy of antiverotoxin will be assessed invivo in a mouse HUS model using either enteral or parenteral antiverotoxin administration. These studieswill i) provide experimental evidence for the therapeutic utility of antiverotoxin antibodies in E. coliO157:H7 disease, such as HUS, and ii) determine if disease progression can be arrested by antiverotoxinenterally administered and/or whether antiverotoxin is effective when given parenterally.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The proposal program will demonstrate packaging technology in an optical interconnect device consisting of at least 64 parallel interconnections between stages.  The packaging will allow a 1 GHz bandwidth, micro-optoelectronic switch to survive in a 50 g (gravity) shock and vibration environment.  OptiComp's enabling GaAs \"Smart\" optoelectronic interconnect modules will be used in the proposed optical packaging scheme.  High speed inter-chip interconnects are obtained without the power requirements and cross-talk limitation of electronic circuitry.  The global (N4) architecture will provide support for a shipboard optical communications networks, etc.).  The program emphasizes packaging methodology development for the hybrid integration of: -  GaAs vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) arrays; -  Diffractive optical interconnect elements (DOIEs); and - 2D arrays of a metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) detector/transimpedance amplifier.  During Phase II, the optoelectronic packaging technology will be further developed for shipboard beta testing for an application to be selected by the Navy.  Several models will be fabricated during this phase of the program.  Technology transfer in Phase II will be focused toward asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switching fabrics for dual-use commercial applications such as local area and wide area networks (LANs/WANs).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A true single longitudinal mode distributed feedback (DFB) fiber laser will be developed. The first and only, a preliminary demonstration of this laser has just been published, but it is not truly single frequency. We shall develop and commercialize the world's first DFB fiber laser with Bragg gratings written directly onto the core of the fiber. We shall implement an innovative external technique to introduce and control a halp-pi phase shift into the middle of the grating and this would allow only a single frequency to exist at the Bragg wavelength. Phase I will prove the feasibility of the idea, which will be very easy to control and use in large scale manufacturing. Producing the required shift by writing two different gratings has not been attempted and may well prove to be very difficult. With further development in Phase II, this practical, rugged and low-cost fiber laser will have the following characteristics: true single longitudinal mode, high powers in the 50-100 mW range, low relative intensity noise, very narrow linewidth in the tens of kilohertz range. This DFB fiber laser will have a better frequency stability than either a semiconductor diode laser or a distributed Bragg-end-reflector fiber laser because of its increased side-mode separation and suppression. Further, packaging will be easy because fiber lasers are simple and fiber-compatible, and output powers can be scaled up with the pump power and by making the fiber more efficient. The DFB fiber laser also has a wavelength that can be determined to an accuracy of <0.1 nm; this is not possible in DFB laser diodes. The DFB fiber laser will have large scale applications in dual-use technologies, including optical CATV networks, high capacity WDM communication systems, fiber optic sensors and spectroscopy systems. For WDM systems, many tens of channels can be multiplexed and system capacity increased substantially. There is an urgent need to develop and fabricate pressure and temperature tolerant pigtailed DFB lasers for WDM in fiber optic data links at specified pre-selected wavelengths in the 1520-1560 nm range. Our laser will be able to meet these specifications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In this Phase I study, we will demonstrate high power, continuous wave (CW) single spatial mode laser action at the 1 um wavelength. There are two innovative aspects in our proposal: the incorporation of commercially available very high power, not necessarily single mode, semiconductor laser diodes as pump sources; and, a novel single mode fiber, doped with the appropriate rare earth ions. The pump power can be efficiently coupled into and absorbed by the specially coated fiber. This approach is being tried here for the first time. The greatest advantage of our high power fiber laser product will be its enhanced mechanical stability compared to the solid state lasers, which use bulk optical components. Compared with other double clad fiber lasers which use thin films deposited at fiber ends as mirrors, our fiber lasers with Bragg fiber filters are highly resistant to thermal damage. Also, the fiber laser products will be easier to integrate with optical fiber delivery systems than other double clad lasers, and lasers which use crystal based hosts as the gain medium. The one micron fiber lasers have potential applications as superfluorescent sources, and in sensors and lidar. The tunable laser is particularly attractive for spectroscopic applications. These high power and high spectral resolution lasers can be used as sources for high-accuracy measurements of atmospheric aerosols from ground-based, aircraft and space-craft platforms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Computing and communications requirements to support modern C4I systems have undergone considerable expansion in the last decade. Requirements for C4I interoperability between the services, along with recent developments in C4I doctrine (such as C4I for the Warrior) will require far more sophisticated, more complex, and more heterogeneous computing and communications technology. Effective design and optimization of such complex systems to meet C4I performance requirements poses a significant challenge and is of special interest to USAF organizations such as SSC/ENEB and ESC/XR.  Event-driven performance simulation provides detailed, quantitative evaluation beginning early in the development life cycle. Performance simulation examines the ability of the computing and communications hardware to support computational loading, message traffic, data latency, and other mission performance requirements.  OTI proposes the development of a C4I Distributed Performance Simulation Environment (C4I-DPSE) that will enable C4I system architects to fully exploit simulation as a cost-effective tool for predicting the performance of C4I systems.  C4I-DPSE will be an innovative, state-of-the-art environment for simulating high-performance, distributed computer systems on distributed/parallel computing systems.  OTI's proposed simulation environment will employ optimistic distributed simulation techniques such as Time Warp, as well as other innovative approaches to distributed computing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         High accuracy angular measurements have been accomplished with fiber gyros having thermally compensated coils wound with PM fiber. When these types of coils are wound in small diameters, higher bending stresses, a greater number of fiber cross-overs, and reduced rotation sensitivity combine to degrade gyro perforamnce through increased bending losses and polarization crosstalk. These cause increased noise and bias uncertainty. Our proposal presents innovative solutions to these problems. We intend to demonstrate a tension insensitive, thermally compensated winding approach. In Phase I, we will utilize our proposed innovations to design and fabricate a number of ultra-miniature fiber sensing coils (OD<1inch) and verify their performance over temperature using both isolated and \"in-gyro\" test configurations. In Phase II, we will optimize the design parameters critical to performance, develop detailed processes, wind numerous coils (enough for accurate statistics to be performed) and verify their performance via tests within gyro circuits. Anticipated Benefits: A small-volume low-cost fiber gyro, with its inherent ruggedness, long-life and high accuracy is highly applicable to commercial markets involving automotive, aviation, navigation & control, industrial control, autonomous robotics, and tracking antenna systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal deals with the application of advanced mathematical concepts for developing a general purpose, fire detection and suppression system that can be adapted for residential, commercial, and industrial environments.  The system utilizes a suite of common (or future) sensors that are networked; it employs a distributed control strategy with local \"intelligence,\" and uses advanced data and information fusion techniques; this is not a sensor \"voting\" rule.  The Intelligent Fire Control (IFC) system offers improved reliability via redundancy, cross validation and triangulation.  The IFC also offers greater robustness and is less vulnerable to failures in a single sensor or in a control console.  While based on existing sensor hardware, continuous monitoring of the sensors' output allows the control algorithms to utilize the sonsors' proportional output rather than a fixed set-point (threshold) control.  By continuously performing situational assessment before, during, and after a fire event, the IFC is capable, via event-anticipation, of providing high sensitivity with a low false alarm rate.  Furthermore, the IFC is designed to continuously select/deselect necessary fire abatement means for most effective suppression while avoiding unnecessary damage due to water, etc.  The capability for autonomous self inspection, fault detection, and fault tolerance via redundancy or compensation (for a faulty sensor) is built into the system.\r \r The Phase I objectives are to demonstrate (i) the feasibility of such a system via controlled lab experiments, and (ii) a higher detection probability at a lower false alarm rate than a system based on a set-point threshold with a discrete sensor.  Extensive algorithm development and hardware testing will be conducted during Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A novel design approach is proposed that will allow operating a longwave infrared imaging spectrometer sensor with uncooled opto- mechanical components. This proposal is for the technology demonstration and design validation investigation. The concept is based on earlier work at NASA in remote sensing and in IR imaging spectroscopy, and the proposed investigation will capitalize on a JPL investment of $200,000 in labor and developmental hardware. OKSI, and JPD will jointly develop a demonstrate the first functional, room-temperature-optics, thermal-infrared imaging spectrometer for environmental remote sensing. The proposed development will be bolstered by two concurrent OKSI collaborations that will supplement the TRP/SBIR resources at no direct cost of the program. 1) The Institute of Environmental Management, at the University of Oklahoma will provide overall guidance in relation to hazardous materials identification methods and data processing, site selection and field testing of the sensor. Preliminary analysis indicates that remote sensing using thermal infrared imaging spectroscopy is an effective technology for the detection and identification of various hazardous sustances controlled under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendment, and illicuit drugs and chemical weapons manufacturing facilities. 2) Under the Visiting Investigator Program, OKSI and NASA Stennis Space Center will jointly conduct market/technology and end-user requirements/commercialization analyses. A major dual-use aspect of the technology relates to hyperspectral automated target recognition, and to mapping and geographical information systems. Anticipated Benefits: Imaging spectroscopy applications are growing at an explosive rate. The proposed technology will lead to the establishment of the first commercial service providing imaging spectroscopy in the thermal infrared. Applications include environmental monitoring (superfund site monitoring, rapid response for monitoring accidental spills and releases), law enforcement (search for illicit drugs production facilities), and geological, soil and plant studies.",

Each year 50,000cases of Japanese encephalitis are reported officially and more than 30% are fatal. Development ofeffective, safe and economical JEV vaccines for human use is necessary. A highly attenuatedrecombinant JEV, IC47, has been generated using a system for recovering viruses from infectious RNAtranscribed from cDNA templete (infectious cDNA clones). This virus has potential for used as a humanlive vaccine since: 1) it is highly attenuated in mice; 2) it is highly immunogenic, 3) immunization withthe virus protects mice from lethal virulent JEV infection, 4) infected mice do not develop viremia, 5)it is molecularly defined, 6) seed virus can be generate from cDNAs, 7) the cost for the vaccine isreasonable, and 8) manufacturing methods are established. In this Phase I project, the infectious clonesystem will be used to introduce multiple mutations in the IC47 genome to stabilize the attenuationphenotype. Neurovirulence and immunogenicity of the modified virus are studied in mice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Control of vortices on the leading edge of an airfoil has the potential to decrease drag and increase lift by decreasing the pressure on the forward facing and upper airfoil surfaces.  A novel microactuator is proposed which allows for arbitrarily large displacements to be achieved.  The actuator is also mechanically robust as compared to \"conventional\" silicon-based microactuators.  Large arrays of the actuators can be deployed in order to obtain fine control of the boundary layer, without a large weight penalty which is typical of macroscopic systems.  The system will allow for the elimination of fixed stall fences and vortex generators, thereby eliminating the drag which they induce during most flight regimes.  The anticipated effects may be great enough to allow the elimination or the reduction of traditional flight control devices such as rudders and ailerons, when used in a laterally asymmetrical configurations.  The program will accomplish four objectives.  The principal of microactuator controlled vortex generation will be demonstrated in a wind tunnel.  Scale-up and implementation factors will be evaluated.  A simplified microactuator system will be designed and fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the novel microactuator.  Finally, preliminary design of a complete system will be performed to prepare for, and help ensure the success of Phase II and Phase III programs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Orbital Technologies Corporation (ORBITEC) proposes a miniature optical sensor that will be able to accurately measure angle of rotation. The Fiber Optic Rotation Mini-Sensor (FORMS) will also implement fiber optics in such a manner that the sensor will be EMI immune, and smaller than other currently available rotation sensors. The combination of accuracy, stability, reliability, and durability, along with previously stated advantages, of the proposed sensor will demonstrate its superiority over any other currently available rotation sensor. The anticipated accuracy will rival that of commonly used optical encoders. The technology proposed will allow for implementation of this sensor into any system that currently uses a rotation sensor or has a rotation joint, with little or no impact to joint size. Currently perceived applications include: aircraft control surface positions, aircraft door and panel positions, aircraft and launch vehicle thrust control devices, spacecraft antenna and instrument pointing, rotation control knobs, and many commercial applications in areas of biomedicine and consumer products. Anticipated Benefits: The Fiber Optic Rotation Mini-Sensor (FORMS) will provide a small, light-weight, accurate, EMI-immune, miniature rotation sensor for aircraft control surfaces, thrust vector monitors, control and instrumental knobs, other aircraft/spacecraft applications, and many commercial non-aircraft applications. FORMS could replace any currently used rotation sensor and provide new rotation sensing opportunities that were previously not possible due to size, weight, and environmental restrictions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Electrophoresis can resolve thousands of proteins, but analysis of such data is extremely difficult. Automated methods for detection and recognition of proteins on two-dimensional (2D) electrophoretograms are needed. Image processing techniques and expert systems have been tried, but these are computationally intensive, require heuristic rule bases, and cannot identify proteins from analysis of their constituent polypeptide chains. Artificial neural networks are easy to train and implement, and they should correctly categorize an almost unlimited number of proteins by their distinctive polypeptide patterns. We will develop a protein identification system based on neural net recognition of polypeptide distribution in 2D electrophoretograms. Phase I research will develop a demonstration system to examine electrophoretograms of an unknown protein and identify it. The effort is an extension of successful neural net research by ORINCON in such diverse fields as biomedical diagnostics, underwater acoustics, and fault detection. Phase II will incorporate data fusion techniques and an expanded set of known proteins to enable analysis of entire 2D electrophoresis biological samples. This would lead to development of a commercial package for automated protein analysis of 2D electrophoretograms. It easily could be modified to categorize other constituents (e. g., amino and nucleic acids) simply by retraining the net.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In this SBIR effort, ORINCON is proposing application of innovative fusion concepts to a mission of interest.  In particular, we are addressing the JOINT STARS mission that exploits integration of off-board sources such as unmanned serial vehicles (UAVs), airborne warning and control systems (AWACS), and RIVET JOINT. This is one of the goals of the Off-board Augmented Theater Surveillance program at Rome Laboratory.  The innovative fusion concepts we propose to design and develop are:  1) noncooperative target sensor registration (NCTSR) to handle off-board reports/tracks that are biased from truth due to unknown platform and sensor alignment errors; 2) the ability to process time correlated track reports that are sent over to the fusion node from an off-board tracking system; and 3) the development of a Bayesian classification algorithm to exploit parameter attribute and classification clues from various reporting systems.    Each of these designs will be integrated into an existing multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) algorithm that has been developed at ORINCON over a period of 10 years.  The final integrated MRT design will then undergo preliminary testing against Rome Laboratory-approved test scenarios that are representative of JOINT STARS missions.  Results and recommendations will then be summarized in a final test report.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Rigid-flex printed circuits consist of a rigid and flexible electrical laminates sandwiched together to form a composite structure having both rigidity and flexibility. They are attractive for commercial and military high performance applications because size and weight is reduced while reliability is increased. The adhesives utilized in these circuits play a central role in determining the reliability of the rigid-flex circuit. Meeting the thermomechanical stress requirements of military and complex commercial applications is a problem with current adhesives. Several hurdles exist: inadequate bond strengths after thermal cycling, inadequate flexibility where thermal cycling is required, low resistance to decomposition, low dielectric strengths, large Z-axis coefficients of thermal expansion, moisture absorption, low resistance to chemical attack and high costs. This proposal entails the development of new flexible co-polymer adhesives based on newly discovered polyester oligimers which can have higher bond strengths, higher operating and decomposition temperatures, lower coefficients of thermal expansion, and higher flexibility. The adhesives should retain superior properties, even under sever thermal and environmental conditions and should be processable by established processes and equipment. The Phase I objective is to prove the principle of a multifunctional epoxy polyester oligimer co-polymers to bond laminate components of a rigid-flex circuit together. OPTION: $20,008",

Nitrate is naturally generated by the bio-mass in any aquatic system.  Current techniques for the control of nitrate levels are almost exclusively based on water exchange.  For large scale systems these water exchanges are of such large volume as to tax the water and disposal systems on which the aquarium or aquaculture system is dependent.  Our system will avoid these water exchanges by naturally removing the nitrate from the water by controlled usage of anaerobic bacteria, thus allowing large aquarium systems and aquaculture systems to operate in a more environmentally sound, viable, and cost effective fashion.\r \r During Phase I we will build a fuzzy logic based expert system for application to autonomous nitrate control in aquaculture systems and prove its feasibility by implementing and testing it in the University of Texas Marine Biomedical Institute's Cephalopod Culture Project.  During Phase I, we will develop a control system design for Phase II, including parts and pricing, of a full scale system and identification of specific characteristics and capabilities the Phase II system should have.",

A hybrid technique involving a laser beam will be studied in this Phase I effort. The objective of this research is to metallurgically join thermoplastic matrix composites such as PEEK reinforced with AS4, or IM 7/IM 8 fibers using a rapid thermal processing (RTP), active-metal alloy technique. These composites are expected to be used in several modules and components such as fenders, doors, structural panels in automobiles and package housings for the electronics in many commercial and defense systems. The joints produced using these methods are expected to be sound and result in components with high structural intgrity. Destructive tests are proposed in Phase I to evaluate the joint quality and performance. This method would allow for the introduction of intelligent manufacturing systems that could facilitate the rapid production of large sized panels/joints at low costs. In Phase II, further refinement of the processing parameters is expected so that scale up to commercialization would be feasible.",

For commercial applications, multimedia applications with itnegrate voice and video are becoming widespread but are swamping current disk storage technology. What is needed is a new form of data storage disk drive that is small, inexpensive, capable of storing 100 billion to a trillion bytes or more, suitable for mobile applications, and capable of being read, written and rewrittent at a high data rate. By exploiting and extending our unique technology and capability for manufacturing and marketing ultra high density, analog optical memory chips, we propose: Phase I - provide and semonstrate by simulation, a modular engineering design concept for writing, rewriting and reading data onto/from the disk, along with fabrication details of the disk and system design; Phase II - fabricate the device designed in Phase I.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         On-Board Oxygen Generation Systems (OBOGS) are currently monitored using oxygen sensors of the electrochemical variety.  These sensors are subject to degradation with storage or use, and therefore require periodic recalibration or replacement.  The newer zirconia sensors furthermore operate at 750C, generally require a reference gas, and do not measure oxygen at 100% concentration reliably.  It is desirable to monitor to 100%, O2 cylinder gas, which is used at high altitude and as a back-up supply in case of OBOGS failure. Oxigraf proposes to use laser diode absorption spectroscopy in the visible spectrum to monitor oxygen concentration.  The Oxigraf sensor in development for the past five years measures oxygen concentration in medical environments from 5 to 100% with +- 0.2% accuracy with fast 0.1 second response.  This sensor can be perfected in Phase I to measure at aircraft altitude and be insensitive to vibration.  In Phase II, the mean time between maintenance of the sensor can be extended from 1,000 to perhaps 15,000 hours using available improved laser diodes.  In addition, aircraft packaging, electronic interfacing, and thermal, vibration, and other environmental testing can be achieved.  In Phase III< Normalair-Garrett of Yeovil, England, an established supplier of aircraft oxygen systems, is prepared to pursue adoption on military aircraft systems provided the technology is perfected as proposed. A letter of support is attached on page 23 of this proposal.",

The FPA aspect and size will be addressed, as will techniques to improve the throughput of the coherent fiber bundle. Proprietary techniques to reduce the signature of the sensor are also proposed.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Improvement in the quality, size and cost of cadmium zinc telluride, (Cd,Zn)Te, substrates is necessary in order to realize the high performance benefits of HgCdTe based infrared devices. To meet this need we propose an innovative feedback control strategy for vertical Bridgman (VB) crystal growth. Using a computational heat flow model we will formulate a control algorithm that will be coupled with a novel means for manipulating the heat flow during crystal growth. The problem area we are addressing is the ability to actively control the crystal/melt interface shape in the VB configuration to maintain a flat or slightly convex (with respect to the liquid) profile. By doing so, it will be possible to grow crystals with larger diameters and lower defect densities since the potential for stacking faults, twinning and stresses due to radial thermal gradients will be reduced. To achieve the goal of high quality (Cd,Zn)Te growth we have assembled a team that combines state-of-the-art heat flow modeling capabilities, crystal growth experience, and thermal hardware design expertise. Our approach implements a logical developmental process that will lead to the production of improved (Cd,Zn)Te substrates. Anticipated Benefits: There is a constant need to establish more robust manufacturing processes in several areas of IR detector production. The goals presented in this proposed research relate directly to achieving better quality substrate materials which is fundamental to improving overall IR detector producibility and reliability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Current ultrasound images in mine warfare, biomedical imaging and non-destructive testing are limited by the use of linear transducer arrays which result in thick image \"slices\", errors from phase aberrations and primitive volumetric scanning capability.  Two-dimensional arrays will overcome these limitations. Two-dimensional arrays have not been manufactured because of difficulty in fabricating the small structures and low transducer element sensitivity.  The low sensitivity can be overcome by employing multi-layer structures. We propose an innovative, scaleable approach to manufacture low-cost, two-dimensional, multi-layer transducer arrays with low impedance and high sensitivity.  Our approach uses plasma-enhanced, reactive Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) to deposit high- quality, perovskite lead-zirconate lead-titanate (PZT) films as the piezoelectric material and photolithogrpahy with PVD and an innovative, manufacturing scheme to provide the interlayer electrodes and element interconnections. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by fabricating a two-dimensional, multi-layered array and measuring its impedance characteristics and acoustic performance. In Phase II, we will build fully populated two-dimensional, multi-layered imaging arrays and test them for element sensitivity, interelement isolation, electrical impedance and beamforming performance and use them to form three-dimensional images.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Our objective is to develop an innovative thermal management system for recovering waste heat from engines.  The proposed system will tap the large quantities of waste hat from the intercooler of gas turbine engines and use a Rankine cycle to increase the power of core gas turbine, or to drive an electric generator to power auxiliary systems.  The innovative aspect of this thermal management system is to employ Creare's advanced component technology for compact heat exchangers and high-efficiency turbomachines to minimize the size and weight of the energy recovery system.  For aerospace thermal management applications, Creare has developed very compact, high flux heat exchangers which can be used to gather heat from the intercooler as well as to boil and condense the working fluid.  Creare has also developed turbomachinery and systems for aerospace applications in which advanced fabrication techniques enable small size and high efficiency, and non-contact bearings give simplicity and high reliability.  By integrating these advanced technology components, we will develop a lightweight, small volume energy recovery system for gas turbine engines. during Phase I we will select a engine, perform sizing and design studies to develop conceptual designs, select an efficient bottoming cycle based upon our advanced component technology, and prepare a plan to test the system in Phase II.   We will develop this technology for commercial applications for various transportation systems on land, sea, and air, including passenger vehicles with internal combustion engines to improve fuel economy.",

PDRI proposes an innovative approach to criterion development for use by AF researchers.  During the proposed Phase I SBIR effort, we plan to begin development of two sets of criterion measures.  The first set will be designed to link predictor scores directly to their training or job performance analog, thus providing evidence for construct validity using an external construct validation strategy. A second set of technical proficiency performance measures will be constructed and presented in a computerized adaptive rating format, which will help raters to provide more precise, accurate criterion performance scores.  Workshops will be held with subject matter experts to review predictor constructs, target possible analog performance measures for both the training and job settings, and generate critical incidents of effective and ineffective performance.  Our Phase I efforts will conclude with the development and presentation of a demonstration of the new computerized adaptive rating scale technology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We will develop significantly improved automated techniques for detecting the most commonly occurring cytogenetic abnormalities in interphase cells obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Using DNA probes on interphase cells avoids the culturing required for routine cytogenetic analysis. This will reduce the time and cost of prenatal diagnosis and permit extension of the test to a larger segment of the at-risk population. Automation will be particularly important when fetal cells can be isolated from maternal blood samples. This would eliminate the risk of amniocentesis or CVS and extend fetal aneuploidy screening to virtually all pregnancies. We will use fluorescent DNA probe labeling and automated image analysis to quantify the numbers of chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X, and Y in interphase cells. Aneuploidies of these five chromosomes occur in approximately 2% of all prenatal diagnostic tests done for \"advanced maternal age\", and they account for the great majority of all viable cytogenetic abnormalities observed at amniocentesis or CVS. Rapid aneuploidy screening and sex determination will also assist situations involving newborns with multiple congenital anomalies or ambiguous genitalia, suggesting possible trisomy. Interphase cell analysis by in situ hybridization could provide a diagnosis in under 24 hours; a considerable difference compared to the 48-72 hours for conventional cytogenetics done on peripheral blood and 10-14 days for amniocentesis or CVS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ARPA has indentified the need for compact and mobile air sampling equipment with two uses: as a weapons of mass destruction (WMD) monitoring systems or as an air pollution detector. PHI proposes to meet these needs with a novel Raman Scattering and Flourescence instrument using a diode laser and a charge coupled device (CCD) or avalanche photodiode (APD) detector. The instrument selects the Raman or Fluorescence spectral lines to be studied with a circular variable filter (CVF) and a Fabry-Perot (FP) interferometer used in tandem. The instrument can separate Rayleigh scattering, Raman scattering, and Flourescence with spectral and time spectroscopy. Spectral coverage is from 0.5 to 1.1. micron, resolution is 2cm1` and sensitivity to parts per trillion. A conventional germanium detector of soft gamma rays or a novel gamma ray Compton scattering telescope system proprietary to PHI will map isomer radiation from the alpha decay of uranium of plutonium for nuclear WMD applications. PHI has assembled an outstanding technical team to perform this research and this team will show the feasibility of these concepts in Phase I. In Phase II, PHI hopes to guide the team to develop a prototype in a timely and cost effective manner. The aforementioned team includes: Dr. Anthony Hull of OCA Applied Optics Co. of Garden Grove CA, and Dr. Theodore Gay of PHI. Consultants include: Iowa State and Penn. State (Meteorology Dept.). All participants have many years of experience in the state of the art. Anticipated Benefits: The benefits and commercial applications of this proposed device include: Analysis of air pollution at low cost with a light weight, compact sensor constant monitoring and control of pollution from public utility and aircraft turbines; analysis of complex semiconductor and catalyst structures, such as superlattices; and portable analysis of biological compounds for real time diagnosis of disease.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The primary problem to be addressed by this SBIR request is the need for development of specific ion sensors that can work reliably in sub-freezing environments to allow unmanned dataloggers to accumulate data on a down-loaded or real-time basis.  This would involve re-designing the reference side of the electrode (half-cell) to be rugged enough to survive the conditions imposed upon it while also determining whether the changes would compromise with several variables would also require electronic isolation techniques to prevent problems associated with ground-loops that could prove to be substantial in colder soils and groundwater of very low conductivity. Another problem that presents itself is the ability to miniaturize the sensor/transmitter in such a manner as to enable insertion into very small wells which would decrease the cost of application.  Surface mount electronics will be used for this purpose.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The capability to produce realistic Infrared images using DMA databases is severely limited by the data itself, most notably the lack of thermal/optical properties.  In the proposed effort, a methodology is described/prototyped for including material properties data (MPD)into polygonal databases which can be used as input to IR scene simulators.  Two methodologies representing opposite ends of the spectrum are: 1) inclusion of MPD data layers for every polygon which results in high storage requirements and is computationally inefficient but offers the highest degree of flexibility and fidelity, and 2) the use of precomputed \"radiance texture maps,\" for each of the DMA single layer.  This method is computationally fast, has low storage requirements, but suffers from reduced flexibility and fidelity.  PRA believes the solution lies in a combination of these two methods, where tradeoffs determined by simulator designers and scene dynamics drive requirements.  Using an adaptation of methodologies PRA has already developed to produce input databases for the GENESSIS terrain model and Sensor Vision real-time scene generator.  PRA will conduct a technical feasibility analysis of the proposed method and develop a system design.",

The assay utilizes a novel biosensor, with molecular recogni-tion/binding as the detection element and a proprietary, integrated optic interferometer as the transducer.The unique design of the interferometer minimizes thermomechanicaI noise to provide a highly stableplatform for sensing very low concentrations of specific biomolecules, chemicals or microorganisms ineither aqueous or gaseous environments. The approach relies on the detection of small refractive indexchanges at the surface of the interferometer. When receptor molecules are immobilized on theinterferometer surface, the subsequent binding of specific ligands results in a pronounced refractiveindex change. An assay based on this approach has a number of key advantages: l) it is rapid (equal toor less than 15 minutes), 2) it is sensitive (picogram/milliliter range), 3) it is simple (no labeling ortagging) and 4) it is low cost (< $5 unit cost, no expensive analytic instrumentation). The biosensorcan be packaged as a hand-held device, suitable for out-of-lab use. Moreover, the technology offers thepotential of simultaneously testing for several respiratory infections (e.g.; influenza A, influenza B, RVS,parainfluenza) in a single assay.",

To help achieve this goal, the PAWS-OLP system will be transitioned for commercial use. The PAWS-OLP system was developed to provide a greater degree of automation within the off-line planning process. We propose to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of PAWS-OLP by porting its internal solid modeler to ACIS, a commercial solid modeling system. This will include an evaluation of native ACIS functions for supporting the innovative optimization algorithms within PAWS-OLP. Additionally, we will develop a neutral file format for exchanging welding process information. As a result of this work, we will demonstrate the feasibility of batch processing welding jobs by importing a CAD file describing a part to be welded and automatically generating the controller files needed to weld in the PAWS welding cell.",

Acoustical methods need to be evaluated for aircraft health monitoring on a realtime basis to detect defective mechanical components before failure.  Physical Acoustics Corporation proposes to implement both acoustic emission non-destructive testing and neural networks to perform pattern classification on data resulting from a combination of three signal processing concepts.  Neural networks are well know for their ability to solve non-linear classification problems with high execution speeds, making them well suited for real-time applications.  Our technical objectives for Phase I are aimed at establishing a solid proof of concept that supports the development of a commercially viable system for monitoring rotorcraft mechanical components in-flight, as well as detecting and locating specific problems in real-time.  The ultimate goal is to develop and market an advanced technology health monitoring system which will initially benefit the defense industry and eventually become available for civil applications.",

The OPAS system architecture is based on a recent Air Force patent application of Dr. Joe Horner of Rome Laboratory, which is related to a Joint Transform Correlator.  The phase masks will be fabricated using POC's proprietary volume and surface relief materials and recording technology, and will involve new phase compensation techniques, which are critical for coherent optical processing.  Because of its simplicity and promise for a high confidence level for security applications, the proposed OPAS is extremely well suited to practical applications, and can produce the next generation in authentication systems with greatly improved performance and lower costs.  The master phase mask that will be developed in Phase I is impossible to copy or replicate without the absolute knowledge of the code, because phase structures cannot be decoded.  The entire OPA system will be realized in Phase II as a pre-production prototype.  The resulting OPAS will have many dual-use applications, ranging from government security systems to automatic banking, and widespread verification ID verifications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Optical link technology used for cryogenic focal plan array (FPA) readout not only is immune to electromagnetic interference, but also can reduce the heat load of the Dewar.  Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes the use of a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL), in conjunction with fiber optics, as the key element of the optical link for cryogenic FPA readout. The VCSEL-based optical link would provide the best system performance (as compared with other optical link technologies) including power dissipation, thermal stability, optical coupling efficiency and insertion loss, optical signal contrast ration, component reliability and optical packaging stability.  Together with the optoelectronic system-engineering experience provided by POC, we firmly believe that the proposed VCSEL-based cryogenic optical link is the right choice for success.  In Phase I, a number of VCSEL-based optical link designs will be analyzed an devaluated. Their trade-off study will also be presented.  A laboratory experiment will be carried out to demonstrate feasibility and potential.  Finally a Phase II demonstration prototype plan will be developed in Phase I.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Advances in integrated circuit fabrication require large numbers of high resolution masks for lithographic purposes.  State-of-the-art lithographic tools have showed good submicron resolution, but are generally made on chrome-coated glass.  The associated chrome coating, writing, photoresist processing, and etching have produced enormous chemical waste for the IC industry..  Physical Optics Corporation proposes a high-energy-beam sensitive glass as the mask blank for mask fabrication.  The mask's pattern can be written into a thin layer of an ion-exchanged glass medium by high energy beams, like E-beams, deep UV, or short wavelength laser beams (180-200 nm), with high resolution (~0.2 um).  The writing can also be performed by longer wavelength beams (400 to 900 nm) on an E-beam pre-exposed mask blank using an erasure mode.  Low cost mask writing and replication provide enormous advantages.  Stability of the masks under actinic radiation is expected.  Phase I will demonstrate the concept's feasibility, good resolution, and high optical density in the darkened areas.  A cost effective mask making machine will also be designed.  Phase II will produce a new generation mask machine, based on the high-energy-beam-sensitive glass technology.",

POC's proposed Moth-Eye structures are surface relief patterns that possess extremely broadband anti-reflective spectral characteristics.  They can be generated over the majority of plastics, such as polycarbonate, polyurethane, and plexiglass with minimal optical distortion.  In this Phase I program, POX will emboss moth-eye structures on appliques supplied by 3M's Automotive Design Systems Division.  The large scale moth-eye appliques will meet the requirements of military specification MIL-P-3847A (USAF). This approach will enable POC to meet the environmental requirements and signature suppression needs of the Air Force. There are no toxic solvents, paints, or strippers involved in the embossing process.  Phase I will determine the maximum achievable holographic master size and demonstrate the embossing process on 3M appliques.  Phase II will lead to the in-depth fabrication of metal masters for rapid and inexpensive fabrication of stealth structures on appliques that are transferred to aircraft.",

The new neural network architecture will have the ability to integrate the complete and incomplete multiple sensor data to be used in multisensor data fusion.  The first step is to generate a data \"cookbook\" based on careful and precise analyses of each sensor's characteristics.  Next, POC will implement the optimum fuzzy rules based on the data \"cookbook.\"  In this procedure, POC will supply dynamic fuzzy programming techniques that can manipulate currently used sensors to generate pseudo-weights of malfunctioning or absent sensors.  Such adaptive weight generation will efficiently correct the sensor defects, distortions and misalignments, eventually optimizing the performance of the multisensor data fusion and maximizing its advantages, such as robustness, high accuracy, and multi-dimensional measurement.",

However the difficulties of interfacing between a workstation and different data recording instruments still hamper their use in testing. Physitron proposes to develop an integrated test and measurement workstation for on-site data analysis and data visualization. The major emphasis of this proposed work will be to combine various data acquisition schemes including the GPIB, VXI, RS-232, and plug-in boards and advanced visualization techniques. With this development, data collected from the sensors can be recorded by the workstation and manipulated by the data visualization software.  Phase I activities includes identification of the hardware and software necessities, integration of a workstation with several data recording systems, identification of a data processing scheme, and identification of visualization software. In this way, optimization of the data acquisition, analysis, and presentation can be attained.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Gamma ray induced failures are major threats to computer systems deployed in space.  If not treated properly, radiation errors can seriously jeopardize a space or missile mission.  In common practice, safety-critical computer equipment for space usually employs hardening combined with hardware redundancy to cope with radiation-induced errors.  However, this technology is expensive, especially for payload developers.  This project investigates an alternative, much less expensive architecture for the development of reliable payload controllers that relies on off-the-shelf computers and software, multi-programming, and on software implemented fault tolerance (SIFT) to achieve reliability.  In the SIFT approach, memory is replicated, and multiple copies of the same program are executed and correct results of computations are decided by majority vote.  The objective of the project is to design the architecture of a reliable payload controller, implement it, and to perform experiments that show its suitability to cope with gamma radiation.  Moreover, the techniques developed in this project will be computerized in a payload controller shell that enables payload developers to employ these technologies in payloads.  The proposal develops techniques and software to improve the performance, endurance, and survivability of space and missile payloads.",

The system will be equipped with an independent power source and a two way radio or cellular telephone telemetry channel.  Special attention will be paid to protect against environmental hazards and vandalism, so that the system could be readily adapted for submersible use.  In addition to its primary intended use - tsunami runup measurement - the system could also be used for the measurement of storm surge runups in hurricane-prone areas, flood water levels, etc.  The systems modular design will facilitate easy transport, assembly and installation.",

This Phase I effort proposes to evaluate two different optical methods for measuring tissue pH by collecting data from an animal model of ischemia. Optical signals from exposed muscle, as well as deep muscle tissue obscured by skin will be evaluated.  Data collected by the non-invasive optical sensor will be correlated with pH measured by tissue pH electrodes to determine the most sensitive method for optically measuring pH and the appropriate wavelengths for use in the final sensor design.  The goal of this project is to develop a conceptual design for a lightweight, portable, optical-based sensor and monitor capable of measuring pH for the assessment of tissue viability.",

Polyprobe has developed reagents and methods for the macromolecular assembly of nucleic acid dendrimers. Dendrimer size can be accurately controlled in the range of a few hundred base pairs to more than ten million base pairs. The resulting molecules have multiple single stranded regions and number of single stranded regions are dependent on the size of the dendrimer (typically 10E9 binding sites per nanogram dendrimer). Specificity for a particular sequence ca be added via hybridization to the available single stranded regions.

This application demonstrates the ideal suitability of the lithium-ion battery for both space and portable electronics applications. PolyStor Corporation personnel have previously developed a high capacity carbon foam anode tehcnology (used in all \"potential\" lithium ion system couples) which has reached the theoretical capacity limit (372 mA.hr/gm carbon, compared to Sony's 206 mA.hr/gm). The best present high voltage cathode technology is expensive to produce asnd has a useful capacity of about one third of this value (125mA.hr/gm, high temperature LiCo02) and is therefore not well matched to the anode. Improvements in the cathode specific capacity and manufacturability provide the best means to substantially improve battery performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A high response internal fault detection (IFD) and classification  system is designed for large permanent magnet synchronous machines  using multiple electromagnetic detection methods and thyristor  controlled stator winding isolation techniques.  Four broad categories  of stator faults including dielectric failures, short circuit faults,  core failures and open circuits are covered by the IFD.  Three IFD  control schemes are to be investigated and designed for specific  application to the 25,000 HP class PM machines of the Navy ASMP  project; these schemes include field oriented vector (FOV) detection  and magnetically polorized fiber optic detectors to determine  unbalances in the machine airgap flux and magnetic core flux.  The  result of using a field oriented vector yields optimum values for  terminal excitation in Volts/Hertz when the PM motor is operated by  inverter dirive under abnormal conditions occuring with stator winding  isolation.  The novel aspects of the approach in addition to the  150-300 microsecond response time include the ability to modulate the  thyristor-stator winding switching to avoid step functions in terminal  voltage or power and the ability to control the machine reactive power  flow in an optimum fashion.",

The sonar reflection data will be integrated to both differential GPS navigation and spot geotechnical measurements in a manner that will provide rapid large scale assessment of marine soil properties. The cumulative survey results will be presented, in real time, in the form of computer generated contour maps detailing dediment property variations in density, prosity, and shear strength.  A large portion of the sonar system development will be extracted from our Navy sponsored research 6(biography).  Minimal new research is needed for the actual sonar hardware component of this development effort.  The new research that is needed and  proposed will focus on developing the interface between the acoustic measurements and geotechnical measurements taken from such devices as penetrometers, instumented cones, vibratory corers, and other devices.  At selected site locations, the data from these measurements will be entered as ground truth into the system computer model.  The ground truth data is used in the computer program to calibrate the models that relate acoustic impedance to sediment properties 6.  This research will result in the design of a commercial low cost combined acoustic/geotechnical instrument that will perform rapid material resource assessment, pollution monitoring, and provide data for marine construction design.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose developing a diode laser-based full-spectrum Raman scattering instrument prototype incorporating fiberoptic coupling for rapid, continuous on-line and remote monitoring of fuels. Raman's narrow, well-defined peaks and its insensitivity to moisture contamination allow for full-spectrum detection with 0.1% sensitivity for liquids and with 30 to 60 second response times. Traditional Raman scattering performed with visible light excitation is not compatible with liquid hydrocarbon systems because of background fluorescence.  Conventional gas lasers have too short of a life and are too expensive for routine commercial instrumentation.  A semiconductor laser diode offers longer life than conventional lasers and can operate at near-IR wavelengths where sample fluorescence is minimized while taking advantage of the very sensitive and full-spectrum capabilities of silicon CCD array Raman spectrum detection.  Fiberoptic coupling allows the safe application of Raman scattering in hazardous environments, eliminates lag time, reduces maintenance of sample handling systems while affording remote location of vibration sensitive equipment. Laboratory results have demonstrated the ability to quickly measure gasoline components and parameters including individual aromatics, such as benzene, olefine contents, unique brand formulations, octane ratings and EPA-required oxygenated additives.  Phase I will compare the prototype instrument with laboratory results.",

The two recombinant proteins are CD4-gamma2, a homodimercontaining two chains of a CD4-human IgG2 heavy chain fusion protein; and, CD4-IgG2, a heterotetram-er containing two chains of a CD4-human IgG2 heavy chain fusion protein and two chains of aCD4-human kappa light chain fusion protein. The major advantage of CD4-based molecules overmonoclonal antibodies as candidate imaging agents is that CD4 binds with high affinity to the HIV-1envelope glycoprotein gp120/gp41 of all stains of the virus. The development of an in vivo imagingagent for HIV-1 disease will likely provide new insights into the pathogenesis of this disease and be avaluable tool in the management of HIV-1 infected individuals.",

These multiplex-compatible amplifiable markers willhave the advantage of simplified analysis versus current PCR-based marker systems, allowing detectionin a new agarose gel format rather than requiring denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The markers will alsobe amenable to fluorescent analysis rather than requiring radioactive detection. In phase l, the plan isto describe a method to identify large-numbers of the new markers and to isolate and characterizeseveral examples. In addition, the basic expectations that they will produce precise amplificationproducts and that their allelic content can be determined more efficiently, safely, and cheaply than othersystems will be demonstrated. This will establish the superiority of this marker class and support thework of phase Il which includes isolation of a large number of the markers, more thorough characteriza-tion of their polymorphic content, and application in generation of linkage maps. In phase I, fluorescentdetection methods will be surveyed and selected to demonstrate that the improved \"allele quality\"simplifies detection enhancing the process of automated data retrieval and analysis using a newfluorescent imaging reader. The result will establish the feasibility of the phase ill goal of developmentof a fully integrated system of amplification, simplified electrophoretic separations, fluorescent detection,and automated data analysis.",

The insurance industry has recently addressed this problem through the implementationof drug interaction alerts to pharmacists in conjunction with immediate on line claims adjudication foralmost 60% of prescriptions (and increasing rapidly). These alerts are based on stored patient drugprofiles of third party administrators (TPAs) which are updated whenever prescriptions are filled. Whilethese alerts are very helpful, the pharmacist does not prescribe, resulting in time-consuming and costlydelays to contact the physician to remedy potential interactions. We will address this problem byevaluating the feasibility of making the drug profile and interaction information easily available to thephysician before the prescription is written. By utilizing the existing drug profiles from TPAs and initiallyproviding information delivery to physicians by fax using touch-tone phone requests, we believe that thissystem can be created and operated cost-effectively. Delivering the relevant information to the point ofdecision should result in further decreases in adverse drug reactions, simultaneously improving thequality and decreasing the cost of medical care.",

Pulse Radar, Inc., a U.S. company, headquartered in Houston, Texas, proposes to construct a unique air-coupled dual antenna system for both shallow and deep ground penetration. Shallow penetration will measure thickness and integrity of upper pavement layers. Deep penetratin will determine the location of bedrock which is critical in interpreting deflection data. The Phase I goal is to define the system and components suitable for Phase II construction and testing of a mobile pavement evaluation unit meeting all military criteria. Phase I objectives are: o To refine our existing 1 GHz horn antenna system to produce a clear, clean radar pulse, minimizing system jitter and clutter, for layer thickness determination, o To develop and test our current prototype low frequency antenna for bedrock determination, o To develop integrated software for data acquisitin and display from the dual system, and o To develop mproved automated signal processing software for layer thickness calculations. Pulse Radar, Inc. already manufactures and retails in the USA and foreign countries, a van-mounted shallow penetration antenna system called RODAR R-4 for pavement layer thickness determination. The development of a dual antenna system, real time analysis, and automated signal processing software will greatly expand its usefulness and commercial potential.",

Several applications for laser-deposition materials are merging.  At present, little infrastructure exists to support PLD in comparison to conventional physical vapor disposition approaches.  Due to the pulsed nature of the laser deposition process, standard deposition rate controllers cannot be reliably used.  New techniques for monitoring an controlling both deposition rate and on-target laser fluency will be needing in order for PLD to become a production process.  The PLD process also needs to be scaled up to substrate sizes compatible with commercial and military applications.  This proposal plans first to identify several emerging applications for PLD.  We will than develop a system design compatible with large-area laser deposition incorporating a novel laser entrance window, a unique deposition rate controller based on atomic absorption, and custom software. In the Phase II program, this system will be built and fully tested.  Such a unit will provide intelligent closed-loop process control of relevant parameters for reproducible film growth, i.e., deposition rate and on-target laser fluency, thus making PLD a production-worthy film growth process.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         An advanced wideband (>2GHz), fast-switching (<100 ns), high-resolution (10-14bit) direct digital synthesis (DDS) system is proposed using InP heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) technology. An innovative digital-to-analog converter (d/a) compensation technique offers 10 to 20 dB improvement in signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) and spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR). A unique DDS system architecture facilitates rapid switching between standard sinusoidal and user-defined waveforms. Innovative digital and d/a circuits are proposed to realize the DDS system. The proposed InP HBT process enables clock rates beyond 20 Gs/s. The proposed combination of architecture and circuit innovation combined with an advanced InP HBT process will facilitate the production of a DDS system providing an order of magnitude performance improvement. During Phase I, the DDS' system architecture will be defined and key cells simulated to assess the design's feasibility. Prototype DDS system subcircuits will be fabricated and tested during Phase II. The significant government and commercial potential for this advanced DDS system is expected to quickly lead to Phase III product development and commercialization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In this proposal, Quadrant Engineering seeks SBIR funds to develop a ground-based polarimetric millimeter-wave radar for studying the distribution, dynamics and microphysics of nonprecipitating clouds. The proposed radar will utilize a high duty-cycle kylston amplifier, low-noise amplifiers and a 2 m diameter antenna to achieve greater sensitivity than any existing millimeter-wave cloud radar.  Pulse-to pulse polarization switching will allow measurement of all important polarimetric quantities and will permit unambiguous measurement of velocity under high wind conditions using a dual-polarization pulse pair algorithm.  The radar system will also include a state-of-the-art data acquisition system implemented using commercially available VXI-based components.  In order to meet the Air Force's operational and scientific needs, Quadrant Engineering will consult with AF meteorologists and engineering staff to optimize system requirements.  These consultation will be carried out early in Phase I to pin down specifications for the radar, data system and mechanical layout.",

We now propose to create a new type of magnetic sensor in which a stochastically resonating superconducting system, acts as preamplifier for a conventional SQUID. Our proposed work will take advantage of the increase in signal to noise ratio and noise tolerance exhibited by the stochastic resonance effect to significantly improve SQUID based magnetic detection. In Phase I, we will demonstrate these enhancements in a laboratory prototype made from discrete components and provide a preliminary design for an optimized sensor. In Phase II, we will fabricate a complete, integrated sensor in high-Tc superconducting materials. The system will be a portable, stand alone unit and contain all necessary support electronics.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Impulsive acoustic sources have several advantages and disadvantages On the positive side, they are highly mobile and deliver a high source level without the use of connecting cables. On the negative side, their combination of high power and nondirectionality yields a high background of reverberation or clutter that obscures the desired echo. In addition, the transmit waveform cannot be easily altered or coded to take advantage of propagation and target characteristics. The Navy has expended a great deal of resources to correct these deficiencies in the back end signal processing. The innovative technique described in this proposal takes an entirely fresh approach: Alter the source to yield intrinsic clutter rejection properties, which can be exploited with proper signal processing techniques. The Phase I product will be an innovative impulse source design which provides the optimum coded waveform and the corresponding advanced signal processing. This involves several design tradeoffs including performance, signal processing complexity, and cost. The work plan includes a source configuration study and a sonobuoy implementation and cost study.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         HSV-l is the major infectious cause of corneal blindness in the United States. Redox has synthesized transition metal complexes (CTC compounds) exhibiting potent in vitro activity against herpes group viruses. Significantly, the mode of action of these novel compounds differs from currently available antiviral nucleoside analogs. One CTC compound exhibits pronounced efficacy in the topical therapy of HSV-1-induced stromal disease in the rabbit eye. The chemical rationale for the synthesis of CTC compounds, coupled with preliminary biological activity analyses, suggests that other CTC modified complexes with active group substituents may demonstrate enhanced efficacy in topical therapy treatment of stromal disease. Phase I research identifies leading CTC compounds (35 chemically- engineered, biologically-active compounds). In addition, Phase I research evaluates effects of these compounds in vitro and in vivo on HSV-1 recovery and clinical progression of ocular HSV-1 stromal disease development and epithelial keratitis in rabbits. Phase II includes selection of 1 or 2 leading CTC compounds for further development as single-agent therapy against HSV-l induced ocular stromal disease in the rabbit. Additionally, Phase II in vitro studies will investigate the mechanism of CTC antiviral activity at functional (protein products) and other molecular targets in HSV infected cells.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         During the past two years, RTA scientists have developed a numerical scheme for the detection and classification (D/C) of signals in highly noisy environments (negative SNR). This method performs D/C using nonlinear signal information, based on techniques developed from the theory of Chaotic dynamics. Preliminary tests on real-world data sets, recently supplied by Navy personnel, indicate that this method will likely outperform most current linear classification methods, provided the signal of interest contains some nonlinear correlations. In addition, this method has been modified to perform D/C on transient signals (e.g. active pulses), with correspondingly good performance. These algorithms are quite computationally efficient, and can be implemented on any standard workstation environment. The current aim of the research program will be to further refine these methods, measure operating characteristics, characterize performance on a variety of real-world data sets, and especially to modify the basic scheme for a variety of other problems of interest to the Navy. Anticipated benefits to the Navy will be electronic signal recognition and classification technologies with significantly improved performance characteristics, especially suited to high noise environments.",

The product is an integrated system consisting of data generation and acquisition, data analysis, and mechanics modeling of intermetallic and metal matrix composite (MMC) materials.  The system will provide a complete multiaxial characterization of MMC response under multiaxial loading conditions in a form that is directly usable by test engineers and designers.  The research effort will build on work performed by the Air Force, and will focus on developing and validating a mechanistic method to characterize and describe MMC response under multiaxial stresses, general load orientations, and under thermal and environmental conditions of interest.  The development of the mechanistic method is a necessary pre-requisite to developing a technically sound and marketable product.  The work scope in Phase will involve both analytical modeling and experimental work.  The product will enable test engineers an improved interpretation of test data involving multiaxial stresses.  It will help designers by providing them with more complete material characterization information than is currently available to them for performing structural analyses.",

Current training methods require the presence of an instructor in both initial and ongoing training of perishable skills. This increases the cost and decreases the practicality of training as the RIO must be present at a training facility to receive training, thereby taking time away from the job. The proposed work would augment the activities of the human trainer by using artificial intelligence (AI), intelligent tutoring system (ITS) and virtual reality (VR) techniques to develop automated, self-contained, and portable training devices for maintaining perishable skills. This would enable the RIO to receive training at his convenience with minimal disruption to his duties. Phase I will be devoted to a task analysis of RIO training requirements and to development of a proff-of-concept system. Phase II will be devoted to developing a full-scale training system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         It is well known that lasers are used in numerous military and civilian applications. Many laser-based systems, such as laser weapons, rely on beam steering. Advanced mass storage technologies, in particular, depend on scanning laser beams for reading and writing information. There has been a need for a beam-steering device that eliminates the complexity and the sluggishness of present methods and reduces the size required. Reveo has invented such a device. The so called, Electro-Optical Beam Steering Device, is ultra-compact and provides switching speeds of less than a microsecond, limited only by material constraints. There is no known technology that can deliver these levels of performance. The invention makes use of a new class of materials, cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) polymers, that have the unique property of transmitting right-circularly polarized light and reflecting left-circularly polarized light or vice versa. In Phase I, various cholesteric liquid crystal polymer blends will be synthesized to optimize the transmit/reflectance properties. A simple prototype will be demonstrated to provide proof of concept. During Phase II, the resolution and complexity will be increased as well as exploring CLC polymers that allow different wavelengths to be transmitted/reflected. Anticipated Benefits: Electro-Optic beam steering is an ideal candidate for dual use. Advanced mass storage technologies, in particular, depend on scanning laser beams for reading and writing information. In addition to is use in mass storate, Reveo's radically new beam-steering device can also be used for many other purposes such as laser weapons, holographic storage, laser radar's, and other advanced optical systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The goal is to develop an assay to identify potential antiviral and anticancer compounds. Theassay is based on the activity of the cellular enzyme PKR (Protein Kinase RNA-activated). PKR is inducedby interferon and requires double-stranded RNA for activation. Activated PKR inhibits translation. Byinhibiting translation the cell stops viral replication since viruses are dependent on host translation. Someviruses (adenovirus, vaccinia virus, rotavirus, reovirus, poliovirus, influenza, and possibly HIV) haveevolved mechanisms to counteract this anti viral system by inhibiting PKR. The fact that manypathogenic viruses have inhibitors of PKR suggests that inhibition of this enzyme is important for viralreplication. In addition to its anti viral effects, PKR may also function as a suppressor of cell proliferationand tumor formation. Though tightly regulated, PKR apparently must be expressed and activated attimes during the cell cycle. In this context, activators of PKR may be useful as antitumorigeniccompounds, since activation could inhibit translation, perhaps leading to growth suppression of thetumor. The assay described here is a simple assay of PKR activity that can be adapted to identifyactivators of PKR, or to identify compounds that block viral inhibitors of PKR.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In its continuing efforts to automate complex ordnance resupply operations using robotic systems, the U.S. Army faces a number of demanding technical problems that represent the leading edge of robot control theory, including the development of flexible task-level programming environments, issues of robot mobility and base motion effects, multi-sensor integration, multi-arm coordination, compliance control, and robot calibration.  Many of these specific problems have already been addressed by researchers working independently over the last six years at NASA laboratories, at NIST, and at academic institutions across the U.S.  By far the majority of this new control technology has been accomplished using seven degree-of=freedom, force/position-controlled manipulators supplied by Robotics REsearch Corporation.  This proposal outlines a project by which the Army can leverage this prior work by capturing the key elements of existing government-funded control software in a new open architecture, high-level robot control system.  We will formalize new architecture interfaces, assemble a library of existing robot control software, and modify that software to conform to the new open architecure --allowing it to be mixed and matched, dynamically, to meet the specific needs of particular applications.  By establishing appropriate software module interface standards, this software library will not be limited to use with RRC robots, but will operate any conforming robot system.",

With the development of subtractive color liquid crystal displays (SCLCD), color information can be used as an additional parameter to convey information to the pilot.  Unfortunately, the image locations for the three primary colors of current SCLCDs are displaced longitudinally along the optical axis, making a light-weight, optical design difficult.  Diffractive optical elements have the potential to provide chromatic aberration correction, weight reduction, and aberration correction necessary for a SCLCD HMD.  During Phase I, we will analyze several concepts utilizing diffractive optics in color HMD systems.  The designs will characterize combination of beamsplitters and visor/combiners, including a tilted, off-axis visor/combiner.  These designs will demonstrate the light-weight optical and mechanical sub-systems required to implement the HMD display with a standard helmet shell. To demonstrate the color correction that can be obtained with diffractive elements, a fabricate a prototype system for a SCLCD, measure its performance, and compute the experimental results with design predictions.  In Phase II we will optimize and fabricate the color HMD system that utilizes SCLCD technology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         For missile guidance applications, there is a need for an infrared (IR) zoom lens that is compact, light-weight and environmentally rugged.  In this program we will design an innovative IR zoom lens concept that uses lateral displacements of non-traditional optical elements to implement the zoom effect.  The zoom lens consists, in part, of two lateral-shift, variable-focus lens groups.  Our preliminary designs indicate that IR zoom lenses that employ lateral displacements may satisfy the size constraints and magnification ratios needed for missile guidance applications. We propose to design a f/4.5 LSI zoom lens with a magnification zoom ration of 4:1 that covers full fields of view ranging from 4.6 degrees to 18.2 degrees.  The lens is designed to image the full field onto a focal-plane detector that consists of 480 x 640 pixels with 20-micrometer center-to=center spacings.  Our goal is to keep the overall length of the zoom lens less than 150 mm, and to keep the diameter of the lens less than 75 mm.  The proposed design represents a unique and innovative approach to infrared zoom lens design.  As a result of this investigation, it is high likely that a new class of high performance, compact, infrared zoom lenses that area useful for missile guidance applications will emerge.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Ultra-high-purity silica microspheres recently were introduced primarily for analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). However, these materials are expensive and are available only in limited configurations. The aim is to explore new methods for preparing strong, ultra-high-purity silica microspheres (or microspheroids) of lower cost in a variety of configurations (particle size, pore size, etc.) for various separation processes. The availability of these ultra-pure, less-acidic silica particles would permit superior separations of sensitive materials, particularly those of biological origins. Such particles also would produce higher separation yields with fewer problems than are associated with currently-available silicas. Porous silica microspheroids in the 2-20 mu m range are useful for analytical HPLC separations. Similar 10-50 mu m particles are well suited for preparative HPLC and as support media for high-performance solid-phase extraction and affinity chromatography. Methods also will be sought to prepare superficially porous microspheres to permit very fast separations of macromolecules with conventional HPLC apparatus, techniques and column-packing methods. The purpose of Phase I is to develop practical preparation methods to permit ultimate commercialization of the porous silica particles of this project.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Experimentation in cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience often involves thetime-controlled presentation of text, pictures, sounds, or other types of stimuli, and the collection ofbehavioral responses. Given that each individual laboratory and experiment has somewhat idiosyncraticrequirements, development of software for experiment control is usually a time-consuming and expensiveprocess, often entailing substantial duplication of effort between laboratories. The existence ofconvenient, flexible, and powerful authoring tools for cognitive experimentation would accelerate theprogress of research and would reduce associated costs. We will develop an advanced laboratorysoftware package, the Neurocognitive Experiment Authoring Tool (NEAT), that will provide precisecontrol over event timing and stimulus characteristics with unprecedented flexibility and simplicity inexperiment design and implementation. NEAT will be optimized for experiments collecting reactiontimes, event-related potentials, functional brain images, and other cognitive and/or neural measurements.It will initially run under Microsoft Windows and will offer a user-friendly graphical interface forexperiment scripting, compatibility with popular multimedia tools for development of sophisticatedgraphic or auditory stimulus sets, facilities for timed control of external devices, and functions fororganizing and exporting behavioral datasets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         New integrated circuit fabrication technologies will require rapid positioning, with accuracies in the nanometer range, over a workspace spanning hundreds of millimeters. This will require a two-stage mechanism: One stage capable of moving over a large span, carrying a smaller \"mini-actuator.\" As the first stage approaches the desired position, the second stage actuator will take over and do the final positioning. The key to fast and accurate positioning combines several elements: Fast and controllable short stroke actuation; rapid long stroke actuation; low noise sensors; and control systems. Magnetostrictive actuators lend themselves well to the short stroke actuator. A high performance capacitive gauge will be used for feedback. Voice coil actuators are an established technology for rapid, large motions. Optical scales using diffraction interpolation are available with nanometer repeatability. These are suitable as long range sensors. A control system for a dual-actuator, one-axis ultraprecision positioner would use an LQR design, aimed at keeping the short stroke actuator near the center of its actuation span. In Phase I, we will design and build a one-axis positioner to demonstrate the dual-actuator. Anticipated Benefits: Rapid utlraprecision actuation is a key technology in all aspects of lithography. Nano lithography applications, important for commercial semiconductor fabrication, will benefit immediately from the techniques developed in this proposal. Speed of handling and therefore throughout will be enhanced.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Rugged, reliable, light weight Uninterruptable Power Supplies (UPS) are needed to protect critical C4I systems from power failure in the field environment. Commercially available UPS provide this protection but are prohibitively large and heavy. SatCon Technology Corporation proposes to develop an extremely small, light-weight Flywheel Uninterruptable Power Supply (FWUPS) for this application. This FWUPS would provide a solution to irregular voltages and frequencies, spikes, sags, surges, brownouts, and even blackouts that would normally result in loss of data or system crashes. The FWUPS will consist of a composite material flywheel with an integral motor generator making up the hub of the flywheel supported on frictionless magnetic bearings. A high effeciency electric drive accelerates and decelerates the FWUPS that can store more than 15 times the energy of a comparable weight battery. At a projected maximum rotation speed of 58,000 rpm, a 29.5 pound FWUPS module provides 15 minutes of energy at an output power level of 2Kw. This assumes the FWUPS spins down from full speed to half speed during discharge. A flywheel is superior to batteries or fuel cells in three important respects: 1) life, 2) hazardous material disposal, and 3) recharge time. In Phase I a state-of-the-art FWUPS will be designed, component research will be initiated, and the FWUPS concept will be tested. The Phase II program will complete the research together with the construction and test of a prototype system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         SatCon proposes to develop cost effective permanent magnet variable  speed drives (PM VSD's) for auxiliary applications on US Navy ships by  integrating high density drive electronics with innovative PM motor  designs to create a standardized set of rotating power modules with  common electrical and coolant interfaces.  SatCon will utilize its  recent experience in developing a very high power density electric  power train for the Chrysler Patriot hybrid electric race car with a  800-volt DC power distribution bus.  SatCon has designed high density  water cooled power inverters and a 500 -hp PM energy storage wheel for  this system.  Current PM VSD's, although more expensive than  across-the-line start induction motors of the same rating, are finding  many commercial applications where the benefits precise torque and  speed control and of higher power density outweigh the additional cost  and complexity.  Recent initiatives in the power distribution system  for Navy ships (Integrate Power System program) are leading to a DC bus  architecture which substantially mitigates the power electronics driven  cost disadvantage of PM VSD's versus across the line start induction  motors.  The reduction in startup power surge and the potential for  higher efficiency when delivering power to a variable load also offset  the additional cost of the PM VSD.  SatCon will study the cost  effectiveness and performance impact of introducing PM VSD technology  into ship board auxiliary systems and generate a preliminary PM VSD  design for a candidate ship board application.  Under Phase II SatCon  will generate detailed PM VSD's for several representative ship board  applications identified under Phase I.  Under Phase III a prototype of  a selected PM VSD design will be fabricated for ship qualification.",

We propose to use its PS-GVB code, a reliable and efficient general purpose ab initio electronicstructure program, together with a new finite element Poisson-Boltzmann (FEPB) solver to treat complexbiological systems in solution. During Phase I, we plan to increase the functionality of the PS-GVB-FEPBsoftware. These improvements will include the ability to perform analytical derivatives of the solvationenergy of large molecules and calculate pKa values. In Phase II, the software will be further expandedto allow it to carry out practical energy calculations for drugs binding to proteins.",

This technology would provide the basis for a new class of frequency-agile military range-imaging systems.  The proposed system would be comprised of a rapidly tunable laser transmitter, a scanning, direct-detection receiver and the necessary signal processing/display system.  The laser transmitter would derive its tunable infrared output from an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) pumped by a tunable Ti:sapphire laser.  The Phase I project would concentrate primarily on demonstrating the rapidly tunable OPO transmitter.  The critical subsystem technologies on which the overall system is based are:  an efficient, compact, high PRF, diode-pumped, green laser; a low-threshold, rapidly tunable, Ti:sapphire laser; a simple NCPM OPO, tunable via tuning of the pump only; and a patented methodology for constructing a tunable laser rangefinder.  The proposed system would have commercial and scientific applications in the area of optical remote sensing of aerosols, and when configured for differential absorption lidar, for the species-specific detection of atmospheric constituents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The overall objective of this effort is to develop all-solid-state pulsed driver technology to efficiency power plasma discharge sources used in IR countermeasures. The driver technology to be developed is based on high pulse rate Insulated Gate, Bipolar Transistors coupled with nonlinear magnetic pulse compression and new fractional-turn output transformer technology developed at SRL. The IGBTs act as a primary commutator and are used to switch the I joule of energy stored at 500 VDC in the primary energy storage capacitors to form 5 usec pulses. Two stages of nonlinear magnetic pulse compression and a fractional-turn output transformer are then employed to compress these pulses to the 20 kV/80 nsec pulses required to charge the peaking capacitors at the plasma discharge load. Circuitry will also be installed to increase the efficiency of coupling electrical energy to the rapidly varying load impedance represented by the plasma discharge. The all-solid-state driver will be designed to operate continuously at repetition rates up to 10,000 pulses per second and to have an operating lifetime of greater than 100 billion shots. In Phase I, Science Research Laboratory (SRL) will make the necessary modifications required to increase the pulse rate of an existing SCR-commutated copper vapor laser driver to 10,000 pps. These modifications will include replacement of the SCRs with IGBTs and upgrading the pulse compression modules, the thermal control systems and the driver trigger system. This modified driver will then be tested into a load circuit which simulates time-varying plasma discharge loads. The driver will be tested to full performance specifications and any performance deficiencies will be corrected. Phase I will culminate in the final engineering design of a prototype all-solid-state driver which will be fabricated and tested at SRL and then delivered to a selected Navy site in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Tritium is handled routinely at laboratories in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Europe.  There are several applications for nondestructive assay of solid tritium-contaminated samples including environmental clean-up, routine assay of tritium handling equipment, assay of fuel elements used by fusion reactors including the proposed ITER reactor, and routine monitoring of fission reactor core materials.  Present technologies for the assay of medium-level tritium-contaminated solid samples either require substantial sample preparation or rely on surface contamination alone.  Preparation of solid tritium-contaminated samples poses the problem of further contamination and thus should be avoided if possible.  The only method that offers high sensitivity, accuracy and safety is calorimetry.  Since the average energy of tritium decay is well known (+/- 0.3%), the level of contamination can be directly inferred from the nuclear heating of the contaminated material.  The sensitivity of the technique improves tremendously at low temperatures (8 degrees K).  Fortunately, these temperatures can be reached using mechanical refrigeration rather than liquid cryogens, reducing the complexity and cost of the final system.  The device envisioned would be fully automated with a sensitivity of 1.5mCi (0.6GBq), an accuracy of 0.3% and a production cost of less than $40,000.  In addition to the assay of tritium, this device could be used to assay other low-energy radioactive contamination.",

Unfortunately, however, the fact that today's message-passing systems are based entirely on the use of subprogram libraries, rather than on language-level constructs, makes them much harder to use than they should be, particularly when handling heterogeneous or unstructured data and computing environments. In this work we will develop suitable precompiler technology to handle many details of message-passing systems automatically, while still preserving the ability of sophisticated users to control the low-level details when that is required. We proposed to investigate language-level front-end systems that will interface with widely-used message-passing products like PVM or MPI to reduce the burden on users by providing, among other things: much cleaner and more intuitive syntax; semantic support for compile-time or link-time error checking; and automatic handling of many general situations at run time. ANTICIPATED BENERFITS: This project will lead to tremendously increased use of message-passing systems by making them much easier to use. By eliminating many programming complexities, compiler-level enhancements allow quicker development of programs that are more correct and run faster. Products based on this work will enable commercial and industrial firms to gain far greater benefit from parrallel computing, and to do so faster, with less-specially-trained personnel, and at far lower cost than with current library-based message-passing systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         An acoustic/ultrasonic sensor development program is proposed for non-invasive determination of the amount of scale in shipboard sewage pipes and fluid level in shipboard sewage tanks.  The technology is based on speed, attenuation, and scattering of vibrational waves (acoustic/ultrasonic/elastic) propagating in or through tanks and pipes are sensitive to the materials inside.  By measuring the characteristics of certain modes of propagation, we can sense thickness of scale in the pipe, or level of the fluid in a tank.  We divide the problem into two:  non-invasive tank level and non-invasive pipe scale measurements.  A sensor for the former, based on this technology, has already been developed by two of the principle investigators for measuring the fluid level in large petroleum tanks.  The proposed Phase I effort consists of four tasks to evaluate the feasibility of the approach, an analytic and an experimental task for each of the problems.  The analytical tasks are for determining the optimum modes of propagation and for predicting the wave speeds and attenuatioins under the various conditions.  The pipe related experimental task will test several acoustic/ultrasonic methods of measuring scale thickness.  The tank experimental task will test the capabilities of the existing sensor for gaging actual shipboard sewage tank levels.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal addresses the problem of mitigating the effect of unwanted structural modes of the V-22 aircraft on the performance of the flight control system. The current system designed by Bell Textron uses five nonself-adaptive filters in the frequency range of 2.3-5.5Hz on SAHRS and VYROS outputs and pilot stick control inputs to remove the effect of unwanted structural modes. The filter frequencies are scheduled with airspeed and conversion angle but not with respect to gross weight. The purpose of designing a self-adaptive notch filter is to compensate for changes in frequency due to effects such as gross weight and to achieve narrow filters with minimal phase lag. The use of a System Identification approach based on the Stochastic Realization Algorithm (SRA) is proposed. SRA has been shown to be very effective in estimating the parameters (frequencies, dampings, mode shapes) of structural modes of aircraft and flexible structures using measurement of outputs only. SRA does not require any special inputs and produces accurate results even with short data lengths and under poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) conditions. SRA has been tested on NASA flight test data from X-29 and F-18 and found to outperform other methods of structural mode parameter identification. The design of a self-adaptive notch filter using SRA results is based on a Kalman Filter. During Phase I, the feasibility of removing the unwanted effects of the structural modes using SRA-KF will be demonstrated on simulated and flight test data from the V-22 aircraft. Phase II will involve hardware/software integration and flight testing. Bell Textron, designer of structural filters for the V-22 flight control system is expected to support the proposed effort.

The goal of this proposal is to develop a laser that offers meets ALL of the requirments for a commercializable tunable source for WDM, including wide tuning range, precise channel spacing, low threshold, high output power, high-speed operation, wavelength stability under large signal modulation, thermo-electrically cooled, fiber coupled, hermetic package, and high reliability. To meet all these goals, we propose to develop a low-cost tunable semiconductor laser with a monolithically integrated electro-absorption modulator. The specifications of the laser will be chosen to be compatible with the needs defined by ARPA sponsored All-Optical Network testbeds. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: Completion of this proposal will enable the commercial intro of the first low cost tunable diode laser for WDM applications, spurring the practical development and deployment of boradband fiber optics communication networks. Applications include the envisioned dats superhighway and new broadband services such as interactive video, HDTV, multimedia, computer networks, and supercomputing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         \"Eighty percent of the cost of high volume optoelectronic components are in the package\" according to Bob Weissman of HP (Optics News, Aug 1993). To allow laser diodes to serve various markets, cost is a primary consideration. Given their present relatively high cost, laser diodes are not economical in many systems. The present high fabrication cost of laser diode sources is caused mainly by the cost of packaging, because of the variety of packages needed for each diode and application. In this proposal, SDL will utilize an economical universe packaging technology based on a versatile micro optical bench fabricated in silicon. The silicon optical benches can be fabricated at low cost and are easily adapted to many laser diode sources; the number of packaging components is greatly reduced and the resulting package is smaller and more robust. In Phase I of the program SDL will investigate the feasibilitgy of the technology by demonstrating the coupling of a laser diode to a single mode waveguide. In Phase II, the research will be extended, among others, to an individually addressable fiber coupled laser array on a Si optical bench. Merging existing laser diode technology and Si optical benches lowers individual unit cost and permits the use of laser diodes in a variety of useful commercial systems. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed Si optical bench technology will lead to an across the board reduction of cost of packaged laser diodes for markets including telecommunications, data storage, displays, sensing, printing, cutting and welding and medical lasers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         High power diode laser bars are critical components in diode-pumped solid-state laser systems. However, the output power from laser bars are limited to typically 20 W cw and 100 W qcw at commercial levels of reliability. SDL proposes a novel facet passivation approach that promises to increase the output power of laser bars by a factor of 2 to 3 beyond what is possible with current technology. Phase I will demonstrate the new design on test laser structures; Phase II will implement the process in laser diode bars and verify the performance improvement. Anticipated benefits include sharply increased reliability, lower cost, reduced input power, and reduced weight. Application areas include laser machining, welding, and solid state laser pumping. Additionally, single mode lasers in satellite communications, data storage, frequency conversion to mid-IR will be substantially improved.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         SDL, Inc. (formerly Spectra Diode Laboratories) proposes to develop a low-cost optical fiber amplifier for 1.3 um optical fiber systems. Although the development of 1.55 um Er-doped fiber amplifiers have revolutionized 1.55 um fiber communications, the vast majority of installed fiber systems is designed for 1.3 um transmission, and there is no existing fiber amplifier technology that can address this large installed base. SDL proposes to developed a 1.3 um fiber amplifier module based on Praeseodyniumdoped doped fluoride-based fibers and a unique high power semiconductor pump laser. The combination of these two technologies in a robust amplifier module enables the use of currently installed fiber for enormously expanded digital and analog services; including voice, video, and data transmission. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed fiber amplifier module will greatly expand the capabilities of existing 1.3 um fiber systems which inlucee the majority of all present telecommunications and CATV systems. Robust fiber amplifiers at 1.3 um withtheir low cross-talk and low distortion will enable high data rate communications (e.g., Wavelength Division Multiplexing), as well as high fan-out systems (e.g. 'fiber to-the-home) to be implemented using currently installed fiber.",

Military missions which require the extensive use of mines, anti-ship cruise missiles (HARPOON), land attack cruise missiles (TOMAHAWK) and torpedoes in conjunction with littoral operations tax existing assets of the United States and its Allies beyond their present hardware suite design capabilities. The most cost-effective method to address this issue is to embrace a concept of a \"Rapid Prototype\" portable Submarine Combat Control and Launch System. The \"Rapid Prototype\" system should be capable of use with a variety of Submarine launched weapons and delivery vehicles, from all types of Submarine platforms. Implementation of this concept can provide a low-cost alternative to the present method of Combat System development and deployment, where long lead times and large outlay costs restrict the ability of the United States and its Allies to rapidly respond to evolving world events in a timely manner. Developed technology could be used for underwater bridge, oil platform, sewer system, or ship hull inspections where the use of SCUBA divers would be unsafe or unsuitable.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Next-generation aircraft and space-based sensors will significantly benefit from a combined aperture multi-spectral passive (visible to LWIR) and active LADAR capability for enhanced target acquisition, ranging, tracking, and discrimination performance; and lower size, weight, power, and cost.  Typical DoD missions include advanced AWACS sensors; TMD and NMD interceptors and surveillance systems; cruise missile guidance/control; terrain mapping and photo-reconnaissance; laser guided missiles/weaponry; aircraft landing systems; laser secure links and environmental sensors.  The driving technology areas are ultra-lightweight all-reflective telescopes and wide field of regard (FOR), high precision pointing/stabilization control.  SSG's proposed concept includes (1) a very lightweight, all-reflective, off-axis, common shared aperture silicon carbide (SiC) telescope for combined, inherently aligned and a thermalized passive/active operation; and (2) a wide FOR, very precise and compact pointer with internal stabilization control.  The proposed hardware must satisfy visible level performance under stressing thermal and vibration environments. SSG is proposing a highly innovative SiC process technology that provides very fracture tough (drop on cement floor) and extremely highly damped (50 times better than a metal) structural assembly at very low cost, which is critical for stressing aircraft and rocket applications.  The wide FOR pointer uses a meridional 2-axis mirror assembly (size is independent of the large azimuthal angular extent), and a highly innovative fringe counting optical encoder capable of less then 0.5 microrad accuracy, repeatability, and jitter control over the large angular extent.  Phase I will develop a combined aperture passive/active sensor concept with supporting analyses and critical technology assessment; Phase II will be a hardware demonstration of critical technology area(s) in a \"flight-worthy\" configuration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Present day strained layer multi-quantum well (SLMQW) lasers are limited in wavelength to about 2.1 um. Longer wavelengths require thin layers whose \"critical thickness\" for dislocation-free strain begin to approach atomic dimensions due to the use of a binary (e.g. InP) substrate. We propose to use bulk ternary InAsyP1-y substrates which have larger atomic spacing thus allowing longer wavelength operation. In Phase I we will deposit strained layers of InGaAs and InAsP upon a bulk grown InAs .1P.9 substrate and demonstrate and deliver a ridge-waveguide laser at 2.3 um. In Phase II we will work with Crystallod, Inc., (a new substrate manufacturer) to fabricate InAsyP1-y (Y + 0.4) and InzGa1-zSb (.1 < z < .3) substrates to push the wavelength of strained layer antimonide-based lasers out past 3 microns. Dr. Ramon U. Martinelli of SRI David Sarnoff Research Center will consult. A Phase I extension option is included.",

The system will employ a resolution enhancement technique that will provide rapid quantitative submicron surface deposit and surface roughness measurements on semiconductor wafers. The system will be capable of resolving vertical heights and lateral widths less than 100 Angstroms and have a working distance greater than 10 cm in air or vacuum.  In addition, the system will be able to provide and identification \"signature\" for different materials deposited on the wafer surface.  The scanned image of the wafer will provide sharp delineation between surface steps, scratches, and particles whether insulating or metallic.  With the rapid response and long working distance, the system can be used for in-process wafer evaluations.  Coupled with the systems capability to identify deposits on the wafer surface, the electronically enhanced optical data can lead to analyses through SPA to directly control the processing of silicon wafers in production environments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Real time hardware channel simulators are critical elements in the design, debug and testing of communication systems. Signatron has for over 20 years been a pioneer and leading developer of channel simulators for a wide range of special purposes, including radar, sonar, and Satellite, microwave, troposcatter, HF, and meteor scatter communications. The objective of the proposed effort is to provide a new hardware simulation capability that can, in effect, operate faster than real time by using Importance Sampling (IS) techniques to artificially emphasize error-generating events. Signatron has used IS in many radar and communications computer simulations and has identified the key issues affecting faithfulness of the simulation, particularly the difficult issues relating to the hardware simulation. While IS simulation is relatively simple for memoryless systems, it is less efficient, and generally more complicated, for the most common case of systems with memory. A novel approach for adapting the IS simulator to a system, and solving the problems with unknown delay with memory, is proposed. The Phase I effort will study the implementation issues and a validation methodology. A general purpose additive noise simulator design will be developed and the extension to multiplicative (fading) systems will be evaluated using IS techniques already developed at Signatron. The specification for the Phase II advanced development will be developed to meet the widest range of military and commercial applications possible.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The principal objective of this proposed effort is to develop a generic sensor for real-time verification of bonding integrity of materials at the micro-level, which include but are not limited to ball bonds, wedge bonds, solder joints, internal and external delamination of traces & lid sealing of microcircuit packages. As demonstrated in the following proposal, this will be a non-contact sensor with high speed, sensitivity and precision specifically for performing detection of micro-detachment of joining materials. The backbone of this technological thrust is base on recent development of illumin-optics technology for microelectronics by Simpex and laser ultrasonic technology by Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Department of Energy. The measurement of the bond integrity of balls and wedges is accomplished through a non-contact method by using lasers for both generation and detection of ultrasonic waves passing through the bond. Simply, our Micro Laser Ultrasonic Optical Sensor represents an automation of the classical \"tap test\" in which an object is struck in some fashion and an experienced listener determines the adhesion integrity from the sound generated. This technique is much improved from the traditional ultrasonic/acoustic technique. The object need not be contacted, the excitation is much gentler than that required in a contact test, and the whole approach lends itself to automation. Anticipated Benefits: This effort will provide a strong foundation for high resolution and high speed sensors for determining attachment integrity of micro-dimensional material layers. This technology can be adapated to numerous applications such as thick film & thin film, deposition processes for microelectronics, joining of metals and other joining processes with unknown micromechanical properties. These sensors will help reduce scrap, down time, eliminate many manual inspection steps, save time and money,and increase quality.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         An innovative approach is proposed to improve management decision-making in the development and support of mission-critical software systems.  This effort will define a management metrics decision system that will support both metrics process setup and in-process decision support.  Innovative aspects include using an open tool architecture to facilitate environment integration, rule-based technology and experience-based case histories to represent the user-extensible knowledge-base of decision alternatives, and management game playing to support both user training and expert decision capture.  We also propose an innovative program postmortem analysis capability to augment the game playing decision capture and to capture \"20-20\" handsight assessments of the decisions made and possible alternatives.  Phase I objectives target three challenges in the realization of the envisioned system:  (1) address management decisions that relate to metrics process setup and tailoring; (2) use nonobtrusive knowledge capture techniques to support ver-extensibility of the knowledge-base of decision alternatives; and (3) provide intuitive, user-friendly application of the knowledge-base, in conjunction with measurement data and metrics analysis results, to support decision-making.  Phase I will investigate solutions to these challenges and define the Phase II development approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The need for versatile and economic industrial scale technologies for culturing anchorage-dependent mammalian cells is becoming more evident. This is a result of the increasing demand for vaccines and the use of mammalian cells for some of the new, emerging biopharmaceuticals. Microcarrier beads in bioreactor systems are being applied as a large scale production method. SoloHill is developing a family of unique microcarrier products which are superior to those currently available. The overall aim is to develop a novel small microcarrier bead (38-63 micrometers) which will foster the aggregation of cells. This will encourage the use of microcarriers for conditions where higher cell densities have been shown to be advantageous. Specifically we will (l) demonstrate that higher cell densities can be achieved under conditions where extensive clumping occurs. We will characterize the bead-to-bead clumps on small (less than 63 micrometers) and large (150-212 micrometers) beads. And, we will (2) demonstrate that cells maintained under conditions of high cell density on clumped beads are metabolically active and produce higher levels of useful products including infectious virus than cells grown under conventional conditions (in which clumping is minimized).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Environmental monitoring of trace gas species is becoming an increasingly important area of concern for both private and government sectors.  Desirable characteristics for such sensors include portability, low power requirements, high sensitivity, rapid response and low maintenance.  A semiconductor laser based sensor can meet all of these requirements.  Recent advances in semiconductor laser technology have produced lasers which have better mode quality, improved tunability, increased output powers and a wider range of wavelengths (particularly in the near-IR and visible regions).  We are proposing to build a laser diode based system for continuous emissions monitoring of NO2[sub] and Oxygen which shall take advantage of these recent technological advances. Phase I research will concentrate on optimizing the technique for measurement of NO2[sub].  A diode laser-based sensor for simultaneous measurement of multiple gases will be designed for subsequent development and field testing in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Jet engines and other turbine combustors operate at high pressures, with turbulence length and time scales on the order of 100 um and 100 us.  Accurate experimental characterization of turbulent reacting flows is critical for validating computational fluid dynamics and chemistry codes used in the design of advanced turbine combustors.  Laser-based diagnostics are typically used to characterize velocity, temperature, and concentrations of key chemical species in flames.  However, most diagnostics in current use are not capable of resolving all of the time and length scales of interest.  We propose to develop new diagnostic tools and techniques that take advantage of the characteristics of high-power, ultrashort pulse, mode-locked Ti:sapphire lasers. Phase I emphasis will be placed on the development of a spatially resolved pump-probe absorption technique to determine absolute number densities of the free radical CH, a key trace species in flames.  Further Phase I work will study the use of picosecond degenerate-four-wave-mixing (DFWM) for CH number density measurements.  This background-free technique promises to have greater sensitivity than absorption based techniques.  Measurement of OH and NO using these techniques will require the third harmonic of Ti:sapphire.  Determining the design for laser systems to measure these trace species will lay the foundation for the Phase II effort.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The High Precision Cavity Radiometer is an all digital dual cavity radiometer with a 600-fold increase in sensitivity over current cavity radiometers. This new detector is being proposed for use in two applications: (1) as a spaceborne sensor and (2) as a commercial laboratory instrument. First, the TUVIR (Total and Ultra-Violet Irradiance Radiometer) is a completely new spaceborne instrument which utilizes the new radiometer to measure the total solar radiation and the ultraviolet solar radiation in narrow, ozone related bands. The 200 to 250 nm ultraviolet component of the sun's radiation provides the energy for the formation of ozone in the Earth's atmosphere. This narrow spectral band only contains 0.14% of the total solar energy. To accurately monitor long term changes in this radiation a 600 fold improvement in sensitivity is required over current cavity radiometers. TUVIR provides this sensitivity. Second, commercial laboratory radiometers with greatly improved sensitivity are also required to accurately measure the output power of low level continuous wave lasers and to act as transfer standards from cryogenic calibration standards that operate in vacuum chambers. This High Precision Cavity Radiometer has the long term precision and absolute accuracy to provide a transportable reference standard with a durable shelf life.",

The unique aspects of this proposal are the usage of advanced composite materials and thermal management (TM) technology to minimize the IR signature of the exhaust component and the integration with an existing component design from Lockheed Advanced Development company.  Advanced composite materials and TM technology will be used in the redesign of an available advanced functional suppressor component design which is presently made from metal. The proposed study includes:  1) a redesign of the suppressor materials based on the functional requirements and a proven design configuration; 2) a parmetric analytical assessment of the impact of the modifications on the thermal performance and IR signature of the modifications on the thermal performance and IR signature of the component and aircraft; 3) an assessment of the fabricability, maintainability and reliability of the design; and 4) the assembly of a technology development plan.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Electro-optical and infrared (EOIR) technologies originally developed for night-vision systems and sensor counter-countermeasure applications are applied to the remote detection, analysis, and identification of uniquely prepared materials. The benefit of this unusual merging of technologies is to significantly improve passive IFF capabilities for certain military uses, and to make this powerful remote-sensing tool affordable for a wide variety of civil applications. Materials constructed with unique spectrally-selective optical properties are proposed that allow narrow-band \"color signatures\" to be created such that only the properly equipped sensors can \"see\" them. Materials previously developed are described, and means for adapting them to the MWIR thermal spectrum for this application are proposed for phase-1. Advanced materials for operation in harsh environments are proposed for development during subsequent phases 2 and 3. Our years of accumulated experience in developing complex focal-plane assemblies (FPAs) is applied to the creation of integral detector-readout spectrometer devices that significantly reduce the cost of high-performance hyperspectral sensors making them affordable for law-enforcement, counter narcotics, counter terrorist, shipment tracking, and various industrial process uses. A breadboard remote sensing system will be demonstrated during phase-1, and a \"road map\" to a final modular self contained sensor is proposed for phase-2 and phase-3.",

This is based On extensive development and testing of a series of new visible light photoinitiators, compounds which form reactive intermediates with visible light. These initiators are versatile and can be formulated in most radiation curable coatings - acrylates such as polyolacrylates, epoxy acrylates, silicon acrylates and urethane acrylates; unsaturated polyesters such as those used to coat particle board and as structural reinforced construction materials; and epoxies such as bis-phenyl-A-epoxide. Formulations of the initiators are infinitely stable in the dark, contain no volatile organic solvents, andcan be easily brushed on the surfaces to be coated. Curing is on demand; i.e, when thesurface is irradiated with light from a visible source. Alternatively, sunlight maybe used but the irradiation period depends on dose. The objective of Phase I is to (1)develop formulations of pigmented coatings suitable for marine applications;(2) evaluate initiator formulations such that the formulations can be cured with visible sources to a known depth; (3) develop the evaluation procedures for salt fog tests, impact tests, pencil hardness tests, and adherence tests; (4) establish which surface treatments enhance adhesion and (5) set up test protocols to routinely evaluate each.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Weapon system effectiveness studies require the utilization of both low and high-level models and simulations.  Often the data for these models are not compatible.  A large part of the analysis process is spent extracting, assimilating, and transforming output data of one model into the compatible formats for input to other models.  Previous approaches include manually modifying the source code to accommodate the appropriate formats or building model-specific post processors.  These methods require a code change or translator for each model-to-model pair and are not cost effective.  Furthermore, current methods don't accommodate version upgrades or new models, and lack the ability to efficiently aggregate model data.  Spectra * Research proposes to develop the model Integration through Data Aggregation and Semantics (MIDAS) system.  MIDAS will provide a methodology for automatically extracting, classifying, transforming, and sharing model data.  S*R will extend the semantic code analyzer software being developed under current SBIR programs for the Army and NASA, to provide automated analysis and classification of data requirements for FORTRAN models.  MIDAS will also provide features so that analysis data can be incorporated into office automation software.  S*R will prototype key MIDAS components and processes during Phase I.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of Phase I is to establish the feasibility of building and utilizing a diode laser-based instrument for combined photodynamic therapy (PDT) and laser hyperthermia treatment of malignant tumors. Use of PDT in conjunction with laser hyperthermia to treat cancerous tissue offers potential advantages over PDT alone. The proposed diode laser instrument would provide optical power at two different wavelengths (separately or simulataneously), one in the red (690 nm) for PDT and the other in the near-infrared (~800 nm) for laser hyperthermia. The instrument would incorporate two monolithic, independent, linear arrays of high efficiency, state-of-the-art, strained-layer, quantum well lasers each coupled to a common fiber-optic delivery system. Unlike present commercially available argon-pumped dye lasers, which are extremely large, inefficient, and expensive, the proposed laser system will be sufficiently small, portable, and cost-effective to permit easy installation and operation in hospitals and clinics. The prototype instrument will be evaluated by conducting combined PDT and laser hyperthermia on mouse tumors at the Massachusetts General Hospital's Wellman Laboratories of Photomedicine. Anticipated Benefits: Successful Phase I and Phase II programs would lead to commercialization of a highly versatile instrument for either separate or combined photo-dynamic therapy and laser hyperthermia treatments. The envisioned diode-laser-based system would be extremely compact and portable, and could be sold profitably at a fraction of the cost of existing laser systems with similar treatement capability.",

The new detector willreduce assembly complexity by obviating the need for precise stacking of photodiodes on the scintillator.In Phase I, we will demonstrate a single-element integrated X-ray detector with improved signal.CdTe/CdS photodiode structures will be deposited directly on the scintillator by a low-cost thermalevaporation technique. The detector will be tested using a diagnostic X-ray source. During Phase II, wewill design and fabricate a detector array and determine the potential of these integrated X-ray detectorsfor X-ray computed tomography.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Plasma dynamics and plasma-surface interactions are central to many thin film deposition processes, but in spite of their importance, are not well understood theoretically or empirically.  There has been even less study of the plasma deposition physics of the high-bandgap nitrides GaN, AlN, InN, and their alloys, which are becoming increasingly important in electronic applications.  Spire proposes to study thin-film nitride deposition from an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) driven plasma; plasma modeling will be performed by Process Analysts, Inc (PAI).  In Phase I, Spire's ECR plasma reactor, which ha already demonstrated thin film deposition of InxGa1-xN alloys, will be instrumented with plasma diagnostics, and a series of nitride depositions will be conducted using metalorganic (MO) sources of the Group III metals and nitrogen.  PAI will modify an existing finite-element model of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) to account for ECR plasma heating, magnetic anisotropy, and MO sources.  The deposition model will predict the effects of plasma parameter changes on thin-film deposition.  Good Phase I results would lead to Phase II in which refined plasma diagnostics will be installed and operated on the ECR plasma reactor to gain in-depth understanding of volume and surface processes during plasma deposition.  Plasma modeling will be extended to include effects of non-uniform plasma heating, magnetic field effects on transport, and more complete cross-sections to better model the plasma chemistry.  Phase III will see early commercialization of nitride deposition service and reactor sales by Spire, and sales by PAI of software predicting deposition parameters; this software could be made part of a feedback control system for the ECR plasma reactor to assure uniform, reproducible, thin-film deposition in a production setting.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Ultralight III-V solar cells are proposed to extend the mission duration of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs).  Silicon panels used with an already flying UAV have panel power densities of 400 W/kg, using 15% AM0 thin (110 um) silicon cells.  Here we propose using even thinner (8 um), higher efficiency (25% AM0), InGaP/GaAs tandem cells, bonded to thin coverglasses, to greatly increase the cell power density.  Cells are first fabricated on thicker substrate wafers, and these wafers are later removed once the cells are bonded to thin (3 mil) CMG coverglasses.  Panel power densities almost four times greater (1500 W/kg) than that offered by silicon should result from the higher efficiency and much lighter weight of the proposed cells.  In Phase I, single-junction (10% AM0) GaAs cells would be made and bonded to 3 mil CMG coverglass with RTV adhesive.  The substrates would then be removed with a selective etch.  The wafer backs would then be metalized, and completed cells would be available at the end of Phase I for evaluation.  In Phase I, a design study would also be performed to identify the best technology (e.g. adhesives vs. electrostatic bonding, epitaxial liftoff vs. selective etching) to pursue in Phase II.  In Phase II, tandem cells would be made, and the technology identified as best in the Phase I study would be developed in a process suitable for large areas and high-volume manufacturing.",

This project is important because it reaches an ever-growing number of patients who are at a critical decision-making juncture regarding their medical treatment options. This informational package will help them make informed treatment decisions by encouraging an on-going dialogue with physicians and family members. The videotape helps patients to recognize that myths and fears can be investigated and overcome, rather than allowed to become barriers to effective treatment and prevention efforts. In Phase I, State of the Art, with nationally recognized medical advisors, will produce a script, creative plan, and storyboards for the video, and a draft of the accompanying brochure. These materials will be reviewed for medical accuracy and patient relevancy by the project physician advisors. Three focus groups of prostate cancer patients and their family members will test the material to ensure it meets its patient education goals. The package will be completed in Phase II and distributed through bulk sales to pharmaceutical manufacturers for distribution to doctors' offices. National prostate cancer organizations will also distribute the package to patients who call requesting information.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The goal of this proposed research is to prove the feasibility of a software solution to provide intelligent tutoring for the REGIS Training Center. Because students often learn best by example, we intend to design a tutoring system around example problems. We will apply the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) to elicit and represent the example problems (or cases) and provide explanations to students on problem solving techniques. The system would be sensitive to a student\\'s knowledge o problem solving principles and tailor the teaching sessions accordingly. The body of knowledge contained in the system could be expanded over time simply through addition of more problems. An intelligent tutoring system is an exciting supplement to traditional classroom instruction. It offers the possibility of individualized teaching and allows the student to work at his own pace, somewhat mitigating the problems of staff cutbacks and increasing complexity of subject area. In Phase I, we will design a generic intelligent tutoring system using a case-based reasoning paradigm. The feasibility of the system will be proven through implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype in a specific domain.",

With the advent of numerous friendly and threat and neutral forces operating in the world, the task of consistently classifying numerous acoustic targets has become extremely difficult. Acoustic Intelligence data on hundreds of target types is impossible to memorize or quickly reference. Operators need a passive acoustic data classification tactical decision aid which can help them reference important parametric data and assist in accurate and timely classification of the targets. This proposed effort will research and develop a design for a Passive Acoustic Classification (Computer) System with a robust acoustic parameters data base and algorithms to query the data base, score the results of data base matches using math algorithms, and interact with the operator/analyst in reaching timely and accurate target classification.",

The range of 500 to 5,000 Vdc will be used in evaluating voltage level performance when connected to the micro SMES.  In this proposed phase I effort, a matrix will be made to indicate the possible combinations of coil voltages and currents, inverter dc voltage levels and capacities, and dc-to-dc converters. Criteria such as predicted reliability, ease of up-and-down sizing to different power levels (modularity), efficiency, physical size and weight, ease of production and cost will be used to select an optimal design of the dc-to-dc interface.  A report will be produced detailing this work.",

Associated with each memory function is a Data Processor with a Cache Memory and a Knowledge Base for the memory. The Processors provide the system control, verify input and output data, identifies and classifies the data words and controls the transfer of data between the RDM and the DDM on separate Input and Output Ports. The Knowledge Base (KB) function will aid the processors in data identity and classification plus other system functions. The System will be modular which will allow the system to grow or retract to meet operating requirements and system loading. A data archiving function will be included for storage of data that is not memory resident. Parallel Distributed Processing allow Real-Time access to current Input Data words.",

A variable group III element source flux would provide agile vertical layer composition control required for sophisticated device fabrication. One recent source concept, Linear Motion Oven or LIMO, appears especially promising for this application.  It has been demonstrated to achieve fast large flux variation and flux transient reduction, thereby significantly improving the layer composition control.  We propose to incorporate flux sensor ion the lIMO design so that the flux can be accurately measured and adjusted in real time.  Long term cell drift may also be corrected. We will build a prototype Smart LIMO based on modeling results, evaluate its performance, and perform actual device fabrication to validate its utility.  Such a source would enable higher quality electronic and photonic devices to be fabricated for DoD and commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Improvements in liquid lubricant performacne and life are required for the AIPS advanced military diesel engine. At the 340 degree F oil sump temperature of this engine, the antiwear/anti-oxidant additives in most AIPS candidate lubricants are rapidly decomposed. Several additive functions are thus lost. This can result in severe bearing wear and corrosion, high overhead wear, rapid loss of base number and sludge deposits that plug oil filters and turbocharger oil feel lines. Surfaces Research has developed novel antiwear/anti-oxidant additives with superior high-temperature stability and effectiveness. These additives can potentially replace less stable additives in all AIPS lubricant formulations. The major Phase I activities will be synthesis of the new additives and determination of their tribological performance, oxidation-corrosion performance, and compatibility with other additives in a full diesel engine formulation. The best new additive and full formatulation will be delivered. A small feasibility demonstration in Phase I will address a separate issue. We will contribute to improved performance of an engine demonstrator with extreme upper cylinder temperatures by demonstrating new Surfaces Research solid lubricant technology. A new solid lubricatn coating will be delivered.",

Chemical modulators of these receptors have a variety of potential therapeutic applications,including treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypertension, pain and glaucoma. Although sixalpha adrenoceptor subtypes are now known, little information is available concerning the locations andphysiological functions of these subtypes in the body. The three-dimensional structures of thesereceptors, and the chemical nature of their interactions with ligands are also poorly understood. Ligandswere identified by our cloned human receptor screening program which bind selectively to individualalpha adrenoceptor subtypes. In Phase I, some of these compounds will be used as templates for thedesign of new pharmacological tools. These tools will include molecules that selectively inactivate onesubtype by covalent modification, as well as subtype-selective radioligands. In Phase I and II, these newpharmacological tools will be used to determine the localization and functional capabilities of the differentalpha adrenergic subtypes in various human and animal tissues. These tools will also be useful forstructural characterization of the receptor-ligand complexes. Information obtained in these studies willaid the identification of new therapeutic opportunities and the design of new drugs.",

Each reducer stage has a drive cam track cut into an input drive disk and a driven cam track cut into a output driven disk. The rotating drive track rotates the driven track via balls traveling in slots of a grounded reaction disk. All balls work simultaneouly at constant velocity and torque throughput: micro torque ripple, increased bandwidth, high stiffness. The rolling balls minimize heat generation, while the flat disks maximize heat dissipation. Axial preloading accomodates thermal, environmental, wear effects, extends lifetime, and cooperate with flat disks for zero backlash and high precision. High volumetric and operational efficiency. Expanded envelope. Robust with low compliance. Cams formed in face of flat disks for lower cost manufacturing. Fabricate in metals, ceramics. No maintenance ceramic disks. Many commercial applications: substitute for conventional gear of planetary assemblies or harmonic drives. Anticipated Benefits: High precision, high efficiency, rotary drive units for speef reduction and control in commercial, industrial, manufacturing and processing equipment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Mission planning system operators need better ways of interacting with their systems.  This includes more efficient man-machine dialog and better physical interface devices and interaction techniques.  The proposed research effort will result in the development of the Multi-Model Mission Planning System Interface (M3PI).  This system will integrate voice recognition and eye-tracking as a separable component that can be fully integrated with existing and future mission planning systems.  The Phase I effort will produce a system design and a demonstration of integrated voice/eye interaction for a mission planning problem as well as a full development plan for both ground-based and airborne (in cockpit) M3PI systems.  The Phase II effort will develop the M3PI on a UNIX workstation and will interface to a ground-based mission planning system.  Further development (e.g., during Phase III) will be oriented toward extending the functionality of the M3PI to enable airborne real-time mission planning and replanning support, developing a portable voice/eye interaction application programming interface (API), and re-packaging the system for delivery as a workstation/PC add-in board.  This voice/eye system can be used in a wide variety of applications that emphasize use of emerging non-command-based interaction such as virtual reality and agent-based user interfaces.  Moreover, the technology will augment conventional command-based HCI technologies that support hands-busy applications and applications for the physically challenged.",

Object-MBM will be designed to follow the COBRA standard of the OMG.  We will also build \"interface layers\" to make Object-MBM totally modular, scalable, and independent of the operating systems of the underlying computing environment.  The second module will facilitate real-time distribution of objects to all the computers in the heterogeneous network.  At SYSTRAN, we provide solutions using a family of real-time replicated share-memory networking product know as SCRAMNet.  We will incorporate some of the real-time networking protocols from SCRAMNet in this Program and develop IR-DOMS.  We will also build GUI through which the users can interface with IR-DOMS.",

These FBL systems offer opportunities in improved safety with immunity to electromagnetic interference, electrical isolation, no cross-talk between cables, greater transmission bandwidth, and greater transmission security. Other benefits include weight savings, reducndancy, better reliability, and potential design simplification. Various modular approaches will be investigated for alternate protocols, topologies and network standars. Of particular interst is the development of highly reliable, low-cost FBL sytems using modular approaches. The applications of nonlinear optical polymer devices to FBL systems will be determined. During the proposed work design factors will be considered in providing a design for a PHase II breadboard. Also, we expect to work closely with Lear Astronics, a world leader in VMS and digital flight controls for the development of the proposed technology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The development of large dynamic range, linear response optical transmitters would allow significantly lower cost lasers to be used in many microwave analog data links for video, sensor, and optoelectronic signal/image processing in phased array applications.  Our approach will decrease the distortions caused by second and third order harmonics of a signal and by cross modulation with other signals in the laser transmitter. Multi-function phased array antennas require low loss, high dynamic range RF/microwave transport from the array elements to image processing receiver electronics located many motors from the antenna.  This type of application finds an excellent fit with fiber optic links when the laser transmitter and optical processing receiver provide low noise, wide- bandwidth high dynamic operation and the connecting fiber provides low thermal coefficient of delay.  TACAN proposes a novel broadband high power, low chirp laser link with high dynamic range to support command, control, communications, and intelligence (C31) systems for transporting up to 5 GHz signal spectra with high SNR and extremely low distortion.",

These needs are increasingly being addressed with immunoassays specific of individual analytes or for restricted chemical classes.  The sensitivity, selectivity, and cost of standard assay kits has earned wide acceptance for this approach. Relatively recently, some immunosassay for chemically hazardous materials such as pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and petroleum hydrocarbons have become commercially available.  Our work will combine immunoassay techniques with evanescent-wave fiber-optic fluorescence spectroscopy to fabricate a continuously operating sensor.  The ability of evanescent-wave spectorscopy to discriminate between fluorescent molecules on the surface of the fiber probe and those in the bulk solution eliminates the need for a washing step.  Our work will combine the picomolar sensitivity of previously demonstrated fiber-optic immunoassays with a semipermeable membrane to contain the immunoreagents in a continuously operating probe.  This type of sensor will, therefore, retain the advantages of selectivity and sensitivity offered by immunoassay.  The capability ot function as a continuously operating probe while retaining this level of performance, however, opens up significantly new opportunities not offered by any existing technology.",

This technology is based on the developemnt of wavelength stable semiconductor diode lasers. With this technology, an array of wavelength stable lasers can be used to communicate on multiple wavelength simultaneously. The proposed approach can have a very large bandwidth, is adaptable to many protocols, can interface to fiber-optic systems, and car be implemented for novel secure wavelength-hopping communciations systems. There are numerous applications of this technology. For example, in the communications arena our approach can provide hundreds of non-interfering wavelenths for dense wavelength division multiplexing for private/secure communications and noninterfereing wireless communications links. Applications exist in terrestrial and satellite free-space communications links as well as fiber-optic communications links. The very large bandwidth of our approach allows gigabit to terabit/sec wireless communications technology. Anticipated Benefits: Applications include personal communciations networks, satellite communications, and optical line-of-sight communications as an alternate to microwave line-of-sight communications. Moreover, our stable laser technology will facilitate stabilized diode-laser-pumps for solid-state lasers that can operate over a wide temperature range, wavelength-stable lasers for coherent communications, optical memories, dense wavelength division multiplexing fiber-optic communications systems, and rangefinders.",

A thin strut fuel injection module will be designed and manufactured in this project.  This fuel injector concept is a low aspect ratio version of the existing High Aspect Ratio Ramp Injector (HARRI). Previous testing performed by Taitech, Inc. indicates that the HARRI suffers from the high pressure loss and poor mixing typical of highspeed combustion systems.  The proposed thin strut ramp will have a smooth front edge to reduce the pressure gradient and vorticity.  Pressure, temperature, Mach number, and concentration will be surveyed two-dimensionally by the diagnostic systems developed by Taitech, Inc.  Three-dimensional CFD simulations will be used to investigate mixing behavior.  The Phase I study will combine an experimental program and a 3-D CFD simulation to shorten the engineering and development time for this new injector module for the NASP propulsion system.  The technologies that will be prepared for commercialization include the efficient ejector system and the 3-D CFD analysis capability for NASP and other propulsion systems.",

Approximately 10%of these individuals become symptomatic and develop colitis and liver abscess with a mortality rate ofmore than 40,000 persons each year. The current method of diagnosis is the microscopic visualizationof the organism in fecal specimens. However, this method requires extensive experience, is tedious,and may not be accurate if not performed within minutes of collecting the specimen. In addition, it doesnot distinguish nonpathogenic and pathogenic strains. This project will evaluate the use of monoclonalantibody-based ELISAs designed to detect the presence of the organism in fecal specimens and todistinguish nonpathogenic from pathogenic strains. The ELISAs are based on the use of monoclonalantibodies that bind specifically to the galactose adhesion of the organism. The project will optimize theELISA as a diagnostic test and begin to analyze fecal specimens as well as liver biopsy and serumspecimens for the presence of E.Histolytica antigen. Results will be correlated with microscopy resultsand with zymodeme analysis. The ELISA tests should be useful as diagnostic aids and will make thediagnosis more efficient and cost-effective.",

The system will make use of several modalities to improve combined spatial resolution and selectivity for detecting and imaging aquifers, LNAPLs and DNAPOLs.  To accomplish a broader spectrum of characterization needs, the proposed approach will use various imaging and sampling techniques for three stages of interrogation range and spatial resolution.  A first stage will be noninvasive and maximally safe and will use surface seismic and surface electromagnetic imaging methods for planning the second stage soil penetration.  A second stage will use both seismic and electromagnetic imaging methods integrated into a cone penetrometer system.  THe penetrometer will avoid penetration of the aquifer by using aquifer depth information obtained form the first stage proceedure.  A third stage of analysis will use an integrated cone mounted radar and sonar look ahead systems and a laser fluorscense material identification subsystem.  Plase I work will include studies of these systems, computer modeling of the seismic and electromagnetic imaging subsystems and initial laboratory studies using a 64 electrode electromagnetic resistivity imaging system.",

Integration of the proposed sensor into a PC based contiuous monitoring system would result in the ability to provide early warning of potectial seal failures for compressors, valves, pumps, flanges, and other piping facilities which might cause fugitive emissions.  During the proposed Phase I effort, TechnoLink will demonstrate the applicability of this technology be developing system level performance requirements and conducting prototype testing.  The successful completion of Phase I will result in a system level design specification.  Completion of Phases II & III will yield a commercially available VOC monitoring system that will benefit both the Federal Government and private industry by eliminating the need to perform time consuming manual inspections and allowing the prediction of incipient failures.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The proposed research examines the feasibility of using solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) for shipboard electric power generation by substituting new ceramic anode materials able to operate with logistic fuels. These anodes would allow the SOFC to operate witha range of reformed fuels containing sulfur impurities (including coal derived fuel gas, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and natural gas), avoiding the cost and space requirements of fuel pre-processing. The Navy is evaluating the feasibility of using fuel cell technology for various electric power generation applications on surface ships including auxiliary service and eventually, propulsion. The operating characteristics of fuel cell systems, particularly the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), are an attractive alternative to the gas turbine generator. Experiments will focus on identifying and formulating potential anode compositions that incorporate the use of mixed conducting materials, test them for total conductivity, stability, and sulfur tolerance using resistance measurmeents and XRD analysis. Promising materials will then be tested in IRF single cells with sulfur-containing fuel to show the feasibility of sulfur-tolerant SOFC operation. Anticipated Benefits: Demonstrating the feasibility of using sulfur tolerant anodes in single cell fuel cells in Phase I will permit further development and optimization in Phase II of sulfur tolerant anode materials and fabrication techniques and multi-cell IRF SOFC stack testing. Phase III will initiate prototype system development.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The need for a reconfigurable, affordable, DIS compatible Combat Vehicle Simulator is immediate. The training needs of the Army Reserve and National C3uard (ARNG) are unique, ARNG personnel operate actual equipment infrequently and therefore have little opportunity to maintain proficiency in basic skills. Some might perceive that proficiency training has become less critical as a result of the new technologies, but this is not the case. For every technology based advantage provided, there is an added training requirement. Additionally, the ARNG utilizes a variety of vehicles, such as the MlAl, MlA2, M2AI, M2A2, CEV, and others. The training needs of the ARNG center upon the mastery of sophisticated systems in a dynamic, complex environment. A comprehensive reconfigurable system must address all of these factors. Development of a low cost Reconfigurable Combat Vehicle Simulator (RCVS) is proposed. This system will be reconfigurable across vehicle types and training applications to support a broad range of training requirements. The underlying concept is targeted to provide a capability that supports both narrow purpose training requirements (such as home based desktop training) and unconstrained vehicle simulation within the DIS environment. This will allow a single system to meet the needs of most Armories, exploit reusable subsystems (such as DIS interfaces), and simplify the procurement and fielding process. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Reconfigurable Simulation Technology will be able to be applied in a wide range of both military and commercial applications. The proposed capability will benefit the nation because, for the first time, it will be cost effective to provide a comprehensive, multi-task, multi-echelon capability to Armories in sufficient quantities to have a substantive impact on the ARNG readiness.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Weapon system components such as electromechanical or hydraulic servos, valves, or gears often exhibit deadzone, backlash, or hysteresis behavior caused by stiction, magnetism, or other phenomena.  These nonlinear features can strongly influence or dominate system response in many situations.  Feedback control laws for such systems must manage the impact of these types of nonlinearities on system performance.  However, it is frequently difficult to characterize these nonlinear effects precisely, and this hinders the design of effective control laws.  In this proposal we describe a design methodology for the robust, adaptive feedback control of systems with backlash, hystereses, and deadzones.  We shall investigate the tradeoffs in complexity between classical robust control methods (Hinfinity control) and parametric adaptive control methods.  The adaptive control methodology is based on the use of (adaptive) inverses for the nonlinear phenomena (backlash, hysteresis, and deadzones) and adaptive update laws for the linear plant uncertainties.  The methods have produced good results for small problems.  In this work we will (i) extend these adaptive control techniques to treat more complex, MIMO systems; (ii) compare their performance with H-infinity control designs for a test article resident at the Picatinny Arsenal.",

To meet this urgent need, Tecolote Research, Inc. proposes to develop the Navy Environmental Compliance (NEC) Model.  In Phase I we will          1)  search for, and develop a database of existing cost         studies, estimating tools, and environmental compliance         projects to determine the scope of Phase II data collection         efforts,         2)  correlate Navy procurement requirements with the search         results, and         3)  develop a preliminary environmental compliance         assessment model design for Phase II model development.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Rolling bearings for aircraft gas turbines and power drives are designed to meet endurance requirements basically determined according to the Standard fatigue life calculation method. This method is based on Lundberg-Palmgren fatigue life theory as modified by reliability, material and lubrication factors. As aircraft load and speed requirements increase, this method results in bearings of increasing size, significantly adding to the size and weight of the gas turbines and power drives. Newly developed life prediction methods recognize the existence of a fatigue limit stress. If the stresses an operating bearing experiences do not exceed the limit stress, the bearing can achieve infinite life. Bearings designed using these new methods will have smaller diameters, weigh less and cost less. This Phase I project will investigate these new methods and analytically evaluate the utility of each by comparing fatigue lives so predicted with actual fatigue life data accumulated by aircraft engine and power drive manufacturers. To conduct the evaluation, computer programs BBEAN2 and CYBEAN2 will be used for bearing performance analysis. Assuming reasonably successful comparison of actual and analytical data, a Phase II project will further develop a practicable method using the fatigue limit stress for aircraft bearing design.",

Feasibility studies will include surveys of infra-red and radio spectrums at hospital sites, andpreliminary breadboard systems to evaluate transmitter power for dropout-free signal transmission. Itis likely that infra-red telemetry will utilize patient tracking in order to achieve satisfactory signal to noiseratios.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Department of Defense is actively pursuing the development of Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV). Visual feedback provided to the operator is a major component required for the successful control of the ROV. The proposed approach utilizes dual units of a patented TRI imaging system, Omniview TM, in conjunction with a helmet tracking system to create a stereo image representation of the remote environment. A wide angle (180 degrees) image is used as the input and portions are displayed stereoscopically based on the head position of the operator. The Omniview approach uses a composite video camera and wide angle lens to capture the image and then transforms the image to perform pan, tilt, and rotation without any mechanical movement minimizing payload size and weight. As a result, this omnidirectional viewing system can be inserted into confined areas such as existing ROV's and provide visual feedback not possible with other approaches. Advantages of this approach in remote viewing applications include miniaturization, cost reduction, multiple image delivery from a single camera, fast response, high resolution, and greater reliability. Since no actuators are used, the approach can be miniaturized and hardened to provide an effective solution to remote viewing applications. The operator will be fitted with a helmet tracking system which will be utilized to control the pan, tilt, and rotation functions of the specialized electronics. This effort will address through design trade-off studies, the specific issues associated with the Free Flight Rotorcraft Vehicle (FFRRV) including integration of the operator helmet tracking system and the additional electronics required for the stereovision pan, tilt and rotate.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Sonar transducer mounting hardware installed on current U.S. Navy submarines is constructed from metallic materials that have been found to have costly corrosion problems. Metallic transducer mounting brackets are heavy, are constructed from expensive corrosion resistant metals, use expensive corrosion resistant surface treatments and incur high maintenance costs due to replacement in as little as two years of service. High corrosion rates in mounting hardware also reduces sonar system availability and reliability. TRI/Austin is presently developing high performance polymer composite sonar transducer brackets to replace the current metallic TR-317 and DT-276 transducer brackets. The prototype brackets are injection molded using advanced polymer resin systems highly loaded (40% to 60%) with long glass fibers and mineral fillers. Cost analyses have shown that the TR-317 composite brackets cost under $10 to manufacture at low volume mold runs (100 parts) and cost under $5 at high volume mold runs (10,000 parts). Current metallic TR-317 brackets cost the U.S. Navy $19 per part. Laboratory and field tests have shown these composite brackets to be a viable low cost, light weight, high strength and corrosion free replacement for their metallic counterparts. Recent MIL-S-901-D explosive shock testing has qualified the brackets for Fleet development. TRI/Austin will utilize the expertise and composite material technology advances gained from its current development effort to develop polymer composite replacement brackets for the metallic DT-537 and DT-538 hydrophone assembly brackets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Biological control technology is needed in commercial agriculture to control destructive agents.  In some cases, chemical pesticides are not effective and in others chemical use can be reduced to avoid associated environmental and human health risks.  TGT, Inc., a biotechnology company formed specifically to commercialize biocontrol systems, has Trichoderma-based systems in final development that are scheduled for market introduction in 1995 under contract with corporate partners.  Production technology is adequate for limited product sales, but large scale production must be refined for these products to achieve the low cost and high quality needed for wide-scale use.  The proposed research will provide the requisite production methodology for large-scale production of bioprotectants.  Extensive research has demonstrated the feasibility of a two stage fermentation system for large scale production.  A liquid fermentation (seed) stage followed by a solid matrix production stage is capable of producing high yields of quality product with shelf life and formulation handling characteristics critical for commercial success.  Phase I research is needed to resolve fermentation parameters, refine low cost nutrient sources based on agricultural wastes, and finalize product recovery, stabilization, and formulation parameters.  Phase II can then accomplish the engineering and mechanization for large scale production.",

The most unique and novel feature of this concept is a movable regenerator. This approach, along with some newly developed materials and the Low Heat Rejection diesel technology that has been developed over the past ten years, offer the potential to attain the very high specific power and the improved fuel efficiency of a regenerated diesel engine. Under this proposed program, this investigation of the technical feasibility of this regenerated engine will continue. Aspects and features of the engine that have not yet been considered will be examined, including combus- tion and emissions performance and two stroke regenerated engine capabilities. These efforts will utilize the regenerated engine computer model developed under the current program as well as other analytical methods. As with the current program, Caterpillar will participate in these efforts at no cost to the government (they are internally funding their activities). In addition, Ultramet will be a subcontractor to ReJen on this proposed program, performing regenera- tor development and testing efforts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         An understanding of the shipbuilding construction and production issues, and the ability to implement this in ship designs, is key to the successful development of affordable Naval and commercial ships. Modern shipbuilding techniques involve assembling \"blocks\" that are pre-outfitted prior to actual ship installation. This results in complex design and 3D fabrication scheduling issues requiring efficient communications between the designers and production personnel throughout the ship development. A visualization software application is required that integrates information from various commercial software packages currently used in ship design and construction, and thus facilitates the communication of shipbuilding production concepts without requiring the development of prototypes. The Phase I effort will demonstrate, through the modeling of the ship hull block construction process, the feasibility and potential for the development of a complete visualization application for the shipbuilding process. The demonstration will be accomplished using commercially available software including JSpaceTm, an object-oriented software environment. JSpace will allow the seamless integration of existing shipbuilding data and the implementation of visual navigation, querying, and simulation capabilities to communicate the complex design and shipbuilding concepts. The visualization application will be independent of ship type and be equally applicable to both commercial and naval shipbuilding.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The M109 A6 Howitzer is a tracked combat vehicle that operates at high power and in very hazardous environments. During vehicle field use and engine maintenance operations, the current M109 radiator is vulnerable to core damage causing the loss of engine coolant. Loss of engine coolant immobilizes the vehicle because the excess engine heat cannot be removed leading to engine seizure. The proposed innovation would utilize heat pipes incororated into a radiator design that would be damage resistant, redundant, reliable, and maintainable. A heat pipe radiator can contain enough redundancy that even if a significant number of the heat pipes were damaged, the radiator would continue to operate. The loss of a heat pipe does not result in the loss of th eengine coolant or immobilization of the vehicle. As a result, the heat pipe radiator will improve the damage resistance, operation, and survivability of the M109 AG. The Phase I technical objective will be to design an innovative M109 A6 heat pipe radiator that is damage resistant, reliable, and maintainable. A representative segment of the heat pipe radiator will then be fabricated and tested under simulated service conditions. At the completion of the Phase I effort, a firm foundation will have been provided for the Phase II effort which involves fabrication and testing of a prototype heat pipe radiator installed in an M109 A6 Howitzer.",

Thesemasks will be used to fabricate both isolated transistors and arrays of RADFETs of both types forevaluation and optimization of the process as well as characterization of the sensors. The process willbe incorporated into an integrated circuit fabrication sequence so that RADFETs and circuits can bemanufactured on a single silicon substrate. Smart radiation sensors, containing a sensor as well asexcitation, control and analog to digital conversion will be developed under Phase II. These chips willbe assembled into a multisite, digital output probe. Each year close to 1 million new cases of cancerare reported in the US alone; nearly 60% or 600,000 of those cases are treated with radiation.Radioimmunoassay therapy (RIT) is currently under investigation and in clinical trials as a novel techniqueof targeting tumors. The instrument will allow real time dose rate and total accumulated dosemeasurements during RIT treatment. This information, unobtainable by any current techniques, willresult in better pre-treatment planning and post-treatment evaluation as well as potential optimizationof radiation exposure during radioimmunotherapy. In addition, the small RADFET sensors can be usedfor brachytherapy stereotactic radiotherapy and on-patient monitoring.",

THE DIFFUSE REFLECTANCE FROM THE SUBSTRATE CARRIES BAND GAP ABSORPTION INFORMATION THAT IS ANALYZED BY SOFTWARE BASED ALGORITHMS TO DETERMINE TEMPERATURE.  PRELIMINARY MEASUREMENTS OF GAAS USING DRS SHOW A SMOOTH VARIATION OF THE OPTICAL WAVELENGTHS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABSORPTION THRESHOLD BETWEEN 4 DEGREES K AND 1000 DEGREES K.  THE LAWS OF PHYSICS AND THERMODYNAMICS SUGGEST THAT THE BAND GAP MEASUREMENT CAN BE MADE ABOVE THESE TEMPERATURES.  RESEARCHERS ARE DEVELOPING TECHNIQUES AND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE DRS SENSOR TECHNOLOGY TO MEASURE ABOVE 1100 DEGREES CENTIGRADE.",

A subsetof enzymes will be characterized further by gene cloning, protein purification, analysis of thermostability,determination of optimum pH and ionic conditions, and preliminary determination of substratespecificities. Their commercial importance will be assessed, and samples will be tested by industrialpharmaceutical research groups.

Some of the notations (DFDs, OODs) are informal and therefore of uncertain meaning; others (Statecharts and STDs) are semantically restricted and therefore inexpressive; and most, if not all, are hard to translate into programs.  We want to avoid their imprecision, semantic inferiority, and the \"indeterminacy of radical translation,\" forced upon us by using language X for analysis, language Y for design, and language Z for implementation.  Ada 9X is semantically rich: anything a software engineer can clearly think, he can think, and say, in Ada 9X.  Therefore, we propose Visual Ada 9X, based on \"SCOOP\" (Software Construction with Object-Oriented Pictures) for the software life cycle's lingua franca.  SCOOP, at last, permits Visual Programming with Rules, a breakthrough in software representation.  Put SCOOP and Ada 9X together and you get a pictorial, object-based or object-oriented method and process that automatically generates Ada 9X code, improves communication among analysts, designers, implementations, and their clients, and ensures that the pictures they review are the program they get.",

Power dissipation in switching transistors and conduction losses in parasitic elements continue to limit conversion efficiencies.  Although presently available DC power supplies are substantially superior to their predecessors, a new approach is required to satisfy ever more demanding system requirements.  Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) is an emerging technology in which conventional semiconductor processing techniques are utilized to fabricate mechanical components on the scale of microelectronics.  MEMS offers the opportunity for a novel approach to high-efficiency DC to DC converters.  Using this new technology, one ought to be able to realize converters of very high efficiency, extremely small size and weight, and low cost in volume production.  A MEMS-based power converter will also enable a level of integration and automated manufacturing not possible with present generation power supply technologies.",

This project creates the opportunity for such interoperability in the near future by providing access to the ORBCOMM system through a new 6U VMEbus card in the open architecture FLTSAT terminal. The new card provides the interface to a modified industrial-grade ORBCOMM transceiver. The low-cost remote transceiver performs all the necessary operations to support two-way data communications via the VHF ORBCOMM satellites. The innovative modifications provide much higher RF and environmental performance than available with the commercial versions of the ORBCOMM Data Communicator terminal, as necessary to operate reliably,in the dense RF etnitter environment of Navy ships. The 8\"x8\"x4\" transceiver can be collocated topside with the antenna. Existing shipboard antenna designs are suitable. The time varying path diversity provided by the multiple LEO satellites provides much more flexibility in placing the antenna than is common for shipboard antennas. Upon completion of a successful Phase II demonstration, the NICL capability could be deployed almost immediately.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In an effort to more cost-effectively utilize existing assets to perform more functions, there has been a growing interest in using conventional mechanical scanned monopulse radars (normally used only for tracking single targets) to simultaneously track multiple targets.  In order to maintain acceptable track accuracy, the radar's monopulse traverse-elevation response must be carefully calibrated.  The ALTAIR radar at Kwajalein Missile Range does not presently correct for off-boresight errors.  Since the typical 15-minute pre-mission checkout is not adequate for full calibration, there is a need for a model that can be updated using limited pre-mission checkout data.  A program is described for identifying, analyzing, and evaluationg candidate monopulse models and associated calibration procedures to permit accurate off-axis tracking of depolarizing targets.  The proposed program addresses our approach for (1) making the necessary calibration measurements during pre-mission checkout, (2) updating candidate parameterized polarization  models using the calibration measurements, and (3) extracting the depolarization corrections from the model using a simple algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Phase I program would examine the feasibility of developing aircraft seat cushions that can help crews of the AH-1W to survive crashes. The effort will focus on adapting novel hydraulic air cushioning structures (HACS) to absorb the impact energy of a crash. These HACS structures, which are elastomeric compounds with controlled air-flow passages, when incorporated within the seat or cushion, could absorb tremendous amounts of impact energy during a crash. Combined with current stroking seat technology, the cushions could significantly reduce the average rate of 14.5 G and the maximum G currently experienced in helicopter seat drop tests conducted by Simula. With these shock absorbing qualities, the cushions have the potential to render certain kinds of crashes more survivable. The cushions would not be highly expensive and could be easily designed to be retrofitted to existing aircraft. In addition, later Phase II studies could investigate the incorporation of fire retardant materials to aid in the survival of post-crash fires.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         An affordable processing and manufacturing system for production of fiber reinforced complex shape metal matrix composites (MMCs) is proposed. The composites are precision cast by pressurized infiltration casting. Thin-walled ceramic molds are used to contain and infiltrate complex-shaped preforms. A powerful, user-friendly 3D graphics software package is used to interactively create mold designs from the solid model of MMC component to be cast. The software can also analyze the casting process in transient 3D to simulate mold filling. Solid freeform fabrication technology is used to directly tool ceramic molds geneated from CAD solid models, which eliminates intervening steps and part-specific tooling. This increased flexibility allows for rapid design changes, dramatically reducing the cost and lead time involved in casting complex shape MMCs. Computer integrated manufacturing incorporating solid freeform fabrication will establish pressure infiltration casting as a new paradigm for affordable and timely manufacutring of near-net shape metal matrix composites and components. The proposed effort will demonstrate enabling technology by fabricating a fiber reinforced complex shape MMC component for advanced high speed rotorcraft applications. Anticipated Benefits: The enabling technologies to be developed under this Phase I program will provide affordatble processing and manufacturing technology for rapid production of lighweight, complex shapes MMCs for primary and secondary aircraft structural applications requiring a combination of high stiffness or high strength at low weight. This would include components subjected to vibration, cyclic loading, rotation such as shafts, struts, transmission casings, compressor blades, pump housings containing gears (for reduced gear and bearing wear).",

The system makes use of efficient focal-plane scanning and modern digital baseband processing, having the potential for a wide range of target recognition, tracking, guidance, and other intelligence gathering functions. Multipath effects are suppressed through an electronically steered radiation pattern with dual nulls and novel signal processing algorithms. This approach effectively allows for rejection of the indirect signal and permits elevation tracking of the direct-path signal only. The leap-ahead technology behind these concepts is based on extensive background at UBC Inc. in two-plane, dual-polarized monopulse tracking systems. The proposed Phase I effort will focus on adapting related developments from existing UBC programs to the ground-to-ground scenario, leading to a preliminary system design. It will also include verification through analytical techniques of the ability to resolve representative targets of interest in this critical environment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         An investigation of the efficacy of low temperature aqueous phase catalytic oxidation for the destruction of organic water pollutants of significance to the U.S. Armed Forces is proposed.  It has been shown in our laboratory that organic contaminants can be mineralized in the aqueous phase using dioxygen over noble metal catalysts at temperatures between 120-160C.  Work to date has been an outgrowth of regenerative life support research for manned space exploration.  Contaminants studied have been those typical of hygiene wastepaper, humidity condensates, and urine distillates. Organics occurring in highest quantity in these streams are low molecular weight alcohols, carboxylic acids, and urea. Experimental results have indicated deep oxidation of mixed contaminant streams containing dissolved organic compounds at concentrations between 10-200 mg/L.  Studies comparing this technique with other methods of organic contaminant reduction such as photocatalysis, UV oxidation, and photoelectric oxidation have shown heterogeneous catalysis to be vastly more effective in terms of reactor size and residence time requirements.  Extension of this technique to organics commonly polluting ground and surface waters is proposed.  Contaminants studies will include trichlorethylene (TCE), 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), JP-4, and decachlorobiphenyl (a PCB).",

The RFTE has been shown to require an innovative burner concept to operate with large quantities of diluent. The high diluent concentration reduces the oxygen concentration and reduces the availability of secondary combustion air, thus requiring a departure from concentional burner design. The proposed program features design and experimental testing of candidate burners based on concepts which have been demonstrated in other, novel applications. A recommended prototype aerothemal design strategy is the expected output of this Phase I project. Testing will be performed in an existing facility at the University of Florida. Guidance and hardware support will be provided by TEXTRON-Lycoming through a subcontract, as part of their overall commitment to investigating the military and commercial possibilities of the RFTE.",

The design of a PSP system capable of making pressure measurements with 1 millisecond temporal resolution is proposed.  The Phase I research effort will identify the pertinent issues with regards to illumination and detection methods, auxiliary hardware and PSP chemistries.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The quality and durability of coatings produced by virtually all thermal spray techniques could be improved by, among other things, increasing the velocity with which coatings particles impact the coated surface and by better control of the chemical and thermal environment seen by the particles during flight. A new and innovative approach to thermal spraying is proposed that can increase coating particle velocities at least a factor of two to the 2000-2500 m/sec range. These higher coating particle velocities and improved control of the particle chemical and thermal environment during flight are expected to lead to dramatic improvements in coating quality. The process deliberately uses a repetitively pulsed, high temperature plasma jet. Such jets can be used in a variety of ways to melt and accelerate coating materials. In Phase I we propose to develop a computational model and an engineering design of a prototype pulsed plasma jet spray device. Successful development of this sprayer is expected to open up new markets for thermal spray applications and to improve the performance and durability of hypervelocity gun launch components and high temperature rocket components, and industrial applications where traditional spray is limited. Superior quality thermal sprayed ceramic and refractory metal coatings that are denser, harder, more uniform, lower porosity, and higher adhesion and cohesion. Potential commercial applications include advanced coatings for gas turbines, internal combustion engines, rocket components, load-bearing surfaces for heavy equipment, and ceramic substrates for electronics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A novel signal processing technique is proposed for the detection of buried objects using special configuration of a low frequency synthetic aperture radar. The radar data collection multiple apertures in the vertical or cross-track dimension. The angle-of-arrival signal processing, applied following the image formation, is based on the wide band Estimation of Signal Parameters Using Rotational Invarient Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm. Under the Phase I proposal, a existing simulation package will be modified to evaluate the buried target detection problem for a variety of radar parameters and target environments. Additionally, under Phase I an existing set of data collected by the ERFM rail SAR in accordance with the angle-of-arrival SAR specifications will be analyzed. These data will include a variety of buried targets such as pipes, drums, wire mesh, comer reflectors. The radar will sweep a band from 100 MUz to 1100 MHZ providing imagery with with 1 foot range and cross-range resolution. The objectives of Phase I are proof of concept with real data and sensitivity analysis to ascertain the optimal radar configurations and the limitations of the technique. Under Phase 11 a more extensive rail SAR testing is anticipated with a proof of concept airborne test using the FOPEN SAR currently being developed for Wright Laboratories. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - The novel signal processing technique proposed in this submission will provide a needed capability to for target detection of buried mines as well as other threats. It also has potential benefits in mapping to correct for tree canopy heights and in remote sensing to measure the thickness of multi-year sea ice.",

The testbed will operate on a Silicon Graphics workstation with a stereo display and Geographical Information System (GIS) software.  The Phase I activity will focus on evaluating algorithms for automated: i) Identification  and localization of hydrology drainage networks; ii) Identification of forest canopies; iii) Identification of water bodies and separation from shadow regions; iv) Identification of urban regions and detection of roads, building, bridges and airports.  The approach for Phase I will be to first conduct a survey of the existing information extraction algorithms that have been developed for SAR. Using this information and the existing capabilities at Vexcel, we will develop a suite of techniques, the most promising of which will be coded and tested using existing ERIM and JPL IFSAR data. The results will be validated with manually extracted features from optical data.  In Phase II an operational system would be developed incorporating a rule based expert system and a commercial GIS.  The final system would be designed to produce map quality products form IFSAR data.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The use of MCTs in a high-frequency, high-power motor controller requires soft switching. While MCTs are known to possess significant forward drop advantages over IGBTs or MOSFETs, their switching behavior is much more complex. Conventional PWM switching of MCTs at high frequency leads to significant switching losses due mostly to a current tailing problem during device turn-off. Zero-voltage switching or zero-current switching can be achieved with a resonant link inverter. This can greatly reduce the switching losses. However, this approach leads to higher voltage and/or current stresses on the devices.  A novel fixed-frequency, soft-switching, PWM, bidirectional, inverter/rectifier circuit employing state vector modulation is proposed for use as an MCT, four quadrant, AC induction motor controller for an electric vehicle. This new circuit topology combines the low stress advantages of the PWM circuit. Digitally controlled state vector modulation provides for low torque ripple over a wide range of motor speeds with fixed-frequency PWM control. ANTICIPATE BENEFITS: Significant potential exists with electric vehicle for the government. In the defense sector EVs can be used military utility vehicles. In the civilian sector EVs are ideally suited for post office vehicles. Virginia Power Technologies is particularly interested in using this SBIR funding to generate a product for commercial use. We feel that the commerical uses could be unlimited if an MCT based motor controller shows cost and performance advangates over an IGBT-based motor controller.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Malaria is a major parasitic disease in humans. Induction of immunity to the sexual stages, found in the mosquito host, is an important element in controlling the parasite. We have devised a conjugate vaccine by coupling protein or hapten-protein to very high molecular weight dextran. This highly multivalent construct induces rapid, persistent, high titer antibodies in the absence of adjuvant, even in neonatal and immune- compromised animals. We propose to use this vaccine construct to induce transmission blocking antibodies to a key B cell epitope of the sexual stage specific protein pfs25. While pfs25 can induce blocking antibodies, multiple immunizations with adjuvant are required. Furthermore, it has considerable homology to human epidermal growth factor. In Phase I, we will evaluate the peptide conjugate vaccine for (1) optimal peptide orientation and valency, (2) suitable carrier proteins, (3) route of immunization and (4) ability of antibodies to bind recombinant protein. This technology can be applied to other peptide-based conjugate vaccines and may be particularly valuable in conjunction with sporozoite and merozoite peptide vaccines now in development.",

We will develop immunodots and ELISA assaysfor diagnosis of Lyme disease based on cloned B. burgdorferi gene products that are humanimmunogens. We shall investigate sensitivity and specificity of these diagnostic assays. The B.burgdorferi gene-products to be used are distinct from all characterized antigens as OspA/OspB, OspC,flagellin and heat-shock proteins. In preliminary studies, we have identified a single clone from alambdagt11 B.burgdorferi library expressed in E. coli that reacted only with sera from patients with Lymedisease and failed to react with anti-OspA/OspB, anti-OspC or anti-flagellin antibodies or with sera fromnormal controls. We will finish sequencing the DNA from this clone, characterize its gene-productsbiochemically, and partially purify them. Recombinant B. burgdorferi antigens will be analyzed in ELISAand immunodot binding assays for their ability to discriminate between sera from patients with Lymedisease, sera from patients with other infectious diseases, and sera from normal individuals.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The use of Kinetic Energy Weapons (KEW) against theater missile threats, such as the SCUD, require fast and accurate aim point determination to maximize the kill probability. It is proposed to incorporate an innovative active three-dimensional (3-D) imager in each KEW seeker to significantly improve the kill rate. The proposed 3-D Imager uses a rugged laser diode illuminator to generate a narrow beam of RF modulated, near infrared (NIR) target illumination and a special charge-coupled device (CCD) camera which measures the phase shift of the backscatter radiation, relative to the transmitter illumination, for each pixel in the camera field. The camera will use a noncryogenic low noise, high-speed silicon CCD focal plane array (FPA), capable of being synchronously gated, for the 3-D imaging. An advantage of this 3-D imager is that the critical parameters of range, position, and velocity are read out directly with a minimum of algorithmic processing required. This can greatly improve system track performance by increasing the track loop bandwidth. A further advantage of sensing in the NIR is that any sensor window heating will have a negligible effect on imager signal-to-noise. Pre-selected aim points to ensure kill of weapon (nuclear, chemical, or biological); that is, to rupture the weapon case and not less important shrouds, etc. Commercial applications include: machine tool controls, industrial process controls, chamber and cavity inspection, IVHS vehicle control, satellite station-keeping and docking, and three-dimensional video for home use.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Commercial and military uses of RF/microwave anechoic chambers to conduct electromagnetic measurements of one type or another has increased considerably in recent years.  unfortunately anechoic chambers can be very expensive to build ($0.5M for small chambers, to many $M for large chambers), and operate = man weeks of effort are often required to configure and run a chamber for a specific test.  Consequently, the ability to accurately simulate the electromagnetic chamber would give test personnel a tool to simulate chamber conditions before costly and time consuming setup efforts are begun.  Furthermore, a synthesis capability that optimizes the test configuration (placement of absorber, absorber type, system under test, source antenna location, diagnostic sensor placement, etc.) would the requirements of a planned experiment. We propose to build on our present anechoic chamber simulation capabilities to develop a Windows/PC-based simulation, analysis and synthesis program..  Phase I deliverables will include the Final Report and a working and useful prototype Anechoic Chamber Simulation, Analysis, and Synthetic Software Program.  Our program goal is to develop a software tool that will: run under MS Windows with intuitive and informative graphical interfaces that are easy to use by test personnel; accurately model the significant EM physics of the chamber, antenna, absorber, and higher order test asset interactions; compute test fidelity figures of merit easily interpreted by test personnel; and synthesize and optimize configuration solutions that will satisfy test requirements.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Current IR systems are extremely susceptible to electromagnetic and radio frequency interference (EMI/RFI) because they possess large apertures that present ideal front-door entry paths for EM radiation.  Significant amounts of EM radiation (400 MHz - 18 GHz) can penetrate and couple to the IR sensor and supporting electronics, which leads to a substantial degradation in systems performance.  EMI protection is critical to the survivability of the IR system and the system host (e.g., aircraft, satellite).  Conductive metal mesh coatings on external surfaces of IR windows reduce the EM/RF signal but are mechanically soft and easily damaged.  Surface doped semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, have optical absorption and emission problems, while semiconducting carbide coatings, such as germanium carbide, suffer performance loss at the low end of the required temperature range.  QUEST Integrated, Inc. will investigate electrically conductive metal silicides and ceramics as erosion resistant EMI/RFI protective coatings for IR windows and radomes.  We will deposit selected materials as continuous film and as various mesh pattern coatings by RF plasma sputtering and study their shielding capability and IR optical transparency.",

This approach offers rapid,positive access to the contaminated zone by the microbes, substrates, andelectron-acceptors required by CAH cometabolic degradation in the vadose zone.Deployed in a borehole, the pulsed-jet system will greatly increase thepermeability of formations surrounding a wellpoint allowing implementation ofmethods to circulate and teat contaminated groundwater.  The pulsed-jet techniqueprovides a flexible means of ground penetration and permeability enhancement thatwill enable a variety of CAH bioremediation schemes.

        "abstract": "Abstract         This project will advance the state of the art of ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) jet machining technology.  Existing technology uses water as the working fluid that accelerates abrasive particles in high-velocity, highly coherent jets.  Despite successful demonstration and industrial utilization of the technology in cutting, cleaning, drilling, turning, milling, and surface-preparation operations, it remains poorly suited to important applications in which environmental considerations (safety, cleanliness, waste management) prohibit the use of liquid water.  For such situations, liquefied gases are emerging as attractive alternatives to water as the UHP jet working fluid.  In Phase I, the feasibility of obtaining cryogenic UHP jets of liquid nitrogen (LN2) will be demonstrated, and their cutting performance will be investigated.  An in-house cryogenic pump will be used to pressurize the LN2 up to 150 MPa (22 ksi).  This phase of the project will explore the thermodynamic conditioning of the UHP cryogen necessary to achieve jets with cutting power; optimal nozzle materials and geometries; and hardware requirements for addition of abrasive particles to the cryogenic jet.  It is anticipated that the proposed work will verify the feasibility of incorporating cryogenic liquids into UHP jet technology.  Exploratory tests will also be performed to entrain abrasives into the LN2 jet.  Based on these data, conceptual design of a prototype system will be prepared for fabrication and testing in Phase II.",

The vehicle is self-reporting with satellite communication and GPS capability and short-range, two-way communication and relocation via PC based RF modem.  The vehicle is planned as being samll enough to be easily launched and retrieved from small boats with limited personnel and quick turn-around.

This, along with other factors, has put many local governments in a difficult financial situation.  Business and larger governmental entitles have begun to use document image processing technology to more effectively reduce costs and provide quality services.  Document image processing allows a paper document to be converted to an electronic image that can be retrieved, printed or sent electronically or even retrieved at a distant location in a matter of seconds.\r \r The proposed Phase I project will survey rural county governments to gather necessary information to design a pilot document impage management system.  The study will identify the document type, retrieval and reporting needs of county governments and other factors that will be used to design a document management system.  In Phase II the system will be developed and tested prior to marketing the product in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         With the high cost of flight testing advanced munitions in an increasingly austere budget environment, significant effort is being devoted to developing ground based alternatives to augment actual flight testing. For maximum realism, the capability is required to test the munitions and their carrying aircraft as an integrated system in a simulated target/threat environment. A current effort is underway at Eglin AFB to connect the Preflight Integration of Munitions and Electronic Systems (PRIMES) facility and Guided Weapon Evaluation Facility (GWEF) via a fiber optic link, to provide such an integrated capability for certain current generation aircraft. While the current GWEF/PRIMES development activities may provide some level of current generation stores management and avionics simulation capability, next generation delivery platforms will be based on the highly integrated and modular advanced avionics concepts reflected by the Pave Pillar advanced avionics architecture and associated Joint Integrated Avionics Working Group (JIAWG) standardization activities. To ensure a continued integrated test capability as these advanced platforms evolve, the effort proposed here would define a compatible advanced avionics support capability for munitions testing and a recommended approach to its realization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This innovation proposes the use of a thin film stratospheric balloon to lift a launch vehicle with a payload to an altitude above most of the Earth's atmosphere, then ignite the launch vehicle rocket motor.  It will have the capability to carry the payload to its final destination, either into Earth orbit or to the mission design goal.  This launch system will eliminate the first stage rocket thrust normally required to overcome the atmospheric requirements.  A Balloon Assisted Launch System will improve launch vehicle efficiency, save energy, reduce costs, and provide users with greater flexibility in selection of launch sites, including terrestrial and ocean surface locations.  The cost effectiveness of sea launched Balloon Assisted Launch Systems versus conventional ground based systems that require standard range operations will be determined.  This proposed launch system can make orbital capability available to organizations such as universities, research centers, commercial organizations, and countries that cannot effort to develop the conventional complex and expensive launch facilities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Nitric oxide (NO) is a free-radical gas that is implicated in many important physiological roles,including such fundamental processes as blood pressure regulation and memory formation. While muchindirect research has been performed on systems that use NO, studies of direct in vivo application ofNO have been hindered by the volatility of NO and the potential toxicity of currently-used methods ofdelivering it. A new method for delivering NO is proposed, based on the availability of new, \"caged\"compounds. These substances conserve their biological activity until activated with light stimuli of theappropriate wavelength. A sequential, three stage experimental approach will be employed to prove thefeasibility of the method, culminating in the demonstration of feasibility in an experimental animal model.In addition to enabling NO delivery in an animal with intact neuronal and vascular circuits, the methodwill apply to other neurotransmitters. Based on the design flexibility, a wide range of potentialapplications are envisioned: in micropharmacology experiments (where the delivery method promisesbetter temporal resolution and receptor coverage than currently available micropharmacologicaltechniques, including microiontophoresis and pressure ejection); in new in vivo and in vitro macropharma-cological approaches; and in new photodynamic cancer therapies.",

The language-independent architecture is supported by XML, the Xinotech Meta-Language, and XPAL, the Xinotech Pattern Abstraction Meta-Language, which is an XML component.  Xinotech proposes to use its metalanguage infrastructure, more specifically XPAL transformations, to instantiate its visual environment for the fully automatic and semi-automatic translation from various FORTRAN dialects to Ada 9X.  THis translation environment will also support parallel FORTRAN dialects and parallelization of resulting Ada 9X sources to meet specific architectures.  Xinotech's existing Ada 9X Philosophy Transformation Library will be embedded into the translator to enhance its abstraction capabilities into the higher level Ada 9X models.  The existing Xinotech Object Prospector will be instantiated to support the selection of FORTRAN candidate objects for object-orientation under Ada 9X.",

The front-end tools will include the Xinotech Composer for syntax-directed construction, integrated with the Graph Abstractor, and the rules-based Guideliner. The back-end will make use of a static scheduler, a translator and a dynamic scheduler, already existing for PSDL. XPAL, the Xinotech Pattern Abstraction Language, will be used to specify transformation libraries to generate Ada from PSDL, and to partially generate PSDL from existing Ada programs imported into the environment. An XPAL library to transform and restructure PSDL specifications will be provided. This library will be very useful in automating and speeding the rapid prototyping process through iterative modifications needed to finalize the design. This environment will have a uniform, open architecture supported by GUI's such as Motif and Windows NT. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Successful development of this effort will produce a complete, practical environment for rapid prototyping of real-time embedded systems using PSDL targeted for Ada. This environment will significantly increase programmer productivity and the reliability of large software systems, as well as early detection of design flaws which are unattainable goals with the present software development methods and tools.",

This new instrument is an extension of the well-proven multifilter rotating shadowband radiometer and would substantially improve the existing measurement of solar UV-B radiation.  The instrument is of the filter spectrometer type and utilizes a micro-processor controlled rotating shadowband to block out the sun's disk when the measurement of the diffuse component is being made.  The measurement of the global solar radiation is made with the shadowband rotated to its nadir position.  The subtraction of the diffuse component from the global irradiance value results in a value for the direct component.  The major research task involves extending the measurement range from the visible to the UV-B wavelengths.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Lithium-ion rechargeable battery technology has been developed and commercialized by several Japanese organizations.  Small cylindrical cells are now available in the United States through Japanese manufacturers for laptop computer, cellular telephone and camcorder applications.  Lithium-ion cells offer several advantages such as high operating voltage (3.6 - 3.7V), long cycle life (>1000 cycles) and enhanced safety with minimized environmental impact. The high cost ($8-10 per Wh) of the state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries, however, is presently preventing their widespread commercial use.  The primary objective of this Phase I SBIR Program is to develop a low cost, high rate, high energy density prismatic design Lithium-ion cell in a plastic case.  Three areas of investigation are planned to meet the technical objectives:          * Chemistry and material research         * Component and process development         * Prismatic cell development and performance evaluation  The proposed advanced battery is expected to provide a specific energy of 120 Wh/Kg and an energy density of 260 Wh/l.  The cost of the battery will be <$5 per Wh.",

While much attentionhas been focused on the problems that occur during prosecution of patent applications, little has beenfocused on the quality of those applications. This research will assess the technical feasibility ofdeveloping a knowledge-based expert system for facilitating the authoring of recombinant DNA inventiondisclosures. The purpose of the software is to improve the quality of international and U.S. patentapplications for the purpose of reducing the duration of their pendency and associated uncertaintyregarding the scope of their claims. International and U.S. invention disclosure requirements will bereviewed to provide a basis for development of a software requirements specification.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Diameter of wool and other animal fibers is the most important physical characteristic in terms of its end use in textiles and it is also the most important economic criteria in marketing these fibers.  Visual appraisal of fiber diameter and variability of diameter is not an accurate, consistent method, but it is still used throughout the world.  Microprojection is the most accurate method of determining fiber diameter but it is slow, tedious and expensive.  Variability of diameter is extremely important to textile manufactures due to the advent of advanced high speed processing equipment.  The Sirolan Laserscan, AFIS System, and OFDA are computerized methods of fiber diameter measurement that stimulate microprojection and eliminate problems associated with microprojection.\r \r The objective of this proposal is to investigate the possiblity of adapting new electronic technology to replace technology developed in the 1920's and still currently used today.  Samples will be collected that represent all of the types of wool produced in the United States.  These samples will be measured by the microprojection method to provide average fiber diameter and variation in diameter.  These samples will be used in correlation trails comparing new technologies with the standard microprojection method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Studies of aircraft noise effects on wildlife have been hampered by an inability to measure animal noise exposure in the wild.  USAF supported development of a retrievable, portable Animal Noise Monitor (ANM) in 1989 and an enhanced second generation version during 1994-1995.  The weakest component of the current design is the electret microphone.  The proposed object of this research is to investigate use of a thin film transducer mounted inside the ANM case.  The thin film is a passive element that does snot consume electric power and eliminates many environmental constraints of microphones.  Preliminary experiments testing film performance bonded inside the ANM case show great potential. Limitations lie in the dynamic performance of the case, which has too many resonances in the frequency range of interest.  In finite element analysis, structural mechanics offers a simple means of studying effects of varying structural properties, such as thickness and shape, on structural resonances.  Phase I goals are (1) to isolate the film-bonding case surface area so that case size and vibration and ANM attachment mode do not affect the transduces response and (2) to modify the film attachment area so that its dynamic response meets acoustic measurement frequency requirements.  At least two case designs will be manufactured and tested to demonstrate proof-of-concept.",

The proposed concept will make possible a balance design that is inherently more rigid, since it operates at a considerably lower stress level than existing strain-gage transducers. As a result, the following advantages will be obtained: - SMALL DEFORMATIONS - REDUCED CROSS-TALK - HIGH SPEED OF RESPONSE - HIGH NATURAL FREQUENCY The bulk-birefringence readout is contactless, required no sensor cementing or wire soldering attachments. Instead, fiber-optic cables will be used to transmit the signal to the readout system for remote measurement of individual force components. As part of the propsed effort, a prototype will be designed and produced. An experimental evaluation will be carried out to quantify the merits of the proposed innovation and to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed concept.",

The specific objectives include design and partial prototyping of : 1) head stabilization device to keep head movements below 2mm; 2) experimental presentation and response system for oper- ation within the magnet; 3) cognitive experimental software for implementing common paradigms; 4) specification of standardized fMI scanning protocol; 5) workstation- to-MR machine communication  software; 6) FMRI analysis tools including filtering, movement correction, basic image processing, angiography filtering, statistical eval- uation, particle analysis, and data filtering; 7) data visualization of 2D and 3D functional images; 8) design of a data base tracking system for FMRI data; and 9) design of help system for fMI. The widespread accessibility of these techniques should substantially speed the understanding of cortical function which will in turn provide a basis for reverse engineering of cortical computation, improve medical treatment, and potentially facilitate human factors assessment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Parallax Research Inc. proposes to develop practical collimating optics for soft x-ray lasers and elemental analyses applications. Although there is no new physics involved in the operation of these optics, the ability to fabricate them economically is a recent innovation. These optics are intended to accept broad energy bandwidths of low energy x-rays diverging from a small source and re-direct them into a well collimated beam or to focus them to a small spot. Used with laboratory x-ray lasers they would collimate the poorly collimated radiation emerging from the linear x-ray laser plasma sources. When used for x-ray elemental analyses applications for the determination of elements with Z less than A1, they would revolutionize the use of wavelength dispersive spectroscopy in Scanning and Transmission (SEM and TEM) Electron Microscopy by increasing the sensitivity of detection of these elements and decreasing data collection times. If these optics were used in conjunction with energy dispersive spectroscopy, they would enable the use of smaller detectors resulting in better energy resolution and better SNR. In this phase I program, we propose to produce the prototype of a collimator which we will sell to OEM and aftermarket suppliers of elemental analyses equipment for SEM and TAM systems. Our optics will have applications in x-ray laser research, imaging fusion plasmas, x-ray microscopy, and crystallography. We have a real market to make optics for SEM/TEM systems in which we expect to be able to sell over 100 optics/yr.",

Phase II will build and test gas generators with working pressures form 25 psia to 500 psia.  The resulting system is applicable to SSTO or Space Shuttle liquid oxygen tanks, as a pressure source for turbopumps, and as a pressure source for any pressure-fed propulsion systems. In addition, the work can lead to other space applications for HAN/TEAN itself such as a secondary fluid injection control fluid, a highly reliable ignition source, or a low-cost, high performance upper stage propellant.",

Microcosm has recently developed plans and prototype hardware for such a system with an order of magnitude lower cost than existing systems. However, a key problem is flight validation of the GN&C; system without risking a high value payload or launcher.  The opportunity now exists to develop a complete, low-cost, generic flight GN&C; package and validate the performance of the system on a near-term flight of the PacAstro PA-X sounding rocket.  Specifically, Phase I will demonstrate feasibility by specifying the components, demonstrating the flight computer, and verifying controllability through 6 degree-of-freedom simulation.  Phase II will deliver and fly the full GN&C; system on the first PacAstro PA-X test flight, currently scheduled for 1997.  Phase II includes the development of actuators by PacAstro.  The results of Phase II will be to transform the PA-X flight from unguided to guided and controlled, thereby decreasing range safety concerns, and to create a fully developed and validated, near-term, low-cost, generic GN&C; system for launch vehicles.",

Digital Gate Array ICs combine functions of many logic gates into a single chip to improve speed, weight, and power dissipation.  Field programmable gate arrays reduce cost to first functional chip by an order of magnitude.  Presently no FPGAs are qualified for space radiation environment.  The project applies GaAs technology to FPGAs to impact this problem and achieve higher speed of operation and increased radiation-hardness as compared to CMOS technology (GaAs IC technology provides 3X higher speed than non-rad-hard CMOS and at least 10X higher total dose radiation-hardness than rad-hard (CMOS).  Advantages of GaAs FPGA for space applications are: miniaturization of logic functions obtained without NRE costs to make a custom IC, costs for rad-hardening and reliability testing for space qualification can be amortized over many applications, high speed (clock at 100 Mhz to 1 GHz) obtained at modest power dissipation, and total-dose radiation-hardness is better than CMOS.  GaAs single event upset hardness can be achieved with standard rad-hard circuit design techniques.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Traditionally, the recording of high speed phenomena has required the use of film cameras; though providing very fast frame rates and high resolution, film is bulky, heavy, expensive, and requires considerable processing delay before the results from an event can be viewed. In recent years, advances in solid-state imager design have made high-speed video a viable alternative to film. High speed video, however, is not a fait accompli. The imagers are multi-port chips, with high bandwidth outputs at each port. The analog signal conditioning and digitization stages of the multiple high speed signals occupy a large circuit board area. Also, the digital clocking requires significant amounts of board space. We have confronted these issues in our prototype 640 x 480, 500 frame per second high speed camera. Such cameras are needed in government and industrial applicatons that call for a rugges, small package. Multi-chip modules provide a means to braoden the use of high speed video. During Phase I, we will research the market and cultivate a working relationship with a key customer. The MCM, with a high speed imager and associated multi-port processing and digitization, will be specified and suppliers will be chosen. An initial MCM design will be fabricated. During Phase II, the MCM will be developed and integrated into a high-speed, high-resolution (i.e., 500 @ 1000 fps) digital video camera. Anticipated Benefits: A high-speed video \"camcorder\" is ideal for acquistion of short time-scale phenomena. Armament research and surveillance are two government appplications; industrial uses will span the spectrum of high speed manufacturing",

We propose to develop an electronic design, synthesis, and management tool targeted at low-power, asynchronous circuit design. We will Deliver a functional prototype tool during Phase I. The Phase II tool will support VHDL as a hardware description for high-level language input, technology mapping, automated layout synthesis, and limited built-in test support using boundary-scan and full-scan techniques. The tool will be tightly integrated into our existing low-cost component-level integrated circuit design and synthesis tools. The tool will support industry standard CAD formats, and frameworks (e.g., CFI) where appropriate. A novel self-timed synthesis methodology will be used, permitting fully statis circuits that have been shown to operate robustly with power supply voltages less than 1V. In conjunction with the inherent power advantages of asynchronous circuits, this power supply flexibility permits a wide tradeoff of operating speed vs. power consumption, in the field. During Phase I we will develop the asynchronous circuit synthesis software. We will also implement and deliver a prototype design tool, and fabricate a test IC designed with the tool. The Phase I design and prototype prepares for Phase II implementation of the complete system. Anticipated Benefits: Low-power asynchronous circuits are ideal for battery-driven notebook computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs). This is one ofthe tastest-growting IC application areas, with direct commercial application in mobile communications and portable computers. Powerful design tools are essential to the development of these ICs. We intend to directly market tools developed under this research effort.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In order to become a feasible human-interface technology suitable for operational deployment in high-noise environments, real-time speech recognition requires robust algorithms.  Robust speech processing would function as an intuitive interface to relieve crew work load and enhance crew safety, particularly in hands-busy and high-noise environments, such as cockpits.  We are currently developing an analog complementary metal-oxide-silicon (CMOS) silicon cochlea under an AF Phase II SBIR contract (AF41624-94-C-6004) specifically for noise reduction in cockpit speech-recognition applications.  During Phase I, we propose to merge traditional techniques with biologically inspired neural techniques.  The traditional technique uses a mel-cepstral coefficient (MCC) technique, with a vector quantizer (VQ) and a phoneme-based hidden Markov model (HMM).  The biologically inspired technique uses a noise-insensitive cochlear model, with a trainable, time-invariant learning vector quantizer (LVQ).  In the third algorithm, the traditional MCC front end passes its output to the LVQ classifier; for the fourth algorithm the cochlear model use the VQ codebook.  All four algorithms send their outputs to word-based HMMs.  In this way, we exploit the strengths of the front ends, as well as the strengths of the classifiers.  Word-based predictions from all four classifiers are fed to a neural classifier that selects the appropriate word spoken.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Printed-Circuit antennas offer the potential for high gain, efficient, compact, light-weight, conformal antenna array systems. We propose to develop a Design Automation system consisting of design, simulation and synthesis tools targeted at Printed-Circuit array antenna development.  We will seamlessly integrate the system into our existing, low-cost layout editor L-Edit and an electromagnetic simulation tool currently in development, and we will support industry standard geometry fields for capturing existing designs.  We will enhance graphics and tabular display modules to display input impedance, radiation patterns, gain and efficiency.  To facilitate design entry, we will develop library elements for commonly-used antenna and feed elements, in a multi-layered environment.  Where appropriate, we will offer parameterized elements to support tuning, sensitivity analysis, synthesis and self-adaptation algorithms.  The user-interface will be layered, with options, and technology- specific parameters set to reasonable, default values for use by the novice designer, but configurable for customization by the expert designer.  We will deliver a functional prototype system at the end of Phase I.  During Phase II, we will enhance the system with an antenna/array synthesis capability, technology mapping, and an enhanced electromagnetic simulation capability based on additional application-specific Green's functions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Modern aircraft contain more and more lightweight, but easily damaged, composite structures, with no way to detect in-flight composite delimination or impact damage. Innovative Dynamics (IDI) proposes to address this problem by developing a distributed damage detection system based on embedded piezoelectric actuators/sensors. Prior IDI research showed that an embedded piezoceramic actuator/sensor array can detect and locate delaminations, and that the embedded array had little effect on tensile strength. Other IDI research with metal aircraft has shown that surface-mounted arrays can detect damage to aluminum panels. We propose to adapt this simple, inexpensive \"engines off\" ground inspection technology for in-flight detection. First we will build up composite panels from V-22 materials and manufacturing specs and embed sensors inside (and on) selected panels. Panels will be destructively tested to assess how the embedded sensors affect tensile and bending strength, and the remaining ones will undergo shaker and ground run-up tests to simulate flight vibrations. We will develop a damage detection algorithm by applying proven signal processing/pattern recognition algorithms to sensor signals taken before and after induced delamination.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Reverse saturable absorbers (RSAs) are optically nonlinear materials that show increasingly high absorption at higher light intensities, and are thus excellent candidate materials for making optical limiters.  However, the highest optical nonlinearities of the currently known RSAs are at least two orders of magnitude too low to be practically useful.  The focus of our Phase I project is to use Jet Vapor Deposition (JVD), a novel, versatile, and powerful vapor deposition technology, to fabricate RSA thin films with significantly enhanced optical nonlinearity, exploring various photophysical, photochemical, and nonlinear optical mechanisms, Broadband optical limiting will be realized by combining a number of RSAs with enhanced nonlinearities in difference spectral regions into a single film.  For practical applications, JVD optical limiting films may be directly applied to optical elements such as window and lenses, or optical instruments such as goggles and light sensors.  JVD is a high rate, low cost, pollution-free process ready for high volume production on a commercial scale.",
