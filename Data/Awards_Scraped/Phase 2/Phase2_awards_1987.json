THE SCOPE OF THE CONTRACT WILL LIMIT THE DETAIL THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED. A METHODOLOGY FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS WILL BE DEVELOPED. THE CAPABILITY OF THE COMPOSITES INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP THE STRUCTURE WILL BE ASSESSED. THE WEIGHT SAVINGS THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED WILL BE ESTIMATED, AS WELL AS THE ASSOCIATED TECHNICAL RISKS FOR DEVELOPMENT. AS COMPOSITES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RESISTANT TO CORROSION THAN METALS, THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION OF LIFE CYCLE COSTS WILL BE STUDIED.",

EXISTING ASSAYS FOR BREAST CANCER CELLS CANNOT DE-TERMINE METHOTREXATE SENSITIVITY BECAUSE OF REQUIREMENTS FORFOR FEEDER LAYERS AND MEDIUM COMPONENTS THAT CAN RESCUE SEN-SITIVE CELLS. THIS PROPOSA WILL,THEREFORE, EVALUATE 2 DIF- FERENT APPROACHES: (1) IMPROVING AN EXISTING CLONOGENIC AS- SAY BY MANIPULATING A SERUM-FREE MEDIUM BASED ON MCDB 170, SO THAT METHOTREXAATE TOXICITY IS ACHIEVED; AND (2) DEVELOP-ING A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ASSAY FOR METHOTREXATE RESISTANCE THAT MEASURES UPTAKE OF FLUORESCEIN-CONJUGATED DRUG USING A FLUORESCENCE-ACTIVATED CELL SORTER (FACS). THE LATTER ASSAY DOES NOT REQUIRE CLONAL GROWTH. PHASE I WILL ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY MEDIUM FORMULATION FOR THE CLONAL ASSAY AND SHOW THAT METHOTREXATE DOSE-RESPONSE CURVES ARE FEASIBLE FOR NORMAL AND TUMOR-DERIVED EPITHELIAL CELLS. ADDITIONALLY, PHASE I WILL CONTINUE THE FACS STUDIES AND EXPAND POTENTIAL SOURCES OF CLINICAL MATERIAL AND CORRELATIONS SO THAT DURING PHASE II, BOTH ASSAYS MAY BE CONTINUED AND EVALUATED FOR EFFICACY AND PRACTICALITY. THE ASSAYS DEVELOPED IN PHASE I WILL PROVIDE A MEANS TO ISOLATE METHOTREXATE-RESISTANT CELLS; THEIR MECHANISMS OF RESISTANCE WILL BE EXAMINED DURING PHASE II.

CURRENTLY AVAILABLE DETECTORS ALL SUFFER FROM PERFORMANCE LIMITATIONS, MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS AND/OR EXORBITANT COSTS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS AIMED AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LARGE AREA SINGLE CRYSTAL DETECTOR WITH EXCELLENT QUANTUM EFFICIENCY, NO IMAGE DISTORTION AND HIGH MAXIMUM DATA RATES. THE TECHNOLOGY TO BE USED IS BASED ON THE LARGE AREA SILICON AVALANCHE PHOTO DIODE DEVELOPED AT RADIATION MONITORING DEVICES INC. FOR NUCLEAR COUNTING APPLICATIONS AND SHOULD RESULT IN A RELIABLE DETECTOR WITH REASONABLE COSTS. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL BE DIRECTED AT INVESTIGATING THE FEASIBILITY OF SPATIALLY RESOLVED CHARGE COLLECTION FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE DEVICE AND AT OPTIMIZING THE QUANTUM EFFICIENCY IN THE X-RAY REGION. DURING PHASE II WE HOPE TO USE THESE TECHNIQUES TO DEVELOP A LARGE AREA ARRAY DETECTOR FOR EVENTUAL PRODUCTION AND SALE TO THE MOLECULAR BIOLOGY RESEARCH COMMUNITY.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITERIA FOR SUCCESSFUL RADIATION THERAPY IS THE ABILITY TO DELIVER THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE TUMOR DOSE AND MINIMIZE THE DOSE TO NORMAL TISSUE. MOST TECHNIQUES CURRENTLY USED FOR SHAPING RADIATION THERAPY BEAMS INVOLVE THE FABRICATION OF CUSTOM MADE, DENSE ALLOY BLOCKS. WHILE THESE BLOCKS HAVE PROVEN TO BE RELATIVELY EFFECTIVE, THEIR CONSTRUCTION IS VERY LABOR INTENSIVE AND EXPENSIVE. THEY ARE ALSO POORLY SUITED FOR DYNAMIC RADIATION THERAPY OR WHEN MORE THAN A FEW TREATMENT PORTALS ARE DESIRED. DUE TO RECENT ADVANCES IN COMPUTERIZED CONTROL SYSTEMS, IT SHOULD NOW BE FEASIBLE TO DEVELOP A COMPUTER CONTROLLED, MULTILEAF COLLIMATOR FOR USE IN BOTH STATIC AND DYNAMIC RADIATION THERAPY. SUCH A DEVICE COULD BE MADE TO FIT INTO THE BRACKETS CURRENTLY USED TO HOLD THE ALLOY BLOCKS AND THUS BE COMPATIBLE WITH EXISTING MACHINES AND PROTOCOLS. RMD, INC., IN COLLABORATION WITH THE MASSACHUSSETS GENERAL HOSPITAL, PROPOSES TO DO THE RESEARCH NECESSARY TO DEVELOP THIS NEW DEVICE. SUCH A SYSTEM SHOULD PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENT IN THE QUALITY OF RADIATION THERAPY BY PROVIDING MORE EFFECTIVE SHAPING OF RADIATION THERAPY PORTALS AND BY MAKING POSSIBLE THE SHAPING OF THE PORTALS DURING ARC THERAPY.",

DUE TO THE VAST AMOUT OF SURVEILLANCE DATA THAT NEEDS TO BE PROCESSED, E-C2 OPERATORS FACE A DIFFICULT TASK IN CARRYING OUT THEIR MISSIONS. COMPLEX NUMERICAL ALGORITHMS FOR PROCESSING TARGET TRACKS ALREADY EXIST. HOWEVER, THE SUBSEQUENT PROBLEM OF EVALUATING THE THREAT WILL REQUIRE ALGORITHMS WHICH USE BOTH NUMERICAL AND SYMBOLIC PROCESSING. ALPHATECH PROPOSES TO FIRST DECOMPOSE THE THREAT EVALUATION PROBLEM INTO INDEPENDENT STEPS AND IDENTIFY INPUTS, OUTPUTS AND FUNCTION OF EACH STEP. ALPHATECH WILL THEN DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A COMBINED NUMERICAL AND SYMBOLIC ALGORITHM IN DETAIL FOR ONE STEP AND DEMONSTRATE A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM FOR THREAT EVAUATION. NUMERICAL PROCESSING WILL BE BASED ON THE MATHEMATICS OF ESTIMATION, STATISTICAL DECISION AND OPTIMIZATION THEORY. SYMBOLIC PROCESSING WILL BE BASED ON KNOWLEDGE ACQUIRED FROM E-2C OPERATORS AND IMPLEMENTED AS A SIMPLE EXPERT SYSTEM. THE NUMERICAL AND SYMBOLIC PROCESSING WILL BE COMBINED BY MEANS OF A COMMON DATA BASE. BASED ON THIS ALGORITHMS, A PROTOTYPE COMPUTER PROGRAM WILL BE DEVELOPED TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF CONSTRUCTING AN OPERATIONAL DECISION AID FOR E-2C OPERATORS.",

SUCH MECHANICAL SYSTEMS ARE OR RELATIVELY LARGE SIZE AND MASS. THERE IS A NEED FOR A SOLID STATE SCANNING DEVICE WHICH WOULD OFFER BENEFITS OF REDUCED SIZE AND MASS, NO MOVING PARTS, IMPROVED RELIABILITY, LOW COSTS, AND LOW POWERREQUIREMENT. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED OPTICS (IO) STRUCTURE FOR SCANNING A LASER BEAM. THE IO DEVICE UTILIZES THE ELECTRO-OPTIC EFFECT OF A THIN FILM MATERIAL TOESTABLISH A BRAGG DIFFRACTION GRATING IN A PLANAR WAVEGUIDE. THE BRAGG GRATING CAN BE ACTIVATED OVER SMALL LOCALIZED REGIONS, AND BY VARYING THE LOCATION OF THE ACTIVATED REGION, THE SPATIAL LOCATION OF THE DIFFRACTED BEAM CAN BE VARIED. A LENS CHANGES THE SPATIAL VARIATION INBEAM POSITION TO AN ANGULAR VARIATION IN BEAM POSITION. THEOBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I EFFORT IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE DIFFRACTION EFFICIENCY OF AN ELECTRO-OPTIC INDUCED DIFFRACTION GRATING IN A PLANAR WAVEGUIDE AS A FUNCTION OF WAVEGUIDE THICKNESS, APPLIED VOLTAGE, AND LENGTH AND ORIENTATION OF THE GRATING. THIS DATA WILL BE ANALYSED TO SPECIFY THE RESOLUTION AND ANGULAR SCAN RANGE OF THE PROPOSED SOLID STATE LASER SCANNER.",

HOLOGRAPHIC LENSES ARE VERY LIGHT AND CAN BE MANUFACTURED AT VERY LOW COSTS. APPLICATIONS OF HOLOGRAPHIC LENSES TO HUD WERE LIMITED IN THE PAST, DUE TO WIDE SPECTRAL BAND OF THE HUD - CATHODE RAY TUBE (CRT). HOWEVER, WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NARROWER SPECTRAL BAND CRTS, THE UTILIZATION OF HOLOGRAPHIC COMPONENTS HAVE BECOME VERY ATTRACTIVE. HOLOGRAPHIC COMBINERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SHOWN AS VIABLE REPLACEMENT OF CONVENTIONAL COMBINERS TO INCREASE INSTANTANEOUS FIELD OF VIEW OF THE HUD. IN THE PROPOSED EFFORT WE PLAN TO DESIGN AND FABRICATE TRANSMISSION HOLOGRAMS TO REPLACE THE EXISTING RELAY OPTICS. WE PLAN TO MODEL HOLOGRAMS AS THIN COMPONENTS WITH EXTREMELY LARGE REFRACTIVE INDICES, AND FABRICATE THE HOLOGRAMS BY INTERFERONMETRIC RECORDING IN DICHROMATE GELATIN FOR LARGE SPACE BANDWIDTH PRODUCT AND HIGH DIFFRACTION EFFICIENCY. WE WILL DESIGN HOLOGRAMS USING COMPUTER LENS DESIGN SOFTWARE PACKAGE. SUBSEQUENT TO THE FABRICATION OF THE COMPONENTS, WE WILL TEST AND ANALYZE THEIR PERFORMANCE.",

THIS EFFORT PROPOSES TO DEVELOP AND TEST A BIAXIAL INTERFACE STRESS TRANSDUCER (BIST) CAPABLE OF MEASURING INTER-FACE NORMAL AND SHEAR STRESSES AT VERY HIGH PRESSURES. THE PROPOSED GAGE WOULD BE A MODIFICATION OF THE TRIAXIAL INTERFACE STRESS GAGE (TIST) THAT IS CURRENTLY USED FOR LOW OVERPRESSURE ENVIRONMENTS. AS PART OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT, TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN FROM APPLICATION OF THE TIST WILL BE INVESTIGATED. THESE ISSUES INCLUDE: (1) CROSS-AXIS ACCELERATION, (2) SUSCEPTIBILITY TO MOISTURE PENETRATION, (3) GAGE CALIBRATION, (4) GAGE OFFSETS, (5) DOWNSIZING THE GAGE, AND (6) DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION.

ONE DEVICE, CALLED A FLUID-FILLED BENDER BEAM, USES PIEZOCERAMICELEMENTS TO PRODUCE A SIGNAL PROPORTIONAL TO ANGULAR ACCELERATION. THE SECOND DEVICE IS BASED ON THE MAGNETOHYDRODRODYNAMIC (MHD) PHENOMENA AND IS CALLED A MGD ANGULAR RATE SENSOR. BOTH DEVICES UTILIZE COMMON MATERIALS AND STANDARD FABRICATION PROCESSES.

CLINICAL USE OF ABR, HOWEVER, IS STILL LIMITED BECAUSE OF THE PROFESSIONAL LABOR-INTENSIVE OPERATION OF EXISTING DEVICES. THE NEED FOR EXTENSIVE PROFESSIONAL INTERVENTION DURING AND AFTER TESTING HAS LED TO LIMITED USE AND CONSEQUENTLY LOW PRODUCTION AND HIGH UNITCOST OF ABR DEVICES. ONE METHOD OF OVERCOMING THE PRACTICALDRAWBACKS OF ABR HEARING TESTING IS TO DEVELOP AUTOMATED DEVICES THAT REQUIRE MINIMAL HUMAN INTERVENTION DURING A SHORT TESTING PERIOD.

SUCH METHODS WOULD OPERATE IN REAL TIME TO ACHIEVE A DESIRED MEASUREMENT GOAL AND OBVIATE THE NEED FOR HUMAN INTERVENTION FOR (1) DISCARDING RESPONSES OF UNDESIRED ORIGIN, (2) RECOGNIZING THE RELEVANT WAVEFORMS, AND (3) ANALYZING THE OVERALL RESULTS TO PROVIDE EFFICIENT AND ACCURATE HEARING THRESHOLDS. THEREFORE, DURING PHASE I, ABR RESPONSES WILL BE COLLECTED FROM BOTH INFANTS AND ADULTS AND USED TO EVAL- UATE EFFICIENT AND SENSITIVE TECHNIQUES FOR SIGNAL ANALYSIS AND THRESHOLD DETECTION. THESE TECHNIQUES WILL THEN BE USEDFOR THE DESIGN OF A COST-EFFICIENT AUTOMATED MICROCOMPUTER- BASED DEVICE.",

IN THE HOSPITAL MODEL, THE FLUID WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY TRANSFERRED TO AN OPTICAL ANALYZER CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED. THIS HOSPITAL MODEL WILL ALLOW CONSTANT MONITOR-ING OF BLOOD GLUCOSE WITHOUT ANY DELAY BETWEEN DRAWING THE SAMPLE AND OBTAINING THE RESULTS. IN THE AMBULATORY MODEL, THE FLUID WILL BE COLLECTED IN A DEVICE THAT MAINTAINS THE SEPARATION OF SAMPLES COLLECTED AT DIFFERENT TIMES. THE SAMPLE COLLECTOR CAN BE COUPLED TO THE OPTICAL ANALYZER FOR DETERMINATION OF GLUCOSE VALUES OVER THE 2- TO 5-HOUR PERIODDURING WHICH THE SAMPLE COLLECTOR WAS USED. PAINFUL FINGER PRICKS ARE ELIMINATED. CURRENT GLUCOSE VALUES CAN BE OBTAINED AS OFTEN AS IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN GOOD CONTROL, AND A HISTORY OF GLUCOSE LEVELS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS CAN BE DETERMINED. THE AIMS OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO BUILD AND TEST THESE GLUCOSE SENSING DEVICES IN VITRO AND IN DIABETIC DOGS.",

THE SPEED OF OPTICAL-INTEGRATED VLSI DEVICES IS EXPECTED TO BE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN EQUIVALENT VLSI WITH METALLIC INTERCONNECTS, DUE TO ABSENCE OF THE RC DELAY INHERENT IN THE METALLIC CONDUCTOR SYSTEM. A KEY OPPORTUNITY, AT THIS TIME, THEREFORE, IS TO INTEGRATE GAAS LED'S ONTO SILICON VLSI CIRCUITS AND TO USE GAAS LED'S TO COMMUNICATE EITHER BY DIRECT OPTICAL INTERACTION WITH A SILICON DETECTOR,OR BY LIGHT-GUIDED OR HOLOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP METHODS OF NUCLEATION AND ISLAND GROWTH OF GAAS ON SINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON WAFERS THROUGH THE USE OF A NOVEL STRUCTURE WHICH MINIMIZES THE CONTACT AREA BETWEEN THE GAAS AND THE SILICON. THIS STRUCTURE WILL BE PREPARED USING SELECTIVE LIQUID-PHASE EPITAXY THROUGH VIAS IN A SILICON DIOXIDE LAYER ON THE SILICON WAFER. AN INTERMEDIATE NUCLEATION INTERLAYER WILL BE UTILIZED TO ACCOMMODATE THE LATTICE MISMATCH BETWEEN THE SILICON SUBSTRATE AND THE GAAS OVERGROWTH. DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN THE SILICON AND GAAS WILL BE LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE OVERALL AREA, WHICH WILL LIMIT STRAIN AND DISLOCATIONS WITHIN THE GAAS FILM.

IN ADDITION TO HIGH CONVERSION EFFICIENCY AND INTRINSIC RADIATION RESISTANCE DUE TO THE THIN ACTIVE LAYERS, THIS NOVEL DESIGN HAS SEVERAL UNIQUE PERFORMANCE ENHANCING FEATURES.

RIS INVOLVES THE STEPWISE EXCITATION, IONIZATION, AND COUNTING OF ATOMS OF A PRE-SELECTED ELEMENT, GENERALLY IN A LARGE BACKGROUND OF OTHER ELEMENTS. BECAUSE NARROW-BAND LASERS ARE USED, SUFFICIENT OPTICAL POWER ENABLES ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE ATOMS OF THE SELECTED ELEMENT TO BE IONIZED, WHILE THE INTERFERENCE FROM OTHER ELEMENTS REMAINS NEGLIGIBLE. THE IONS FROM THE SELECTED ELEMENT ARE THEN EXTRACTED AND PASSEDTHROUGH A MASS SPECTROMETER, THEREBY ACHIEVING ISOTOPIC SELECTIVITY. THE CAPABILITY OF DETECTING INDIVIDUAL NOBLE GAS ATOMS, DOWN TO THE FEW ATOM LEVEL, WHETHER STABLE OR RADIOACTIVE, ENABLES PURSUIT OF NUMEROUS APPLICATIONS OF DETECTING RARE EVENTS THAT ARE NOT TRACTABLE BY RADIOACTIVE DECAY COUNTING METHODS. BASIC RESEARCH IN NUCLEAR PHYSICS AND WEAK INTERACTION PHYSICS WOULD BENEFIT FROM SUCH A SYSTEM WITH APPLICATIONS IN FISSION YIELD DETERMINATION, BB-DECAY, COSMIC RAY INTERACTIONS AND SOLAR NEUTRINO EXPERIMENTS.

THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OFTECHNOLOGIES WHICH ARE BOTH TECHNICALLY SOUND AND COST- EFFECTIVE. THE POTENTIAL REMOVAL OF ROGANIC CHEMICALS FROM UNSATURATED SOILS VIA VAPOR PHASE TRANSPORT APPEARS TO SHOW GREAT PROMISE. THIS APPROACH HAS APPLICABILITY BEYOND THE SO-CALLED \"VOLATILE ORGANICS\", SINCE, IN THE UNSATURATED SOILS AIR AND WATER ARE BOTH PRESENT, AND HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT, LOW WATER SOLUBILITY ORGANICS HAVE RELATIVELY HIGH HENRY'S CONSTANTS AND CORRESPONDINGLY HIGH MASS TRANSPORT COEFFICIENTS ACROSS THE WATER/AIR INTERFACE. INVESTIGATIONS OF THE FEASIBILITY OF STRIPPING ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS FROM UNSATURATED SOILS ARE PROPOSED. PHASE I CONSISTS OF LABORA- TORY STUDIES TO CONFIRM FEASIBILITY AND ELUCIDATE PROCESS DYNAMICS. THREE CHEMICALS AND TWO SOIL TYPES WILL BE EXAMINED. THE TOTAL MASS OF CHEMICAL STRIPPED AS A FUNCTION OF TIME BE DETERMINED. THESE DATA WILL IDENTIFY THE POINT AT WHICH VAPOR STRIPPING REACHES DIMINISHING RETURNS AND THECORRESPONDING AMOUNT OF CHEMICAL WHICH IS STILL PRESENT IN THE SOIL SYSTEM. PHASE II WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LABORATORYSTUDIES TO PROVIDE FOR THE DEFINITION OF CRITICAL PROCESS CONTROL PARAMETERS AND FIELD STUDIES AT ACTUAL SITES OF SOILCONTAMINATION.",

HIGH ACCELERATION INCREASES THE FORCES ON THE SOLID PROPELLANT GRAIN CAUSING THE GRAIN TO SLUMP OR DEFORM. IN ADDITION TO INCREASING STRUCTURAL PARAMETERS, IT IS DESIRABLE TO INCREASE THE PROPELLANT'S BURNING RATE AND SPECIFIC IMPULSE.

THIS RESEARCH PROJECT IS FOCUSED ON THE PROBLEM OF AERATION IN THE CELL CULTIVATION PROCESS OF GROWING TISSUE CULTURES. THIS PROJECT INTRODUCES A NEW TECHNOLOGY OF USING CERTAIN LIQUID PERFLUORINATED CHEMICALS (PFC) WHICH ARE IMMISCIBLE IN AQUEOUS MIXTURES, BIOLOGICALLY INERT AND HAVE AFFINITIES FOR 02 AND C02 OFTEN REACHING 5-10 TIMES THOSE OFWATER AS A TRANSFER MEDIA. THIS PROCESS WILL USE CELL LINESTHAT GROW IN SUSPENSION CULTURE MEDIA DEVOID OF SERUM. THE DISPERSION OF PFC IN THE AQUEOUS CULTURE MEDIUM WILL FACILITATE THE RECOVERY AND RECYCLING OF PURE PFC. THE PFC WILL BE CIRCULATED THROUGH A DRAFT TUBE REACTOR TO CREATE BULK MIXING. GAS EXCHANGE OCCURS DUE TO THE DISEQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE TWO PHASES. WE WILL ATTEMPT TO QUANTIFY THE OXYGEN TRANSPORT RATES REQUIRED TO SUPPORT HIGHCULTURE DENSITIES. THIS RESEARCH COULD REMOVE ONE OF THE TECHNICAL OBSTACLES INGROWING TISSUE CULTURES IN HIGH CELL DENSITIES WHILE LOWERING THE COST OF CELL CULTIVATION. CONSIDERATION WILL BE GIVEN TO USE OF THIS NEW PROCESS IN MICROGRAVITY CONDITIONS TO DETERMINE IF THE UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES OF SPACE USING THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW INTER-ATOMIC AND INTER-MOLECULAR FORCES TO ENHANCE THE PROCESS.",

THE SEMICONDUCTOR AND AND PRINTED CIRCUIT INDUSTRY ALONE REMOVED OVER 7.2 TONS OF HEAVY METALS FROM WASTEWATER IN 1983. MUCH OF THE RECOVERED METALS ARE DISCARDED AS SLUDGES, BECAUSE TECHNIQUES FOR RECOVERING AND SEPARATING THE METAL IONS ARE UNECONOMICAL. BIO-CLEAN HAS DEVELOPED METHODS FOR IMMOBILIZING ALGAE IN SILICA GELS WHICH CAN BE PACKED INTO COLUMNS AND USED MUCH LIKE ION EXCHANGE RESINS IN THE REMOVAL AND RECOVERY OF HEAVY METAL IONS FOR SOLUTIONS. LIKE ION EXCHANGE RESINS, THE IMMOBILIZED ALGAE CAN BE RECYCLED, BUT IN CONTRAST TO CHELATING ION EXCHANGE RESINS, HARD WATER COMPONENTS (CA(II)MG (II) INTERFERE MINIMALLY WITH THE BINDING OF TRANSITION METAL IONS. IN ADDITION, CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR REMOVING METALIC OXOANIONS (CRO4-2, MOO-2) FORM AQUENOUS REMOVING METALIC OXOANIONS (CRO 4-2, MO O-2) FROM AQUENOUS SOLUTIONS USING IMMOBILIZED ALGAE. FURTHERMORE, THE BINDING CAPACITY OF THE ALGAE FOR CERTAIN METAL IONS MAY EXCEED TEN PERCENT OF THE DRY WEIGHT OF THE ALGAE. IT APPEARS THAT THE COST OF THIS SYSTEM WILL BE BUT A FRACTION OF THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH ION EXCHANGE TECHNOLOGY.

HOWEVER, CURRENTLY EMPLOYED METHODS NOT ONLY ARE VERY COSTLY, BUT EXPOSE PATIENTS TO RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS. FURTHER, NO AVAILABLE METHODS PROVIDE SECOND-TO-SECOND (E.G., REAL-TIME) DYNAMIC MEASURES OF CEREBROVASCULAR FUNCTION, GREATLY RESTRICTING THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS OF THESE METHODS. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MICROCOMPUTER-CONTROLLED ELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE BRAIN MONITOR CAPABLE OF PROVIDING ACCURATE, NEARLY CONTINUOUS IMAGING OF HEMISPHERIC AND REGIONAL CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW ^ NONINVASIVELY^AT LESS COST THAN RADIOISOTOPE-BASED METHODS. PHASE I IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE TWO-DIMENSIONAL SPATIAL CALIBRATION OF THE NONTRAUMATIC RHEOENCEPHALOGRAPHIC (REG) METHOD BY COMPARING IT WITH AN ESTABLISHED RADIOLOGICAL PROCEDURE (GAMMA CAMERA WITH 133-XENON INHALATION) IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEER SUBJECTS AND PATIENTS WITH CEREBROVASCULAR DISORDERS. AT THIS STAGE, SEVERAL ACCEPTED FLOW EQUATIONS WILL BE COMPARED WITH THE GOAL OF CALCULATING ABSOLUTE FLOW VALUES USING IMPEDANCE WAVEFORM PARAMETERS. CONCURRENTLY, A MICROCOMPUTER-BASED SOFTWARE WILL BE DEVELOPED TO AUTOMATICALLY COLLECT, ANALYZE, AND FORMAT IMPEDANCE-DERIVED DATA. THIS WILL SIMPLIFY OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM SO THAT IT WILL BE USEFUL FOR CLINICAL AS WELL AS EXPERIMENTAL APPLICATIONS. PHASE II WILL INITIALLY INVOLVE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE TO GENERATE TWO-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES OF REGIONAL CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW, BASED ON PHASE I CALIBRATION. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE COMPLETE IMAGING SYSTEM WILL AGAIN BE COMPARED TO RADIOLOGICAL METHODS (PET SCANS, CT SCANS) AND TESTED IN CLINICAL POPULATIONS.

REAGENT WHICH DOES NOT INTERACT WITH PROTEIN HYDROLYZES SPONTANEOUSLY TO A NONREACTIVE MOLECULE. UNLIKE FORMOCRESOL AND GLUTARALDEHYDE, DMS DOES NOT INDUCE AUTOANTIGEN FORMATION SINCE THERE IS NO NET CHANGE IN CHARGE OF THE PROTEIN AFTER CROSS-LINKING. THIS SUGGESTS THAT DMS IS A REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR PULP THERAPY, POTENTIALLY REPLACING FORMOCRESOL OR GLUTARALDEHYDE FOR TEETH PREDESTINED TO EXFOLIATE AND AS A CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT FOR ENDODONTIC INFLAMMATION IN ADULT TEETH. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL DETERMINE THE TOXICITY OF DMS FOR CULTURED ODONTOBLASTS BY EXAMINING CELL VIABILITY AFTER INCUBATION WITH DMS AT VARYING CONCENTRATIONS AND FOR VARYING TIME PERIODS. CELL DAMAGE WILL BE QUANTITATED BY MEASURING ENZYME ACTIVITY IN THE CULTURE MEDIUM. CELL RECOVERY AFTER TREATMENT AND ABILITY OF DMS TO CROSS-LINK PROTEINS WILL BE ASSESSED BY ONE- AND TWO-DIMENSIONAL SDS-PAGE OF CELL PROTEINS, PROTEINS RELEASED INTO THE CULTURE MEDIUM, AND TOTAL PULP PROTEIN BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT. THESE DATA WILL BE USED TO ESTABLISH DOSAGES FOR CLINICAL TRIALS IN PHASE II.",

IN A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES, THERE IS GREAT NEED FOR NEW APPROACHES TO THE REMOVAL OF IRON OR THE CONTROL OF ITS REACTIVITY. BIOMEDICAL FRONTIERS HAS PRODUCED A SERIES OF HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT IRON CHELATORS BASED ON DERIVATION OF A NUMBER OF SUBSTRATES WITH DEFER- OXAMINE B. THIS CHELATOR HAS AN EXTREMELY HIGH AFFINITY FORIRON AND IS VERY SELECTIVE (I.E., HAS RELATIVELY LOW AFFINITY FOR OTHER POLYVALENT CATIONS ASIDE FROM ALUMINUM). ADDUCTS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BETWEEN DEFEROXAMINE B AND BOTH SOLUBLE POLYMERS AND SOLID MATRICES. THE PRESENT PROPOSAL RELATES TO MAXIMIZATION OF DERIVATION PROCEDURES, DEFINITIONOF APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS OF MODIFICATION, AND DETERMINATIONOF THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DERIVED MATERIALS. THE HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT IRON CHELATORS PRODUCED AS A RESULT OF THIS WORK HAVE A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL (PHASE II) APPLICATIONS.

IN A DECENTRALIZED SCHEME, INDIVIDUAL SENSORS CORRELATE SENSOR DATA WITH OBJECTS AND TRACK THEM INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE OTHER SENSORS. COMPLETE TRACKS ARE SENT BY THE SENSORS TO THE WEAPON PLATFORM FOR A HIGHER LEVEL CORRELATION OF TRACKS WITH TRACKS AND MORE REFINED TRACKING (THE TRACK FUSTION FUNCTION). THIS ALSO REDUCES COMMUNICATION RATES BECAUSE TRACKS ARE BEING COMMUNICATED RATHER THAN ALL THE DATA. THE MAJOR INNOVATION PROPOSED IS TO DEVELOP A DECENTRALIZED TRACK/CORRELATION APPROACH BASED ON A NOVEL DECENTRALIZED SQUARE ROOT INFORMATION FILTER (SRIF) RECENTLY DEVELOPED BY DR. G.J.

WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED AND CHARACTERIZED A HELIUM-COOLED RADIOMETER OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS. THIS SUCCESSFUL INSTRUMENT IS OPTIMIZED FOR LABORATORY STANDARDS APPLICATIONS AND IS PRESENTLY BEING USED FOR STUDIES OF PHOTODIODE YIELD UNDER LASER ILLUMINATION. THE AIM OF THIS PHASE I STUDY IS TO DESIGN AND CONSTRUCT AN ULTRA LOW-MASS RECEIVER FOR THIS RADIOMETER AND TEST ITS PERFORMANCE AGAINST A NUMERCIAL HEAT FLOW MODEL. THIS COMPARISON WILL ENABLE US TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DRAMATIC ADVANTAGES IN SENSITIVITY ANDTIME CONSTANT THAT A HELIUM-COOLED RADIOMETER SEEMS TO OFFERIN SUCH A MEASUREMENT CAN BE REALIZED IN PRACTICE. IF THE PHASE I RESULTS ARE FABORABLE, WE WILL REQUEST PHASE II SUPPORT TO CONSTRUCT A PROTOTYPE HELIUM-COOLED RADIOMETER OPTIMIZED FOR EARTH RADIATION MEASUREMENTS FROM THE SHUTTLE AND THE SPACE STATION.",

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY ARE (1) DETERMINE THE OPTIMUM LASER PARAMETERS - WAVELENGTH, PULSE ENERGY, PULSE- WIDTH, AND PULSE REPETITION FREQUENCY; (2) DEVELOP A SOLID STATE OR DYE LASER WITH THE APPROPRIATE OUTPUT CHARACTERISTICS; AND (3) ESTABLISH THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE TREATMENT TECHNIQUES IN ANIMAL STUDIES. THIS RESEARCH OFFERS THE POTENTIAL TO ESTABLISH OPERATING CRITERIA FOR A MINIMALLY INVASIVE SYSTEM TO REMOVE COMMON DUCT STONES.

THIS COMBINATION OF THESE NEW TECHNIQUES TO PRODUCEA NEW QUANTITATIVE ASSAY IS PARTICULARILY IMPORTANT, AS IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SHOWN THAT PATIENTS WHOSE TUMORS CONTAIN ESTROGEN RECEPTORS WILL HAVE A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF RESPONDING TO HORMONAL THERAPY AND SEEM TO HAVE A BETTER PROGNOSIS THAN PATIENTS WHOSE TUMORS DO NOT CONTAIN THIS RECEPTOR.",

OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO SUCCESSFUL CONTAINMENT OF CONTAMINANTS IS THE INTEGRITY, STABILITY, AND OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF SUBSURFACE BARRIERS. THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE PROPERTIES AND PERFORMANCE OF THESE BARRIERS IN-SITU IS WELL RECOGNIZED. CURRENT GEOPHYSICAL METHODS UTILIZED FOR SUBSURFACE INVESTIGATIONS AT HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES LACK THE ABILITY TO DEFINE AND RESOLVE THE PROPERTIES OF SUCH STRUCTURES, DUE TO THE LONG WAVELENGTHS AND LOSSES IN THE OVERBURDEN. THE OBJECT OF PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO EXPLOIT THE POTENTIAL APPLICATION OF GUIDED SEISMIC WAVES, SINCE THESE WAVES ARE EITHER \"TRAPPED\" IN THE ZONE OF INTEREST (SEAM WAVES), OR THEY CAN PROVIDE FAVORABLE TRANSMISSION TO THE SURFACE (TUBE WAVES). THE RESEARCH WILL SEEK TO EXTRAPOLATE EXISTING GUIDED WAVE THEORY AND APPLICATION DATA TO THE RANGE OF PARAMETERS OF INTEREST AT HAZARDOUS WASTES SITES. THE RESEARCH WILL ALSO TO DEFINE THE APPLICATION CONDITIONS AND ASSOCIATED PHYSICAL PROPERTIES IN A MANNER WHICH PROVIDES A CLEAR BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSTRUMENTATION BASED ON GUIDED WAVE PHENOMENA. THESE TWO ACTIVITIES WILL BE FOLLOWED BY A PILOT 1/5 SCALE FIELD DEMONSTRATION/EVALUATION OF A SPECIFIC INSTRUMENT CONCEPT.",

RECENTLY, THE RCE TASK COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION OF A CONTROL ROOM WHICH WOULD SERVE AS THE CENTER OF OPERATIONS FOR ASM-BASED REMOTE HANDLING SYTEMS. THE HUMAN-MACHINE INTERFACE PROVIDED BY THIS CONTROL ROOM WILL BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF ASM-BASED TELEOPERATORS. THEREFORE, THE ASM CONTROL ROOM REQUIRES THOROUGH TESTING AND EVALUATION TOINSURE THAT ALL NECESSARY CONTROL FUNCTIONS ARE PROVIDED, ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION IS DISPLAYED, INTER-OPERATOR COMMUNICATION IS OF SUFFICIENTLY HIGH-QUALITY, AND CONTROLS/DISPLAYS ARE PROVIDED IN A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE MANNER. THE ASM CONTROL ROOM MUST BE EVALUATED IN TERMS OF ITS PERFORMANCE IN REMOTE MAINTENANCE SCENARIOS AND ITS EFFECTS ON ITS USERS (I.E. EASE OF USE, WORKLOAD, FATIGUE). DURING PHASE I OF THE RESEARCH, A METHOD FOR EVALUATION OF THE ASM CONTROL ROOM (AND APPLICABLE TO OTHER CONTROL ROOMS FOR MANIPULATOR SYSTEMS) WOULD BE DEVELOPED. A PRELIMINARY EVALUATION OF THE ASM CONTROL ROOM WOULD BE CONDUCTED, OBVIOUSLY SUB-STANDARD COMPONENTS WOULD BE IDENTIFIED, AND ASET OF SCENARIOS IN WHICH THE ASM IS EXPECTED TO FUNTION WOULD BE DEVELOPED. THE METHOD OF EVALUATION WILL ADDRESS THREE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT PROBLEMS. FIRST, THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF ASM INTERFACES (WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF MENU-BASED TOUCH SCREENS) MAKES IT NECESSARY TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF MENU ORGANIZATION AND MENU CHANGES. SECOND, INTER-OPERATOR COMMUNICATION WILL BE AN IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE FACTOR AND MUST BE ADDRESSED. THIRD, THE RELATIVE LACK OF PREVIOUS RESEARCH INTO THE HUMAN-MACHINE INTERFACE FOR SERVOMANIPULATOR HANDLES MAKES IT NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW METHODS FOR EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ASM MASTER CONTROLLER HANDLE.",

SINCE THIS TEMPERATURE RANGE IS COMPATIBLE WITH NON-EQULIBRIUM, MHD GENERATORS, WE ALSO PROPOSE TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING A HIGH EFFICIENCY, HYBRID BRAYTON-RANKINE CYCLE AS A SPACE BASED NUCLEAR-MHD POWER SYSTEM. THE COMBUSTOR ALLOWS THE HEATING OF THE MHD GENERATOR WORKING FLUID TO CONDITIONS THAT CAN SHARPLY INCREASE THE GENERATOR PERFORMANCE FAR BEYOND THE BEST LEVELS ACHIEVED TO-DATE. IN PHASE I OF THE PROJECT, THE PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COMBUSTOR WILL BE DETERMINED FROM NUCLEAR-MHD CYCLE ANALYSES, AND MHD GENERATOR ANALYSES. THE OPTIMUM PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS WILLBE SELECTED FOR A COMCEPTUAL DESIGN OF A CHEMICAL FUEL, COMBUSTOR-MHD SYSTEM. THE OUTPUT OF THE STUDY WILL BE THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF THE NOVEL CHEMICAL FUEL FIRED COMBUSTOR-MHD SYSTEM, AT A SCALE SUITABLE FOR LOW COST EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION IN SUBSQUENTPROJECT PHASES. VALIDATION OF THE PROPOSED COMBUSTOR CONCEPT WOULD REPRESENT A MAJOR ADVANCE IN HIGH POWER GENERATION TECHNOLOGY, FOR BOTH PULSED AND CONTINUOUS APPLICATIONS. ANOTHER OUTPUT OF THE STUDY WILL DETERMINATE THE PERFORMANCE POTENTIAL OF A NOVEL HYBRID BRAYTON-RANKLINEMHD POWER CYCLE, USING THE ABOVE NUCLEAR REACTORS AS A HEAT SOURCE.",

COHERENT LIDAR SYSTEMS ARE PROVEN INSTRUMENTS FOR THE REMOTE MEASUREMENT AT ATMOSPHERIC WIND PROFILES. A RANGE RESOLVED COHERENT DIAL SYSTEM HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED AT THIS TIME. PULSED COHERENT DIAL SYSTEMS OFFER MUCH GREATER SENSITIVITY AND RANGE THAN INCOHERENT DIAL SYSTEMS ESPECIALLY IN THE INFRARED WAVELENGTH REGIONS. THE EVENTUAL GOAL IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF COMBINED WIND AND WATER VAPOR PROFILES FROM A SPACE PLATFORM. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE FEASIBILITY AND DESIGN PARAMETERS FOR A GROUNDAND A SATELLITE-BASED COHERENT DIAL AND WIND PROFILING SYSTEM. TO PREDICT THE PERFORMANCE OF A COHERENT DIAL SYSTEM, AN EXISTING COHERENT LIDAR COMPUTER SIMULATION FOR WIND MEASUREMENT WILL BE MODIFIED TO INCLUDE THE DIAL MEASUREMENT PROCESS. THIS COMPUTER SIMULATION WILL CONTAIN THE WIND MEASURING PROCESS, DIAL LIDAR CHARACTERISTICS, ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS, SPECTROSCOPIC DATA, AND DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES, AND WILL BE EXERCISED EXTENSIVELY TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND DESIGN PARAMETERS FOR A COHERENT COMBINED WIND AND DIAL SYSTEM FOR BOTH A GROUND-BASED AND OPERATIONAL SATELLITE PLATFORM.",

AN ELECTRONICALLY CONTROLLABLE REFLECTIVE SURFACE BEING DEVELOPED ON A NASA SBIR IS THE STARTING POINT FOR THE WORK. THIS PROJECT EXTENDS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SURFACE SO THAT IT IS USEFUL AS A NULL FORMER. THE RESULT IS CONSIDERABLY REDUCED COST OF NULL STEERING ANTENNAS. THE DEVICE FORMS PART OR ALL OF THE ANTENNA'S MAIN REFLECTOR OR ITS SUBREFLECTOR. THE REFLECTIVE PHASE (AND AMPLITUDE IF REQUIRED) OF EACH SMALL PORTION OF THE UNIQUE SURFACE IS CONTROLLABLE SO THAT THE TOTAL PATTERN REFLECTED OFF THE SURFACE IS CONTROLLABLE. IN THIS PROJECT, THE USE OF THIS DEVICE TO FORM ANTENNA NULLS IS EXPLORED. THE NECESSARY DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BASIC NASA SURFACE ARE DEVELOPED AND TOTAL ANTENNA PERFORMANCE USING THE DEVICE AS A NULL STEERER IS PREDICTED. PHASE 2 OF THIS PROJECT WILL VERIFY NULLING PERFORMANCE BY MEASUREMENTS.",

IN THIS PROJECT WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A TELEPHONE/COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT WILL LARGELY AUTOMATE THESE SERVICES. A DEVICE CONSISTING OF A COMPUTER, A VOICE DIGITIZER, A COMPUTER/TELEPHONE CONNECTION, AND A TOUCH-TONE DECODER WILL MAINTAIN PERIODIC TELEPHONE CONTACT WITH CLIENTS WHO SIGN UP FOR PREVENTIVE SERVICES, ASK THEM QUESTIONS (BY DIGITIZED VOICE) ABOUT THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROGRAM(S) THEY HAVE UNDERTAKEN, DECODE THEIR ANSWERS (ENTERED VIA TOUCH TONE), BRANCH APPROPRIATELY, AND KEEP RECORDS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS. THE SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE PERIODIC REPORTS TO PROVIDERS, ALERTING THEM TO THE NEEDS OF CLIENTS REQUIRING PERSONAL HUMAN INTERVENTION. BY SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF DATA INPUT FROM THE PROVIDER DIRECTLY TO THE CLIENT, THE SYSTEM WILL ENABLE PROVIDERS TO GO BEYOND A SINGLE INTERVENTION PREVENTION PROGRAM TO A LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. IT IS PROPOSED TO STUDY THIS SYSTEM IN A MEDIUM SIZED CORPORATION THAT CURRENTLY PROVIDES PREVENTION PROGRAMS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEIR EFFECTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED.

IN PHASE II, BASIC METHODOLOGY AND GENETIC ELEMENTS WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR PRODUCTION OF BIOSYNTHETIC ANTIBODY BINDING DOMAINS OF INTERCHANGEABLE SPECIFICITY, WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY BE DESIGNED TO BIND TUMOR ANTIGENS. VH AND VL GENES MADE FOR PHASE I WILL BE REFASHIONED SO THAT HYPERVARIABLE REGIONS WILL COPY THOSE OF AN ANTIPROTEIN ANTIBODY. THIS IS INTENDED TO ALTER SPECIFICITY WITHOUT THE NEED TO REMAKE CONSTANT FRAMEWORK OF THE FV. ATTEMPTS WILL BE MADE TO FUSE VH AND VL GENES INTO A SINGLE FV GENE VIA A LINKER WHICH WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH NORMAL REFOLDING AND RECOMBINATION OF COMPONENT DOMAINS. THIS SINGLE POLYPEPTIDE CHAIN BINDING SITE WOULD BE USEFUL FOR IMMUNOTARGETING OF BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE PROTEINS. FOR EXAMPLE, A SINGLE POLYPEPTIDE CHAIN COULD BE CLONED WHICH IS BIFUNCTIONAL, COMPRISING AN FV DOMAIN THAT BINDS A TUMOR ANTIGEN AND CYTOTOXIC DOMAIN THAT CONSISTS OF A RICIN A SUBUNIT.

IN THIS RESEARCH, WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF DIFFERENT ANTIFUNGAL COMPOUNDS PRODUCED BY TWO PSEUDOMONAS FLUORESCENS RHIZOBACTERIA IN THE CONTROL OF COTTON SEEDLING DISEASE CAUSED BY PYTHIUM ULTIMUM AND RHIZOCTONIA SOLANI. THE STRAINS TO BE USED IN THESE TESTS WERE DERIVED BY SITE-DIRECTED MARKER EXCHANGE TO CREATE MUTANTS PARENTAL STRAINS. THE RHIZOSPHERE COMPETENCE, COLONIZATION POTENTIAL AND DISEASE PROTECTION WILL BE TESTEDIN A MODEL SOIL SYSTEM IN WHICH THE PARENTAL STRAINS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO GIVE SIGNIFICANT BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF P.

THE PROPOSED DESIGNS OFFER INNOVATION IN TWO IMPORTANT AREAS: THE STRUCTURAL COMPONENT OF THE FLEXIBLE LEAD AND THE CHARGE INJECTION MATERIAL. THE FIRST INNOVATION IS THE USE OF TI, TI-6A1-4V-ELI, AND TA WIRE AS THE STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS OF THE FLEXIBLE LEAD. THESE MATERIALS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE A COMBINATION OF MECHANICAL STRENGTH, FATIGUE RESISTANCE, CORROSION RESISTANCE, AND ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY SUPERIOR TO 316LVM STAINLESS STEEL OR ANY OTHER ALLOYS HERETOFORE USED AS ELECTRODE LEADS. THE SECOND INNOVATION IS IN THE CHARGE INJECTION MATERIAL. TWO MATERIALS ARE PROPOSED: IR OXIDE THERMALLY DEPOSITED ONTO TI OR TI ALLOY WIRE, AND TA2O5 ANODICALLY FORMED ON TA WIRE. BOTH IR OXIDE AND TA2O5 PERMIT REVERSIBLE AND CORROSION-FREE CHARGE INJECTION AT HIGHER CHARGE DENSITIES THAN ARE AVAILABLE WITH 316LVM STAINLESS STEEL. DURING PHASE I OF THE RESEARCH PROGRAM, WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE THE SUITABILITY OF TI, TI-6A1-4V-ELI, AND TA AS FLEXIBLE LEAD MATERIALS FOR CHRONIC PERCUTANEOUS ELECTRODE APPLICATIONS.

AREAS OF KEY CONCERN ARE THE HEAT ACQUISITION AT COLD PLATES, SUCH AS CURRENTLY DESIGNED FOR SHUTTLE EXPERIMENTS, AND THE HEAT TRANSFER FROM THE MAIN THERMAL BUSTO HEAT PIPE RADIATORS. IN EACH CASE, RELATIVELY HIGH HEAT TRANSFER CONDUCTANCES CAN BE ACHIEVED BY HIGH CLAMPING FORCES THAT MUST BE ESTABLISHED AT SPACE-ERECTABLE INTERFACEJOINTS. THESE APPROACHES CAN RESULT IN RATHER COMPLEX, HEAVY, AND COSTLY DEVICES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO EXAMINE THE FEASBILITY OF EMPLOYING A FERROFLUID AT THERMALLY CONDUCTIVEINTERFACES TO ENHANCE HEAT TRANSFER. THE MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF THE FLUID WILL BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEPROPER ORIENTATION OF MAGNETIC FIELD LINES, DEVELOPED BY PERMANENT MAGNETS, TO DISTRIBUTE THE FLUID OVER THE JOINT AND AID IN RETAINING THE FLUID IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE. THE PLANNED APPROACH IS TO DEVELOP TEST APPARATUS AND EVALUATE THE ENHANCED INTERFACE CONDUCTANCE IN VACUUM RESULTING FROM THE INCLUSION OF VARIOUS CANDIDATE FERRO-FLUIDS BETWEEN TYPICAL INTERFACE MEMBERS. DESIGN CONCEPTS FOR RELIABLY STOWING, DEPLOYING, AND CONTROLLING THE FERROFLUID PRIOR TO AND DURING INTERFACE ASSEMBLY OR REPLACEMENT WILL BE DEVELOPED.

A LARGE PART OF THAT PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT IS DUE TO THE REDUCED FEATURE SIZE OF THE GATE ELECTRODE. RECORD SWITCHING TIMES (6 PS) HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED USING GATE LENGTHS OF 0.3 MICROMETERS (UM). SHORTER GATE LENGTHS POTENTIALLY WILL HAVE EVEN SHORTER SWITCHING TIMES WITH NOVEL EFFECTS SUCH AS VELOCITY OVERSHOOT EXPECTED. GAIN ELECTRONICS CORPORATION (GAIN) PROPOSES TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR PROCESSES ULTIMATELY REACHING MINIMUM DIMENSIONS OF LESS THA 0.1 UM. IN PHASE I OF THIS LONG TERM PROJECT WE INTEND TO DEVELOP TEST PATTERNS FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF SDHT DEVICE SCALING. SUBMICRON PATTERNS WILL BE EXPOSED BY A DIRECT-WRITE E-BEAM SYSTEM AND METHODS OF PATTERN TRANSFER (WET CHEMICAL ETCH, REACTIVE ION ETCH, ION MILLING) WILL BE EVALUATED FOR ACCURACY AND PRECISION IN TRANSFERING THE PATTERN FROM RESIST TO THE WAFER AND FOR CAPABILITY OF MAINTAINING HIGH ASPECT RATIOS OF THE ETCH. AT THE END OF THE PHASE I PERIOD, GAIN WILL BE READY TO APPLY RELEVANT PATTERN TRANSFER METHODS TO THE ULTRA-SUBMICRON DEVICE APPLICATIONS OF SDHT DEVICES AND CIRCUITS.",

THE RELATIVE SIMPLICITY OF THE METHOD SUGGESTS ITS EASY USE BY MEDICALLY UNSOPHISTICATED INDIVIDUALS. WE WILL ATTEMPT INITIALLY TO DETERMINE THEOPHYLLINE IN SERUM AT A LEVEL OF 5 G/ML. ULTIMATELY, OUR AIM IS TO INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE ASSAY SYSTEM INTO THE 1-50 G/ML RANGE. THIS WILL REQUIRE THE USE OF A HAND-HELD REFLECTOMETER ($1,000 PER UNIT CURRENTLY) FOR READING THE STRIPS. HOWEVER, IT IS FEASIBLE BY VARYING THE AMOUNT OF ANTIGEN AND ENZYME MODIFIED ANTITHEOPHYLLINE WITHIN THE IMMUNOSTRIP THAT WE CAN PRODUCE A VISUAL ASSAY WITHIN THIS LOWER RANGE. THE ASSAY HAS MANY APPLICATIONS FOR MONITORING THERAPEUTIC DRUGS, INCLUDING THEOPHYLLINE, AND THEREFORE WILL HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE HEALTH BENEFIT/RISK RATIO WITHIN POPULATIONS OF OUR SOCIETY WHO REQUIRE DRUGS. BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO MONITOR OTHER HORMONES, DRUGS, AND SMALL HAPTENS USING THIS ASSAY, WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT IN THE FUTURE BY USING HIGHLY SPECIFIC POLYCLONAL ANTISERA OR MORE LIKELY MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO MONITOR ACTIVE THEOPHYLLINE AND INACTIVE METABOLITES IN BLOOD AND THEREBY PREDICT THERAPEUTIC VERSUS TOXIC LEVELS OF THEOPHYLLINE IN A PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE WITH A ONE-MINUTE TEST.",

IN CONTRAST TO SOME MINICOMPUTER-BASED CHROMOSOME \"\"IDENTIFICATION'' SYSTEMS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT OR BEING ACTIVELY MARKETED, THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WOULD ALLOW THE TRAINED CYTOGENETICIST TO DO THE ACTUAL ANALYSIS ASSOCIATED WITH CHROMOMOSOME RECOGNITION AND THE RECOGNITION OF CHROMOSOME DEFECTS. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WOULD THEN AID THE CYTOGENETICIST IN ASSEMBLING FINAL KARYOTYPES FROM VIDEO IMAGES DIGITIZED DIRECTLY FROM THE MICROSCOPE. THE SYSTEM WOULD PRODUCE PERMANENT RECORDS OF CHROMOSOME ABNORMALITIES AND WOULD PROVIDE AN ARCHIVING SYSTEM FOR CHROMOSOME ANALYSES OF PATIENTS, ALLOWING NEARLY INSTANTANEOUS RETRIEVAL OF CHROMOSOME DATA IN A PICTORIAL FORMAT. THIS APPROACH TO INTERACTIVE CHROMOSOME ANALYSIS SHOULD GREATLY INCREASE THE SPEED WITH WHICH RESULTS CAN BE OBTAINED ON A CLINICAL LEVEL, EASE THE FATIGUE WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH CHROMOSOME ANALYSIS DIRECTLY FROM THE MICROSCOPE, RELIEVE THE BURDENS ON THE TRAINED CYTOGENETICIST ASSOCIATED WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTATION, AND FACILITATE AUTOMATED CHROMOSOME ANALYSIS ARCHIVING AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IMPORTANT IN ANY CLINICAL LABORATORY OPERATION. IN ADDITION, THE FORMAT THAT WE PROPOSE FOR INTERACTIVE CHROMOSOME ANALYSIS IS QUITE FLEXIBLE AND SHOULD ALLOW RESEARCH LABORATORIES INTERESTED IN OTHER ORGANISMS AND CELL LINES TO ECONOMICALLY AND EFFICIENTLY ANALYZE CHROMOSOME PREPARATIONS. OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMERCIALIZATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROJECT ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT, THERE BEING APPROXIMATELY 400 LABORATORIES IN THE UNITED STATES PERFORMING CLINICAL CHROMOSOME ANALYSIS, AND A SMALLER BUT SIGNIFICANT NUMBER INVOLVED IN CYTOGENETICS",

INCREASED ERRICIENCY AND RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS PLACED ON THE NEXT GENERATION OF WIND MACHINES WILL CHALLENGE DESIGNERS, DEMANDING THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH FAILURES ORIGINATE AND PROPAGATE IN SUCH COMPOSITES. PREVIOUS TESTING OR WOOD/EPOXY LAMINATES HAS SHOWN THAT THE JOINTS BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL VENEER SHEETS WITHIN THE LAMINATE ACT AS FAILURE INITIATION SITES WHICH LIMIT ITS LOAD-CARRYING CAPACITY. THE DETERIMENTAL EFFECT OF THESE JOINTS IS MOST FELT IN HIGH-CYCLE FATIGUE, WHICH IS OF KEY IMPORTANCE FOR RELIABLE, LONG LIFE WIND TURBINE COMPONENTS SUCH AS BLADES. THE STUDY OF HOW A MATERIAL BEHAVES UNDER REPEATED STRESS AROUND THE SITE OF A WELL-DEFINED, BUILT-IN DEFECT IS A TRADITIONAL METHOD IN MATERIALS SCIENCE FOR GAINING INSIGHT INTO FATIGUE-RELATED PROCESSES. THE PHASE I RESEARCH WILL ADVANCE THIS TECHNIQUETHROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF A MOST HIGHLY INTEGRATED FATIGUE TEST MATRIX.

THE ROOTING MEDIUM MODULE NOW WIDELY USED AS A FINAL MEDIUM FOR ROOTING OF TISSUE CULTURED PLANTS IN PREPARATION FOR FIELD OR GREENHOUSE TRANSPLANTING IN ITS MOST IMPROVED FORM IS HIGHLY ADAPTABLE TO INTRODUCTION AT FAR EARLIER STEPS IN THE TISSUE CULTURE PROCESS. THE APPROACH ADVANCED USES THIS ROOTING MEDIUM MODULE AS A BENIGN, POROUS MATRIX AND A POPLAR HYBRID AS THE TEST TISSUE. MEDIUM RENEWALS AND CHANGES NECESSARY TO THE TISSUECULTURE OF PLANTS ARE ACCOMPLISHED BY APPROPRIATE ACTIVE ELUTION METHODS WHICH PERMIT CHANGING MEDIA WITHOUT TISSUE TRANSFER. THIS SYSTEM WILL ELIMATE ALL MANUAL TISSUE TRANSFERS, ENABLING FULL AUTOMATION OF TISSUE CULTURE PRODUCTION OF CLONAL PLANT POPULATION WITH ATTENDANT HIGH EFFICIENCY AND LOW UNIT COST.

THROUGH THESE MODELS IT WOULD BECOME POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE PROBABILITY OF CARCINOGENICITY OF UNTESTED COMPOUNDS. THE APPLICATION WOULD BE TO THOSE CHEMICALS THAT HAVE NOT AS YET AND PROBABLY NEVER WILL BE TESTED ALREADY IN CURRENT COMMERCE, AS WELL AS THOSE BEING INTRODUCED AT THE RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 1,000 PER YEAR INTO COMMERCE. OTHER APPLICATIONS EXIST AT THE DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE TO ENHANCE THE SAFETY OF LABORATORY AND PRODUCTION PERSONNEL, AND TO MINIMIZE THE USE OF ANIMALS IN RESEARCH AND TESTING. DURING PHASE I IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH CAN BE DEMONSTRATED. DURING PHASE II A REFINEMENT OF THE APPROACH AND COMMERCIALIZATION WOULD BE EXPECTED. THE METHODOLOGY PROPOSED IN THIS APPLICATION CONSISTS MOSTLY OF COLLECTION OF RESULTS OF CARCINOGENESIS BIOASSAYS, THEIR CRITICAL EVALUATION, AND MODELLING OF THE ASSEMBLED DATA BASES BY MEANS OF CONVENTIONAL MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY. THE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS EXPECTED FROM THIS PROJECT WOULD BE THE ABILITY TO PREDICT WHICH CHEMICALS ARE LIKELY TO BE CARCINOGENS ON THE BASIS OF STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY EQUATIONS TO A DEGREE NOT HERETOFORE POSSIBLE. THE COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS WOULD BE TO THOSE COMPOUNDS IN THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT INVENTORY WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED, TO CHEMICALS CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED, AND AS A TOOL IN ITS SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION.

IN THIS CONTRACT, WE PROPOSE THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF AN ALTERNATIVE TECHNIQUE OF TUMOR CELL CLONING USING GLASS CAPILLARY TUBES INSTEAD OF PETRI DISHES. THE CAPILLARY HTCFA PROMISES IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES OVER THE 2-LAYER AGAR METHOD, MOST SIGNIFICANTLY BY INCREASING THE PLATING EFFICIENCY AND THE OVERALL GROWTH RATE OF TUMOR SPECIMENS. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE LESS CULTURE MATERIAL AND FEWER CELLS ARE REQUIRED, THE ASSAY CAN BE PERFORMED MORE ECONOMICALLY AND ON SMALL TUMOR BIOPSIES. THE SYSTEM WILL BE OPTIMIZED FOR VOLUME AND CONCENTRATION OF AGAROSE, NUMBER OF CELLS SEEDED, AND THE DURATION OF INCUBATION. TUMOR COLONY GROWTH SUPPORTING ABILITY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDIA AND MEDIA SUPPLEMENTS WILL BE EVALUATED. QUALITY CONTROL CRITERIA FOR THE CAPILLARY HTCFA WILL BE DEVELOPED AND EVALUATED.

THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INCORPORATE THE EARLIER IMPROVEMENTS IN A NEW INSTRUMENT DESIGNED TO PRODUCE MORE ACCURATE SKINFOLD MEASUREMENTS UNDER THE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS POSED BY THE OLDER AGE GROUP. PRIOR TO DEVELOPING THIS SPECIALIZED INSTRUMENT, WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE PARAMETERS THAT LIMIT ACCURATE MEASUREMENT IN THE OLDER POPULATION AND THE DESIGN CHANGES THAT OPTIMIZE SKINFOLD MEASURES. CONSTRUCTION AND VALIDATION OF A PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT WILL FULFILL PHASE I GOALS.",

THE PERFORMANCE OF CERAMIC COMPONENTS REQUIRES THAT SMALL DISCONTINUITIES BE DETECTED AND EVALUATED. MICRORADIOGRAPHY BY PROJECTION MAGNIFICATION OFFERS THE PROMISE OF DETECTING SMALL DISCONTINUITIES IN A PRACTICAL INSPECTION SYSTEM. IMAGE MAGNIFICATIONS OF 100X OR MORE MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO DETECT DISCONTINUITIES IN THE 20 TO 50 MICROMETER SIZE RANGE. THIS CAN BE DONE WITH REAL-TIME DETECTORS THEREBY OFFERING THE POSSIBILITY FOR A FAST SCANNING INSPECTION. WHEN INDICATIONS ARE FOUND, A STEREO IMAGING SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE MUCH CHARACTERIZATION INFORMATION IN TERMS OF SIZE, SHAPE, LOCATION AND TYPE. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THIS CAPABILITY AND DEMONSTRATE ITS EFFECTIVENESS FOR THE INSPECTION OF CERAMICS.

THE RESULT HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INFANTS AT RISK FOR LATER INTELLECTUAL RETARDATION. HAPPILY, 80 TO 90% OF HIGH-RISK INFANTS ARE INTELLECTUALLY NORMAL LATER IN LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, NO VALID SCREENING DEVICE FOR DIFFERENTIATING INFANTS WHO WILL LATER BE INTELLECTUALLY NORMAL FROM THOSE WHO WILL BE RETARDED IS AVAILABLE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A DEVICE WOULD HAVE TWO ADVANTAGES. THE FIRST IS THAT PARENTS OF THE MAJORITY OF INFANTS SCREENED COULD BE RELIEVED OF THEIR ANXIETY AND ENCOURAGED TO TREAT THEIR INFANTS AS INTELLECTUALLY NORMAL. THE SECOND IS THAT IDENTIFICATION OF MENTAL RETARDATION DURING INFANCY MAY ALLOW A FULLER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CAUSES OF SUCH DEFICIT. THE MAIN AIM OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO MAKE A SCREENING DEVICE AVAILABLE TO CLINICIANS SO THAT INFANTS WHO WILL LATER BE INTELLECTUALLY NORMAL OR MENTALLY RETARDED MAY BE IDENTIFIED DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE. THE FAGAN TEST OF INFANT INTELLIGENCE (COPYRIGHT 1981, J.F. FAGAN, III) IS A VALID SCREENING DEVICE FOR THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF LATER MENTAL RETARDATION. CURRENTLY, THE FAGAN TEST EXISTS SOLELY AS A RESEARCH INSTRUMENT. THE SPECIFIC GOAL OF THIS PHASE I PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AND FIELD-TEST A PROTOTYPE OF THE FAGAN TEST WHICH MAY BE USED BY CLINICIANS. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE CLINICAL PROTOTYPE FOR AN EXTENSIVE CLINICAL TRIAL WILL BE THE AIM OF A PHASE II PROJECT. ULTIMATELY, THE PREVENTION OR REMEDIATION OF MENTAL RETARDATION IS MORE LIKELY WHEN EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF THE VICTIMS AND THE CAUSES OF RETARDATION CAN BE MADE. THE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF A VALID SCREENING DEVICE FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF INTELLECTUAL DEFICIT PROMISES TO AID IN DIAGNOSING, UNDERSTANDING AND, POTENTIALLY, IN PREVENTING OR ALLEVIATING MENTAL RETARDATION.",

ALTHOUGH FRANK MALIGNANCIES ARE MORE READILY DIAGNOSED, THERE ARE INCONSISTENCIES IN THE CATEGORIZING AND DIAGNOSIS OF WHAT ARE GENERALLY TERMED PREMALIGNANT CONDITIONS. IMMUNO- DIAGNOSIS MAY PROVE SUPERIOR TO THE CURRENT METHOD OF SUBJECTIVE EVALUATION OF CELLULAR MORPHOLOGY, NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF SPEED AND SENSITIVITY, BUT ALSO IN OBJECTIVITY. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COCKTAIL OF HIGHLY ASSOCIATED SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO BE USED AS AN IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL REAGENT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE EFFECTIVEDIAGNOSIS OF ORAL DISEASE. THE LONG-RANGE GOAL OF THE RESEARCH IS TO PRODUCE AN IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL REAGENT WHICH WILL DETECT ALL STAGES OF SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA AS WELL ASALL CELLS WITHIN THE TUMOR MASS AND DETECT PREMALIGNANT LESIONS. THOSE MONOCLONALS SELECTED IN PHASE I WILL BE EVALUATED IN A LARGE-SCALE PHASE II CLINICAL STUDY.",

THE PHASE I WORK INCLUDES THE ANALYTICAL DETERMINATION OF THE OPTIMAL SOURCE PLASMA PARAMETERS FOR MAXIMIZING THE NEGATIVE ION PRODUCTION RATE. ALSO, A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF THE PHASE II TEST FACILITY WILL BE PERFORMED. THE TECHNIQUE WE PROPOSE, USING NONEQUILIBRIUM ELECTRON ENERGY DISTRIBUTION, OFFERS THE ADVANTAGES OF CIRCULAR CROSS-SECTIONAL GEOMETRY, POWER-EFFICIENT PLASMA FORMATION WITHOUT ELECTRON-EMITTING HOT FILAMENTS IN THE DISCHARGE, AND INCREASED RELIABILITY AND STRUCTURAL SIMPLICITY OF SPACE APPLICATIONS.",

FROM COLLISIONAL EXCITATION OR LASER INDUCED FLUORESCENCE OF THE HE BEAM, THE ZEEMAN PROFILE OF EMITTED RADIATION CAN BE ANALYSED TO DETERMINE THE MAGNETIC FIELD. THE FLUORESCENCE TECHNIQUE CAN BE ENHANCED FURTHER BY UTILIZING COAXIAL PROPAGATION OF A DYE LASER BEAM WITH THE HELIUM BEAM. COAXIAL PROPAGATION IS READILY ACCOMMODATED BY OUR NEUTRAL BEAM SOURCE. IN ADDITION, MEASUREMENT OF THE DOPPLER-BROADENED CHARGE EXCHANGE RADIATION MAY PROVIDE A METHOD OF DETERMINING THE ION TEMPERATURE.

WHILE THESE PROVIDE ADMIRABLE TECHNICAL QUALITIES THEY ALSO PRESENT SOME FORMIDABLE PROBLEMS. THE BIGGEST OF THESE ARE THEIR HIGH PRICES AND THE AMOUNT OF CRATE SPACE THEY REQUIRE. THE PRICE PROBLEM COMES INTO PLAY AT SPEEDS ABOVE 1MHZ SINCE THESE MODULES USE FLASH CONVERTERS THAT ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. THE OTHER FEATURE ASSOCIATED WITH RECORDERS IS THEIR MEMORY REQUIREMENTS, WHICH ARE USUALLY SUBSTANTIAL. THESE MODULES WERE DEISGNED WITH 4K AND 16K MEMORIES, THE END RESULT BEINGLARGE, EXPENSIVE MODULES. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS COMMERCIAL INTEREST IN COMPUTERS AND DIGITAL TRANSMISSION AND DISPLAY OF ANALOG DATA HAS EXPANDED TREMENDOUSLY. AS A RESULT, MANY OF THE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS THAT COULD BE USED IN TRANSIENT RECORDERS ARE IMPROVING RAPIDLY. IN ADDITION, ANOTHER DEVICE THAT WILL HAVE A GREAT EFFECT ON CAMAC MODULES IN GENERAL IS THE PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC ARRAY (PLA). IT WILL PROVIDE COMMAND DECODING AT A GREAT SAVINGS IN BOARDSPACE, WHILE IN ADDITION OFFERING MORE SOPHISTICATED COMMANDSTRUCTURES. FEW OF THESE ADVANTAGES HAVE BEEN USED IN RECORDER MODULES. THE USE OF MEMORY MODULES WITH 16 TIMES THE CAPACITY, ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTERS (ADC'S) AT A TENTH OF THE COST AND WITH MUCH LOWER POWER LEVELS, DECODINGAND PROGRAMMING WITH PLA'S ALL OFFER ENORMOUS POSSIBILITIES FOR RECORDER MODULES AND SYSTEMS. IN SITUATIONS THAT REQUIRED RECORDERS BEFORE, THEY COULD NOT ALWAYS BE JUSTIFIED BECAUSE OF THEIR COST AND DENSITY. UTILIZING THESE NEW DEVICES, RECORDER SYSTEMS WOULD BECOME A MUCH MOREPRACTICAL SOLUTION. THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THESE NEW DEVICES WITH REGARD TO THEIR PERFORMANCE AND HOW THEY COULD BEST BE USED IN TRANSIENT RECORDER MODULES, BOTH IN CAMAC AND FASTBUS.

IF ONE COULD AUTOMATICALLY DERIVE THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION AND PROVIDE IT TO DESIGNERS EARLY IN THE DESIGN PROCESS, THEN THE OVERALL QUALITY OF DESIGNS SHOULD IMPROVE AND THE PROBABILITY OF MISSION SUCCESS SHOULD INCREASE MEASUREABLY. THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM IS TO UTILIZE THE JRS INTEGRATED DESIGN AUTOMATION SYSTEM AS A STARTING POINT AND TO THEN ADD TO IT THE CAPABILITY TO DERIVE THE INFORMATION OF INTEREST. THE PRIMARY EXTENSIONS TO THE SYSTEM WOULD BE IN THE FORM OF COMPREHENSIVE INSTRUMENTATION PACKAGES THAT WOULD BE INTEGRATED WITH THE EXISTING MICROCODE OPTIMIZATION SOFTWARE ELEMENTS. THE INFORMATION OF INTEREST TO A DESIGNER IS OBTAINABLE FROM THESE OPTIMIZATION ELEMENTS IN A FORM THAT CAN BE PROCESSED FOR MEANINGFUL PRESENTATION TO A DESIGNER.

BECAUSE EXISTING VISCOMETERS ARE EXPENSIVE, COMPLEX TO USE, AND DO NOT PROVIDE MEANINGFUL RESULTS EASILY INTERPRETED BY CLINICIANS, BLOOD VISCOSITY MEASURES ARE NOW RARELY USED CLINICALLY. THE POTENTIAL MARKET FOR AN INEXPENSIVE, CLINICALLY USEFUL BLOOD VISCOMETER IS LARGE. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PRODUCE AND MARKET SUCH A DEVICE, USING A PATENTED PRINCIPLE OF UNSTEADY STATE VISCOSITY DETERMINATION. IN A SINGLE RUN OF LESS THAN 60 SECONDS' DURATION, IT CAN PROVIDE VALUES OF VISCOSITY VERSUS SHEAR RATE OVER PHYSIOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT SHEAR RATE RANGES OF UP TO 100:1. A MICROCOMPUTER FITS THE DATA TO SUITABLE RHEOLOGICAL MODELS, PROVIDING CLINICALLY RELEVANT PARAMETERS. DURING PHASE I THE GOALS ARE TO REDESIGN THE EXISTING PROTOTYPE, IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY THE DESIGN AND REDUCE COSTS OF BOTH THE MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS SYSTEMS, INCORPORATING INEXPENSIVE, DISPOSABLE COMPONENTS. THE DESIGN WILL BE THE BASIS FOR PHASE II, WHICH WILL INVOLVE SELECTION AND BUILDING OF ACTUAL COMPONENTS, TESTING AND DETERMINING COSTS OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM, AND DEMONSTRATING CLINICAL FEASIBILITY AND UTILITY.",

ANY INCREASEIN VESSEL SPEED CAPABILITY WOULD RESULT IN GREAT SAVINGS IN SHIP TIME AND WOULD ENCOURAGE MORE WIDESPREAD USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY.

FOLLOWING THIS CONCEPT, THE AIQ WOULD COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF AN AI SYSTEM WITH PERFORMANCE NORMS. THE CRITICAL TASKS ARE TO SELECT A RANGE OF PERFORMANCE EVALUATION TESTS AND TO DEVELOP A MEANS OF GENERATING NORMS FOR A SPECIFIC AI SYSTEM. THE APPROACH SELECTED WILL RELY ON COMPARISONBASED PREDICTION METHODS TO ESTABLISH THE PERFORMANCE NORMS AND WILL SELECT TASK ANALYTIC PROCEDURES FOR SYNTHESIZING A PERFORMANCE EVALUATION TEST BATTERY FOR ANY SPECIFIC AI DOMAIN. SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF THE FEASIBILITY OF THESE METHODS WILL LEAD TO A PHASE II DEVELOPMENT OF A GENERALIZED PERFORMANCE TEST BATTERY, GENERALIZED PERFORMANCE NORMS, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DATA BASE TO UPDATE PERFORMANCE NORMS TO REFLECT TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS.

CLINICAL TRIAL OF AN EARLIER VERSION OF THE MAV IN 3 PATIENTS CONFIRMED SUBSTANTIAL HEMODYNAMIC EFFICACY FOR PERIODS UP TO 96 DAYS, BUT SHOWED THE PAD TO BE FAILURE-PRONE. IN LATER LABORATORY STUDIES IT WAS FOUND THAT THE BLOOD PUMP'S CONSTITUENT LAYERS COULD HARBOR CELLULAR DEBRIS, FORMING A NIDUS OF INFECTION. SINCE THEN, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW PAD HAVE RESULTED IN PROMISE OF A STABLE DEVICE, AND A NEW SINGLE-LAYER IMPROVED DESIGN OF THE PUMPING CHAMBER HAS ALSO BEEN EVOLVED. THE OBJECTIVE OF PHASE I STUDIES IS TO CONFIRM THAT THE REDESIGNED PUMPING CHAMBER IS READY FOR LONG-TERM IN VIVO EVALUATION. THE MAV, IMPLANTED IN 5 CALVES, WILL BE PUMPED ON A 6-HOUR-ON, 6-HOUR-OFF SCHEDULE FOR 6 WEEKS. THIS WILL PROVIDE A TEST OF THE ADEQUACY OF THE AORTIC SUTURE LINE. THROUGHOUT THE STUDY, CLOTTING PARAMETERS WILL BE SCREENED. THE ANIMALS WILL THEN BE SACRIFICED SO THAT THE MAV AND ADJACENT TISSUES CAN BE EXAMINED AND A CAREFUL SEARCH FOR EMBOLI",

THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL SELECT THE TESTBED IMAGES, PERFORM THE EXPERIMENTS THAT EVALUATE TOE TECHNIQUES, SURVEY THE LITERATURE ON INTEGRATING KNOWLEDGE, AND SUGGEST A PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM. THE PHASE II EFFORT WILL GO ON TO COMPLETE THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A WORKING SYSTEM THAT CAN HANDLE ONE OR MORE ASSEMBLY OR CONSTRUCTION TASKS.",

HOWEVER, RATHER THAN USING AN UPWARD PING TO FIND THE DISTANCE TO THE ICE, WE PROPOSE TO USE THE RADIATED NOISE OF THE SUBMARINE BY CORRELATING THE REFLECTED NOISE WITH THE TRANSMITTED NOISE.

THE MODEL WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO PREDICT THE DEPTH OF THE FREEZING INTERFACE, THE FINENESS OF THE GROWING DENDRITES, AND THE PARTITIONING OF DISSOLVED GAS, AND WILL COMPUTE FLUID FLOW NEAR THE ADVANCING SOLID-LIQUID INTERFACE. HENCE, WE WILL PREDICT THE POSITION AND SIZE OF VOIDS FORMED DURING FREEZING. THE RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED WITH OBSERVATIONS.

THIS SYSTEM COULD RESULT IN IMPROVED TREATMENT OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE. THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF ANTIBIOTIC CONTAINING MICROPARTICLES, 100 IN DIAMETER, FORMULATED AS A SUSPENSION IN A CARRIER MEDIA. ONE FORMULATION, TO BE USED IN THE DENTAL OFFICE, WOULD BE FORMULATED IN A PASTE. THIS PASTE WOULD BE PLACED IN THE PERIODONTAL POCKET BY THE DENTIST, USING A SYRINGE AND THIN RUBBER TUBE. THE MICROPARTICLES IN THE PASTE WOULD RELEASE THE ANTIBIOTIC FOR A TWO TO FOUR WEEK PERIOD, AFTER WHICH RESIDUAL PASTE WOULD BE REMOVED OR REPLACED WITH FRESH MATERIAL. THE SECOND FORMULATION WOULD BE APPLIED BY PERIODONTAL PATIENTS. THE MICROPARTICLES IN THIS FORMULATION WOULD RELEASE THE ANTIBIOTIC FOR ONE TO THREE DAYS. THESE MICROPARTICLES WOULD BE FORMULATED IN A CREAM SUSPENSION AND WOULD BE RUBBED OVER THE GUMS BY THE PATIENT DAILY. A FRACTION OF THE PARTICLES APPLIED WOULD LODGE IN THE PERIODONTAL POCKET OR TEETH CREVICES, WHILE THE REMAINDER WOULD BE REMOVED BY A MOUTH RINSE. BOTH FORMULATIONS WOULD CONTROL ANTIBIOTIC RELEASE BY SLOW DIFFUSION THROUGH A SUITABLE MICROPARTICLE MATRIX POLYMER.",

THIS RESEARCH IS MOTIVATED BY THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF BEING ABLE TO CARRY OUT AUTOMATED IN VITRO GENETIC TOXICOLOGY ASSAYS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED TIMES AND COSTS. OUR NEW TECHNOLOGY AIMS TO USE LARGE NUMBERS (E.G., 109 CELLS) WITH INSTRUMENTATION BASED ON OPTICAL MEASUREMENTS AND RAPID COMPUTER DETERMINATIONS. OUR OVERALL STRATEGY IS TO DEVELOP BOTH IN VITRO MAMMALIAN CELL CULTURE TECHNIQUES AND RELATED INSTRUMENTATION, SO THAT MANY MAMMALIAN TOXICOLOGY ASSAYS DEVELOPED BY OTHERS CAN BE CARRIED OUT MORE RAPIDLY AND WITH LESS EXPENSE. THE KEY IS THE ABILITY TO QUANTITATE SMALL NUMBERS (E.G., 100 TO 1,000) OF MUTANT CELLS OUT OF AN INITIAL POPULATION OF 109 MAMMALIAN CELLS, AND TO DO THIS WITHIN A FEW DAYS. FOR MAMMALIAN CELLS WHICH HAVE A TYPICAL DIVISION TIME OF 1 DAY, THIS MIGHT TRANSLATE INTO A TECHNOLOGY WHICH CAN DETECT SMALL NUMBERS OF MICROCLONES (2 TO 32 CELLS) OF MAMMALIAN CELLS. AS IN VITRO MAMMALIAN CELL GENETOX ASSAYS BECOME MORE WIDELY ESTABLISHED, SUCH A TECHNOLOGY SHOULD HAVE WIDESPREAD APPLICATION IN DEALING WITH THE CHEMICAL TESTING REQUIREMENTS NOW BELIEVED DESIRABLE OR NECESSARY.",

OXYGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE PASS ACROSS THE GAS-PERMEABLE MEMBRANE COMPRISING THE WALLS OF THE INTRAVENOUS TUBES, INCREASING THE O2 CONTACT AND DECREASING THE CO2 CONTACT OF THE BLOOD WITHIN THE SUBJECT'S VENA CAVAL SYSTEM. IN THE PROPOSED PHASE I OF THIS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORT, THE DESIGN AND MATERIALS FOR THE EPBGE DEVICE WILL BE DEVELOPED AND/OR SELECTED, A PROTOTYPE DEVICE WILL BE FABRICATED, TECHNIQUES WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR ITS INSERTION AND OPERATION, AND ITS EFFICACY IN TRANSFERRING O2 TO CO2 FROM CIRCULATING BLOOD WILL BE ASSESSED. THESE PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN VIVO USING LARGE DOGS AS THE EXPERIMENTAL ANIMAL. BIOCOMPATIBILITY OF THE DEVICE WILL BE SCREENED BY ASSESSING THE PATHOLOGIC EFFECTS ON THE ANIMAL, THROMBOTIC AND/OR EMBOLIC SEQUELLAE, AND HEMATOLOGIC CHANGES IN THE SAME ANIMALS. IF FEASIBILITY IS DEMONSTRATED BY THIS PHASE I STUDY, PHASE II WILL BE EMBARKED ON TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND OPTIMIZE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE DEVICE BY IN-DEPTH DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION STUDIES PREPARATORY TO PHASE III COMMERCIALIZATION FOR THE PRODUCTION AND CLINICAL UTILIZATION OF THE DEVICE. IT SHOULD HAVE WIDE CLINICAL APPLICABILITY TO HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS NEEDING IMPROVED OXYGENATION AND CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE IMMOBILIZATION OF PROTEINS ON INSOLUBLE SURFACES IS IMPORTANT IN DIAGNOSTIC INSTRUMENTATION AND IN VIVO MONITOR-ING. IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SURFACE ANTIBODY INTERACTIONS SHOULD RESULT IN MORE EFFICIENT APPROACHES TO IMMUNO- DIAGNOSTICS. THIS WOULD BE ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN THE FIELD OF TUMOR MARKER DETECTION WHERE PANELS OF ANTIGENS MAY BE NEEDED FOR PROPER DIAGNOSIS. THIS RESEARCH IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTIPLE IMMUNOLOGICAL TEST WITH AN ELECTRONIC ENDPOINT. THE RESEARCH WILL INVOLVE THE USE OF ANTIGEN OR ANTIBODY-LABELED COLLOIDAL GOLD PARTICLES TO GENERATE AN ELECTRONIC ENDPOINT. A DIAGNOSTIC ELEMENT WILL BE REFINED SO THAT THE ANTIBODY-ANTIGEN REACTION CAUSES THE COMPLETION OF AN OPEN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT. THIS MODEL NECESSITATES AN ELECTRICALLY INSULATING BASE SURFACE FOR PROTEIN ADHESION. A PAIR OF CONDUCTORS IS PLACED ON THE DEFINING A CHANNEL BETWEEN THEM. THE ANTIGEN IS PLACED IN THE CHANNEL. THE GOLD-TAGGED ANTIBODY WILL BOND TO THE SPECIFIC ANTIGEN, FORMING A CONDUCTIVE BRIDGE ACROSS THE CHANNEL FOR A POSITIVE REACTION. THIS NEW TYPE OF DEVICE COULD REPLACE THE CURRENTLY USED ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY, IMMUNO-FLUORESCENCE, AND RADIOIMMUNOASSAY TECHNIQUES, WHICH ARE RELIABLE BUT SLOW, TEDIOUS, AND RESTRICTED TO SINGLE TESTS PER SAMPLE. THE COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF A MULTIPLE TEST ENCOMPASS HUMAN DIAGNOSTICS SUCH AS CANCER AND ALLERGY AS WELL AS VETERINARY AND FORENSIC DIAGNOSTICS.",

TRACER METHODOLOGY USING ISOTOPICALLY LABELED DRUGS CONTINUES TO BE A POWERFUL TOOL IN OBTAINING SUCH KNOWLEDGE WITH EXCEPTIONAL SENSITIVITY AND QUANTITATION ACCURACY. AVAILABILITY OF LABELED COMPOUNDS WITH ADEQUATELY HIGH SPECIFIC RADIOACTIVITY AND CHEMICAL AS WELL AS RADIOCHEMICAL PURITY IS ESSENTIAL AND REQUIRES SPECIALIZED EFFORT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFICIENT PROCEDURES FOR PREPARATION, IDENTIFICATION, PURIFICATION, STORAGE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF SELECTED COMPOUNDS IMPORTANT FOR CANCER RESEARCH IS THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT. IN PHASE I THE SYNTHETIC APPROACHES TO LABELING A SMALL NUMBER OF COMPOUNDS OF INTEREST TO NCI WILL BE DEVELOPED TO SECURE EFFICIENT METHODS FOR THEIR PREPARATION. THE COMPOUNDS SELECTED ARE: ZEBULARINE-2-14C, WHICH CAN BE PREPARED FROM PROTECTED URIDINE-2-14C BY SELECTIVE CHLORINATION AND REDUCTIVE DEHALOGENATION; CYCLOPENTENONE-14C, WHICH WILL BE PREPARED IN A FOUR-STEP SYNTHESIS, STARTING WITH CONDENSATION OF 14C-LABELED METHYL PHOSPHONIC ESTER WITH CORRESPONDING LACTONE; MTX POLYGLUTAMATES WHICH WILL BE IN PHASE II, NEWLY EMERGING COMPOUNDS WITH PROMISING CANCEROSTATIC OR CYTOSTATIC PROPERTIES WILL BE INCLUDED IN THIS PROJECT.",

THE OFFENSE POINT OF VIEW INCLUDES DETERMINING THE SIGNATURE FEATURES THAT THE ANTI-SIMULATION TACTIC ATTEMPTS TO DISGUISE AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH THESE FEATURES CAN BE MODIFIED BY PRACTICAL ALTERATIONS OF BOTH THE RV AND THE DECOY. THIS PORTION OF THE RESEARCH WILL ALSO ADDRESS IMPORTANT THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES SUCH AS HOW TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE MULTIPLE CLASSES THAT RESULT FROM THE APPLICATION OF ANTI-SIMULATION AND HOW TO BEST IMPLEMENT THE TACTIC IN PRACTICE. THE DEFENSE POINT OF VIEW FOCUSSES ON THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED TO COUNTER THE TACTICS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATE OF ANTI-SIMULATION EFFECTIVENESS. PROCEDURES FOR COMBINING THE DATA FROM MULTIPLE SENSORS WILL BE DERIVED AND APPLIED TO BOTH EXOAND ENDO-ATMOSPHERIC ENGAGEMENTS IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DEFENSE TACTIC IN A MULTI-SENSOR ENVIRONMENT AS A FUNCTION OF THE TYPE AND THE AMOUNT OF A-PRIORI INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE DEFENSE. RESULTS WILL BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT CONTAIN THE MOST POTENT DISCRIMINATION INFORMATION AND THESE WILL BE RELATED TO THE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA SO THAT THE APPLICABILITY OF THE TACTIC TO SPECIFIC SYSTEMS CAN BE ESTABLISHED.",

TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, HOWEVER,PRESENT THE OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE TWO NEW TECHNIQUES FOR THEIR ACCURACY AND USEFULNESS IN DETECTING INJURY CAUSED BY THE EXPOSURE OF PLANTS TO GASEOUS AIR POLLUTANTS. THE TWO NEW TECHNIQUES WHICH WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE ARE BASED ON: (1) THE DETERMINATION OF THE RELATIVE VARIABLE IN VIVO CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE LEVEL, AND (2) THE DETERMINATION OFTHE COMPOSITION OF STABLE CARBON ISOTOPES ( 13C-VALUES OF LEAF TISSUE. PLANTS OF TEN SPECIES WILL BE ESTABLISHED IN POTS IN A GREENHOUSE. THE PLANT SPECIES FALL INTO THREE GROUPS WHERE EACH GROUP, FOR ITS OWN REASONS, IS OF INTERESTIN POLLUTED AREAS. THE PLANTS WILL BE TRANSFERRED IN THE ACTIVE STAGE TO FOUR OPEN TOP FIELD CHAMBERS. AFTER ONE WEEK OF ACCLIMATION IN THE FIELD CHAMBERS, FUMIGATIONS WILL START WITH A MIXTURE OF SO2 ANDO2 AT THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS IN THREE OF THE OPEN TOP FIELD CHAMBERS. THE REMAINING CHAMBER WILL BE USED AS A CONTROL WHERE THE PLANTS ARE EXPOSED TO FILTERED AIR ONLY. THE FUMIGATIONS WILL TAKE PLACE EVERY SECOND DAY FOR FIVE MIDDAY HOURS DURING A PERIOD OF THREE WEEKS. EVERY TWO DAYS (BETWEEN FUMIGATIONS)FLUORESCENCE INDUCTION CURVES WILL BE RECORDED FOR ALL PLANTS AND THE RELATIVE VARIABLE FLUORESCENCE (FV/FTOT, VARIABLE FLUORESCENCE RELATED TO TOTAL FLUORESCENCE) WILL BECALCULATED. THE PLANTS WILL, FURTHER, BE RATED VISUALLY DURING THE EXPERIMENT FOR THE LEAF AREA FRACTION SHOWING CHLOROSIS AND NECROSIS.

BESIDES HORMONES, GROWTH AND ATTACHMENT FACTORS, LIPIDS MAY BE IMPORTANT SUBSTANCES FOR OPTIMUM GROWTH AND PRODUCTION OF END PRODUCTS BY MAMMALIAN CELLS IN VITRO. IT IS EXPECTED THAT, DURING PHASE I STUDIES, METHODS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO INCORPORATE FATTY ACIDS, FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS, ALPHA-LIPOIC ACID, AND CHOLESTEROL INTO CEM WITHOUT THE USE OF CARRIER PROTEINS. PHASE II STUDIES WILL FOCUS ON FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF CEM BY INCORPORATING ORGANIC AND WATER-SOLUBLE HORMONES AND GROWTH FACTORS INTO CEM. A SERUM-FREE CEM THAT WILL OPTIMIZE THE GROWTH OF CELLS IN VITRO WOULD FIND WIDE APPLICATION IN RESEARCH AND BIOTECHNOLOGY LABORATORIES. THE COMMERCIAL VALUE OF SUCH A PRODUCT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT.",

TO DEMONSTRATE THE OPTICAL SENSOR CONCEPT, A TEMPERATURE SENSOR WILL BE DESIGNED AND FABRICATED FOR APPLICATION IN THE EMP/EMI, HIGH-TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS OF TURBINE ENGINE TEST INSTRUMENTATION. THE SENSOR CONSISTS OF A BROADBAND LIGHT SOURCE COUPLED INTO AN OPTICAL FIBER WHICH TRANSMITS THIS BROADBAND SPECTRUM TO THE REMOTE SENSOR ELEMENT. THE SENSOR ELEMENT IS A VARIABLE GAP FABRY-PEROT CAVITY WHICH MODULATES THE REFLECTED SPECTRUM ACCORDING TO GAP DIMENSION. THE REFLECTED SPECTRUM IS FIBER-TRANSMITTED BACK TO A MICROPROCESSOR BASED, COLOR DEMODULATION SYSTEM. THIS COLOR DEMODULATION IS ACCOMPLISHED BY PRISM DISPERSION OVER A CHARGECOUPLED-DEVISE (CCD). THE MICROPROCESSOR USES KALMAN FILTERING TO ANALYZE AND CONVERT THE SPECTRAL DATA TO TEMPERATURE.",

REAL-TIME OPTICAL PROCESSORS THAT COULD, FOR EXAMPLE, EMPLOY IMAGE UNDERSTANDING TECHNIQUES AND THEREBY EXTRACT AND COMBINE THE SALIENT FEATURES OF, SAY, RANGE-DOPPLER RADAR IMAGES AND HIGHLYCLUTTERED OR DEGRADED OPTICAL IMAGES FOR TARGET IDENTIFICATION COULD PROVE MOST USEFUL. IT IS PROPOSED TO INVESTIGATE IN THIS PHASE I STUDY, (A) THE FEASIBILITY OF A SPATIAL LIFHT MODULATOR THAT COULD BE USED TO MIX TWO SUCH IMAGES, AND (B) COMPATIBLE ALGORITHMS (BASED ON OPTICAL ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING TECHNIQUES) FOR FEATURE EXTRACTION, IMAGE IDENTIFICATION, AND CLUTTER REJECTION. THE VERSATILITY OF THE PROPOSED SPATIAL LIGHT MODULATOR ALSO MAKES IT USEFUL FOR COMBINING GENERAL ELECTRONIC AND OPTICAL SIGNALS, AND AS EITHER AN ELECTRONIC-TO-OPTICAL OR OPTICAL-TO-OPTICAL TRANSDUCER.

AUTOMATED CRY ANALYSIS SYSTEM AND TO STUDY THE POTENTIAL USE OF INFANT CRY ANALYSIS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF SUBSEQUENT PROBLEMS IN PRETERM INFANTS AT RISK FOR NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DELAY AND TERM INFANTS AT RISK FOR SIDS. PDS INC. HAS USED SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES TO DEVELOP A PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT CAPABLE OF ACCURATE AND EFFICIENT ACOUSTICAL ANALYSIS. DURING PHASE I, THIS ANALYSIS SYSTEM WILL BE REFINED AND SPECIFICALLY ADAPTED FOR PHASE II STUDIES. IN ADDITION, PHASE I WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASI- BILITY OF USING EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PDS INC. AND NATIONWIDE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AS THE BASIS FOR THE TWO PHASE II COLLABORATIVE STUDIES. IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL STUDY,480 INFANTS, 120 TERM AND 120 PRETERMS IN EACH OF THREE GROUPS (HEALTHY, SICK, AND SICK PLUS CNS DISEASE), WILL HAVECRIES ANALYZED DURING THE NEONATAL PERIOD. COGNITIVE, MOTOR, AND MENTAL DEVELOPMENT WILL BE ASSESSED AT 18 MONTHS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESES THAT ACOUSTIC PROPERTIES OF THE NEWBORN CRY PREDICT NEURODEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOME. IN THE SIDSSTUDY, 30,000 NORMAL-TERM INFANTS WILL HAVE CRIES ANALYZED AT 3 AND 30 DAYS OF AGE. OUTCOME WILL BE ASSESSED AT 12 MONTHS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ACOUSTIC PROPERTIES OF THE CRY PREDICT SIDS.

THIS COMPREHENSIVE \"\"DIABETES IN SELF-CONTROL (DISC) SYSTEM'' IS COMPOSED OF: 1.AN INSTRUCTIONAL AND REINFORCEMENT COMPONENT FOR COMPUTER ASSISTED HOME BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING; 2.A COMPONENT WHICH PROVIDES COMPUTER ASSISTED INSTRUCTION (CAI) ON THE INFLUENCE OF PATIENT BEHAVIORAL VARIABLES UPON BOTH GENERAL AND A SPECIFIC, INDIVIDUAL SUBJECT'S GLYCEMIC CONTROL; AND3.A DIABETES PROBLEM-SOLVING COMPONENT. DURING PHASE I, TEN ADOLESCENT SUBJECTS WILL PROCEED THROUGH ALL OF THE DESCRIBED DISC COMPONENTS. DISC SUBJECT SCORES ON MEASURES OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND DIABETES KNOWLEDGE WILL BE COMPARED WITH SCORES OF TEN SUBJECTS WHO WILL FOLLOW A CONVENTIONAL EDUCATION (CE) PROGRAM. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE DISC SUBJECTS WILL DEMONSTRATE MORE IMPROVEMENT IN DIABETES KNOWLEDGE AND IN METABOLIC CONTROL THAN WILL THE CE SUBJECTS. A LARGER SCALE EVALUATION INCLUDING ADULT AND ADOLESCENT SUBJECTS AND INCORPORATING ADDITIONAL FACTORS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN PHASE II. THE DISC SYSTEM WILL CONSTITUTE A MAJOR ADVANCE OVER THE TRADITIONAL DIABETES EDUCATION AND OTHER COMPUTER ASSISTED DIABETES MANAGEMENT APPROACHES. THE DISC SYSTEM IS INNOVATIVE IN ITS FOCUS ON INCREASING SUBJECTS' INTERNAL MOTIVATION AND PROBLEM-SOLVING ABILITIES WHICH ARE CRUCIAL PROCESSES IN COMPREHENSIVE DIABETES SELF-CONTROL.",

THE PROPOSED RESEARCH OBJECTIVE IS TO COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES OF PLANT GENOTYPES WHICH DIFFER IN TOLERANCE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS (E.G. DROUGHT AND ELEVATED CO2). SPECIFICALLY OUR EXTENDED SQUARE-WAVE, SHORT-LIVED ISOTOPE TRACER KINETICS SYSTEM AND ASSOCIATED METHODS WILL BE USED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY AND NONDESTRUCTIVELY MEASURE 10 OR MORE REAL-TIME PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO STEP-CHANGES IN ATMOSPHERIC WATER POTENTIAL AND CHANGES IN CO2 CONCENTRATION. SENSITIVITY TESTS OF THE METHODS AND TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS DURING PHASE I WILL LEAD TO A PHASE II STRATEGY TO EVALUATE AND SELECT PLANT GENOTYPES FROM ONGOING CROP BREEDING PROGRAMS ON THE BASIS OF SPECIFIC PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAITS AND ATTEMPT TO PREDICT STRESS RESPONSESOF THE PROGENY. THE TESTED SPECIMENS CAN BE RETURNED TO BREEDERS OR BIOTECHNOLOGISTS FOR REPRODUCTION BY EITHER CONVENTIONAL OR ADVANCED TECHNIQUES. EVALUATION OF NEWLY EMERGING DETECTOR AND ACCELERATOR TECHNOLOGIES WILL IDENTIFYOPTIMAL COMPONENT AND DESIGN STRATEGIES FOR A PHASE III FACILITY. COMMERCIALIZATION OF THIS REFINED TECHNOLOGY WILLSERVE BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC BREEDING GENETIC ENGINEERING, AND BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS AS A ROUTINE SCREENING AND EVALUATION SERVICES.",

IT FALLS IN THE AREA OF PREVENTION. PROBLEM DRINKERS, ALCOHOLICS, AND OTHER DRUG USERS ARE A CLASS OF AMERICANS WHO PRESENT A MAJOR HIGHWAY SAFETY PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGH INVOLVEMENT IN HIGHWAY ACCIDENTS. SUSPENSION OF THE DRIVER'S LICENSE IS A FREQUENTLY USED PENALTY WHEN THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE CONVICTED OF DRIVING WHILE IMPAIRED. BECAUSE THE PROBABILITY OF BEING APPREHENDED FOR DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE IS VERY LOW, MANY OFFENDERS CONTINUE TO DRIVE DESPITE REVOCATION. TO AVOID INTERFERING WITH THE ABILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO EARN A LIVING, THE COURT WILL OFTEN ISSUE A RESTRICTED LICENSE WHICH ALLOWS DRIVING TO AND FROM WORK OR WHILE ON THE JOB, BUT NOT DURING EVENING HOURS WHEN MOST ALCOHOL-RELATED ACCIDENTS OCCUR. IMPROVED SUPERVISION OF LICENSE RESTRICTIONS COULD REDUCE THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THEY BECOME INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS. THIS STUDY IS DESIGNED TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL DEVICE (\"AUTOTIMER\") ATTACHED TO THE CAR OF AN OFFENDER CAN MONITOR HIS DRIVING TO ENSURE THAT IT CONFORMS TO THE HOURS OF THE DAY SET BY THE COURT. THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS MONITORING SYSTEM WILL BE DETERMINED IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF PERMITTING UNSUPERVISED RESTRICTED LICENSES TO BE ISSUED TO DRUNK DRIVING OFFENDERS.",

DESIGNING SUCH FUZE IS COMPLICATED BY THE SEVERE DECELERATION ENVIRONMENT AND THE AVAILABILITY OF ENVIRONMENTAL SENSORS AND FIRING SYSTEMS WHICH CAN DETERMINE WHEN TO OPTIMALLY INITIATE THE WARHEAD AND PERFORM THE INITIATION WITH SUFFICIENT SPEED AND RELIABILITY. QUANTIC PROPOSES TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY THE APPLICATION OF TWO TECHNOLOGIES. FIRST, A THREE AXES, HARDENED, SOLID-STATE ACCELEROMETER, COUPLED WITH A MICROPROCESSOR, WILL BE USED TO \"TRACK\" THE PENETRATION IN REAL TIME IN X, Y, Z COORDINATES FROM POINT OF IMPACT. SECOND, AN ALL-ELECTRONIC EXPLODING FOIL INITIATOR (EFI) WILL BE USED TO FIRE THE WARHEAD BOOSTER. THE EFI SYSTEM IS INTRINSICALLY HARD AND OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR AN ALL ELECTRONIC SAFE AND ARM (S&A;) WHICH CAN USE ENVIRONMENTAL SENSORS FOR THE ARMING FUNCTION. EFI SYSTEMS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT AT QUANTIC. THE ALL SOLID-STATE, CAPACITANCE-BASED ACCELEROMETERS ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT BY SILICON DESIGN, INC. UNDER A SEPARATE SBIR PROGRAM.",

MAINE HAS NATIVE POPULATIONS OF LANDLOCKED ATLANTIC SALMON (S. SALAR) THAT MIGHT SERVE AS ANALTERNATE TO SEA-RUN STOCKS FOR MARINE CULTURE. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES ARE: (1) TO COMPARE GROWTH AND MORTALITYOF PRE-SMOLT, LANDLOCKED, AND SEA-RUN ATLANTIC SALMON REARED UNDER ACCELERATED CONDITIONS; (2) TO DETERMINE THE SMOLT STATUS OF ONE-YEAR LANDLOCKED ATLANTIC SALMON BASED ON PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL TESTS; AND (3) TO COMPARE GROWTH AND MATURITY CHARACCTERISTICS OF POST-SMOLT LANDLOCKED AND SEA-RUN SALMON IN SEWATER CAGES. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE OBJECTIVES, WE WILL USE COMPARATIVE REARING TRIALS IN FRESHWATER AND SEAWATER; AND TESTS OF SMOLTIFICATION INCLUDING GILL NA+-K+ ATPASE, PLASMA THYROXINE AND OSMOLARITY, SALINITY TOLERANCE, AND PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL CRITERIA. THIS RESEARCH WOULD CONTRIBUTE BASIC AND APPLIED KNOWLEDGE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY, ENDOCRINOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR OF THE LANDLOCKED ATLANTIC SALMON, ESPECIALLY SMOLTIFICATION. RESULTS COULD BE APPLIED TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF SEEDSTOCKNEEDED BY U.S. SALMON GROWERS, AND THUS REDUCE RELIANCE ON IMPORTED SALMON.",

THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO DEVELOP A TECHNIQUE BY WHICH THE INDEX OF REFRACTION OF SEA WATER MODULATES THE WAVE LENGTH BANDWIDTH OF A CW OPTICAL SIGNAL CARRIED IN AN OPTICAL FIBER; THE BAND EDGE OF THIS OPTICAL FILTER IS DETECTED REMOTELY. THE SPECIFICATIONS OF THE PROPOSED REFRACTION SENSOR ARE: 1. ELECTROMAGNETICALLY PASSIVE; 2. ACCURACY OF 1X10(-5) OR .050PPT EQUIVALENT SALINITY; 3. SPACIAL RESOLUTION OF 0.25MM OR LESS; 4. TIME CONSTANT OF MILLISECONDS OR LESS. THE PHASE I RESEARCH GOALS ARE TO FABRICATE A SPECTROGRAPH DETECTOR AND AN OPTICAL FIBER REFRACTION SENSOR, TO LOCATE AND DEFINE THE SHARPNESS AND STABILITY OF THE BAND EDGE, AND TO OBTAIN A ROUGH CALIBRATION TO COMPARE WITH THEORY. THE IMMEDIATE USE OF THE REFRACTION MICRO SENSOR PROPOSED HEREIN WOULD BE TO MEASURE DENSITY DIRECTLY TO VERY SMALL SCALES. FROM THIS WE WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO EXTEND MICRO STRUCTURE MEASUREMENTS IN THE OCEANS TO MUCH SMALLER SCALES AND TO INVESTIGATE THE STRUCTURE OF SUCH PHENOMENON AS LABORATORY SALT FINGERS FOR THE FIRST TIME. FINALLY, AND OF MORE IMPORTANCE IN THE LONG TERM, BECAUSE OF ITS POTENTIALLY LOW COST AND STABILITY THE REFRACTION SENSOR WOULD PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR AN EXPENDABLE OPTICAL FIBER REFRACTION, TEMPERATURE, AN DEPTH INSTRUMENT (OXNTD).",

THE JAMMER LEAKAGE AT THE RECEIVER INPUT IS SPREAD IN FREQUENCY BY A PSEUDO NOISE (PN) CODE AND IS CORRELATED WITH A TRANSMITTER REFERENCE THAT IS SPREAD BY AN ORTHOGONAL PN CODE, RESULTING IN VERY LOW CROSS-CORRELATION LEVELS. THE THREAT SIGNAL IS ALSO SPREAD AT THE RECEIVER INPUT AND IS CORRELATED WITH A REPLICA WAVEFORM IN THE RECEIVER, THUS COLLAPSING ITS BANDWITH.

FLIA IS COMPARABLE TO RIA IN SIMPLICITY AND IN SENSITIVITY. THE ADVANTAGES OF FLIA INCLUDE LOWER COST, REDUCED HEALTH RISK, AND THE ELIMINATION OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL. HOWEVER, THE UNIQUE AND INNOVATIVE FEATURE OF FLIA IS THAT THE ANTIGENS ARE LABELED WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF IRON ATOMS WHICH IN TURN ARE STORED IN FERRITIN MOLECULES. USING SIMPLE IRON DETECTION METHODS, THE AMOUNT OF IRON IN THE IMMUNE COMPLEX CAN BE EASILY DETERMINED TO ESTIMATE THE QUANTITY OF AN ANTIGEN AT THE PICOMOLE LEVEL. DURING PHASE I, A PILOT FLIA SYSTEM USING TRINITROPHENYL GROUP (TNP) AS THE ANTIGEN WILL BE PRODUCED. THE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: 2.TO MAXIMIZE THE IMMUNOPRECIPITATION BETWEEN ANTI-TNP-ANTISERUM AND FERRITIN-LINKED TNP, AND FERRITIN HAS BEEN SHOWN TO FORM CONJUGATES WITH MANY DIFFERENT MOLECULES INCLUDING HORMONES, DRUGS, ETC. THUS, THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL DURING PHASES II AND III IS TO DEVELOP A VARIETY OF FLIA SYSTEMS FOR COMPOUNDS WHICH ARE OF BIOMEDICAL SIGNIFICANCE.",

WESTINGHOUSE LCP, HFTF, AND MIT 12T. IN RECENT MONTHS,BRONZE PROCESSED MATERIAL WITH PROPERTIES AT LEAST EQUAL, IFNOT SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF THE OTHER APPROACHES, HAS BEEN REPORTED FROM JAPAN; HOWEVER, THIS WAS IN VERY FINE FILAMENTMATERIAL. AT VERY HIGH FIELDS, THE EFFECTS OF PRESTRESS MAKE SUCH FINE FILAMENTS UNDESIRABLE. IT IS STILL NECESSARY, HOWEVER, TO HAVE HIGH INTERFACIAL AREA BETWEEN NBAND BRONZE TO INCREASE THE DIFFUSION RATES OF JC'S. THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN TO USE TUBES OF NB AND TO HAVE THE TUBE PERFORM THE DUAL FUNCTIONS OF CONDUCTOR AND DIFFUSION BARRIER. THIS HAS MEANT EITHER POOR UTILIZATION OF THE NB OR, IF TOO MUCH OF THE NB WERE REACTED, BREAKTHROUGH OF SN AND STABILIZER CONTAMINATION. IN THIS PROPOSAL WE SUGGEST THAT THE TUBES PERFORM THE CONDUCTOR FUNCTION ONLY AND ARE COMPLETELY REACTED. BRONZE IS LOCATEDBOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE TUBES AND THE STABILIZER IS SEPARATED FROMT HE REST OF THE CONDUCTOR BY A SEPARATE TA OFV BARRIER AS IN THE EXTERNAL BRONZE PROCESS. IN THIS WAY A MUCH BETTER UTILIZATION OF THE NB WILL RESULT, GRAIN SIZE OF NB3SN WILL BE KEPT SMALL, AND THE PRESTRESS EFFECTS WILL BE MINIMAL.

THE GOAL WILL BE TO PRODUCE A DATABASE WHICH INCLUDES PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL PROPERTY DATA, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SHORT-TERM TEST RESULTS, AND HUMAN AND ANIMAL CARCINOGENESIS DATA. A UNIQUEAIM OF THIS RESEARCH PLAN IS TO APPLY OBJECTIVE CRITERIA TO THE EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES AND DATA IN THE DATABASE IN ORDER TO DERIVE A PAIR OF NUMBERS WHICH RATE: (1) THE PROBABILITYTHAT THE SUBSTANCE IS A CARCINOGEN, AND (2) THE RELIABILITY OF THE TEST RESULTS ON WHICH THAT PROBABILITY IS BASED. THESE TWO RATINGS WILL BE COMBINED INTO A CARCINOGENICITY RATIO WHICH WILL BE APPLIED TO EACH FACTOR. IN ADDITION, EACH PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL DATAPOINT WILL BE CODED WITH A QUALITY INDICATOR WHERE POSSIBLE. RESULTS OF THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR COMPILING AND IMPLEMENTINGAN EVALUATED DATABASE FOR OVER 1000 KNOWN AND POTENTIAL CARCINOGENS DURING PHASE II. THE DATABASE AND ITS ASSOCIA- TED SOFTWARE WILL BE SUITABLE FOR ONLINE SEARCH AND RETRIEVAL AND AS MACHINE-READABLE PRODUCTS FOR RESEARCHERS INTO ONCOLOGIC EFFECTS.",

THE THREE COMPOUND CLASSES PROPOSED FOR INVESTIGATION ARE SILAHYDROCARBONS, HYDROGENATED POLYALPHAOLEFINS, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, ALKYLBENZENES. ALL OF THESE COMPOSITIONS ARE KNOWN TO POSSESS GOOD LUBRICANT PROPERTIES, RELATIVELY HIGH VISCOSITY INDICES, AND ACCEPTABLE THERMAL STABILITY; YET NONE HAS BEEN PRODUCED THUS FAR THAT WILL MEET THE SPECIFIED LOW VOLATILITY/VAPOR PRESSURE CHARACTERISTICS. THE PROPOSED APPROACH WILL THEREFORE BE TO REPRODUCE STRUCTURAL ARRANGEMENTS SIMILAR TO THOSE ALREADY KNOWN, BUT OF MOLECULAR WEIGHTS HIGH ENOUGH TO DECREASE THE VAPOR PRESSURE TO OR BELOW THE DESIRED RANGE WITH SUFFICIENT STRUCTURAL AND COMPOSITIONAL VARIETY TO ENSURE THE NEEDED LIQUID CHARACTER.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE ADVANCED SERVOMANIPULATOR (ASM) SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED IN 1982 AND IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT FOR OPERATION IN DOE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE FACILITIES. THE ASM ACCOMPLISHES REMOTE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FOR A 30 YEAR LIFE IN A ZERO-MAN-ACCESS ENVIRONMENT UTILIZING A RUGGED AND MECHANICALLY MODULAR DESIGN. MORE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IS NOW AVAILABLE TO ENHANCE AND SUPPLEMENT THE PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY OF MANUPULATION SYSTEMS BUILT FOR THIS PURPOSE. ANALYSIS LEADING TO AND SIMPLIFIED MECHANICAL DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION WILL GREATLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PARTS DECREASING THE REPLICATION COST AND ENHANCING RELIABILITY. DUE TO ITS MECHANICAL COMPLEXITY, THE ASM ALSO HAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF BACKLASH. THIS CREATES CONTROL DIFFICULTIES WHICH MINIMIZES ITS POTENTIAL USE AS A ROBOT FOR REPETITIVE TASKS WHICH MAY ARISE (IE, WIPE DOWN DECONTAMINATION, FLANGE UNBOLTING, ETC). ELIMINATION OF BACKLASH WHILE MAINTAINING BACKDRIVABILITY IS FEASIBLE AND WILL BE EXAMINED IN THIS EFFORT. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOP AN ELECTRO- MECHANICAL MANIPULATOR JOINT DESING WHICH PROVIDES MODULARITY BY ELECTRICAL RATHER THAN MECHANICAL INTERCONNECTION. THIS DESIGN WOULD RESULT IN A MECHANICAL SYSTEM WITH SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER MOVING PARTS, ENHANCE RELIABILITY, AND LOWER FABRICATION COSTS. SECONDLY, BY USING A UNIQUE DRIVE MECHANISM AND ACTUATION METHOD, A MANIPULATOR WITH NO BACKLASH AND A LIFT TO WEIGHT RATIO APPROACHING UNITY WILL BE DESIGNED. WITH THESE SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS, THE MANIPULATOR WOULD BE ABLE TO FUNCTION EQUALLY WELL AUTONOMOUSLY (AS A ROBOT) OR IN THE TRADITIONALMASTER/SLAVE TELEOPERATOR ARRANGEMENT. THE FLEXIBILITY, RELIABILITY, AND ECONOMY OF THIS NEW DESIGN WILL INCREASE THE UTILIZATION OF DOE'S MANIPULATOR DEVELOPMENTS BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR.",

TISSUE PERFUSION IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS IN PLANNING AND EVALUATING HYPERTHERMIA THERAPY; ITS VARIATION AND RESPONSE TO CLINICAL INTERVENTION DETERMINES OPTIMAL COMBINED TREATMENT STRATEGIES WITH RADIO- OR CHEMOTHERAPY. YET, TO DATE, AN ACCURATE, CLINICALLY APPLICABLE MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENT HAS NOT BEEN AVAILABLE DUE TO THE DIFFICULTY OF DEFINING A PROCEDURE WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF INFORMATION REQUIRED. IN THIS PHASE I STUDY WE PROPOSE TO COMBINE TWO SEPARATE THERMAL PROBE METHODS TO PRODUCE A SIMULTANEOUS, INTEGRATED METHODOLOGY FOR THE LOCAL TRANSIENT QUANTIFICATION OF TISSUE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY, DIFFUSIVITY, AND PERFUSION. EACH TECHNIQUE EMPLOYS A THERMISTOR PROBE, EMBEDDED IN TISSUE, TO DEDUCE THERMAL PROPERTIES; THE NOVEL POINT IN THIS PROPOSED STUDY IS THE OBSERVATION THAT EACH TECHNIQUE IS COMPATIBLE WITH AND COMPLEMENTARY TO THE OTHER. ONE EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE THEN CONTAINS IN EFFECT TWO EXPERIMENTS, EACH OF WHICH MAY BE OPTIMIZED SO AS TO SIMULTANEOUSLY QUANTIFY TISSUE CONDUCTION AND BLOOD FLOW. THE OBJECT OF THIS PHASE I FEASIBILITY STUDY IS TO ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL, AND DATA ANALYSIS PROCEDURE FOR AN OPTIMAL TECHNIQUE. THESE RESULTS WILL THEN DETERMINE THE COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT GOALS FOR THE INITIAL PORTION OF THE PHASE II PROGRAM.",

PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS ALIKE ARE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE NONE OF THE EXISTING THERAPIES IS COMPLETELY SATISFACTORY. PRELIMINARY CLINICAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT PSORIATIC PLAQUES, LIKE CANCER TUMORS, MAY BE CLEARED AS A RESULT OF BEING HEATED TO TEMPERATURES IN THE HYPERTHERMIC RANGE (42C746C). PROPOSED IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RELATIVELY SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE HYPERTHERMIA SYSTEM CAPABLE OF TREATING LESIONS OF PSORIASIS AND OTHER HEAT-SENSITIVE SKIN DISEASES. THE DEVICE WILL BE A PORTABLE, SELF-CONTAINED, MICROPROCESSOR-CONTROLLED SYSTEM WELL SUITED FOR USE IN A DERMATOLOGIST'S OFFICE. THE UNIT WILL BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING TAILORED THERMAL DISTRIBUTIONS IN SKIN TISSUES BY DYNAMICALLY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY CONTROLLING THE ACOUSTIC FREQUENCY AND POWER OUTPUT OF AN ULTRASOUND TRANSDUCER AND THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER BATH THAT COUPLES THE ENERGY TO THE BODY. PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS CONCEPT BY FABRICATING A CLINICALLY USEFUL TREATMENT APPLICATOR AND TESTING ITS PERFORMANCE IN BOTH INSTRUMENTED PHANTOMS AND PSORIATIC TISSUES. KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PHASE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TRANSDUCER CAPABLE OF EFFICIENTLY RADIATING AND WITHSTANDING CONTINUOUS, HIGH-POWER OUTPUTS OVER THE FREQUENCY RANGE OF 5 TO 10 MHZ.

A COMPUTER PROGRAM HAS ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED AND PRETESTED FOR ASSESSING PATIENTS' EXPECTATIONS FROM AND DECISIONS REGARDING SURGERY. A COMPARABLE ONE FOR ORTHODONTIC PATIENTS WILL BE DEVELOPED, TOGETHER WITH QUESTIONS TO TEST PATIENT COMPREHENSION. THESE WILL BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE VIDEODISC. TWENTY SURGERY AND 20 ORTHODONTIC PATIENTS WILL VIEW THE DISC ALONE; ANOTHER 20 OF EACH TYPE WILL VIEW THE DISC AND USE THE INTERACTIVE COMPUTER PROGRAM. THESE WILL BE COMPARED WITH PATIENTS WHO OBSERVE THE SLIDES AND VIDEOTAPES WITHOUT A DISC OR COMPUTER. A FOURTH GROUP OF 20 ORTHODONTIC AND 20 SURGERY PATIENTS WILL SERVE AS A CONTROL GROUP AND RECEIVE THE TRADITIONAL PRACTITIONER-BASED INFORMATION ONLY. PRE/POST CHANGES ON COMPUTERIZED QUESTIONS OF COMPREHENSION, EXPECTATIONS, AND DECISION MAKING WILL PERMIT A COMPARISON OF ALL GROUPS. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ENHANCE TREATMENT OUTCOMES AND PATIENT SATISFACTION BY USING THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES OF VIDEODISC AND COMPUTER ASSISTED INSTRUCTION.

ALTHOUGH TARGET DETECTION THRESHOLDS ARE AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF PILOT VISUAL PERFORMANCE, MANY VISUAL TASKS IMPORTANT TO MILITARY CONSIDERATIONS ARE PERFORMED AT SUPRATHRESHOLD CONTRAST LEVELS. WE PROPOSE THAT A NEW VISION TEST CHART BE DEVELOPED TO MEASURE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN SUPRATHRESHOLD CONTRAST PERCEPTION, AND TO SHOW HOW THEY RELATE TO PILOT PERFORMANCE. THIS SUPRATHRESHOLD CONTRAST SENSITIVITY TEST SYSTEM WILL USE THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL PROCEDURE OF CONTRAST MATCHING TO MEASURE AN INDIVIDUAL'S SUPRATHRESHOLD CONTRAST PERCEPTION OF SINE-WAVE GRATINGS FOR APPROPRIATE RNGES OF SPATIAL FREQUENCY AND CONTRAST. THE RESULTING DATA WILL PROVIDE AN ARRAY OF CURVES FROM JUST-ABOVE THRESHOLD TO HIGH SUPRATHRESHOLD, THEREBY ESTABLISHING A RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL SUPRATHRESHOLD VISUAL CAPABILITIES.

SINCE RAY TRACING IS VERY COMPUTATIONAL INTENSIVE,REQUIRING HUGE AMOUNTS OF CPU TIME EVEN ON A SUPERCOMPUTER SUCH AS THE CRAY X-MP, AND BECAUSE THESE ALGORITHMS ARE NOT GENERALLY AMENABLE TO VECTORIZATION, SYSTOLIC ARRAYS WOULD BE EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING THEIR EXECUTION. THE KEY STEPS IN THE OPTIMAL DESIGN PROCESS ARE: 1. IDENTIFICATION AND ADAPTATION OF RAY TRACING ALGORITHMS SUITABLE FOR SYSTOLIC IMPLEMENTATION. 2.

IN THE PROPOSED SYSTEM, A KNOWLEDGE BASE CONSISTING OF A SET OF PRODUCTION RULES IS CREATED BY THE USER. FROM THE KNOWLEDGE BASE, THE SYSTEM CAN THEN AUTOMATICALLY CREATE A DECISION TREE REPRESENTATION OF THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM THAT SATISFIES A SPECIFIED OPTIMALITY CRITERION. FROM THAT OPTIMAL REPRESENTATION OF THE TREE, A HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE IMPLEMENTATION IS THEN GENERATED. IF THE KNOWLEDGE BASE IS MODIFIED, THE SYSTEM PRODUCES A NEW DECISION TREE THAT INCORPORATES ALL THE CHANGES. THIS MEANS THAT THE USER DOES NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE ACTUAL GENERATION, IMPLEMENTATION AND VISUALIZATION OF THE TREE. THE RESULT WILL BE A PROBLEMSOLVING APPROACH WHERE CNCEPTUAL AND EXPERT KNOWLEDGE, RATHER THAN HEURISTIC DETAILS, WILL BE THE DRIVING FORCE. THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS OF PHASE I IS HIGH BECAUSE MOST OF THE BACKGROUND WORK FOR DEMONSTRATING FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN DONE AND PARTS OF THE SYSTEM HAVE ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED.",
