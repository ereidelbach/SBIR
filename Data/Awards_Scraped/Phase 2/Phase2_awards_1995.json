        "abstract": "Abstract         Bone marrow transplant (BMT) is an extraordinarily rapidly growing field, and the number of transplants in the U. S. is expected to grow from a current rate of 15,000 per year to over 100,000 per year by 1995. This rapid expansion is due to the diversity in the types of bone marrow transplantation procedures and the number of clinical procedures that can be benefitted by a BMT. Major limiting factors in BMT therapy is the high cell number that is needed for reingraftment, traumatic procedure needed for cell aspiration, and the poor capability to handle cells ex vivo. Cells are basically frozen during ex vivo storage. Thus, significant need exists for the development of ex vivo hematopoietic cell expansion technologies. We have developed cell culture conditions under which human hematopoietic cells expand ex vivo. Based on this discovery, we wish to develop clinically useful systems to improve BMT procedures. The first step in the development of a clinical-scale system is to make small hematopoietic bioreactor systems that mimic and successfully reproduce the expansive cell culture conditions. We will develop and optimize such a prototype hematopoietic bioreactor system with Phase I funding. If Phase I goals are successfully met, we will pursue a Phase II study to develop clinically useful prototypes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The use of dedicated pulsatile ventricular support devices (VAD) for circulatory support is becoming an accepted treatment modality for adult patients requiring support due to post-cardiotomy pump failure or post-AMI cariogenic shock; the VAD could also be used as a bridge to transplant. Although temporary circulatory support in pediatric patients is being performed with ECMO or centrifugal pumps, no dedicated pulsatile VAD have been developed for pediatric application. The proposed pediatric VAD addresses this need with the goal of developing an inexpensive pulsatile device. The device is tubular in construction with integrally formed inflow valve, pump chamber, and outflow valve. The valves and pumps are actuated pneumatically. The designed stroke volume is under 10cc suitable for neonates and infants weighing up to 10kg. The device is designed to have minimal surface area and is small in size to minimize hemodilution, heat loss and bleeding complications. Phase I study will focus on in vitro and in vivo characterization of the device. The Phase II study will focus on system development leading to an easy to use device with no need for continuous attention by a perfusionist or an intensivist.",

This technology enables designers to semi-automatically model the complex and dynamic behavior of very sophisticated aerospace power systems using models comprised of a network of polynomial equations (abductive polynomial network). These networks offer the potential to: *\tincrease fault detection and isolation beyond that provided by conventional built-in test (BIT) *\tverify sensor readings and isolate sensor failures *\testimate system degradation *\tpredict failures *\tenhance system control for a variety of operating and failure conditions This proposal introduces abductive modeling and AIM--a practical supervised learning tool for synthesizing abductive polynomial networks from databases of examples. It then discusses how abductive networks can be applied to substantially increase system control and diagnostic capabilities, and presents a demonstration project to apply abductive polynomial networks to electrical power system diagnostics and control.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Intelligent processing of battlefield sensor data information provides substantial force-multiplying benefits. The timely and cost-effective leveraging of information provides a significant advantage over adversaries who do not possess comparable information processing capabilities. Among these capabilities is the ability to detect patterns and trends in sampled data. Automated discovery of causal or deterministic behavior in sampled data provides a model of the underlying system that produces the data. Such a model can then be used to interpolate or forecast the behavior of the system under a variety of operating conditions. The ability to accurately model sampled data has a wide variety of high-payoff avioncs, electronic warfare, and other military applications. This proposal presents two existing methodologies for finding causality or patterns in data. Pattern Theory provides a framework for analytically determining the degree of \"pattern-ness\" of an existing function. It has been extended to the Decomposed Function Cardinality (DFC) and Function Extrapolation by Re-composing Decompositions (FERD) methodologies, which can produce a minimal functional description from a sample data set [27]. The Abductive Information Modeler\" is a numeric machine learning algorithm suited to modeling data of a continuous nature. It has been used to solve many complex problems in the defense and commercial arenas. Areas of commonality and complementary differences are described. An approach for integrating these technologies is presented. Finally, existing and potential future applications of FERD and AIM are presented.",

We will define typical scenarios of use in several application areas, create instances of the OCU-style MTV model based on the scenarios, and compile, execute, test, and measure the instances on a variety of platforms. We will organize the results in a final report. Application areas being explored include: command and control, training simulators, engineering design and analysis simulators, real-time embedded, and factory automation. Platforms to be used include: Macintosh, IBM, and Sun. The PRISM Program at ESC/ENS is using the existing MTV model and is interested in its commercialization.

The purpose of this program is to develop the experimental and computational facilities to simulate these effects. The three major objectives to be accomplished in Phase I are: (1) To develop a method of inducing forced vibrations of the projectile. (2) To develop a computer model of the oscillation-generating medium, the projectile and projectile components. (3) To perform limited experimental and computational validation for projectiles/components in the seven inch gasgun. 3C Systems, Inc. proposes to accomplish the above by producing forced vibrations with a layered medium composed of air gaps and honeycomb layers, perform finite element modeling with COSMOS/M, and support the seven inch gasgun experimentation with parallel work in 3C Systems' Elextromagnetic Schock Test Facility.",

GAS GENERATION OF THIS MAGNITUDE CONTINUES LONG AFTER LANDFILL CLOSURE, PERHAPS FOR 15 TO 20 YEARS.  LANDFILL GAS (LFG) IS ROUGHLY AN EQUAL MIX OF METHANE (CH4) AND CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), WHICH BECOMES CONTAMINATED WITH MANY VOLATILE TRACE COMPOUNDS AS IT MIGRATES THROUGH THE LANDFILL.  LFG COLLECTION SYSTEMS ARE INSTALLED PRIMARILY TO PREVENT OFF-SITE MIGRATION AND CONTROL ODORS; REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IS AN INDIRECT BENEFIT.  MOST COLLECTED LFG IS SIMPLY FLARED TO CONVERT CH4 TO CO2, A NON-EXPLOSIVE, NON-TOXIC, LESS POTENT GREENHOUSE GAS.  ECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL BARRIERS DISCOURAGE ENERGY RECOVERY FROM LFG.  THE COST OF AVOIDED POWER IN MANY AREAS DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE CONVERSION OF LFG TO ELECTRICITY, WHILE THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY OF REMOVING CO2 AND TRACE CONTAMINANTS COUPLED WITH LACK OF NATURAL GAS PIPELINE ACCESS USUALLY CAUSES PROBLEMS IN THE CONVERSION OF LFG TO CH4.  RESEARCH IS BEING CONDUCTED TO FURTHER DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY THAT CONVERTS LAW LFG TO A CONTAMINANT-FREE MIXTURE OF CH4 AND CO2 TO SERVE AS REFORMER FEEDSTOCK FOR METHANOL SYNTHESIS.  NO HAZARDOUS SOLVENTS OR OTHER SEPARATING AGENTS ARE USED; CO2, AN ENVIRONMENTALLY BENIGN \"GREEN\" SOLVENT CONDENSED DIRECTLY FROM LFG, IS USED AS COLD LIQUID ABSORBENT TO REMOVE LFG CONTAMINANTS TO BELOW PPM LEVELS.  TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE ARE SELECTED TO PRODUCE A CONTAMINANT-FREE MIXTURE WITH THE DESIRED CH4:CO2 RATIO FOR METHANOL SYNTHESIS, ABOUT 2.3:1.  METHANOL, EASILY STORED AND TRANSPORTED FROM A LANDFILL, ENJOYS AN EXPANDING READILY AVAILABLE MARKET, AND THEREFORE COULD MAKE LFG UTILIZATION PROFITABLE FOR RELATIVELY SMALL LANDFILLS.  THE PHASE I OBJECTIVE IS TO DEMONSTRATE PRODUCTION OF CONTAMINANT-FREE METHANOL SYNTHESIS FEEDSTOCK GAS FROM LANDFILL GAS BY CONTAMINANT ABSORPTION WITH COLD LIQUID CO2.  THE AMOUNT OF SIMULATED LFG GAS FLOWING TO THE LIQUID CO2 ABSORPTION COLUMN WILL BE ABOUT 30,000 TO 40,000 SCF/DAY, A SCALE SUFFICIENT TO DEMONSTRATE BOTH TECHNICAL AND COMMERCIAL VIABILITY TO MUNICIPAL LANDFILL OWNERS AND OPERATORS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Active Control eXperts, Inc. (ACX) proposes to apply its expertise in actuator and control system design to high force, high bandwidth machine tool position control applications. ACX proposes to develop novel hybrid linear actuators which can operate at high loads (greater than 1000 lbs.) at high bandwidths (in excess of 200 Hz), and at high displacements (0.018 inches). This innovative solid-state hydraulic actuator is well suited to machine tool applications. These highly efficient actuators are designed to reduce driving voltages and permit higher displacements compared with other actuators of similar size and weight. Further, these actuators can be easily instrumented to provide important response measurements such as collocated displacement and loading. This data can be fed back to the actuator in an internal servo loop to improve system accuracy and reliability. Solid-state actuators will be designed, built and tested in Phase I to demonstrate feasibility of the concept. One of the prototype actuators also will be instrumented and internal servo loop designs to enhance the accuracy and repeatability of the actuator will be designed and implemented. A set of appropriate machine tool applications also will be identified as part of the Phase I work, as will actuator instrumentation and controller designs for the identified machine tool applications. In a Phase II demonstration the prototype will be integrated into an actual machine tool application. Anticipated Benefits: Solid-state hydraulic actuators with forces of approximately 1000 pounds, displacements of 0.018 inches, and bandwidths of approximately 200 Hz have a multitude of applications, including its intended use as a machine tool precision position control mechanism. Further, through scaling, the actuator can be used for motion control and vibration suppression applications in robotics, printing press operations, and other high static and dynamic load and high bandwidth precision applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Aculight proposes developing novel non-linear optical configurations to access any wavelength in the near and deep UV. We set a long term goal of 20 to 50 Watts of cw or ultra-high pulse rate mode locked UV output. The UV output will initially be at pre-set wavelength, and will be tunable with further development. Conversion efficiency from green to wavelength diverse UV outputs of up to 50% appear possible. The novel non-linear optical converter features an OPO in tandem with a mixing crystal. In comparison to other ring type converter geometries, the proposed configuration appears to have significant practical advantages in the area of optical/mechanical stability and control. Phase I examines analytically and experimentally the power conversion limitations of a fixed frequency UV output ring non-linear optical converter. Though ultimately driven by a diode pumped solid state laser, initial experiments will use conventional Nd drive lasers. In Phase I, a streat of cw-mode locked pulses drives the converter. To evaluate pure cw pumping and output, experiments and analysis will examine lowering the cavity losses and ring threshold. Phase I defines the design of development experiments as well as a more capable converter packate built in Phase II. The effort will have a strong synergy with other Aculight efforts, and compliments activities at the Air Force Phillips Laboratory in exploring analogous techniques for other wavelengths.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Uses of the central visual field, or foveal scotoma, due to accidental exposure to laser light or macular disease can cause serious impairments in visually aided performance. Foveal scotomas also interfere with normal control of eye reations and saccades. Feasibility is tested for using electronic image shifting from scotomatous foveal retina to intact peripheral retina, as a con\\mpensation for central field losses. A scotoma simulator already developed by the PI will safely duplicate and experimentally control scotoma size, shape, and position. Visual images projecting around the fovea, are masked in real-time, by feeding eye position signals into a computer controlled visual display, safely creating the appearance of a scotoma. A image shift system consists of copying the visual image covered by the scotoma, and re-displaying that image at an eccentric viewing position on peripheral retina. Feasibility tests use two criteria: 1) the effectiveness of image shifting in compensating for performance losses due to foveal scotoma, and 2) the occurrence and effect of abnormal eye movements created by image shifting. Independent variables include the shift image size, scotoma size, selection of peripheral viewing site, and synchrony of shifing with eye movements. The shift method is compared with unaided eccentric viewing.",

The thermoplastic in-situ consolidation process is an emerging out- of-autoclave processing technology that has been demonstrated by ADC and others to provide low cost, high performance cylindrical structures. Given the non-isothermal characteristics of the in- situ consolidation process, asymmetrical thermal stresses through- the-thickness of the composite laminate are developed during fabrication which manifests themselves in the form of warping in the case of an open-section geometry. The objective of the proposed Phase I effort is to 1) develop an understanding of the factors contributing to the warping phenomenon, 2) identify approaches by which warping can be eliminated or controlled to acceptable levels, and 3) demonstrate viability of proposed approaches in limited fabrication trials. If successful, the proposed effort will provide a low cost, out-of-autoclave process for the fabrication of large, thermoplastic composite wingskins and fuselage components.",

THIS WILL INCREASE THE POWER DENSITY FROM THE EXISTING 1 MW/CM(2) TO 5 MW/CM(2) PERMITTING TRANSITION RADIATION TO BE A COMPETITIVE SOURCE FOR X-RAY LITHOGRAPHY. TRANSITION RADIATION IS EMITTED IN CONICAL ANNULUS WHICH HAS A CENTRAL HOLE IN THE RADIATION PATTERN AND MORE THAN HALF OF THE X-RAYS ARE EMITTED AT ANGLES LARGER THAN THE ANGLE OF PEAK INTENSITY.

        "abstract": "Abstract         An effective process for recycling plastics and composites used in aircraft does not currently exist. As a result, scrap and used materials are disposed of in landfills. A chemical recycling process is proposed that will allow the components of these waste materials to be converted to valuable hydrocarbons, fillers and fibers that can then be reused or sold. The proposed chemical recycling process is a low-temperature, catalytic method that breaks polymers down into low molecular weight fractions of the starting prepolymer material. Fibers and fillers my be separated from the liquid hydrocarbons and reused in secondary applications. The hydrocarbons may be refined and used as chemicals, fuels, or polymer precursors. Initial feasibility studies have shown that the conversion process is applicable to a wide variety of commodity plastics. The proposed Phase I program is to determine the applicability of the conversion process to high-temperature polymers used as composite matrices including epoxies, bismaleimides, phenolics, and engineering thermoplastics and to identify the conversion products. These data will provide the basis for determining process economics and scale-up requirements.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A modified engine cycle based on the early intake valve closing of the Miller or the Adkinson cycle is proposed to meet the needs of the future Military Advanced Diesel Engine. The concpet involves the principle of short, effective compression with long expansion ratio to provide high brake thermal efficiency. This concept is executed by a variable timing rotary valve placed before the standard intake poppet valve. Easy starting can be had by reverting the rotary valve in phase with the conventional intake valve timing. The rotary valve and the variable timing mechanism are the only additional equipment needed to fulfill the requirements of this engine cycle. Thus, a low cost, simple and reliable high output engine can be achieved. The concept can also be used on a gasoline reciprocating engine. Since the effective compression ratio is low, the compression temperature is lower, resulting in an ideal natural gas engine, or low NOx emission engine as well. The modified Miller cycle engine can be insulated with proper ceramic coating and low specific heat rejection of 12 but/bhp-hr can be achieved. High temperature components and tribology will be incorporated in the cylinder liner, piston ring and piston area.",

Many components contain joints between composites and metals. There is a need to develop methods for predicting life of such components and then implementing the methods in software for design calculations on computers. The proposed research addresses this need. Specifically, Phase I has the objective of assessing the feasibility of a model formulated by AdTech to perdict crack growth rates associated with fabrication or service induced cracks within joints. A combined mechanics of composites, interface fracture mechanics and experimental approach is proposed. Experiments will be performed using joints of a titanium matrix composite. If found feasible, Phase II will involve data base generation, further validation and implementation of the model in a general design and life prediction methodology which may involve a probabilistic framework. The methodology will be implemented in a user friendly software package.",

Diamondlike nanocomposites constitute a new class of materials that exhibit unique combinations of technologically interesting properties including high adhesion to vertually any substrate (including metals, crystalline and glass dielectrics, plastics), excellent chemical and diffusion barrier properties, good hardness, high elasticity and flexibility, high wear reasistance, very high thermal-shock resistance, extememly low frictioncoefficient, controllable electrical properties, controllable refractive index, and good thermal stability expecially in oxygen-free environments. In earlier research, coated specimens survived a nine-month exposure to the corrosive environment at the bottom of the black sea with no degradation in structure or properties. These coatings are deposited at low temperature (300-500K), and the size of the substrate is limited only by chamber diameter (currently a substrateof maximum size 760 mm can be coated). Both interior and exterior surfaces can be coated. Additionally, the few micron thick films can be continuously graded in composition and hence properties tailored from the interface to the bulk, to attai9n high adhesion and desirable thermal conductivity in the same coating. The possibility of structural reinforcement of the substrate material also exists. Phase I work will be devoted to comparative evaluation of technology alternatives, empirical confirmation of the protective properties of the DLN especially for naval weapon applications, and development of a detailed technical design approach for a manufacturing technology.",

The co-efficient of friction of DLN is a fraction of that for DLC and diamond, and the temperature stability much higher thatn that of DLC. The composition of DBLN coatings can be controlled to provide a wide range of tailorable properties including mechanical, optical and electrical behavior. DLN exhibit excellent adhesion to a wide variety of substrates with minimal interface layer thickness, and minimal intrinsic stress. The proposed approach takes advantage of the tailorable properites of this hard, thin film coating that consists of an amorphous quartzlike and diamondlike structure doped with controlled quantities of metals. DLN coatings represent a new composition of matter that allows formation of homogeneous composites at an atomic level. The approach will potentially overcome some of the limitations of current thin film coating technologies, and provide a cost effective scalable alternative for applications requiring low friction and good wear resistance.",

However, improvements in minimized size, maximized power density, maximized life, and reduced cost are needed to meet all Army requirements. Many of the battery components required for these improvements have been demonstrated, but they have not been integrated into an advanced technology unit. Furthermore, improvements related to thickness minimization and cell stability have been related to the separator plate, but have not been demonstrated. Development of thin, porous aluminum nitride separator plates for improved LiMS batteries is proposed. This development will be based on existing fabrication technology for sintered, porous shapes. Further reduction in thickness will be obtained by improvements in fabrication as well a sintering technology. Thin separator cells will be infiltrated with electrolyte, then tested in single and multi-stack cells. All cell evaluation will be performed at the battery test facility at Westinghouse. Successful completion of Phase I will provide the required plate technology for integration with improved battery chemistry an system technology available at Westinghouse. While this technology is suitable for military applications, commercial applications such as electric vehicles will also be positively impacted.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Infrared sensors and sensor arrays are widely used in military and commercial applications such as night vision, medical diagnosis and weather mapping. Expensive quantum effect sensors, such as HgCdTe systems, must be cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures and are difficult to produce with uniform properties. A significant opportunity exists to dramatically improve detector fabrication and performance by employing thin film pyroelectric materials for the detector element. While encouraging pyroelectric properties have been reported in several ferroelectric materials, PbTiO3 is advantageous because of its high pyroelectric coefficient (40-90 nC/cm2.K at 297K), high Curie temperature (490 degrees C), mechanical and chemical resistance. PbTiO3 can be deposited in thin film form. However, unless thermal mass is minimized, pyroelectric sensitivity is severely reduced. ATM proposes to develop a thermally isolated micro air-bridge device using a novel MOCVD technique for PbTiO3 growth that will not only produce high pyroelectric sensitivity material, but also lead itself to c-axis oriented, high density array fabrication on a manufacturing scale with significantly reduced Pb toxicity hazards. The Phase II program will address fabrication and integration of high density detector arrays on silicon substrates containing CMOS circuitry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Structural composites have many applications to 2500 Degrees F and beyond, in oxidizing environments. Oxide fibers within intermetallic or oxide matrices are the top candidate systems for satisfying these conditions. Suitable fiber/matrix interface coatings are critical, but their development has suffered from extremely high per-pound costs and marginal thermochemical stability. CaF2 and LaPO4 have recently been suggested as coatings with excellent potential for both intermetallic and oxide matrices, although they have yet to be demonstrated on fibers or in composites. ATM, Inc. is ideally suited to exploit new, commercialized developments in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to address both processing and cost issues. In Phase I, ATM will demonstrate established reagent chemistry, liquid source delivery, atmospheric pressure CVD, and continuous (multifilament) fiber coating technologies in preparing high quality CaF2 and LaPO4 coatings on aluminum oxide fibers. Coated fibers will be processed into TiAl matrix composites by the 3M metal matrix group and provided to Air Force researchers for evaluation in ceramic matrix composites. Microanalytical characterization by ATM and 3M will focus on coating uniformity, stoichiometry, morphology, crystallinity and reactivity, and failure mechanisms. Phase II will address process optimization for a selected coating, in conjunction with processing by a composite manufacturer. OPTION: None submitted.",

In order for silicon and gallium arsenide devices to meet such high power densities, tens of devices must be combined to meet the voltage and current requirements. Power combining networks, extra heatsinking and sophisticated control electronics increase costs and decrease the efficiency of power conversion and control. By silicon carbide semiconductors will dramatically decrease the cost and improve the efficiency of power control circuits. Critical to the implementation of SiC power devices is the ability to control the oxide/semiconductor interface. In Phase I, we will explore the details of the SiC SiO(sub 2) interface and demonstrate a novel oxide deposition technology to enable the design and fabrication of high power, high temperature SiC MOSFETs in Phase II. In Phase III, commercial power MOSFETs as well as analog IC's will be targeted for manufacture.",

Although these materials have good thermal shock resistivity compared to other structural refractories, their thermal shock resistance is not good enough for monolithic plasma containment devices. A new approach will be used to improve the thermal shock resistance of these two materials. The approach is to prepare fibrous monoliths. In the fibrous monolith approach a cellular structure is produced that will allow stress delocalization and redistribution on a microstructural level. The fibrous monolith consists of a cellular net work of the primary material separated by an interface material. The interface material must be lubricous to allow sliding of the cells of the primary material. Localized stress concentrations can not be transferred across the interfaces. The interface also allows crack deflection fracture mechanisms to further improve reliability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Future manufacturing of integrated circuits (IC's), will require analytical instrumentation that can provide on-line process monitoring linked to real time process control. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy can be effectively utilized to meet this need. As an example, Advanced Fuel Research, Inc. (AFR) has successfully employed simultaneous FT-IR reflection and emission spectroscopy to measure the sheet resistance of shallow junctions and the surface temperature during an anneal at elevated temperature (up to 950oC) on a 2 sec time scale. This project will develop the technology for microelectronics fabrication with on-line wafer-by-wafer characterization by FT-IR, and automated real-time process control. The objective of this Phase I project is to develop a contactless technology based on FT-IR emission and transmission spectroscopy to monitor SiO2 film production. The project will employ advanced FT-IR components developed specifically for process monitoring and proprietary software which measures film composition as well as thickness with imporved accuracy compared to present methods. This technique is also intended to monitor the presence of mechanical stress as well as substrate temperature. The proposed technology can be applied to improve both wafer quality, and yields for the production of epitaxial silicon, silicon oxide, silicon nitride, and polycrystalline silicon. In addition, FT-IR instrumentation, capable of real-time monitoring has extensive commercial potential for safety, health, and environmental applications (e.g., continuous emission monitoring, ambient air monitoring, and other process monitoring applications). This project will be led by the joint venture of AFR and ON-Line Technologies, Inc. (ON-Tech). Texas Instruments, Inc. (TI) will be a subcontractor. Phase I will prove the feasibility of data collection during the production of SiO2 films by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) in a Rapid Thermal Processor (RTP). On-Tech will design an FT-IR measurement system. TI will fabricate calibrations samples. AFR will measure the ex-situ film characteristics, and develop the analysis method and software. On-Tech will design and construct the physical and optical interface",

Existing deglycerolization ssytems are labor intensive and considered \"open\" systems resulting in a maximum storage of 24hrs following washing. The washing of cells with flat sheet membrane filters has been proven effective by the Advanced Haemotechnologies PlateletPlus (TM) Autotransfusion System. They system saves RBCs and reomves >90% of plasma contaminants. If awarded, Phase I activities will include design, construction and testing of three different filter device configurations. They will include multistage continuous flow, single state whole unit, and single stage multibatch devices. Prior to testing the prototype devices, PlateletPlus (TM) filters assembled with various candidate membranes will be tested to select the optimum pore size for deglycerolization. A PlateletPlus (TM) console with modified software will control all filter devices. Tests will be performed using packaged RBCs and frozen glycerolized blood. The major goals of Phase I testing will be to demonstrate that one or more device configurations meet the following requirements: 1. Total processing time <25 minutes 2. Final Hematocrit -- approximately 40% 3. Residual glycerol <1%W/V",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose development of a 'smart' optical preprocessor that installs as an integral part of the light gathering optics of first- or second-generation forward looking infrared imaging systems (FLIRs). This optical preprocessor is based on an advanced-art imaging acousto-optic tunable filter (aka, A-O filter). These newly-configured A-O filters are programmable to seek out specific spectral features of any potential target, at video rates, with throughputs approaching 100%, and with diffraction-limited clarity. One device can be made to operate from the UV to the mid IR. This versatility far surpasses any other spectral imaging approach. Every object has (or can be given in painting) a unique IR optical signature. In our concept, emblems or 'flags' are painted on friendly targets giving unique IR signatures but still camouflaged in the visible spectrum. These paints are modified formulations of camouflage coatings. Two example approaches are deuterated-modified and IR laser dye-modified polyurethane camouflage paints. Deuterated-modification shifts the IR absorption bands around 3.4 um while IR laser dyes will provide intense absorption lines in the near IR 90.7-1.1 um). Non-friendly targets, of course, can also be directly acquired and identified using the same optical preprocessor hardware. Once their IR spectral signatures are known, camouflaged targets used by foes can be isolated from background clutter. In other missions, objects such as vegetation types (i.e. coca plants) or vapor cloud hazards (e.g., chemical, biological or carcinogenic) can also be identified through their optical signature.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The theoretical maximum energy product of intermetallic compounds Nd2Fe14B and Pr2Fe14B is as high as 64 M Oe at room temperature. However, the actual energy product achieved in the laboratory is ~50 M Oe and the best commercial magnets exhibit only ~45 MG Oe. The inability to fabricate magnets with energy products close to 64 MG Oe is caused in part by 1) an imperfect grain alignment and 2) the presence of a large amount of non-magnetic secondary phases. We have conceived a novel processing technique that would dramaticlaly reduce the amount of secondary phases and at the same time improve the grain alignment. We propose to build a magnet fabrication facility that would enable us to realize magnets with energy products close to the theoretical limit. The proposed method reduces the number of steps in production and it is therefore expected that the overall production costs would remain competitive despite the need for stringent process control. We also propose to design and construct a few prototype electromechanical devices using the high energy magnets.",

The temperature sensor's memory will be mechanically induced. The sensor will be either in an electronically resettable form, or, less expensively, in a disposable form. The proposed device will be microfabricated using integrated circuit(IC) and silicon micromachining techniques. As a result, the sensor will be electronically readable, inexpensive, and small. Anticipated Benefits: The sensor can be used in applications in which power source usage is impractical (e.g., in mobile personnell) and where expense must be limited (e.g., in shipping containers). In DoD applications, the proposed microsensor can be used for monitoring temperature exposure of personnel, food, and medical supplies in the field. Since the sensor will be small, it is well suited for such applications in which weight and size of added instrumentation is critical. Additionally, the sensor has many private sector applications; for example in shipping and tire industries.",

The software will provide numerical data to microstructural and structural models of performance. The Phase I effort will determine the relevant features to be modeled in metal-matrix composites, determine sensitivity of image processing tools to detect and quantify the relevant features in MMC's, and develop a conceptual design of a data analysis workstation for characterizing and quantifying MMC CT data. It is anticipated that a software system can be designed which will provide researchers with a user-friendly, efficient system to extract relevant features from CT data of MMC's and seamlessly integrate this data with existing modeling packages such as finite element (FE) and computer-aided design (CAD) software. The availability of such a software capability will transform CT from a qualitative tool to a powerful quantitative tool which can be used to test existing models, improve emerging models, and develop new models to predict the structural performance of aeropropulsion materials in complex, multivariable operating environments.",

A supplier of such BESOI material will be identified. The baseline will be the SiGe etch stop and strain-sensitive etch method which ARACOR has already demonstrated to be capable of producing defect-free, undoped films that are as thin as 1000 angstrom on 100-mm wafers. ARACOR will demonstrate this BESOI process on 150-mm wafers in Phase I. In addition, a fully-depleted CMOS process flow for ultrathin SOI material, a suitable circuit to demonstrate this process, and a test matrix to validate the process and circuit will also be defined for subsequent use in the Phase II program. An option for Phase I will be to fabricate the 150-mm BESOI substrates needed to begin circuit processing in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Ladar is becoming increasingly important as a military surveillance, tracking and navigational tool. Current ladar systems use a single pixel combined with a mechanical, two-dimensional scanner to obtain an image. One laser pulse must be transmitted and received for each pixel in the image and considerable processing is required to register the different pixels and assure a coherent two-dimensional image. In addiition the mechanical scanner is complex, decreases reliability and can be adversely affected by high accelerations. The staring, multiple-pixel, imaging, ladar receiver proposed herein, called the Laser Radar Focal Plane Array (LR-FPA) is an important, necessary and innovative advance over existing systems. The benefits resulting from a multiple-pixel receiver include: (1) Covering a large field of view (FOV) with a single pulse. (2) No mechanical scanner is required in many applications. (3) A high laser pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is not required. (4) Pixels are always registered, without processing.",

Using DFM, models representing causal and timing relationships between software functions, interfacing hardware and external system parameters are analyzed to produce \"timed\" fault trees which relate the values of system variables at discrete points in time. The development of dynamic, multi-valued (non- binary) fault trees represents a significant technical advancement in system safety and reliability analysis. These fault trees explicitly identify the causal and timing effects leading to system events of interest. This information can then be used to eliminate system faults resulting from combinations of software logic errors, hardware failures and environmental conditions. The use of the tools developed by this research, instead of traditional testing and verification techniques, will enable NASA and its contractors to save large amounts of effort and economic resources when demonstrating the safety of digital systems and software.",

These systems must meet stringent requirements in the areas of: (1) dispatchability, or operational readiness to support missions; (2) dependability, or the ability to perform critical functions correctly during the duration of the mission; and (3) responsiveness, or the ability to deliver computing services at rates sufficient to meet time-critical processing deadlines. Automated tools are needed to evaluate the implications of complex design alternatives in these areas of system effectiveness. Phase I research will determine the feasibility of an automated tool set for integrated evaluation of fault-tolerant avionics system reliability and performance. The tool set will consist of separate design capture, design translation, and design evaluation capabilities. Quantitative measures of effectiveness that will be produced by the tool set include system maintainability and availability, probability of avionics system failure during missions of given duration, and critical function response times and resource utilizations. Capabilities provided by existing automated tools, including the START tool for integrated reliability and performance analysis, as well as other reliability prediction tools such as HARP, SHARPE, and ARAM, will provide a starting point for the tool set specification to be developed in Phase I.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The field training of Reserve Component units is difficult because of limited training time and facilities and the difficulty in assembling all necessary player personnel. Computer wargames which allow interactive play of player personnel are a relatively inexpensive alternative and supplement to field exercises. Unfortunately, most existing simulations are designed to exercise maneuver command and staff tasks and little play is possible to exercise the full array of combat service support (CSS) tasks. The current versions of JANUS do not realistically model CSS functions and therefore, high priority units of the National Guard, such as Forward Support Battalions (FSB) are not afforded the opportunity to play CSS planning and execution. Advanced Systems Technology, Inc., proposes to modify the existing ARPA JANUS-3D wargame to permit exercise to two critical combat service support functions to demonstrate the utility of using JANUS-3D to training FSB command and staff personnel. The proposed modifications incorporate areas of medical support and resupply of high-use Field Artillery ammunition. The modifications will possess necessary granularity and fidelity to exercise personel, allow for play of medical and ammunition resupply impacts on maneuver operations, and permit assessment of JANUS-3D wargame training capability in a UNIX environment. Anticipated Benefits: Development of a JANUS-3D model for use in training National Guard Forward Support Battalions and use of the 3D capability in other military and civilian simulations.",

THE TIME LAG CAUSES POWER OUTPUT FLUCTUATIONS THAT NECESSITATE OVER-DIMENSIONING OF ROTOR, TRANSMISSION, AND GENERATORS TO OBTAIN A SATISFACTORY SERVICE LIFE.

THE ADAPTIVE CONTROL SYSTEM WILL PITCH THE ROTOR BLADES IN ANTICIPATION OF A GUST (FEED-FORWARD), RATHER THAN AFTER ITS ARRIVAL.  THE RESULTANT MORE STABLE ROTOR POWER REMOVES THE NEED FOR DOWN RATING OF THE EQUIPMENT LEADING TO GREATER ENERGY CAPTURE AND FEWER START-STOP CYCLES.  FEED-FORWARD CONTROL IS INHERENTLY STABLE.

THE ADAPTIVE CONTROLLER ITSELF, IS DESIGNED TO INFLUENCE BLADE PITCH WITHOUT BECOMING PART OF THE STABILITY-SENSITIVE PITCH CONTROL FEED-BACK LOOP.  THUS, THE LOOK-AHEAD ADAPTIVE CONTROL SYSTEM (LACS) CAN BE RETROFITTED TO EXISTING MACHINES, WITHOUT AFFECTING THEIR EXISTING CONTROL SYSTEMS.  PHASE I IS DEDICATED TO PROOF OF CONCEPT TESTING.  CONTROL ALGORITHMS ARE DEVELOPED USING COMPUTER SIMULATION.  THEY ARE TESTED BY USING AN EXISTING ACOUSTIC WIND SENSOR FACING UPWIND FROM THE FOOT OF THE TOWER OF THE WIND TURBINE USED FOR TESTING.  IN PHASE II, THE SYSTEM WILL BE DEVELOPED INTO A COMPACT UNIT FOR COMMERCIAL INSTALLATION ON THE HUB OF WIND TURBINES.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The process of designing and evaluating advanced aircraft coatings can be made more efficient, more robust, and less expensive through application of highly accurate and flexible computer models. The General Scattered Light (GSL) model is such a signature analysis tool, but its potential is difficult to access by untrained or infrequent users, seriously limiting its value. We propose to overcome this limitation through the application of an OSF/Motif-compliant graphical user interface to GSL. The interface will build on an existing interface for the SPIRITS/ACI model, and will portable to most Unix/X-windows platforms. Aerodyne Research developed te HARDBODY/GSL code (an essential component of GSL), created the SPIRITS/AC1 user interface, has extensive experience in integrating SPIRITS model components and is therefore uniquely positioned to bring usability to GSL without restricing its capabilties. The improved access to model functionality thus achieved will save analysts significant amounts of time and effort when evaluating the signature control capabilties of proposed coatings.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Development of advanced diagnostic techniques and spray characterization methodologies are essential to the understanding of the complex spray process and for validating state-of-the-art CFD codes that are available for describing the spray process. Novel diagnostic techniques and measurement schemes have been proposed for evaluation in this proposal. The application of the well-established phase Doppler interferometry to the characterization of dense rocket injector sprays requires the ability of PDPA signal processors to reliable detect the simultaneous presense of multiple particles within the measurement probe valume, and accurately estimate the size and velocity of each of the multiple particles. The feasibility of using a frequency domain processor, namely, the Doppler Signal Analyzer (DSA) will be evaluated in this program. Also, the integration of the PDPA with another newly evolving diagnostic, namely, rainbow refractometry/ thermometry, for the reliable measurement of droplet temperatures, siz, and velocity in complex reactive sprays will be investigated in this program. The development of improved rainbow signal processing methodologies is important for such an application. During the Phase I program, the feasibility of extending rainbow refractometry for studying liquid-liquid mixing and droplet collision/coalescence will also be undertaken. Finally, a novel fluorescent tagging technique will be evaluated for the purpose of studying gas-gas mixing in gaseous rocket injectors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Aeronix Phase I task will address the problem of incorporating Imagery/High Speed Fleet Broadcast (HSFB) Receive Only Capability into the Multi-Mission Advanced Tactical Terminal (MATT) System. The significance of this effort is providing additional capability for field users of the MATT system. The MATT system connects military platforms with secure communications networks to provide tactical intelligence information to a variety of users. The current Built 1 MATT design supports UHF line-of-sight and/or UHF satellite communications with reception, decryption and data processing functions for the TADIXS-B and TRAP data links. Imagery uses compression/decompression techniques to transmit video images over limited bandwidth links. HSFB is an upgrade to the current Fleet Broadcast System (FSB) which will operate in the HF frequency band or narrowband in the UHF band. HSFB supports time division multiplexing of multiple data sources into a common data stream at up to 19200 bps. Incorporations of the HSFB UHF signal and imagery data will be addressed by Aeronix Phase I task. Incorporation of Imagery/HSFB in the core MATT system must be done without adversely affecting system performance. The Phase I task will identify the system requirements associated with insertion into MATT. Architecture tradeoffs will be performed and a top level design will be developed. This design will reflect the baseline for the Phase II prototype kit development (build, fabrication, assembly, checkout and integration. )",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We will develop rapid, cost-effective methods for detecting drug resistance in humanimmunodeficiency virus type l (HIV-l) isolates by analyzing the DNA sequences of patient samples. Thehealth of HIV-l/AIDS patients may be better maintained through lower toxicity and more appropriateantiviral use. All currently approved HIV-l antivirals are targeted against reverse transcriptase (RT).Specific mutations in RT confer resistance to these antivirals. The aim of both phases of this SBIRproposal is to develop DNA chips to detect resistance conferring mutations in RT from clinical samples.In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by 1) designing a set of overlapping DNAprobes that corresponds to the most common Ziovudine (AZT) resistance conferring mutation site in RT,2) synthesizing DNA chips containing arrays of these probes using light directed parallel chemicalsynthesis, 3) hybridizing fluorescently labeled target DNA to the chips, and 4) discriminating resistantand sensitive DNA sequences at this site. Completion of these Phase I goals will demonstrate thefeasibility of using DNA chips to detect and monitor mutations in HIV-1 that confer resistance toapproved and investigational therapeutics. In Phase II we will extend the DNA chip design to detect allknown mutations in RT that confer resistance to approved HIV-l antivirals and investigate the sensitivityof the assay to mixtures of viral genotypes. In Phase Ill, we will test the chips in a clinical laboratorysetting and investigate DNA chips to resequence the entire pol gene. This will allow application of thechips to detecting mutations that arise in response to investigational therapeutic compounds. Successfulcompletion of the research will lead to an effective diagnostic for resistance conferring mutations to thepol gene and permit the application of the technology to other HIV-l genes.",

THE AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT SENSITIVE FOR THE DETECTION OF THE VIRUSES ASSOCIATED WITH LEAFROLL DISEASE (LD). THERE IS A NEED FOR EARLY AND ACCURATE DETECTION OF THE VIRUSES CAUSING LD TO PRODUCE VIRUS FREE PLANTS. THE AVERAGE COST OF REPLANTING GRAPEVINES DUE TO VIRUS INFECTION COULD REACH $75,000 AN ACRE IF THE LOSS OF PRODUCTION AND WINE SALES IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The focus of the Phase I work proposed herein is the preliminary design of a Coherent Phase Cavitation Monitoring System (CPCMS) for turbomachinery. Cavitation is the process of boiling water which occurs when local hydrodynamic pressures in the areas of accelerated flow drop below the vapor pressure of the fluid. When cavitation occurs on the turbopumps for liquid rocket engine propulsion systems, it can i) severely degrade the overall system efficiency, ii) cause excessive structural vibration, and iii) create erosion damage to the turbopump blades. The proposed Coherent Phase Cavitation Monitoring System will utilize our proven innovative signature analysis techniques to accurately detect the cavitation inception point (when it occurs), severity (magnitude), and location, with an on-line, continuous monitoring (stand-alone) system. The ultimate effectiveness of this system will be attributed to its unique signal processing ability to optimally extract cavitation generated signature without being subjected to the commonly encountered high frequency discrete interference. The Phase I effort will focus on the overall system design; sensors, data acquisition and evaluation of optimal signal processing techniques. The end result will be the overall Cavitation Monitoring System design to be used by both NASA and industry for online cavitation monitoring of turbomachinery systems.",

Global competition in manufacturing, limitations in fiscal and physical resources, ecological constraints, and technically challenging mission goals require that productivity be increased in the design, fabrication, and utilization of new or improved materials. The technical approach is based on unified learning and interpretation of combined process and product composition data in terms of resulting product properties. The approach builds on the results of two successful prior technical efforts. One is the CAD/Chem methodology by AI WARE, Inc. for exploring relationships between product formulation and product properties. CAD/Chem is based on neural-net computing and evolutionary programming. Another contributing methodology is the QPA work (US Patent #5032525) relating process sensor data, process control actions and product properties. The result of this work will be a methodology for building material models for interpolation and extrapolation from existing experimental data. The models will be accurate and useful because they will realistically incorporate process information instead of just nominal compositions; structure will be included in the model implicitly and explicitly if feasible. The models can be used to predict and discover. OPTION TASK: None submitted.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The project objective is to test the feasibility of new network protocols for integration of a large collection of widely distributed heterogeneous databases and object data respositories into a unified system. Data contained in these databases will include text, graphics, sound, video, etc. The project will provide 2 kinds of services: 1. Index services to increase the ease and efficiency of locating information. 2. Retrieval services to present and conditionally deliver the selected data to the user. This project will simplify the task of accessing widely distributed databases and reduce both the costs and the time required to search them. The project speeds searching by building a mesh of index servers. This allows very rapid location of relevant resources, and the potential to keep the indices constantly updated. The project facilitates access and retrieval by caching resources located by a query, and allows the user to preview them before downloading them over low-bandwidth network links. The user sees a unified system instead of a large collection of databases. Anticipated Benefits: The government and private sectors can use this system to integrate databases on an enterprise-wide or even industry-wide scale. In addition, organizations can use the idexing service to track individual documents on an enterprise-wide basis or to provide a virtual searchable library of all of the organizations documents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Hybrid rocket propulsion systems are attractive because they use a single fluid (LOX), and avoid the high injector part count of dual fluid propulsion systems. However, the hole drilling costs associated with fabricating the injectors can be large, and the small holes that are desirable to achieve optimum atomization can be either too expensive or impossible to produce. We propose a novel injector fabrication method that avoids expensive laser drilling and \"platelet\" processes, and will result in injectors with superior atomization performance. These injectors will atomize liquid oxidizer into an evenly distributed spray of very small (30 microns) droplets that will vaporize with decomposed solid fuel gases. The innovation lies in a new way to form very small, uniform, cylindrical holes in a thick (0.02 to 5 cm) metal injector plate. This fabrication process, developed by Alabama Cryogenic Engineering, Inc. (ACE), is based on a technique originally used in the fabrication of cryogenic heat exchangers.",

Both assessment of bone support and thedetection and measurement of small changes in bone and soft tissues are fundamental tot he intraoralexamination. The need for improved image resolution with minimal patient exposure has long beenrecognized. In conventional X-ray detection media, such as thick phosphors and film screens, thereexists a problematic tradeoff between the increasing thickness and decreasing spatial resolution due tolateral light spreading. Current X-ray sensors therefore limit the effectiveness of many radiographicprocedures and necessitate unduly high patient exposure. To address this situation, we will develop anovel imaging sensor based on a structured CsI scintillating plate coupled to a large area charge-coupleddevice (CCD). This microstructures plate consists of micron-sized columnar crystal structures whichprevent lateral spreading of the scintillation light through the process of total internal reflection. Fordetecting dental X-rays with high resolution, the proposed concepts allows a high detection efficiencywithout sacrificing image quality. A large area, novel scintillation plate coupled to a suitable large-areCCD will exhibit 99% detection efficiency, excellent dynamic range, and high spatial resolution. Theseare desirable properties for high contrast intraoral imaging procedures such as digital subtractionradiography for accessing small progressive alveolar bone loss.",

Unfortunately, the spatialresolution of mammograms taken with existing systems is still below that needed to allow visualizationof the very small tumors associated with incipient cancer. The fundamental factor limiting the spatialresolution of film mammograms is not the spatial resolution of the film itself, but rather the convertorphosphors which are included in the film cassette to provide the sensitivity needed to allow reasonablefilms to be made without subjecting patients to unacceptable levels of radiation. We will develop a newmammographic film cassette which will greatly improve the spatial resolution and clarity of images takenwith existing film radiography systems. This cassette, which will be readily exchangeable with existingunits, will contain an advanced convertor phosphor capable of providing the required sensitivity withoutthe present deterioration of the spatial resolution now caused by the existing convertor layers. With thiscassette, it will be possible to take greatly improved mammograms with existing equipment and withno increase in patient dose.",

MODELER USES ADVANCED PETRI NET MODELS OF COMMUNCICATIONS, COMPUTERS, AND CONCEPTS OF OPERATION TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE ALTERNATIVES ON MISSION EFFECTIVENESS AND OPERATOR WORKLOAD. ALPHATECH PROPOSES USING MODELER TO PROVIDE A QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF THE C3 SYSTEMS SUPPORTING THE MILITARY AIRLIFT COMMAND (MAC). IN PHASE I, WE WILL MODEL, SIMULATE, AND ASSESS THE PERFORMACE OF C3 SYSTEMS SUPPORTING WING-LEVEL MAC OPERATIONS. IN PHASE II, WE WILL DEVELOP A FULL-SCALE MODEL OF MAC C3 OPERATIONS FORM THE WING-LEVEL THROUGH THE NAFS TO HQ MAC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Under the performance levels currently achievable for automated target-recognition (ATR) systems, the human operator plays an essential role in screening ATR detections and rejecting false alarms. A critical advantage of human operators over ATR systems is their ability to make use of situation awareness in identifying targets. ALPHATECH proposes a research program to identify the critical parameters that influence the effectiveness of a human working with an automated system to maintain situation awareness in order to detect, identify, and acquire targets. We will build on the results of an investigation already underway at ALPHATECH, sponsored by the Army Research Laboratory Human Research and Engineering Directorate, on the design of effective displays for aided target-recognition systems. This research concentrates on human-ATR performance in context-free target-recognition decisions. The completed work will provide a starting point for the proposed new effort, which will introduce the critical factors of context and situation awareness into the target-recognition decision. In Phase I we will develop hypotheses, conduct pilot experiments using ALPHATECH's Macintosh-based ATR-Interface Testbed, and prepare an Experiment Plan for Phase II based n the results of the pilot experiments.",

Currently, only costly Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems can achieve 9 ppm NOx emissions.  Alternative and inexpensive low NOx burners, that can meet the regulations without SCR, are urgently needed by the utilities industry.\r \r Altex Technologies Corporation has identified the Minimum Emissions Burner System (MEBS) that has the potential to achieve very low NOx at low cost.  Phase I test results have shown the ability of MEBS to reduce NOx to below 9 ppm.  Most importantly, these results are achieved at a much lower cost than SCR, of ultra-low-NOx burners under development.  Using the Phase I test results and cost data, it was estimated that the MEBS would be 70 to 90 percent lower in cost-to-remove-a-ton-of-NOx than FGR-based burner and SCR, respectively.  This substantial cost advantage will drive the commercialization of the MEBS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Our company will develop an in vitro tissue culture system which will permit studies of drugs'capability to enhance production of fetal hemoglobin. The Investigator stated that increased fetalhemoglobin in cells of patients with beta-hemoglobinopathy ameliorates the clinical symptoms of theunderlying disease. Several pharmacologic agents have been used to stimulate HbF synthesis duringrecent years. Treatment of patients with 5-azacytidine and hydroxyurea has resulted in higher fetalhemoglobin levels. Despite this, the clinical benefit has not been clearly established. Most agents whichhave been employed are either toxic or have been implicated in carcinogenesis. Therefore there isconsiderable interest in identifying less toxic agents which have potential to increase fetal hemoglobin.Thus far, only a handful of these agents have been tested, mainly due to the lack of an appropriateexperimental system that allows a rapid and accurate determination of the effect on hematologic cells.The Investigator indicates he has recently developed a novel, two-phase liquid culture system forgrowing erythroid progenitors derived from the peripheral blood of normal individuals and patients withhemoglobinopathies. He states that this system has proved to recapitulate in vitro many of thehematologic effects of hydroxyurea in vivo, including the stimulation of fetal hemoglobin production.The purpose of this research is to utilize this methodology for measuring total and fetal hemoglobin. Hewould employ the method for mass screening of agents to determine their fetal hemoglobin stimulatingpotential. The ultimate goal of these studies is to identify drugs with little toxicity which have asignificant potential for stimulation of fetal hemoglobin. He intends to optimize the conditions of theirculture system for stimulation of hemoglobin production and then screen various agents to determinetheir effects. Subsequently, he will use the methodology to study the modes of action of agents whichappear successful in stimulating fetal hemoglobin production.",

Phase I of the project willconduct feasibility study for the development of a non-isotopic sensitive assay to detect the deletionsof five frequently occurring genotypes of alpha-thalassemia using differential PCR. The Investigator willuse newly developed DNA/PCR mediated color complimentary assay which they developed to test driedblood samples on filter papers. These will be obtained from patients with alpha thalassemic disorders.The specimens will be made available to them by Dr. Griffin Rodgers, the Chief of the MolecularHematology Unit at the National Institutes of Health. We will develop a diagnostic kit for the detectionand quantification of hemoglobin alpha-genes in patients with alpha-thalassemia. The kit will be usedfor screening potential carriers with alpha-thalassemia in the United States, Southeast Asia andSouthern China. This should identify patients at risk of having offspring with symptomatic alpha-thalass-emia disorders. The Investigators note correctly that current screening methods are not practical forwidespread use and do not differentiate different types of alpha-thalassemia syndromes. In pursuit ofthe above, they plan to conduct studies on a micro-DNA-PCR assay to detect and differentiate deletionsof alpha-hemoglobin genes from dried blood samples. A method for using dried blood samples will beuseful in performing field studies. They then plan to establish the feasibility of a DNA-PCR mediatedcolor complementary assay to detect hemoglobin alpha gene deletions from dried blood samples and tocombine these two methodologies in to a simple and sensitive diagnostic kit for the alpha-thalassemias.Preliminary work is provided to show the feasibility of the methodology. In these experiments, theydemonstrated that deletion of hemoglobin gene alpha1 or alpha2 can be determined using three sets ofprimers from alpha thalassemia syndrome patients by differential PCR. In preliminary studies, they usedthis method to examine the hemoglobin alpha gene status from nine normal subjects and sevenalpha-thalassemia patients. These studies show that they can clearly differentiate alpha gene deletionsin these patients. They can be differentiated by measuring the band intensity of the target chains(alpha1, alpha2) and reference chain (beta-actin) after PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis. Theyalso have applied PCR mediated color complimentary assays on several normal subjects and found thisPCR mediated CCA can be used as a rapid sensitive method to detect alpha gene deletions by omittinggel electrophoresis. They postulate that after the assay is improved and stabilized, it would be auseful method of establishing clinical diagnoses in this disorder.",

This cell line was derived from a patient in China and is the only NPC cell line that has been adapted to grow in the absence of serum. Preliminary evidence has established that the CNEI cell line grows by an autocrine mechanism and that CNEI CM contain bFGF and possibly three other novel growth factors that may mediate in part the autocrine growth of the CNEI cell. We also have identified a growth inhibitory activity in CM that blocks growth factor stimulated 3T3 cell growth. Our goals our to purify and characterize both growth stimulatory and inhibitory activities for CNE1 CM by established methodologies, to characterize these factors by multiple criteria, and to establish role(s) of these factors in the autocrine growth of CNE1 cells. Phase I will be directed to identifying and purifying novel activities to the extent possible within the 6 months available. These new factors will be detection of human NPC nasopharyngeal cancer in primary biopsy and in metastatic tissues and perhaps of antigen in blood for early detection as our long- term goals. These factors also will be used to develop reagents as possible therapeutics. It is hoped to provide new approaches to diagnosis and treatment of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",

In comparison to traditional mechanical boot style de-icing systems, electrical de-icing systems are considered. One such candidate is a novel electrical thin film resistive de-icing system, which shows potential to lower the RCS levels associated with main rotor blade systems. This de-icing approach is a modified form of resistive heating. The resistive element is comprised of a thin sheet of resistive material in the areas of ice accretion on the rotor blade surfaces. In contrast to traditional resistive heating where highly conductive wires are used, a film of resistive material can be used to achieve the desired low observable (LO) specifications. This approach would be applicable as both an ice prevention technique and a de-icing technique. Basic evaluation of this approach will be performed through numercial and experimental investigation. Comparisons will be made to the traditional mechanical and electrical de-icing systems with various signature reduction techniques to assess the viability of the thin film resistive de-icing system.",

The instrument, an atmosphericpressure chemical ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer (APCI-TOF-MS), will provide for theefficient ionization and delivery of analyte species to a mass sensitive detector with electronic integratingcapabilities. Various chromatography conditions (flowrate, buffer concentration, solution conductivity)will have minimum impact on the performance or reliability of the instrument by virtue of a specialultrasonic nebulization inlet system which has been specifically engineered for the delivery of liquids toanalytical instruments. As a package, the combination of the ultrasonic nebulization system and theAPCI-TOF-MS will provide solvent-independent operation over flowrates ranging from capillaryelectrophoresis range to microbore LC range (0.1- 400 mu l min-1).

The hydrodynamic forces experienced by the UUV when it is near the submarine are significantly different from those it experiences when it is far away. In order to design a successful control system for the UUV, therefore, a method is needed that can predict these hydrodynamic forces when the two bodies are close together. The objective of the proposed effort is to develop a capability to predict the hydrodynamic loads and trajectories of a UUV and submarine while operating in close proximity and possibly colliding with each other. The basis of the proposed effort would be an existing unsteady computer code, USAERO, which already has a very general capability for computing flows about multiple body configurations in arbitrary motion. Under the proposed Phase I effort, certain modifications would be implemented which would demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. Further improvements would be identified for a Phase II follow-on effort that would productionize the method as a useful and effective tool in the design environment.",

This insturment will be used for the mreasurement of the reflectances of both man-made and natural materials using ambient solar illumination. The preliminary functional requirements for this spectrometer are as follows: wavelength range from 1.0 to 2.5 um with a spectral resolution of at least 10 nm; weigh less than 10 pounds exclusive of batteries; To have a minimum signal-to-noise ratio of 600:1 at 2200 nm, 30% reflectance, for a single half second integration time and 34 degree solar zenith angle as defined by the Lowtran-7 atmospheric model; To have a dynamic range sufficient to measure surface radiance at 0 degree solar zenith angle and 100% reflectance; Acquire all wavelengths simultaneously; to operate at temperatures as low as -20 degrees C; and, to be radiometrically calibrated and maintain caliabratin under field conditions. In order to test aspects of the proposed design, a breadboard instrument will be fabricated and tested. The results of these tests will be used to finalize an instrument design for fabrication in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Current Army projects, the Intelligent Vehicle Highway System, and the Unmanned Ground Vehicle project require automated signal processing and information processing techniques that distinguish various types of vehicles in real-time. Tasks, such as distinguishing 3-axle trucks from 2-axle trucks or trucks from cars, require image understnding, artificial intelligence, and high performance computing. We proposed to use the advanced processing architecture of the Image Understanding Architecture (IUA) in an AI paradigm that combines these various forms or processing. In particular, we proposed to utilize the IUA for recognizing vehicle types from multisensor data fusion, and then using sensor and domain knowledge to control the extraction, grouping, and matching of image features against stored abstract models fo the various vehicle types. In Phase I, we will use static images of military targets to experiment with extracting various image features such as lines, arcs, and regions from both visible and IR images. These features will be perceptually organized to form sysmbolic descriptions of complex imaghe events. Model matching algorithms will be developed to classify the image events based on abstract models of known vehicles. This approach will be tested by measuring the accuracy and speed of the model matching process on the IUA.",

Efforts investigating machine implementations of foveal vision typically use polar sampling, which hampers signal processing, gaze control, and overall system development by yielding non-hierarchical data structures which are difficult to build and process. The proposed program will develop a computational Hierarchical Foveal Machine Vision (HFMV) sensor for Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) with monolithic spactiotemporal filtering, electronic gazing, and semi-parallel readouts. The sensor topology will support existing HFMV techniques, including multiacuity vision algorithms and gaze control, and many conventional hierarchical algorithms and processing hardware.

Everyday mishaps assume great importance for elderly persons because the victims may be unable to respond actively. These people may need varying levels of surveillance for their own health, thereby, reducing their independence. Current monitors are insufficient because they require active participation by the user. We will construct a home monitoring system to provide this surveillance and extend its user's independence. The monitoring system will examine the status of ordinary activities such as light use and door position, combine these with clock time to provide alarms, and report alarms to a designated individual or emergency services. The system will be constructed from off-the-shelf components and will be non-intrusive and non-interactive. The work consists of system design, prototype construction and installation in a household, data collection and data analysis. The work will demonstrate that the prototype system can collect data in ordinary households and combine the data to form alerts. Phase II will see further research into the best combination of sensors for a fieldable system suitable for extended use. The system will be marketed, probably through a licensing agreement, in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A batteryless and wireless sensor for intrusion detection and assessment of threats which requires no battery, external power or wiring is proposed. These types of sensors derive energy from passing vehicles or persons, and indicate their presence, location, speed, etc., via a self-generated short-range radio signal. These sensors require no maintenance, and can be inconspicuously placed in windows, doors, and other entry locations. They may be used for fixed and mobile assets. The first phase of the proposed program identifies newly developed technology that can be used to meet a variety of U.S. Nuclear security applications. Improvements in materials, electronics, and manufacturing techniques will permit rapid sensor development for testing. Requirements for these systems will be investigated and new types of sensors based upon different phenomenology will be identified. Advanced feasibility models will then be built and tested. the sensors will be designed to communicate via RF to an existing low-cost multi-channel receiver. Phase I will identify innovative and very low-cost designs for batteryless sensors. Phase II will take the selected designs to a pre-production status where they can be rapidly transitioned into Phase III for commercialization. The use of batteryless and wireless sensors offers savings in purchase price, installation, maintenance and repair. The elimination of wiring is extremely attractive for nuclear weapon facility and home/business security systems. This is particularly true of existing facilities where the expense of wiring is generally cost prohibitive and cosmetics are a concern. These sensors can be used in countless applications for detecting the presence of intruders, vehicles, and other possible threats. Due to their inconspicuous nature and very low-cost, law enforcement agencies will find them very attractive.",

(ANRO) over the past 10 years now provide a firm foundation for advanced communication system applications, including video, voice, data and ranging information in an LPI/D waveform. A UWB data link is proposed to meet the requirements for a Wideband Covert Airborne Radio (WCAR) capable of providing wind dropsonde and two-way air-to-air communication requirements. ANRO has demonstrated the capability to transmit covert UWB data at a rate of 1 Mb/s for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle applications. Under UWB radar programs ANRO has developed certain novel components including a high power transmitter, CFAR receiver, and a high-gain, low-noise amplifier. These modules will be utilized in a combined theoretical and experimental program to prove WCAR feasibility. ANRO will perform an analysis of the performance and cost of a WCAR system. A brassboard model demonstrating the feasibility of a free space data link is proposed under Phase I. Under Phase II, ANRO will deliver hardware for flight testing and evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In the fabrication of many electronic and opto-electronic products, such as multichip modules (MCMs), flat-panel displays (FPDs) and printed circuit boards (PCBs), it is necessary to fabricate millions of microscopic structures on a single large substrate.  Large format manufacturing equiptment, therefore,plays a critical role in determining the overall cost of these productis.  Over the last two decades, although the device density of ICs has doubled every 18-24 months, packaging technologies fro MCMs and PCBs have not kept pace with the progress in ICs.  As a result, the overall rate of implementation of next generation microelectronic modules in computing, communications, automotive, and defense markets has been slow.  In this proposal, we present a program to identify the bottlenecks impeding the progress in acceptance of next generation manufacturing equipment for MCMs due to both technology considerations and market forces.  We expect that a well orchestrated, joint government-industry effort can lead to an order of magnitude reduction in manufacturing costs, development of a domestic supplier infrastructure, and acceleration of acceptance of new technologies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         APA Optics will develop a monolithic UV seeker for use in flame sensing and passive or tactical threat warning systems. The key to the technical approach is the deposition of high optical/electrical quality Al(x)Ga(1-x)N over GaAs substrates and using it to fabricate back to back Schottky barrier detectors. Al(x)Ga(1-x)N is a compound III/V semiconductor system with a bandgap tunable from 220 to 365 nanometers (x=1 to x=0). Thus selecting x=0.4 we expect our UV sensors to detect only the UV emission from the flame (or plume) and not respond to the IR signal. This makes the sensor immune to false signals from the hot furnace background or the missile body. We also plan to use the GaAs substrate to monolithically integrate the preamplifier with the UV sensor. Our sensor approach is unique because we can also use the substrate to integrate an IR sensor on the same chip. This opens up interesting possibilities of target and flame type discrimination.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose a six month Phase I program to demonstrate the feasibility of growing A1N single crystals to serve as substrates for subsequent A1xGa1xN epitaxy. Our approach is to use a low pressure, high temperature (>>2000oC) furnace with a temperature gradient between the A1N charge and the deposition (seed) regions. Our approach is based on several innovations. These include the use of single precursor synthesized A1N powders that we feel will avoid carbon and oxygen contamination. Our reactor design is unique and has the flexibility of moving the charge or the seed to the high or the low temperature zones. This flexibility is based on one of our proprietary furnace designs. The crystallization approach we propose is a modified Bridgeman technique. The seeding initiates on the tip of a conical zone. in our future Phase II program, with the availability of flat single crystal substrates this design will be modified. Dr. Glen Slack currently at G.E. research and development Center will serve as a consultant on the project. He has the distinction of producing the only known bulk A1N single crystal using A1N powder. We feel that his association coupled with our unique A1N powder chemistry and the furnace design will enable us in demonstrating the feasibility of our approach in the Phase I program. Anticipated Benefits: High quality short wavelength lasers and UV detectors will result from a homoepitaxial scheme of A1N and A1GaN deposition on A1N substrates. These devices will find use in imaging, graphics, and multicolor video displays. They will also be useful for optical recording and storage, flame detection for boiler systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Reconnaissance and surveillance missions, using small robust spacecraft, may require that sensors be rapidly positioned to suit the specific mission requirements. These maneuvers are most effectively conducted using a CMG with an output torque of 2-100 ft.-lbs.; however, the smallest CMG currently available has an output torque that is 225 ft.-lbs. and has a weight of 112 lbs. In order to meet the needs of small robust spacecraft missions, Phase I of this project, carried out by AMT with support from Honeywell Space Systems Operations (HSSO), will attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of producing new CMGs with output torques ranging from 2-100 ft.-lbs. having a weight of less than 40 lbs. It is expected that the reliability will be typical of HSSO CMG products which is higher than .9995 after eight years of operation in space. Lightweight CMG requirements for small robust spacecraft will be established. A preliminary design of a CMG will be generated using advanced composites. A model of the smallsat CMG will be fabricated to demonstrate the overall size and componentry needed. Smallsat CMG performance and reliabililty analysis will be conducted to demonstrate that mission requirements can be met at low weight and high reliability. A Phase II plan to complete development of a prototype CMG will be developed, including a preliminary market assessment and business strategy development task.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The long range objective is to develop a radio frequency (RF) antenna array for optimized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the human breast. Recent MRI technique development has made possible sensitive detection of breast cancer and other abnormalities, but the major manufacturers of MRI systems have not provided high performance RF coils; the coils would help make these techniques practical for imaging the breast. We seek to develop a rf coil array. The rf coil array will provide at least a 40% improvement in signal to noise over available technology. The coils will also provide the potential for simultaneous acquisition from both breasts in the time usually required for single coil imaging. These goals will be accomplished by the application of a generalized theory of quadrature reception which is unique and proprietary technology. RF coil geometries provide the proper orientation to the spin system with elements arranged on a hemispheric form to be non-interacting and noise independent. The result would be an optimal coil array, and it would make possible shorter imaging times and/or higher resolution images on the 2,000 plus MRI systems for which the array could be readily adapted.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Balloon Electronics Control System (BECS) currently used by the Phillips Laboratory is based on custom electronics. Although the BECS performs the necessary balloon control functions reliably, it is not easily reconfigured when system requirements change. These modifications can affect both the cost and schedule of an experiment. In addition, it offers only limited support for onboard experiments. ATA envisions a more effective solution based on recent advances in electronics, coupled with a modular software approach. We, in collaboration with the Physical Science Laboratory (PSL), propose to create a programmable and scalable Acquisition, Control, and Telemetry System (ACTS) by designing and implementing a modular hardware/software architecture that uses the VME bus standard. Consequently, the ACTS will take advantage of commercially available electronics, and provide such features as multiple telemetry streams, automatic software configuation, and experiment processing support. ATA has been at the forefront of many successful system integration tasks performed for the Air Force over the past 18 years. In addition, PSL has been involved with high altitude balloon experiments and telemetry systems for many years. Together, our understanding of system integration and balloon systems will ensure that the ACTS meets the needs of current and future balloon projects.",

(ARNAV) proposes the development of a general aviation (GA) Electronic Pilot Reporting (EPiREP) system that provides real time transmittal of key atmospheric data: temperature, dewpoint, relative humidity, along with altitude, GPS- derived position, and type of the reporting airplane. EPiREP innovatively integrates new, low-cost digital data link packet modem transmission technology, with new low-cost solid state sensors and the global coverage of GPS. The integration of these technologies with ARNAV's low-cost multi-functional display implemented with a color Flat Panel display would lead to a software integrated modular EPiREP affordable for most GA aircraft. The EPiREP system proposed would compliment real time GA cockpit weather systems that are currently under development for displaying National Weather System (NWS) data. EPiREP will provide direct communications between aircraft and an automated ground weather systems for compilation and rebroadcast via satellite link into the NWS. Data compression and frequency conflict resolution software techniques will be used to ensure efficient frequency usage and avoid frequency saturation, and allow more than 150 aircraft to use EPiREP in a 75 mile radius airspace area.",

AS IT SO HAPPENS, THERE IS VIRGIN TERRITORY YET TO BE EXPLORED IN COMMUNICATION NETWORKS, \"SPACE, THE FINAL FRONTIER\", AND IT IS JUST WAITING TO BE TAPPED. BY OPENING UP A WHOLE NEW DIMENSION, SPACE, THAT CAN BE PACKED WITH SIGNALS, SINGLE-USER CHANNELS, FREQUENCY SLOTS IN A LOCALIZED CELL FOR EXAMPLE, CAN BE CONVERTED INTO MULTI-USERCHANNELS. THE GOAL IS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WHILE STILL MAINTAINING THE QUALITY OF LINKS AS MEASURED BY OUTPUT SINR,OR BER, WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE. THE BASIC IDEA BEHIND THEPROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO ESTABLISH MULTIPLE SPATIAL CHANNELS AT THE SAME \"FREQUENCY\", I.E., SPATIAL-DIVISION MULTIPLE-ACCESS (SDMA). CLEARLY IF THIS CAN BE SUCCESSFULLYACCOMPLISHED, THE INCREASE IN CAPACITY IS SIGNIFICANT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT IS TO ASCERTAIN THE APPLICABILITY OF ESPRIT, A TECHNIQUE FOR REAL-TIME SIGNAL PARAMETER ESTIMATION, AND RELATED CONCEPTS TO THE WIRELESS INFORMATION NETWORK ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING BOTH MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS, DIGITAL OR ANALOG, AND PERSONAL COMMUNICATION NETWORKS. IN PHASE I, RESEARCH INTO AND DEVELOPMENT OF ACCURATE SOFTWARE MODELS OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC ENVIRONMENT WILL BE CONDUCTED.

These novel materials will be optimized to meet the specific requirements of effective FSII agents. Results on toxicity will provide an understanding of their environmental fate relative to ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME) and diethylene glycol monoetheyl ether (DiEGME). We will use computer aided computational modeling to design a low cost synthetic analog.

This type of waste and (similar streams from other industries) make significant contributions to landfills.  The solution proposed by ASTER, Inc., proven feasible during the Phase I of this work, is to recycle the paint sludge into ingredients for automotive sealants.  This new approach results in waste generated in the car manufacturing process going back into the production of cars.  ASTER's method is to utilize waste from paint sludge and to compound these materials into a sealant that has been demonstrated to meet current auto makers specifications for printable sealants.  ASTER has already developed recycling technology and a sealant formulation prototype containing 50% of recycled paint waste solids.  The development proposed for Phase II will bring the recycling technology into initial commercial application for both paint waste and sealant industries, and establish the basis for full commercial expansion through the development of similar industrial waste streams.",

The unique design incorporates light trapping, adhesiveless cover slide bonding, and eliminates grid shading. This innovation will increase efficiency and specific power due to the higer open circuit voltage and short circuit current obtainable from a properly designed thin device. The specific power for this novel solar cell is projected to be 3549 W/kg for an AMO efficiency of 24.5%. Thermal stability and tolerance to UV degradation are inherent to the thin device structure and electrostatically bonded 3-mil cover slide. Successful development of this technology will result in a revolutionary improvement in survivability performance, and manufacturability of lightweight GaAs solar cell products for future Earth-orbiting science and space exploration missions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         AstroPower proposes to develop gallium phosphide (GaP) ultraviolet (UV) sensors for engine combustion control. The UV spectra from the free radial combustion components correlates with combustion effectivity in terms of predetonation, and provides a real time basis for central control of excess air ratio, internal combustion temperatures, and other fuel injector parameters. A system for the engine and powertrain control using this sensing method is expected to provide a remarkable improvement in engine performance characteristics. These GaP UV combustion sensors have the advantages of low cost, high sensitivity to ultraviolet light, insensitivity to visible light, and excellent tolerance to high temperatures commonly encountered in internal combustion engine compartments. Detector diodes fabricated using liquid-phase epitaxy show excellent dark current and visible-blind performance; high bandgap GaP material leads to enhanced high-temperature operation up to 500-600 degrees C. The high material quality of GaP and the low-cost of device fabrication lead to significant economic advantages over other high bandgap candidates, such as silicon carbide. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - The visible-blind gallium phosphide UV sensor with excellent high-temperature reliability would have numerous applications in astronomy, high-energy physics, medicine, chemical processing, and other optical analytcal measurement methods. Integration can lead to UV-sensitive CCD detector arrays, with tremendous potential for area-surveillance and safety monitoring. This technology, when fully developed, has large benefits where selectivity, reliability, speed, low-cost, and noise-immunity are required.",

This novel gimbal consists of two rotating joints oriented at an angle of 47.5 degrees from each other. By rotating these two joints through 360 degrees, the gimbal can point the device being steered at any angle from straight up to 5 degrees below the horizon. This gimbal utilizes large diameter bearings in conjunction with large cross section support structures to form an exceptionally stiff and compact unit. The gimbal will be directly driven by hollow core brushless DC motors with integral high resolution encoders. This design incorporates no gear reduction and consequently has zero backlash. The hollow motors and encoders are positioned around the device being steered in order to reduce the size of the overall package. Testing of the prototype gimbal will be performed in order to measure its frequency response, maximum slew rate, and repeatability.",

If realized, such increase may have profound effects on the vehicle weight and maximum airbreathing Mach number. To date, these improved results have only been obtained for vehicles at a specified design point, and no off design analysis has been performed. The work suggested in this proposal takes the first steps toward assessing the feasibility of creating an off-design performance tool that is appropriate for conceptual design applications. As such, this tool should be capable of producing reasonable accuracy at a relatively high rate of computional speed. In addition, the suggested work also examines the feasibility of implementing the required variable geometry into the types of vehicle configurations that are created by the existing design code. Ideals and concepts for handling varible geometry considerations of a wide range of configurations will be proposed.",

This proposal addresses three research areas to be developed in this discipline. (1) Waveforms constructed of wavelets themselves demonstrate fractal, or multi-scale, properties that can make them useful for data modulation, scale-division multiple access (SDMA) and spread spectrum. Fractal modulation techniques leading to all of these constructs will be developed. (2) A class of waveforms -- based on coefficient matrices for othogonal wavelets of compact support -- already shown to be useful for covert, or low prbability of detection and intercept transmission, will be adapted to yield MA waveform sets having both covert properties and potentially higher capacity per unit bandwidth than conventional techniques. (3) The theory of Weyl-Heinsenberg frames will be applied to the construction of real-number error-correcting codes suitable for use of \"DSP\" channels where burst or dropout errors may predominate. Anticipate Benefits: The project has commercial application to progressive transmission of imagery, noninterfering multiple access/multiplexing for users at scaled data rates, multimedia communications, digital radio, satellite direct broadcast, cable TV, municipal communications and covert networks. Military and other agency users may benefit from the new technologies inherent in wavelet-based communications.",

It is aimed at developing and assessing the feasibility of two innovative and fundamentally different approaches to track-before-detect (TBD) processing for passive airborne IRTW and IRST sensors. TBD processing techniques are required for airborne surveillance and threat warning applications in order to effectively counter the very low contrast IR signature of modern threats. Current TBD approaches can provide good signal gain but are computationally very costly and impractical for real-time implementation in compact, low power airborne hardware. The two proposed techniques each offer potential for major performance gains relative to existing methods. However, since they are based on entirely different signal processing approaches, there exists the possibility for potentially combining the best features of both to achieve performance in excess of that afforded by either alone. In addition both approaches offer good potential for smaller, lower power hardware implemenatations than competing methods. In Phase II we will synthesize an algorithm that incorporates selected elements of both approaches in order to maximize detection performance, reduce false tracks, and minimize processor size, weight and power requirements for airborne applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposed effort has the ultimate objective of developing an integrated antenna element design tool -- where structural, thermal and electromagnetic (EM) analyses are applied to a common geometrical model of the antenna. Our basic approach is to utilize a tetrahedral finite-element representation of the antenna as a commn model for the analyses. A user would begin with a canonical or baseline representation of the antenna, composed of solids and surfaces within a CAD tool environment. The user then applies structural and/or thermal boundary conditions, meshes appropriately and analyzes for structural deformations and/or thermal gradients. The resulting model (no longer the baseline antenna) would then be re-meshed with tetrahedral elements with appropriate electromagnetic dielectric properties (temperature sensitive) and boundary conditions applied. A finite-element/boundary integral electromagnetic analysis then computes the impact on gain and VSWR due to the mechanical and thermal stresses placed on the antenna. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - The results of this program will be a demonstrated architecture and design methodology for a precision antenna CAD tool.",

Stable isotopes is utilizedas DNA labels to demonstrate the basic advantages of such labels and to show the multiplexingfeasibility. We have demonstrated that stable isotopes function as both DNA and oligonucleotide labelsand that resonance ionization spectroscopy can offer a very fast method for the detection ofsurface-bound DNA with a high degree of sensitivity, selectivity, spatial resolution, and analysis speed.In Phase I, we evaluate two potentially viable detection techniques for rapid genome diagnosis usinggenosensor matrices: sputter-initiated resonance ionization spectroscopy (SIRIS) and laser atomizationRIS (LARIS). Measurements are made on quartz surfaces, onto which oligonucleotide sequences havebeen attached, to identify positively hybridized and unhybridized sites and to determine the sensitivity,efficiency, background, spatial resolution, and speed - and the interrelationships and trade-offs amongthem.",

Ourinstrumentation development efforts have-proceeded quite well in the area of hardware and softwareto support any combination of dual excitation and or dual emission fluorescent ratio imaging. We willapply our unique capabilities to simultaneous ration imaging of calcium ion and cyclic AMP in single livingcells. For calcium we will use the fluorescent dual wavelength excitation-single wavelength emissiondye fura-2, and for cyclic AMP the single wavelength excitation-dual wavelength emission fluorescenceenergy transfer dye \"FICRhR\". We own the exclusive world-wide rights to this technology for smallmolecules developed at UC San Diego. In this phase I application we will first develop the reagent forcyclic AMP imaging in production quantities, establish methods of stabilization for its distribution anddetermine the proper hardware, software and calibration procedures to accurately utilize it for thedynamic measurement of cyclic AMP in cells. We will then develop techniques for the simultaneousmeasurement of cyclic AMP and calcium in single living cells using the fluorescent probes, \"FICRhR\" andfura-2. Success at simultaneous measurement of these two major cell second messengers will beimportant in providing the tools to elucidate a myriad of cell functions which are interregulated by cyclicAMP and calcium. Furthermore, success in this project will confirm the applicability of this generalapproach to the dynamic analysis of other substances of intracellular regulatory importance, potentiallyimplicated in a wide variety of diseases. Cancer, heart and certain neurological disease are the mostprominent pathological states in which more detailed knowledge of the dynamics of cyclic AMP andcalcium could help in an understanding of the basic cell biological changes associated with thesediseases.",

According to this method a deaf speechreader places his hand on a talker's shoulder with his fingers lightly against the neck; thus, the talker will obtain clues relating to voicing and dynamic speech intensity. The method was invented by a postlingually deaf Swedish male and has been studied since 1986 by several investigators including one of the applicants for this grant (Plant and Spens 1986). The original user's performance is outstanding, and the method has found to be effective on 24 postlingually deaf subjects even without training (Ohngren 1992). The Tactilator , an experimental device, has been built (Ohngren 1992). This device allows an individual to obtain similar information without coming into direct physical contact with the talker; the direct hand-neck contact is replaced with a contact microphone, an appropriate amplifying system and a bone receiver which is hand-held by the deaf speechreader. The purpose is to refine this experimental design; we will replace the contact microphone with a more convenient noise canceling microphone plus suitable processing circuits. We will also study the technique's utility, both as an inexpensive aid-to speechreading and as an adjunct to other tactual and implant methods. We will develop an inexpensive prototype based on an existing product, to design and implement effective evaluation methods, and to begin studies of performance using several variations of the Tactiling method.",

Combined with the ability of simultaneous polarization measurement, and the advantage of small size and weight, the AOTF is well-suited to remote sensing applications. Current AOTF technology has major performance deficiencies that limit its potential for infrared spectral regions. It is the objective of this program to overcome these deficiencies and significantly advance the AOTF technology for practical deployment in infrared imaging systems. A risk reduction effort is proposed in Phase I. The proposed task includes: (a) Design, build and test a resonant infrared TeO2 AOTF to demonstrate low drive power. (b) Operate and evaluate TeO2 AOTF at cryogenic temperatures. (c) Investigate material issues, design concepts and fabrication techniques for wide range infrared AOTFs beyond 5 micrometers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Today many robots are being applied in areas where accurate positioning and orientation of the robot end-effector is required. A practical approach to achieve accurate positioning of the robot end-effector is through the use of an external measuring system. In 1986, a 3-D and 6-D laser tracking interferometer systems (LTIS) were commercialized and have been used worldwide for robotic applications. However, LTIS has severe limitations such as being too expensive, lacking robustness for some industrial applications and lacking capability for measuring orientations dynamically. This proposal presents a Phase I work plan to develop an innovative, low-cost, robust, next generation laser tracking system (LTS) of robot position and orientation measurement. An innovative absolute laser ranging system based on a technique referred to as \"repetitive time-of-flight\" measurement will be developed. The system measures the elapsed time for a light pulse to repeatedly travel between an emitter and receiver, and converts the time to precise distance measurement. To measure angles (pitch, yaw and roll) of the robot in rel-time, an advanced optical sensor will be also developed in this program. Successful development of this next generation LTS will have significant impact in industry. In addition, it creates many opportunities for precision engineering and robotic research.",

Participants in the simulated battle sit inside of physical mock ups of vehicles and engage both real and simualted opponents. The current DIS environments do not address a key tactical element: the infantry. The \"cab simulator\" approach to DIS does not allow for extension to involvement of dismounted infantry into simulated battles. The proposed effort will result in the development of a hybrid virtual reality interface combining total immersion with unencumbered body tracking to allow dismounted infantry to engage directly in a simulated exercise.

Wavepackets and the best-basis algorithm offer the further advantage of adaptability; bases adapt to the signal to provide optimum signal representation. We propose to develop techniques for separting low altitude, low observable targets from clutter on the basis of scale differences. This approach provides subclutter visibility even when the target doppler exists in the clutter region. Therefore, when Fourier methods cannot distinguish target from clutter by frequency, wavepacket methods should separate target from clutter by scale. We will investigate the benefit gained by using the translation invariant wavelet transform (TIWT), developed at Aware, Inc., in the best-basis wavepacket algorithm. the TIWT provides better signal representations than those resulting from the standard wavelet transform. We will characterize clutter probability density functions (pdfs) and parameters through the best-basis wavepacket representation. We intend to develop wavepacket detectors based on likelihood ratio approaches. We will develop a wavepacket based CFAR detector and compare performance to Fourier based approaches. We will develop wavepacket based waveforms to separate from clutter by scale.",

This research is based on the working hypothesis that fluorescent microspheres can be spatially located by fluorescence imaging of organ serial sections. The project will develop instrumentation and procedures to evaluate regional flow in an entire organ. During Phase I, a computer-controlled imaging system will be assembled and images of fluorescent microspheres embedded in perfused rat hearts will be taken. Data analysis procedures will be developed to determine microregional flow characteristics. Phase I studies will demonstrate the feasibility of the working hypothesis and provide design parameters for imaging systems to be constructed during Phase II for use with larger hearts. This project will provide researchers with the instrumentation to rapidly and automatically evaluate microregional flow in tissue using the same procedures involved in radioactive microsphere flow determinations.",

In hypothermically-stored livers, areas of dysfunctional oxidative metabolism can be detected noninvasively using spectrophotometric methods. Fluorescence detection of NADH and visible light reflectance detection of cytochrome redox changes will be used to examine hypothermic perfused and cold-stored rat livers under normoxic, ischemic and uncoupled conditions. The Phase l studies will demonstrate the feasibility of the working hypothesis. Equipment will be assembled to image hepatic NADH fluorescence and measure cytochrome reflectance spectra from both hypothermic perfused and cold-stored rat livers. Correlation of optical changes with hepatic function and dysfunction will be made. The methods developed will be evaluated for their sensitivity for distinguishing areas of impaired mitochondrial metabolism on a background of normal tissue. Upon successful demonstration of the working hypothesis, Phase II will adapt these concepts to development of imaging methods and to testing in a clinical environment at the liver transplant center at Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, Washington.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The burgeoning growth of image and video databases demands fast and effecitve methods for representing and searching image collections. Most current approaches depend upon labeling images with text keywords. Manual labeling is labor-intensive and difficult, because one must predict which parts of an image will be of future interest, as well as what query terms will be used for the retrieval. This research seeks to develop a fully automatic method for representing images that allows query by images, subimages, or terms. The Context Vector appraoch, previously developed for document retrieval in ARPA's Tipster Text Processing Initiative, will be generalized to Image Context Vectors (ICV's) that can handle the special requirements associated with image retrieval. For example, ICV's are designed to be robust with respect to changes in size, position, and orientation of objects within an image, as well as partial occlusions of objects. Phase I will provide a proof-of-concept for the ICV approach as applied to a database of 200-500 images. Phase II will demonstrate effective performance on video images and ona large image database, will experiment with advanced representation techniques, and will explore neural network learning algorithms for adaptive improvement of initial queries. Anticipated Benefits: A successful project will allow automatic indexing and flexible searching of image databases and video libraries; queries can be images, snippets (subimages), or terms. Image Context Vectors may lead to fundamental advanceds in Image Understanding by catalyzing new approaches to image representation.",

The advantage of the non-equilibrium plasma chemical process for the control of NOx, VOCs, and air toxics is that it can operate at ambient temperatures, enabling its application after existing gas cleanup equipment such as electrostatic precipitators, scrubbers or bag houses or in processes where the VOCs or air toxics are from plant or building exhausts. Such a process is also suitable for control of odors. It is felt that non-equilibrium plasma chemical processes are a new, innovative, and cost-effective approach to prevent and control NOx emissions from stationary and mobile sources. Due to the limited effort of the Phase I study and the many varied possibilities of the application of the non-equilibrium plasma chemical process to NOx, VOCs, and air toxics, the Phase I study will concentrate on (1) reduction of NO to nitrogen; (2) destruction of various industrial and commercial solvent vapors, such as styrene, naphtha, methyl ethyl ketone, toluene, benzene, perchloroethylene, trichloroethane and methanol; (3) destruction of nitroaromatic vapors, such as nitrobenzene and nitromethane; and (4) destruction of fuel vapors, such as gasoline and kerosene.",

It will be small, robust, battery-operated, sensitive enough to detect VOCs at a fraction of the OSHA permissible exposure level and selective enough to identify toxic chemicals in a realistic environment. In this phase, we will design and build chemical identification chips incorporating FPW sensors and on-chip preconcentrators.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Berkeley Optics Corp. conceived a novel idea that could reduce the cost of optical fiber connectors and couplers dramatically. In the invention, the core of the fiber is gradually enlarged into a cone-shape (called \"core-extension\") . The core-extension is made by immersing the output end of a fiber in a UV-curable polymer, and then coupling UV light into the input end of the fiber. The UV light divergently radiates from the output end, exposing and solidifying, or increasing the refractive index of, the polymer. Thus a light-guiding core- extension is formed at the end of the core, enlarging the core size from less than 0.1 mm to as large as a few millimeters, making the fiber-to-fiber connection much easier. Since the core-extension is self-aligned, self-attached, the cost of the fabrication could be very low. The core-extension was demonstrated in our laboratory. The US Patent Office decided to allow patent after only six months from the application, surprising us greatly, presumably to encourage us to commercialize the concept fast. This proposal is for making a rugged and very low-cost connector. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Fiber optics has reached a stalemate after a decade of the brisk exploitation of the point-to-point market. As it reaches offices and homes, much larger numbers of interconnection are required while number of users sharing per-interface cost is reduced. Until the costs of connectors and couplers can match those of the coaxial cables, this stalemate will not break. Leg aa, kelev On\"@ t,could break this stalemate.",

We will focus on development of technology required tofabricate these microreactors, and on in vitro studies of islet viability and function. These sphericalmicroreactors will consist of a core which contains the islets, surrounded by a permselective shell. Thispermselective coating permits crossover of low molecular weight substances, including nutrients,electrolytes, oxygen and bioactive secretory products such as insulin, but not of immunocytes and othertransplant rejection effector mechanisms. These microreactors are of sufficiently small diameter thatthey can be injected subcutaneously, intraperitoneally or in other sites simply by using a hypodermicsyringe and needle. This approach does not require lifelong regimen of immunosuppressive drugs withserious side effects. In addition, it does not require costly and complicated surgery, and offers a solutionto the presently insurmountable problem of procuring sufficient numbers of human pancreatic organs bypermitting xenografting of islets from animal sources.",

The detector system will be designed to operate with a pencil-beam sca m ing x-ray source, and will detect the Compton interacted radiation that is scattered back toward the X-ray source. It will image horizontal views of thin layers of the underground structure. The detector we propose to use is cadmium zinc telluride (CdO-gZnO.2Te) ' which is a solid state detector. It is insensitive to vibrations and temperature change, consumes low power, is densely stacked, and has a response time better than 1 Ksec. The detector system will be designed to image layers of the ground with a voxel resolution of 2 cm cubes. The source-detector system will be insensitive to height variations, and will be designed to optimize backscatter radiation from the surface to 6 inches deep in the ground. This system could be successfully implemented with dual energy imaging if it determined necessary or desirable during Phase I. In Phase I we will evaluate experimentally a bench setup and image thin layers of soil. We will report the findings and present our reco m mendations for the development of a full system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In order to grow plants for food on the Space Station, it is very important to cultivate and maintain appropriate microbial eco systems. These ecosystems are essential to fostering proper root development and permitting rapid and healthy growth of plants. Until very recently, there was no simple method or instrument that would permit the monitoring of microbial ecosystems. However in 1989, Biolog, Inc. introduced a revolutionary test kit technology that allows one to monitor micro-scale samples of microbial populations simultaneously in 95 different metabolic tests. This technology was developed originally for pure cultures of microorganisms to yield species level identifications. Then in 1991, Jay Garland and Aaron Mills showed that mixed microbial populations from a variety of soil and water ecosystems also gave unique and characteristic metabolic fingerprints when monitored continuously in Biolog MicroPlates. Recently, their findings have been confirmed at several other universities. In this SBIR submission, we propose to develop a very small instrument that incorporates all of the necessary components (micro test cards, continuous carousel with vision system, and software for analysis and recognition of microbial ecosystems). The instrument will monitor ecosystems of the Space Station, alert the astronauts to undesirable changes, and help determine remedial actions.",

Present day limitations in the holographic recording media used to store multiple holograms precludes the use of this technique in real-time applications. BCC proposes to use highly sensitive, chemically enhanced bacteriorhodopsin (bR) films as a reusable real-time optical material in a pulsed double exposure interferometer. Specifically, we will perform numerical simualtions to determine the necessary film and interferometer system parameters. These results, in conjunction with BCC's established bacteriorhodopsin film technology, will enable us to fabricate a set of bR films for a series of experiments demonstrating real-time pulsed double exposure interferometry. As an optional task we will demonstrate time-averaged interferometry. The work on this project will be performed at the BCC facility at Syracuse University, where all necessary equipment is available.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         There are currently no rapid and reliable in vitro assays that measure the metastatic activity of cells. In this project, we will develop an improved Boyden chamber chemoinvasion assay. The Boyden chamber chemoinvasion assay will utilize Transwell membranes with a defined basement membrane overlayer that will allow in vitro assays for metastatic cells to be conducted with greater speed, reproducability, and sensitivity than existing assays. The chemoinvasion assays evaluate the invasive activity of metastatic cells by quantitating their ability to respond to a chemoattractant by penetrating a layer of reconstituted basement membrane (RBM). Several recent papers which utilize Matrigel as an RBM preparation have shown that this assay can be conducted in 6 hours and clearly discriminates between invasive and non-invasive cells. However, there is considerable assay variability, which is caused by l) variability in the Matrigel overlayer and 2) poor adherence of Matrigel to the polycarbonate membrane (resulting in gaps through which non-metastatic cells can migrate). During Phase I, patented BSI photochemistry will be used to covalently couple type IV collagen and heparin onto the polycarbonate membranes with the expectation of greatly improving the adherence of RBM to the membrane. Also, initial experiments will be conducted to develop a defined RBM preparation to replace Matrigel. Modified polycarbonate membranes overlaid with Matrigel and defined RBM compositions will be evaluated with metastatic and non-metastatic cell lines. Phase II studies will complete the development of a defined RBM preparation.",

Further, the synthetic capabilities of 3'DMT-synthons will be demonstrated by synthesis of normal and inversely linked oligonucleotides. In Phase II, a prototype synthesis instrument accessing all eight amidite (e. g. 5'DMT and 3'DMT amidites) synthons will be developed allowing the automated synthesis of complex inversely linked oligonucleotides. The key design feature of the instrument will be a fluidics path which allows all eight amidites to have equivalently low dead volume. This will result in economical consumption of the more expensive 3'DMT synthons. The instrument will be used to construct novel oligomers allowing investigation of their behavior in probing, priming, and hybridization studies.",

Meta-analysis has had asubstantial impact in many fields but in areas such as mental health, where a body of research oftentakes the form of numerous small and inconclusive studies, its potential impact is especially great. Thegoal of this project is to develop a comprehensive computer program for meta-analysis. The programwill allow the researcher to create a database of studies dynamically linked to analytic procedures. Itwill enable the researcher to compute an average effect (working with a wide selection of effect sizeindices) and to study the impact of moderator variables on the effect size. The program will feature ahost of graphic displays that high-light the substantive (as well as statistical) significance of effects, andwill incorporate features to study publication bias, to display a cumulative meta-analysis, and to performa prospective meta-analysis. It will also allow the researcher to create tables and graphs for inclusionin papers and research proposals.",

Naltrexone is an opiate antagonist which physiologically blocks the narcotic reinforcement mechanism. The microcapsules are targeted to contain more than 50% drug and to deliver approximately 5 mg/per day for one month. We previously developed injectable naltrexone microcapsules which produce opioid antagonism for 30 days or more in monkeys. Because the level of residual methylene chloride in those capsules exceeded the chronic exposure limit of the FDA, in this project a new microfluidized bed process recently developed will be used to greatly reduce the level of methylene chloride. The program will conduct research and development on the preparation of naltrexone microcapsules by the new process, including physical, physicochemical, and in vitro release evaluation. The best microcapsule formulation will be selected for use in Phase II pharmacological and toxicological testing in animals and subsequent human clinical tests.",

It is the purpose of Phase I to demonstrate the feasibility of an injectable, fully biodegradable microcapsule form of estradiol which delivers 60 micrograms of estradiol per day for 90 days and, thereby, provides estrogen replacement without need for frequent oral or transdermaI administration. A new spray core microfluidized bed process is expected to reduce delivery of residual methylene chloride below 100 micrograms/day. Phase I will prepare and characterize microcapsules by drug and polymer content, residual solvent, size distribution, surface morphology, and estradiol crystallinity before studying delivery and degradation in vitro and in rabbits. Phase II program will then prepare clinical samples, test product stability, submit FDA documentation, and conduct a clinical study of safety and pharmacokinetics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The goals of the Phase I research period are to construct and test new amperometric biosensors for the determination of several serum enzymes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), which are frequently associated with alcohol-related organ damage and alcoholism. The sensors are based on the selective detection of products formed by reactions which are catalyzed by these serum enzymes. A novel sensor design permits efficient operation where interference due to dissolved oxygen and spurious current measurements caused by common interference (e. g., ascorbate, urate) are minimized. During Phase II, this technology will be extended to the selective detection of other laboratory markers of alcoholism, such as creatinine, urea, and glutamate dehydrogenase. The optimized sensors could serve an important role in the daily clinical practice of differential diagnostics of alcohol-related organ damage and in follow-up studies of alcoholism treatment programs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this proposal is to develop a lithium ion-selective electrode, primarily for application to the clinical determination of lithium in patients undergoing therapy for manic depression. The lithium electrodes currently available are not sufficiently selective for lithium relative to sodium. The selectivity of these electrodes is determined by the metal affinities of organic molecules that function as ion carriers in polymer membranes. Improved lithium ionophores would enable molecules that function as ion carriers in polymer membranes. Improved lithium ionophores would enable automated analysis of whole blood with minimal handling of blood products by the operator. Similar electrodes for calcium, sodium and potassium are already in use in the clinical analyzer market. The major goal of the proposed project is to improve the lithium selectivity of the most promising family of lithium ionophores by covalent attachment of the ionophores to flexible ethylene oxide and siloxane polymers. This covalent attachment of the ionophores to a polymer backbone should help reduce aggregation and improve the lithium/sodium selectivity by preventing the formation of 2:1 complexes of the ionophore and sodium.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Operation of cooling tower and boiler systems requires frequent monitoring of water chemistry parameters to obtain the necessary information for adjustments to the water treatment program. Failure to perform the necessary adjustments can result in reduced service life and poor energy efficiency resulting from corrosion, scale and fouling. A hybrid absorbance/emission spectrometer is proposed as the key sensor in an on-line system for automatic monitoring and expert system control of cooling tower and boiler systems. The absorbance portion of the system uses a field proven technique for on-line analysis of process solutions using specially calibrated pattern recognition algorithms to interpret the UV-VIS absorbance signatures obtained at frequent intervals using a series of two flow cells of differing path lengths. The emission portion of the system is a patented technique that uses a special flow cell in series with the absorbance cells to energize a sample with an arc discharge and collect the resulting emission pulse using a fiber-optic probe. Absorbance and emission spectra are detected and interpreted using a common spectrograph and embedded computer. They system also includes non-optical sensors such as pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and temperature. The system is capable of simultaneously detecting the major water quality and treatment chemical parameters required to monitor and adjust cooling or boiler water treatment programs.",

MANY OF THE KEY PCB MANUFACTURING STEPS REQUIRE TOOLING WHICH IS UNIQUE FOR EACH PCB DESIGN PRODUCED.  THE QUALITY OF THIS CUSTOM TOOLING HAS A LARGE EFFECT ON THE YIELD AND QUALITY OF THE FINAL PRODUCT.  THE COMPLEX FINE LINE PATTERNS WHICH THE TOOLING MUST ACCURATELY PORTRAY ARE CONTAINED IN A DESIGN DATABASE.  CREATION OF CUSTOM TOOLING FROM THE DESIGN DATABASE IS CURRENTLY A MANUAL PROCESS PERFORMED BY A HUMAN EXPERT.  RESEARCHERS ARE DEVELOPING A TOOLING GENERATOR THAT WOULD PRODUCE PCB CUSTOM TOOLING FROM A DESIGN DATABASE WITHOUT HUMAN INTERVENTION.  SUCH A PRODUCT WOULD ALLOW PCB MANUFACTURERS TO CONVERT A CRITICAL STEP FROM AN UNCONTROLLED MANUAL PROCEDURE INTO A DETERMINISTIC, MEASURABLE PROCESS.  PROVEN TECHNIQUES SUCH AS STATISTICAL PROCESS CONTROL AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT COULD THEN BE APPLIED TO THE CUSTOM TOOLING PORTION OF THE PCB MANUFACTURING PROCESS.",

An injury prevention curriculum will be developed by a group of experts in gerontology, falls, pharmacology, substance abuse, suicide, fire safety, instructional design, and program evaluation. A prototype set of materials will be developed and pilot tested with adult day care, board and care, and nursing facilities staff. Materials will be developed to meet the needs of each audience. Each one will include a course book, instructor's manual, and evaluation instruments. A videotape will be produced to illustrate the need for injury prevention for the elderly suitable for all audiences. The completed system to be developed and field tested in Phase II will include staff training, continuing education, and a network which will serve the purpose of gathering information for continuing evaluation of the program and linking facilities needing training with qualified instructors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The ACRW is a revolutionary new design of a high speed, VTOL aircraft with STOL and CTOL capabilities. The aircraft consists of a circular rotating wing (CRW) which is rotably mounted to the fuselage. The CRW has the shape of a specially designed disk, is free of aerodynamically active flight controls or propulsion members and provides lift for forward flight and gyroscopic stabilization of the aircraft attitude. The fuselage will house the payload and the propulsion and control means. We have researched the ACRW aerodynamic theory, performed design calculations, conducted wind tunnel tests and computer analysis of the flow about the CRW. The wind tunnel tests and the computer analysis show a significant increase in the lift over drag when the wing is rotating as opposed to the fixed wing. Recently we have built two radio-controlled models and successfully investigated some of the ACRW flight characteristics. Bostan Research, Inc. is proposing to demonstrate the ACRW feasibility as a high speed VTOL UAV by testing three radio-controlled flying models. We have already built two new models and a third will be built during Phase I R&D.; The models will have an identical configuration and mode of operation as the proposed ACRW-UAVs. The test results and flying principles will be equally applicable to aircraft of larger or smaller sizes having different configuration and uses. The enhanced aerodynamic characteristics together with the wing gyroscopic stability and artificial stiffening due to centrifugal forces, could make the ACRW the first truly efficient, high speed VTOL aircraft.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         NASA Johnson Space Center is developing an active synthetic soil to grow plants in space as part of their regenerative life support system. The synthetic soil is zeolite based and slowly releases nutrients but unfortunately becomes acidic with time. The proposed research evaluates using natural and synthetic components to buffer soil pH within optimum ranges for plant growth. Objectives are to characterize pH buffering properties of zeolite and apatite (primary components of NASA's active synthetic soil), evaluate pH properties of select buffering amendments, and formulate combinations of amended zeoponic soil. The effort consists of acquisition and characterization of raw materials (zeolite, apatite, and buffering agents); evaluation of pH buffering properties of individual materials using equilibration, titration, and incubation experiments; formulation of various zeoponic treatment combinations using preliminary data and acid-base balance scenarios; and feasibility testing of formulations using additional equilibration, titration, and incubation experiments. Phase II will consist of growing plants with low, medium, and high pH preferences in amended zeoponic soil to refine the innovation to meet NASA needs and allow commercialization. The expected result is development of zeoponic soil with enhanced buffering capacity. NASA will use the innovation in their Regenerative Life Support System.",

The integrity of the DoD procurement process and of DoD technology development depend critically on these standards. One aspect of this dependence is measuring the characteristics of those devices that work well in battle. Those measurements depend directly on the measurement standards. From this knowledge the specifications for new weapons systems are derived and promulgated as procurement specifications. The measurement standards again play a critical role, by determining if required specifications have been met. We propose the development of a cryogenic radiometer based on new technology, high temperature superconductors, with performance intermediate between that of helium temperature radiometers and room temperature instruments. Because of its relative simplicity for cooling, it should be more broadly useful than existing cryogenic radiometers.",

Rule-based and Neural-network calibration schemes will be evaluated. A thrid objective will be to evaluate the effectiveness of various modes of BioLink control. The fourth objective will be to quantify the levels of accuracy and responsiveness achievable with the BioLink. The proposed study will be performed in three parts. Part I will be designed to evaluate subjects' abilities to control the BioLink at a number of selected control frequencies and to evaluate two different modalities of control at the selected control frequencies. Part II of the study will involve developing rule based and neural network based calibration systems which optimize the subjects' BioLink system parameters such as amplifier gain, window centering and thresholding.

In detection of biological agents, a novel Evanescent Guided-Wave Fluorescence (EGWF) method is used in which evanescent optical guided-wave in an optical waveguide is used to excite and collect the fluorescence from the bioagents attached to the waveguide surface. The fluorescence spectral analysis is performing by incorporating an Integrated Optic Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter (IOAOTF) which is monolithicly integrated in the same waveguide.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In this SBIR program, Brimrose proposed to build and develop a miniature solid-state spectrometer capable of determining the identity of individual petrochemical fuels in fluid flow channels and reacting to their presence by automatically implementing safety control processes. Optical spectral analysis will be achieved by utilizing an integrated-optic acousto-optically tunable filter (IOAOTF) implemented on LiNbO3. This device is ideal for application in harsh environments and achieves a narrow passband response (1nm) with fast wavelength tuning (10us) over a wide bandwidth (1.1 to 2.2um) by simply changing its acoustic drive frequency. Furthermore, this component is light weight (<1 gram), small (20x3x1 mm), sensitive, reliable, rugged and requires very little drive poser (<100mW). Due to the inherent fiber compatibility of this device, spectroscopic analysis of fluid flow channels can be made by placing the IOAOTF in a module adjacent to the channel or remotely using an optical fiber probe of several meters length. The co-principal investigator of this program, Dr. Derek Vaughan, was previously working with the LiNbOxIOAOTF development group at British Telecom Laboratories in the UK, and his PhD thesis is concentrated in this field. He is now committed to the further development and application of these devices with Brimrose Corporation.",

Feasibility of this approach will be evaluated by comparingresponses of healthy elderly and elderly with a propensity to fall. In Phase II, interactive virtual-reality'environments' with appropriate quantitative balance assessments will be created. A long-term goal isto fully realize the potential of virtual-reality technology and to develop functionally relevant balancetesting techniques soundly based on psychophysics and clinical electro-physiological methods.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The cancer treatment modality called \"hyperthermia\" has been used to successfully treat thousands of cancer patients around the world. However, hyperthermia has never achieved its true potential because of technical limitations in steering and focusing the heating pattern. The goal is the solution of some of those problems. To do so, we will build and test an elliptical 24 dipole phased array applicator system (called the Sigma Ellipse). This new RF applicator will be innovative in four respects: l) the applicator will have the capability of varying the longitudinal length of the energy focus; 2) the primary heating pattern will have three dimensional dynamic electronic steering capability; 3) the applicator will have the ability to reduce localized superficial heating without significantly altering the central heating focus; and 4) the applicator will have an elliptical shape in order to reduce the amount of bolus water weight supported anteriorly by the patient. These improvements will increase treatment effectiveness and patient tolerance. Included with this project will be a new multi-channel RF generator with independent phase and amplitude capabilities and a modified external B-field sensing probe system for enhanced treatment monitoring. If this project is successful in achieving the expected improvements, the prototype designs will be refined for manufacturing and for clinical trials. Success in this project would provide the potential for a major improvement in the treatment of cancer throughout the world.",

CFD tools are critical to analyze the high Mach number flows typical of these advanced flight vehicles because of limitations on experimental facilities under these extreme flight conditions. However, the validity of CFD codes is limited by their ability to accurately model the complex turbulence processes of high speed flows. Our recent innovations in the development of turbulence transport models based on renormalization group (RNG) methods promise to render many of the most difficult engineering problems of the NASP tractable. Here, we propose to extend and then apply these models to high Mach number wall-bounded compressible flows in which previous modeling efforts have failed. We shall use our HERCULES unstructured grid code as the initial platform for these studies. To expedite access to the new technology for Wright-Patterson personnel, as well as to provide critical feedback to CHI for the commercialization phase, we also propose to implement the new turbulence models in appropriate Air Force software. This work will yield a practical engineering analysis tool for the NASP project.",

However, because of the wide range of scales and physical phenomena, no single code is likely to handle all problems. Here we propose to develop a systematic hierarchy of coupled codes that employ high-order efficient algorithms, state-of-the-art parallel computing software, and advanced turbulence modeling techniques. In Phase I, we shall develop an important building block of this integrated package, namely, a renormalization-group (RNG) large-eddy simulation (LES) code for flow simulations on scales of up to O(100) kilometers in the horizontal direction based on a robust high-order finite-difference algorithm for parallel supercomputers. In Phase II, this new code will be integrated with simulation tools for three-dimensional modeling of meso- and large-scale circulations. In particular, data obtained from simulations using the LES code will provide the necessary input for modeling of vertical mixing in the oceanic boundary layer to be used for global circulation modeling. A key feature of this work is the implementation of new advances in RNG modeling of geophysical and space physical flows that leads to high-order stabilization of negative viscosity phenomena important for global dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Currently there are no automated and efficient portable 3D data acquisition methods to obtain accurate and detailed geometry and texture data for use in computer-based simulators. The goal of the proposed project is to develop innovative methods of data acquisition and processing to produce a quick, accurate, and portable 3D data acquisition system to capture geometry and texture data. The system will use automated video processing, accompanies by new uses of positioning devices, and photogrammetric triangulation. In addition to unique applications of state-of-the-art hardware, such as the use of motion video, new software will be developed to automate the measurement process and obtain the detail and realism requjired for simulation. Recorded data will be usable by existing geometry databases, such as NPSNET, to allow better simuation on existing and new military systems. Specific areas of development will be photographic methods, positioning devices, data processing methods, geometry calculation procedure, and interfacing with databases. Emphasis will be placed on development of a system which will require the least compromise on speed and realism in acquiring, processing, and displaying geometries and textures. CamSys, Inc. has extensive experience in producing and marketing automated measurement equipment for acquiring geometrical data, and has distinct capabilities needed to develop a system for the Naval Training Systems Center. The proposed work examines the feasibility of such a system for Phase II development of a prototype.",

The polymer-modified ceramics or ceramer adhesives are designed to cure without evolving volatile byproducts and with a minimum of bondline shrinkage and void formation. The UV-curing reaction is not inhibited by ambient oxygen or moisture which significantly simplifies field level bonding operations. The ultimate objective of the program is to develop an easily processed adhesive possessing high adhesion to the thermoplastics used in aircraft transparencies, optical clarity, and superior adhesion retention over a wide range of temperatures.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The long term goal is to define the biochemical and immunological characteristics of a vaccine delivery system that will be stable to both environmental and biological effects, thus, allowing for sustained and prolonged release of immunogens, maximal stimulation of the immune system, and protective immunity to pathogens. Liposomes prepared from phospholipids (PL) have been proposed to be a system that will enhance immunity to a wide variety of antigens, but they have not gained wide-use, presumably because of problems of cost and variable biochemical stability. We have data that suggests that a non-phospholipid liposome (NPL) made with a variety of single-tailed biodegradable amphiphiles solve these problems. Our hypothesis is that NPL will overcome the main disadvantage of PL's as carriers of antigens, namely lack of stability both in vitro and in vivo, but will have all of the previously documented advantages of PL in terms of delivery of immunogens and modulation of cells of the immune system. We will investigate in controlled studies in the mouse model, the immune system. We will investigate in controlled studies in the mouse model, the immune response to purified Hepatitis B (HB) antigens encapsulated in NPL. We will pursue 2 specific aims in this Phase I feasibility study to test: 1. comparative studies on different chemical formulations of PL's and NPL's in terms of in vitro stability of NPL's, and 2. the immunogenicity of HBsAg encapsulated in NPL's. Our studies are a prerequisite to Phase II studies that would test this system to determine if it can be used for development of vaccines with extended stability that are effective in inducing protective long-term immunity to pathogens.",

This technology can be used for the production of ferroelectric capacitors. CCVD is low cost, high quality and versatile. It does not require a reaction chamber or furnace, yet the thin films produced are comparable in quality to CVD films, and CCVD technology allows substrates to be passed through a depostion zone for multilayered, production line or large area coatings. We have produced CVD quality films of numerous materials using CCVD in the open atmosphere without a furnace or reaction chamber. Thin films of PZT will be grown using CCVD, and the stoichiometry, morphology, microstructure, and electrical properties of the films will be determined as a function of deposition conditions.",

Our research resultshave clearly implicated free radicals in the etiology of ischemic brain damage. We have demonstratedthat certain spin-trapping compounds (STCs) including phenyl-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN), offer considerableprotection to the brain from an ischemia/ reperfusion-mediated injury if the STCs are administered beforeor even after (1hr) initiating reperfusion of the ischemia-reperfusion lesioned brain. We would like tocapitalize on the commercial protocol of novel STCs for the treatment of stroke. Therefore , we willdetermine if selected novel STCs protect the gerbil brain from ischemia injury and test the STCs in theirability to protect the rat using the middle cerebral artery (permanent as well as reversible) model and inaddition establish a direct relationship between in vivo neuroprotective effects and in vitro antioxidantand radical trapping activity of selected STCs lead compounds.",

Ceracon has demonstrated the feasibility of forming tantalum plates having ultrafine grained microstructure, which exhibits isotropic mechanical behavior at low and high strain rates, and a significantly higher static strength than wrought and other powder metallurgy processed tantalum. However, an understanding of the micromechanics of the grain boundary plasticity needs to be developed, to assure the suitability of this material for warhead applications. A Phase I program is planned, which will investigate the relationship between this unconventional microstructure, processing, and dynamic mechanical properties. This work is expected to lead to the development of intelligent process control to consistently produce desired microstructures in tantalum for warhead applications. Phase II program will address intelligent process control and process scale up to facricate tantalum plate materisl for DOD applications.",

A limitation of current vapor permeation (VP) processes is the upper temperature limit for polymeric VP membranes, about 100-125pC.  In most cases, this results in the need to employ cooling for compressed air feed and may also result in greater membrane areas than would be required for higher temperature operation.  Wider application of the technology would be possible if inexpensive VP modules operable at appreciably higher temperatures were available.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Recent CFDRC studies have demonstrated the advantages of developing back to back radial/mixed flow monorotor technology fully integratable between an ATR tailored solid fuel gas generator (SFGG) and a high heat release combustion chamber. To achieve an ATR Isp over 1500 seconds, the turbine half will utilize an optimized SFGG effluent gas and compactly discharge into the combustor fuel injection assembly. The compressor half will be designed to withstand excessive inlet distortion, and provide a compromise between maximum pressure ratio (to minimize combustor volume) and flow (to maximize engine Isp). Design speed will be selected to accommodate ATR engine turndown ratio requirements associated with vehicle boost, cruise, and loiter requirements. Phase I work proposed includes: a. documentation of related work and promising IM solid propellants; b. ATR component dimension/weight specification in an engine layout; c. preliminary monorotor design and analysis (including CFD simulation); d. monorotor performance definition using ATR engine cycle analysis; e. supporting thermal and mechanical stress analysis (Campbell and Goodman diagrams) for the monorotor assembly; and f. development of a Phase II fabrication, assembly, and test plan.

Stringent precision requirements for devices and the demand for low cost manufacturing techniques emphasize the need for optimizing plasma reactors. Numerical simulation offers a quick and inexpensive alternative/supplement (to hardware experimentation) for designing new and optimized plasma systems. Phase I of this study will involve the development of a simulation tool to model plasma enhanced chemistry and particulate nucleation/transport in plasma reactors. These models will be incorporated into an existing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code capable of solving multi-component fluid flow, heat/mass transfer, and gas/surface chemistry in complex reactor configurations. The coupled model will facilitate the detailed simulation of practical plasma reactors. CFDRC will avail the assistance/guidance of the Plasma/Process Technology group at SEMI/SEMATECH during Phase I. The models will be further refined and validated against benchmark experiments in Phase II. The validated model will be demonstrated on a PECVD reactor to optimize process efficiency and uniformity. During Phase III commercialization, the simulation tools will be made available to members of SEMATECH and the semiconductor industry for further testing and application. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - A validated simulation tool for plasma reactors will facilitate the optimization of plasma systems during the development phase. The use of this tool will reduce design cycle times (and costs) , improve the time-to-market, and allow the industry to adapt quickly to new designs and requirements. All of this will enhance the competitive position of the semiconductor industry.",

The resulting hardware removes the need for engine bleed air presently used for these functions, thereby helping to eliminate a problem in the use of new high- bypass jet engine designs. This development builds on new NASA motor/control/power-processor technology for Electro-Mechanical Actuators (EMA's). That technology is used to design a variable-speed, induction motor driven, heat pump based cooling and heating system, with the variable speed outputs required for environmentally-compatible, HFC-based working fluids. The use of induction motors allows for performance improvements over the traditional DC or brushless DC motor approaches, and also allows the developed technology to be Dual Use, and apply to the large numbers of induction motors in commercial and consumer products.",

This scheme is based on a human-centered approach to obtaining insight into task-specific vision control strategies using eye-tracking hardware. This idea is coupled with computer vision and artificial intelligence frameworks to produce a task-specific programmable system for planning and allocating resources to produce computationally efficient and robust solutions to vision tasks. The results of this project are expected to produce both hardware and software components that can be applied to a wide range of both military and commercial robotic applications. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: Within the military, space, and commercial sectors, active vision technology can be used to support any robotic activity. In the military it could provide the basis for sensor allocation to support both the navigation and RSTA activities for the robotic land vehicles. In space, it could aid in such applications as spacecraft docking and robotic spacecraft repair. In the commercial world, the technology developed will be applicable to robotic construction and earth moving equipment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The need to transmit video information greatly exceeds the current capability to transmit this information for any many military applications. This statement is absolutely true in the teleoperation of semi-autonomous robotic land vehicles where the remote operator needs advanced video compression techniques to support low data rate and supervised driving modes. This proposal advocates the development of a data compression scheme based on an active vision focus of attention model. The overall approach leverages the current understanding that the uniqueness of preattentive parallel features is the primary factor associated with determining visual focus of attention, and is coupled with a current understanding of the processing found within the motion detection channel of the human vision system to produce a technique that is computationally attractive. This overall approach directly leverages Cybernet's previous DARPA work developing an Interface Evaluation System (eye-tracking and operator monitoring). The outcome of this effort is directed at producing software which will function on the Portable OCU Cybernet is building for the DARPA Demo II program, and promises to significantly reduce the data bandwidth required to perform semi-autonomous vehicle navigation on this unit. We believe this project will provide significant technical leveraging to many UGVJPO projects.",

Integration of force feedback into existing synthetic environment applications is very difficult primarily because the systems were not designed for force feedback. We propose to solve the problem of force feedback integration by addressing the very foundation of all synthetic environment systems: the object representation technique. The object representation must be able to flexibly represent complex objects, facilitate calculations of force vectors, provide a simple interface to force feedback devices and allow effective representation of object properties such as weight and texture. We will design the force feedback oject representation scheme by expanding our knowledge in the area, evaluating representations with the objective of force feedback integration and leverage our extensive knowledge of force feedback we have gained through the development of a 6DOF PER-Force force feedback handcontroller and its integration into telerobotics and molecular modeling applications.",

The proposed development of novel chemical microsensors and instrumentation have a unique combination of advantages to satisfy this need.  The small sample size required by the microsensors in these instruments will both prolong their useful lifetime in corrosive environments and greatly simplify any sample-conditioning requirements.  Moreover, they can be mass produced on silicon wafers using standard methods to significantly reduce costs, while achieving high reproducibility and minimizing calibration requirements.  The objective of this Phase II project is to develop a new generation of mercury continuous emissions monitors based on the robust thin-film chemical microsensors developed in Phase I.  The Phase II effort will focus on the development, evaluation and optimization of an EPA-protocol-based sample conditioning system interfaced to an ultrasensitive mercury analyzer to achieve reliable continuous monitoring of mercury from combustion sources.  This Phase II project will provide the basis for the commercialization of a continuous mercury emissions monitor that will be evaluated at several combustion sources prior to commercialization in Phase III.",

Part of the high cost of AZT is due to the high cost of thymidine. The goal is to engineer a bacterial strain to enable it to make and excrete high amounts of thymidine; this project will make it possible to produce thymidine by fermentation at much less cost than is currently available. The approach is to engineer the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway to increase the levels of the enzymes and to eliminate feedback inhibition of the pathway. We propose a method for modifying one of the key enzymes of the pathway, dCTP deaminase (dcd), that is subject to feedback inhibition, to eliminate the inhibition. The cloned dcd will be subjected to in vitro mutagenesis and mutants will be analyzed for their regulatory properties. Phase II will include incorporation of the mutant dCTP deaminase into thymidine production strains in combination with other relevant genes.",

In the wakeof recent research successes, the first generation of commercial APR systems has emerged.However,both research and commercial APR developments so far have been technology-driven, focusing primarilyon specific hardware or database technologies, without sufficient emphasis on user-requirements orinterface research. As a result, existing systems have met resistance from the user community,particularly on issues of user interface and usability.The proposed research addresses these problems,bringing together a team of leading human-computer interface researchers and APR experts to performa user-oriented design for a novel APR interface. This analysis will apply methods of organizational andcognitive analysis developed by the principal investigator in prior research. The full APR interface,which includes multiple views of the APR data, based on different modes and contexts of access, isimplemented in Phase II, using open systems technology such as X-Windows/MOTIF software, to renderit portable and able to be integrated into a wide range of present and future APR systems.",

HOMBAS will be designed primarily for integration into simulations of complete systems, to permit human contributions to total system performance to be appropriately reflected in simulation-based evaluations of any system component. HOMBAS will employ many key design features of HOMME in a new software implementation, but with three major revisions: 1) extended and improved user interface, 2) incorporation of models for time-extensive skilled performance, and 3) capability for linkage with other simulation software. A ke focus of our HOMBAS design is a powerful facility for constructing task descriptions of required human operator functions, and automatically interpreting them, along with an application-specific knowledge base, into applications of human performance micro-models from a HOMBAS resident library. The principal outputs of HOMBAS will be a timeline of human performance events that will be merged with other simulation events generated by the host simulation in which HOMBAS is embedded. HOMBAS will be designed for implementation in the CLIPS 5.0 environment on a 486-class PC.",

Current decision makin aids at the tactical level are almost exclusively manual and failr to adequately integrate all combat power multipliers, such as artillery, intelligence, logistics, etc., into single integrated decision aids that can accommodate real time information. CHI Systems proposes to adapt and integrate the Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (TPB), tactical planning and orders, and tactical situation assessment processes into a single intelligent tool to be known as Automated Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (AIPB). AIPB will be able to fuse available tactical information to develop an initial decision supoprt matrix in support of a tactical plan, and then cyclically update the matrix with information from Army data systems such as the Maneuver Control System and Advanced Field ARtillery Tactical Data System. This tool will provide real-time tactical decision support for Battlefield Commanders and Operations staff thorugh the use of a flexible, cognitively engineered interface and advanced expert system technologies. The final result of Phase I will be the design of an integrated \"living\" decision support system that will assist both tactical planning and execution.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Electronically tunable optical filters are important components of freguency-agile sensor systems. Acousto-optic filters (AOTF) offer the best near-term technology for implementation of frequency-agile imaging optical sensors. These filters however, suffer from several limitations. On important deficiency is the limited off-band rejection attainable with these devices which is typically of the order of 10(-4) far off-band and closer to 10(-1) near off-band due to the presence of side lobes. This limited off-band rejection limits the application of AOTF-based devices to target discrimination problems where a weak signal must be discriminated against a high background. Recently, holographic filters have become available with extraordinarily high off-band rejection of the order of 10(-7). These devices, however, are fixed-bandpass devices, and are not suitable for frequency-agile imaging sensors. The present porposal is to develop an innovative electronically tunable optical filter with off-band rejection comparable to that of a holographic filter.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Fluorescence-lifetime based sensing provides a more robust and reliable detection method than intensity measurements which are notoriously prone to systematic errors. Measurement of fluorescence lifetime is also an important adjunct to quantitative spectrofluorimetric measurements in direct fiber-optic sensing systems. The reason for this is that dynamic quenching effects by other species in the sample may disrupt the correlation between a fluorescence intensity measurement and the concentration of analyte. In these cases, a fluorescence lifetime measurement may provide the additional information required to account for the effect of quenching on the measurement. We propose to develop a 1 0 MHz single-frequency cross-correlation digital phase fluorometer which exploits recent technological developments for inexpensive generation of the light modulation and cross- correlation frequencies. Additionally, we propose to replace the expensive analog electronics in current use for the phase measurement with a digital filter and digital phase detection thereby achieving a dramatic reduction in cost, while improving performance and reliability. The proposed approach will convert the problem of accurate phase measurement from a demanding analog hardware problem to a software solution with off-the-sheff hardware.",

To compete with alternate modes of travel like the interstate highway system and airlines, GA aircraft must provide transportation that is fast, economical, safe, and reliably usable in any weather. The operation of light personal transportation aircraft of the near future will be made economically viable by the application of NASA developed technologies. The NLF airfoil series is an important example of those technologies. With very low drag coefficients at cruise speeds, it makes possible single engine aircraft that provide truly rapid personal transit. Electromagnetic type deicing is another example of a NASA developed technology that will soon be important to the utility of small single engine aircraft. Electromagnetic techniques provide deicing systems that are light weight, relatively low cost, and require relatively low power for actuation. Deicing systems currently available, are either too expensive for small business and personal transportation aircraft, or are not built to maintain natural laminar flow. The development of an NLF compatible, electromagnetic deice system will be a significant step in making GA travel safer and more dependable.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The catastrophic drinking water treatment plant failure in March 1993 in Milwaukee was a direct result of the inability to control coagulant chemical dosage during significant changed in raw water quality.  This event largely dispelled the myth that only small water utilities were vulnerable to such control problems.  The current state of this critical technology, coagulant dose control, is woefully inadequate.  The Milwaukee failure is traceable to the inadequate tools plant operators have available to deal with this daily on-going problem at every plant site.  Optimization with the jar test, a trusted standard feedforward control method, is skill and labor intensive, too slow, and too insensitive for many modern water treatment plants.  Streaming current detectors - the sole automated feedback controller - cannot be calibrated to a known reference and requires skilled technicians to set and maintain control.\r \r A new coagulation control concept was demonstrated in Phase I to be feasible for achieving both feed forward and feed back coagulant control.  This utilizes a technique called colloid charge titration, but with a unique new method of end-point detection.  Clear Corporation Enterprises, Inc.'s Phase II objectives are (1)  design a prototype instrument capable of proof in field test based on applicability proven in Phase I, (2)  implement the innovative new end-point detection and feedforward/feedback technique in a rugged easy to use and affordable design, and (3)  validate system performance at a municipal water treatment facility.  The proposed program is attractive because it could address a seemingly intractable, critical control problem which has plagued the drinking water industry nationwide throughout is history.  This device, if proven effective, could provide operators even in small facilities with the means to prevent catastrophes like Milwaukee's.",

With the increasing pressure for cost containment andthe increasing popularity of laparoscopic gynecological procedures moving to the outpatient clinic andGYN office, a cost-effective uterine manipulator that can be easily used by he laparoscopist is veryattractive. We will develop an inexpensive uterine manipulator that will allow the gynecologiclaparoscopist to freely position the uterus. This would lead to a more cost effective laparoscopic surgerydue to greater ease in uterine manipulation and assuring greater safety because of better visualization.A basic feature of this low-cost device is a pivot point positioned at the cervical opening. In addition,this manipulator will be easy to insert, simple to secure firmly in place, and readily set in a given position.The device will be disposable to prevent cross-contamination and eliminate the need for tedious cleaning.An important feature of the device will be the ability to perform uterine injections of dye using a soft(silicone) balloon which will engage and firmly hold the manipulator in place within the uterine cavity andseal the dye within the cavity.",

A preliminary design has been specified for an airborne instrument. The proposed second phase of that study is intended to develop and test an appropriate long coherence time-pulsed transceiver. The program proposed herein will develop scanning and real-time signal processing components to be used with this transceiver and will carry out a flight demonstration of the integrated system. A capability to make measurements of atmospheric wind profiles off the aircraft track will be incorporated. The overall instrument is to be developed with the particular goal of making highly precise measurement of the ambient wind vector along the track of a research aircraft. This data will be coupled to simultaneous on- board measurements of species density so that estimates of the turbulent fluxes and growth/decay rates of various species in the planetary biosphere can be monitored. Additional application areas include: detection and monitoring of large high altitude wind velocity turbulence that can cause 'unstart' in supersonic aircraft; provide precision airdata autopilot input; and short- range windshear monitoring for commercial airliner wake vortex encounters.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         NASA has recently begun a program to improve terminal area productivity (capacity) that will serve to simultaneously save airline operating costs and improve aviation safety. Reduction of aircraft spacing during instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions requires a thorough understanding of environmental effects on wake vortex transport and decay mechanisms. In the proposed program, existing algorithms for processing coherent lidar data to locate and track aircraft wake vortices and to display the wake structure are to be expanded. A currently available database of wake measurements made at Stapleton International Airport will be analyzed with existing algorithms for wake tracks and wake strengths. Tracks will be correlated with available environmental data and analyzed for wake decay and transport mechanisms. A 2D Kalman hydro-code analysis will be upgraded and applied to these data and the results assessed for capability of the Kalman procedure to identify wake structure. An analysis of the requirements for implementation in 3D with a high PRF system will be developed and incorporated into the existing real-time processor using a limited 3D grid and evaluated for capability to handle an upgrade to a high PRF. Memory and CPU requirements for a 3D implementation of the Kalman analysis will be determined and a design for an upgraded real-time processor will be developed.",

Opportunities for employment, promotion, and education for this population can be negativelyaffected by their inability to communicate effectively in English. Little is known, however, about thespecific phonetic and phonological factors which affect the intelligibility of non-native speech. Thisproject proposes to investigate the effects on intelligibility of the phonetic and phonologicalcharacteristics of two types of foreign-accented English (native Chinese and Spanish speakers). Thisresearch will provide the empirical basis for the development of a computer-based pronunciation trainingsystem which will utilize both speaker-dependent and speaker-independent automatic speech recognitiontechnology. Unlike other efforts to develop computer-based speech trainers, this system will provide,as feedback, a measure of speech quality which has been shown to correlate well with humanjudgements. To establish the validity' of utilizing speech-recognition technology for second-languagepronunciation training the capability of the speech recognizer to perform the relevant acousticdiscriminations will be assessed. The effectiveness of the computer-based speech training aid will thenbe evaluated through pre- and post-training intelligibility testing of non-native speech.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Computer and engine studies demonstrated a 100% increase in diesel engine power with the use of 31% oxygen enriched air (OEA) versus standard 21% oxygen air. Additional benefits from OEA include: (1) improved fuel efficiency, (2) compatible with lower grade (volatility) fuels, (3) reduced CO and hydrocarbon emissions, (4) enhanced lean burn capability, (5) smoother less noisy operation, (6) better and cleaner cold starts, and (7) reduced particulate emissions. The major limitation in using OEA for enhanced (diesel) engine performance is no compact OEA supply system exists today. Our high oxygen permeability perfluoropolymer membrances dramatically improve oxygen flux capability and will supply compact OEA membrane systems to support enhanced (diesel) engine performance. Engineering studies indicate our perflouromembrane system productivity is 30 times better than existing competition and membrane devices smaller than 0.25 cubic feet will supply all OEA (diesel) engine needs at full throttle. Phase I focuses on proof of proudct concept by developing the needed thin film composite membrane structure to demonstrate high flux. Phase II will focus on developing expanded area prototype membrane modules and running both actual engine tests and associated computer modeling studies. Anticipated Benefits: This project introduces compact OEA membranes for improved power, fuel efficiency and pollution control of engines. Although engines are our focus, other applications will follow. These include (1) OEA for health care, (2) OEA for improved burner efficiency, (3) VOC abatement, (4) nitrogen enriching air for inerting operations and (5) industrial oxygen and nitrogen uses.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Compact Software, a leading software company in development of CAD tools for microwave industry has teamed up with Martin Marietta, Electronic and Missile System group, to develop accurate CAD tools for Coplanar Waveguide (CPW) discontinuity structures. The lack of comprehensive design information on discontinuities and other interacting structures, especially in the commercial CAD-tools, has so far precluded CPW transmission lines from being extensively used in MMICs. To this date, there are no commercially available CAD tools which can support both simulation and optimization of circuits containing CPW discontinuities. Therefore, a designer has to design coplanar circuits using a combination of CAD-tools which neither inspires design confidence nor achieves first pass success. During Phase I, we will identify, design, and fabricate a comprehensive set of CPW discontinuities applicable to GaAs monolithic circuits. We will establish feasibility by developing accurate discontinuity models for a selected number of structures over a large range of physical parameters experiments. During the Phase II program, we will complete the modeling and validation tasks for over 200 dicontinuity structures. The validated models will then be used to design and fabricate two coplanar millimeter-wave monolithic amplifiers. The final discontinuity models will be integrated into our commercially available circuit simulators. Anticipated Benefits: Inclusion of the proposed CPW discontinuity models in our commercially available circuit simulators will enhance the accuracy of coplanar based MMIC designs. Since no other CAD vendor offers such models, we anticipate product distribution in excess of 2000 units within the completion of Phase II program.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Compact Software Inc., a leading software company in development of CAD tools for the microwave industry is proposing to develop a much needed bias-dependent noise model for Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors (HBTs). HBTs are viable candidates for future applications in monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) where highly accurate linear and non-linear noise models are critical, especially for first pass design. The noise models in use today are based on approximations which disqualify them for use with HBTs. Therefore a need exists for the development of an accurate physics-based HBT noise model which removes the current limitations. Our proposed model, is based on a full treatment of shot noise theory in semiconductor junctions, eliminating the current approximations. For model validation, we will obtain HBTs from several MIMIC foundries and will use \"on wafer\" noise characterization to obtain accurate noise parameters as function of frequency. During the Phase II program, we will complete the bias-dependent noise models for both shot noise and flicker noise and integrate the proposed models in our commercilly available circuit simulators, Microwave Harmonica and Super-Compact. The CAD enhancements resulting from this effort will be of immediate benefit to the MIMIC community and also to the DoD, MIC, MMIC suppliers and commercial microwave companies.",

The numerical analysis technique discussed in this proposal combines two state-of-the-art proven techniques in a hybrid formulation. The first, is an entire domain Method of Moments (MOM) technique which greatly reduces the number of unknowns required in scattering problems. This Generalized Entire Domain (GED) approach was pioneered and developed by the principal investigator, Mr. Terry L. Krohn. The second is a Quadratic Surface Patch (QSP) physical optics and physical theory of diffraction model, co-authored by Mr. Krohn. This computer code has received national attention from the Electromagnetic Code Consortium (EMCC). Mr. Krohn is a member of the MOM technical working group for the EMCC. Both of the computer models discussed above interface with Computer Aided Design (CAD) geometry packages. The basis for this approach is that internal (non-edge) currents are well represented by optics assumptions. Optics assumptions are angle dependent whereas MOM matrices are not. This proposal details a viable approach to belie this disadvantage and solve problems having many thousands or even millions, of square wavelengths of surface area.",

These new systems are designed to work with the operator to provide him additional degrees of freedom and perceptive capability. The resulting system will perform tasks beyond the capability of either the man or the machine alone. Our hypothesis is that the interface is the critical component of these systems. The interface we propose will integrate voice recognition, image processing, eye tracking and force feedback technologies. The goal is to devise an interface that is as seamless and as intuitive as possible. A number of applications will be possible with such an interface. For example, an astronaut could use micro manipulators as \"additional arms\" when performing repairs in space. He could control these manipulators to work in tandem with his own arms to accomplish tasks that might otherwise require several people. Our initial application of this technology is in endoscopic surgery. With robotic enhancement, the surgeon will be able to control an endoscope and three surgical tools simultaneously.",

Recent advances in fuzzy logic and ANNs have provided new modeling techniques to narrow the gap between the model and real physiology systems. Specifically, hierarchical fuzzy systems and other fuzzy logic modeling techniques will be investigated and applied to improve eye muscle and vestibular modeling accuracy. Temporal and/or asynchronous ANNS will be incorporated for enhancing the vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) neuronal pathway model. Utilizing hierarchical fuzzy logic systems adds benefit to tranditional software moedling because as future physiological properties are discovered the model can be adapted to include these aspects. Further, by utilizing temporal and/or asynchronous properties, the ANN based neuronal pathway model will be closer to real physiological systems. Therefore, the Phase I effort will determine the feasible improvement in the modeling of the vestibular system, eye muscle, and neuronal pathway. In addition, a final model which encompasses the above three will be outlined for prototypes in the Phase II. The purpose is to enable a clinician/scientist to match VOR signal abnormalities to physiological changes without the need for prior \"examples\".",

Conductus, Inc., in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, has begun development of STJ X-ray detectors which use a novel multilayer electrode structure. We have already demonstrated Nb/Al-Al2O3-Al/Nb tunnel junction detectors with about 40 eV resolution for 6 keV X-rays; this is the best resolution ever obtained for any type of STJ detector. Because of their simplicity, bandwidth, resolution and count-rate capability, superconducting tunnel junction spectrometers should be ideally suited for X-ray astronomy applications. In phase I of this project we will optimize the electrode structure for energy resolution and operating temperature. In phase II we will develop large area detector arrays with high quantum efficiency and high spatial resolution.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Because of their low noise and enormous bandwidth, dc Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUID)s are very attractive as amplifiers for many applications. Conventional SQUID amplifiers are often not suitable for these applications, because the readout electronics employ flux modulation which imposes a severe bandwidth limitation and increases their complexity. For applications in space, this significantly increases the cost of preparing flight-qualified electronics. If the SQUID is not properly designed and damped, parasitic resonances are introduced, complicating the operation of the SQUID and leading to excess noise which degrades performance. We propose to develop a low-noise, two-stage SQUID amplifier with very simple electronics and appropriate packaging that is ideally suited for cryogenic detector readout applications in space. The amplifier consists of a single, low-noise SQUID input stage, followed by a coherently modulated, series-connected SQUID array output stage. A proven design optimization procedure is employed to ensure proper treatment of the parasitic resonances. Properly designed, the output noise is dominated by the amplified noise of the input SQUID and is sufficiently high to allow direct connection to a room-temperature preamplifier. Additional electronics are not required, and the high bandwidth and dynamic range are preserved.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In the 1980s, two independent developments in text retrieval attempted to improve Boolean searching. These were statisticaly searching, which allowed users to enter requests in plain English and retrieve documents based upon the statistical occurence of words; and concept based searching, which requires users to define concepts in a knowledge base and perform searches by entering a concept by its name. Both of these methods made some improvements in accuracy, but placed additional burden on the user. Statistical searching has not been readily accepted because it is difficult to explain the results. Concept based searching requires extensive labor to build the underlying \"knowledge base\" of search concepts. ConQuest Software, by using retrieval software, called ConQuest (TM), that includes the best of both statistical and concept based searching, but also eliminated the need for users to build a knowledge base. The objective of this effort is to combine ConQuest with new processing to reach breakthrough levels of precision and recall accuracy by exploiting the power of a large semantic network that includes, but is not limited to the contents of WordNet. The research results will demonstrate that linguistically based text retrieval systems have a higher upside potential than purely statistically based systems. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The proposed system is useful to the Government in many ways: it enhances research programs such as TIPSTER, it provides a capability for intelligence agency work, it provides document management, and in manages information (DTIC). The commercial market for text retrieval is rapidly growing and has applications spanning corporate intelligence, legal, regulatory, marketing, and document management.",

This study seeks to redress this drawback by implementing a novel time-domain decomposition algorithm on a parallel computer. This parallel scheme will achieve orders of magnitude reduction in computation times while making full use of existing sequential algorithms for simulating periodic systems on parallel computers. Perfect load balance will be accomplished and inter-processor communication minimized using the proposed scheme. Though the parallel algorithm is applicable to any time-periodic system this effort will focus upon the rotor-stator interaction problem using an existing highly accurate aeroelastic analysis. By basing the analysis on a validated fluid-structure interaction code, another drawback of existing rotor-stator codes namely the absence of a true aeroelastic capability will be repaired. In Phase I, validation exercises will be conducted on a parallel machine in order to assess the coding effort entailed in adapting an existing serial code to parallel computation and CPU gains over serial methods using the proposed technique. In Phase II. the technique will be extended to full 3D viscous aeroelastic turbomachinery rotor-stator computations on a parallel machine.",

DNA supercoiling is an important facet of biological processes that entail local helical unwinding or denaturation. Recent computer simulations have demonstrated the potential for clarifying the biological role of local structures and ligand binding on DNA super-coiling. The polyelectrolyte character of the DNA has not been included because of computational constraint. The present effort aims to develop a fast O(NlogN) method for the robust treatment of the polyelectrolyte effect in prototypical Monte Carlo and finite element computations. The method will be implemented on advanced parallel- processing platforms using a novel low-overhead communication strategy. The new strategy exploits the multi-level near-field/far-field structure of the fast hierarchical method to eliminate the globality of the electrostatic problem. The resulting computational tools will be designed to take full advantage of the computing power put forth by high-performance parallel-processing supercomputers and will serve to showcase a Grand Challenge application of High Performance Computing in large scale biological systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This research project uses object-oriented technology to enable the creation of production quality commercial software for high performance computing (HPC) hardware. Primary concerns include ease of use, platform flexibility, and high performance. The investigation focuses on a C++ programming environment, called Hi-C++, scalable and portable over a variety of HPC platforms ranging from workstation clusters to massively parallel machines. The Hi-C++ approach makes use of detailed structural and contextual analysis of each program segment, with run-time implementations designed to exploit this special knowledge to gain high performance. The proposed concepts will be proven via commercial applications written in Hi-C++. The compiler/run-time system know-how and infrastructure required are advantages unique to Cooperating Systems Corporation. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The proposed software solution lowers the risk and long-range cost of HPC and makes it truly useful for commercial as well as defense applications. Modeling and simulation in production, manufacturing, engineering, and financial instrument trading will all benefit.",

We will synthesize fluorescent GSH probes for the study of these receptor sites and measure their binding constants in competition with radiolabeled GSH. Fluorescence labeled probes with suitable binding constants will be used to study the distribution of binding sites in the CNS and other peripheral tissues and to examine second messenger (IP3) activation in cultured astrocytes.

These electronic devices are expected to work in tandem with advanced batteries or fuel cells to provide burst power required for acceleration and hill climbing. In order to greatly increase the double layer capacitance of carbonaceous electrode materials supplied to us by a domestic manufacturer of \"supercapacitors\", we propose to substitute the usual organic electrolyte with a highly conductive room temperature molten salt electrolyte. Prototype laboratory capacitors and capacitors fabricated from coin cell hardware will be tested with respect to voltage window, double layer capacitance, rate capability, and cycle life. Technical Benefits: High voltage, high power density \"supercapacitors\" will be used in vehicular propulsion technologies in conjunction with batteries and fuel cells. Advanced \"supercapacitors\" are also required for advanced portable electronic devices such as radios, cellular phones, and notebook computers.",

Situational judgment inventories present respondents with a series of job-relevant situations and ask them to indicate which of several alternative actions would be most effective and which would be least effective in each situation. This inventory will consist of items describing pilot-relevant situations that tap personality dimensions important for effective functioning as a combat pilot, and that are not measured adequately by the AFOQT or the BAT. We also plan to develop a software shell to administer and score the inventory. This shell will be compatible with the BAT/PORTABAT sortware, and will be flexible enough to permit the administration and scoring of almost any multiple-choice test. Phase I efforts will entail deciding upon personality constructs to measure using the inventory, developing four or five situational judgment inventory items tapping each of those constructs, designing demonstration software to administer the items, and establishing plans for the development of a flexible software shell.",

Iduronidase (IDUA) enzyme activity is deficient in themucopolysaccharidosis I class (Hurler, Hurler-Scheie and Scheie syndromes) of lysosomal storagedisorders. Enzyme replacement using exogenous IDUA has been shown to be effective in cell cultureand animal disease models but the limited supply of pure IDUA seriously hampers research needed todevelop this approach into an effective therapy. Transgenic tobacco has the potential to express humanIDUA in large amounts sufficient to produce a cost-effective source of protein for research andtherapeutic needs. Phase I will demonstrate the ability of tobacco plant cells to express the human IDUAgene. Specific objectives are 1) to engineer human IDUA cDNA's into appropriate plant transforma-tion/expression vectors, and 2) to introduce the IDUA gene into tobacco and monitor transgeneexpression and IDUA production. Success in these objectives would support Phase II research aimed atoptimizing production of bioactive human IDUA in transgenic tobacco.

        "abstract": "Abstract         All rocket propellant power derives from the reaction of a fuel and oxidizer. Accordingly, all liquid rockets, and especially all cryogenic liquid rockets, have two complete fuel systems. One set each of containment tanks, pumps, instrumentation, and so on. Solid rockets, on the other hand, have only one fuel system, so to speak. The solid rocket motor contains the fuel and oxidizer in a rubber-like base. The fuel is called a monopropellant, since it is not necessary to mix the two components. It is interesting to speculate on how things could be different if we had access to a cryogenic monopropellant. Perhaps we could combine some of the best features of solid rockets and liquid rockets. For instance, we could have the fuel system simplicity of a solid rocket combined with the ISP and variable thrust of a liquid rocket. Accordingly, we have developed a new cryogenic monopropellant which is made by adding a hydrocarbon fuel such as methane to liquid oxygen. We will show how liquid oxygen may also be combined with a hydrocarbon fuel, such a methane, under controlled pressures and temperatures such that a single phase, totally miscible, liquid cryogenic monopropellant propellant is provided. Under the conditions described, the liquid oxygen/methane propellant is a single phase totally miscible liquid solution.",

CRYOGENIC PUMPS AND FROZEN PELLET INJECTION ARE THE MOST EFFICIENT MEANS OF PUMPING AND REFUELING THE TOKAMAK PLASMA.  SINCE THE BURN RATE OF THE REACTOR IS ONLY A FEW PERCENT, HOWEVER, THE EXHAUST FUEL WILL HAVE LARGE QUANTITIES OF UNREACTED DEUTERIUM AND TRITIUM.  SINCE TRITIUM IS A RADIOACTIVE GAS IT IS IMPORTANT TO LIMIT THE TOTAL TRITIUM INVENTORY OF THE REACTOR TO A MINIMUM.  THIS WILL REQUIRE RAPID RECYCLING OF THE TRITIUM PUMPED FROM THE REACTOR INTO THE PELLET FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM.  THIS PROJECT WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS WITH A CONTINUOUS CRYOGENIC FOREPUMP WHICH WILL RECEIVE THE EXHAUST FROM THE PRIMARY PUMPING SYSTEM AND PRODUCE HIGH QUALITY FROZEN DEUTERIUM/TRITIUM PELLETS SUITABLE FOR DIRECTLY FEEDING A CENTRIFUGE PELLET INJECTOR.  THE CRYOPUMP WILL THUS BE ABLE TO GREATLY REDUCE THE TRITIUM INVENTORY BY RECYCLING THE FUEL BACK INTO THE PLASMA WITHIN A FEW MINUTES FROM THE TIME THE FUEL ENTERS THE PUMP.  IN ADDITION THE PROPOSED PUMP/PELLET FABRICATION APPARATUS CONSISTS OF A SINGLE CRYOPANEL WHICH WILL BOTH PUMP AND PRODUCE PELLETS WITH NO MOVING PARTS, THEREBY GREATLY INCREASING THE RELIABILITY AND REDUCING THE COST OF THE APPARATUS AS COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL PUMPING AND PELLET FUELING SYSTEMS.  IN PHASE I A SMALL PUMP WILL BE CONSTRUCTED WHICH WILL DEMONSTRATE THE CAPABILITY OF PRODUCING DEUTERIUM PELLETS, AND A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF A FULL SCALE REACTOR SYSTEM, TO BE CONSTRUCTED AND TESTED AS A PHASE II EFFORT, WILL BE PRODUCED.",

Crystals of KTA have shown promise in this application, however, improved optical transmission is still required. The synthesis, crystal growth and characterization of the new materials, KiOSbO4 and KTiONbO4 will be examined. Based on previous experimental data, empirical relationships were developed which indicated substitution of Nb and/or Sb for As in KTA type crystals should extend the IR cutoff out past 6 jm and reduce or eliminate the unwanted absorptions at 2-5 m. It is anticipated that the nonlinear properties will not be significantly different than those of KTA and KTP. OPTION TASK: None submitted",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Diamond films grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD) have become an important engineering material. Microwave plasma (MP) CVD ofdiamond is particularly advantageous because it leads to material with the highest quality in terms of impurity content, electronic and optical properties, and carries fewer liabilities of power inefficiency and excess heat removal than other deposition methods. It has, however, proven difficult to scale MPCVD of diamond up to production levels due to the small size of the plasma produced under the constraints of diamond growth. Crystallume has developed and convincingly demonstrated a proprietary scaling technology for microwave plasma diamond deposition. In work to date, this technology has powerfully enahnced the deposition performance of a 2.45 GHz diamond CVD reactor. In this program we will characterize and optimize diamond deposition with this new enhancement, developing the necessary processing modifications to use it to full advantage. This will pave the way to introducing it into commercial production equipment in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The goal of this effort is a family of adaptive passive damping elements that will improve performance, endurance and survivability of future advanced space and missile systems. The innovation is twofold: the damping elements will be advanced tuned-mass dampers (TMDs) that (1) use magnetically induced eddy currents as the dissipation mechanism and (2) have an adaptive frequency tuning scheme. As the most weight-effective means of increasing narrowband structural damping, TMDs will contribute significantly toward improved performance requirements: a robust magnetic damping mechanism will withstand high-G launch and environmental effects, including temperature extremes, and the capability for adaptive frequency tuning will extend the utility of TMDs to volatile dynamic environments. Magnetic TMDs will be developed with self-sensing, actuating spring elements to enable the devices to track and damp a structural mode(s) as it changes in frequency with environmental or mission conditions. These highly predictable, all-metal dampers will require no power during normal operation, will be unaffected by temperature variations, and will not age or outgas. The end product of this work will be a family of affordable, modular, smart damping elements which will enhance future spacecraft designs by attacking a broad range of vibration problems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Improving the speed and efficiency of DNA sequencing methods is essential to the success of the Human Genome Program and to the success of many biotechnology companies such as CuraGen. DNA sequencing remains the rate determining step in much of genetic research. Our goal (and the subject of this proposal) is to dramatically increase the speed and efficiency of gel electrophoresis sequencing using fluorescently tagged DNA. We will investigate the upper throughput bounds of this method by (1) increasing optical format and efficiency, (2) massively increasing the lane density and, hence, the number of samples per run, and (3) improving data handling efficiency through software and dye coding strategies. Sensitivity and throughput increases of 20 fold each may be realized through implementation of optical improvements and a new separation technique. The optical spectroscopy, computation, mathematics, engineering and molecular biology backgrounds present at CuraGen combine with a strong consulting base to put us in a unique position to conceive and carry out this effort. If successful, the instrumental advances achieved in Phase I will be developed into a Phase II prototype. The Phase II prototype will be capable of accepting standard 96 well microtitration plates directly and have an immense commercial advantage over existing systems.",

THIS STUDY AIMS TO (1) DEFINE THE 9-10 AMINO ACIDS THAT CONSTITUTE THE CORE CTL EPITOPES, (2) MODIFY THESE PEPTIDES TO ENHANCE THEIR STABILITY, FACILITATE UPTAKE INTO ANTIGEN PRESENTING CELLS AND ENHANCE IMMUNOGENICITY BY ADDING HELPER EPITOPES, AND (3) DETERMINE IF THESE PEPTIDES CAN GENERATE CTL'S IN VIVO (IN HLA-A2 TRANSGENIC MICE). DURING THE PHASE I STUDY, RESEARCH EFFORTS WILL BE CONDUCTED ON EACH OF THE THREE SPECIFIC AIMS. WE WILL IDENTIFYTHE OPTIMAL LENGTH CYTOTOXIC T CELL ANTIGENIC PEPTIDE, HBCAG 18-27, CHEMICALLY MODIFY IT AND DEMONSTRATE THE IMMUNOGENICITY OF THE MODIFIED PEPTIDE IN HLA-A2 TRANSGENIC MICE IN THE ABSENCEOF ADDED ADJUVANTS. WE WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF OUR ULTIMATE GOAL OF PRODUCING A THERAPEUTIC VACCINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC HEPATITIS B VIRUS INFECTION.",

Using technology for the simultaneous measurement of 5 parameters, the abnormal expression of normal antigens can be used to identify leukemic populations. Distinction between normal and abnormal cells can be made by a highly trained scientist using a computer program which permits visualization of multidimensional data. We will demonstrate the utility of artificial neural network technology to reproduce an identification made by a trained scientist. We will focus on two forms of acute leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), as test specimens to be compared with normal bone marrow specimens. Using this technology, we will characterize acute leukemias and report their relative positions in a multidimensional data space. We will also investigate whether the neural network can extract more information from the data set than the expert scientist.",

At the current levels of technology and in the present regulatory environment, thedevelopment of such a system will play an important role in laboratory quality, and will likely reach themarket long before an automated primary screening device. The basic goal of the Phase I feasibilitystudy is to establish the presence of MACs using the preparation, optoelectronics, and features availableon a basic Cytyc scanning instrument. New and innovative aspects of this application include theapplication of MACs in a wide scale screening environment (previous work with MACs has involvedmanual selection of cells, manual focus, and only limited testing) and, in addition, the use of such aninstrument as a low cost QC technique rather than a primary screener. In Phase II a fully automatedprototype would be developed and tested, including a user interface.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal focuses on the development of an in-situ atmospheric sensor capable of identifying and evaluating regions of corrosion occurring specifically on aircraft. The sensor is antiucipated to have an electrode applied on the coating of the test coupon. When this electrode and coupon are exposed to moisture, either by immersion or high humidity, the near de impedance of the coating-metal system decreases by one to two orders of magnitude. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements using these test electrode sensors, a potentiostat and lock-in amplifier will be correlated with adhesion of the paint to the metal substrate and corresion of the substrate. Ellipsometry and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy will be used to quantitatively assess the de-adheion to the amount of corresion occurring. In this way, the sensor offers a quantitative measure of incipient corrosion unlike other corrosion monitors that simply measure the time of wetness or the corrosion rate of the sensor itself, or that require externam electrodes and a bulk electrolyte medium.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This work will demonstrate a novel signal processing paradigm for voice authentication. In addition, a statistical analysis technique for the evaluation and improvement of any authentication method will be developed, along with a preliminary database to support the evaluation. This includes a method for constructing a reference identification database, and a method for continuously scanning a speaker's voice to authenticate their identity. Software will extract a predetermined set of sounds which uniquely specify certain physiological characteristics of the speaker. These sounds will be processed to obtain a set of discriminating parameters unique to a specific individual's voice, yet flexible enough to allow changes which occur during normal speech. The authentication decision will be made by a neural network using the discriminating parameters. The network will take advantage of the flexibility and reliability of the proposed techniques. The training and testing of the network be achieved using the aforementioned database. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The ability to reliably verify the identity of an individual based on a small, quickly computable set of parameters has numberous applicatons in the military and civilian sectors. These include enhanced communication security; operator ID verification for voice controlled equipment; and customer ID verification for bank and credit cards.",

In this unified model, we will represent not only the positive information represented by the sensor contacts but the intelligence information received from all sources, negative information across sensor systems and across platforms, threat level information produced by simulated tactical projections, and real-time environmental information from fleet predictions.

First, it will add processing for new sensors and off board link input to the basic algorithm. Second, it will implement an interim gridlock algorithm to permit registration of position, azimuth, and time latency from off board data sources. Third, it will implement a new and sophisticated passive tracking algorithm, to provide the ability to determine range accurately from passive sensors only. Fourth, it will provide interfaces to accept and respond to operator commands from the Air Force's prototype user system interface. And fifth, it will replace the current FORTRAN sensor level correlation algorithm with a newer version, in Ada.",

Modeling results of different polymers and of the same polymers under different conditions will be compared with each other and with experimental data to determine what structural elements of PC give it it's unique ballistic properties. Structure property relationship analysis using the newly available software package QSPR-Polymer will allow pre-modeling screening of hundreds of derivatives based on PC, PMMA and PES. Promising QSPR candidates will be cycled through the modeling protocal in order to enhance our understanding and hypotheses, which will ultimately lead to the proposal of new transparent polymers with significantly improved ballistic performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Data Fusion Corporation proposes the Phase I investigation of integrated sensor management and information fusion of distributed sensor resources among flights of tactical aircraft for air-to-ground operations. This effort will examine using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensors in conjunction with internetted aircraft, inertial navigation (INS), and the Global Positioning System (GPS). Key elements will be the systematic exploitation, management, and fusion of SAR and FLIR imagery to improve the accuracy of fire control solutions for ground targets. The effort will focus on four main technical areas. First, invariant theory, for performing point transfers, will be extended to the statistical case for SAR and FLIR fusion. Invariant theory is especially powerful since it does not require ground truth or knowledge of the imaging geometry. Second, a method for intersecting measurements probabilistically will be employed to reduce false alarms in high clutter scenarios. Third, the effort will consider operational and sensor management issues such as cueing of FLIR from SAR or off-board assets. Finally, an error model and preliminary performance estimates will be created that integrate the sensors, the developed methods for fusion, and the capabilities of INS/GPS navigation.",

Specifically, since almost all helmet mounted displays are developed for the fighter/attack fixed-wing mission or the attack/scout rotary-wing mission, the question as to whether the available and near-term technology is readily adaptable to the E-2C AWACS mission requirements. To answer this question, in-depth analysis of mission related operational requirements will be performed to determine minimum performance requirements for any display system to meet. Research into helmet mounted display technology will then be performed to determine if current technology can meet these requirements. As part of this analysis, helmet mounted displays will be compared to flat panel displays to assess the effectiveness of the two technologies in meeting the operational requirements. Finally, a research roadmap will be proposed for further study in the effective display of information for the E-2C crew. The combined research, analysis, and assessments will form the basis for a recommended approach in meeting the needs of the E-2C cockpit crew.",

The database developed will provide the basis for the analysis and decision portions of the study. This process leads to the evaluation and recommendation conclusion which will be the study results as presented in the final report.

However, the lowest cost configuration, in which an infrared diode laser is frequency doubled in a nonlinear waveguide, does not offer the capacity for blue light generation at high evough power levels. We have devised a modified waveguide fabrication technique which can significantly reduce the device cost and increase the output power. In Phase I we will demonstrate the technology behind our new waveguide approach and in Phase II we will optimize the design and demonstrate its full potential.",

However, the best 350 nm source, the Argon-ion laser, is incompatible with a table-top instrument since it requires installing permanent support utilities. This constraint has prevented the clinical use of techniques such as DNA sorting which would help determine treatment strategies for cancer patients, and it has limited researchers in problems such as AIDS research which require semi-clinical data. This project will develop a diode laser based UV light source which makes possible a table-top UV flow cytometer. In Phase I, we will build a UV source to demonstrate the new optics technology required for success. This will be the first diode-laser UV source. We will also work with our collaborators at Stanford University and Los Alamos National Laboratory to identify methods to evaluate a cytometer based on this source. In Phase II, we will construct prototypes, install them into our collaborators' cytometry machines, and begin experiments to demonstrate the system performance. In Phase III, we will work with a manufacturer to develop a commercial table-top diode-based multi-wavelength cytometry system.",

Bistatic and multistatic tomographic image processing techniques and algorithms at HF frequencies form the basis of the proposed imaging concept. The baseline bistatic/multistatic surveillance system will exploit illuminations from either LOS or OTH transmitters coupled with receivers on a small aircraft to detect buried targets by forming tomographic images of the target returns. Imaging at multiple frequencies and polarization diversity will be studied to identify targets on the surface and at various depths. lssues will be investigated including waveforms, antennas, receivers, processing and advanccd navigation systems/auto focusing techniques.

Presently, the method of TBC design is based on physical experiments which are time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, the interpretation of experimental data is difficult due to the complexity of the variables and their interactions in determining TBC performance and life. In Phase I, 2D FEA will be performed to investigate variable complexities in order to define specific design rules. The use of FEA as an automated experimental method will speed TBC development by providing a means of separating complex variable interactions. The definition of specific design rules will lead to a directed design methodology that will enable the development of spall resistant, high performance TBC's.",

This technique will be based on stabiliogram-diffusion analysis, which is a novel methodology for examining quiet-standing balance. During Phase I the specific aims are 1) to evaluate the ability of stabiologram-diffusion analysis to discriminate between health individuals and individuals with bilateral vestibular dysfunction, 2) to gain a preliminary understanding of how the vestibular system is integrated into the postural control system and 3) to begin developing a multivariate statistical technique that can be used to identify and diagnose individuals with vestibular disorders and evaluate quantitatively the progress of rehabilitation therapies applied to such individuals. The long-term objectives during Phase II are 1) evaluate the ability of stabilogram-diffusion analysis to discriminate between healthy individuals and individuals with different forms of vestibular dysfunction, 2) to establish a normative posturographic database, 3) to demonstrate the viability of the technique in providing quantitative assessments of vestibular function in individuals undergoing rehabilitation, 4) to provide an advanced software and hardware prototype of the system for evaluating vestibular function.",

At Derivation Systems, Inc. we believe that in over for formal methods to reach their full potential, a formal design tool must support the generative and deductive aspects of design. We also believe that for a formal design tool to be practical, it must integrate with existing logic synthesis tools to generate hardware realizations. We propose the development of DRS (Derivational Reasoning System), a design tool which reflects a formal approach to digital design founded in derivational reasoning. The significance of the innovation is the development of a design tool which integrates derivation with existing verification and logic synthesis tools in a unified framework. This will allow designers to construct correct hardware from high level abstract specifications.",

No device existsthat would allow this procedure to be performed without open biopsy. Therefore, we will design a radiofrequency (rf) receiver coil for breast MR imaging with integrated stereotaxic capabilities. This coilwould perform dual roles: receiving signal from the breast to form an MR image, and allowing MRimaging-guided biopsy and needle localizations. This coil will be a modification of the 3-turn solenoidalbreast coil Tl03, designed by the PI, and currently in clinical use on the l.5-tesla GE Signa imager of MRImaging center.

Existing detection modalities such as contrast venography, ultrasound, and non-specific radiopharmaceuticals do not exhibit the sensitivity or specificity in all areas of interest to reliably detect DVT or PE. A Tc-99m radiolabeled thrombus-binding peptide would be ideally suited to this task by virtue of its specificity, favorable pharmacokinetics, and low-cost isotope, and widely available nuclear medicine facilities. As platelets are a component of thrombi, synthetic peptides that bind with high affinity to the GPIIb/IIIa receptor on the surface of activated platelets provide a rational basis for the development of a thrombus-specific radiopharmaceutical. We now have preliminary in vitro and in vivo data that indicate that this is a viable approach. We propose to build on our initial work by synthesizing additional Tc-99m labelable peptides with improved thrombus-binding and pharmacokinetic characteristics. We also propose to evaluate them in vitro and in animal models of DVT and PE. The peptide(s) exhibiting optimal characteristics will be selected for biodistribution and toxicological studies in support of clinical trials for the diagnosis of DVT and PE.",

It will differ significantly from previous aspheric interferometers in two key aspects. First, its elegant simplicity will allow easy operation and independent verification of all aspects of system calibration. Second, the proposed instrument will use affordable photomask quality CGH nulls to produce aspheric wavefronts which are everywhere perpendicular to the test optic. In a Phase I program, we propose to complete a detailed optical and preliminary mechanical design of proposed instrument. We also propose construction of a breadboard optical model to demonstrate several key features of the CGH-LUPI interferometer.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop effective monostatic and bistatic adaptive processing techniques for shallow water Low Frequency Active (LFA) operationa. The focus of our proposed research is to achieve spatial reverberation cancellation for the complex shallow water environment using adaptive beamforming techniques. Our efforts will extend the favorable results we achieved for a deep-water, wideband active sonar adaptive beamformer to the shallow water environment. The previous work resulted in two promising adaptive algorithms: Cholesky Factorization - Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (CF - MVDR) and Constraint Preprocessor/Joint Process Least-Squares Lattice Adaptive Filter (CP/JPLSL). We will apply a beam-space adaptive filter to provide Coherent Spatial Discrimination (CSD). The adaptive filter operates on beam data whereby, in addition to the selected primary beam, one or more adjacent reference beams are selected on each side of the primary beam. The reference beams are constructed such that they receive the interference, but are essentially prevented from receiving signals coming in from the primary beam look direction. The adaptive filter uses the reference beams to provide a good estimate of the interference contaminant in the primary beam. It then subtracts the adaptive filter output from the primary beam output to obtain the desired \"interference canceled\" beam.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose to develop 5 element, linear, monolithic, InGaAs-on-Silicon, spectrally selective detector arrays for the near-infrared spectrum (1.0 - 1.7 um). The technique of selective epitaxy will be used to grow (100x100) um area detector mesas on the silicon substrate. Special methods will be used to practically eliminate the misfit dislocations caused by the severe lattice mismatch between the InO Ga 47As absorption region and the silicon substrate, thus, resulting in a very high quality detector material. The expected room temperature leakage current is less than 10 nA at a reverse bias of 5V. The innovation consists of a new, unique, optically resonant InO.53GaO.47As detector that has a wavelength selective response. This resonant detector not only discriminates different wavelengths in a compact and solid state design, but also has the extended wavelength coverage and improved quantum efficiency over conventional photodetector designs. In addition, the silicon substrate will incorporate low readout noise circuitry using standard CMOS process. These features will represent a major advance in infrared detector array technology.",

Our goal is to develop a practical generic technology for the manufacture of two-dimensional optical signal processing systems in planar optics. Our primary focus will be on the use of diffractive optical elements (DOEs) and ferroelectric liquid crystal spatial light modulators (FLC-SLMs) along wit the necessary light sources and detectors. FLC-SLMs meet requirements of the solicitation (kHz frame rates, scalability to 1000x1000 pixels) and the use of DOEs offers the flexibilty and ease of assembly needed for a cost effectivwe generic technology. We will also plan for the use of active devices such as SEEDs and quantum wells. Our Phase I objectives are: (1) identify crucial technial issues in the use of DOEs for planar optical systems through design, fabrication, and test of key optics, (2) identify and address crucial issues in module assembly and component mounting through experimentation with key manufacturing steps, (3) test key performance parameters of electro-optic components available in Phase I, and (4) develop a preliminary design and manufacturing process for a Phase II planar optical processor. Our choices of components and manufacturing processes will be strongly influenced by their cost and ease of manufacture.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A low cost approach to fire detection is proposed which utilizes color ad CCD Machine Vision Flame Detectors (MVFDS) and a new infrared imaging MVFDS to monitor engine overheat/burn-throughs as a possible replacement for thermal wire. It may also have flame detection potential. The IR focal plane array consists of over 80,000 microbolometers on a SI chip which can resolve small temperature differences on the surface of an engine in high temperature backgrounds. This new detector will use four fiber optic cables, vibration protected, interfaced to the chip, routed from the camera in an adjacent bay into the nacelle bay. One detector per engine will serve as four detectors and the four subimages compose a single image which is processed at speeds of 10-30 frames/sec as is now done with color MVFDS. The system has a low LCC, costs less than thermal wire and provides higher benefits of temperature resolution and reliability. A video output to the pilot will also be provided. The color CCD MVFDS will be tested and software developed to simultaneously measure smoke concentration. Blue and red LEDs will be used as emittters in various locations of the camera's FOV. The transmissivity and optical density will be measured as well as ratios of each color intensity. This ability will save the cost of using separate smoke detectors. It is proposed to use the MVFDS to monitor color changes of reflected light due to changes in temperature of thermochromic liquid crystal materials. These inexpensive materials change color as their surface temperature changes. By measuring color changes of these materials while simultaneously monitoring for flame and smoke, potential overheat and hidden fire conditions can be located and wanrnings given.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Power dissipation is becoming critically important in large scale systems particularly with the increasing need for portability. Research into design techniques for reducing power has been hindered by the inability of design tools to include power dissipation in the early stages of the design process. A method to incorporate nodal activity into Algorithm Specific Architecture Programmable (ASAP) VHDL chip generators has been established. This capability will enable the development of a correlation between power dissipation and a weighted sum of nodal activity. This will result in the ability to quickly evaluate the power dissipation of a system while it is still described at a technology independent, high level of abstraction. We then propose to investigate using this capability to enable the transition of two low power design approaches from academic concepts to useful techniques as part of a next generation low power design methodology. We will investigate a reduced voltage approach which maintains throughput by pipelining and a self-timed approach which is data driven (asynchronous) instead of clock driven. In addition to reduced power, attributes associated with a top down VHDL-based methodology will be preserved: reduced time-to-market, technology independence, technology retargeting/upgrading, and design re-use.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A team of Duncan Technologies and Aerojet Propulsion Division will develop a smart laser ignition system for reaction control system (RCS) thrusters using O/H propellants. The system will provide ignition to multiple thrusters enabling accurate sequencing of RCS engine clusters. A single laser firing unit will deliver laser light through optical fibers to laser ignition assemblies mounted in multiple RCS thrusters. The laser energy will heat a target in the laser ignition assemblies above the autoignition temperature of O/H mixtures. Laser ignition assemblies will be designed for use in torch type igniters and resonator cavities. The latter type of igniter can potentially eliminate the requirement for valves dedicated to igniter propellant control, instead relying on propellants from the main thruster valves. Elimination of these valves simplifies RCS thruster operation, reduces weight, and decreases system complexity. Built-in-test systems will verify system readiness and ignition. Advanced optical diagnostics for measurement of mixture ratio, pressure, and combustion stability can be incorporated into the system. An embedded processor will control laser firing, BIT functions, and communications with the propulsion or vehicle controller via a MIL-STD 1553B digital bus interface.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Impulse response radars present a major detection problem for current and developmental Electronic Support Measure (ESM) receivers. These signals are characterized by short pulse durations and wide bandwidths, for which current and developmental ESM receivers are not optimized. Detection and characterization of received radar impulses would enable classification of the emitting radar source, including measurement of pulsewidth and pulse repetition frequency. Dynetics proposes a novel nonlinear signal processing approach to solve the impulse and ultra-wide-band radar detection problem. Specific advantages of nonlinear approaches are: 1. Narrowband signals from a dense signal environment are removed prior to pulse detection, 2. Input signal-to-noise ration (SNR) is not degraded, and 3. Pulse detection is performed in the time domain (SNR optimized). To analyze linear and nonlinear detection algorithms, Dynetics has developed an ESM computer simulation. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the benefits of this type of impulse detection. Specific issues to be resolved during Phase I include assessing intercept receiver requirements, specification of nonlinear processing techniques for the detection, characterization, and direction finding of impulse radars, and selection of an optimal approach. In addition, a preliminary design and analysis of the optimal ESM receiver will be performed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Dynetics, teamed with Harris Corporation, proposes to integrate our innovative optical receiver technology with existing components to produce a novel Soldier Identification System. Our unique approach couples a specially designed, hand-held interrogation unit and a small, passive responder located on the soldier. In operation, the interrogator transmits a 1024-bit coded sequence to the soldier via a highly directional laser diode beam. Within this sequence is a smaller, seven-symbol sequence that opens an electronic shutter and exposes a low-cost retroreflecting tape that returns an optical flash to the interrogator. The presence and timing of this flash establishes identification and makes the Soldier Identification System robust to countermeasures. The Dynetics proposed solution has a very small package size, is lightweight, and is resistant to countermeasures, all of which are critical for practical field uses. During Phase I, Dynetics will finalize the design, demonstrate key system aspects with a laboratory demonstration, and document systematic investigation of Phase III markets. This research will allow rapid development of a prototype device in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Eagle Eye will develop a highly reliable, miniature transponder that will permit a user to accurately locate the transponder using a satellite communication system. The transponder will be small enough to fit inside a wristwatch case and it could be worn on a wrist or packaged into an inconspicous place in a sensitive piece of hardware. In the event that a person such as a Special Forces operative or a downed Air Force pilot needs to be rescued, a low earth orbiting satellite will interrogate the transponder tag to determine its position. The Eagle Eye system will use a satellite system scheudled to be operational later this year. This SBIR Phase I proposal is to develop the most critical technology for the concept, the MMIC transmit/receive front end in a multichip module package. Eagle Eye will also develop a plan to demonstrate the product with the low orbit satellite. Key technologies for the concept include Microwave monolithic Integrated Circuits, MultiChip Module packaging to miniaturize a transponder, thermal control of the package, and an innovative differential Doppler location technique. The basic technology in each of these critical items has been developed by the Department of Defense. Thus, this system development represent commercialization of several DoD technologies as well as a potential dual use military and commercial product. Anticipated Benefits: Anticipated benefits are increased safety for Special Forces missions, increased probability of retrieving downed military pilots, and tracking military cargo and personnel for logistics support. Potential commercial applications of the transponder tags include locating back country hikers, Alzheimer's patients, tagged animals in the wild, and tracking package shipments.",

In this post-Soviet world, U.S. forces will be presented with not only expanded regional conflicts among Third World countries but also an increased nuclear, chemical, and biological (NBC) weapons threat in terms of diversity and frequency. The past decade has shown that many nations have opted to develop NBC weapons programs. This development has been either for aggressive purposes or as a deterrent against a neighbor who possesses or is attempting to possess such weapons. The V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft will be in the forefront of supporting the mission of this post-Cold War power projection fighting force. As such, the V-22 is faced with having to operate and survive in an NBC environment. Therefore, survivability of the V-22 must include NBC detection of contaminants in the aircrew breathing system or environmental control system (ECS) and alert/warn the V-22 crew when unacceptable levels are reached. Detection of the V-22 must be approached in a logical and integrated fashion, whereby, a concept of an NBC detection and warning system for the aircrew system and ECS is developed first. From this concept will evolve the equipment design and prototype upon which detection for the V-22 aircrew system and ECS can be accomplished.",

Phase I objectives will seek to (1) identify efficient PC-based degradation algorithms for environmental modelling (2) investigate real scene database and computer processing requirements for simulating infrared weapon performance in varying environmental conditions, (3) determine architectures for upgrading NAVAIR training devices for infrared Maverick and SLAM with environmentral degradation modules. Multimedia technologies will be considered to optimize PC configuration for video storage, image processing, dynamic simulating and graphic realism. PC-based training devices for the laser and infrared Maverick will provide proof of concept opportunities for the proposed Phase I and Phase II SBIR effort.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The development of coatings with electrically tunable infrared emittance for controlling radiant heat transfer in the space environment is proposed. The emittance modulation is achieved using electrochromic materials whose infrared reflectance can be continuously and reversibly modulated. The coatings have a multilayer, thin film structure that allows emittance to be switched in response to a low voltage DC signal. Innovations in electrochromic materials, infrared transparent electrical contacts, and vacuum deposition processes which allow fabrication of the coatings with a large emittance modulation are proposed. The objective of the Phase I program is the fabrication and characterization of variable emittance coatings employing crystalline LixWO3 as the variable reflectance component. Emittance switching between ~0.2-0.8 in the 3-14 um wavelength range is sought for Phase I coatings. The coatings may be attached to external surfaces of spacecraft, individual instrument packages, or on radiator surfaces. They will allow a non-mechanical means of temperature control and heat distribution through radiant transfer between exterior and interior surfaces. These capabilities should greatly enhance the performance and flexibility of thermal management systems without adding significant weight or complexity.",

In addition to visible and near-infrared transmittance, the binders are chemically tailored to have no significant absorption bands in either the 3-5 m or 8-1 m atmospheric windows, increasing the choice and effectiveness of pigments used for signature control. In Phase I, three novel binders based on aromatic polyamide polymers will be synthesized and characterized. The aromatic stabilization imparts chemical and high temperature stability allowing the binders to meet chemical agent resistant coating (CARC) requirements. Spectral emissivities and complex indices of refraction of the binders will be determined from spectroscopic measurements (0.2-26 m) and resistance to CW-related chemicals evaluated. The relationship between the chemistry and microstructure of binders and the required chemical and electro-optical properties will be established and used as a strategy for further binder development. The binders are synthesized from inexpensive chemicals readily available in bulk quantities and will be formulated as a two-component paint system with minimal solvent requirements and low VOC emission. The Phase II effort would focus on optimizing binder properties, incorporating pigments for low emissivity and visual camouflage, and modeling the optical properties of various pigment and binder combinations.

The north finder in operation would use its FOG rate sensor(s) to determine the Earth's rotation vector in a local horizontal plane. The direction of the vector in this plane points to true north. This technology provides a direct true north orientation which is independent of weather, blockage, and jamming, an advantage which other technologies such as magnetic compass and GPS cannot claim. The Phase I effort will define a baseline specification for a north finder based on FOG technology and the weapon system requirements, determine the optimal configuration of a north finder system, determine methods for coupling the reference orientation to the weapon system, and demonstrate the feasibility of extending the existing technology performance, in both FOG sensors and FOG based north finders, to meet the accuracy/time requirements of the weapon system application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The detection of specific DNA sequences for the diagnosis of genetic diseases, cancer, and infectious disease is becoming increasingly widespread. A number of innovative techniques have been employed, including the oligonucleotide ligation assay and reverse dot-blot hybridization. The end-point, and to a certain extent the effectiveness of these assays, is determined by the sensitivity of the DNA detection techniques used. Progress has been significantly enhanced through the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, implementation of PCR can be expensive as well as equipment and expertise intensive. We have applied a technique with proven effectiveness in the field of immunoassays for the non-isotopic detection of DNA; initial data indicates an increase in sensitivity 10(2)-10(3) times higher than conventional techniques. The assay, which we have called EDNA-ELCA, uses the amplification of the coagulation cascade to produce a calorimetrically detectable end product. A DNA template is labelled with biotin and a haptene, and is then immobilised in a streptavidin coated microtiter plate. An antibody against the haptene is conjugated to a snake venom coagulation activator (RVVXa), and introduced into the microtiter well. The assay is then developed by the addition of coagulation factors, including an enzyme labelled fibrinogen. The deposition of enzyme labelled fibrin is indicative of a positive reaction. We have chosen three specific applications to prove the utility of this method. They are detection of the deltaF508 mutation of cystic fibrosis, a codon 12 mutation in the first exon of K- ras for colon cancer, and the mecA gene in methicillin resistant Staphlococcus aureus.",

A program is proposed to demonstrate the merits of fused salt deposition of rhenium on various refractory substrates using current manipulating techniques such as pulsed current and periodic current reversal to refine microstructures and improve mechanical properties. Fused salts have been successfully used to deposit other refractory metals, but rhenium deposition from such baths has been overlooked in favor of chemical vapor deposition (CVD). CVD has been the predominant technique for rhenium electrodeposition, but this method is extensive and yields a metal of inferior quality to that expected from the fused salt bath. Rhenium deposits shall be characterized from melts of various base chemistries, and responses to thermal treatment on several substrates will be examined.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Lead is a widespread environmental contaminant occurring in airborne, soil, and aqueous media. It is a deleterious, cumulative body poison and its health effects are usually not reversible. Indoor and outdoor small arms firing ranges may contain serious airborne contamination from lead and other heavy metals that potentially threaten the safety of personnel that use these facilities as part of their training regimen. The purpose of this effort is to develop a compact, portable, cost-effective lead in air monitor that allows personnel to use the range undisturbed, but provides a record of ambient lead concentration and warns of a potential health risk. The instrument will be capable of both AC and DC operation. Innovations proposed will allow air samples to be taken automatically, potentially from several locations within the range so that one instrument can service an entire facility. The unit will also be autocalibrating to allow long-term operation without requiring maintenance nor disrupting the concentration of field personnel. The proposed designs will also permit expansion of instrument capabilities to other metals and soil/water analyses. The proposed technology will also be applicable as the basis for an inexpensive process for removing lead from the surrounding air as it is produced, thereby reducing or eliminating the health hazard in real time. This would also decrease contamination of surrounding soil and water, saving immense clean-up costs.",

The approach will be directed towards development of pattern recognition schemes based upon the initial on-line acquisition of electrochemical impedance spectra using Fast Fourier Transform Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (FFTEIS) instrumentation from the suspect corrosion site. This will be followed by implementation of a Neural Network Analysis (NNA) to the impedance data obtained. The resulting NNA transformed data will then be utilized by software based pattern recognition techniques to classify the hidden chemical corrosion site. The experimental program will be performed by: i) fabrication of laboratory FFTEIS instrumentation incorporating preferred components, ii) performing impedance measurements on relevant metal substrates subjected to hidden chemical corrosion, iii) developing and training Neural Networks for unambiguously detecting and determining the severity of hidden chemical corrosion on the subject metal substrates and iv) fabricating and performance testing prototype instrumentation.",

The proposed innovation is a replacement for existing temperature compensation techniques for RF amplifiers, especially those amplifiers using GaAs FET elements. The PTCA will reduce the size and cost, and increase the reliability and power efficiency of the amplifier compensation. The effort will consist of: the design and layout of the attenuator resistors and terminations, a software simulation and analysis of the design, the development of thickfilm thermistor inks followed by fabricating and testing a prototype. Upon completion, this project will yield a working unit that can be used to replace temperature compensating circuits using active variable attenuators (Typically with GaAs FET or PIN diode elements) that are controlled by linearized drivers with temperature detection circuits. The resulting increase in reliability due to the elimination of active components and the reduction in the total amount of parts is achieved at a fraction of the current expenditure in terms of cost, size and power consumption.",

The Armyuses these lamps in fire-control applications among others. DoD currently has over 1 million curies of tritium in use in these lamps. The Army has been under pressure from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for several years, due to the problems created when conventional lamp breakage occurs. Self-luminous microspheres would provide an answer to NRC's safety concerns and also provide a significant cost savings to DoD due to the reduced amount of tritium required for any given replacement lamp design incorporating self-luminous microspheres. Tritium is $3.19/curie. Many new DoD applications and possibilities will result from the envisioned safer, improved light source. Encapsulight, Inc. and Encapsulight's unique team propose to develop an innovative and unique new machine technology that will provide Encapsulight, Inc. with the capability to produce the envisioned safer, improved light source, radioluminescent microspheres.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Presently available technology for converting logistic fuels to hydrogen for use in fuel cells is unsatisfactory in three fundamental ways. First there is the problem that the hydrogen that is produced in the initial fuel gasification step contains impurities such as CO, H,S and NH, which must be removed since they would poison the fuel cell. Secondly the hydroden is diluted with CO, and N2 which make it unsuitable for use in some types of fuel cells and reduce the efficiency with which it can be used in the others. Thirdly to achieve any reasonable efficiency a complex heat recovery system is needed. This proposal describes a new technology for producing hydrogen from high molecular weight liquid fuels which avoids all these problems, i.e. fuel and water are fed to a single reaction vessel and the product coming out is, except for some excess water, virtually pure hydrogen. As is discussed in detail in the proposal there are good reasons to expect that this new technology will be highly efficient at full and part load, have low capital and operating costs relative to presently available technologies, have excellent transient response, near zero emissions of NOx and soot, and will have no materials of construction problems. Anticipated Benefits: Successful development of this technology will greatly increase the number of situations in which fuel cells are the method of choice for generating electricity.",

The study will focus on the materials system consisting of (B1, Sb)2(Te, Se)3 alloys for both p- and n-type thermo-elements. Literature shows that specific compositions in this alloy system have provided high figures of merit (3.2 - 3.4 x IO-3/Deg K at 3OOK) with a maximum Peltier cooling of 77 Deg K. Recently investigators at the University of Virginia reported a high figure of merit of 3.7 x 10-3/K for p- type (Bi, Sb)2(Te, Sb)3 alloy. The process selected for depositing the films in the proposed program will be a unique, high rate Microwave Enhanced CVO process (MECVD) developed at Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. ECD has achieved deposition rates as high as 3OO Deg. A/sec for amorphous Si-H alloys using this technique, and this process has been developed for depostion on large area surfaces. Large area thin/thick film thermoelectric modules will be attractive for applications which require heating/cooling ability in a single, light-weight module.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this program is to design a high energy density hydrogen stroage system, utilizing ECD's extensive experience in metal hydride technology. The system will be based on ECD's ability to develop novel metal hydrides that have the potential to achieve gravimetric energy density of 2.5Wh/kg and volumetric energy density of 2500 kWh/M(3), while also having good hydrogen sorption kinetics, long cycle life, resistance to poisoning and low cost. Such a H-storage system will make the PEM and other types of fuel cells viable for commercial and military applications. Our previous work on disordered, multi-component Mg-based thin film hydrides has already achieved such high value for gravimetric energy density. However, these alloys have good kinetics only above 200oC. We will now attempt to reproduce these high storage capacity alloys in bulk with minimum loss of capacity, and during Phase II, modify them to improve the kinetics at low temperatures. ECDs technological leadership in metal hydrides was recently recognized by the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) when it was awarded a contract ($18.5 million/3 years) for the development of its proprietary nickel metal hydride electric vehicle battery. Anticipated Benefits: High energy density metal hydride systems for hydrogen storage, will allow fuel cell technology to be realized for many defense and commercial applications. The knowledge acquired under the program will also be applicable to a wide range of other products such as hydrogen fueled ICE vehicles and non-CFC heating and cooling systems, resulting in economic competitiveness within the United States.",

Electrolyte concentrations are not optimum for electrode perfor- mance because of solubility and replating of zinc to form treeing (and consequent shorting) and shape change. The objective of the proposed program is to demonstrate the feasibility of the battery with improvements in separator, electrolyte concentration, and positive active material density, and to reach goals of performance which will provide a battery of cells that conveniently fit in a belt or vest and can provide sufficient energy for ventricular assist.",

The innovative feature of the proposed Phase I effort is to combine the novel feature of the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method and the Eulerian/Lagrangian method into a unified solution algorithm for efficient, time-accurate calculations of multiphase free surface flows valid at all speeds. The proposed method reformulated the VOF equation to strongly couple two distinct phases (liquid and gas) and tracks droplets on a lagrangian frame using a unified predictor-corrector technique to account for the non-linear linkages through the convective contributions of VOF. The discontinuities within the sharp interface will be modeled as a volume force to avoid stiffness. The proposed method will be implemented into the FDNS code which has three-dimensional, multi- zone and combined Eulerian-Lagrangian capabilities. Further exten sions of the current proposed algorithm for handling other flow processes such as turbulence, droplet coalescence and chemistry are extremely feasible.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The proposed innovation is to develop thin inorganic barrier coatings to protect bare chip-on-substrate (COS) multichip modules in lieu of normally used heavy and bulky ceramic/metal cavity packages. Inorganic coatings will be deposited over assembled microcircuits precoated with stress-free, high-purity polymers, sealing them from external moisture and internal outgassing. Previous work involved plastic encapsulation alone or inorganic coatings followed by plastic encapsulation. These approaches suffer from either non-hermeticity or exposure of the assembled circuit to high deposition temperatures. Reversing the sequence obviates these problems. This project will analyze and select compatible inorganic and organic coatings to reliably protect COS microelectronics from extreme terrestrial and space environments. Based on Phase I, experimental validation of the approach will be planned for Phase II. A 6-month effort consisting of assessment, evaluation and selection of a COS packaging approach for multichip modules and preliminary experimental studies are proposed. This technology will provide NASA and the commercial community with a weight/volume reduction of 50-80% for each module-important in achieving NASA's goal for the next generation of microspacecraft. There is also a potential reliability improvement (interconnections will be reduced by 50%) and cost reduction (eliminates large high-I/O count cavity packages).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         There is great interest in systems for preserving a practical corporate memory of the design of complex devices for use in re- design and diagnosis throughout the device lifecycle. Dedal is a proven, model-based approach to the structuring and retrieval of large amounts design information. The goal of this research is to bring Dedal technology developed at the NASA Ames Research Center to bear on design information that is represented as World Wide Web hyperdocuments. The World Wide Web (WWW) is a networkwide effort that provides documents to an increasing number of sophisticated client programs for reading and navigation. Dedal technology would provide a significant improvement in retrieval where its model-based structuring was appropriate. In Phase I we plan to establish that the Dedal technology can be translated from its current environment into the more standard C/C++ programming environment while still maintaining the necessary functionality. In addition, we will determine modifications and enhancements that will be necessary to take advantage of the different way that data is encoded in WWW format versus the current representation for design data that is currently used by Dedal.",

Rapid displacement of water from the surfaces, including recessed cavities, of the parts being dried. b. Rapid desorption of the water displacement surfactant by subsequent rinsing in fluorinated liquid to nonsignificant residual levels. c. Be noncorrosive and capatible with the majority of materials of construction used in the manufacture of electronic and precision-engineered parts. d. Exhibit zero ozone depletion potential. These formulations should also be effective in terms of removing particulate contaminants that may be present on these parts. Candidate formulations would be examined. The parameters that would be investigated include the structure, molecular weight, and concentration of the non-ionic fluorcarbon surfactants, and the composition of the carrier liquid. Feasibililty tests would be performed with the most promising formulation on actual electronic and precision-engineered parts of interest to the Air Force.",

It is hypothesized that bioaugmentation of contaminated aquifers with microorganisms capable of greater sediment penetration (adhesion deficient), continuous enzyme expression (constitutive), and prolonged activity (energy enriched) will significantly improve in situ bioremediation efforts at DOD and other sites. It is believed that the use of specialized organisms will minimize many of the previously-recognized limitations of bioaugmentation including, wellhead plugging, requirement of toxic inducers, and oxygen depletion and competition-for-resources associated with adding nutrients to aquifers to prolong microbial activity. This work will expand Envirogen's collection of commercially applicable specialized degradative microorganisms (Phase I), demonstrate the efficacy of using them for in situ remediation (Phase II), demonstrate the economical and commercial feasibility of bioaugmentation for in situ remediation (Phase II), and demonstrate the field application of the organisms for in situ remediation of a contaminated aquifer (Phase III). The work will not involve genetic engineering, but rather the selection of specialized variants, and utilization of advanced fermentation techniques to complete the project goals.",

The sodium Sulfide/Ferrous Sulfate chromium reduction neutral metal precipitation process, is an Air Force patented process which has been demenstrated in an existing Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant at Tinker AFB, OK. Implementation of the process resulted in an 80 percent reduction in sludge generation and 40 percent reduction in chemical usage. Environmental Research and Development, Inc. has an exclusive license to the process.

This Phase I effort screens this group of solvents (both in pure form and in blends with conventional solvents) for top-ranking solvent candidates and provides initial laboratory validation of cleaning effectiveness and thermal stability. The result of this Phase I effort will be a set of six to ten top-ranked solvents to undergo comprehensive testing in Phase II. OPTION TASK: None submitted.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The mechanism of immobility osteopenia is a complex phenomenon of both biochemical and mechanical etiology. This study is designed to investigate the hypothesis that changes in patterns of both known and unknown small molecular weight compounds (e. g., tyrosine and tryptophan metabolites, neurotransmitters, cofactors, peptides and purines). This study can predict and precede or trigger changes in the balance of anabolic and catabolic processes ultimately resulting in osteopenia. The work will examine the osteopenia inducing human bedrest model as compared with seasonal bear metabolism as a model where osteopenia does not occur. Coulometric Electrode Array Systems (CEAS) will be used to isolate patterns of 4-500 compounds at the picogram level from plasma. Developmental software will be employed for complete pattern matching and data base transfer of 40-60 known and 200-300 unknown compounds. Existing plasma samples from 200-250 seasonal bear, 100-150 human bedrest study subjects, and 30-40 rats will be analyzed. Initial CEAS analysis of summer and winter bear plasma corroborates the theory that, fueled by the bear's winter lipid metabolism, protein synthesis proceeds at higher rates in winter than during summer. There were significant differences in serotonergic, kynurenic, dopaminergic, purine and peptide profiles. Pattern changes in small molecular weight nitrogen cycle metabolites may represent evolutionary adaptation coping with environmental factors and offering osteoregulatory mechanisms mitigating torpor's immobility effects. The data will be analyzed for inter and intraspecies differences in metabolic profiles that may be potential triggers or suppressors of osteopenia. Particular attention will be paid to acquiring information regarding the timing and pattern changes in anabolic metabolism. The data will guide design of a Phase II effort to investigate potential endogenous pharmaceuticals for suppression of osteopenia.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A hierarchical dual-function terrain data set must be designed to ensure rapid access to complex data structures, allow for frequent data modification and be compatible with existing Geographical Information System (GIS) applications. Although widely used, conventional database management systems have shortcomings in their ability to handle geographic information efficiently. An object-oriented database (OODB) design is proposed for the development of a hierarchical dual-function terrain data set. To prove the feasibility of this approach, tasks are outlined that together will develop and test a compilation strategy that will convert an existing data set into an object-based data set. In addition, the concept of providing the OODB the ability to convert itself into a format compatible with existing GIS applications is explored. The enhanced speed and flexibility of an OODB promises to find widespread use in the growing comercial and government GIS market. Data development and maintenance costs will decrease due to the increased portability and natural extensibility of the OODB in accommodating new data types such as multimedia.",

To preserve investments made in crating existing databases, a method for automated GIS data conversion is needed. Tools for the conversion of spatial data exists, but the tools for non-spatial data conversion need further development. The overall objective of this project (Phases I and II) is the development of software to analyze, rconcile, and convert non-spatial GIS data from one scheme to another. The proposal is for the Phase I effort. The rule-base of a rule-based expert system will be developed and demonstrated. The effects of conversion between various GIS database structural architectures, and between various logical and physical formats will be analyzed. An appropriate rule set that addresses issues such as the applicability of traditional software techniques, data precision, error correction, and the reporting of data conversion quality will be created. The rule set will be demonstrated through a simplified converson on paper. The effort will progress in three parts: information gathering, analysis, and a demonstration, which will be incorporated into the final report. Upon completion of the Phase I effort, a conceptual design of the complete system will be available.",

Predicted performance includes a quantum efficiency of about 3%, a noise factor of approximately 1.3, a rise time of about 200 picoseconds and a gain of greater than 20,000. The primary Phase I objectives include the development of a prototype device with these performance values, and its complete evaluation and characterization. In Phase II, the photodetector will be optimized, and tailored for specific applications. EOO, Inc. and its subcontractor INTEVAC will perform the proposed work.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The InP material system has been somewhat slow to develop for electrical devices commercially due to the general complexity of the associated alloys. The majority of work presently completed has been with Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). While this technology offers many advantages in terms of growth, it suffers one major limitation related to InP--an inability to use phosphorous in the material compounds. This has resulted in very little work being done with InP as an epitaxial layer, preferring to use InO.52A10.48As instead. The desire to fabricate a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) withthis aluminum alloy has resulted in devices with less than spectacular performance. The fundamental difficulty has been the inability of the In0.52A10.48As to support the types of high voltages need for power applications. By using a growth technique with the capabilities for phosphorous compounds, Organometallic Chemical Vapor Deposition (OMCVD), a more comprehensive investigation can be made to identify the improvements to be gained by substituting InP as a large band gap material in place of In0.52A10.48As. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The benefits will be realized through lower cost components for use in various microwave and millimeter wave applications. The cost of MMIC's for automotive and communication applications will see dramatic reduction.",

Our low power architecture includes 3V off-the-shelf CMOS electronics, a low power scalar output piezoelectric accelerometer, and a novel method of event triggered recording. The scalar method of detecting acceleration conserves both calculation requirements and memory size. Event triggering allows the use of a low power standby mode.

For this Phase I we will fabricate 10 functional prototypes which fully meet the requirements of less than 20 pounds weight (target weight is under 1 pound), including batteries, for 30 days operation for sensing shock, vibration, temperature, and humidity. Sensors to detect and log additional environmental parameters will be investigated, as will power line modem communication.

The low heat capacity of a diamond substrate makes it possible to build sensitive bolometers with a fast response time. No one has yet deposited high quality YBa2Cu307 (YBCO) thin films on diamond because of lattice mismatch, chemical contamination, and differences in thermal contraction. Our approach is to combine two established technologies--diamond on silicon, and YBCO on silicon with a YSZ buffer layer - to create diamond-silicon--YSZ-YBCO multilayers, in which the silicon and YSZ serve as a composite buffer layer. This innovation is a promising approach to developing a bolometer which detects infrared radiation at wavelengths 1--100 microns more sensitively than any other detector operating at or above 77K.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Optical fibers have been embeded in polymer and metal matrix composites for fourteen years; this work has identified methods for embedding and limitations due to fiber-matrix interactions and interconnection methods. Concurrently, breakthroughs in fiber-based local area networks have led to reconfigurable fault tolerant architecturers. By embedding the elements of such networks into advanced composites, structurally-integrated avionic circuit module and intra-aircraft high speed communication may be supported onboard future military aircraft. Such systems require the sequenced development of methods for the integration of fibers, fiber components and supporting electronics and optics into composite material systems and structures. The objective of the proposed SBIR program is to study the first phase of this development process-the integration of fibers and first-level fiber interconnect capability into polymer and metal matrix composites. Fiber & Sensor Technologies (F&S;) and its university subcontractor, the Fiber & Elec Optics Research Center (FEORC) at Virginia Tech, are major innovators in the smart materials and structures field. Together, they have performed more than 100 relate embedded fiber/composite materials research programs for government agencies and aerospace companies. The proposed program will build directly upon their substantic experience embedding optical fibers and fiber communication system elements in polymer and metal matrix composites.",

The radiation characteristics of seferal of these antennas have been recently described in a number of papers. We now propose to apply this theory to practical antennas, to be used in fuze sensing applications. We will investigate available techniques for meeting specific requirements for bandwidth and volume. We will also investigate the propagation properties of narrow pulses through several layers of material. The objective of this research is to design a shock-survivable compact antenna for radiating and receiving extremely short pulses. It will have a volume less than 500 cm3 and it will radiate transient signals with risetimes less than l00 ps. Phase I experiments will provide proof of the principle. We will also investigate the propagatin properties of such short pulses.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Many high-power ultra-wideband (UWB) sources produce a single-ended signal that is fed into a transmission line. Normally, one would like to radiate this signal with an antenna, however, many antennas require a differential mode input. A balun is therefore required to convert the source output into a form acceptable to the antenna. The challenges in designing such a balun lie in the need to avoid voltage breakdown and the need to preserve the risetime of the signal. Conventional balun designs fail to meet these requirements, so new designs are required. The objective of this research is to design a balun to convert single-ended high-power UWB signals to balanced signals. Tradeoffs between voltage, bandwidth, and transition length will be evaluated. We will work toward a design in Phase II that maintain an 80 ps pulse with less than 15% risetime degradation or energy loss. The design goal will be to approach 1 MV peak voltage and 100 GW peak power. During Phase I we will develop a design for a balun that appears likely to reach these objectives. We will provide both analysis and, if necessary, simple experiments to support our design.",

Real time data compresson offers the advantage of smaller storage devices and dat alink systems by reducing the volume of data without reducing the information content. FASTMAN has developed an innovative data compression technology based on the Adaptive Wavelet Transform. In this proposal we demonstrate its ability to efficiently compress extremely diverse types of data. Under current SBIR funding FASTMAN has developed an integrated circuit, called the FASTWAVE chip, which computes adaptive wavelet coefficients at a rate of 50 million/sec and a design for a chip set containing the FASTWAVE chip which can compute the Adapttive Wavelet Transform in real time. In this project, FASTMAN will study the feasibility of using our Adaptive Wavelet Transform to achieve high-level, high-quality compression for the diverse data types of interest in this solicitation.",

Erythromycin is the best studied example of a macrolide antibiotic; rapamycin and FK506 are promising new immunosuppressant macrolides. The price and availability of macrolides depend on their production efficiency, and therefore, on the genetics of the producing strain. Recently, university studies have shown that increasing copy-number of regulatory antibiotic genes dramatically increases the level of production of model antibiotic compounds. FermaLogic scientists are familiar with the tools required to perform analogous experiments in macrolide-producing organisms. In Phase I, we will identify and overexpress positive regulators of macrolide production. In Phase II, we will block competing metabolic pathways and negative regulators using targeted insertion mutations. Ultimately, we will create a collection of yield-improvement products and license them separately to client organizations or combine them into a single FermaLogic strain for high-level macrolide production.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Development of a Lipoprotein Analyzer system is proposed for rapid analysis of and characterization of the HDL, LDL, and VLDL profiles of human blood plasma. Preliminary results using a prototype system demonstrated the potential of the proposed system: the HDL, and VLDL fractions were clearly separated, plasma samples were analyzed without sample pre-treatment, and differences in lipoprotein profiles were noted for different patients. Analyses times were between 20 minutes and 1 hour. Determination of accurate particle size of the lipoprotein complexes also demonstrated the unique capabilities of this system. The separation strategy of the proposed Lipoprotein Analyzer is based on Flow field-flow fractionation, (Flow FFF) an elution based technique. This methodology is capable of high resolution measurements and is bio-compatible for analysis of biological macromolecules ranging from proteins up to chromosomes and cells. Thus, this instrumentation is potentially a powerful and effective tool for rapid and direct measurement of the entire subfraction set of the lipoprotein profile. The applicants propose to further study, optimize, and develop Flow FFF to ultimately generate a rugged, routine technique. They expect this development will provide a more expedient and less expensive method for lipoprotein characterization than currently available.",

Since MacCIDSS already displays temporal data over standard DMA-type maps, GFM will simply add the animation capability needed to produce the CAS. FGM will create a cartographic media type to handle the geospatial data. Temporal data is already associated with GIS data in MacCIDSS. The combination of these two elements will provide a CAS which significantly exceeds the Phase I requirements. FGM will build a generic cartographic odel CAS using object-oriented technology to ensure the CAS can be easily adapted to other applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Existing radars are very powerful and perform many functions. However, they have difficulty resolving multiple targets in the same range cell with similar doppler shifts when the targets are close in angle. Typically, targets closer than one beamwidth of the radar\\'s aperture cannot be resolved with conventional radar processing. Signal processing techniques that increase the angular resolution of radars beyond the Rayleigh resolution limit are said to provide \"superresolution\". Superresolution techniques require intense, numerical operations upon a covariance matrix. Unfortunately, conventional radars do not directly provide the covariance matrix. In this Phase I effort we propose to investigate techniques to increase conventional radar\\'s angular resolution through the use of superresolution processing as an \"applique\". The following innovative techniques are proposed for Phase I and elaborated upon in the proposal: o Indirect covariance matrix measurement o Processing only where targets have been detected o Subarraying to reduce computations and data collection Flam & Russell, Inc. has a great deal of experience implementing superresolution processing to a number of systems; direction finding, radar cross-section measurement as well as non destructive evaluation systems. Thus, we possess the right ingredients to add increased angular resolution of conventional radars in an efficient, cost-effective manner.",

This provides both a working familiarity with the posture, ant a minimal stress posture suitable for working in immersive environments for extended periods. The reclining chair is mounted on a small three degree of freedom motion platform which responds to acceleration vectors created by the VET processor. The system provides motional feedback to the occupant in synchronization with their movements inside the digital world which enhances the simulation experience.

We also propose to use MIMD parallel processing with domain decomposition to allow the solution of these large three- dimensional unsteady problems. Phase I of the proposed work will concentrate on the fluid side, and develop a numerical basis for computing fluid flow on a moving and deforming mesh. Algorithms for the transmittal of a prescribed boundary deformation to the interior unstructured mesh will be developed. The methodology will be validated against the literature. Phase II will concentrate on the discretization of the structure equations, and the computation fluid-structure interaction. Procedures for parallel processing of the code on MIMD architectures will be also implemented. The resulting software will address a wide variety of practical fluid-structure interaction problems.",

THE DEVICE UTILIZES A ROTATING TRANSVERSE MAGNETIC (TM110) CAVITY MODE TO GENERATE A SERIES OF AZIMUTHALLY DISTRIBUTED BUNCHED ELECTRON PULSES AND IS THEREFORE SIMILAR TO A \"GATLING GUN\".  EACH AZIMUTHAL ELECTRON BEAM PULSES TIME BY T/N WHERE T IS THE RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) PERIOD OF THE ROTATING MODE AND N IS THE NUMBER OF AZIMUTHAL BEAM PULSES CREATED.  THE BUNCH PULSE LENGTH IS SMALL COMPARED TO THE SEPARATION TIME T/N.  THESE ELECTRON PULSES ARE TRANSMITTED THROUGH ONE WALL OF THE CAVITY (E.G., BY A SCREEN), POST-ACCELERATED, AND FOCUSED ELECTRICALLY AND MAGNETICALLY INTO AN OUTPUT CAVITY TUNED TO AN INTEGER MULTIPLE OF THE FREQUENCY OF THE INPUT CAVITY.  AS AN EXAMPLE, FOUR AZIMUTHAL ELECTRON PULSES FROM AN INPUT CAVITY DRIVEN AT 2.5 GHZ OPERATING IN THE TM110 ROTATING MODE WERE CONSIDERED.  THE OUTPUT CAVITY WAS SELECTED AND CONFIRMED TO BE RESONANT AT 10 GHZ FOR THE TRANSVERSE MAGNETIC (TM040) MODE.  THE CONCEPT OF PRODUCING ONE HIGH-CURRENT-DENSITY AZIMUTHAL ELECTRON BUNCH HAS BEEN STUDIED EXTENSIVELY.  IN A DETAILED STUDY OF THIS PROCESS, INCLUDING SPACE CHARGE AND EMITTANCE, THE PARAMETE2RS NECESSARY TO MAKE USE OF THE PHENOMENON TO PRODUCE A MICRO-PULSED ELECTRON BEAM WERE DETERMINED.  IT WAS SHOWN FROM SELF-CONSISTENT ANALYTIC THEORY AND 2-D PARTICLE-IN-CELL SIMULATIONS THAT THE CURRENT DENSITY SCALES WITH FREQUENCY CUBED.  THIS DEVICE APPEARS TO BE CAPABLE OF HIGH CURRENTS (>KA) AND SHORT PULSES (PSEC).  APPLICATIONS FOR THIS DEVICE ARE PRIMARILY RF GENERATION IN THE 10 TO 20 GHZ REGION, AND, IN PARTICULAR, FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF LINEAR COLLIDERS.  AN RF SOURCE POINT DESIGN WAS PERFORMED UTILIZING THE GATLING MICRO-PULSE GUN.  IT APPEARS THAT AN OUTPUT RF POWER OF 100 MW AT 11.4 GHZ WITH 61 PE2RCENT SYSTEM EFFICIENCY IS ACHIEVABLE.

OMAR, currently under development as a low cost, stand alone, precision, all weather landing system for VTOL aircraft lends itself uniquely to these UAV requirements. Modifications to the exiting OMAR design will be required for this specialized UAV use but basic concepts of Luneberg lens beam shaping with angel/range processing will remain valid. Basic OMAR characteristics, including the ability to operate in a passive (covert) mode, makes it attractive as a portable 3-dimensional military IFF, positioning, tracking and command system with many commercial applications. For UAV applications, its response to authentication coded interrogation, structured in directional low-power reflective needle beams, provides a low probability of intercept and a positive identification of friend or foe (IFF) for unsophisticated, lethal and unmanned aerial vehicles. It's small, all, weather, unique operational characteristics makes it possible for OMAR to monitor more than 50 IFF targets and provide its 3-dimensional positioning information in digital form into intel networks such as the NOMAD and SAMURAI systems and/or Patriot Missile System in real time.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Current body armor polymer fibers are limited in ballistic performance by their tendency to lose axial tensile strength under the combined loading of lateral compression, lateral shear and axial tension that occurs during impact. This requires the use of heavier, bulkier, costlier body armor. The Foster-Miller team, which includes reknowned rigid-rod polymer and molecular modeling consultants, will apply computer modeling for the first time and completely redesign the ballistic fiber to address its deficiencies. We will apply a micro-mechanical model to design rigid-rod and other specialized polymers for fibers that exhibit high tensile strength (>30 gpd), high modulus (>500 gpd), higher elongation (>5 percent) and strong intermolecular interaction. Such fibers will show improved ballistic performance because of higher toughness, owing to their special polymers design. In Phase I, we will identify novel polymer designs that demonstrate the potential for achieving greater than 60 percent improvement in ballistic fiber V50 performance against 17 grain FSP's in fabric form. In Phase II, we will refine and apply the technology to prepare fibers from the best polymers for complete evaluation.

The system developed is capable of capturing fleeing, static or attacking suspects via a LOS ensnarement munition delivered from a 38mm weapon or a similar platform. The flight and capture principles have been proven in previous test programs and many of the subsystems have undergone initial optimization. A unique fuzing technique permits the munition to remain in a packaged state to avoid entanglement with intermediate objects. The streamlined profile gives the munitions range capabilities exceeding current less than lethal weapons. It also results in a stable flight pattern resulting in simplified aiming. A conservative design approach has resulted in a system that is less than lethal throughout the complete 0 to 30m range. Enhancements are suggested which can extend its range and extend the demobilization of the target. By integrating an electrical discharge system into nets construction the concept evolves into a deployable electric fence or sting net. The primary challenge is the fuzing system which activates both net deployment and the High Voltage Pulse (HVP) Taser. Development prodecures for investigating the munitions fuzing system is proposed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Field repair methods for composite aircraft structures fail to account for the unique materials, construction and failure modes associated with thick section fiberglass composite combat vehicle structures. Although acceptable repair techniques for thick laminates have been demonstrated in the laboratory, most viable techniques require the application of heat to cure an adhesive or resin. Heating blankets, hot air, heat lamps and solar radiation are field deployable, but they all rely on heat transfer from the surface through the thick, low thermal conductivity laminate. Depending on the environment, it may take many hours to effectively cure through the thickness of the laminate. Such a lengthy procedure could severely tax field maintenance assets. In or near a combat zone, time is a life or death matter. Foster-Miller proposes a practical means to drastically reduce the time required to effect high quality field repairs. Our method would combine two proven thick laminate repair methods, resin injection and through-thickness fasteners, with an ultra-rapid, simple and safe microwave heating method. We believe that this method has the potential to reduce field repair time from many hours to less than an hour. In Phase I, we will demonstrate that a man-portable microwave hood, comprised of low cost commercially available components, can be used to rapidly and safely heat repair adhesives injected into interior delamination surfaces in a fiberglass laminate. Our team member, FMC, has agreed to provide samples at no cost to the program. In Phase II, detailed repair procedures will be developed, validated, and catalogued in a field repair handbook.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         After decades of dramatic advances in optoelectronic device performance, it is clear that the implementation of fiber optic systems has been retarded by inadequate packaging technology. Commercially available packaged components often suffer from uncertain reliability, high unit cost and low functionality. Also, the intrinsic performance of the device is frequently compromised by parasitic element associated with poor packaging technology. The program described in this proposal addresses the challenges specific to optoelectronic device packaging. Foster-Miller intends to develop a new and innovative packaging concept that promises to satisfy reliability requirements, preserve device performance, and, at the same time, offer a cost-effective approach to hybrid integration. Cost reduction will be effected by, utilizing passive alignment technique for optical I/O, and an innovative liquid crystal polymer-based multichip packaging technology. Further cost reduction, at the system level, will result from the increased functionality and reliability of a multichip packaging approach. The extension of the microelectronic MCM concept to the optoelectronic MCM, or OMCM, is the core of the proposed program. Foster-Miller believes that there are compelling reasons, rooted in optimizing the mix of cost, performance and reliability, to adopt the module discipline for optoelectronic packaging. The proposed program in this Phase I effort will establish the foundation for the next generation of optoelectronic subsystems.",

To allow retrofitting the most advanced avionics conceivable, Foster-Miller also proposes conformal microchannel LFO avionics cards, an innovative card-cooling technique allowing 500 Watts heat rejection per LRM without the weight or liquid inventory of direct immersion cooling. The conformal microchannel covering will direct a flow of liquid coolant over the LRM and each electronic component on it. Space needed for the conformal microchannel at the card surface will come from space saved at the card core -- the central aluminum heat sink (or LFT channels) will be eliminated, leaving only a thin, much lighter composite stiffener. The new IAR and the LFO cards will work together to allow densely-packaged electronics upgrades to existing suites of aircraft with minimal impact on the aircraft environmental control system. A successful Phase I will demonstrate feasibility of the proposed IAR and the conformal microchannel LFO LCM. In Phase II we plan to fabricate and test a working prototype with help from Litton-Amecom and Aeroquip.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants are the leading candidate replacement refrigerants for refrigerant R-502. HFC refrigerants have no ozone depleting potential and very low global warming effect. Their thermodynamic properties and performance closely match that of R-502 so that little or no change is needed in refrigeration system components to utilize HFC refrigerants. HFC refrigerants are not \"drop-in\" replacements for R-502 because HFC's are not miscible with existing compressor lubricants. The compressor oil must be changed to a synthetic polyolester (POE) oil to prevent fouling of heat exhangers. This oil change is a costly process which makes conversion of existing refrigeration system uneconomical. The purpose of this proposed project is to correct this problem through the use of additives to improve the miscibility of HFC's with existing compressor oil. Through Solubility Parameter Theory we have identified a number of candidate substances that would serve this purpose. The proposed program will investigate these candidates through standard solubility testing methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Honeycomb sandwich structures used in aircraft are particularly susceptible to impact damage which creates a path for moisture intrusion. Moisture condensing on the exterior is forced into the core during descent causing corrosion, bondline degradation, reduced structural performance. Sandwich structures can be used in primary wing and fuselage components, if improved damage tolerant core materials are developed. Foster-Miller's truss reinforced foam core (TRFC) concept combines the strength of aluminum honeycomb with the resistance to moisture intrusion of closed cell foam. Our concept uses structural foam, reinforced with a network of small diameter truss members about 10 mils in diameter. Analysis predicts shear strength exceeding that of aluminum honeycomb. Our initial tests of this structure show that the truss network dramatically improves the load capacity of the foam sandwich with minimal increase in weight. TRFC sandwich panels are made using Foster-Miller's proprietary z-fiber process. This proven process can be used to produce the desired structures during a standard autoclave cure cycle. Its use will permit fabrication cost reductions relative to honeycomb since it eliminates machining of the honeycomb and secondary bonding of the facesheets. Lockheed will assist in Phase I to insure approaches developed are relevant to future aircraft and integrate with their Robost Composites Structures proposal.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The ideal aeroengine bearing will provide adequate performance without need for active cooling or lubrication. Foster-Miller's concept for an advanced aeroengine bearing uses ceramic races and rolling elements along with a self-contained, solid lubricating \"composite\" ball cage. The key innovation in this bearing concept is the cage element. It can simultaneously meet bearing cage requirements of light weight, high 1500 degrees F strength, and lubricity over -60 to 1500 degrees F. During the Phase I effort, Foster-Miller will conclusively prove the feasibility of this novel bearing cage concept and demonstrate a net shape process to cost effectively fabricate such bearing cages. Cage material specimens will be subjected to relevant friction/wear and strength tests at temperatures up to 1,500 degrees F. During the Phase I option, a representative bearing cage component will be fabricated to net shape, and performance benefits offered by this technologywill be quantified. The Phase I team consists of two recognized experts on solid lubricants and ceramic bearings-Bobby McConnell and Jim Hanoosh. Additionally, the Phase I includes two commercialization partners-NTN Bearings, a bearing manufacturer, and Textron Lycoming, an aeroengine manufacturer and a bearing user, to ensure \"commericializable\" technology that is relevant to aeroengine bearing needs.",

Based on techniques derived from computed tomography, SMT can image interior components of turbine engines while they are hot, running, and under load. SMT is based on physical components and reconstructive algorithms that have been previously developed for other purposes on other programs, mostly under Air Force sponsorship. No new hardware is requiested, only an assembly of existing components and subsystems. In Phase I, Foster-Miller joins with Lockheed, Pratt & Whitney, Boeing and others to present a program that performs an experimental demonstration of the SMT technique to establish performance, that sets requirements and that provides a conceptual design for a full-up SMT system. Quantitative image data from the SMT system can be overlaid with other nondestructive testing and diagnostic data on the IHPTET knowledge template. The Phase I program establishes a cost-benefit plan for the SMT system and a strategy for identifying users. In Phase II we would build and demonstrate a prototype SMT. This prototype system would be essential to the commercialization of SMT through further demonstration and applications development.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Full Circle Research, Inc. proposed a program to develop a package for microelectronic integrated circuits which will shield these devices against the deleterious effects of space radiation. Such a package would permit spacecraft designers to use commercial ICs in applications where, previously, only more expensive military technology radiation hardened chips could be used. Previous attempts to develop such packages have assumed a wartime environment in which the radiation belts surrounding the earth would have been \"pumped up\" by exoatmospheric nuclear bursts, resulting in electron spectra much harder than the natural radiation environment. Also, secondary radiation generated by nuclear interactions between protons and the shield material was neglected. These conditions, in addition to the changes in IC vulnerability to space radiation brought about by the advance in IC technology since the original work was done, combine to make the earlier shielded packages obsolete. The program proposed herein will, during Phase I, use recent advanced on space radiation effects on micro-electronics to modify the design equations for package-level shielding, and develop new package designs using these modified equations. Then, during Phase II, prototypes implementing these designs will be fabricated and tested to demonstrate their ability to shield against ionizing radiation without increasing to an unacceptable extent single event upsets caused by cosmic rays and Van Allen belt radiation. Finally, during Phase III, production of these packages will begin, aimed at use in commercial satellite systems such as IRIDIUM.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The high front surface recombination velocity (SRV) exhibited by indium phosphide (InP) solar cells has limited the level of efficiency that has been demonstrated to date. Gallia has developed metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) methodology to enable the growth of a previously unknown wide band gap (4 eV) cubic-phase of gallium sulfide (GaS), which has been demonstrated to passivate III-V surfaces. Gallia's sulfide based coating will provide a proccessable method for the passivation of InP solar cell surfaces. The project objectives include: growth of high purity GaS films on InP, determination of the extent of surface passivation, fabrication and testing of GaS passivated InP solar cells, determination of GaS long term stability, and development of alternative III-VI passivation materials. Gallia will commit 900 man hours to these objectives. It is anticipated that the as a result of this program Gallia will be able to fabricate, by MOCVD, a series of gallium chalcogenide-based passivation coatings for InP solar cells. It is expected that the results of this project will benefit NASA in the possible fabrication of high efficiency InP solar cells for non-terrestrial applications.",

Phase I will result in an analysis of the UCF approach and of more conventional approaches. These analyses will include the effects of interaction with various image generating devices. In addition to reports, this project will generate simple prototype exhibits of the most promising optical concept. Phase II will take the optical design determined to be optimal during Phase I and produce a working display prototype. This prototype will be capable of operating with both computer and video inputs.

Literature supports that our diabetic, fatty male rat as superior to other available rat models in the onset and level of diabetes expressed. Characteristics such as pancreatic insulin release and muscle insulin resistance appear to mimic the human condition. Significant growth in the use of the male (ZDF/Gmi, fa/fa) by researchers has occurred since the model's commercial availability. Preliminary experimentation lead us to believe, that through manipulation of diet, NIDDM can be produced in the ZDF/Gmi female. Currently, there is no reliable type II female model available for comparative study. Considering that the ZDF/Gmi female has not historically expressed NIDDM, and the preliminary data shows that these same females have expressed high glucose levels through carbohydrate stimulation, it is believed that a female NIDDM model can be created. Through experimental dietary manipulation the research team believes both the degree and the timing of onset of NIDDM in this model can be made both reliable and variable. Based upon current input from the researchers utilizing the male model, the creation of the female would be well received.",

Parallel segmented synthesis will operate at cycle times of 30 minutes for simultaneous addition of 16 amino acids and up to 16 synthesis stacks, and both will be comprised of 1 to 8 synthesis wafers. Each wafer may contain a polypeptide of completely independent sequence. There is an anticipated decrease of 30% in reagent consumption. The machine will reduce synthesis costs to less than $5 per amino acid. This instrument will enable the production of peptide libraries at low cost for applications requiring hundreds or thousands of peptides. Phase I will allow the creation of one semi-automated peptide synthesizer and the software to drive it. Automation will first be applied to the solvent delivery system and then to the entire process. Availability of hundreds of peptides in this manner will significantly reduce the cost and time of research into biological activity screening, mutagenesis, structural studies, etc.",

THIS ENTIRE METHOD HINGES ON THE PROPER COLLECTION OF SOIL SAMPLES TO REFLECT THE VARIATION IN NUTRIENT STATUS OF AN AREA REQUIRING FERTILIZATION. WHILE THE BULK OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE HAS OCCURRED IN APPLICATION EQUIPMENT, THE METHOD OF SOIL SAMPLING HAS NOT KEPT PACE. INNOVATIVE SOIL SAMPLE COLLECTION DEVICES ARE REQUIRED THAT SPEED UP SOIL SAMPLE COLLECTION PROCESS TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT. A NEW SOIL SAMPLING DEVICE HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO SATISFY THESE REQUIREMENTS. IT CAN BE MOUNTED ON THE FRONT OF A FOUR WHEEL, ALL TERRAIN VEHICLE AND DOES NOT REQUIRE OPERATOR DISMOUNT TO PROCESS THE COLLECTED SOIL SAMPLES. A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS WERE DESIGNED BY THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR TO TEST THE FEASIBLITY OF THIS NEW SOIL SAMPLER. AS RESEARCH DIRECTOR OF GEOPHYTA, THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR IS WELL QUALIFIED TO CONDUCT THIS DESIGN AND TESTING PROJECT.",

Giner, Inc. proposes development of a solid-ionomer electrochemical capacitor having a unit cell capacitance greater than 2 F/cm2 and a repeating element thickness of 6 mils or less. This capacitor could provide high current pulses for electromechanical actuation (EMA). Primary project objectives are to develop high-capacitance particulates, to increase capacitor gravimetric and volumetric energy densities above baseline, and to fabricate a 25 V, 250 watt capacitor with a repeating element thickness of 6 mils or less. Specific EMA applications will be identified and capacitor weight and volume projections made.",

Over the past two decades, models and databases of increasing computational accuracy and sophistication have been developed for depicting environmental impact. In many situations however, input data reliability, not model sophistication, has been the limiting factor in the overall accuracy and defensibility of the end product. This study investigates the feasibility of automatically accessing digitally encoded data from the Air Force's air traffic control Programmable Indicator Data Processor (PIDP) and using this data to develop input to the DoD NOISEMAP/BASEOPS computer programs. Objectives of the project are (1) to assess and document hardware options for extracting data from the PIDP system and to determine the preliminary requirements for an automated, on-site data extraction and storage system, (2) to assess the feasibility of developing a sufficiently sized database to accurately determine annual average values of data parameters (such as flight corridors, altitude and speed profiles, numbers of operations, runway and corridor use), and (3) to assess the feasibility of developing a computer-based, interactive system for generating NOISEMAP/BASEOPS input parameters directly from this database in a consistent and repeatable fashion.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Since 1982, individuals over age 50 have represented a near constant 10% of total reported AIDS cases in the United States. Middle-aged and older Americans are being affected by the AIDS epidemic in various ways: as patients, care providers, family members, friends, neighbors, consumers, and as citizens. While knowledge of AIDS has been increasing in the general population, several studies have shown that individuals age 50 and over, and especially those over 64 are more likely than younger persons not to know, or to be unsure, about associating with persons who have AIDS and are less likely to perceive themselves at risk. While numerous education programs have been implemented for various high-risk groups in the United States, little effort has been made to reach older adults in spite of the need. We will develop a low-cost, comprehensive education program that will be made commercially available to organizations and agencies that service adults age 50 and over. The project will be guided by the most current information and developments in AIDS research. Phase I activities include 1) developing a model education curriculum that includes a leader's guide and a participant's manual, 2) designing a Phase II research project to evaluate and refine the program, and 3) identifying a potential site where the program will be tested during Phase II.",

Current research suggests that in the next decadeten thousand or more special care units (SCUs) and day care programs will be established withtherapeutic design features that are intended to better support these residents. This project will developa system of design criteria and tools that care settings, including homes, adult day health centers,residential care and nursing care facilities, can use to create therapeutic environments for suchindividuals. Specifically, the project will test and modify the therapeutic efficacy of a set of designcriteria that the principal investigators developed over the last two years through a literature review andexpert consensus process. The project will produce a manual and computerized data collection formswhich can be customized by each user so that they can complete a post-occupancy evaluation anddesign process for a therapeutic care environment. Families, facilities, and design professionals canpurchase this system to evaluate existing, or to renovate or create new therapeutic environments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Orthotopic liver transplantation is an effective and increasingly popular therapy for a variety of liver diseases, but there is as yet no method for temporarily sustaining a patient awaiting transplant who enters into hepatic failure. C3A is a human liver cell line derived from an hepatoblastoma that retains most of the characteristics of the human hepatocyte. We have cultured these cells in hollow fiber devices and shown that they are capable of carrying out many of the major liver-specific metabolic interconversions. We have successfully tested this device in an animal model of fulminant hepatic failure and in four human subjects. In preparation for a multisite trial of this device, we will undertake a feasibility study of five patients gathered from the affiliated hospitals of the Baylor College of Medicine and at the Hermann Hospital, Univ. of Texas School of Medicine. The use of liver transplantation is limited by both the availability of organs and financial constraints. An ELAD should have application in a number of transplant situations. First, it will allow patients in fulminant hepatic failure to be stabilized and calmly evaluated before operating. Second, it will find use in stabilizing and assisting patients after transplant, particularly in situations in which the graft fails on reperfusion. Third, in some instances, it may serve as a substitute for transplant. This device would allow time for the patient's natural liver to regenerate, sparing the expense of operation, the lifelong dependence on immunosuppression and the likelihood of premature mortality.",

Although significant strides have been made in the development of usable and effective human computer interfaces (HCI), most of the effort has been focused on tools for use by designers that specify how the user will provide information to the computer, e.g., input dialogues. To provide the capabilities needed for dynamic and complex real-world applications, a tool that can be employed by the user to specify the identification and presentation of information is needed. The key focus of UTIDS is that only by empowering the user to specify and design the needed visualization and integration capabilities can the real-world complexity of the user tasks be managed and optimized.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor (Meg-CSF) is a lineage specific factor that specifically regulates the proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes from bone marrow. Meg-CSF is of significant importance in the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to diseases of a variety of etiologies, or due to chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. In the past, tremendous efforts have been made around the world to purify and eventually to molecularly clone this hematopoietic growth factor. However, purification of Meg-CSF has been aborted or hampered largely because of the lack of a quick, sensitive and reliable assay. This Phase I grant will develop a molecular assay for Meg-CSF using a newly-established megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line HIMeg. Preliminary studies have shown that this cell line, treated with vitamin D3 (VD3) or cis-retinoic acid (cis-RA), is able to differentiate into more mature megakaryocytes. Specifically, we will determine (i) if VD3 or cis-RA-induced differentiation is associated with up regulation of megakaryocyte/platelet gene expression and (ii) if functionally purified Meg-CSF induces megakaryocytic differentiation of HIMeg cells. The overall goal is to utilize the unique cell line to discover novel and effective factors/drugs for treatment of thrombocytopenia and megakaryoblastic leukemia.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The present trend in the packaging of advanced integrated circuit chip is toward various types of multi-chip modules (MCM). Of these, MCM-D employing film deposition is the one most capable of supporting hich system performance. This proposal considers MCM-D as the basis for implementing a variety of thin-film layers which could integrate digital and analog functions into a single miniaturized system package. These layers might be conductive or superconductive, magnetic or ferro-electric, as well as dielectric insulating layers, deposited in a multilayer process. Having defined the material choices from general system requirements, the optimization of the system is then achieved by optimizing the performance ofthe components and assuring compatible communication between them. Voltage levels of operating temperatures are key adjustable variables for the system. The trend for CMOS fabrication is toward the continuing reduction of IC feature size. Toward this end, voltage reduction and the accompanying reduced theral dissipation must be primary objectives. It is clear that these objectives can be achieved by lowering operating temperatures. The Phase I effort would examine a specific system of military interest - a microwave receiver, to assess the application of these principles to produce a conceptual optimization of the packaged system, namely, a cryocooler. Anticipated Benefits: All commercial high-performance electronics which comprise of digital and analog functions will benefit from this development. Work stations and higher level computers would have thier central processing boards replaced by optimized cryoelectronic MCM-Ds, since a small refrigerator could easily be made as part of the chassis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         To prevent fratercides in today's congested battlefield, there is a critical need for positive methods of identifying friend-or-foe. The Army initiative for the Battlefield Combat Identification System (BCIS) addresses the need for pre-launch IFF. With deployment of smart muntions and long-range guns, there is an increasing need to provide post-launch IFF capabilities on-board munitions. This proposal describes an advanced concept of identifying co-operative targets capable of both pre-launch and post-launch applications. The proposed concept is based on the use of low-cost miniature microwave transponder (i.e. ID tag) that can be interrogated from the firng position and/or from munitions in flight. Both the transponder and the interrogator will be build in MMIC chips for low cost and small size. The proposed interrogation and response system, with electronically programmed encryption, is immune to jamming, decoding, or false target detection. The interrogator function on munitions may be built into a transmitter available on board. The interrogator may be integrated with the proximity fuze available on board. The interrogator may be integrated with the proximity fuze transmitter, for example, for pre-fuzing or dudding when a friendly target is detected. The transponder, built in a miniature pakcage using MMIC chips, can be ahnd-carried or mounted on any combat vehicle.",

Gallium-arsenide converter chips are made possible by the development of K and Ka-band balanced MMIC mixers with high LO isolation from RF and IF ports and high spurious harmonic suppresion that allow integration of the mixer with other converter functions (e.g. amplifiers and filters) onto a single chip. The Hittite balanced mixer design approach is based on a novel method of implementing passive baluns and transformers on chip at high frequencies. A 12 to 18 GHz MMIC mixer utilizing this design approach has achieved low conversion loss, high isolations, DC to 6 GHz IF bandwidth, 25 dBm 3rd order (input) intercept point and typical RF circuit yields of 80%. A design for higher frequency, 20 to 40 GHz mixers will be developed using this new mixer topology and advanced design technologies, PHEMT, HBT as well as MESFET.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The GPS position data may be used effectively for guidance and tracking of munitions. Along with this advancement in the GPS-based guidance technology, advent of low-cost hand-held terminals for personal and data comunications offers the prospect of mid-course correction of munitions in flight from a ground-based control station. Low-cost implementation of both the GPS receiver and guidance data link is made possible as high-scale integration of microwave circuit functions on GaAs chips becomes an established practice. Hittite Microwave Corporation has pioneered in the development of highly integrated microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) chips for proximity fuzes, GPS frequency translators and command receivers for gun-fired munitions subjected to high-G setback force. In addition to MMIC designs, Hittite has developed a novel concept for implementing IFF functions on munitions using guidance and/or fuze transmitters. These MMIC-based system concepts may be cabined to implement a method of terminal guidance of munitions in flight by a man-portable (hand-carried) telemetry transmitter coded with target position data. This function may be integrated with the fuze and IFF systems on board the munition for precision fuzing and prevention of fratercide. The proposed system concept relies on the GPS translator on- board for location and tracking of the munition, correction of impact position by means of the position data transmitted from the ground via a telemetry link, and the fuze transmitter for IFF and detonation. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - The proposed program will produce a large number of by-products with potential applications in commercial sectors. The data-link portion of the proposed system, for example, will be directly applicable to spread spectrum communications in the 2.4 GHz band. The ID system will find applications in security/surveillance systems.",

To be successful, the PIO prediction method must: be accepted as valid by the manufacturers and government flight test organizations; account for all of the factors that contribute to PIO; be in a form that can be used for design guidance; and be easily calculated from flight test data. In the proposed Phase I effort, a candidate set of unified PIO criteria will be assembled following a thorough review of PIOs and their contributing factors and establishment of a database for criteria evaluations. A series of one-on-one information-gathering meetings is proposed with key members of industry and government to identify the consensus of opinion concerning PIO causes and the status of prediction criteria.

Lithium niobate crystals have been extensively characterized as a storage media and it is readily available commercially. The key innovation of the proposed system is the incorporation of the dynamic copying method with the 3-D holographic disk which compensates for the erasure of the stored holograms while they are read out. The specifications of the proposed 3-D disk are: terabyte capacity per disk, read/write capability, recording rate in excess of 50 Mb/second, readout rate of 250 Mb/sec, and access time estimated to be approximately 20 milliseconds. The proposed system yields very high storage density at approximately 113 bits per micron squared. The first phase of the proposed effort intends to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system. The phase I work plan includes the optimization of the copying schedule, the incorporation of error correcting capability into the system, the studying of alignment sensitivity issues, and the design of the 3-D disk prototype.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Presently, many small and medium sized payload modules are secured in place with #10 screws. Unfortunately, these screws cross thread easily and require epoxy to survive launch, rendering small and medium payloads as non-candidates for on-orbit servicing. An innovative fastener for payloads is proposed, as an alternative to #10 screws, to facilitate telerobotic & EVA astronaut on-orbit servicing. The proposed fastener is tolerant of initial misalignments yet cannot crossthread; also no lock down epoxy is required to survive the launch environment. The objectives of the research are to confirm the predicated performance of the innovation, determine the practical feasibility of the fastener and to investigate the space qualification potential of the innovation. The proposed effort is to design and fabricate, working prototypes of the proposed fastener and to fabricate and test a comprehensive breadboard version of a small payload module for testing robotic and manual change-out of said module. The offerer expects the Phase I effort will lead to the production of the proposed fastener which in turn will foster the development and production of serviceable small and medium payload modules. The fastener development will also hasten the introduction of a comprehensive \"fastening\" strategy for telerobotic and EVA on-orbit servicing.",

Hood wishes to exploit the best features of passive approaches: 1. The capability to generate the control forces passively, through reactive storage of energy for a half cycle. 2. The absolute stability. 3. The low power consumption. Hood wishes to maintain as much as possible the best features of fully active approaches: 1. The ability to adapt. 2. The ability to respond to distant performance measures, and to globally coordinate the actuators. Hood believes that an adaptive-passive approach, in which the reactive control element or array of elements respond passively but are adaptively tuned by a distributed active supervisory system, offers the best combination for these problems. Hood anticipates suffering a marginal performance sacrifice compared to a fully active approach, but enjoying a major reduction in system complexity, increased reliability, and a decrease in cost.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Montreal protocol banning halon production after 1995 has motivated the Air Force to actively seek replacements for halocarbon fire extinguishers. Currently proposed drop-in replacements such as HCFC's and CF3I have carbon-halogen bonds and are thus vulnerable to the same environmental concerns as is CF3Br (Halon 1301). While bromine atoms are very effective at catalytically poisoning the chain reactions of combustion, it is not essential to deliver Br to a flame as a halocarbon. A Phase I SBIR program is proposed to explore halon substitutes based on labile Br in a proprietary material that meets Air Force requirements for thermal stability, toxicity, and extinguishing capability per unit mass and volume. The proposed species is water soluble. Both it and its combustion products are unstable against tropospheric oxidation and thus have neither ozone depletion potential nor global warming potential. Theoretical analyses will include computational fluid dynamics and thermochemical kinetics at an appropriate level for wide area and aircraft engine fires. The thermal and oxidative decomposition products of the material will be calculated using quantum electronic structure methods and will be compared with pyrolytic and oxidation experiments. An engineering experiment will add calibrated flows of existing and proposed extinguishing materials to a 100,000 Btu/hr turbine fuel flame. The flame's response will be diagnosed by optical and infrared emission to rank existing and new extinguishing materials. The ranking developed from the small-scale experiment will be compared to the results of more elaborate, published studies of current extinguishers, including Halon 1301, hydro-fluorocarbons, trifluoromethyliodide, water and sodium bicarbonate.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Huntsville Sciences Corporation (HSC) proposes to develop a new and innovative approach for predicting the pore pressures and structural behavior of a thermochemically decomposing composite ablator material like those commonly used to insulate rocket nozzles. The proposed method uses a two-dimensional (2-D) finite element solver with adaptive grid features in solving a modified form of the energy and mass continuity equations proposed by Weiler[1] which describe the thermochemical ablation process. The adaptive grid features of the proposed method will permit the accurate resolution of the large pressure gradients that exist at the pyrolysis zone / virgin material interface which currently pose resolution problems with other finite element and finite difference techniques. The proposed method is 2-D. It accounts for the spatial variation in material properties ,i.e. thermal capacitance, thermal conductivity, and porosity in computing the temperatures and pore pressures in the ablating material. The Phase I code will accurately track the surface recession and the char and pyrolysis zone formations that occur during the ablation process. The planned Phase II enhancements include (a) modifications to the Phase I code to solve the complete energy and mass continuity governing equations, (b) the addition of chemical kinetics, (c) the addition of a two-phase water vapor/condensation model, and (d) developing efficient interfaces to codes like ACE [4] and MEIT [5] which produce the surface input data for this model . With the Phase II code enhancements, this code will be used to accurately predict ply separation in thermochemically decomposing rocket nozzle liners which is a problem of prime interest to NASA.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Fast Fourier transformers (FFFs) are used extensively in military and commercial applications. There is a constant demand for faster and more accurate FFTS. RNS (Residue Number System) based FFTs are candidates to provide these improvements, however techniques for efficient implementation of RNS operations must first be developed. RNS operations will be develope in the proposed Phase I research that will lead to RNS-based hardware designs with significan improvements in both speed and accuracy. The Phase I research will provide the conceptual are preliminary designs of the RNS-based FFT. The most promising designs will be selected an compared in terms of estimated performance versus cost. This will be accomplished by developing a computer simulation to evaluate the candidates for selected moduli. In Phase II the preliminary design will be refined and a hardware processor fabricated. The RNS-based FFT will be evaluated in terms of speed and accuracy and compared, based on performance and cost, to current FFT processors used in military and commercial applications. The technology developed in Phase I and implemented in Phase II will lead to enhanced performance of sensors in future weapons systems. Further , commercial applications that require intensive data analysis a processing will benefit from this research. Anticipated Benefits: FFTs have a variety of uses in both military and commercial applications which can benefit from RNS-based FFT processors. The most common military application is radar signal processing. Commercial applications which require intensive analysis of test data in the structural, fluid flow, and thermal areas such as aircraft and automobile engine testing will benefit from this technology. Weather forecasting and seismic modeling of earthquakes which record and process large data bases can effectively use this technology.",

Firstly, it requires less capital investment and NRE costs. Secondly, the process itself is far less complicated. Thirdy, it may be more reliable than the solder bump process. The siginificant advantage of this epoxy flip chip technology is its affordability for production implementation for small companies. This should make MCM manufacturing available to a broader community. The feasibility and reliability of this process will be investigated by developing an application process and hardware for optimum epoxy bump geometries, evaluating commercially available robotic systems for final assembly, and testing a specailly designed package that will include a silicon test chip and PGA ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: After the successful development of an epoxy flip chip, potential applications would be a cost effective replavement for solder bump flip chips used in MCM. Other applications may include interconnects for back side illuminated detectors for primarily military applications.",

There are two known methods that have been proposed for the in-air measurement of body volumeprincipally for infants. One is based on air displacement and the intrinsic relationship between gas volume and pressure. Another method, using the Helmholtz resonator principal with excitation from a loud-speaker, has also been proposed for infants. Both methods are complex and highly sensitive to temperature. The new device also uses acoustic resonance principles, but eliminates problems related to temperature or humidity changes. It is expected that very accurate measurements can be made in much less than a minute with readout in body density and estimated percent body fat. The device should be inexpensive and a product desired and eventually required by most physicians. Specific aims of Phase I would include design and construction of a breadboard acoustic volume device to measure the volume of adults and optimize the system by measuring a range of known volumes of water. Some preliminary studies would also be conducted with some human volunteers.",

RECENT HOVER TESTS OF THE LEAP KINETIC KILL VEHICLE HAS SUCCESSFULLY DEMONTRATED THE POTENTIAL OF LOW-DENSITY, OXIDATION-RESISTANT CARBON/CARBON (C/C) COMPOSITES FOR DIVERT THRUST CHAMBER (THRUSTER) APPLICATIONS.

CONVENTIONAL, ISOTHERMAL/ISOBARIC CVI TECHNIQUES REQUIRE INTENTIONALLY SLOW DEPOSITION RATES IN ORDER TO UNIFORMLY INFILTRATE AND DENSIFY THE FIBROUS PREFORMS WHILE MINIMIZING THROUGH-THE-THICKNESS DENSITY GRADIENTS. THESE SLOW CVI DENSIFICATION PROCESSES ROUTINELY REQUIRE 300-600 HOURS TO COMPLETE, RESULTING IN VERY LONG PRODUCT LEAD TIMES AND THUS RELATIVELY HIGH PRODUCT COST. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I PROGRAM IS TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE AN INNOVATIVE FORCED FLOW CVI PROCESS FOR THE RAPID DENSIFICATION OF C/C COMPOSITE DIVERT THRUSTERS. THE GOAL OF THIS DEVELOPMENT IS TO SUCCESSFULLY REDUCE THE DENSIFICATION CYCLE BY AT LEAST 75%, RESULTING IN A COMPOSITE THRUSTER FABRICATION COST REDUCE OF OVER 50%.

The observation of broadband emitters, such as cosmic dust clouds and proto-planetary objects, requires a large instantaneous bandwidth for analysis of multiple spectral lines. For these observations a sample rate of 10GS/s is desired. The 10GS/s ADC is constructed from three comparators and digital logic. HYPRES proposes to design, fabricate, and test an innovative comparator design based on Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs). SQUIDS have demonstrated the energy resolution required for 2K noise thresholds at 5GHz bandwidths. The complete ADC will be fabricated using niobium which operates at 4K, is compact (1mm x 1mm), and low power ( < 1mW) making it suitable for space-based imaging arrays requiring an ADC per pixel. HYPRES has developed superconducting digital logic which can be used to crosscorrelate the ADC data at 10GS/s. The design would the follow the ADC with a 1 to N demultiplexor, this will produce N output ports at l/N of the sample rate, each port is connected to a semiconductor correlator. A second approach would implement a superconducting correlator operating at 10GS/s.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) are extremely sensitive detectors of magnetic flux and can be used as low noise amplifiers for many applications such as cryogenic detectors and biomagnetic measurements. In order to utilize a SQUID as an amplifier, extensive peripheral electronics are required. Such room temperature electronics are very expensive, specially for space-qualified applications, and are responsible for a substantial portion of the cost of the commercial magnetometer systems. Therefore, it is highly advantageous to simplify the electronics required to operate SQUIDs. This project will lead to the development of an all thin-film SQUID array amplifier chip. The proposed DC SQUID amplifier integrates several (on the order of a hundred) DC SQUID gates with a high sensitivity analog SQUID magnetometer. Each chip, in addition to having a SQUID array coupled to an analog SQUID, will also have an integrated superconducting transformer to facilitate its interface to an external pick up coil. This scheme will eliminate the need for the most critical part of the peripheral electronics, that is, the low noise amplifiers, which, in practical systems, determines the noise floor of the systems. Such a system will be compact and cost effective, and requires ordinary support electronics. As a result of this effort, it will be possible to design and fabricate SQUID chips that will contain arrays of such SQUIDs for integration in magnetometer systems, thereby reducing the complexity of the room temperature electronics for such systems. Due to significant progress in superconducting electronics at HYPRES in recent months, we are actually proposing to design, fabricate and evaluate these SQUID array amplifier chips under this phase I program. The goal for the flux noise for such chips is less than 5XlO-6~o/~Hz when operated from 4.2 K down to milliKelvins.",

The proposed instrument feasibility will be demonstrated by building a working prototype and performing microindentation and microscratch tests on DLC thin films and other materials for comparison of results with published data and similar tests performed with the IBM microindenter. These tests will determine the instrument's resolution in the applied load and displacement measurements, and its ability to correlate micromechanical properties with experimentally measured micromechanical failures. Successful completion of this program would result in components that can be used with a standard STM to perform microindentation and microscratch testing on a wide range of materials, with the ability to image the surface in situ before and after testing. These components are expected to provide a force resolution in both the normal and transverse directions of 100nN, with a full scale range of 10mN, and displacement resolution of 1nm (10 degrees A).",

FLASHBOARD PLASMA SOURCES ARE WIDELY USED AS PLASMA INJECTORS IN THESE POS'S. THE FLASHBOARD PLASMA IS PRODUCED BY SURFACE BREAKDOWN ON AN INSULATOR IN VACUUM. SINCE THE SURFACE CONDITIONS DEPEND ON THE PREVIOUS HISTORY, THE RESULTING PLASMA IS NOT UNIFORM, REPORDUCIBLE OR OF HIGH PURITY. A GAS BREAKDOWN PLASMA SOURCE IS PROPOSED TO REPLACE FLASHBOARD SOURCES. THIS SOURCE IS A VARIATION ON THE COAXIAL PLASMA GUN INVESTIGATED IN THE EARLY 1060'S FOR FUSION APPLICATIONS. THE PLASMA GUN CONSITS OF TWO CONCENTRIC ELECTRODES FILLED WITH GAS FROM A PUFF VALVE PRIOR TO APPLICATION OF A VOLTAGE PULSE FROM A CAPACITOR BANK. THE PLASMA IS ACCELERATED OUT OF THE GUN BY THE J X B FORCES ACTING ON THE CURRENT SHEET THAT FIRST FORMS ON THE INSULATOR WHEN THE GAS BREAKS DOWN. THE GUN PRODUCES PLASMAS DENSITIES OF 10 13TH TO 10 15TH/CM3 AT VELOCITIES OF 10 CM/US WHICH AE IN THE RANGE REQUIRED FOR POS APPLICATIONS. FURTHERMORE, A REPRODUCTIBLE GAS PUFF INSURES A REPRODUCIBLE PLASMA WITH LITTLE CONTAIMINATION FROM THE ELECTRODES OR INSULATOR. THE PULSE POWER DESIGNER CAN ACHIEVE A WIDE RANGE OF PLASMA CONDITIONS BY VARYING THE PLENUM PRESSURE, TIME DELAY BETWEEN ENERGIZING THE PUFF VALVE AND CAPACITOR BANK, THE CAPACITOR VOLTAGE, AND THE GAS SPECIE. COMPARABLE CONTROL WITH FLASHBOARDS WOULD REQUIRE VARYING THE NUMBER OF FLASHBOARDS WITH VIRTUALLY NO CONTROL OF PLASMA SPECIE.

        "abstract": "Abstract         We will develop and validate a fiber optic sensor for measuring lead in blood which can measure 1-100 micro g/dL concentrations of lead in blood using an innovative Lead Ion Selective Fiber Optode (LISFO) technology. The sensor will require a blood volume less than 200 micro L and will be capable of repeated sample analysis every 3 minutes. It will operate with an accuracy and a precision of 5-10% or better when measuring 10 micro g/dL lead concentrations. This will make the instrument suitable for lead screening programs under the new CDC guideline of 10 micro g/d. Use of fiber optic technology will provide a rugged, compact portable instrument and will allow low cost screenings of blood lead concentrations to be performed. Sample preparation will be automated so that minimally trained operators can achieve reliable results with minimal opportunity for sample contamination. The electronic output from the device will be designed to interface with a PC so that an entered patient ID will be printed together with the test results. The sensor will utilize elements which have been individually validated in other systems, but which have heretofore not been combined.",

Our concept utilizes a collector leaf (of finger brush) to deliver a film of liquid metal to the slipring surface. The proposed system has active collector actuation which helps maintain a stable film through improved slipring tracking. Our collector concept is aimed at improving serviceability while maintaining electrical performance. Multiple collector modules mounted to the return conductor form a collector ring. Each module consists of three parts; a manifold, a collector leaves assembly, and a guide block. Collector maintenance (if required) will involve only the replacement of the collector leaves assembly. Our Phase I effort will result in concept level drawings of the liquid metal current collector system needed for Navy homopolar ship drives. We will develop the tools needed to make knowledgeable design decisions. We will use these tools to perform a concept design of the ship drive collectors. In Phase II, we will continue collector development through testing at IAP Research, Inc. and the David Taylor Research Center.",

Sensitivity and spectral resolution increase with increasing strength of the spectrometer's magnetic field, thereby, enabling the study of ever decreasing sample volumes or concentrations and providing increased resolution for the study of increasingly complex systems. \"Low-temperature\" superconducting windings used in current NMR spectrometer magnets have critical fields which limit field strengths to <20 Tesla. Newer \"high-temperature\" superconductors (HTS have higher critical fields (up to 200) and, thus, potentially can be used to generate magnetic field strengths heretofore unattainable.In this program, a set of HTS \"double pancake\" coils will be fabricated and tested by Intermagnetics General Corporation, in collaboration with the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, to provide the foundation for Phase II development of an HTS magnet coil. This Phase II coil will authenticate the conductor and coil technology required to fabricate a coil insert system which will boost the field of a future 20 Tesla spectrometer by up to 5 Tesla. The resulting 25 Tesla magnetic field (corresponding to a proton resonance frequency of 1.06 GHz) is beyond that achievable using low temperature superconductors.",

THE SO-CALLED INTERNAL TIN APPROACH WHICH HAS BEEN THE CHOICE OF US INDUSTRY, HAS EMERGED IN MANY FORMS; EACH WITH A NOVELTY TO ADDRESS ONE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CONDUCTOR OR ANOTHER.  THE GENERAL APPROACH ITSELF INVOLVES THE MANUFACTURE OF TWO MAJOR COMPONENTS - 1) A COMPOSITE ELEMENT AND 2) A STABILIZER TUBE.  THE LATTER PROVIDES RELATIVELY LARGE AMOUNTS OF COPPER DESIRABLE IN THE WIRE TO ADD STABILITY AND PROTECTION TO THE FINAL SUPERCONDUCTING DEVICE.  IT HAS TO INCORPORATE DIFFUSION BARRIERS SUCH AS NB, TA, OR V TO KEEP THE TIN FROM POLLUTING THE COPPER DURING FINAL HEAT TREATMENT.  IN CASES OF PULSED FIELD APPLICATIONS, IT SHOULD NOT REACT WITH TIN FORMING A CONTINUOUS A15 SUPERCONDUCTING LAYER.  THE PRESENT METHOD OF MAKING THE STABILIZER MEMBER IS BY TUBULAR HOT EXTRUSION.  THE GEOMETRY AND DUCTILITY CONSTRAINTS PLACED ON THE DIFFUSION BARRIER MATRIAL ARE SO DEMANDING THAT OVER THE YEARS THE STABILIZER MANUFACTURING PROCESS HAS BECOME A VERY EXPENSIVE AND TEDIOUS ONE.  IN ORDER TO LIMIT TOTAL STRAIN FROM BILLET TO FINAL WIRE, THE STABILIZER BILLET DIAMETER AND THE RESTACK BUNDLE SIZE HAVE BEEN REDUCED RAISING THE COST MATERIALS.

These exists a significant need for alternative, environmentallyclan sources of electical energy that are suitable for mobile nad remote site use. In particular, cost effective, reliable and efficient power sources are needed for electric vehicles. For this type of application, it is essential that the power source possess high energy density and that it be efficiently manufactured.

Data from other government agencies will include that in TABILS and at HDL, MICOM, and AATD. A Phase II plan will be produced for training and testing three ATR algorithms not heretofore considered for tank-mounted applications but proven in related contexts: 1. An adaptive Bayesian statistical classifier, which in its operational implementation would be continually retrained upon the actual ground clutter within which the tank is operating. 2. A \"genetic\" algorithm, which uses the same feature sets as #1, but evolves a different polynomial discriminant function. Both the \"genetic\" and \"adaptive\" classifier algorithms are under development for the LONGBOW MMW radar by Systems Dynamics, who would be subcontracted to I-MATH for this SBIR. 3. Geometric hashing algorithms, which I-MATH has recently developed using a CNVEOD-provided FLIR imagery under a Phase II Air Force SBIR. Such algorithms provide a robust mechanism for multisensor fusion as well, since each feature is indexed by its geometric position. This greatly facilitates the incorporation of MMW range (z) profiles as a third coordinate to FLIR (x,y) has points.",

Imitec also proposes to synthesize LaRC-IA and LaRC- IAX derived from In-House ODPA. Polyimides such as LaRC-IA and LaRC-IAX, invented at NASA Langley, prepared from oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA) have shown excellent thermal and mechanical properties along with excellent melt-processability. These polymers are currently being tested in various aerospace and composites facilities (i.e. NASA, Northrop, Barcel Wire and Cable, Du Pont, Martin Marietta). In addition, LaRC-IA is a very light colored polyimide that can be easily pigmented and has radiation-resistance. Unfortunately, ODPA is no longer available commercially. Our market survey shows that there exists a high demand for ODPA based polyimides for many applications including NASA's composites program, the Super Collider project, fibers and some potential dental applications. Imitec expects to prepare high quality ODPA to keep current testing programs of ODPA based polymers active.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Currently used anti-cancer agents have limited selectivity for the tumor. Immunoconjugates that have been prepared from these drugs are not potent enough to be therapeutically effective. We will use 100 to 1000-fold more cytotoxic drugs and endow them with tumor-selectivity by linking them to antibodies. Thus, drugs that are too toxic to be used alone can be rendered therapeutically useful. Effective immunoconjugates will be generated by a) substituting the moderately cytotoxic anti-neoplastic agents in current use in antibody-drug conjugates with CC-1065 analogs which are 100 to 1000-fold more potent and b) linking these CC-1065 analogs to antibodies via disulfide bonds that should be stable in circulation, but efficiently cleaved inside the cell to release fully active drug. In order to realize this goal, new disulfide-containing CC-1065 analogs will be synthesized without affecting the high cytotoxicity of the parent drug. Preliminary experiments indicate that the presence of a disulfide functionality preserves the potency of the drug. The most cytotoxic of these drugs will be linked to antibodies via disulfide bonds, and the in vitro cytotoxicity and specificity of these conjugates will be determined. The antibodies we will use in this study are already being used in human clinical trials.",

The modules provide a short trigger video and a teacher's guide. A set of 7 modules is proposed with particular attention to issues identified by the National Adolescent Student Health Survey as crucial to the mental health of today's youth (i. e. HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, sexual abuse, suicide, adverse peer pressure, issues of violence, and the need for ethnic groups to live together). In Phase I, one multi- component video module will be produced and evaluated. The video in Phase I will be tested as a \"live-acted\" script versus a lecture format presentation, and as a live-acted production versus the same video enhanced with clay animation inserts. Innovations in this project include the use of clay animation; the evaluation of the product; scripts on controversial issues acceptable in most learning environments; scripts and teacher's books designed to incorporate features considered important by social action theory to support behavior change, and production of an integrated series of modules. In Phase II, 6 more modules would be produced and evaluated both separately and as part of a package.",

RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS IN PARTICULATE CONTROL, SPECIFICALLY CERAMIC FILTRATION TECHNOLOGY, HAVE SHOWN THAT NSPS LIMITS ON PARTICULATES CAN BE ACHIEVED AT HIGH PROCESS TEMPERATURES, THERE BY MINIMIZING THERMAL LOSSES AND SYSTEM COMPLEXITY.  EXPERIMENTATION WITH SORBENTS, PARTICULARLY METAL OXIDE SORBENTS, HAS RESULTED IN PROMISING SO2 EMISSIONS LEVEL REDUCTION.  MOREOVER, SPENT METAL OXIDES, SUCH AS THOSE GENERATED BY STEEL MANUFACTURING AND SMELTING PROCESSES, HAVE SHOWN PROMISE AS CANDIDATES IN SO2 REMOVAL, ON A MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE BASIS.  FOR EXAMPLE, PRELIMINARY TESTING USING SPENT IRON OXIDE DUST FROM A STEEL MILL BASIC OXYGEN FURNACE (BOF) HAS SHOWN THAT, IN COMPARISON TO AN EQUIVALENT VOLUME OF A MORE TRADITIONAL SORBENT SUCH AS CALCIUM CARBONATE, BOF DUST CAN REMOVE APPROXIMATELY THREE TIMES AS MUCH SO2 BEFORE EXHAUSTION.  BECAUSE THE AFFINITY FOR SO2 IS PROBABLY NOT LIMITED TO SPENT IRON OXIDE DUST, PHASE I WILL PURSUE THE TESTING OF SEVERAL SPENT METAL OXIDES TO DETERMINE WHICH SHOW HIGH AFFINITY FOR SO2 CAPTURE IN A LABORATORY SETTING.  THE MOST PROMISING CANDIDATES FROM PHASE I WOULD THEN BE EVALUATED IN THE PHASE II EFFORT TO VERIFY THEIR SORBENT CAPACITY BY USING THERMOGRAVIMETRIC ANALYSIS AND TO DETERMINE THEIR ADDITIONAL CAPABILITY AS HIGH TEMPERATURE FILTER AIDS, AFTER CLASSIFYING TO A SPECIFIC PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION.

This new approach for neutron imaging offers the promise of improvements in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, ontrast and spatial resolution. The imaging detector can be used for both prompt response and static situations. The program will include a comparison of neutron scintillators, including new materials such as boron nitride and gadolinium oxide-based ceramic scintillators. comparisions of selected scintillators used with a 12-bit CCD camera system will be made with present state-of-the-art thermal neutron imaging systems. These evaluations will point the way toward the development of an improved neutron imaging system for development in Phase II, one that will couple well with new acclerator neutron sources.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Infrared Components Corporation (ICC) will analyze and develop designs to adapt the existing Standardized Advanced Dewar Assembly (SADA) to include a low power optical modulator in the cryogenic portion of the dewar. Known optical link waveguide modulation devices and architectures will be evaluated with respect to the effects of the cryogenic environment. Changes in modulator parameters such as wavelength dependence, transfer function, and insertion loss, will be analyzed and projected for each modulator type. These are expected due to differing coefficients of thermal expansion, thermal strains associated with modulator mounting and fiber pigtailing, as well as microphonic effects due to the action of the piston of the cryocooler. We will create a special cryotip joint design and modulator mounting technique, as well as specify materials with appropriate cryomechanical characteristics. Designs for a cryogenic modulator with Optical Data Link will be carried out for implementation and test in Phase II. These will allow NASA and ICC to field FPA imagers with lower heat load on the dewar, reduced Electromagnetic Interference, and low cross-talk for parallel multiport readout.",

Successful implementation of the proposed technology will impact two critical issues of our time - infrastructure and the environment - through recycling of some prominent plastic wastes into cost-effective rehabilitation materials with desirable performance characteristics. Phase I research evaluates the technical feasibility and economical viability of developing polymer concrete rehabilitation materials through depolymerizing impure and color post-consumer PET wastes. For this purpose, PET scrap sources and depolymerization process capable of generating unsaturated polyesters with acceptable processability and clear-cast resin characteristics will be identified. Optimum composition of polymer concretes incorporating recycled polyester binder will then be determined based on set characteristics, short-term engineering properties, and cost. Finally, market potentials of recycled polyester concrete will be determined through technical and economical evaluations against conventional rapid-setting rehabilitation materials.",

The principal Phase I objective is to prove the pressure infiltration of high temperature superalloy and inter- metallic composite concept. Experimentally, we will develop casting processes, and in doing so, we will examine the compatibility of various hybridization particulate candidates, mold, fiber coating and mold coating materials with NiAl and In 718. We will manufacture flexure and CTE specimens for the evaluation of ambient and high temperature flexure strength, CTE, and thermal cycling behavior. The following results are expected: Through use of hybridization, we will 1) achieve exact positioning of fibers in the preform and subsequent casting, 2) reduce CTE mismatch strains to tolerable levels and eliminate radial and longitudinal cracking, and 3) demonstrate a low cost process for the manufacture of low defect, high integrity, high performance, net shaped components.",

These modules together comprise a retrocommunications data readout system which can easily meet the objectives of data transmission from remote parts of a test aircraft or missile to a central acquisition systme without the need for connecting wiring, without the need for supplying power to the remote location, and while operating in the environment of a modern jet fighter aircraft. The retro transmitter can be made very small, say the size of a rivet or smaller, and can be thin and flat if desired enabling easy integration into or onto the aircraft or missile skin. The power required on the remote transmitter is small, consisting only of the power needed to modulate the retro return of the retroreflector. A battery comparable to a wrist watch battery should suffice. Ruggedness obtains as a result of the small size and compactness of the device and because of its insensitivity to alignment and displacement. EMI immunity obtains because of the use of a narrow band of optical wavelengths to effect data transmission.",

Non-compliance is believed to be responsible for nearly one out of five hospitalizations and, thus, increased health care costs. The initial research focused on small scale human factors tests, the second phase will include clinical tests, and the third phase will involve commercialization. The initial target patient population is older persons who are capable of independently performing their activities of daily living, and who want to comply with their medication regimen. Future research will include a broader range of elderly persons. Initial estimates are that approximately 2.5 million of these devices could be sold.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         1The recent experience has shown that parallel systems are no longer experimental and useful systems can be built (e.g. the Connection Machine) to solve real problems (e.g. linear algebra, partial differential equations). It is also no longer the question of whether a Tera FLOPS system can be built, rather it is how can such powerful systems be used effectively. In many cases only a small fraction of system's potential power is utilized. The efficient use of these systems is a function of a number of factors, but primarily depends on exploting the application's inherent parallelism, choosing a compatible architecture, and optimally mapping the application functions into the processors. Our innovation is to develop mehtodologies (and eventually a set of software tools and an environment) which a user can employ to perform above and other tasks in support of designing an application and evaluating its performance on a parallel system. Phase I of this research will be devoted to assessing the feasibility of synthesizing the application and the architecture from a set of kernels. Phase II and III will be devoted to the actual development of methodologies and the software tools.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Healthcare professionals face the challenge of successfully managing debilitating pain in patients with cancer. To meet this challenge, they must understand the nature and significance of cancer pain, and the prevalence of inadequate management. In addition, they must gain adequate knowledge about available therapeutic resources. We will develop a software tool, Talaria, which will provide this information in a particularly enabling fashion. Talaria will provide just-in-time training, and it will function as a comprehensive reference tool. Our goal is to build a virtual personal assistant for clinicians managing cancer pain. Existing and forthcoming clinical practice guidelines formally define much of the knowledge base for Talaria; however, we will extend it in several directions. Our research will exploit new developments in multimedia, hypertext and educational technologies to make the tool effec- tive, comprehensive and engaging. In particular, Talaria will employ a travel metaphor, implemented with graphics, to provide intelligent guidance for the clinician. We will use well-established software tools to develop Talaria and will make it available on inexpensive hardware. We will carry out a formal evaluation at key points in the project.",

It is clear that new animal models should bedeveloped. National and international experts have recently recognized the turkey model as useful in thestudy of heart failure. This furazolidone-induced myopathic model possesses key similarities to recentlydefined human heart failure which makes it worthy of development. By developing this model ofcardiovascular disease in a non-mammalian species, investigators can gain new insights into thepathophysiology of heart disease and test new pharmacologic agents for therapeutic efficacy andpotency. Our overall objective is to make available an animal model of heart failure in turkey poults toindividual investigators and to the pharmaceutical industry. There will be a tissue bank available toinvestigators not requiring live animals for in vivo studies. We will provide a number of services toinvestigators who would like to test experimental agents on these animals or perform basic research inour facilities. Phase I will establish the requirements for efficiently producing dilated cardiomyopathy ofvarying degrees and durations in turkey poults and establish wet lab facilities.",

The OMHTS will consist of the following: (1) battery of measures providing for patient self-report and clinician ratings; (2) procedures for collecting these data at selected intervals during treatment; (3) analytic procedures and a normative database to compare an individual's progress with that of similar patients; and (4) software to scan raw data forms, generate reports on the status and progress of individual cases, and the performance of the provider network. The OMHTS will be an innovative product. This product is needed by managed care providers to maintain quality of care standards in the face of cost containment pressures. It will be useful to clinicians and clinical supervisors, utilization review (UR) specialists, and manage care networks. It can be used by these persons to monitor case progress, inform UR decision-making and improved the cost -effectiveness of managed care networks. An OMHTS prototype will be developed and evaluated during Phase I. Specific tasks are to develop OMHTS procedures and materials, establish an OMHTS database, conduct construct validity analysis of OMHTS measures, develop an extended validation plan for Phase II, and develop software to generate individual patient reports.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Dense arrays of high-frequency photonic devices could provide many advantages to several Department of Defense systems currently under development. One example is their usage in phased-array radar systems. However, crosstalk from one device to the next must be kept at very low levels in order to not degrade the system performance. Often, crosstalk levels are required to be less than -100 dB electrical. These are very low levels when operation frequencies can be between I and 30 GHz. We propose to investigate methods of achieving dense arrays of traveling-wave electrooptic modulators that will satisfy these stringent crosstalk specifications. These methods will utilize various optical and electrical shielding structures integratable on the array substrate as well as on the electrical interconnect circuits required to impress the electrical drive signals onto the device array. In summary, the problem considered in this Proposal is that of dense arrays of highly-isolated, high-frequency photonic devices. The intent is to develop methods of optically and electrically isolating dense arrays of devices without compromising the high performance required of the individual devices. The techniques discussed here could have significant impact on systems applications in the defense and commercial sectors. Anticipated Benefits: The anticipated benefits of this R&D; is the ability to integrate high-performance devices into cost-effective dense device arrays. These arrays can be used in systems where in the past the cost of the number of discrete devices required was prohibitive; thus capit- alizing on the large investments already made in the development of discrete high-performance devices.",

The system must be generic to accommodate a variety of helicopters and flight decks. The system must acquire the approaching helicopter, track it to touchdown and measure its position relative to a fixed earth and a fixed ship coordinate system. Since a video record of the helicopter approach is required anyway, a logical choice for the sensor would be a video camera. Integrated Sensors, Incoporated (ISI) has developed a fast, non-contact, displacement and orientation object tracker that can perform real-time passive helicopter position measurement. Consisting on only three major hardware components--one passive sensor, a high speed signal and data processor, and decals or templates to identify points on a tracked object--this object motion tracker measures the six degrees-of-freedom required to fully characterize the absolute spatial pose of an object (three displacements and three rotations). A camera could be placed on the ship (not necessarily on the flight deck) so that the tracking system could locate the position and orientation of the helicopter in three-dimensional space.",

Models for control design differ from those used for studying the detailed physics of these systems. Integrated Systems, Inc. (ISI) proposes to investigate several different modeling approaches for control system design of semiconductor processes and develop a software modeling tool. We propose to apply the techniques to a Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) process. RTP is a state-of-the-art method for performing several important steps in semiconductor wafer fabrication. A physically-based model of the process will be derived using a method for modeling ther thermal process as a nonlinear passive network. The model will be linearized for control design. A standard input-output model will also be derived as a baseline. In Phase I, models will be developed and evaluated in a computer simulation. In Phase II, a set of comprehensive models and associated software will be developed and demonstrated on a new commercial RTP chamber. The chamber will be used to evaluate and compare the various models. Use of the models promises to yield significant improvements in process control performance (temperature uniformity, repeatability) compared to the existing methods.",

(ISI) proposes to create a software design tool for integration of a high fidelity simulation and model- based process control algorithms for semi-conductor equipment processes and apply it to a rapid thermal processing (RTP) chamber. In particular, it is proposed to develop the capability to interface general-purpose finite-element thermal and fluid-mechanical simulators with advanced process control algorithms. This new simulation capability will greatly enhance the industry's ability to prototype and test advanced fabrication equipment and control algorithms. Because the large-scale physically-based simulators represent the essential nonlinearities in the system, they can be used to develop sensor-to-actuator response surfaces before hardware is built. Enormous time and cost savings can be realized by testing control algorithms on simulators before building and testing hardware. The methods used will be compatible with robust control approaches. The simulation can be used to derive a set of linear models and quantitative measures of modeling errors for robust control. Methods for interfacing the controller to the simulation will be developed and demonstrated in Phase I. In Phase II, a variety of new designs will be performed and evaluated. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - The integration technique will be validated on the model of an RTP chamber. As a result the potential commercial application is great. ISI envisions producing a stand-alone closed-loop simulation software product.",

The traditional role of flight control systems (FCS) in providing stability and command augmentations must be expanded to achieve enhanced maneuverability, combat effectiveness, and self repair. Recent advances in the development of fuzzy logic controllers and neural networks provide a unique opportunity for achieving highly integrated, reliable, robust and adaptive fllight control systems which enhance maneuverability, accommodate uncertainties,and simplify design and maintenance. During the proposed work an innovative fuzzy control system architecture, namely the Fuzzy-CMAC (cerebellar model arithmetic computer) neural network, will be evaluated for use in advanced flight control systems. This architecture exploits a synergism between the CMAC neural network and fuzzy logic control. CMACS and fuzzy logic are similar in terms of input encoding and mapping structure. Different features of both models are compared and a Fuzzy CMAC model which combines preferred features of both models is then established. The fuzzy CMAC controller utilizes available human control experience in the initial construction of its knowledge base. Then the CMAC neural network further provides powerful self-learning capability and flexibility in achieving robust performance over an expanded fligh envelope.",

The development of new techniques is much more likely to produce a costeffective means of meeting the goals of the Human Genome Project. One important component ofassembling a sequencing reaction is to step along a DNA fragment using an oligonucleotide to prime thenext portion of the sequencing reaction. This type of oligonucleotide priming only requires about 5picomoles of oligomer; conventional synthesizers produce more than 10,000 times that amount. Thisproject involves the development of a synthesizer that can produce smaller quantities appropriate forsequencing at costs that are an order of magnitude lower than conventional systems. The projectcombines recent advancements in low cost parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides with advancedcomputer controlled machinery. Using the pin array parallel synthesizer concept developed by Dr.George Church, the plan is to design a completely integrated synthesizer instrument that requires littleoperator intervention and has small reagent costs. The phase I project will involve a close cooperationbetween academic and small business researchers and will generate an initial design for the instrument.The phase I objectives include developing a set of requirements for oligonucleotide synthesis forsequencing, design of a loading/unloading system for glass beads, developing a fast, automated cleavageand deprotection system, and developing a design for a phase II instrument. The phase III project willentail the commercialization of a parallel automated oligonucleotide synthesizer, which, if successful,can produce oligonucleotides at less than 1/20 the cost of conventional systems.",

These innovations will enable the Separation Anxiety Test to be administered more readily to larger samples at lower cost; lower cost widens availability to investigators. Successful completion of Phase I objectives will lead to a fully implemented system in Phase II which will be used to administer the projective measure to 250 children. The research will more firmly establish the utility of a projective method for assessing an important dimension of child socio-emotional development. The project will also demonstrate that technological innovations in the administration and scoring of protective tests could enable this class of psychological tools to become more widely employed in research and applied settings as well as in survey research.",

Tasks such as ammunition handling, resupply, and logistics applications often make use of mobile robots such as a Cybermotion robot. These mobile robots have a severe deficiency in that there is sufficient slippage between the wheels and the floor that after very short distances, the robot no longer knows its position. Once the robot docks at a station the position can be re-established but this is inadequate because it is slow, unreliable, requires expensive hardware at each docking station, and does not help the robot navigate between docking stations. We believe we have a practical, reliable system which will provide the position and orientation of a mobile robot at a rate of 60 measurements per second. No wires at all are required between the robot and the base station, and the system is portable and requires only a single base station whose position and orientation is known relative to the work area.",

Fuzzy Reinforcement Learning has been shown to provide automatic fine-tuning capability for several experimental systems. In particular, the GARIC architecture developed at NASA Ames, is an experimental system which demonstrates the process of automatic rule refinement. Here, we propose to extend this theory with Genetic Algorithms. The main innovation in this research is the idea of replacing the Stochastic Action Modification method, as currently used in fuzzy reinforcement learning, with the more powerful search techniques of genetic algorithms. We will explore the feasibility of developing a commercial software tool based on extended fuzzy reinforcement learning and Genetic Algorithms. The development of this method and its software shell will significantly contribute to the use of knowledge-based systems for aerospace applications as stated in the topic 06.05 of the 1993 SBIR program solicitation.

Faster, more efficient means of iterative construction and modification of weapon system prototypes may be accomplished in virtual, rather than physical environments. The current virtual prototyping technology may be imporved by constructing an immersive virtual environment (VE) in which the designer sees the visual and spatial characteristics of the system in a head-coupled display and interacts with the environment with instrumented gloves allows natural manipulations and gestures, and providng tactile and force stimulation representing interactions with the VE. Addition of a virtual auditory environment may enhance the kinesthetic experience. Current limitations of the hardware used in VE systems may adversely influence prototyping performance. We will conduct design task analyses and interative experimentation to determine which combination of VE system components will provide the best VE for the designer. The research is also important for determining the fidelity of the VE system necessary for optimal performance. The research and development team has extensive experience in creating rapid prototyping tools, designing and developing virtual environments and crewstations, and conducting experimental and human factorsresearch; it should prove to be a productive team.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The magnetic tape recorder developed by NASA for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VREC) can record at 500 Mbyte/sec and store 700 Gigabytes of data on one reel. It is commercially available at moderate cost but does not include application-specific formatting and error correction. The innovation we propose is to investigate the development of a flexibly configurable user-to-storage interface for the VREC for use in the High Resolution Microwave Survey (HRMS). This interface will perform all formatting, error correction, modulation, recording interface, and user interface functions. The resulting system will satisfy the need of the HRMS for high-speed, wide-bandwidth, high-density storage media capable of handling 100 to 1000 Mbyte/sec to be used for recording and archiving large volumes of data at minimal cost. Phase I will evaluate the means by which the desired interface can be developed, how it will interface to the user, and how much it will cost. The final product will be a realistic preliminary design. NASA will benefit from satisfying the recording needs of the HRMS and possibly other projects with similar needs. Commercial applications include use as a high-speed computer network and supercomputer peripheral, and high-energy physics data acquisition.",

The realization of a two terminal (p-i-n) InP quantum well solar cell with the aim of achieving a highly efficient and radiation resistant device is proposed. The device is expected to operate with an open circuit voltage comparable to a conventional InP (p/n) solar cell while the absorption of the carriers in the multiquantum well intrinsic region is expected to provide an important increase in the device short circuit current. This device should exhibit an efficiency substantially larger than any existing conventional solar cell without the usual shortcomings of the high efficiency device schemes such as III-V tandem solar cell (process complexity, current matching, interconnection between subcells).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Mobile battlefield power support systems in use today are excessively noisy, have thermal management problems, and produce unhealthy exhaust emissions. These characteristics present serious logistic limitations in terms of the labor intensive effort required to achieve covertness and healthy, productive working conditions for the Navy personnel. This problem is expected to become more acute as more sophisticated electronic subsystems such as communications navigation, portable radar, ranging, and portable computing equipment are placed into service. In order to achieve the highest level of effectiveness that is possible with advanced technologies, the Navy has a critical need for high quality, unobstrusive power support sysstems. A program to develop a new generation of mobile battlefield power support systems meeting all the requirements specified by the Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory is proposed. The proposed effort is highly leveraged against ongoing research being carried out by the proposing firm under the auspices of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). To date, InterScience, Inc. has demonstrated a 500 Watt, 1 lb permanent magnet alternator that scales readily to several kilowatts and is designed to operate with DF-2 and JP-8 burning engines that are presently being developed for the U.S. Army for use in soldier backpack power/cooling units. Based on this experience, InterScience, Inc. is intimately familiar with practical issues including noise control, exhaust emission control, thermal management, varible load condition, etc. As part of the Phase I deliverables, the existence of suitable engines and generators will be established as well as the capability of the proposing firm to implement a microporocessor-based control system including miniaturized sensors and acturators that are required to achieve clean, unobtrusive power. The design will be based on mass production technologies such that the resulting power supply modules can be produced at low cost.",

AN IMPORTANT APPLICATION IS IN CONTROLLED FUSION RESEARCH WHERE FLUCTUATIONS IN THESE QUANTITITES ARE KNOWN TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT EFFECT ON ADEQUATE CONFINEMENT OF THE THERMONUCLEAR PLASMA TO REALIZE NET POWER OUTPUT.  DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS, BEAM PROBE MEASUREMENT ON EXPERIMENTS SUCH AS THE ORIGINAL TEXAS EXPERIMENTAL TOKAMAK (TEXT) HAVE CONCENTRATED ON THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE INTERIOR FLUCTUATIONS, AND LARGE DISCREPANCIES STILL EXIST BETWEEN THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS AND EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS BY A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES.  THERE IS, THEREFORE, A NEED FOR MORE DEFINITIVE EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS.  TO DATE, ONLY TWO-POINT CORRELATION TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN USED ON THE BEAM PROBE DATA.  THE RESULT IS THAT ONLY THE MEAN WAVE-NUMBER, K, AND THE SPECTRAL WIDTH, SIGMA K, OF THE TURBULENCE DISTRIBUTION, S(K,W), CAN BE DETERMINED; NO INFORMATION CAN BE EXTRACTED ON OTHER FEATURES OF THE SPECTRUM.  BY EXTENDING THE RANGE AND NUMBER OF SAMPLE VOLUMES SIMULTANEOUSLY RECORDES, A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE LOW-K TURBULENCE MEASURED BY THE BEAM PROBE CAN BE ACHIEVED.  THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY PLACING AN ARRAY OF BEAM DETECTORS NEAR THE PLASMA EDGE.  HOWEVER, TO OBTAIN THE ACCURACY REQUIRED FOR DENSITY FLUCTUATIONS IN TOKAMAK EXPERIMENTS, THE DETECTORS MUST BE SENSITIVE TO 0.1% OR BETTER IN THE HARSH ENVIRONMENT NEAR THE PLASMA EDGE.

Based on focus group data obtained expressly for this study,written and software interventions for health behavior intervention will be developed for nonschoolsettings. Foci for interventions are the prevention of tobacco, alcohol, and drug use and the appropriatecontrol of anger among target high-risk youth. Once developed, the interactive microcomputer softwarewill undergo field testing in a randomized trial with a sample of high-risk youths in nonschool settingswithin New York City. The ability of the software to effectively and efficiently deliver health behaviorintervention content will be examined by comparing the software curriculum with a conventionalintervention curriculum. Of interest to the comparison will be outcome variables on high-risk youthsubjects measured before and after intervention delivery and process variables measured duringintervention. Data from Phase I will form the basis of a Phase II proposal to expand and carefullyevaluate interactive software for health behavior intervention among high-risk youth in nonschoolsettings. If found effective and efficient, software produced in Phase II will be disseminated nationallyto relevant community organizations to reach the greatest number of high risk youths at the lowestpossible cost.",

Severity is to be measured on a disease-specific basis by assessing the patient'sphysiologic condition. Performance of treatments will not affect measurement of the patient's severityof illness. The index will provide an overall patient severity level that accounts for the extent andinteraction of all diseases present. In addition, it will also provide a severity score for each individualdisease. The severity index is to be computerized, which will enable users to compile a dynamic,relational, physiological, severity-adjusted patient database. The database will be available forcomparative analyses, outcome studies, and clinical practice improvement studies. This project willfocus on identifying the disease-specific physiological factors that contribute to the patient's severityof illness and on creating software programs that incorporate them.",

THE PHASE I STUDY FOCUSES ON ER:YAG LASER LENS EMULSIFICATION. THE FOUR OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY ARE: TO IDENTIFY THE ER:AG PULSE INDUCED ACOUSTIC EFFECT IN LENS EMULSIFICATION, TO ESTABLISH THE OPTIMAL LASER DOSIMETRY, TO EVALUATE THROUGH HISTOLOGICAL TECNIQUES THE PRESENCE OR LACK THEREOF OF ADVERSE EFFECTS TO ADJACENT STRUCTURES IN THE EYE, AND TO DESIGN A CLINICALLY EFFICACIOUS FLEXIBLE DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR LENS EMULSIFICATION. THIS BASIC RESEARCH IS THE FOUNDATION FOR FURTHER IN VIVO TESTING OF THE TECHNIQUE AND INSTRUMENTATION DURING THE PHASE II STUDY. THE RESULTS FROM THE IN VITRO AND IN VIVO STUDIES WILL ALLOW TIMELY DEVELOPMENT AND OPTIMIZATION OF THE OPTHALMIC INSTRUMENTATION. PREMIER LASER SYSTEMS HAS ALREADY CLINICALLY DEMONSTRATED THE ADVANTAGES OF THE ER:YAG LASER AND FLEXIBLE FIBEROPTIC DELIVERY IN PERFORMING A SMOOTH CIRCULAR ANTERIOR CAPSULOTOMY ON 10 PATIENTS. THE SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE FOR INTRAOCULAR LENS REPLACEMENT INVOLVES THE EMULSIFICATION AND ASPIRATION OF THE OPAQUE LENS.

THE DEEP SENSITIVE DEPTHS REQUIRED FOR SI X-RAY DETECTORS AND SOME OTHER SI DETECTOR APPLICATIONS ARE USUALLY OBTAINED BY A LI COMPENSATION TECHNIQUE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS LI DRIFTING. UNFORTUNATELY, THE ELI COMPENSATION, SI(LI), IS ONLY QUASISTABLE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND VERY UNSTABLE AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES. THIS TEMPERATURE STABILITY PROBLEM LIMITS THE PERFORMANCE AND GENERAL USEFULNESS OF THESE DETECTORS BY PROHIBITING MODERN DEVICE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES LIKE OXIDE SURFACE PASSIVATION AND HIGH TEMPERATURE CONTACT FORMATION. THE LACK OF OXIDE SURFACE PASSIVATION TO LIMIT NOISE FROM SURFACE LEAKAGE CURRENTS PLACES SEVERE RESTRICTIONS N THE MAXIMUM OPERATING TEMPERATURE OF LI-COMPENSATED DETECTORS. THE LACK OF A RUGGED OXIDE PASSIVATION AND RUGGED DIFFUSED OR IMPLANTED CONTACTS RESTRICTS THE OPERATING AMBIENT OF SI(LI) DEVICES. THIS PROJECT OUTLINES AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO COMPENSATION OF SI WHICH SHOULD ALLOW SENSITIVE DEPTHS >3 MM, BE COMPATIBLE WITH HIGH TEMPERATURE OXIDE PASSIVATIONS, ALLOW HIGH TEMPERATURE CONTACT FORMATION, AND BE MUCH CHEAPER THAN LI DRIFTING.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The innovation is a compact focal plane assembly consisting of a 3D stack of readout electronics (ROE) and a very high resolution image sensor (see Figure 1). Its innovativeness is in the application of stacked memory performance attributes (extremely dense electronics and short, massively parallel, low capacitance connections) to high resolution sensor performance problems. Many short sensor outputs connect the sensor to the ROE, and much more circuit area is behind each sensor line than in conventional planar hybrid FPAs. The large circuit area behind each sensor line, and fast, short interconnections address the following needs from the solicitation: 1.\tSub-electron read noise for detector arrays: \t \t\tLarge geometry, low noise preamplifiers minimize read \t noise, and ADCs make focal plane outputs more robust 2. Thermal isolation of electronics in cryogenic dewars: \t A large number of parallel, slower circuits (especially \t ADCs) dissipate less power than a single multiplexed fast \t circuit. Internal generation of logic signals reduces \t the thermal load from I/O wires through the dewar wall. 3. Event driven readout of large detector arrays. \t There is enough area on the focal plane to provide event \t driven logic.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A program leading to the definition of a spaceborne attitude determination system based upon gravity field measurements is proposed. The specific innovation involves processing gravity gradient measurements from a network of accelerometers. Precision determination of attitude (0.003 degrees) can be expected at an update rate of 10 Hz. This project addresses the need for a high-accuracy, low-cost, low-power, and low-mass attitude determination system for use on-board spacecraft, in particular small momentum biased, nadir pointing satellites. The proposed systems engineering consists of six tasks: 1) measurement error analysis, 2) attitude determination accuracy definition, 3) gradiometer survey and system electronic design definition, 4) requirements for the satellite hardware suite, 5) attitude determination flight software specifications, 6) planning for a proof-of-concept demonstration to be executed under Phase II. The expected benefits to NASA are numerous with the current trend toward development of small, low-cost satellites.",

THIS NEW MICROSCOPE WILL BRING FULL-COLOR DIGITAL VISUALIZATION OF TISSUE SECTIONS TO THE DESKTOP AND PROVIDE THE PATHOLOGIST WITH A \"PC-MICROSCOPE\" THAT IS LIKELY TO SUPPLANT TRADITIONAL MICROSCOPY. THE TRADITIONAL MICROSCOPE DOES NOT FURNISH FULL-COVERSLIP IMAGING; NOR DOES IT PROVIDE ORIENTATION INFORMATION; NOR CAN IT BE USED TO CONTINUOUSLY ZOOM. KENSAL'S PC-MICROSCOPE, USING A NOVEL LINEAR-DIODE-ARRAY SLIDE SCANNER, WILL BRING A FULL-COLOR, FULL-COVERSLIP IMAGE TO THE COMPUTER SCREEN 1 OR 2 SECONDS AFTER INSERTION OF THE MICROSCOPE SLIDE IN THE INSTRUMENT. THEREAFTER THE USER WILL SELECT REGIONS OF INTEREST FROM THE SCREEN BY POINTING AT THE COVERSLIP IMAGE WITH A CURSOR. THESE REGIONS WILL APPEAR AT HIGH MAGNIFICATION AND CAN BE PANNED, FOCUSED, AND ZOOMED CONTINUOUSLY USING A NOVEL CFM (CONTINUOUSLY FOCUSING MICROSCOPE) RECENTLY PATENTED BY INFINITY PHOTO-OPTICAL COMPANY. NO OCULARS WILL BE NECESSARY, NO MANUAL HANDLING OF THE SLIDE AND STAGE; NO MANUAL SWITCHING OF FIXED-POWER OBJECTIVES AS IN TRADITIONAL MICROSCOPY. THE PURPOSE IS TO REQUEST SBIR FUNDING TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF FAST FULL-COVERSLIP IMAGING AND TO STUDY THE COMBINATION OF THIS IMAGING MODALITY WITH A COMPLETE, DIGITALLY-CONTROLLED, ELECTROOPTICAL MECHANISM THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AS A PC-MICROSCOPE PROTOTYPE IN PHASE II AND COMMERCIALIZED DURING PHASE III.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Today, there are more military casualties due to disease than to battlefield injuries. Often, however, due to inadequate medical staff in small or remote medical hospitals, these disease-related casualties are improperly treated before return of the patients to the Zone of the Interior. In cases requiring the examination of biopsies or blood smears, the human eye is used to form a picture of the specimen as part of the decision-making process in arriving at the formulation of a treatment plan. If, in difficult cases, the image seen could be referenced quickly by use of computer intelligence to a medical image database and/or transmitted to a remote site for observation by an expert medical specialist, treatment could be improved and lives could be saved. It is the purpose of this report to propose a Phase I feasibility study that would address this problem. The study would be jointly performed under the leadership of the Kensal Corporation (Tucson, AZ) in partnership with Intellipath (Santa Monica, CA) and the Lockheed Missile and Space Division (Sunnyvale, CA). Kensal has already reduced to practice a new invention that permits the lensless formation of images of entire tissue sections and, for the National Institutes of Health, is researching a high-resolution pathologist's workstation for automated diagnosis of breast and lymph node cancers. Intellipath's product, now deployed at almost 300 hospitals throughout the world, incorporates a medical image database for reference in forming diagnostic decisions. Lockheed has produced and deployed at 120 locations worldwide the ICON (Image Communications and Operations Node) that, using DDN (Defense Data Network), permits the distribution of imagery to military installations anywhere. This workstation, if combined with Kensal's low/high resolution PCM (PC Microscope) and the Intellipath image database and expert systems software, would create a workstation, if combined with Kensal's low/high resolution PCM (PC Microscope) and the Intellipath image database and expert systems software, would creat a workstation invaluable for improving both routine and emergency medical care.

As immunoassays and biosensors move from the tightly controlled laboratory environment to demanding field conditions, the need for a more stable enzyme becomes critical. Alkaline phosphatase is the most widely used enzyme for these types of applications. A heat stable enzyme would not only allow use over a range of temperatures but would also increase the shelf life of these detection systems. Alkaline phosphatase is currently obtained from mammalian sources and is not stable at elevated temperatures. Thermophilic microorganisms producing heat stable alkaline phosphatase have been isolated by J. K. Research. The objective of this proposed research is to select a thermophile producing heat stable alkaline phosphatase and characterize the enzyme. Media will be developed to enhance enzyme production. A purification scheme will be optimized for maximum recovery of purified alkaline phosphatase. Sufficient heat stable enzyme will be produced to determine kinetic parameters and the most suitable reaction conditions.",

Historical analysis has shown that the effects of suppression are at least as (and quite possibly more) significant as the effects of attrition, yet none of the combat modesl commonly used by the US Army accuratley reflects suppression effects. As a result, the combat outcomes generated by these modesl are grossly distorted in favor of attrition. This phase I SBIR will attempt to measure and accurately model the effects of attrition using the Tactical Numerical Deterministic Model (TNDM) an historically validated combat model, to evaluate two sets of battles for which detailed informatio is available. The first set consisting of \"normal\" battles, will be used as a baseline to identify the relationships between suppression and attrition. the second set will consist of battles in which massive firepower was used deliverately for suppression, to determine the relationships between firepoer and suppression effects. In Phase II, the offeror will refine the suppressin coefficients identified in Phase I and apply them to existing Army combat models.",

NMDA RECEPTOR OVERSTIMULATION BY GLUTAMATE IS IMPLICATED IN EPILEPTOGENESIS AND EPILEPSY. THUS NMDA ANTAGONISTS WILL PROVIDE PROPHYLAXIS AND SEIZURE PROTECTION. THERE IS A DEFINITE NEED FOR SAFER, ORALLY ACTIVE NMDA ANTAGONISTS, TO AFFORD EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR THE EPILEPSIES. THE APPLICATION'S LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES ARE TO DEVELOP CLINICALLY USEFUL, NONTOXIC ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS FROM ANTICONVULSANT AMINOALKYL HETEROCYCLES BY RATIONAL ANALOGUE SYNTHESIS OF ACTIVE \"LEADS\" USING VARIOUS BASIC STRUCTURAL MODIFICATIONS. WE WILL INITIATE ANALOGUE SYNTHESIS OF LEAD AMINOALKYL-4-PYRIDINES, WHICH WILL INCLUDE TWO BASIC STRUCTURAL VARIATIONS. RESULTING DATA WILL BE USED TO GUIDE FURTHER ANALOGUE SYNTHESIS IN PHASE II.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Range imaging is the measurement of the three-dimensional shape of an object as an array of 3-D distance values. While range imaging is a critical robotic sensing techonology, existing methods are very slow; the best current devices still produce only a few tens of frames per second. We propose to develop an ultra fast range imaging system consisting of a scanning laser and a sensor array of photosensitive cells. The scanning laser sweeps a scene continuously with a moving light stripe, and each sensor cell of the array measures the distance by recording the time at which the incident light intensity peaks during each sweep. The noveltry of this system is a VLSI-based computational sensor which exploits the inherent parallelism of this techiques by integrating photoreceptors, analog circuitry, and digital logic on a single CMOS die. The resulting system can produce 1000 range images per second, two orders of magnitude fasterthan current systems. Also, the system will be simple and compact since it does not require a separate computer for processing signals. Phase I of this project will develop a prototype design that will lead to commercial production of a highly advanced, high-speed range imager. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: An ultra fast, 3D range imager will revolutionize the machine vision market, traditionally dominated by 2D techniques. Fast 3D vision and measurement systems will have endless applicatons, rainging from military and manufacturing to robotics, medicinge, and textiles. Examples include: whole shape measurement of a vehicle for radar refelctance simulation; design and inspection of manufactured parts; tele-existence via 3D images; and 3D imaging of the human body for reconstructive surgery, design of protective equipment, and the fashion industry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         K2T, Inc. proposes to design a walking machine for shallow underwater mobile operations. Development of an underwater walking robot is important due to the need to explore ocean bottoms for oceanography, bottom tomography, performing pollution assessments, and ship inspection. Shallow water in particular is a difficult portion of the ocean to explore due to the heavy currents and surges common in coastal waters. The objective of the Phase I research is to design a walking machine which can operate in the presence of subtantial fluid perturbations. K2T will draw upon its experience as the mechanical designers of the Antarctic volcano exploration robot, Dante, to create a design which overcomes much of the difficulties associated with fluid perturbations by emphasizing stability, a conservative gait, and a straightforward vehicle controller. The results of the Phase I effort will be a feasible design including system configuration, formulization of walker controller, performance specifications for legs, kinematic simulations, force stability study, gait study, and feasibility assessment based on biological principles and comparisons to predecessor walking machines. This design will provide a foundation for the Phase II construction of a prototype walking vehicle.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Two new families of Liquid Membranes have been developed for cleaning oily waste water and removing dissolved solids from water. One, called Membrane-Like-Material (MLM) is formed using chlorinated solvents, which are solvents removed to far below their solubility in water. The dissolved materials in the water are not removed by the MLM and a second system based on surfactant mono-layers on air bubbles coated with the ions of Alum and Sodium Hydroxide is used to effect the separation of heavy metals from water. It is proposed that these two proceses be combined to use the same hardware to use both at the same time. Since the chemistry of each is not effective with the other, this should be possible. Thus, materials such as TCE in the presence of heavy metals in the water can be processed with a single treatment stage as one unit process only. In addition, the TCE is used to remove itself from the water, and once started the process will continue with recovered TCE. Four experiments are proposed to improve various aspects of these two technologies. The Bubble Generation of mono-layer bubbles has a lot of development room left. The MLM process could perhaps be done in the vapor phase, and dilute aqueous MLM solvent systems are known to exist. Any or all of these avenues of improvement will lead to less equipment being required.",

Individual images with spectral resolution better than 1 nm and with moderate spatial resolution are available in a high definition video format. This contract will quantify the feasibility of using a VHSI as in both commercial and military airborne surveys. Commercial applications to be evaluated include determining pelagic fish biomasses, identifying concealed Mayan ruins, mapping weed growth in grain crops and analysis of coastal water environmental issues. Military applications in identifying camoflaged tactical targets and mapping released C/B agent dispersion will be assessed. Three tasks will be performed in accomplishing these evaluations. First, VHSI data on observables representiative of each application will be collected. These data will then be used to provide a conceptual design for an airborne instrument. The accompanying design analysis will include the identification of error sources plus a sensitivity and performance estimate. The last task will provide a conceptual design of a data management system for the airborne instrument.",

Software development using SPECWARE will consist of the systematic transformation of formal specifications into executable programs, using high-level design steps formally represented within the system. The emphasis will be towards automating the design process by formally representing all processes and products relevant to design. This, in turn, will support iterative design and the integration of evolution with design. SPECWARE will be a \"shrink/wrapped\" tool, commercial off-the-shelf software that comes complete with manuals, books, and training classes. The tool will be roughly analogous to a hardware design workstation for VLSI, but based on a solid theoretical foundation for software design. SPECWARE will be based on a small set of powerful core concepts, logical theories (knowledge modules), morphisms between theories (translation between modules), and colimits (composition of modules) which have been implicitly present in several research prototypes at Kestrel Institute, most notably the KIDS and DTRE systems. The work involved in producing the SPECWARE tool is the redesign of our current synthesis environment into a more open, robust, extensible, scalable, customizable, and usable architecture.",

The Matched Shear Impedance Hypothesis advances the conjecture that dolphin blubber represents a \"matched-load\" to the turbulent boundary layer \"shear-generator\", thus delaying the onset of turbulence over the dolphin up to speeds of ~10 knots, or the equivalent Reynolds number of Re~ 2 x 10-7. If wuitable \"synthetic blubbers\" can be developed they could be expected to significantly reduce the hydrodynaimic drag of an AUV and, thereby, increase its effective range.

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal outlines a program of work that will develop a test procedure to identify faulty wing bearings without removing the wing assemblies from the aircraft of Navy F-14 aircraft. The acoustic emission (AE) NDE technique, outlined in this proposal, would provide a nonintrusive, insitu method of inspecting wing pivot bearings. The proposed method would also provide insight to the wing pivot bearing integrity, and help to schedule aircrft on a more empirical basis. Currently, the Navy's F-14 wing pivot bearings are being changed according to a time schedule or when wing sweep causes excessive noise in the bearing. The problems with this method is that replacing the bearing on a set time schedule is costly since some bearings do not need to be replaced. Also, some wing pivot bearings fail before the scheduled replacement time, thus causing structural problems. When a failure of this type occurs, both the pilot and aircraft are at risk since the dynamic loading experienced in flight could cause cracking in the box beam. Safety-of-flight and effective maintenance could be improved if it were not for access limitation that accompany the wing pivot joint. This limitation causes the removal of the wing to gain access to the bearing, which amounts in large sums of time and money. Thus, by using acoustic emission nondestructive testing techniques, valuable information concerning the structural integrity of the wing pivot bearing and wing box could be acquired without the removal of the wing assemblies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         There have been significant advancements in automated probabilistic reasoning and decision analysis leading to effective computer-based medical diagnostic and test management tools. These systems enhance the quality and efficiency of healthcare by (1) providing advice about the likelihoods of alternative diseases, given sets of presenting symptoms, and (2) performing cost-benefit analyses about the next best tests to perform, through a formal weighing of the costs and benefits of alternative tests in a way that maximizes expected utility. However, a critical problem remains largely unsolved: We have found that even modest inconveniences imposed on the ergonomics of medical care by diagnostic systems often make them unacceptable to medical personnel. We will perform research on possibilities of handsfree computation in medicine and develop demonstration \"hands-free\" interfaces. Such interfaces allow medical diagnostic systems to become computer-based \"medical associates\" that work elegantly with healthcare personnel who perform examinations and procedures. We will extend KI's diagnostic systems interface, which rely on a mouse-based \"select and click\" approach, to work with healthcare personnel in a handsfree manner through integration with (1) speech recognition to drive menu selection, (2) personal head-mountable displays, and (3) sensors for automated entry of vital signs. We have already been successful at preliminary experiments in hands-free computation in medicine, and, thus, are Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Development of techniques that allow people to access computer information in a handsfree manner promises to benefit applications in the defense and civilian sectors. The interface methods will prove valuable for diagnosis of equipment failure and in situation assessment. The technology also promises to be useful in a diverse set of civilian applications, from systems for assisting intensive-care unit physicians to process control.",

To facilitate compliance monitoring and to improve cost-effectiveness of control technologies, a reliable, continuous CVOC monitor is essential.  Current CVOC instruments do not meet this growing need for air toxic monitors.  Such monitors must be inexpensive, continuous, capable of analyzing ppb level so CVOC's, robust, field usable, and capable of alarms, hardcopy compliance documentation, and signal processing for control systems.\r \r The Phase I research clearly demonstrated the technical and economic feasibility of a continuous CVOC monitor meeting these requirements.  The monitor exploits a unique CVOC oxidation catalyst to convert CVOC's exclusively to inorganic chlorine compounds, which in turn are measured by existing commercial instruments.  Enhanced sensitivity arises from the favorable reaction stoichiometry, allowing measurements at ppb levels of CVOC's.",

It is proposed to develop this technology for pressure transducers. The key innovation of the process is the bonding of a sensor to a planar cover-wafer which contians through-wafer inteconnects. The sensor is hermetically sealed within the cover and is thus protected from the outside environment. The encapsulated sensor can be surface mounted to a header or board without external wires. This allows part of the packaging to be accomplished at the wafer level, enabling the benefits of batch fabrication to be applied to the package. The cover-wafer can also contain signal conditioning electronics to amplify and compensate the sensor's output. Integration is thus achieved at the wafer level, resulting in a reduced pin-count, which will lower the cost and improve reliability. This \"smart sensor\" is integrated vertically, thus allowing the independent optimization of the sensor and electronics with the coupling of the two.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         High power, efficient, compact laser sources are required by the Air Force in the near future for communications and other applications. Our novel approach to these requirements comprises a diode-pumped, electro-optically tunable, single frequency monolithic microlaser. In such a device, the output frequency is tuned simply by applying a voltage to the laser. This is in contrast to slower frequency-fast linewidth of 10 kHz; making it ideal for coherent communications. Microlaser technology combines this potential with compactness and low cost and represents a substantial improvement over current state-of-the-art non-planar lasers. The Phase I program includes the demonstration of a narrow linewidth, frequency stable infrared micro laser, together with the design of a diode pumped amplifier with 20 - 50 Watt average power.",

Color coding of symbols on electronic displays improves human performance at tasks requiring the identification and location of specific information. Effective implementation of color coding on CRT displays is presently limited by the inability of the current theories of color difference formulae in predicting distinguishable colors for small symbols. The formulation of a field size dependent color difference metric will enable symbol and display designers to optimize the use of color on self luminous displays. During the Phase I effort we will develop a theoretical model that aids in the design of symbology for color CRT displays. The effects of ambient illumination and surround color as factors in producing a reliable model for color discriminability also will be addressed in the study. The proposed program will utilize experiments with observers to determine the proper weighting vectors to modify the color difference metric. The effectiveness of a particular set of weighting vectors will be based upon how well the modified color difference metric yields discriminable colors as the field size is decreased under various illumination and surround conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Laser treatment of vascular skin lesions, such as port wine stains, has been attempted with amyriad of laser systems. Early therapeutic efforts resulted in unacceptable scarring that was attributedto unselective heating of tissue. Understanding the mechanisms of laser-tissue interactions lead to theclinical application of pulsed lasers which selectively target the vasculature and leave the surroundingtissue thermally unaffected. Despite these advancements, the optimum laser pulse duration has yet tobe investigated. Modeling predicts that a pulse width of several milliseconds would be ideal.Flashlamp-pumped dye lasers (pulse width = 0.4 ms) create pulses which are short to avoid bruising,or purpura, and are localized to the irradiated spot. Purpura is a result of vessel disruption and is not adesired clinical or cosmetic endpoint. Continuous wave lasers (exposure time > 30 ms) result inscarring due to overheating the vessel. We will develop a solid state laser capable of generating pulsesbetween the range of one and ten milliseconds. This laser is a modification of a surgical laser wecurrently manufactured. As part of this study, the laser's effectiveness at coagulating vessels in ananimal model will be compared to that of the flashlamp-pumped system.",

Specifically, we plan to develop a hypermedia based program for presenting to workers site- specific information on working conditions. The program would be a health promotion and risk management tool as well as an information management tool. The use of hypermedia in this application offers a number of advantages over competing technologies. The hardware and software required to support hypermedia are inexpensive and readily available. Minimal hardware and software requirements also make hypermedia easier to operate and more reliable than expert systems or interactive multimedia. Finally, the very nature of hypermedia is interactive and intuitive. Hypermedia has the potential to make health-related information more accessible to employees who are at risk. Research has discovered a great deal about the causes of cancer and ways to prevent it, but many who could benefit from this research either do not know about it, or are not motivated to comply with directives for prevention. Hypermedia could be an important tool in overcoming these barriers. The concept represents a systematic application of existing knowledge toward the production of a new method for presenting health promotion and cancer prevention information.",

Elevated Lp(a) levels can be treated with niacin. Lp(a) differs from other lipoproteins by the presence of a glycoprotein, called apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], which is present in numerous isoforms that vary by size and creates significant error in assays that measure Lp(a) mass. We will measure and standardize Lp(a) by its cholesterol content [Lp(a)-c], a relatively stable component of Lp(a) that does not vary with isoform size. Specifically, Lp(a) will be separated from other lipoproteins by a lectin precipitation process devised by the applicant. Lp(a)-C will be determined in the precipitin by standard enzymatic methods. Lectin binding is a rapid and inexpensive method to separate glycoproteins by variation in polysaccharide content. Measurement of Lp(a)-c introduces less error than Lp(a) mass, as a result it is more amenable to standardization and allows for direct comparison of Lp(a) to other lipoproteins because they are routinely measured by their cholesterol content. Preliminary data indicates a high correlation of Lp(a)-c with Lp(a) mass, utilizing a standardized cholesterol assay. This assay would provide an inexpensive test similar to HDL cholesterol, for the assessment of CHD risk.",

System testing of this SRM generator will establish the credibility of the computer model and allow the computer model to be used confidently to predict the performance of any proposed 400 Hz AC SRM generator system. In addition the fabricated SRM generator system will demonstrat the feasbility of generating 400 Hz AC using an SRM generator/cycloconverter. A baseline specification for the SRM test system will be established using a retrofit plan for the F-16 generating system.",

But 3D displays needa semantic organization to be effective. That is, oncology sources such as PDQ and CANERLIT needto be structured by meaning, in order to support content-directed navigation. Information abouttherapies should be together, regardless of its source. In contrast to \"scientific visualization\", this kindof access to information is called semantic visualization. During Phase I, an inter-disciplinary team will1) design an information environment for oncology care, 2) compare three levels of visualizationtechnology, 3) determine the requirements for semantic source integration, and 4) evaluate theacceptability of the selected semantic visualization to practicing oncologists. Technologies to beevaluated using PDQ include the Xerox PARC Information Visualizer, the Montage Viewer, and theMontage Object-Relational Database. During Phase II, a prototype providing 3D access to PDQ andCANCERLIT will be coupled with one Computer-based Patient Record (CPR) and deployed at an oncologycare site. Phase III will produce a semantic visualization product for use with both local and remotesources.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Space structures which can be deployed in space by inflation have been successfully developed and utilized. This type of structure has significant advantages over alternate types of space structures. These include a low stowage volume requirement during launch, a low weight, a simple deployment approach (no mechanisms) which results in a high reliability and low cost, and the ability to form large structures in space without requiring astronaut participation. L'Garde has recently made significant advances in developing the capability to also rigidize inflatable structural components after they have been deployed. This enhances the capability to form structures with a long life since, after rigidization, the inflatant is no longer needed. Also the rigidized material is very strong. The capability of fabricating inflatable/rigidizable basic tubular structural members has been developed. However, the capabilities to fabricate the joints in a structure where several tubes are joined, as well as other design aspects of a complete structure, have not been developed. This proposed program is designed to meet this need. The completion of this development will provide a unique capability which will be of benefit in numerous applications.",

At the present time, GaN films which are produced by the most widely used folm growth technologies, have residual hydrogen which leads to high donor levels. This leads to degradation of the electrical properties and prevents attainment of high mobility n-type or p-type films. Hydrogen free films of superior electrical properties can be grown by MBE, but the growth rates are slow and the method is expensive. The purpose of the proposed program is to provide a low cost method for obtaining large area, single crystal films of GaN which are free of hydrogen and which would have superior electrical properties and device performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In many real-world systems, isolating faults is complicated by the large number of faults that can occur, the complex interactions or relationships between faults, and the presence of uncertainty. Consequently, automated fault isolation for such systems can become computationaly expensive, thereby making it difficult to provide an accurate diagnosis in real-time. This proposed work will develop an approach to automated fault isolation in the presence of uncertainty that can often provide a diagnosis in real-time. The principal types of uncertainty that will be dealt with in this work are uncertainty in the observed symptoms and uncertainty in the relationships in the fault net. Various methods for utilizing fuzzy logic in incorporating information in the form of natural language rules, degree of severity of the symptom, degree of symptom-fault relationship, continuous transition across thresholds, etc. and the combination of this evidence, will be developed and tested. As a result the diagnostic method will be more robust and accurate than when such uncertainties are ignored. This method will be applied in the problem of diagnosing failures in a space communications system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Phase l is a feasibility study of the design and synthesis of novel, non-intercalative dyes for nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) probes for DNA hybridization and other nucleic acid quantitation assays. In the past, radiolabels were used for detecting hybrids, but these are being replaced by non-radioactive probes such as oligonucleotide probes linked to fluorescent dyes. Fluorescent probes have been partially successful, but there remain significant problems associated with accurate fluorescent quantitation. Most fluorescent indicators are planar molecules that can intercalate between similarly flat base-pairs of nucleic acid helices, resulting in the quenching of fluorescence with consequent errors in quantitation, as well as loss in sensitivity of detection. We will develop new types of fluorescent dyes that are sterically hindered so as not to intercalate into the DNA helices when they are linked to probe sequences. Three approaches will be taken: 1. a sterically hindered fluorophore will be developed, 2. a \"dendritic\" spacer unit will be developed to prevent intercalation of linked dyes and to allow multiple dye attachment, thus enabling signal multiplication, and 3. a fluorophore will be entrapped within a caged system, or host-guest complex. The new fluorophores will be attached to deoxyuridine (dU) or deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP), which will be incorporated into oligonucleotide probes, the efficacy of which can be easily determined.",

A simple means for reliably determining supersonic airspeed condisitons and an optimum means for deploying the recovery parachute are described. The technique used to determine whether a supersonic airspeed exists depends only on measuring the rapidly decreasing static pressure which occurs as the ejected seat and occupant mass is declerated by the airstream. The technique used to set the recovery parachute deployment time is to continuously measure the airspeed and altitude, and after deceleration to subsonic airspeed conditions, deploy the parachute immediately upon reaching a preset airspeed for the measured altitude. The improved reliability of post-ejection sequencing as well as the increased performance capability of the escape system that will be provided by this optimized Mach number immune sequencer is discussed. A program is proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of such an optimized Mach number immune sequencer which is suitable for use in futer escape systems.",

The proposed system would provide full-authority digital control of the principal engine operating variables such as shaft speed, torque, injection timing and the like as well as starting sequences and parameter optimizations connected with operation on alternative fuels and available air. By these means, a facultative engine can be implemented whereby a highly variable amount of air can be efficiently utilized to conserve expendables to the benefit of payload, range, and endurance. The proposed system would be electrohydraulically operated and regeneratively cooled with circulated fuel thereby eliminating external cooling provisions and cumbersome mechanical drives and controls while providing convenient packaging and automation interfaces for remote command and control. The proposed investigation will examine the transient hydraulic effects, injection pulse profiles, turn-down range and design details of the components required to implement a common rail, solenoid-controlled electrohydraulic unit injection system subject to microprocessor control. Control algorithms, sensors and external signal interfaces will also be defined.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A large field of regard (FOR) infrared (IR) focal plane array (FPA) is often desirable for applications such as missile guidance, spacebased surveillance, security surveillance, thermal imaging, remote sensing, and free-space optical communication receivers. Large FOR staring IR FPA's are presently very expensive and difficult to manufacture. A possible lower cost, easy-to-fabricate alternative is to scan the large FOR over a small IR detector array. Scanning approaches using binary optics with a microshifting mechanism, line scanners, and gimbaled wedge scanners hae limitations in image quality and speed. We propose to provide a detailed analysis through a preliminary design and performance prediction of three different large search FOR IR FPA scanning concepts. Each concept has the potential to provide substantial performance improvements over previous techniques. The analyses will include parametric design studies of each scanning concept to determine a near-optimum design and the operating constraints for each concept. We will compare the designs for each concept to determine the best design for a given application. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The large search FOR IR FPA scanning concepts we propose to evaluate have the potential to provide high quality images at high speed, small size, low power, and low cost. This will benefit applications such as missile guidance, space-based surveillance, security surveillance, thermal imaging, remote sensing, and free-space optical communication receivers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Design-for-test (DFT) involves the generation of test structures, the modification of the design to incorporate the test structures, the generation of test data and the verification of both the test structures and the test data. DFT usually occurs within a standard design flow incorporating capture, synthesis, and simulation capabiiities. Existing point solutions generate some structures such as scan-chain, 1149.1 elements and do not generate all the necessary structures. Existing point solutions require the designer to be intimately familiar with DFT and require that he/she understand both the structure and its connections with the rest of the design. Coventionally, it is the responsibility of the designer to both maintain and re-use test data/structure(s). LogicVision's existing solution provide the ability to generate built-in self-test (BIST) and various other structures at the RTL and higher up levels. LogicVision intends to develope a configuration manager which will maintain all the test structures/data generated by the tools and by operating at the RTL and higher levels, the structures are connected by the configuration manager with the rest of the design. The tools thus permit the re-use of test objects and test data across the hierarchy of the design. This will result in a vertically integrated hierarchical test automation solution, which will increase designer productivity and also improve the quality of the design.",

Therefore, there is a critical need to develop and inplement instruments able to perforn nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of hidden corrosion and material degradation with a high degree of accuracy, sensitivity, and versatitlity. Thus, the understanding of the fundamental chenust^ of corrosion is essential. The pu^ose of the work outlined in this proposal is to develop a fundamental research project focused on understanding coiTosion initiation in aircraft metallic materials at the nanonieter scale and to relate it with nacroscopic properties of the material. The proposed approach is to use: (l) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to study in situ corrosion initiation and to identify surface regions where corrosion is most likely to occur; (2) impedance spectroscopy to detect changes in the impedance properties of the material due to corrosion. The effect of atmospheric pollutants on the coiTosion process will be investigate.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Treating waste sites contaminated with dioxin is both costly and difficult. Current clean up standards require that treatment reduce dioxin residuals to very low levels. The allowable level of residuals is very strict because of the assessment that dioxin poses a serious health hazard. At present, incineration is the only available technology in the US deemed acceptable for treating dioxin-contaminated materials but the public are highly skeptical about the performance of incinerators. Dioxins are extremely insoluble in water, are only slightly soluble in some organic solvents and have a strong affinity for adsorption onto organic matter and soil particles. These difficulties limit the range of remediation techniques suitable for remediation of dioxin containing soils. To meet cleanup standards, Lynntech has developed a special chemical oxidation system that offers several cost and process benefits for the treatment of dioxin contaminated soils. The merits of the new process are: (1) degradation of dioxins occurs in situ which eliminates the need to extract and treat the total quantity of the waste soil; (2) the process uses low cost bulk chemicals; and, (3) the reagents are efficiently distributed throughout the fine structure of the soil particles. Preliminary research is described that demonstrates the viability of the new process for degrading chlorinated organic contaminants in soils and initial cost estimates are highly favorable when compared to existing processes for handling and treating dioxin contaminated soil. The Phase I research will focus on domonstrating the new process in laboratory soil test cells emphasizing degradation of dioxins that are adsorbed to the soil matrix.",

THE INSTRUMENT USES A FORM OF AGAROSE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS TO SEPARATE THE PLASMID DNA AND RECOVERS IT BY ELECTROELUTION INTO ~20 UL VOLUME.  THE INSTRUMENT HAS MANY ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER ROBOTIC AND MANUAL METHODS INCLUDING THE FACT THAT IT IS TWICE AS FAST, AT LEAST SIX TIMES LESS EXPENSIVE, MUCH SMALLER IN SIZE, EASIER TO OPERATE, LOWER IN COST PER SAMPLE, AND IT RESULTS IN DNA PURE ENOUGH FOR DIRECT USE IN FLUORESCENT AUTOMATED SEQUENCING.  IN ADDITION, THE INSTRUMENT HAS ONLY ONE MOVING PART ASSOCIATED WITH ITS PURIFICATION PROCESS AND DOES NOT HAVE INTERNAL REAGENT RESERVOIRS.  THE INSTRUMENT PROCESS BEGINS WITH BACTERIAL CULTURE WHICH CAN BE LOADED DIRECTLY INTO A DISPOSABLE SAMPLE CASSETTE IN THE MACHINE.  PHASE I WILL DEVELOP A MORE COMPLEX INSTRUMENT USING THE ABOVE TECHNOLOGY WHICH WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY PROCESS 192 (2 X 96) BACTERIAL SAMPLES IN 1.5 HOURS AND ALLOW THE PURIFICATION OF BOTH COSMID AND GENOMIC DNA FROM YEAST AND MAMMALIAN CELLS IN QUANTITIES OF 3 TO 5 MICROGRAMS PER CASSETTE LANE.  THE GOAL WILL BE TO OBTAIN DNA OF SUFFICIENT PURITY FOR DIRECT USE IN AUTOMATED FLUORESCENT AND MANUAL SEQUENCING AS WELL AS OTHER MOLECULAR BIOLOGY PROTOCOLS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocol wastes bandwidth. This severely limits the number of network entities on bandwidth-constrained long-haul networks (LHNs). DIS is a fairly static protocol, in that it is difficult, time-consuming, and costly to add new types of vehicles and munitions to it. LHNs introduce transmission latencies that can adversely impact the stability of command and control feedback systems so crucial to Precision Strike. We propose a DIS variant that is much more bandwidth-efficient, that introduces less latency, and that accepts new entity and munition types more readily than does DIS. We propose to use an ARPA funded DIS extension, the Migratory Object Protocol, to overcome LHN-induced latency. This will enhance the fidelity of Precision Strike simulations.",

T FLAPS surface also allows separate V/H polarization focal points and other features for achievement of very high polarization isolation.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Malibu Research had recently developed a FLAPS phased surface technique for construction of thin electromagnetic structures having the capability of scattering incident RF energy in specific preferred directions with designof phase properties.  Its primary application to date has been the replacement of standard solid parabolic reflector antennas with a planar structure having a much lower weight and superior form factor.  To date we have used this technique for construction of several antennas for missile seeker and airborne radar applications.  One physical realization of the FLAPS antenna is construction in the form of a wide mesh \"tennis racquet\" using plated Levlar string.  Such a construction as a replacement for a solid SATCOM antenna results in a much lighter antenna and a very much lower wind loading.  The much lower weight and wind loading would allow for installation of multiple antennas on an existing pedestal and control system.  As is shown in our proposal, this FLAPS antenna lends itself very well to multiple band operation within the same antenna.  Additionally, increased performance can be obtained by increasing the size of the antenna while still maintaining a lower weight and compatibility with existing pedestal systems.  Under this proposed Phase I effort, the feasibility of such a multi-band, increased performance, lower weight antenna installed on the existing single antenna pedestal would be established.  Our proposal gives an example of a recently completed Malibu Research 20 ft. C-band SARCOM FLAP's antenna using esactly this concept for operation in 60 knot winds.",

Some current theoretical decompression models consider free gas phases in tissue; however, there is as yet no reliable mechanism for direct experimental verification of tissue gas bubble formation and growth. In this project, candidate technologies which are most likely to lead to the deployment of an instrument for the routine quantitative detection of gas bubbles in animal tissue in vivo are to be evaluated. Acoustical, radiographic, electromagnetic and potentially other approaches will be examined based upon first principals. Potential measurement techniques will be evaluated in terms of measurment accuracy, calibration requirements, ease of use in a clinical setting, equipment size and ruggednes, and cost. The most promising technology will be the focus of in depth engineering evaluation, leading to a product development and manufacturing plan should a practical instrument appear feasible.",

As a result, many different tests are used to assess liver function. Although these tests provide information concerning the metabolic state of the liver, each procedure has limitations that compromise its value. The galactose breath test represents a non-invasive method of assessing liver function, since galactose is primarily metabolized by the liver. In this test, galactose (labeled with 14C or 13C) is administered to the patient and the appearance of label in the expired CO2 is used as an indication of liver function. Although the literature suggests that this test is a good predictor of liver function, due to the radiation risk associated with 14C-galactose and the unavailability of 13C-galactose, the clinical usefulness of the galactose breath test has not been fully evaluated. The goal is to produce 13C-galactose and clinically evaluate the usefulness of this compound as a non-invasive measure of hepatic function. We will culture, in the presence of 13CO2, a proprietary microalga that overproduces galactose. The purified, labeled galactose will then be used for human clinical studies to determine the specificity and sensitivity of this test for assessing liver function.",

The CCR software improves the power of a statistical analysis by directlyincorporating the user's \"intuitions\" in a principled manner. These intuitions are formally representedas logical causal relationships. The proposed Phase I study will demonstrate using a databaserepresentative of pre-existing NIAAA sponsored databases: (1) that the CCR model is sensitive enoughto detect differences between distinct sets of logical causal relationships and patient/providersubpopulations, and (2) makes accurate predictions about the likelihoods of particular patient outcomes.The results obtained in the Phase I study provide the essential first steps for additional investigationsof model reliability, validity, and repeated measures for Phase II and form the foundation for developinga commercially available CCR software package.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Single crystals of tungsten (W) with [100] orientation have been demonstrated to exhibit ballistically equivalent performance to depleated uranium (DU) projectiles. Single crystals of W are unfortunately brittle. Also, the state-of-the-art crystal growing techniques limits the diameter of such crystals to less than 10mm. Hence, it is proposed to fabricate tungsten heavy alloy (WHA) projectiles consisting of [100] oriented whiskers/fibers held in a Ni-Fe type matrix. This proposal will address the problems of growing {100] W whiskers/fibers in a heavy alloy matrix. The whiskers/fibers will be grown by the proven VLS process in which MER has considerable expertise (prior experience in growth of SiC and TiB2 whiskers) using a [100] W single crystal substrate, a mixture of WCl6 and H2 as the reactant gases and a Ni-based catalyst (Ni-Fe, Ni-Co, Ni-Cu). The whiskers/fibers will be harvested, cold-pressed and infiltrated in-situ by the catalyst (by varying temperature and atmosphere to promote wetting). This will demonstrate processing that can produce projectiles (>10mm in diameter) for ballistic evaluation. A test scale WHA composite synthesized through the above process will be delivered to the program technical monitor.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Conventional composite processing techniques are presently unable to fabricate unidirectional fiber reinforced composites based on small diameter fibers, for example, ~5-20 um in diameter. The primary problem is one of infiltration of the matrix in between the fibers and maintaining a reasonably constant fiber spacing. An innovative MMC processing technique is proposed wherein, starting with a ceramic fiber tow, each fiber would be spread and individually coated with the matrix material by a plasma-assisted sputtering process. The continuous coated fiber can then be utilized in a variety of ways, such as fiber lay-up for uniaxial panels or weaving in 2 or 3 dimensional architecture, followed by hot consolidation to obtain advanced composites with desired fiber orientation. Such a composite processing technique is also amenable to tailoring of the fiber-matrix interface by the addition of a very thin coat of metals such as Cr or Ti (which improve adhesion of the matrix to the fiber) prior to deposition of the matrix in a single step. Further, the fiber volume fraction within the matrix can be varied by varying the thickness of the coating. By coating all the fibers to a given thickness, an uniform fiber spacing can be obtained in a hot-consolidated state. This composite processing technique is also flexible enough to accommodate a starting compliant/compensating layer, if necessary, to improve the thermal cycling performance of these composites (especially those based on relatively brittle matrices).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Filament wound carbon-carbon (C-C) composites exhibit excellent strength and thermal conductivity, routinely exceeding 160 watts/mK. In addition, by depositing carbon by CVD, the C-C composites can be made impervious. High thermal conductivity and stability of C-C composites in highly corrosive atmospheres is the motivation behind this proposed application in sodium-sulfur batteries as a container material. The state-of-the-art sodium-sulfur batteries use chromized mild steel containers for the sulfur electrode. This has three drawbacks: (1) attack of mild steel due to defects in chromized layer shortens cell life. (2) heat dissipation during charge-discharge is a limitation due to low thermal conductivity. (3) Higher specific gravity of mild steel lowers the specific energy density (energy/weight). C-C composites are ideally suited as they are superior to chromized mild steel in all three aspects. In addition, due to the additional step of chromizing that is a must with mild steel containers, the projected cost of C-C composites is not expected to be a limitation. It is proposed that C-C composite tubes will be acquired from Hercules, Inc. The issue of attachment of steel collar to the tube to form a hermetic seal will be addressed. Two sodium-sulfur cells using Na- \"-alumina solid electrolyte tubes, sodium anode and sulfur-impregnated carbon felt cathode will be assembled and tested in charge-discharge mode and peak power mode. The cells will be thermally cycled and technical feasibility of using C-C composites for sodium-sulfur cells will be evaluated. The two cells will be delivered to Air Force at the conclusion of Phase I. In Phase II, lifecycle testing and cost-effective cell fabrication, including C-C composites will be addressed.

Synthesis of ceramics, metals, intermetallics, and ceramic-metal composites can be found readily in the literature. Yet, most development effors to date have emphasized the formation of particulates and their characterization. Very few of the researchers have addressed the formidable problems of handling kilograms of such materials, forming of intermediate shapes (preform), or proceeding directly to final consolidation from the original nanomaterial. It is obvious that if engineering applications for nanomaterials are to be found, cost effective technologies to form dense, near net shape bodies must be developed. This Phase I effort proposes an evaluation of three promising but emerging consolidation techniques; plasma activated sintering, hot isostatic forging and electro discharge compaction. We will explore these techniques for their utility in consolidating nanoparticulates of interest to the Army as potential structural materials. We will perform nanoparticulate synthesis using the pulsed reactive electrode technique developed at MMI for tungsten, tungsten composites, and intermetallic aluminide or a silicide as well as commercially available nanomaterials - a ceramic material and another tungsten material synthesized using other methods such as sputtering or spray forming/CVD. We will fabricate specimens of the avove materials which can be characterized for density, microstrucutre and hardness. Finally, we will evaluate the state of development of each process and estimate its potential for scale up to fabricate commercially viable, cost effective components of interest to the Army. Phase II will then attempt to fabricate prototypes of such components and characterize them for potential use in Army systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The replacement of depleted uranium (DU) by tungsten alloys with plasma spray formed claddings is proposed. Such claddings would force highly localized shear to be continually induced by employing a thick adiabatic shear-susceptible coating or cladding on tungsten alloy cores. This cladding or composite approach enables optimal shear performance to be developed in an alloy or cladding structure without compromising the ballistic performance of the core tungsten penetrator. Chamber or vacuum plasma spray forming in controlled atmospheres (low pressure or inert gas) will be used to produce such thick claddings from powders of alloys which intrinsically exhibit highly localized, adiabatic shear. Plasma sprayed claddings of tool steels, intermetallics and titanium will be evaluated. Another method of achieving highly localized shear band deformation is through a combination of alloy and microstructure (composite/micro-laminate) whicha re plasma sprayed. Such microstructure-induced shear systems which consist of micro-laminate layered structures with alternating layers of a base alloy such as tungsten, tool steel, or titanium with TiC, zirconia, or nickel aluminide layers will also be studied. The particualte and layer processing capability of plasma spray forming lends itself to the formation of such alloys and structural claddings onto tungsten penetrator cores. The challenge will be to achieve sufficient bonding and strain compatibility between the cladding adn tungsten core. Controlled atmosphere plasma spray has the potential to improve the bond, especially with post-spray heat treatments and by grading interfaces to accommodate the strains which will induce high stresses at the cladding/core interface.",

In Phase 1, MSI plans to demonstrate the benefits of 1-3 piezoelectric composites on two large array systems of current applications interest to the US Navy: The Advanced Mine Detection System (AMDS) and Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) imaging arrays. The AMDS, now approaching its production phase, is currently using a 0-3 composite that is manufactured offshore, and has limited sensitivity and actuation ability. The Phase 1 work will be accomplished on 20-element array 1-3 piezocomposites in a test tank. In Phase 2, MSI will build full AMDS and UUV arrays for systems evaluation. At present, the manufacturing costs of these 1-3 composite transducers limit their widespread applicability in cost-sensitive commercial applications because there is no large volume application to generate economies of scale. The planned AMDS application will provide the necessary manufacturing volume and will thereby facilitate large scale commercial development.",

Retaining individuals in drug treatments may both improve the health of HIV+ addicts and limit HIV transmission. Directly and aggressively focusing on issues that address HIV+, AIDS, and interactions between HIV and drug abuse within the context of drug treatment may increase quality of outcomes for these types of clients. This project will produce a structured manual that guides drug counselors when intervening with HIV+ clients. Such a drug treatment product would have commercial value to public and private outpatient drug treatment systems. A Phase II portion of this project will empirically evaluate the protocol described in the manual in a controlled clinical trial with random assignment of subjects to treatment conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         One of the most controversial toxicology tests currently performed is the Draize rabbit eye irritancy test. In addition to the moral outcry against the procedure, the Draize test has been criticized due to the high degree of inter- and intra-laboratory variability, its lack of objectivity, and the extra sensitivity of the rabbit eye in comparison to the human eye. Nonetheless, the Draize test has become the standard ocular toxicological testing method since it was developed nearly 50 years ago. The purpose is to develop an alternative to the Draize test which is a reliable predictor of ocular toxicity. The alternative is a cell culture based corneal analog whose cellular and tissue-like behavior can be quantified in a well defined, reproducible manner as a function of exposure to a potential toxicant or irritant. Such a system would remove the subjectivity of the Draize method, increase reproducibility, and avoid the moral problems of inhumane treatment of animals.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Maxdem has developed a unique family of exceptionally high modulus, high strength, thermoplastic resins, designated Poly-X , based on processable rigid-rod polymer technology. With proper processing, these polymers are expected to lead to a new class of foam core materials with specific mechanical properties better than other organic foams and comptetitive with honeycomb core. The objective foams will feature low densities (6-12 lbs/ft ) in combination with high strength and stiffness. The new foams will form better bonds with surface skins (better contact area), will be more moisture resistant, and more damage tolerant than competing honeycomb cores. Thus, resulting foam core sandwich structures will show overall better mechanical properties along with reduced repair and maintenance and will find much use in weight-sensitive applications. The primary Phase I objective is to fabricate demonstration quantities of the new Poly-X foams via 3M's proprietary supercritical foaming method and demonstrate their superior properties (compression, flexure, and shear) in snadwich panels. Phase II eforts will include optimization of the foam composition for maximum processability and properties, scaleup of 3M's foaming process, evaluation of alternate foaming techniques, and more detailed testing of prototype systems.",

We herein propose a total synthesis of calanolide A, the most potent of the compounds reported. What is proposed is more than a natural product synthesis. It is necessary to develop an economical process for preparing significant quantities of the calanolides. A clinically successful compound in the series might eventually need to be synthesized in ton quantities to treat the large number of AIDS patients worldwide. A synthesis of calanolide A must allow for structural modification, since the intact natural product is very difficult to modify. This will lay the groundwork for the synthesis of analogues, which may be even more potent and exhibit fewer side effects than the parent natural product.",

The growth of independent living has raised the level of visibility of consumer empowerment.  At this time, very little solid data exist to indicate the level of PAS required or the preferred delivery model for the service.  The PAS, Inc. project establishes a base of solid information on required services, consumer selected delivery methods, and appropriate fee structures.  This data is collected through a series of focus groups and analyzed using a chi-squared statistic.  The results of the analysis are presented in the context of a business model - PAS, Inc. The model clearly indicates the business potential for a privately operated for profit PAS provider business.  Statistics on PAS use and disability are used to forecast market need in various regions and communities in the US.  The model forms the basis for a full business plan to be developed in Phase II of the effort.  The business plan will be promulgated through a franchising process.",

Unlike bacterial restriction endonucleases, which recognize 4 to 8 base pair (bp) DNA target sequences, Cvi endonucleases define unique 2 to 4 bp cleavage sites and lend themselves to a variety of novel fine structure gene mapping applications. However, at the present time technology transfer from laboratory-scale enzyme identification and purification has not proceeded to large-scale commercial production. We will begin the development of large-scale production of three chlorella virus DNA restriction endonucleases (R.CviJI cleaves PuG/CPY, R.CviRI cleaves TG/CA, and R.CviAII cleaves C/ATG) for which there is a clearcut demand and cannot be isolated from bacteria. Two independent approaches toward large-scale (> 100,000 enzyme units) commercial production will be examined. (i) Increased production will be sought from virus-infected algae. (ii) The DNA restriction endonuclease gene will be cloned and overexpressed in E. coli. These studies will serve as an instructive model for the commercial scale production of a major new class of gene mapping enzymes.",

SMALL MODULES INCORPORATING THESE MEMBRANES SUCCESSFULLY DEHYDRATE SYNTHETIC NATURAL GAS AT PRESSURES UP TO 950 PSIG.  HOWEVER, THE MEMBRANE MODULE DESIGN MUST BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE CONCENTRATION POLARIZATION EFFECTS.  CONCENTRATION POLARIZATION ARISES FROM THE FORMATION OF A STAGNANT GAS LAYER ADJACENT TO THE MEMBRANE, AND DECREASES THE MODULE SEPARATION PERFORMANCE BELOW ACCEPTABLE LEVELS.  IN PHASE I, THE MODULE DESIGN WILL BE OPTIMIZED TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CONCENTRATION POLARIZATION AND TO MAXIMIZE THE SEPARATION ACHIEVED.  IN PHASE II, THE PROCESS WILL BE SCALED UP TO THE PILOT DEMONSTRATION SCALE.  A FOUR-MODULE PILOT SYSTEM WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND EQUIPPED WITH COMMERCIAL-SCALE MODULES.  THE ABILITY OF THE SYSTEM TO DEHYDRATE NATURAL GAS STREAMS WILL BE EVALUATED OVER A PERIOD OF 3-6 MONTHS.  PRELIMINARY OFFERS FOR PHASE II FIELD SITES HAVE BEEN OBTAINED FROM BOTH A MAJOR GAS FIELD OPERATOR AND A SUPPLIER OF GAS PROCESSING EQUIPMENT.",

MEMBRANES ABLE TO PREFERENTIALLY PERMEATE THE MINOR ORGANIC COMPONENT ARE BEING DEVELOPED FOR BOTH OF THESE APPLICATIONS.  FOR AN EFFICIENT PROCESS, A HIGH ORGANIC VAPOR/PERMANENT GAS SELECTIVITY IS REQUIRED.  CONVENTIONAL GLASSY POLYMERS, WHICH ARE SELECTIVE FOR THE PERMANENT GAS OVER THE ORGANIC VAPOR, ARE SUITABLE FOR THIS APPLICATION.  RUBBERY POLYMERS, WHICH ARE ORGANIC VAPOR SELECTIVE, ARE IN COMMERCIAL USE, BUT HAVE INADEQUATE SELECTIVITY FOR MANY APPLICATIONS.  RECENT WORK SHOWED THAT MULTI-FREE-VOLUME, SUPER-GLASSY POLYMERS SUCH AS POLY(1-TRIMETHYLSILYL-1-PROPYNE) [PTMSP] CAN EXHIBIT A BUTANE/METHANE SELECTIVITY OF 30 WITH THE MIXED GASES.  THIS SELECTIVITY IS THE HIGHEST EVER OBSERVED FOR THIS IMPORTANT MIXTURE AND IS COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED FOR A GLASSY POLYMER.  THE REASON FOR THIS EXTRAORDINARY RESULT IS RELATED TO THE HIGH FREE VOLUME AND THE LARGE INTERMOLECULAR CHAIN SPACING OF THE SUPER-GLASSY POLYMER.  IN THIS PHASE I PROJECT, A DETAILED STUDY WILL BE CONDUCTED OF THE VAPOR SEPARATION PROPERTIES OF PTMSP, RELATED POLYACETYLENES, AND BLENDS THEREOF WITH A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT ORGANIC VAPOR/GAS MIXTURES.  IN CONTRAST TO RESULTS OF PREVIOUS STUDIES OF HIGH FREE VOLUME GLASSY POLYMERS WITH PERMANENT GASES, THESE POLYMERS ARE EXPECTED TO SHOW STABLE PERMEATION PROPERTIES IN THE PRESENCE OF ORGANIC VAPORS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Blade tip clearance in a gas turbine is critical; each increment of tip clearance reduction increases efficiency and reduces fuel consumption. In this study only the compressor section will be treated. Using a Lycoming T55L-712 turboshaft engine, which has wide commercial and military application, two stages of the compressor section will be modified to accept a shape memory alloy ring whose inner diameter changes with temperature. The compensator ring will be fabricated of an alloy whose transformation temperature is suited to the stage 2 and stage 3 of this turbine, and the design and thermo-mechanical processing of the ring will be such that when the turbine has reached operating temperature, the ring diametral change will reduce the tip clearance to approximately 0.001\". Performance will be evaluated for a range of ambient air temperatures encountered, and the stability of the compensator ring as a function of cycles of operation and dwell time at operating temperature. The tip clearance compensation by the shape memory induced diameter change of a ring insert would substantially improve engine efficiency and fuel consumption. Systems for accurately locating the rings in the shroud in both the axial and radial direction will be developed as well as concepts to facilitate assembly. Considerations will be given to extending the concept to the entire compressor section.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Mendez R&D; Associates (MR&DA;) have been exploring optical code division multiple access (CDMA) techniques to enhance the performance of Gigabit fiber optic networks. We have identified matrix CDMA techniques as particularly valuable from the view-point of network density and network throughput. The implementation of optical matrix CDMA codes depends on fiber optic time delays. Independently, silica based, lithographic techinques have been explored for advanced switchable radar time delays. Further, wavelength division multiple access (WDM) devices have been developed for ultradensity, Gigabit switchable networks. The innovation on this Project is that we propose a merger of these three distinct technologies, each with their own degree of maturity and sophistication, to produce an affordable, scalable, flexible, network concept with various applications ranging from the DoD to Factory Floor to Information Highway. On this Project we are incorporating the efforts and technology of a WDM developer (the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, JPL), is a silica based time delay developer (the Hughes Research Laboratories), a University researcher (USC, optical CDMA codes), as well as the MR&DA; (system concept, implementation, integration, and test). This approach will yield versatile ultradense, switchable, Gigabit networks with a minor investment in device technology. Anticipated Benefits: Optical Backplane bus for Commercial and DoD processors and computers -- high performance (data rate/density/throughput) router -- fiber optic interconnect for High Performance Computers -- advanced local area network -- protocol transparent switch -- scalable interconnect switch",

In Phase I, experiments will be conducted to determine the components and dimensions needed to correct for the longitudinal and lateral chromatic errors experienced with UV light. The longitudinal errors are to be corrected by incorporation of a second beam expander. The lateral errors are to be corrected by a proprietary optical system. These corrective measures will make the light path for the UV and visible beams congruent through the system to enable rapid interchanging of the excitation wavelengths or, in certain instances, allow simultaneous UV and visible excitation. Further objectives are the construction and characterization of two-dimension scanning mechanisms capable of utilizing UV or visible wavelengths. The components, configura- tions and technologies devised in Phase I will be utilized in Phase II for the design and construction of functioning prototypes of this new generation of confocal systems. In this phase, optical platforms will be designed to be attached to various commercial microscopes greatly expanding the optical range and measurement speed of this new and exciting technology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Cancer of the prostate is the second most lethal cancer in American men, primarily affecting individuals over the age of 50. The number of men at risk for this disease is growing rapidly as the population ages. This research is intended to introduce and evaluate Passive Microwave Radiometry (PMR) technology for the treatment of prostate Cancer. The PMR technique provides noninvasive, passive sensing of temperatures deep within tissue; this allows temperatures within the prostate to be measured using transurethral or transrectal microwave antennas. A major advantage of the PMR system is that temperatures are measured directly from the tissue, eliminating catheter effects. Another advantage is that the same microwave antenna can be used to both deliver hyperthermia and measure temperature. This dual function eliminates the need for additional thermometry catheters. The Phase I Program will seek to determine optimize and characterize temperature distribution of antennas to be developed as an intracavitary hyperthermia system for treating prostate cancer. Combining the PMR system with newly designed transrectal and transurethral applicators should allow intracavitary prostate hyperthermia treatments to be delivered without the need for additional invasive thermometry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Pressure stabilized arches, consisting of curved fabric tubes with closed ends and a valve for inflation and air retention, show promise as lightweight, quickly-erectable support structures for Army tents. Various methods for producing the pressurized air beams have been explored. The current method of arch fabrication is to cut patterns from flat fabric, and sew or cement seams to form the curved tube and end closure, with air-retention provided by a separate internal bladder or a coating. This method is labor intensive, and the resulting seams provide a large number of potential initiation sites for tube failure. The Army is currently pursuing both 3-D weaving and braiding approaches for producing the curved arches; however, these techniques are still in the developmental stages. Merix proposes to develop an automated method to inexpensively form the arches directly form non-woven fabric, with no seams. The Merix process should be less expensive that 3-D weaving and braiding, and should eliminate the possibility for defects in the 3-D weaving and braiding processes to degrade the arch support capabilities of the structure.",

MSI has previously developed a whole-arm coverage, non-contract proximity sensor system for articulated robots using discrete infrared and acoustical sensor elements on flexible circuit boards (sensorSkin). This implementation can be extended to function like human skin by incorporating additional sensor types: temperature, force/pressure and tactile. MSI will determine operational requirements, develop a preliminary design and determine the feasibility of this sensor sheet during Phase I. We will also investigate an innovative sensing method using instrumented compliant foam components to make up the skin. Additionally, we will investigate several temperature detection methods including contact and non-contact methods. The sensor system will incorporate media-specific snalog circuits, and common microcontroller and serial interface components on a single hybrid PC board. The sensorSkin contains digital communication and power buses, and sockets at discrete locations for mounting the sensor elements. It will be designed to be cut, shaped and bent without losing connectivity.",

By recording a wavefront that has passed through the test field, the three dimensional characterization of both the amplitude and phase information in the field is possible.

        "abstract": "Abstract         A novel nonintrusive laser probe for measurement of the structure of velocity flow fields for ground testing of aircraft turbine engines will be developed. A narrowband ArF excimer laser will be used to photo-dissociate O2. The O (1D) photoproducts rapidly react with ambient O2 to form O3, and thus \"write\" a line of tagged O3 molecules. After a fixed time delay, a novel approach to O atom detection will be employed to \"read\" the displaced ozone line. A second laser sheet (XeCl-pumped double-dye laser) will measure the progress of the tagged O3 by photodissociating ozone, and monitoring the O atom photoproduct by two-photon planar laser induced fluoresence (PLIF). The spatial displacement of the tagged line will be used to measure the velocity in time-of-flight fashion. The proposed innovation is the development of an entirely new photofragment flow tagging technique suitable for low temperature, subsonnic, unseeded flows, and application to inlet flows of aircraft turbine engines. The use of an intensified CCD camera will ensure that large areas of the flow will be imaged.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A unique, airborne particle sizing system is proposed to reliably measure the size and number of particles found in the atmosphere from their backscattering off-axis signal. The proposed technique will solve a fundamental problem in optical particle sizing that normally prevents the use of backscattering or near backscattering. Multiple wavelengths from independent laser diode sources will be mixed to produce a laser sheet to illuminate the particles. Light scattered at angles between ninety degrees and backscattering by particles crossing the laser sheet will not have the large Mie scattering oscillations characteristic of monochromatic radiation, but instead will be characterized by a near-monotonic distribution. The feasibility of using two receivers positioned symmetrically to the laser transmitter will be explored to assess the ability of establishing particle asphericity. A backscattering receiver with an interference filter centered at a wavelength of interest to optical air data systems will provide the backscattering distribution. Analyses using five discrete wavelengths near 800 nm show that particles between 0.4 m and 20 m yield a typical measurement error of 5% for known index of refraction. Phase I will include analytical studies and experimental work with particles of known size and composition.",

Absorption and scattering of collimated light passing through theoptically turbid medium produces a net attenuation of light intensity that can be measured and is directlyrelated to the dose.

Doses of the order of 10 Gycan be measured with a spatial resolution <1mm. In previous work, the MRI properties of the gel havebeen investigated and used very successfully to create 3D dose maps, but there are significantadvantages to the use of a simpler optical method of reading the dose distribution stored by the gel.The gel will find widespread use in radiation therapy practice, for 3D measurements in homogeneous andanthropomorphic phantoms, confirmation of computerized treatment planning and in quality assuranceprocedures.

The algorithms developed in this research effort will be based on the critical band model of the human ear. The critical band model has been the basis of research efforts in the past concerning noise-induced hearing loss, presbycusis, and speech recognition. Little effort, however, has been made to use critical band theory in the field of speech enhancement. The effectiveness of the speech enhancement system developed in this effort will be judged both objectively and subjectively. A battery of speech recognition tests will be employed in several noise environments under several signal-to-noise ratios. Subjective quality assessments from the listeners will also be obtained. Although the emphasis of this research will be on speech enhancement, the algorithms developed will be applicable to any known or predictable target signal.",

Existig Inlet Particle Separator (IPS) systems based on Bortex tube designs have two major limitations: their efficiency decreases with the size of particulate matter, and they are difficult and expensive to retrofit in existing APU/SPUs. The objectives of this project are to develop and assess a novel IPS system based on a boundary-layer momentum transfer concept that will greatly improve the efficiency of particle removal while operating within the performance and spatial parameters of existing APU/SPus. Prior research has shown this technique to be very efficient at removing particulates from unconstrained gaseous streams. The thrust of Phase I research is to use computer simulation modelling to analyze the trade-offs between particle removal efficiency, pressure loss, airflow, size and weight of an IPS that can be adapted to existing APU/SPUs. The resulting criteria will be used to evaluate production/retrofit costs and to create a preliminary IPS design emphasizing the higest efficiency for the lowest cost and size. Subsequent development, fabrication and testing of a prototype in phase II will confirm the efficiency and airworthiness of the novel IPS. thrust of Phase I research is to use computer simulation modelling to anal",

The method consists of microdispensing a photoabsorptive dye onto the surface of tooth then focusing a laser beam on the dye spot, which is 75-200mum in diameter. By the appropriate choice of photo-absorptive dye and laser wavelength, the system can be tuned for the optimal transfer of energy from the laser to the tooth. Thus, ablation can be achieved without photoacoustic or thermal damage to underlying tissue. In the dental hard-tissue model, a dye microdispenser and a laser-aiming optic are combined in a single, compact handpiece. The microdispenser and the laser are aligned together, so that the operator can dispense microdroplets of fluid and deliver pulses of laser irradiation simultaneously on a single spot. The purpose of the present research is to evaluate various laser-dye combinations for controlled ablation of enamel, dentin, and cementum as a prelude to the manufacture of a prototype dental ablation tool.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Acetaminophen and salicylates are contained in over 200 prescription and non-prescriptionformulations. Of all intentional and unintentional overdose ingestions of pharmaceutical andnon-pharmaceutical compounds, those of acetaminophen and salicylates are the most frequent, both innumber of exposures and fatalities. Many exposures are co-intoxications of both drugs. Approximatelyone half of all patients are children. The need for rapid estimation of acetaminophen and salicylates inacute intoxication and therapeutic monitoring is well documented. Rapid test methods for use bynon-laboratory personnel in emergency and point-of-care environments are currently unavailable. Somelaboratory spot-tests for urine exist but they lack specificity, and timely specimen acquisition, transferand analysis can be problematic. Available methods on automated instruments and compact analyzersare scarce and cost-intensive. We will develop of a novel non-instrumented dual-analyte teststripmethod for the rapid simultaneous semi-quantitation of acetaminophen and salicylates from unmeasuredmicro-specimens of whole blood, saliva and urine. The method is specific for each of the two drugs asenzymic-calorimetric detection principles are employed. Dry reagent technology enhances methodstability and product life time. Contributions of the devices are its functionality in a near-patient,non-laboratory environment, early detection, timely institution of treatment, and cost-savings.",

The time variant component of its radar cross section (RCS) behaves as a Swerling Type I target whose magnitude can be reduced by application of RAM. Various options exist for incorporation of RAM into an outer periscope head which can be retrofitted to equipment already at sea. These options include encapsulating or compound molding RAM into a finished part. Injection molding the head from a resistive plastic matrix is another possibility. The research herein looks at detailed mechanical and electrical requirements, and methodology for incorporating RAM into a plastic periscope outer head. As part of this research, flat panel samples of material are fabricated and electrically tested. Consideration is given to cost, producibility, and combat survivability of the finished parts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Under a variety of conditions, effluents from ship stacks can enhance reflectively of shallow layer clouds in such a way that the presence of ships can be detected in daytime satellite images. Multispecial observations from AVHRR abroad NOAA polar orbiting satellites have been used to identify ship tracks through enhanced cloud reflectivity at 3.7 microns, and to a lesser extent 0.63 microns. Nonetheless, some difficulties remain associated primarily with the high variability of cloud reflectivity which results from large variations in liquid water amount and droplet sizes at small spatial scales. Further, the age of the tracks can lead to signatures that are weak and, hence, can pose problems for automated detection, even though the tracks are apparent by visual inspection. In this proposal we address the problem of developing an automated ship track detection system. To do so, we propose to perform the following: 1) optimally enhance satellite images using multispectral signals; 2) determine features that best characterize higher reflectivity and curvilinearity of ship tracks; 3) apply rule-based and cluster analysis techniques to reduce the data stream to a limited number of subscences with potential tracks; 4) apply state-of-the-art neural net and statistical discriminant analysis methods as final detection filters; 5)assess detection success and error rates; 6) develop an automated prototype system design. The algorithms used here are ones that have exhibited success on this or similar problems. We will adopt the approach of applying a sequence of tests or detection filters to optimize the benefits of each and to minimize detection error rates of both types.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The design and development of the radiating portion of broad band active element phased arrays has not kept pace with the development of microwave integrated circuits. The commonly used \"Vivaldi Notch\" arrays are large, expensive, prone to manufacturing tolerance problems and their impedance can vary with respect to antenna scan angle. This effort will provide the detailed design of a 7 to 12 GHz array that is thin (approx. 1 inch from ground plane to top layer) and scan compensated from normal out to 60 deg. in any direction. This array design will contain feed and matching networks so it can be readily interfaced with MMIC T/R modules. The array design will use standard printed circuit techniques for low cost and highly reliable manufacturing tolerances. The electrical design of the arry will use proven computer codes and account for all potential radiation including feed line effects. The feed and matching networks will be designed using common microstrip methods and the connections between various layers in the network will implement plated through hole technology. This type of array is well suited for conformal applications but can be adapted to virtually any radiating aperture and can be applied to commercial aircraft radars, automated highways (IVHS) and the telecommunications industry.",

MK Research, Inc., MKR, has developed the ability to analytically determine a coating formulation that can produce the desired optical and IR characteristics. This is achieved through extensive computer simulations that incorporate input parameters which allow the user to customize the simulation to his particular need. Several tunable materials (in the 300 - 1200 nm range) have been synthesized and tested with excellent agreement to the data obtained b the simulations. In addition, MKR has developed novel microfiber technologies which can be used to incorporate the multispectral materials within, thus providing the alternative of weaving new textiles if desired. MKR is also currently pursuing the use of conductive polymers as a means to camouflage radar returns. Among other applications of these radar absorbent materials include the capaiblity to decontaminate radar return.",

Although most long term care is provided by family members, even willing caregivers find themselves unable to continue care when their loved one needs daily assistance with basic activities for living. Faced with the need for constant supervision, many families-desperately seek alternatives to nursing home placement. Healthcare Suites offer an innovative new concept that could meet the needs of many families. This module apartment temporarily fits inside an existing garage and connects to the primary caregiver's home. The study will: (a) assess the impact of using a Healthcare Suite on both the elder residing in the unit and family caregivers, and (b) obtain information from potential users, family members, and professionals to identify aspects of the physical unit and service components that could be adapted and improved.

The specific aims of Phase I are to (1) customize an existing test station for the execution of reaching movements by the right hemiparetic stroke population, (2) conduct a study to determine the normal trajectories for this type reach, (3) design instrumentation and software for delivering auditory feedback based on kinematic signal characteristics, (4) develop a feedback strategy for bringing the impaired trajectory toward the established norm, and (5) conduct a study of stroke patients to determine if the system can induce improvement of impaired trajectories, if feedback is essential for such improvement, and if there is adaptation and learning in trajectory modification. The technological innovation of the proposed work lies in the use of recent kinematic technology in physiological investigations, the consideration of different synergy patterns in the task requirements, the emphasis on training tasks that are functionally meaningful, and the use of regulated sensory feedback to effect improvement. The commercial application of the resulting system is as a rehabilitation tool to augment conventional therapy.",

The wide variability in NLO properties of these materials derives from a nearly unlimited ability to vary the chemical composition of the polymer backbone (e.g. copolymers) and side-chain substituents, or to dope an NLO inactive polymer host matrix with an NLO active guest (guest-host systems). A fundamental problem with the use of polymeric materials is the poling or aligning process needed to obtain the second order optical nonlinearity. In the proposed work, we will undertake to apply methods of enzymatic resolution to obtain optically pure chiral monomers, synthesize polymers from these monomers and examine the ability of these polymers to impart an asymmetric environment to an NLO active guest.

Optical disk drives and disk media are uniquely suited for this environment because of their durability and the flexibility associated with removable media for data distribution. However, the lack of DoD standardization on the means of defining Optical Disk Files inhibits using optical media as a universal medium for introperable data interchange. The recent development of the International Data Protocol Standard (ISO/IEC-13346) provides an opportunity to correct this. The goal of this proposal is to integrate and test a practical subset of this new international standard on the current Air Force Airborne Battlefield Command, Control, and Communications platform and related ground-based computerized tactical planning systems and to demonstrate tactical database interoperability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         High performance optics for the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft x-ray regions of the spectrum are technologically difficult. Reflecting optics, often based on multilayer reflection, are the only practical optic for most applications. MOXTEK has developed considerable expertise in multilayers for use in soft x-ray and EUV optics. The goal is to combine multilayers and other emerging technologies to innovate and develop very fine line width (,0.1 ~m period or 10,000 lines per mm) multilayer diffraction gratings for the EUV and soft x-ray spectrum. We propose with this SBIR to innovate and develop a fine line lithography technology to enable the fabrication of these very fine line gratings. Technology essential to fabricate useful, high spectral resolving power (> 10,000) diffractive and imaging optics for these wavelengths will be the final result. These optics will provide the spectral resolution to enable more accurate measurements, and a more detailed understanding, of x-ray and EUV spectra and the phenomena which produce radiation at these wavelengths. A side benefit of this innovative research and development will be the ability to fabricate other optics which are waiting for practical fine line lithography, such as visible light wire grid polarizers.",

Proposed tasks include a systems survey to define near-term candidate commercial applications and their joining requirements, selection of appropriate interlayer materials for specific applications, prediction of multiphase microstructure which may form in interlayer materials after the joining operation, properties and performance characteristics of the product joints through mathematical modeling, and fabrication and testing of promising brazed joint concepts.

The 40 to 50 um diameter fibers will be formed in situ by depositing ZrBf2 onto the 9 um diatmeter corbon fibers to give final fiber volumes of 40 to 50%. This will be followed by depositing thin layers of BN on the fibers to promote the debonding needed for toughness and them forming the ZrB2 matrix by CVI. The experimental work will be guided by thermodynamic and transport analytical modeling methods developed in a previous program. In addition to the ZrB2 CVI development, experiments will be performed to determine if SiC particulate can be added to the composites by slurry infiltration to improve oxidation resistance. Specimens will be characterized by light and acanning electron microscopy, and toughness and strength will be evaluated by pressurized ring tensile tests.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         MTL Systems, Inc. proposes to develop a standard analyzer and intermediate form (IF), called SAVANT for the DoD standard hardware description language VHDL. This standard is necessary for the widespread realization of electronic CAD tools in industrial, government, and educational institutions, and will allow designers to exploit a broad range of tools from many CAD vendors. Furthermore, evolutionary advanced in CAD tools whose interfaces conform to this standard can be integrated into existing design processes. Access to such a design environment will enable more efficient electronic designs in a fraction of the time currently required. SAVANT will be composed of several components. First, SAVANT will define a standard IF to store digital system designs. In addition, SAVANT will include an Analyzer and tools to translate VHDL into the IF, store the IF to a file, and read a file producing the IF. The Phase I objectives are to (1) establish the technical and commercialization feasibility of SAVANT, (2) establish community acceptance for it, and (3) produce preliminary design concepts for the Analyzer and IF. Ultimately, the IF will be proposed for balloting as a DASC standard, and the source code for the Analyzer will be placed in the public domain.",

DRASTIC will be an FPGA-based methodology for dynamically reprogramming modules for changing algorithms, to achieve low-cost, modular, reliable avionics (and other) systems. The effort will utilize innovative CAD techniques and tools, currently being developed at UC, for macro-based partitioning and mapping of FPGAs under dynamic conditions. The Phase I objectives will be to implement an experimental environment using the existing UC assets, apply a realistic test case to the environment to assess performance and feasibility, and use the experimental results as a basis for developing a top-level design. Interactions with the user and FPGA tool vendor communities in Phase I will also form the basis for subsequent commercialization activities. The products of the Phase I effort will be experimentally-qualified DRASTIC concepts, the top-level design, and a preliminary commercialization plan. These products will form a substantial basis for subsequent Phase II prototype development and commercialization activities.",

In Phase I, a prototype of two- and three-dimensional color atlases will be constructed from paraffin 10um cross sections of one normal mouse embryo, embryonic day 13. By comparing microscopic cross sections of a mutant embryo of the same age, prepared by the same methods, and database image of the corresponding normal embryo, we will demonstrate the ability to detect and analyze dysmorphologies in multiple organ systems in a time efficient manner. In the prototype three dimensional atlas, the ability to interactively compute arbitrary oblique slices through the three-dimensional anatomy of the normal mouse embryo will demonstrate the capability of the system to precisely match the anatomical orientation of any slice through a mutated embryo that a researcher might select for comparison. We will use the database and software tools that we develop to formulate a prototype set of tools and commercial services including, in part, a microcomputer-based CD ROM atlas and knowledge base, an online database, and a consulting service. Subsequent phases will produce the full mouse development databases, and establish an operating consulting service for the assessment of mouse dysmorphologies.",

Treatment of human fungal disease, especially in immunodeficient patients suffering from Acquired Immunodeficien- cy Syndrome, is hampered by the virtual lack of clinically useful drugs. Filamentous fungal morphogenesis and growth are the direct result of polysaccharide polymers and other materials being sequentially deposited at each hyphal apex, leading to the formation of a mature cell wall. Cell-wall assembly results in a wall containing chitin, beta(1-3) glucan, and other beta- and alpha-linked glucans, proteins and lipids. Perhaps the key step in fungal cell-wall assembly is the synthesis of beta (1,3) glucan, and its subsequent incorporation into the cell wall. Although there are a number of known glucan synthase inhibitors, each suffers from a variety of flaws that precludes their clinical use. We will develop a high-throughput, sensitive, specific screen for inhibitors of beta(1,3) glucan synthase activity. This screen can be used to identify novel inhibitors for eventual therapeutic use.",

The GPS/TPS tracking system provides intermediate data that is recorded during tracking and available for post-mission trajectory analysis. Greater post-mission trajectory accuracy can be achieved by using improved error models and making optimum use of the available data. This proposal outlines an error model analysis and post-processing technique directed at improving post-mission trajectory information. A method of generating accurate contiguous carrier phase measurements from the translated GPS signals is proposed. This carrier data will then be processed post-test to generate a \"kinematic\" solution for the trajectory. Flight test results with GPS receivers using this method have demonstrated that accuracies of better than 10 cm are possible. The degree of improvement in post-mission trajectory determination will be demonstrated using this method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The DOT has identified the need for an emergency location service as part of the IVHS program. GPS has been proposed as a method of providing location in support of this \"Mayday\" service. However, the expense, slow time-to-first-fix, and inability to compute a navigation fix except when four satellites are visible make conventional GPS receivers inappropriate for emergency location. NAVSYS has developed an alternative, low cost GPS sensor, the TIDGET, which is ideally suited for emergency location. This sensor was developed under the USAF contract for tracking radiosondes. Instead of tracking the GPS signals, the TIDGET sensor captures a brief \"snapshot\" of ray GPS sampled data and transmits this snapshot to the emergency dispatch center where the location of the motorist is computed. The central processing is aided by data from a map database when fewer than four satellites are in veiw of the sensor. The TIDGET requires no initialization or warm-up time since there is no processing of the data performed at the vehicle In large quantities, the TIDGET cost is less than $100 per unit, not including the cellular phone or other mobile communications link. Under this project, it is proposed to complete the TIDGET Mayday system architecture design and perform an initial in-vehicle demonstration of an emergency sensor. Anticipated Benefits: A reliable Mayday service will significantly increase highway safety, particularly in rural regions. The proposed TIDGET Mayday system architecture also permits value-added services to be provided to consumers through a public-private partnership. Commercial applications include AAA and tourist information services, stolen car recovery, and automatic vehicle location (AVL).",

These barriers normally consist of, for example CaF(2)/Si/Ca(2), A1(2)O(3)/Si/A1(2)O(3) or SiO(2)/Si/SiO(2). Our emphasis is on a SiO(2)/Si/SiO(2) SLS-B as a superlattice barrier for Si quantum wells. The proposed work involves the development of a deposition system for the demonstration of device potential consisting of the SLS-B, as well as the fabrication of actual quantum transistors such as the field effect transistor, the bipolar transistor, as the follow up goal of this work.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Thermal conductivity of diamond can be greatly improved by reducing the (12)C and (13)C initiated phonon collisions. Removal of (13)C isotope from CH(4) in the Arc-jet CVD produced diamond would drastically improve the thermal management in devices ranging from the nose-cones of missiles to multichip modules. Isotope enrichment of (12)C, or the removal of (13)C, uses a chemical diffusion process (distillation), resulting in a cost of (13)C or (12)C or (18)O of about $100/g. The proposed Garden Hose Gaseous Enrichment method would reduce the cost of these stable isotopes by a factor of 10 or more, and thereby open up the large scale industrial applications for these stable isotopes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         New, molecular heavy metal cluster immunoprobes will be prepared with platinum and palladium clusters 1.8 and 2.4 nm in diameter covalently conjugated to antibodies to give immunoelectron microscopy probes. Multiple gold cluster complexes will also be combined in a single larger label, up to 5 nm in diameter, using starburst dendrimer molecules as carriers for undecagold and a larger 1.4 nm gold cluster complex. Syntheses are proposed for new dendrimers based on adamantylic initiator cores and chain branching monomers and rigid rod spacers; these will be also be used as single-label carriers for multiple gold clusters. The resulting probes should combine the ease of visibility of larger colloidal gold particles with high sensitivity, low non-specific protein affinity, no aggregation or label dissociation, and penetration up to 30 microns into cells and tissue sections. New multiple gold cluster probes used with silver enhancement in antigen detection blots should demonstrate unprecedented sensitivities; we possibly should use an order of magnitude or more higher than current chemiluminescence methods. New dendrimers are proposed which incorporate gold clusters into the constituent monomers; these will be used as precisely defined immunoprobe labels up to 10 nm in diameter, and will also be studied as potential precursors to new classes of materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose to develop a low power image encoder based on vector quantization and active-pixel-sensor technology for real-time video, data compression. The hardware incorporates a novel pipelined architecture with intraframe and interframe block codings for significant bit-rate reduction and low-power operation. The intraframe coder utilizes vector quantization (VQ) for a low-loss video compression at 0.5 bit/pixel rate. The interframe coder employs an adaptive index replenishment scheme for further bit-rate reduction. Two candidate VQ architectures are proposed: (1) a full search VQ for a fully parallel, analog implementation with very low power dissipation and low chip count; (2) a tree search VQ for a pipelined, digital implementation with high configurability and low power operation. Active pixel sensor (APS) technology will be used to produce a low power, high resolution imager with on-chip pixel block formatting capability. In Phase 1, we optimize VQ architectures, perform preliminary design of an image encoder based on the selected VQ architecture, and develop APS devices for a Phase 2 hardware prototype development and demonstration.",

Phase I will examine the new IR&D; design of a stable laser oscillator (STALO) to determine its ability meet the revised stability requirement of 20 Hz over 1 msec. The impact of this new design on overall system parameters i.e. size, weight, and volume will be assessed. Current laboratory equipment has demonstrated 100 watts at less than 100 lbs. and a volume of 2 ft. 3 all of which presently meet the remaining requirements for the SBIR. Phase I will also examine methods of providing accurate pointing and tracking for the LADAR equipment. Standoff ranges (> 50 nmi) impose stringent requirements for such. Existing facilities and equipments will be investigated to determine feasibility of interfacing the LADAR equipment to achieve required performance for the ground-to-air demonstration. The design of these equipments will be such that they can be incorporated into aircraft for subsequent Phase III development by the Navy. Issues of standoff ranges against airborne targets will be assessed as to their impact on the design of a stable oscillator laser power output and optical aperture. Modifications to existing equipments will be defined in Phase I for implementation during Phase II. Phase II will demonstrate the capability of a LADAR to perform standoff against aircraft type targets.",

For the Phase I effort, a simple, but realistic model weather problem will be implemented on a parallel computer. The goal of the proposed research is to demonstrate the feasibility of using massively parallel processing techniques to gain significant computational efficiencies for typical calculations performed in mesoscale numerical weather prediction models. If the Phase I research is successful, a complete, operational mesoscale weather model will be ported to a parallel computer in a Phase II effort. The increased computational performance using parallel processing should permit the use of NWP codes in tactical operational environments, where CRAY-class supercomputers are not available. Greater computational efficiency may also permit the use of increased grid resolution in NWP models, thereby increasing their overall prediction accuracy and reducing the relience on parameterized quantities.",

We propose here to build on our recently successful demonstration of a superconducting circulator and extend this technology to miniature low-loss switching components. Such circulator based switches have unique advantages with respect to insertion loss and power handling capability compared to conventional integrated solid state circuit switches. By eventually integrating such miniature switching circulators, especially when realized in lumped element form, with other superconducting components major system advantages in satellite communications circuitry can be realized. For Phase I of this SBIR we propose to demonstrate the basic feasibility of a superconducting low-loss switchable circulator with good power handling capability. Beside its use in switching of filter banks and time delay shifting networks, it could also be an important component in various highly selective receivers (ELINT, COMINT, etc.). The initial feasibility demonstration of the HTS circulator switch is proposed to be performed at X-band, which permits straight-forward scaling to both higher and lower frequency bands of major interest for NASA.",

The Learning Optimal Control for Unmanned Supermaneuverable Technologies (LOCUST) system will team Neurodyne, Inc. and Sikorsky Aircraft in the utilization of neural network based system identification techniques and optimal control methods to rapidly learn changes in a vehicle's aerodynamic behavior and adapt to sudded meteorological effects while ensuring flight stability. The combined use of neural networks and nonlinear supermaneuverable flight control approaches will also utilize the nonlinear characteristics of the vehicle's dynamical response to increase maneuverability and thus increase survivability. In this effort, Neurodyne and Sikorsky will leverge current research programs in neural networks, nonlinear control, and UAV technology to ensure successful development of LOCUST. The investigators will further leverage in-house and commercially developed on-board sensors and processing techniques to increase both autonomy and range. LOCUST development will also benefit from the investigator's experience in research and development of neural network based reconfigurable flight control systems for the McDonnell F-15 aircraft and RC UAVs to ensure development of a cost-effective, robust adaptive control system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Older people in the U. S. receive most of their health care from primary care providers (internists, family or general practitioners). Consequently it is incumbent on them to differentially diagnose physical vs. emotional health problems. Depression in older persons presents particular challenges in this regard. Depression in the elderly is frequently masked as a somatic episode and much of it appears as comorbidity. While depression among elders is known to be prevalent, there are estimates that up to 90 per cent of it is \"missed\" during everyday clinical encounters. Physicians are often not well trained to recognize elder depression. Their practice settings may discourage its detection because it is time consuming and under-reimbursed. The overall goal is to develop an instructional videotape to sensitize internists, primary care physicians and family practitioners to the presence and subtleties of depression in their elderly patients in order to enhance their diagnostic skills. Tasks during Phase I will include: (a) developing (with a team of practicing psychiatrists and internists) the precise content areas of the video (e. g., somatized depression, comorbid depression, relationship to dementia, SDAT, etc.); (b) producing a script outline under the leadership of Ms. Carol Rainey (an award winning film producer at NERI); (c) review and written criticism of the script by an Advisory Committee; (d) revising the script on the basis of reviewers' recommendations; (e) developing a production schedule for early in Phase II. Phase II will involve the actual production and evaluation of the video in collaboration with the Division of General Internal Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine. The product at the end of Phase II will be an evaluated, state- of-the-science, educational videotape ready for mass production and distribution to internists, primarily providers, geriatricians, gerontologists, nurses and medical social workers during Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Active patient involvement in therapeutic decision making has been related to increased adherence to prescribed medical regimens and improved disease prognosis. Older patients, however, are less likely to assume an active role because they accept the physician as authority and, therefore, assume a passive role during the physician visit. The purpose is to develop and test an educational videotape to empower elders to take an active role as partners with physicians in their health care. The videotape is an educational tool that can provide realistic examples of partnership behaviors and techniques to improve elders' communications and satisfaction in health care encounters. Currently no videotape regarding this issue is commercially available. The aims of Phase I are to: 1) develop the content areas of the videotape; 2) produce a script for the 30-minute videotape; 3) develop a list of distribution outlets; and 4) arrange for the production of the videotape. Phase II activities will involve production of the videotape and a test of the videotape's effect on select patient behaviors. The final product at the end of Phase II will be the videotape kit with distribution through aging service organizations, health care providers and television broadcast outlets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         To determine the relative efficiencies of different interconnection technologies, we will compare optical interconnects using integrated optical waveguides and free-space with electronic interconnects, noting that the fabrication technology for waveguides and diffractive optical elements (used in free-space optical interconnects) are compatible with electronic manufacturing technology. Integrated optical waveguides are attractive because of higher bandwidth than electronic interconnects. Free-space interconnects appear to be even more attractive because the achievable connectivity is higher than waveguide interconnects. Free-space interconnects are especially suitable for global interconnection, since long distance connections are carried out optically in three dimensions, requiring less area. Using wavelength or orthogonal phase code multiplexing techniques, it will also be easier to reconfigure free-space interconnects for better fault tolerance. We propose to compare quantitatively optical interconnects using waveguides and free-space with electronic interconnects. We will determine the better interconnect technology between free-space and integrated optics. As an option to Phase I, we will produce a few key elements of the better technology. For Phase II, we will produce an optimized interconnect design and a scalable demonstration based on the proposed technology determined in Phase I. The demonstration will be a packaged, optically interconnected multichip module.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal deals with the development of an advanced life support testbed at the United Stated Antarctic Program's (USAP) Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. This test facility is currently being developed through the CELSS Antarctic Analog Program (CMP). The purpose of the CMP is to provide NASA with an operational facility through which the design of future space systems may evolve. The focus of this proposal is directed specifically towards the development of a regenerative power system capable of supporting the functions of the CAAP testbed. Experience derived from the design of the CMP facility has demonstrated that advanced life support system must be designed to leverage off of available power sources and thus are intimately coupled with power generation facilities and energy reuse techniques. In the Antarctic, just as would be the case in a Martian habitat, the long and costly logistics train imposes a prohibitive burden upon the operation of any recycling technologies. The use of in situ resources to supplement power generation requirements will greatly reduce the operational costs associated with this facility. In this proposal a 100 KW wind turbine will be designed for use at the South Pole. The development program will be focused on the identification and resolution of technical problems, specifically related to the polar environment. NPS will provide performance analysis, detailed engineering and conceptual designs which address the identified polar concerns. The outcome of the three phase SBIR program will be the development of a new line of 100 KW direct drive 208 VAC 3 Phase wind turbines designed specifically for cold region applications. These new turbines will fill a void in the current marketplace, and will make significant reductions in the cost of electrical energy in polar regions. In addition it is expected that this project will demonstrate the applicability of wind power for future NASA sponsored Mars missions",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We will commercialize a diagnostic spectrofluorimeter (DSF) for use by gastroenterologistsperforming endoscopic surveillance for colorectal dysplasia/carcinoma. The DSF will consist of acompact, special purpose spectrofluorimeter and a specially designed optical fiber diagnostic probe. Theprobe is passed through the biopsy channel of a standard colonoscope and brought into contact withthe colonic mucosa. The DSF will excite, collect and analyze mucosal autofluorescence to indicate thepresence of dysplasia. It will guide biopsy and enable real-time spectroscopic assessment of tissuesuspected of being dysplastic. Phase l will develop the prototype design of this unit. The specific aimsare to accomplish (l) subsystem optimization, (2) system optimization and (3) prototype design of anintegrated, compact, easy-to-use prototype unit which would be constructed and clinically tested in aPhase II effort. The program will employ background knowledge and technology developed at MIT underNIH support. Innovation in this project will come in areas of system optimization and engineering design.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Image analysis and graphics synthesis can be achieved with learning techniques using direct image examples without physically-based 3D models. We have developed novel techniques based on computer vision and on neural network algoritms: The mapping from novel images to a vector of \"pose\" and \"expression\" parameters can be learned from a small set of example images using a function approximation technique called an analysis network. The inverse mapping from input \"pose\" and \"expression\" parameters to output color images can be synthesized from a small set of exmaple images and used to produce new images under real-time control using a similar learning network, called in this case a synthesis network. The two networks rely on a) using a computer vision optical flow algorithm that matches corresponding pixels among pairs of grey-level images and effectively \"vectorizes\" them and b) exploiting a class of learning techniques that approximate the nonlinear mapping between the vector input and the vector output. We will design a real-time architecture implementing the two networks using software on a standard digital platform, enhanced by ASIC VLSI chips for the real-time computation of the optical flow and of the neural network mapping. Anticipated Benefits: The analysis and synthesis networks described here have several applications in computer graphics, special effects, interactive multimedia and object recognition systems. The analysis network can be regarded as a passice and trainable universal interface, that is a control device which may be used as a generalized computer mouse, instead of \"gloves\", \"body suits\" and joy sticks. THe synthesis network is an unconventional and novel approach to computer graphics. The two techniques together can be used for human-computer interfaces and interactive simulations that are model-based in a very unconventional way.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Nitrate contamination of ground water is a world wide problem.  Nitrate at 10 ppm Nitrate-N (EPA's MCL) is toxic to infants, and chronic exposure may be harmful to adults.  Physical and chemical nitrate removal methods only concentrate the pollutant, and bioremediation methods introduce other contaminants into the water.  In the Phase I stage of this project, The Nitrate Elimination Company, Inc. (NECi) proved the feasibility of utilizing electrically-driven immobilized enzymes, EzNET(TM), for point-of-use denitrification of potable water.  This process is fast and selective, and reduces nitrate to environmentally benign nitrogen gas thereby eliminating the pollutant from the environment, without introducing contaminants into the water.  In Phase II, NECi proposes to improve reactor design and optimize formulation of immobilized enzymes catalysts, and determine how to produce required quantities of the enzymes in a cost-effective manner.  A variety of electrode materials will be tested in the EzNET(TM) reactor, and large scale enzyme production methods will be developed.  Optimized prototypes will be tested for performance and stability.  Finally, design of an EzNET(TM) reactor suitable for commercial manufacture will be developed.  At the end of Phase II, project cost of the EzNET(TM) system relative to alternative nitrate removal methods will be known.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Tactical communications, as they currently exist, stress the available channel bandwidth to support the enormous amount of information that is communicated. To ase the burden on the communication channel, the amount of data being exchanged must be reduced. In speech communications, there iare many techniques implemented which compress a voice signal into a data stream; various speech encoding algorithms offer different advantages with respect to alternative performance cirteria. The proposed Adaptive Multi-Rate Vocoder (AMRAV) architecture allows dynamic selection of the best communication strategy from a list of predefined techniques; in certain scenarios in which the grade or rate of service can be controlled, the source coding strategy can be chosen automatically. The objective of the Phase I program is to refine the baseline set of candidate algorithms (presented in this proposal) and demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture by implementing a subset of the final AMRAV system to be constructed under the Phase II effort. A system breadboard will be constructed and tested during the Phase I effort to demonstrate the feasibility of the system. This will ideally position Nova for Phase II of this program which will culminate with the delivery of several AMRAVE engineering units.",

Microchannel plates (MCPs), very lightweight and relatively inexpensive lead glass wafers containing millions of well-aligned and regular microscopic channels having widths of about 10 microns, have recently demonstrated an impressive ability to collimate and focus soft X-rays. The innovation we propose will result in a highly accurate and reproducible process to change MCP channel alignment such that all channels remain normal to a spherical radius, with little or no channel distortion. This channel geometry will allow radiation from a point source to be collimated to a quasi-parallel beam with -5 mrad divergence or less, with enhanced field irradiance.

We view this approach as innovative since it will allow, for the first time, all of the relevant aspects of this thruster concept to be investigated in a single, self-consistent computational framework. There is no other available code which can include the geometries, field components, and physical models relevant to the SPT and similar applied-field Hall thrusters.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The recently discovered enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3- kinase) physically associates with and is phosphorylated by activated growth factor receptors and oncogenes which manifest protein-tyrosine kinase activity. It phosphorylates phosphatidylinositols specifically at the D-3-hydroxyl to produce the 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, 3-PPI, comprising phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, PI(3)P, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, PI(3,4)P2, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, PI(3,4,5)P3. Mutational studies of growth factor receptors and oncogenes have shown that the associated PI 3-kinase and its products PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 regulate cell growth and transformation. The 3-PPI are not physiological substrates for the PI-specific phospholipases C, and so the intact lipids have been suggested as novel critical second messengers of growth signals. Biochemical studies to determine the cellular targets of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, the metabolic fate of these lipids, and their roles in the cell cycle have been handicapped because well characterized 3-PPI samples are not readily available; there is no commercial source. These materials are needed as research probes for defining their biochemical and physiological roles. The materials may also be useful for developing new anticancer agents and applications in medical biotechnology. Practical synthetic methods for 3-PPI are not available. The overall objectives are to develop synthetic methods and analogues for the 3-PPI and to prepare and characterize these by physicochemical and spectro- metric techniques. A strategy based on total synthesis and partial synthesis as complementary approaches is suggested. During Phase I, the feasibility of these complementary approaches will be tested for the synthesis of PI(3,4,5)P3, and the product will be fully characterized by analytical, physicochemical and spectrometric measurements. In Phase II, these approaches will be adapted and extended for the syntheses of PI(3)P, PI3,4)P2, isomers and analogues.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Presently available electro-optic (E-0) materials are unsatisfactory for many applications due to their small E-0 coefficients and relatively large electroacoustic effect. Many other complex-oxide E-0 crystals show promise for providing substantial improvements in E-0 device performance. orders of magnitude reductions in drive voltage, power consumption, electroacoustic wave generation, and device size are expected by replacing LiNbO3 with materials having very large E-0 coefficients, such as SrxBal-xNb2O3- However, the difficulties associated with the bulk crystal growth of these high E-0 figures of merit complex- oxides have hampered their use in practical applications. Epitaxial vapor phase growth is an alternative approach to obtaining large area, high purity single-crystalline films. The recent advances in thin film deposition processes have opened an unprecedented opportunity to fully realize the potential of advanced complex-oxides. In this Phase I program, NZ Applied Technologies, in collaboration with Prof. E.L. Cross of Pennsylvania State University, will identify the most promising E-0 complex-oxide and demonstrate its thin film growth feasibility via an innovative plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) process. The thin film device structures having rigid substrates further restrain the electroacoustic wave generation. In Phase II, the fabrication process will be optimized, and the prototype devices will be produced. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Success in the Phase I effort will identify a viable fabrication route for advanced, compact Mach-Zehnder devices having a wide spectral range and low power requirements. Other commercial applications include the fabrication of spatial light modulators, matrix optical switches, and optical interconnections.",

The project objective is to determine the feasibility of developing a computer-aided expert system to generate job standards for low frequency, long-cycle work activities. To satisfy this objective, we will document the work measurement and job standards development process, identify alternative hardware/software solutions, design a system architecture, and document research results in a final report. When completed, this research effort will yield a suggested system architecture that, when developed, will result in a highly useful and flexible computer-aided tool to generate job standards. NASA will benefit from this tool by being able to rapidly develop reliable job standards for low-frequency, long-duration tasks. In addition to satisfying NASA's needs, the system will be generic and lend itself to many functions in the private and public sectors of the economy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         One of the major sources of pointing error in turreted weapon systems such as the Apache helicopter and the M1A1 tanks is the barrel vibration. This vibration is due to aggressive firing and high speed retargeting and maneuvering of the turret. Testbeds have been developed at U.S Army Research Laboratories to study various control algorithms for vibration suppression and pointing of these systems. In this SBIR effort, a two degrees-of-freedom adaptive (learning) control systemis proposed for vibration suppression and pointing purposes under aggressive firing and maneuvering. The approach is based on the Simultaneous Control and Motion Pattern Specific Optimal System Design (SCMPSOSD). Furthermore, a new piezoelectric ceramic actuator is proposed for added control and actuation. A prototype of the actuator will be developed and tested with the advocated control design. The Trajectory Pattern Method(TPM) based technique allows for optimal simultaneous control and structure design with optimal locations for the sensors and actuators. Through the two degrees-of-freedom architecture of the proposed control algorithm, high performance with an acceptable robustness property will be attained. Furthermore, the special architecture of the proposed control design is suitable as a low cost optimal performance digital control technology especially designed for precision fire-on-the-move applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The approach of Oncogene Science for the treatment of sickle cell anemia is to identify chemical compounds which elevate transcription of the human fetal globin gene and, thereby, prevent sickle cell anemia or beta-thalassem- ia. Sickle cell disease is an often crippling disease afflicting 1 in 400 Afro-Americans. The disease results from a glutamic acid to valine change at position 6 of the adult beta-globin gene (Hb to HbS) resulting in an irreversible deformation of red blood cells, hemolytic anemia, splenic atrophy and blood vessel occlusion. P-thalassemia is a common lethal disease in the Mediterranean basin and in Southeast Asia which results from abrogation of beta-globin gene expression. Genetic evidence suggests a 30-40% induction in gamma-globin gene expression should effectively treat sickle cell patients and obviate the need for transfusion of beta-thalassemia patients. We will engineer erythroid cell lines containing stably integrated DNA constructs which measure changes in gamma-globin gene expression in response to drug treatment. These lines will form the basis for both drug screening and for mechanistic follow-up of lead compounds.",

The methods are applicable to automated image analysis at high resolution so that very low levels of chromosome damage will be detectable. We will develop new methods for depositing lymphocytes on slides at high density, using centrifugal cytology. Methods are proposed to-decrease the error rate for FISH detection of target sequences, so that infrequent breakage events such as translocation can be quantitated. A new technique for fluorescent counterstaining of nuclei is to be developed, employing narrow-band emission reporters such as europium chelates and cyanine dyes. This project will contribute to our goal of labeling of chromosomes 1,2,3 of the human genome with three-color fluorescence painting probes to detect chromosome damage of these three chromosomes with automated instrumentation.",

This is due to the increasing sophistication of modern weapon systems, the nature of future conflicts (e.g. low-intensity, humanitary support, etc.) and the large volumes of imagery and other data now available to analysts and tactical decision makers. Civilian, tactical and national sensors are providing an increasing amount of data for processing and analysis. This data are increasingly critical for time-sensitive operations when the demands on humans in the loop are maximum. As weapons become more complex and tactical choices multiply, operational decision-makers will find in more difficult to deal with the increasing variety of input data that must be considered in selecting the optimum combination of weapons and tactics. Investigation, selection and development of advanced, innovative techniques for graphics rendering and visualization using massively parallel processors is needed to determine the feasibility and support the development of a Battlefield Visualization System (BVS). The proposed BVS will provide theater commanders and other users with advanced visualization and image exploitation tools. It will allow users to efficiently produce and utilize timely, highly accurate image analyses and visualizations tailored, simultaneously, for a wide variety of specialized end-users.",

Light generated by a diode laser pumped tunable Cr:LiSAF laser is Raman shifted twice in Hydrogen to nicely cover the 205 micron window. The unique feature of the proposed laser is that the Raman shifting cell and optics are placed inside the pump laser cavity. As a result sufficient gain and interaction length are obtained even at the lower powers available from diode pumping. The intercavity Raman cell uses two focusing mirrors to contain the first Stokes and partially contain the second Stokes beam. This approach benefits from the high intensities inside the laser cavity and by effectively increasing the Raman interaction lenth by the Q of the shifting cavity. If the cavity is properly designed the second Stokes beam will grow from four wave mixing. The work proposed here will investigate several of the issues related to phase matching of the four wave mixing process. The results will be combined with an optical design study for a prototype design to be fabricated in Phase II.",

This combination has the potential for producing a wind and wind shear profiling lidar which is optically simple enough to be routinely used in the field. The lidar uses the recently developed high power master-oscillator power-amplifier diode laser which can function for several thousand hours without failure. Doppler frequency shifts are measured using the incoherent edge technique which is tolerant of laser frequency drift and laser speckle. These problems plague coherent Doppler lidar. OPHIR corporation has recently demonstrated reliable operation of an airborne RM-CW lidar and is currently developing an airborne edge detection Doppler lidar. Combining these two techniques has the potential for providing a relatively simple solution to the long standing problem of continuous monitoring for clear air turbulence. The proposed Phase I effort will further investigate the lidar sensitivity and detection range. Instrumentation for processing lidar data and maintaining alignment through computer control using sensor feedback. This unique lidar combination is explicitly requested in the SBIR solicitation subtopic for wind field and wind shear measurement.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Solicitation AF 94-038 requires the development of innovative concepts to enhance the performance, availability and affordability of C3I systems and subsystems. OptiComp Corporation proposes to develop a high speed photonic switching architecture by exploiting its enabling \"Smart\" GaAs optoelectronic interconnect technology. This implementation will allow data transmission with addressing (or routing) to be performed in a single stage. A prototype architecture will provide a high speed inter-module interconnect without the power requirements and cross-talk limitations of electronic circuitry. Specifically three objectives will be accomplished during Phase I. Initially, an 8 x 8 element, optoelectronic fast packet, switching array suitable for ATM controller test bed development will be designed. Subsequently, an optical multiplex (MUX) architecture based on global (multidimensional) \"Smart\" GaAs optoelectronic interconnect technology will be developed as a predecessor to crossbar technology. A system layout of a 3:8 data router operating at 1O MHz will then be demonstrated in the laboratory. Multi-element arrays of DANE \"Smart\" pixels will provide the required packet switching and controlling functions within the ATM protocol. \"DANE\" refers to the GaAs \"Smart\" pixel which (1) detects light, (2) amplifies the result, (3) negates the result (inversion) and (4) emits the resultant Boolean value through the output laser. Diffractive optical interconnect elements (DOIEs) provide the signal routing for the decoder by selectively imaging, in free space, each element on the DANE's laser diode array to predetermined positions on the next DANE detector plane.",

These optical interconnections will require hybrid packaging of optical, electronic, and optoelectronic devices in optoelectronic multichip modules (OEMCMs). Major challenges in OEMCMs involve achieving optical interconnection of various devices within the OEMCM, and specifically achieving low coupling losses through mode matching and very precise positioning of devices. We propose development of OEMCMs based on the use of a silicon substrate for mounting of all devices, and offer these innovations: (1) use of planar tapered waveguides to achieve mode matching complex connectivity (e.g., optical signal splitting and combining) between devices within the OEMCM, (2) novel structures for combining planar tapered waveguides with semiconductor devices, and (3) advanced structures and techniques for mounting the various devices to the substrate. We will examine performance, manufacturing issues, and process compatibility of all components. The proposed innovations will allow the development of OEMCMs with passive positioning of all devices, which are manufacturable at low cost with high yield and realiability. These OEMSMs will be applicable to a wide variety of communications and computing systems.

Key to the approach is the use of a frequency discriminator based on the zero phase point of the anomalous dispersion curve of a gas absorption line (in this case CO2). This phase is measured, without the need of any frequency dither, through use of an ultra stable interferometeric phase without being affected by laser intensity noise. The technique can also be adapted to any laser wavelength presently commercially available or future ones under development. The design will be compact and require little electrical power, likely less than 1 watt and which includes that required for a TE cooler/heater to maintain the operating point of the laser diode. The device will produce more than 1 mWatt of optical power from a single mode polarization preserving optical fiber.",

A two-tiered translation stage is also proposed which, when coupled with the metrology system, will enhance SPM lateral precision and resolution to the 10 nm level at a scan velocity of 1 mm/sec. The proposed positioning system will be capable of slew rates approaching 1 meter/sec and will provide a range of motion of several square centimeters.

THE PROPOSED DEVICE USES A CHARGE TRANSFER PLATE (CTP) TO TRANSFER MODULATION VOLTAGES FROM THE VLSI CIRCUIT TO THE POLYMER LIGHT MODULATION ELEMENT AND TO PROVIDE AN OPTICALLY FLAT SUBSTRATE FOR THE POLYMER ALIGNMENT LAYER.

The key concepts involved are: premixing the propellants prior to injection, and a thermally choked chamber which allows using a chamberless throat and skirt for the combustion/expansion process. The problem areas on small thrusters are: (1) inefficient long-term storage of propellants which has led to common use of storable propellants in spite of their lower performance and the contamination produced by the exhaust plume; (2) chamber cooling because of the high surface to volume ratio of the chamber, which has resulted in resorting to very high rates of film cooling which reduces performance further and increases plume contamination; (3) difficulty with injection and mixing because of the small orifice sizes, and effects of the nearby wall, which has led to problems of chamber wall streaking and pitting, reduced performance and shortened chamber life; and (4) precision of start and stop thrust curves and precision of impulse for short pulses, which makes the controllability of space vehicles more complex, and is particularly severe when doking maneuvers are involved. The innovations proposed define a thruster which effectively resolves many of these problems in a single compact, low-cost assembly.",

In current approaches, turbulence-induced instability imposes limits in levitator effectiveness and limits the sample dimension capacity. With the implementation of ALAS, position instability will be reduced by closed-loop active control of sample position within the suspension flow. Current 1-g aerodynamic levitation schemes rely on passive stability enhancement via geometric constraints or continuous operation of acoustic standing waves. The proposed levitator will operate with real-time sample position tracking. Vertical position control (levitation) will be provided by an external gas supply flowing through a flow nozzle or a high output sonic pump. Inert or reactive gases, with or without preheating, can be used for convective cooling or heating of the sample. Levitator gas flow rate will be adjusted by a computer controlled tunable micro-valve. Lateral position stability feedback will be provided by rectified gas jet generators \"sonic pumps\". The work described herein will utilize existing laboratory hardware and position control technology being developed for microgravity materials processing applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In analysis of basebanded Doppler radar signals, it has been noted that trained operators can classify target types by aural analysis of the baseband signals. This implies that there is sufficient structure in the signal so that automated analysis using speech processing techniques can perform classification. Standard analysis techniques assume that the data is stationary and well modeled using Fourier transformations of the data. The resulting spectrum is used to determine signal components that are then used for classification. Unfortunately, the audio signals of interest are highly nonstationary and can even contain sequences of pulses. The standard Fourier spectral analysis techniques cannot determine the time-varying structure wihtin the data and thus do not provide sufficient features for classification. It is this time-varying strucyure that gives the operator the clues he needs for classification. ORINCON proposes to develop and demonstrate an automated system that uses high-resolution time/frequency representations to characterize the data. The feature extractor is coupled with a neural network to solve the classification problems. Neural networks have been used extensivvely and successfully at ORICON to solve detection/classification problems in underwater acoustics, as well as for fault detection/classification problems in rotating machinery. This technology is directly aplicable to the classification problem for baseband Doppler radar return signals.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The mission of passive undersea surveillance is to classify potential threats by examining the acoustic signatures of detected sources. Current methods are based on visual examination and operator translation of the acoustic scene. With the ongoing reduction in Navy personnel, an automated system requiring minimal operator interaction with improved classification capabilities will be needed to support current and future automated surveillance requirements. In the past many attempts have been made to develop and automated classification system. These systems generally failed, primarily due to lack of acoustic expert involvement in the development of these classification systems. Additionally, front-end processors were inappropriately designed and did not provide information required by the classifier to produce high-confidence results. ORINCON has successfully developed and demonstrated prototype automated undersea surveillance systems utilizing expert processors on both SPAWAR and DARPA programs, such as the Automated Surveillance Information Processing Systems (ASIPS) and the 7100 Site Evaluation System. In Phase I we will apply our extensive experience in developing automated detection and classification systems to design an information processor (IP) and utilize in-house experts to develop the associated rulebases required to perform automated classification. In Phase II, a prototype system will be developed to demonstrate this concept.",

The recent advent of broadband communication services has dramatically increased this demand. The opportunity exists to merge two of the most promising advances in cornmunications: acoustic charge transport (ACT) devices and neural networks. ACT devices are available that implement a 128 tap programmable transversal filter operating at 360 MHz on a chip measuring less than 25 square millimiters. Although these devices provide wideband communications signal processing, they are limited to linear operation. It is possible to use these devices to configure neural networks that perform nonlinear filtering operations. Neural network filtering operations for adaptive equalization and signal detection have consistently shown at least a 3dB performance improvement over their linear counterparts. This project will design, implement, test, and analyze an ACT-based implementation of a neural network for communications applications. The resulting ACT-based neural network implementation provides almost an order of magnitude improvement over the faster commercially available neural network devices available today.",

This normally requires an anechoic chamber or other environment that results in acceptably low acoustic reflection or scattering back into the volume of interest. ORINCON proposes an approach that confines sections of planar acoustic waves within a section of a waveguide enclosing the test volume. The plane waves will be created by a specially developed plane wave source at one end. The plane wave source will be carefully designed to minimize evanescent waves and excitation of modes other than the plane wave mode in the wave guide above its cutoff frequency. The far end of the enclosure will be terminated by an acoustically active sound control transducer or array to suppress reflection or diffraction of sound back into the enclosure and to suppress evanescent waves created by the acoustic impedance mismatch between the wave guide and the room at low frequencies. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - This device will be useful for calibration and measurement of directional response patterns of microphones over a broad frequency range. It may also be applicable to testing techniques for active cancellation of acoustic scattering from small objects, or from small-scale models of larger objects.",

New models of active biosonar signal analysis based on bat-like target range profiling and dolphin-like image construction have shown the potential to eliminate or significantly reduce these problems.

The team combines extensive signal processing, active sonar, biosonar, neural network, and VLSI experience. The specific aims of our proposed Phase I research are: (1) implementation of a number of biologically motivated algorithms, (2) preparation of a number of data sets for use in algorithm comparisons, (3) evaluation of the performance of the various algorithms, (4) selection of the best algorithm, and (5) performance of a feasibility analysis for a VLSI implementation.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The treatment of the waste by-products of electronics manufacturing is raising increasingly important issues. Of particular concern is contaminated waste water resulting from the stripping, etching, plating, and washing operations in printed circuit board fabrication. Waste treatment has proven to be an expensive and cumbersome solution which has not completely solved the problem. In order to achieve significant reductions in harmful waste geneation and emissions, electronics manufacturers should employ materials and process which are intrinsically waste-free so that there is no waste that has to be treated or disposed. Ideally, a new process for the production and assembly of printed circuits would completely eliminate waste-water from the manufacturing process. This proposal entails the adoption of additive printed circuitry by means of dry printing of solderable electrically conductive inks. To do so, new processes and equipment which do not exist today will have to be developed and demonstrated. The objectives of Phase I will be to prove the principle of waste-water free fabrication of state of the art multilayer printed circuit structures with conductive inks by employing a printed through hole, a sequential printing process for multilayer with adequate planarization, and produce fine lines using photoimagable dielectrics. Anticipated Benefits: Anticipate that this work will successfully lead to the development of environmentally safe processes for the fabrication of multilayer printed circuits and multi-chip modules. These materials will enable the fabrication of printed circuits with no generation of waste-water streams of any kind.

Simulation will require the use of microgravity furnaces that can be used either on KC 135 runs or in the space station. Since these furnaces have to be lightweight and heated to high temperatures, joints for these furnaces will need to be strong and capable of withstanding the repeated thermal cycling. Aluminum oxide-to-graphite joints are desired in many applications involving insulators and specifically in high temperature furnaces to be used in the gas grain simulation facility. The proposed Phase I effort will focus on the formation of high-temperature (>1000C) joints between aluminum oxide and graphite that are necessary to provide reliable electrical and thermal performance.",

This work is worthy of support under the stated criteria for developing new and innovative ideas for improvement of today's technology in the areas of infrared seekers and sensor fusion because it is truly innovative. Biological sensors provide technically rich example for us to use in the development of devices which are more efficient with respect to sensitivity, data throughput and post-detection processing of recovered image data. This project proposes an effort which will accomplish a preliminary design for a sensor which extends the previous work that we hve done in the development of the neuromorphic focal plan device. The resulting body of work will provide a solid technical basis for the development of an actual device in a Phase I and Phase II that will help further refine design issues in preparation for the hardware development. Devices which mimic biological counterparts are more efficient than conventional sensors in many ways. To a large degree, they process information directly on-plane, reducing the computational load of off-plane processing resources. The ever-increasing pixel count of currently-available devices generates a tremendous quantity of data which must b handled by off-plane processors. Biological systems do pre-processing of the data to reduce the amount of transmitted data to a level which may be handled by reasonably-sized processors. The data that they deliver has been pre-filtered with respect to spatial and temporal requirements of follow-on devices. they operate to a large extent in the real-time analog domain, so their power dissipation is orers of magnitudes lower than conventional systems would require to perform the same computational tasks. commercial devices developed based upon these new devices will be smaller, lighter run faster, and will be cheaper to manufacture than currently-available infrared instrumentation.",

We will identify the key growth and processing technology development and implementation issues for the TGS growth, characterization and device fabrication processes. We will test the feasibility of the TGS process for the growth of GaN. In Phase II, we will design, build and operate a custom TGS growth system that will encompass the technology developments and improvements highlighted in the Phase I plan. We will demonstrate and optimize the TGS growth and characterization of GaN crystals. Several GaN wafers will be tested for high temperature device performance. Reproducible growth of bulk GaN with superior device performance will prove essential for successful Phase III commercialization.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Vertical Line Arrays (VLAs) have the potential of significantly improving the performance of underwater acoustic systems in shallow water scenarios. Realizing this improved performance in a low storage volume, cost effective system is dependent on an Integrated Hydrodynamic Deployment System which ensures optimal acoustic performance of the Navy's VLA. Creare proposes to develop such a system which will provide for constant and optimal VLA configuration over the range of operational conditions. Specifically, Creare's system will utilize a Buoyant Lifting Body (BLB) with a faired VLA. The BLB will provide a vertical tension force on the VLA which increases with current speed resulting in a constant lift-to-drag-ratio and a constant array configuration, for the range of currents. For optimal survivability, the BLB will be inflated with ployurethane foam. Creare's integrated approach to VLA deployment sytem hydrodynamics in synergy with the Navy's acoustic sensor package will allow the superior performance of VLA acoustic sensors to be realized in shallow water scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Aircraft which travel at high Mach numbers require a very large internal heat sink to protect the engine and airframe from high heat loads. Endothermic fuels are attractive for hypersonic propulsion systems because they increase the fuel heat sink capacity. We propose to develop a compact and lightweight heat exchanger/reactor in which cooling is provided by the catalyzed decomposition of the endothermic fuel. The innovation is a heat exchanger configuration which enables efficient decomposition of the fuel within a very small volume, resulting in an order of magnitude reduction in the size and a factor of three reduction in weight of the reactor. There are three key advantages to the proposed heat exchanger: small size and weight, increased reliability due to a simplified internal configuration, and low pressure drops for air cooling applications. Preheating of the fuel occurs within the same compact unit. The objectives of Phase I are to prove the feasibility by demonstrating fabrication and sealing techniques and to assess the benefits to hypersonic propulsion systems. In Phase II we will build and demonstrate a prototypical reactor/heat exchanger and perform tests to provide data for design and optimization of hypersonic propulsion systems.",

In the gas turbine, heat is transferred from the burning of R.D.F., to the inlet of the primary combustor through an innovative kind of heat exchanger, a modular regenerator.

The innovation is the use of cryogenic liquefied air stored in a \"phase separator\". The phase separator provides a constant oxygen fraction to the user, allows the respirator to operate in any orientation, and allows the use of liquefied air instead of pure liquid oxygen in a cryogenic air supply. The phase separator is the key innovation which enables the proposed SCBA to surpass conventional cryogenic SCBAs and meet the same standards as compressed air tanks.

Improved processes for manufacturing these components at reasonable costs are required to exploit recent advances in MMW technology. In this project we will develop and demonstrate an innovative superplastic forming (SPF) production process for the lost cost fabrication of MMW planar waveguide assemblies. We expect the process to realize superior feature definition, sharp corners, and tight tolerances and be well suited to high volume production applications. In Phase I we will develop the critical process parameters and demonstrate feasibility of our innovative process by fabricating a number of test pieces suitable for measuring feature definition, tolerances, and surface finishes. A comprehensive producibility analysis will be prepared based on the results of these experiments. In Phase II we will develop the detailed production processes and component design guidelines, and establish a pilot production capability. Commercialization of this technology, either through a spin-off company or through licensing, will occur in Phase III.",

This will be achieved by collecting a large number of critical incidents from Air Force aircrews reflecting effective, ineffective, and average levels of individual CRM performance. In addition, because it is the performance of an entire aircrew that results in flight safety and effective mission performance, we will explore the usefulness of collecting critical incidents of team or aircrew performance. Once we have collected these CRM-related critical incidents, an important step will be the \"retranslation\" of these incidents in order to obtain information about their effectiveness and the dimensions that underlie performance in the CRM parts of aircrew jobs. Finally, in order to more clearly demonstrate the usefulness of these critical incidents for developing CRM training tools, we will develop a behavior-based rating scale targeted at one of the CRM performance dimensions identified as part of the critical incident analysis. A set of such rating scales could be used to measure performance before, during, and after training, and thus would be useful both for training needs assessment and for training evaluation.",

A modified GenetiScanner robotic microscope with 60 slide capacity will analyze the interphase cells, tabulating the incidence of chromosome breakage and translocations on previously unattainably large numbers of cells. Statistical analysis, using large sample size, will yield usable estimates of the chromosome breakage rate for low radiation doses. This will directly support NASA's upcoming Shuttle/MIRS 90-day missions that will study space flight-induced genetic damage and the effectiveness of radioprotectants.",

Commercially available CDROM sources provide hundreds of megabytes of source code for as little as $35. Identifying and extracting reusable code modules for incorporation into an existing code library system from such enormous collections can be a daunting task. We are proposing the development of a Software Information Mining Tool which can analyze large collections of software utilizing vector-space and latent demantic analysis approaches to text retrieval. Unlike previouslu proposed systems, the proposed tool will focus on the problem of latent semantic analysis of free-form text embedded in the source code itself, augmented by a heuristic analysis of the structure of the collection.",

The system will also be used (and tested) in support of topographic measurements of the earth from NASA's high altitude aircraft which incorporate autonomous laser altimetry. Sub arc second measurement of a spacecraft's attitude will be accomplished in near real time through use of a star tracker which utilizes a CCD array sensor and array processing techniques to locate and identify 10 to 20 stars per image. A unique parameterization and error minimization for multi-star celestial attitude determination will provide for increased attitude precision compared to present star trackers. The algorithm will also be self-correcting for temperature related changes in the star sensor system (primarily focal length changes) and provide correction for residual distortions in the optical system. The final system will provide a compact, rugged, cost-effective solution to spacecraft and aircraft laser altimeter attitude determination.",

Increasingly complex waveforms covering large spectral band-widths are now being used. In addition, the number of active emitters has increased dramatically. Coupled with this rapidly rising processing load is the use of techniques designed to counter the signal database identification process; for example intentionally increasing the parameter limits of the emitter or changing one or more of the emitter operating parameters. Clearly new signal processing techniques are needed for both emitter detection and identification. Our approach addresses both of these problems with an optical signal processor/receiver for emitter detection and angle-of-arrival determination followed by a neural network uses a unique classifier scheme already proven to work well in EW pulse classifier applications, and optical emitter detection and identification applications.",

The arrays are based on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL). Unlike conventional diode lasers, VCSELs emit low-divergence, circularly-symmetric beams which are free from astigmatism and ideally suited for imaging applications. The targeted configuration is an array of VCSELs, each with a different wavelength, which are efficiently combined and fed through an optical fiber into a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO). Our design maintains constant alignment of the source with no moving parts and allows rapid, programmable electronic switching between the lasers. We have several goals for Phase I: 1) produce VCSELs to be used in a SLO to demonstrate their suitability, 2) evaluate the performance of the VCSEL- equipped SLO, 3) determine the extent of wavelength variation which is feasible for a single chip, 4) investigate techniques for mounting and aligning multiple laser chips on a common substrate, 5) determine the optimal means for combining the beams, 6) survey the range of other medical imaging applications and requirements for similar arrays, and 7) report our results and plan construction and implementation of the wavelength-multiplexed source array for Phase II.",

Phase I effort will involve integrating POC\\'s recent advances in stabilizing poled X(2) polymer with an ultra high speed (> 5 GHz) optical modulator in a monolithic multilayer structure consisting of surface plasmon wave polarization resonant coupling. Although the poled organic polymer in the thin film configuration (which is consistent with POC\\'s patented modulator) offers many advantages over photorefractive crystals including a large ED coefficient and low dielectric constant, the decay of the ED coefficient due to relaxation is a serious problem. In fact, this is exactly the issue POC intends to address in Phase I, based on its ongoing efforts involving crosslinking and optimized processing. POC will work closely with Jeff Lindsay of the Naval Weapons Center, China Lake and Prof. Sukant Tripathy of the University of Lowell, MA. During Phase II, we will optimize the material results of Phase I and produce EO plasma modulators to be integrated with fielded Navy systems. .",

The processor is based on a two-step optical technique: A coarse-search step and a fine-search step. The coarse-search optical processor can compare the input pattern with the key features of an entire template data bank in one pass of light transmission and provide most likely addresses to the data bank for accessing possible matching patterns. These possible matching patterns will then be fed into the fine-search optical processor for a thorough comparison. The advantage of this two-step processing is its intellegence--the system does not have to exhaustively search the entire data bank. POC further proposes a unique technological development in each step of the SAR N6 interconnectability, represents a technology beyond the state of the art in coarse-search processing. A distributed-array processing technique will be explored in the fine-search processor for increased throughput and dynamic range.",

The optical processors will be clonable, but like humans, they can evolve differently, depending on what characteristics are needed for individual applications.

In order to provide even more accurate diagnoses, we will develop an autostereo fiberscope (ASF) for real-time 3-D monitoring of cancerous tumors, in vivo, without the need for open surgery. The ASF device is based on POC's autostereoscopic 3-D display technology, combined with medically accepted silica based imagefiber for disposable ultra thin fiberscopes (such an angioscopes, urethral scopes, etc.). The novelty of POC's ASF device is in its combination of ultra thin fiberscopes with the company's proprietary passive autostereoscopic 3-D displays. As a result, POC's display, combined with a pair of image fibers that have already been partially medically verified, provides a relatively low-cost disposable device with fully developed unmatchable 3-D perception. The core component of this system is POC's holographic 3-D display screen that looks like a regular movie projection diffusion screen and has no bothersome elements that could distract from human 3-D perception. POC's 3-D visualization is very persuasive, and it has already been successfully presented in an experimental demonstration.",

We will develop special holographic noise suppressing coatings, which are analogous to moth-eye structures. These coatings are versatile and can be applied to almost any internal part of an optical detection system. They provide noise suppressing capabilities which will improve the detection sensitivity of tumor tissue by a factor of 10. A further benefit of moth-eye surface relief structures is their enormous surface area while maintaining excellent optical properties. Moth-eye films are low bulk and may be incinerated. We expect that excellent optical properties will be preserved after depositing samples on top of the moth-eye film. As a result of this development, new detection systems which are more compact and user friendly can be implemented in a medical environment.",

These sensors, which can have characteristic dimensions much smaller than lmicromole, have the potential for monitoring ionic concentrations, enzyme levels, drug concentrations,and a wide variety of other intracellular chemical properties, with relative ease to the researcher. In theproposed approach, chemically sensitive indicators would be immobilized by photopolymerization at thetip of finely tapered optical fibers similar to those used in Near-field Scanning Optical Microscopy(NSOM). The technique could thus combine the ultrafine resolution of NSOM with the sensitivity andspecificity of active fiber optic chemical sensors. These sensors offer significant advantages, includingfaster response time and minimization of cellular damage, when compared with existing (electrochemical)intracellular sensors. During Phase I of the project, POC will demonstrate the practicality of thistechnique by fabricating and testing sensors capable of measuring intracellular concentrations ofmetabolites, ions, or other chemical species of biological interest. Phase II will see expansion into themeasurement of other analytes, including biochemical substances such as enzymes and immunochemica-ls, as well as the development of a portable system capable of serving as the basis for a line ofcommercial intracellular sensing products.",

The technology is used to perform multiplexed data-switching based on a spectral/spatial fiber optic switching technique.

This design is based on three of POC's existing technologies: coherently-coupled (phase synchronized) HFPFs, tunable liquid-crystal cell preparation, and fabrication of high-efficiency controlled-bandwidth holographic mirrors in the UV to the IR regions of the spectrum, using a high-order harmonic recording technique and a proprietary photopolymer processing technique. The ENCHART filter will exhibit extremely high (0.1 angstrom) resolution with fine tuning over a range of at least 3 angstroms in a selected range of the spectrum ( from UV to IR), high out-of-band rejection (OD > 2) with adequate suppression across an operating range 1000 times broader than that passband, and superior performance under harsh operating conditions. The ENCHART filter will be lightweight, small-size, and inexpensive.",

These data, however, are in a 2-D format and cannot be used to construct real 3-D images. NASA has stated a need for electronic methods and equipment to capture and store digital 3-D data in a holographic format. This equipment should then be able to reconstruct the hologram and project it as a 3-D image. In response to this need, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop an innovative electronic holographic data capture, storage, and display system. There are two major innovations involved in this system: 1) A real-time fast switching optical sensor medium with an efficient high resolution holographic electronic data transfer panel for both holographic recording and reconstruction, and 2) a time sequential approach with optical interconnect routing to convert high resolution (optical) data to a digital form. The system will consist of a single high resolution CCD camera, a standard personal computer, and a data storage system. The Phase I program will provide a preliminary system design, and a proof-of-concept prototype.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A totally new class of guided-wave MMW antenna is proposed. The antenna's beamsteering and beamforming capabilities are based on light-induced grating coupler. The waveguide antenna is made of a semiconductor. A grating pattern is imposed on the waveguide by illumination with light through a spatial light modulator. The grating pattern can be rapidly rewritten by light alone, performing radar functions and offering a simple substitute for a phased-array antenna. Physical Optics Corporation's R&D; Division (POC R&D;) has already demonstrated theoretically and experimentally the semiconductor's ability to change the direction of a propagated MMW by diffraction off a light-induced grating. Extending this principle to the guided-wave antenna, POC will design and fabricate a receiver antenna prototype with a detector integrated onto the waveguide. Such an integrated, compact antenna which requires no phase-shifting elements is especially valuable for seeker applications. Moreover, using FaAs as a waveguide material opens a prospect for mass production MMIC technology. The laboratory prototype of the guided-wave antenna induced by light (GAIL) demonstrated at the end of the Phase I project will prove the viability of the proposed new approach.",

The system will comprise ultiple wavelength light sources emitting in the ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared ranges, optical detectors and a neural-network-based signal processing unit. It will allow physicians to objectively evaluate injured individuals, determine the burn depth and the structure of viable dermis and subcutaneous tissue, quanitfy the burn surface area and monitor healing. Using the same technqiue, the proposed neural-network-based system can be designed to monitor the vital signs of neonatal cerebral oxygenation, blood perfusion, kidney failure, and myocardial infarction. Since the proposed system is portable and operates in real-time, it can be carried by a person on the battlefield or to an emergency accident site to provide automatic diagnosis. Resulsts are produced in digital form, ready for transfer to a central command station. Application in the civilian sector would improve the delivery of emergency care, thereby reducing hospitalization time and health care costs. Physical Optics Corporation and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center have formed a uniquely qualified research team for the development of this biomedical sensor. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed ultraviolet, visible, and near-IR spectroscopy technology can be used widely in trauma care, under both military and civilian scenarious, to characterize biological tissues, tissue pH level, blood perfusion, oxygenation and arterial blood gas levels, and the anatomical structure of teeth. The neural network technology will provide reliable and sensitive identification of abnormal conditions.",

The POC proposed sensor detects minute changes in the refractive index of sweat induced by the varying lactate concentration in sweat. The proposed device is truly noninvasive, can monitor the person without compromising mobility and without interfering with normal bodily functions, yet is capable of transmitting real time data about the person's vital body chemistry. The highly compact fiber optic sensor can be embedded in weapons and/or other hardware handled by the soldier in the field, and can continuously monitor a soldier's vital body chemistry. The inherent low cost and ruggedness of the proposed miniature fiber optic sensor would allow it to be readily integrated into a wireless network which can provide a central command station with real time data about all sensor equipped soldiers in the field without the sensor requiring any action from the wearer to activate. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The anticipated commercial (non-military) benefits of the POC proposed device are: (i) law enforcement: police officers in the field will have the advantage of having real time monitoring of their anaerobic metabolism so that help can immediately be dispatched if an officer's physiological health is temporarily compromised; (ii) emergency medical assistance: emergency medical technicians responding to a potentially like threatening situation can immediately assess the seriousness of the person's physiological condition.",

These inspections are subject to many sources of error and uncertainty, making the experience of the inspector a critical factor in the quality of the result. Current economics pressures to improve competitiveness and efficiency exist throughout the aerospace industry. Improved inspection techniques are needed in order to eliminate unnecessary equipment teardowns and yet protect safety margins while making better use of scarce inspection expertise. We propose to develop an instrument which will present to the inspector an accurate three dimensional view of the surface under inspection. This instrument will eliminate uncertainties about the precise size of surface defects, making inspections quicker and more accurate. The instrument will use the technology of non- contact optical surface contouring; here applied for the first time to an application which is so dominated by practical difficulties. In phase I we will determine the feasibility of this instrument, in both technical and practical terms. Our project team is uniquely qualified; since it has strong capability in both electro-optical instrumentation development in the commercialization of NDT instrumentation for the aerospace industry.",

(PRi) proposes to develop an automated inspection system based upon proven and emerging technologies developed by PRi that have provided excellent alternatives to present inspection needs. The candidate technologies for the new inspection system are Mangeto-Optic/Eddy Current Imaging and Optical methods, chiefly,laser holography and phase stepping fringe projection. We will establish the theoretical and practical performance boundaries for each of the candidate technologies through a serious of laboratory and field tests to demontrate the feasibility of developing an instrument that satisfied ENSIP requirements. We will combine these existing technologies with our Phase I results to build an innovative automated inspection system that will be usable in depot-level ENSIP inspecitons and that can replace many of the present EC and FPI inspections and signficantly reduce reliance on the use of hazardous chemicals.",

The noise canceling detector permits near shot-noise limited absorption measurements without frequency modulation techniques, resulting in a simpler, less expensive, lighter weight, and easier to use instrument compared to frequency modulation (FM) techniques. Signal dynamic range in excess of 10 will be achieved using selected pairs of absorption transitions.

The measurements will be based on room temperature, tunable diode laser absorption measurements using recently available InGaAsP lasers. Aunique, low-cost, and simple noise canceling detector (NCD) will be used to provide near shot-noise-limited performance for highly accurate measurements without the complexity and cost associated with frequency modulation (FM) absorption techniques. The NCD also permits use of low-cost, commercially available InGaAsP lasers rather than custom-fabricated, long-wavelength devices. The resulting system is pressure-independent, simpler to use, and lower cost than comparable FM-based systems. The Phase I portion of the program will demonstrate quantitative, simultaneous H20 density and temperature measurements over the range of temperatures expected in a combined-cycle Mach 6 exhaust nozzle. In Phase II, a prototype instrument for simultaneous H20 density, temperature, and velocity will be delivered and integrated with the Air Force High Mach Advanced Research Test Facility.",

We plan to investigate two versions of this maser, both to be built in the Phase II: the first is a full size version, and the second will be a compact version. The full size version will be comparable in size and power requirements to a common rubidium standard, but the stability will exceed that of a full size hydrogen maser. A compact version of this maser would be significantly smaller than any atomic standard currently available. The innovations that enable the development of these compact standards are: first, a gas cell design where a optical pumping and microwave interrogation occur in separate bulb volumes; and second, a rubidium gas cell that operates without a buffer gas and has been shown to produce a 10 Hz linewidth of the rubidium hyperfine transition. In the proposed Phase I program, we will investigate several technical issues to be addressed prior to the construction of the rubidium maser. After the comletion of the Phase I program, we will propose a Phase II program that will include the construction of the maser with both a full size and a compact cavity. Such a maser could have wide scale application in navigation systems, EW, bi-static and multi-static radar, as well as commercial areas.",

This Phase I program will evaluate the current technology in use, analyze the light transmission characteristics and emission spectra of the detonation products and shocked air for various explosive events using non-equilibrium chemistry codes, and determine parametric system requirements. In addition the materials needed for a low risk, highly robust prototype system will be identified.

The objective is to examine alternative tail rotor concepts for the AH-IW that could result in a more agile and maneuverable, quieter helicopter that is more survivable and less susceptable to battle damage. Additional speed capability and other improvements will be assessed. Specifically, the following alternative design concepts will be explored: a. No Tail Rotor (NOTAR) b. Vectored Thrust Ducted Propeller (VTDP) c. Fan-in-Fin 2. In assessing the relative merits of each of the concepts, the study will include, as a minimum, estimates of the effect on aircraft weight, performance and flying qualities, systems integration requirements, operational limitations, optimized configuration for high speed forward flight, R&M; comparisons to the current configuration, agility/ maneuverability considerations and the impact on survivability (e.g. noise, speed). The application of composite materials technology will also be addressed. 3. The product of this study will be a written report incorporating the comparative analysis at the 3 selected design concepts in each of the areas examined and a recommendation for the design concept to be explored in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The application of electromotive propulsion to rotorcraft provides several opportunities for the improvement of the helicopter's operational efficiency. The propulsion of rotors via tip thrusters has long been envisioned, since they provide the opportunity for higher G.W. helicopters, higher payload/G.W. ratios, and reduction in power and fuel requirements. Utilizing the electromotive drive to provide rotor blade propulsive thrust, as well as chordwise and blade coning balance, allows an overall reduction in weight empty, thus increasing the payload/lift capacity. This technology can be applied to rotorcraft gross weights from 10,000 to 350,000 lbs. The weight and complication of a mechanical drive are reduced with tip propulsion. Tip propulsion also eliminates the anti-torque side force required in a shaft-driven helicopter. Another advantage is the saving of the rotor blade balance weight (required for chordwise balance) by using the weight of the blade thruster and the drive system weight as the balance weight. This is particularly valuable in large diameter slow-turning rotors that require additional balance weight to keep the rotor coning angle within a practical angular limit. Improved lift performance, reduced maintenance, increased safety and reduced operational cost are potential attributes of the electromotive rotor tip propulsion system.",

This detector will have a response time of 5 ps, making it the fastest near-IR photodetector available. It will have a responsivity of 0.2 A/W and dark current < 50 nA, with an active area of 50x50 square micrometers. It will also be capable of generating signals with amplitudes exceeding 1 volt into 50 ohms. This detector will function like a photoconductor instead of a photodiode. Its speed will be derived from deep-level traps that form in InGaAs when grown under non-stoichiometric molecular-beam-epitaxy conditions. This technique has been applied by us to non-stoichiometric growth of GaAs to yield a 400-900 nm, metal-semiconductor-metal detector with 0.1 A/W sensitivity and 1 ps response time. This is the fastest visible photodetector in the world. During this Phase I we will develop the non-stoichiometric growth conditions for InGaAs. We will also use a newly developed 2-picosecond-resolution electrical probe to help design the ideal electrode geometries for both the detector and microwave launcher.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Recent advances in sealed bipolar lead/acid battery (SBLA) development by JPL have proved that it can be a viable candidate for Electric Vehicle (EV) propulsion and other power source applicaiton. However, the use of electrically resistive polymer composite materials as (quasi-) bipolar electrode substrates has suppressed the optimalhigh power possibility of the lead/acid system and presented difficulty for bipolar sealing and packaging. Pinnacle Research Institute, Inc. (PRI) proposes to remedy these problems by substituting the polymer composite with a ceramic oxide coated metal substrate. This ceramic oxide/metal substrate, which has been developed by PRI, is electrically conductive, mechanically sturdy and thin. Moreover, it is chemically and electro-chemically compatible with H2SO4 and thus the conventional requirement for SnO2 plating of the anode can be avoided. Utilizing the ceramic oxide/metal substrate will enble PRI to incorporate its in-house developed bipolar sealing technique developed for Ultracapacitor technology. PRI will demonstrate unit cells and the feasibility of a multiple cell SBLA which is predicted to have an energy density exceeding 50 WH/kg and power density greater than l kW/kg without degradation to cycle life. The proposed advanced SBLA will be extremely rugged, maintenance-free, long cycle and shelf lives and be well-suited to a low temperature operation (-55 degrees c) for weapons application.",

Critical to monitoring and maintaining the quality of recycled waters and assessing the effectiveness of new methods is the development of sensor instrumentation suitable for in situ detection of microbial species. Such sensors, integrated with a control and feedback loop, will allow appropriate action to be taken before crew health, plant, or food quality can be compromised. Polestar Technologies, and its subcontractor GEO- CENTERS, INC., proposes a Phase I program to demonstrate the feasibility of using proprietary sensing material, and fiber optic sensor technology, for the early detection of biofilm formation. This approach should provide not only the great sensitivity associated with optical transduction, but also the capability to monitor in situ, and in real time. This innovation, once developed, should also be readily extended to identification of specific microbial populations, biocompatibility studies of new materials, and monitoring of air filtration systems as may be required throughout NASA. In a subsequent Phase II program a prototype Fiber Optic Biofilm Monitor will be fabricated, tested, and delivered to Johnson Space Center for evaluation in a water reclamation test bed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Most modern military casualties entail shock, including hemorrhage, burns, heat stroke, and sepsis. Identifying shock accurately and promptly, after injury and during resuscitation efforts, will sharply reduce morbidity and mortality. The body's principal homeostatic response to shock is the diversion of blood flow away from the splanchnic viscera towards critical organs, such as the brain. The resultant mesenteric hypoperfusion produces intestinal mucosal ischemia, reflected by a decrease in mucosal and intraluminal p02 and a reciprocal increase in pC02. In this proposal, we offer to design (and in Phase II, implement) a sensor to measure the intraluminal gas tension of C02 and 02: a quantitative and direct early warning system for shock states. ANTICIAPTED BENEFITS: The technique is markedly superior to current modes of shock monitoring and has obvious dual-use potential for saving lives in both military & civilian surgical, emergency and intensive care settings. The nearly 20 million civilian cases require monitoring for shock in the U.S. annually would benefit from using our porposed sensor in hospitals or first aid situations.",

This proposal presents methods for the synthesis, characterization, and fabrication of polyurethaneurea (PUU) Primary Reference Materials (PRM). The proposed program involves the synthesis of a batch of additive-free PTMO based polyurethaneurea and a batch of additive-free PEO based polyurethaneurea followed by thorough characterization of the bulk and surface properties of cast films. Polymers that are free of unwanted surface active contaminants, as determined by ESCA and static SIMS, will be fabricated into film samples, 1 x 3 x 0.005 inches, and will be packaged, sterilized and characterized. Tubing extrusion methods will be evaluated for producing small diameter tubing samples with a 4 mm ID and 10 cm long. A feasibility study will be performed to determine if it is possible to fabricate implantable quality small diameter tubing 0.5 meter long. The effect of gamma radiation on physicochemical properties of polyurethaneureas will be determined. Changes in the surface properties of the PRM as a function of time/annealing will be assessed.",

Waveguide excimer laser technology will be used to directly etch diffractive phase gratings onto the substrate surface without intervening masks or complex chemical processing. This tool will be a completely integrated computer-aided design and computer-aided micro-machining workstation that will extend the benefits of diffractive optics technology to optical designers on a scale never before possible. With a single computer-based system, the engineer will be able to design, optimize, manufacture, measure, and refine diffractive optical elements of arbitrary structure on virtually any 2-D or 3-D surface. At the same time, the projected affordability and simplicity will put this tool within the reach of many designers and fabricators of optical components who are now forced to forego the advantages of diffractive elements in their optical designs due to the staggering development costs associated with conventional microlithographic methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The proposed Pulse Power Thyristor (PPT) could replace spark gaps, vacuum switches, thyratrons and ignitrons at operating temperatures over 200 C. The Pulse Power Opening Switch Thyristor (the PPOST), a variation of the PPT, could also exceed the performance of MCT's, IGBT's and GTO's with improved Safe Operating Area (SOA) and off-state performance, approaching that of a recovering diode. Both the PPT and PPOST have lower on-state voltage and a lower chip size for lower cost. Champion Aviation Products has agreed to fund necessary post SBIR work to enable manufacture of the proposed switches for use in high ambiant temperature exciter/igniter applications for jet/turbine starting applications. This proposal is based on the P.I.'s recent experience of applying fine integrated circuit geometries and bonded lead frames to both cathode and anode regions of positive beveled asymmetric thyristors. The 10.07 subtopics specifically addressed are high temperature Electronic devices for PMAD systems i.e. npn/pnp transistors arranged as regenerative pairs as in thyristor technology for high temperature aerospace exciter/igniter and electrical actuation applications.",

IN THIS METHOD, EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF CALCIUM HYDROXIDE ARE USED TO CAPTURE THE SO2 IN THE FLUE GAS.  THE FLY ASH FROM THESE FACILITIES DIFFERS FROM CONVENTIONAL PULVERIZED COAL FLY ASH IN THAT IT CONTAINS SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF SULFUR COMPOUNDS AND UNREACTED CALCIUM HYDROXIDE IN ADDITION TO THE COAL ASH-DERIVED FLY ASH.  THE RELATIVELY HIGH RATIO OF CALCIUM HYDROXIDE TO FLY ASH IS THEORETICALLY VERY PROMISING SINCE BOTH ARE KNOWN TO FORM POZZOLANIC REACTION PRODUCTS SIMILAR TO CEMENT HYDRATION, SUGGESTING THAT THE ECONOMICS OF USING THESE FLY ASHES IN BLENDED CEMENT WOULD BE MORE FAVORABLE THAN THOSE FOR CONVENTIONAL FLY ASHES.  HOWEVER, THIS POTENTIAL HAS NOT BEEN REALIZED TO DATE BECAUSE THE PROPORTION OF SULFUR COMPOUNDS IN THE DFGD WASTES IS TOO HIGH.  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL FOR PRODUCING A SPECIAL CLASS OF CEMENTS, TERMED EXPANSIVE CEMENTS, USING A HIGH PROPORTION OF DFGD WASTES BLENDED WITH PORTLAND CEMENT AND ANOTHER SPECIFIC ADDITIVE.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Development of high temperature materials (which can withstand temperatures of 2500 to 4000 Degrees F) will require new test techniques and new test machines which can measure their mechanical behavior under extreme environments. The new test machines should be capable of measuring mechanical and physical behavior under cyclic stresses at high frequencies of up to several kilohertz (2,000-5,000 Hz) at high temperatures. The damage tolerance factors to be tested include failure modes, crack and void growth, oxidation, etc. Existing materials test machines cannot test beyond 1,000 Hz; hence we propose to develop a new test machine with 5,000 Hz capability. Its central feature is examining the feasibility of the resonance principle to amplify the cyclic stress applied to the specimen. Another key feature is the use of a two-level vibration isolation system that permits the specimen to resonate, but prevents resonances in the machine frame. A third key feature is the employment of a closed-loop controller which will maintain constant cyclic stresses throughout the tests. In the Phase I, we proposed to address critical issues relating to incorporation of these key features and develop a layout of a conceptual configuration of the test machine.

Pattern selective approach is different from pixel averaging approach in its ability to retain the contrast of the important elements in the scene as obtained by the imaging systems. The sytem will be able to look into the shadows, and see subtle thermal variations in the scene, see low light emissions and reflections, while retaining individual detail from each sensor. The system will be built and delivered during Phase II of the program. During the Phase I of the program, the recording of scenes from the cameras will be obtained from the customer after which they will be digitized and aligned to each other. Differernt fusion algorithms will be tried to find the best algorithm for the image combination. Based on the results, a high level design will be done for the system.

Standard compression may introduce degradations which significantly reduce the usefulness of imagery and communications errors may further degrade utility. Innovative methods for representing and processing imagery prior to transmission via satellite and for reconstructing the imagery at the receiving site are needed to satisfy user requirements. Princeton Electronic Systems (PES) with support from the David Sarnoff Research Center, will investigate advanced technologies for Navy satellite applications. System performance studies, supported by image quality simulations utilizing existing software models, will be performed. High level requirements, comparison of performance, and recommendations for further research and development (Phase II) will be produced. The Sarnoff-developed wavelet compression will be the foundation for the study. Companion technologies, e.g., reliable imagery transport protocols, progressive transimission, and variable rate compression will also be evaluated. The team of PES and Sarnoff have outstanding capabilities to address this problem. Both Sarnoff and PES have experience in military systems. Sarnoff has been extremely successful in developing compression technologies for commerical application. This team will leverage prior experience and complementary expertises to provide high performance, cost effective solutions.",

It will be desirable to develop a single detection system for monitoring proliferation of WMD based on monitoring of the particulates and trace chemicals in the air by air sampling. All the WMD and their production facilities give out particulates or chemicals in the air which can be monitored by a air sampler and detection systems. The proposed detection systems are spectroscopic innature and have a number of common elements which can be used to design a compact monitoring system for nuclear, chemical and biological WMD. For nuclear detection, we will use a sensitive gamma detection system based on CdZnTe crystal detectors and MCA. For chemical detection we will use a diode laser based spectroscopic technique and for biological warfare agent detection we will use UV flourescence technique. In Phase I a review of all the existing detection technologies will be made and design of a compact system for monitoring of the WMD based on air sampling technique will be completed. The system will be built in Phase II. In addition, we will design and build a chemical detection system in Phase I which can be used for detection of chemical weapons as well as environmental pollution. The system for monitoring of the WMD can be used for environmental pollution measurement. Anticipated Benefits: The system, once developed, can be used to monitor the proliferation of WMD in certain countries in different parts of the world who have active programs in such weapons. The system can be used for air pollution and environmental monitoring and monitoring of chemical processes. There would be a large commercial market for such a system.",

PES proposes a 3-phase program. Phase 1, a 6-month effort, will demonstrate the capability of the software for mass spectrometric applications. The software was developed over 30 years and with an investment of 50 million dollars, to provide highly accurate and comprehensive analyses of performance of electron and ion lenses. Phase 2 effort will validate the accuracy of the proprietary software by modeling the detailed geometry and performance of a particular spectrometer lens design and experimentally measuring the performance. Phase 2 will also lay the groundwork enabling NASA and its contractors to submit requests for simulations and designs to be performed in the future. In Phase 3, the software will be used in the design, prototype fabrication, and manufacture of highly-portable and compact, i.e. hand held mass spectrometers, which as commercial- off-the-shelf products would be capable of revolutionizing and expanding the current $500 million dollar commercial marketplace and application areas for mass spectrometers. Benefits that NASA will achieve include: improved sensitivity, light-weight spectrometers for space payloads, enhanced recognition for efforts with industry to develop and commercialize new products.",

Detection sensitivity in the parts-per-billion level can be achieved. The technique offers 5 decades of linear dynamic range with a response time less than 1 second. Continuous time weight average monitoring is also possible. This technique has the advantage of high chemical selectivity, high sensitivity and non-intrusive nature of detection. Absorbance as low as a few parts in 10-8 can be detected. The use of diode laser and its pure electronic modulation-demodulation scheme permits a compact and portable instrument design. Hence, make possible the lightweight nitrogen dioxide detector. It also excludes some problems of existing detection technology which include: chemical reaction interferences, poor chemical selectivity, slow response, low sensitivity, bulky instrumentation, over concentration sample cell poisoning and optical window contamination induced problems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In this progam, Princeton Electronic Systems, Inc will develop a small, lightweight hand held gamma radiation detection and isotope identification system. The system will be intended for detection of clandestine movement of nuclear materials from nuclear facilities or storage areas and other places. The system will be easy to use and will display the radio nuclides whose radiation is detected by the system. To build such a system we will use semiconductor detectors like H912 or CdTe with the associated electronics for multi channel analysis. The electronics will be reduced in size by use of Multi Chip Module(MCM) or flex circuits and by using application specific ICs wherever suitable. A software will be developed to automatically identify the nuclides and display them on a small display. In the first phase of the program, the evaluafion of the detectors and the means for size reduction of the electronics will be done. After that the software requirement will be defined in detail and the design of the full system will be made during phase 1. Such a system will be used in many DOD programs as well by IAEA inspectors monitoring safeguards and for environmental applicafions. The prototype system will be built in phase H which will be tumed into a commercially available product and produced during Phase III. Anticipated Benefits: The prototype developed during Phase II of the program will be a product which will find many different applications. The most important high volume application will be for environmental applications, for monitoring radioactive contamination. The other applications will be for DOD, DOE and IAEA monitoring of nuclear safeguards. The product will have a high volume commerical market. A multi million dollars sales for this product is expected in near future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Today\\'s submarine towed array handling system operating parameters an methods are equivalent to those used in the late sixties. Attempts to utilize conventional cable handling methods are not suitable for array handling, and appropriate methods have not yet been defined. Outboard system volume, weight, system complexity, installation complexity, and cost far exceed acceptable standards for a handling system. Today\\'s systems should be operating at double their present retrieval speed while at double ship\\'s present deployment speed. To achieve both functional and operational advantage will require a new handling system concept rather than a larger machine. The proposed X-DRUM(TM) Capstan has the advantage of potentially meeting existing and next generation needs. Because of its bi-helical camming principle, bend radius is elliptically multiplied and size reduced proportionally as the square. It could provide an S-bend offset without guide tubes, which is a useful feature for submarine system installations. Its fixed drum simplicity and length to diameter aspect ratio also make this design best suited for outboard submarine installations. The intent of this feasibility study is to investigate high strength array messenger design and the possibility of dual stacked messenger operation. The advantage of dual messengers would be total encapsulation of the array, initial self threading of an array, and the capability to push the array for deployment. Our Phase I concept study will determine the probability of multiple stacked messengers and their maximum configural strength. These exploratory development concerns are primary because of submarine equipment location and reliability.",

We will use advanced composite structure, joining and sensor technology from our mentor/protege partner on this program, McDonnell Douglas Corp. (MDC). We will focus on cylindrical members which form the basic building block elements for many composite structures. We will focus on our low cost fillament winding technology and develop a hybrid composite fabrication and sensor embedment system for small diameter tubes. We will explore the use of micro electronic mechanical systems, laser holographic techniques, fiber optics and other sensors which would permit non-invasive communication. We will develop optimum methods of sensor embedment and communication including strain/vibration/shock/load measurement and flaw growth. In Phase I we will perform a feability analysis; explore alternate sensors, composite tubular structural concepts/manufacturing processes and sensor communication scenarios; develop non-invasive communication methodology; fabricate a demonstration componnet; provide cost and performance projections; and document all Phase I activities in a final report. In Phase II we will fianlize the detail embedded sensor and composite structure final design, fabricate samll diameter composite tubes with bendded sensors, evaluate the sensors to perform their desired function and prepare a Phase II final report. The use of ARPA Technology from the MDC/ARPA Embedded Sensors in Submarine Structures progra will significantly reduce the risk and cost of this program. Anticipated Benefits: Production Products will develop a non-invasive communications/sensor system for monitoring structural health real time using embedded sensors in polymer matrix composite structures.

Recent procedures using luminescence have often surpassed conventional isotopic methods; among these the luminescence of firefly luciferase is the most efficient. Relevant biomedical applications include reporter gene technology, viral and cell tracer methods, non-isotopic immunoassays and other probe technologies, and clinical biomass/viability assays. Through fundamental research on the enzymatic mechanism of beetle luciferases, we have developed new chemistry which provides greater luminescence intensity with simpler reaction kinetics. To better understand the commercial potential of beetle luciferases and to develop specific enzymes suited for applications, we are currently examining the structure and function of several adult-form isozymes. This project is for extending our investigations to include a new class of isozymes derived from embryonic and juvenile developmental forms of elaterid beetles. These isozymes are spectrally unique, and taxonomic data reveals that they are evolutionarily divergent. Yet, due to inaccessibility, these enzymes have never been investigated biochemically. In Phase l, genes encoding these novel isozymes will be isolated to allow for enzymological and physical studies of the recombinant enzymes planned for Phase II.",

The camera will incorporate a powerful removable computerwith color graphic display and a high speed multiwire sensor. Bedside production of radiopharmaceuticalwill be provided by an onboard 178W/178Ta computer controlled generator equipped with integral dosecalibration. Such technology will provide superior ventricular function assessment on a cost competitivebasis as well as a substantial advance in portability relative to any current nuclear camera.

A wingless missile has the lowest possible aerodynamic drag and is aerodynamically unstable which is desirable from a flight performance and maneuverability standpoint. However, to achieve its ultimate performance potential, the missile will reuire inflight stabilization. This capability is provided by the high speed MCB propulsive thrust control system which is capable of multiple (8-12) thruster output simultaneously. This enables a complement of thrusters to maintain the Wingless missile on its desired flight path while enabling other thrusters to maintain positive missile aerodynamic flight stability. This combined control capability cannot be provided by any current technology aero/TVC system. The major objective of this program is to achieve an expansive overall system performance improvement (e.g. 30%) in Tactical missile systems using Wingless missile technology.

HETEROJUNCTION DEVICES PROMISE TEN-FOLD PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS BUT LARGE-SCALE IC'S ARE REQUIRED TO ASSESS THESE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. SIGE HETEROSTRUCTURES OFFER SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE INCREASES WHILE COEXISTING WITH CURRENT PROCESSING AND PACKAGING TECHNOLOGY. SILICON SUBSTRATES ARE EASIER TO MANUFACTURE THAN GAAS OR INP SUBSTRATES. GE DOPING PROVIDES TEN TIMES THE PERFORMANCE OF SILICON HOMOJUNCTIONS. THUS, SIGE IC'S CAN BE MANUFACTURED RAPIDLY WITH RELATIVELY LOW COST. LARGE-SCALE IC'S WILL ASSESS SIGE'S PERFORMANCE, YIELD, AND POTENTIAL AS DROP-IN UPGRADES TO SILICON-ONLY SYSTEMS. Q-DOT PROPOSES A DELTA-SIGMA DECIMATION FILTER IC AS A PROCESS MONITOR. THE HIGH-SPEED FILTER CAN BE INITIALLY PARTITIONED INTO SMALLER, PIPELINED CHIPS BEFORE INTEGRATION INTO A SINGLE IC. THE PROCESS TECHNOLOGY AND CHIP DESIGN CAN EVOLVE TOGETHER, MINIMIZING THE OVERALL PROGRAM RISK WHILE PROVIDING USEFUL INTERMEDIATE IC'S FOR DETERMINIG LSI/VLSI YIELD AND RELIABILITY. SMALLER TEST CELLS UTILIZING HBT'S, FET'S, AND/OR RTD'S WILL PROVIDE HIGH-YIELDING PROCESS CHARACTERIZATION CELLS. Q-DOT CURRENTLY HAS A DELTA-SIGMA AND PROGRAM, PROVIDING IMMEDIATE SIGE TECHNOLOGY INSERTION. INITIAL FILTER AND CELL DESIGNS WILL BE PERFORMED DURING PHASE I.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Q-Dot, Inc. proposes an innovative \"no-drop\" regulator (NDR) for low-voltage micro-power sensor systems. Based upon charge-coupled devices (CCD's), it provides high efficiency with less noise and at a low cost. Designed for battery or solar-cell systems, it has zero-volt input-to-output differential for highly efficient \"no-drop\" regulation. A 3 V NDR requires only two 1.5 V batteries, decreasing its size and weight. A linear regulator's inherent diode drop requires three batteries. A switch-mode regulator includes an isolation diode, reducing its efficiency and limiting the maximum input voltage to a diode drop above the desired output voltage. The NDR provides isolation without a diode, allowing operation with higher voltages. CCD's also produce lower noise and ripple than conventional switch-mode regulators. Voltage multiplication is possible with the NDR if desired. Thus, more efficient, lower-noise operation over a wider voltage range than competing regulators is possible. The NDR feasibility will be assessed during Phase I. Prototypes will be fabricated and tested during Phase II. Broad DARPA and commercial applications will drive Phase III production of this innovative regulator concept. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: High-efficiency regulation will extend the life of any battery-operated system. Examples include hand-held telecommunication, GPS, and imaging systems; notebook and laptop computers; cellular phones and mobile radios; remote sensors and data collection systems; pagers, beepers, and other remote signalling devices.",

The pathophysiological significance of oxygen free radicals and transition metal catalysis extends to any organ system and includes carcinogenesis including leukemia, coronary artery disease, inflammation, ageing, and neurodegenerative disease and stroke. An important aspect to these studies is the development of iron defined serum-free medium for in vitro iron metabolism studies. The goal of Phase I is to develop such serum-free medium free of iron contaminated components such as albumin or transferrin. The substitution of albumin with lipid microemulsions or lipid bound cyclodextrins will be evaluated. Substitutions of transferring with iron molecules as iron citrate will be explored. These studies will focus on two cell lines, Raji and IEC-6 cells, used in such iron studies and later as time permits primary rat duodenal cells.",

These mutations will be based upon sequence alterations that have previously been identified by Naval medical researachers in non-virulent or attenuated dengue 1 strains as potentially useful for development of an attenuated dengue 1 vaccine. In Phase II, mutagenized cDNA clones will be combined with appropriate cloned parental wt dengue 1 sequences to produce full-length chimeric dengue 1 cDNAs. These full-length viral cDNAs will subsequently be transcribed into infectious dengue 1 viral RNAs containing mutations of interest for development of a live attenuated dengue 1 viral vaccine and for analysis of dengue 1 pathogenicity and immunogenicity.",

The development of chemically defined osteoclast hematopoietic reagents would be ofinestimable importance for gaining specific information concerning phenomena such as the proliferationof osteoclasts and the role which these cells play in the process of hematopoiesis, bone formation, andbone resorption. We will develop an osteoclast/hematopoieticre agents that will support in vitroosteoclasts colony formation. Culture of osteoclast requires the presence of ill-defined components.The research herein will be to develop osteoclast/hematopoietic reagents and the technology to avoidthe use of serum or any other ill-defined component. This reagent will fill the critical void to provideinvestigators who are working in this exciting area. They have preliminary data indicating thatosteoclast/hematopoietic reagents in combination with purified osteoclast colony stimulating factorssupported osteoclast colony formation. However, the reagent formulation needs to be further developedsince it did not support colony formation equivalent to serum containing reagents. This proposal willdevelop osteoclasts/hematopoietic kits and reagent medium for osteoclast proliferation that does notrequire the presence of serum. These reagents will be valuable in assessing the growth parameters ofosteoclast in both normal and diseased states. It also will be of value in assessing the cytokinesinvolved in these processes.",

To do this, SWFTDA uses the software developers expertise about the application system, combined with SWFTDAs built-in expertise about software fault tolerance.  SWFTDA also provides the building blocks for modeling and implementing software fault tolerance.  The purpose of the SWFTDA is to help users - determine whether to apply SWFT techniques in a particular application, - select candidate data diverse SWFT techniques for their applications,- evaluate those techniques using a modeling tool,- choose the recommended technique based on candidate selection criteria and simulation results, and - implement the recommended technique using reusable code.SWFTDA was qualification tested by examining a database controller for a commercial order processing and workflow system.  The most appropriate software fault tolerance techniques for the application were determined by SWFTDA.  The system was modeled using modeling templates of the candidate techniques.  Based on the simulation results and trade-off analysis, a final technique was selected for implementation.

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose to develop novel techniques that enhance the detection and indentification of cluttered targets using wavelet transform (WT) techniques. Two approaches will be explored. The first approach characterizes various clutters by suitably selected wavelet packets such that the WT coefficients are contributed mostly by clutter information but almost not affected by the targets. Bu subtracting these WT coefficients from the original signal, the clutters are effectively suppressed and thus the target detection can be greatly enhanced. The second approach is the wavelet matched filter which is synthesized wth reference data and wavelet packets that represent the features of the target. The wavelet matched filter incorporates the efficient feature detection and noise suppression capability of the WT and high discrimination ability of the matched filter. The clutter reduction and target identification operations are performed in a single step. The performance of the developed alforithms and the hardware implementations will also be investigated.",

Recent advances in semiconductor technology led to development of light emitting diodes (LEDs) capable of high irradiance with electrical efficiencies at least equivalent to other lamps currently used as plant light sources. The LED has other characteristics, such as safety, reliability, long life, and low mass and volume, making it a very desirable irradiance source for space applications. Commercially available LEDs designed as indicator lamps are not entirely satisfactory for plant lighting. Proposed research would fabricate and evaluate alternate methods of mounting semiconductor chips to provide significant electrical efficiencies when operated at high current inputs with conventional discrete LEDs. Increased electrical efficiency would relate to improved heat dissipation from the chips and the geometric dispersion of photons emitted from semiconductor chips. In addition to space applications, highly efficient LED lighting units would find extensive terrestrial commercial applications for hydroponic plant growing operations, household ornamental plant growing, and plant photobiological research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Heterojunction bipolar transistor, HBT, technology offers an extremely attractive alternative to field effect transistors, FETs, for a variety of high speed applications. High p-type base doping levels (on the order of 1O 20 power cm-3) have allowed for the improvement of the maximum oscillation frequency, f max, as well as current gain cutoff frequency. Commonly used p-type dopants, Be and Zn, suffer from diffusion during the epitaxial growth process as well as during high current level operation resulting in decreased emitter injection efficiency. Carbon as a p-type dopant is attractive because of its low diffusion coefficient. The use of carbon in the base of an npn HBT increases the wafer yield and device reliably by eliminating dopant diffusion into the emitter during epitaxial growth and reducing the current induced degradation of the dc gain observed during operation. Pennsylvania State University has installed a gas source carbon cell on their existing Varian Gen II MBE and is currently using CBr4 as their source for carbon, while QED has installed an electron beam evaporation solid source carbon cell to one of their existing Varian Gen II MBEs. Phase I of this program will investigate the two most promising carbon doping techniques in order to establish the most viable.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors (QWIPs) based on the III-V material system make an excellent detector choice for certain infrared applications. Although the QWIP does not compare favorably with the ideal HgCdTe detector due to its intrinsically shorter carrier lifetimes (about 1-10 ps) leading to large thermal generation rates, it does benefit from the more mature III-V epitaxial growth technology which allows better control and uniformity. In particular, for applications such as NASA's Earth Observation Satellite (EOS), which contains the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), the QWIP provides an ideal choice for the 12-16 micron region. The high Hg content required for operation in this region results in reproducibility difficulties as well as excessive dark currents. The high noise requires the additional expense of a space qualified chopper and associated differential amplifiers for each of the array elements. Although much work has been reported on the GaAs/AlGaAs based QWIP, the InGaAs/GaAs version will yield improved performance. The higher carrier mobility and lower effective mass associated with the InGaAs well and GaAs barriers will yield significantly enhanced response.",

The purpose is to develop, implement, test, and document a Telephone Interviewer Monitoring and Evaluation System (TIMES) that will measure, analyze, and report the interviewer error. TIMES will assist in significantly reducing the interviewer error and increasing the quality of survey data. TIMES will be particularly useful in reducing the interviewer response effects that occur in sensitive questions concerning sexual practices, drug and alcohol use, and the incidence of disease. TIMES will provide a split-screen option so that the supervisor simultaneously can observe the actual administration of the questionnaire item and enter question-specific evaluation regarding the interviewer's behaviors. Mr. Trumble, MA, Principal Investigator, has eighteen years of experience in managing survey research projects and successfully managed two previous CATI development projects. Merrill Shanks, PhD, is a consultant for the project. He is the Director of the Computer-assisted survey Methods Program at Berkeley, the program that developed CASES. Times is applicable to all 61 CASES users. It will be of interest to all organizations conducting research for which total survey error is an important consideration, e. g., epidemiology, economic indicators, and agricultural forecasts.",

We will address three primary areas of concern: element-to-element crosstalk, array manufacturability, and miniaturization of beam- forming circuit. The Phase I effort will include theoretical predictions of the HFTDA beam patterns based on small scale testing results, an analysis of the robustness of the beam pattern to the random phase and amplitude errors in the individual transducers, and an experimentally verified HFTDA manufacturing approach.",

The Radant Lens (TM) configuration - parallel conducting plates with PIN switching diode controlled phase shift circuits - interacts directly with a plane wave to produce beam scanning, thereby eleminating the discrete components and connectors that add to the high cost of conventional, discrete element phased arrays. Previous implementations of the Radant Lens (TM) utilized glass-packaged diodes that are easy to handle and are adequate for applications up to 10 or 12 GHz. Chip diodes cost less than glass-packaged diodes and also eliminate stray package capacitance that decreases the transmission and bandwidth and requires experimental characterization for each application. Use of chip diodes in the Radant Lens (TM) would decrease the cost and improve RF performance. Such improvements would increase the feasibility of commercial applications of the Radant Lens (TM) to Air Traffic Control radars, for example.",

The software willalso indicate possible drawbacks of each option. The programs will be simple enough that at least oneprofessional at each radiation oncology facility will be able to use them interactively, with a thoroughunderstanding of their implications.

The proposed method involves measuring the impedance associaated with driving different radius indentors into the material, as a function of frequency. With multiple data points for the impedance as a function of endentor radius (at a given frequency), nonlinear simulataneous equations are solved to obtain all four constants of interest directly from the complete impedance relation for a radiating sphere in a viscoelastic medium. This approach will be demonstrated in Phase I. In addition, data acquisition time gating will be examined as a means of overcoming finite sample thickness issues. This will be supported by analytical theory development for radiation impedance in finite thickness materials. Because the proposed multi-indentor polymer characterization scheme uses the complete sphere radiation theory, it not only provides all of the complex moduli data, byt should improve accuracy over the present approach which relies on modeling the system with a single spring rate. This method will also be valid for frequencies beyond 1000 Hz.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         RADSAR is an innovation which provides aperture synthesis radiometer technology with the performance potential to exceed existing needs for military and commerical/civilian high resolution electromagnetic mapping and sensing of meterological phenomena. Microwave electromagnetic radiometry has long been seen as the premier technology for meterological sensing by virture of its inherent performance characteristics. However, it has languished compared to elecro-optical techniques and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) because it has needed very large antennas for good performance. RADSAR overcomes this problem by synthesizing a large aperture like a SAR. In this option we will provide conceptual designs and performance evaluations for airborne and spaceborne meteorological and environmental sensor systems and we will analyze the potential for commerical development. Validation will be provided by computer modeling and design review. This new technology can benefit spaceborne and airborne meteorological, environmental and military intelligence systems. A major commercialization study effort has revealed a wide range of interested potential customers including agribussiness, banks, commodities brokers, and local government air quality management districts, in addition to NASA and the military.",

Aberrations are minimized using contoured fringes calculated to compensate for spherical aberrations and to reduce astigmatism and coma that results from operation off axis and at a wavelength different than the construction wavelength. Chromatic dispersion is not a problem for laser line reception and multiple line operation is possible by stacking the reflectors. A 16 inch mirror for operation at 532 has been made and delivered, methods of making the same at near IR wavelengths are discussed.",

The tissue's response is highly influenced by its optical properties as well as thegeometry of the incident beam. Sometimes modification of the profile of the beam to match the volumeof tissue involvement during procedure such as photodynamic and photothermal therapy is desired.Recently, interest has developed in fiberoptics for contact surgery and uniform irradiation of tissue duringphotodynamic therapy. More recently, side emitting tips have been developed for directional irradiationduring photothermal therapy. These tips are designed to reflect the laser beam at a 90 degree angle.If a large surface of tissue needs to be irradiated, one must position the tip with multiple laser exposure,aimed only at the untreated areas. Other diffusing tips have not been optimized for the delivery of tensof watts needed for coagulating large volumes. We seek to further develop a family of diffusing tips fordirectional and non-directional, isotropic distribution of laser light. We will optimize diffusing tips at 630nm for PDT therapy, 800 and 940 nm light from laser diodes, and l.06um for photocoagulation therapy.These tips will be characterized in air, phantom media, and tissue samples to evaluate and optimize theirperformance.",

Large migratory bird populations drawn to a nearby landfill have threatened JFK airport, where safety of flight considerations nearly caused shutdown of the airport. Aircraft operators, including USAF, are now liable for civil damages should an aircraft strike and kill and endangered species of bird. Relatively recent evidence indicates that \"infrasound\" (below 20Hz) is an important sensory input into bird behavior, providing cues for navigation, and it is theorized, \"warnings\" that elicit avoidance responseds. The proposed research develops a scientific baseline for gull, raptor, and waterfowl reaction to infrasound. Further, the research would define mechanically replicable infrasound parameters that provide avoidance stimuli to two of the three species. The goal of the research is to test the feasibility of developing an infrasonic device, or family of devices, that could be used around airfields to reduce the occurrence of aircraft/bird collisions by 50% or more. Though definition of conceptual designs, using data gathered from USAF, the contractor performs a Cost and Operational Efffectiveness Analysis to show potential benefits to be gained by Phase II research and/or prototype development.",

The carbon bed absorbs most hydrocarbons and CHCs, while the catalytic oxidizer removes the methane and CO which cannot be absorbed. Because carbon has little affinity for CHCs, and because no current catalysts oxidize CHCs at reasonable temperatures, the large carbon bed used to absorb the CHCs must be replaced every three months. Periodic replacement of the carbon bed is one of the top thirty maintenance items on Space Station Freedom. To reduce the frequency with which the bed must be replaced, TDA Research will develop and test novel metal oxide based catalysts to determine whether they can oxidize CHCs at reasonable temperatures, in the presence of water, and without the production of toxic by-products. These new catalysts can potentially operate at temperatures 200@C lower than current platinum catalysts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Aircraft designed for flight in the Mach 3-6 range must incorporate active cooling in the turbo-ramjet propulsion system. The required cooling can be provided by endothermic reactions of the fuel prior to its combustion. Most endothermic fuel reactions require a catalyst. Incorporation of a solid catalyst into a fuel heat exchanger suitable for aircraft use significantly complicates its design and increases its size and weight. In addition, catalyst lifetime, in many cases, is limited and the catalyst must be periodically replaced or regenerated. TDA Research (TDA) proposes to investigate compounds that, when added to hydrocarbon fuels, initiate endothermic fuel reactions. TDA will conduct tests with a variety of initiators and measure the reaction rate, product distribution, and the endotherm of the reaction. We will compare the results to both catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions.",

In the Phase I project, TDA Research, Inc. (TDA), demonstrated a new type of catalyst with high activity for hydrodechlorination of aliphatic and aromatic CHCs.  The catalysts are significantly lower in cost, more resistant to deactivation by the HC1 byproduct, and have rates similar to or higher than supported platinum group metal catalysts.  Furthermore, unlike the platinum group catalysts, their catalytic activity can be fully regenerated.",

Acute arsenic poisoning results from ingestion of only 100 mg of the element, while chronic poisoning occurs with the continued ingestion of smaller amounts.  Processes developed for arsenic removal from drinking water are appropriate for small volumes of water with low levers of dissolved and suspended solids, are only feasible when competing anions such as sulfates or chlorides are absent, and, therefore, are too expensive for the treatment of industrial wastewaters.",

THIS JEOPARDIZES OUR LONG TERM OUTLOOK FOR LEADERSHIP IN A HIGH TECH WORLD.  ONE EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGE TO REMEDY THIS IS TO TEACH SCIENCE MORE THE WAY SCIENTISTS VIEW IT, NAMELY AS AN EVOLVING PROCESS OF INQUIRY, RATHER THAN AS A BODY OF FACTS AND \"TRUTH\" AS MOST PEOPLE COMMONLY VIEW IT.  FURTHER, SCIENCE AND MATH SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN AN ENJOYABLE CONTEXT TO INCREASE INTEREST.  ONE SOLUTION TO MEET BOTH OF THESE CRITERIA LIES IN A MARRIAGE OF INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEM (ITS) AND ELECTRONIC GAME TECHNOLOGIES.  THIS PROJECT WOULD CREATE & INTELLIGENT TUTORING GAME (ITG) TO TEACH THE TECHNIQUES OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY THAT SCIENTISTS HAVE, WHILE DELIVERING AN INDIVIDUALIZED PROGRAM OF INSTRUCTION THAT IS BOTH ENJOYABLE AND TAILORED TO THE SPECIFIC LEARNING NEEDS OF EACH PLAYER.  PHASE I WILL BE DEVOTED TO TESTING THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH BY: (1) DEFINING THE TOPICS AND SKILLS TO BE TAUGHT, (2) DEVELOPING AN INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACH, (3) DEVELOPING AN ITG FRAMEWORK, (4) DEVELOPING A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT ITG, (5) EVALUATING THE ITG, AND (6) PREPARING AND DELIVERING THE FINAL REPORT.

Multiplexing the analysis is one wayto reduce the cost and improve the efficiency. We will develop, produce and distribute microsatellitemarkers suitable for multiplex analysis on automated hardware. We currently produce and distributeover 3,000 microsatellite markers to over 100 labs for the analysis of linkage in human, mouse and rat.These are typically analyzed using 32p, autoradiograms and manual scoring. Many of these markers rununder poorly defined PCR conditions further complicating the procedure. The markers would allownono-isotopic, automated detection, multiple marker per lane and would all run under validate PCRconditions. This would be achieved by the redesign of primer sequences where necessary, carefullyselecting well space markers with allele size ranges that would allow multiple markers per lane, andmulticolored fluorescent labeling which would further increase the number of markers per lane. Markerset with 10 cM resolution in human would be the objective of phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ResearchSouth, Inc. proposes to develop methodology and preliminary design computer software for the analysis of stiffened composite panels used in designing hot structures on hypersonic vehicles. Phase I of the development will investigate the following major areas of the preliminary design of panel structures which are subjected to severe thermomechanical loading during operation. We will develop algorithms and strategies for determining critical design condition loads from the output of finite element models of the structure. We will investigate at least three approaches: an automated search program which will evaluate output files from finite element models and define critical thermomechanical loading conditions and structural elements from time-consistent load histories: a statistical model which uses the finite element data from large samples and determines the most probable set of design conditions: and a deterministic mathematical model in which a functional is formed using the finite element data base with the design condition combinations being produced by a calculus of variations minimization solution. We will also develop a buckling analysis program which uses conventional analytical methods to define the buckling loads and margins of safety of critical equivalent stiffened panels. We will investigate, demonstrate and deliver adaptive meshing software to improve the resolution of internal loads and the capture of peak moments in stiffened panels and substructure for evaluation of local crippling of the hot structure. Prototype software will be available and delivered at the end of the Phase I effort. Phase II will extend the concepts and software to the operational mode, interfacing with most commercially-available finite element structural packages. Benefits to NASA will include more cost-effective preliminary design programs and more reliable designs.",

Radiographic means are perhaps the state-of-the-art today and, unfortunately, have been for the past several decades since their inception. Popular, \"high-tech\" means of noninvasive body imaging, such as magnetic resonance (MRI), ultrasound, or computed tomography (CT), all exhibit technical hurdles which have historically made it inconceivable to image the characteristic slow motions and small volumes of the microcirculation. Our recent innovation in medical ultrasound has made it possible to detect microcirculatory blood flow; the medical ultra sound injects a special contrast agent and analyzes a previously ignored component of the backscattered echo. In this project, it is intended to extend this Doppler and one-dimensional imaging technique to two-dimensional imaging. A short term feasibility study will modify and test a commercial duplex ultrasonic imaging system on in vivo animal model. The modifications will involve an external \"plug-in\" module to avoid damage to the imager and to expedite the animal experiments. This innovation will revolutionize many areas of medical diagnosis. These areas will range from retinal blood flow imaging to characterization of diabetic micropathy to tumor detection and assessment without the introduction of hazardous substances or radiations.",

Reception of very low and extra low frequency sferics from lightning by a network of wideband digital receivers will provide a more complete database for weather prediction. The receivers convert the received signals into digital format immediately after a front-end preamplifier, and use digital signal processing to execute identification algorithms on several bands simultaneously. The network will support atmospheric research with full-spectrum capture of sferics data and execution of experimental algorithms while maintaining its monitoring function.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The following proposal contains a design that significantly suppresses the vibration associated with space structures. Our intention is to develop a chaotically controlled suppression system utilizing electrorheological (ER) material based adaptive structures. ER material structures can suppress structural vibrations through three functional characteristics: variable structural damping, resonance circumvention, and modal shape control. Theological Systems will develop chaotic control methods to synergize the three functionalities into a single control system. Chaotic methods are chosen because of the inherent nonlinearities and complexities of controlling structural vibrations. The distinguishing features of chaos are unpredictable behavior where no relation between cause and effect seem to exist. Most structural vibration applications exhibit chaotic behavior. The concept of chaotic control is to bound a region embedded in the chaotic attractor through time dependent perturbations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Fungal pathogens are responsible for a variety of diseases ranging from innocuous dermalmycoses to life-threatening systemic infections. In recent years the number of serious fungal infectionshas increased markedly as a result of the growing number of immunosuppressed and immunocompromis-ed individuals, such as AIDS patients, transplant recipients, and chemotherapy or radiotherapy patients.Efficacious and non-toxic antifungal therapeutics are difficult to identify, in part due to the fact that bothhumans and fungi are eukaryotes and share many potential molecular targets in common. Mostantifungals currently used act against a limited number of targets found primarily on the fungal cellsurface. An urgent need exists for more antifungal agents, especially those acting against additionaltargets. Translation-targeted therapeutics are particularly desirable because of their proven value intreating bacterial infections. This proposal describes a novel high-throughput screen for identifying newantifungal agents specifically targeted against protein translation. The assay identifies translationalinhibitors by their ability to stimulate the growth of a specially-designed test fungus on an indicatormedium. Secondary assays are used to verify specificity for fungal translation and to determine toxicityto human cells. Preliminary results with purified compounds of known activity support the proposal.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The primary long term objective will be the large scale production of novel organometallic reagents prepared from highly reactive Rieke Metals. Primary metals to be examined include zinc, magnesium, copper, and calcium. The development of highly reactive Rieke Metals allows the direct oxidative addition of these metals to a variety of carbon-halogen bonds to yield many classes of organometallic reagents which previously could not be prepared. In particular, highly functionalized organozinc and organocopper reagents are now possible. Highly reactive magne- sium allows the preparation of difficult to prepare Grignards and a highly significant new organometallic class of reagents: (2-butene-1,4-diyl)magnesium reagents. Highly reactive calcium can be used for the generation of calcium derivatized polymers. These polymers can be functionalized with a wide variety of electrophiles, including chiral substrates, leading to novel chromatographic materials for the separation of enantiomers. The organozinc, organocopper, and 1,3-butadiene magnesium complexes have considerable potential in the synthesis of a wide range of drugs, drug delivery systems, agrochemicals, novel membranes, and polymers, including highly conducting polymers.",

At the end of this Phase I program we will demonstrate the feasibility of achieving: * High temperature alignment stability of the poled polymers 250'C stability for IC bonding IOO'C long term thermal stability *E/O coefficient > 20 pm/V for the material *Optical loss < 1.0 dB/cm for the material In addition we will prepare and present schemes to fabricate a multilayer HIOC using materials developed in this program and existing in house process and design technology. We have developed a new approach which simultaneously increases both the E/O coefficient and the thermal stability. The resultant material also possesses excellent processing characteristics and has been fabricated into test devices. For the past five years ROITech and Enichem America have been jointly developing materials and process technology for the development of HIOC devices. This materials technology is based on new chromophores containing heteroaromatic units and their combination with several high temperature polymer systems. this new proven technology forms the basis of this proposal and has the highest probability of achieving the program goals and of being carried into production of HIOC devices.",

The candidate engine model is small, lightweight and, depending on the model chosen, produces from one to two horsepower per cubic inch displacement and has the potential for even higher power density (the 70 series rotary demonstrated five horsepower per cubic inch displacement). The engine is a true multifuel engine with the capability of operating on heavy fuels and gasoline. The study will detemine the engine generator combination that provides the ac and dc power needs while optimizing other system requirements such as smoke emission, fuel economy, noise and infrared signature.

ROYAL HAWAIIAN SEA FARMS PROPOSES TO DEVELOP MASS SPAWNING AND SETTLING TECHNIQUES, THE FIRST STEPS NECESSARY TO REALIZE LARGE LAND BASED AQUACULTURE OF OPIHI. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL EVALUATE FOUR METHODS TO STIMULATE SPAWNING AND FOUR TECHNIQUES TO INDUCE SETTLING AND METAMORPHOSIS. BECAUSE THE REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF OPIHI IS VERY SIMILAR TO ABALONE, PROVEN COMMERCIAL ABALONE HATCHERY TECHNIQUES SHOULD BE APPLICABLE TO OPIHI. SIMULATION OF NATURAL LUNAR, TIDAL, AND SEASONAL REPRODUCTIVE CUES WILL MAKE CAPTIVE SPAWNING ON A LARGE SCALE POSSIBLE, AND THE ADDED EFFECT OF UV IRRADIATION AND SEROTONIN INJECTIONS, SO SUCCESSFUL WITH OTHER MOLLUSKS, WILL LIKELY RESULT IN INCREASED EFFICIENCY. OPIHI REQUIRE SUBSTRATES WITH BIOFILMS TO SETTLE. VARIOUS TYPES OF NATURAL BIOFILMS FROM DIFFERENT WATER SOURCES, AS WELL AS SOME PRODUCED FROM LABORATORY DIATOM MONOCULTURES WILL BE TESTED AS SETTLING INDUCERS ALONG WITH SOME PROMISING CHEMICAL INDUCERS, SUCH AS GABA AND ELEVATED POTASSIUM LEVELS.",

Detection of mycobacterial antigens in a liquid phase will allow thediagnosis of mycobacterial infection in biological fluids such as sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid,cerebral spinal fluid and synovial fluid. Ultimately, gas or vapor phase detection of mycobacterialantigens by a piezo-immunosensor would allow rapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis by detectionof mycobacterial antigens in expired human breath. The feasibility of this novel approach to thediagnosis of tuberculosis will be tested using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to specificmycobacterial antigens. The antibodies will be coupled to gold electrodes on AT-cut 9 MHz quartzcrystals. The resulting piezoelectric- immunosensor will be tested for its ability to detect mycobacterialantigens in culture supernatants and in solutions of antigen vaporized by a nebulizer.",

This method has been validate by comparison of the estimated results withdata recorded from subdural grids in neurosurgical patients, and further validation work is beingperformed in ongoing studies. During Phase I, we will determine the practical feasibility of the Deblurringmethod by examining how the accuracy of the method is affected by noise, sampling density at thescalp, and errors in modeling the electrical properties of the skull and scalp.

Unfortunately, it has not been possible to transition promising research findings into operational applications, because in-flight physiological recordings are contaminated by instrumental and physiological artifacts. Advances in cockpit recording technology have all but eliminated instrumental artifacts. Here we propose to tackle the remaining obstacle by developing an advanced signal processing system for Real-time physiological Artifact Detection And Reduction (RADAR). We will leverage our previous development of effective algorithms for detecting movement, eye, muscle, and other artifacts, and for efficiently reducing the effects of eye and muscle contaminants, in EEG data collected in the laboratory. During Phase I we will test the effectiveness of these algorithms on data recorded in flight to determine needed improvements and extensions, and then formulate a plan for the Phase II effort in which a complete solution to the problem of detecting and eliminating contaminants in in-flight physiological recordings will be implemented.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Design information for most of America's infrastructure is held as paper blueprints and paper specifications. It is estimated that 10 billion sheets of paper drawings exist for state and federal projects alone. Yet to perform necessary modern engineering analysis on these drawings, the blueprints must be in electronic form, not paper form. Present methods to convert these paper drawing to digital form are slow, expensive, and error prone. Making an electronic copy is 40 to 90 times more expensive than making a paper copy, a cost of $800 billion to $1.8 trillion dollars to convert all existing drawings to electronic formats. This research will develop new frameworks and algorithms to reduce the cost of converting a paper blueprint to electronic format. These new methods will reduce costs by a factor of ten and will improve the quality of the finished conversion. The research will combine recent advances in scanner technology, advances in algorithm technology, and government advances in modeling languages to make these improvements possible. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - This research will provide an inexpensive, accurate, and seamless method to capture the original semantic intent of the paper blueprints, and will be an enabling technology for improving existing products and structures.",

Phosphorylation of critical sites can influence binding of transcriptionfactors to specific regulatory elements, affect heterodimer formation between different members withinbroad families of transcription factors and influence the effect of transcription factor binding on geneexpression. As a prototype system for the generation of phosphorylation site specific anti-bodies to keyregulatory mammalian transcription factors we propose the development, in Phase I, of affinity-purifiedrabbit polyclonal antibodies to peptides encompassing phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated c-jun p39at serine residues 63,73 and 246. These will be assayed for ability to discriminate phosphorylated andnon-phosphorylated forms of purified c-jun p.39. In parallel, agarose conjugated antibodies andconsensus sequence oligonucleotides will be developed as solid phase reagents for enrichment of c-junp39 form nuclear extracts to enhance analysis of its extent of phosphorylation. In Phase II and III, thesestudies will be extended to the development of c-jun p39 phosphorylation site specific monoclonalantibodies, analysis of phosphorylation sites on transcription factors which form heterodimericcomplexes with jun, such as members of the CREB/AFT family, and the isolation of hybridoma clonesproducing monoclonal antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of the dipeptide Ser-Pro.",

Therefore the focus of this program is to identify and demonstrate solutions to the technical problems imposed by the strict specifications of the \"electronic grade\" sapphire demanded by SOS applications. The requirements for the sapphire substrate are well understood and many thousands of sapphire substates have been manufactured by various crystal growth techniques. It is the necessity of meeting these demanding specifications and keeping the cost low that is the problem. There is no doubt that EFG can produce low cost substrates if the yield is high. The presence of dislocations, lineage, polycrystallinity and inclusions have all served to keep this yield low. The identification of the technical solutions to these problems will serve to increase the quality of EFG sapphire to the point of producing truly cost effective 6 and 8 inch sapphire SOS substrates.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In military and commercial aircraft, airframe health is central to operating safety, maintenance costs, and aircraft availability. While thorough inspections provide the best means of assessing airframe health, they are expensive, time consuming, and can inflict new damage to the aircraft. Other methods of estimating airframe health, such as flight logs and service records, must be veryconservative to account for variations in operational loading and corrosion. Recently, researchers have been investigating embeddable sensors for real-time sensing of airframe strains, but their high cost and their requirement for composite structures render these systems impractical for near-term implementation. In this proposal, Sarcos Research Corporation (SRC) outlines a develoment effort for an airframe health monitoring system based on micro machined strain sensors. The system will monitor real-time fatigue and strain in both metallic and non-metallic structures. By using an innovative digital sensor developed by SRC previously, this system will measure the absolute strain at each sensing point, without the drift associated with conventional strain gages. Phase I will develop a system design that will include monolithic signal processing and mutliplexing to improve performance and greatly reduce wiring and weight requirements. Phase II will implement a prototype system of distributed strain sensors, and Phase III will focus on commercial development of the system. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The robust and versatile health monitoring system proposed will have immediate application in the military and commercial aircraft industry. Other areas where structural performance is critical, such as in naval vessels, space structures, bridges, and buildings, will also benefit from this development.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Progress in electric flight control has been hindered by the lack of a high bandwidth actuator. The challenge is to identify an efficient, responsive, and powerdense source of mechanical displacement. Actuators based on \"giant\" magnetostrictive materials, such as Terfenol, achieve very high magnetic strain (up to 2,000 ppm) and therefore provide power density unmatched in electromechanical systems. They outperform all known piezoelectric materials in terms of mechanical properties. SatCon has used Terfenol in several high performance actuators for space applications. In a large-stroke actuator, however, strain must be amplified while preserving power density. SatCon proposes to demonstrate an innovative actuator which uses local hydraulics to transform magnetostrictive strain into an arbitrarily long stroke. Magnetostriction generates pressurized fluid flow which powers a linear hydraulic actuator. The benefits of high performance hydraulics are retained without sacrificing the weight, redundancy, reliability, and simplicity of electric actuation. During Phase I, SatCon will develop a preliminary actuator design suitable for a cyclic/collective application. During Phase II, SatCon will detail design, fabricate, and bench test the actuator. Specifications will be as stated (3 inch stroke, 25 hp rating, and a reponse comparable to hydraulics). Alternate forms of electric power will be studied. Air cooling will be maximized.",

Terfenol-D, the \"giant strain\" magnetostrictive material is an excellent candidate to produce a high power density reaction-mass actuator for helicopter gearbox noise cancellation. Using magnetostrictives, the single axis actuator can meet the weight, volume and durability requirements, without compromising the force or freuency range specifications. In contrast to piezoelectric materials, magnetostrictive materials have seven times larger strain and fifteen times higher energy density, resulting in more actuation effort for the given mass and volume budget. Unlike piezoelectrics, magnetostrictives do not require high voltages to operate efficiently. Compared with piezoelectrics, magnetostrictives have greater reliability and longer life advantages. The proposed work is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a magnetostrictive driven reaction-mass actuator for helicopter gearbox noise cancellation. During Phase I, the objective is to design, fabricate, test, and deliver a high-force density, magnetostrictive-based reaction-mass actuator. This actuator shall be capable of exceeding the suggested specifications of over 100 pounds at frequencies between 1000 and 4000 Hz. During Phase II, this work will be extended to multi-degree-of-freedom designs.",

In addition, this laser design can produce high-energy pulses (0.1-1 J), short-duration pulses (<10 ns) and output in a good atmospheric transmission window (1500-1600 mm), all features that are important for the aerosol and cloud detection application, which we are addressing here. In this proposal we describe the recent experiments that support these claims, a plan for further laser development and a plan for subsequent field verification tests using a prototype lidar system that would be constructed during the Phase I project. In the proposed effort we would investigate means for improving/optimizing the intracavity OPO (IOPO) design that has recently been tested in our laboratory through a combination of experimental and computer-modeling work.

Determinations of obscurant cloud dimensions, locations, and centroids are often used for quantifying performance. To determine geometric cloud characterization parameters, current data reduction procedures require time-sensitive and potentially inconsistent manual (human) location of cloud perimeters from visible and infrared video imagery. The Phase I work plan proposes to identify both software and hardware components necessary to create an automated cloud perimeter location system. The plan seeks to integrate human cues into a knowledge base which will utilize image processing techniques and algorithms. The Phase I effort will also explore algorithms for the extraction of additional obscurant information, e.g., path radiance and cloud density, from the video imagery. Successful techniques and algorithms will be recommended for inclusion in the Phase II engineering of the perimeter detection system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments list nearly two hundred toxic materials that must be regulated. Among these are hydrazines, compounds that are used as rocket fuels. Air Force compliance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations will dictate the investigation and careful monitoring of the emissions of hydrazines to the atmosphere, particularly during the fueling and launching of rocket vehicles. However, current techniques to monitor atmospheric pollutants are not sensitive and specific enough to hydrazines to satisfy future EPA requirements. To fill this need, Science Research Laboratory (SRL) proposes to develop a portable interferometric pollution monitor (IPM) with the capability of measuring hydrazine and other pollutants in situ and continuously at the parts-per-trillion (ppt) level. The basis of this instrument is the interferometric measurement of the optical-path change that occurs immediately after a pulsed carbon-dioxide laser beam is absorbed by the pollutant present in one arm of the interferometer. An instrument that utilizes a line-tunable, pulsed carbon-dioxide laser can be tuned through the near-infrared absorption spectrum of hydrazines to determine their concentration in the presence of other absorptive species. An IPM will be sensitive to a concentration of several parts per trillion, orders of magnitude better than instruments based on other approaches to detect such toxic species. Such an instrument will be ideal for monitoring compliance with EPA regulations and for continuous measurement of the effectiveness of control processes that minimize the emission. The proposed Phase I feasibility study will be followed by a Government-sponsored proof-of-principle Phase II demonstration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The use of high energy (E ~ 1-5 MeV) electron beams (HEEB) at high average power (P ~ 50 kW - 1 MW) allows carbon-carbon (CC) composite components to be joined together and bonded to high-temperature metallic materials. HEEB joining utilizes deep-penetration volumetric heating to melt a thin, high-Z braze alloy interlayer. The localized power deposition raises the CC and braze temperatures only at the joint, permitting wetting and reliable joint formation. Traditional joining methods such as furnace brazing and mechanical techniques are not acceptable for production of CC thermal shields or CC-containing tubes for rocket exhaust applications. HEEB joining minimizes thermal expansion failure which can occur with furnace brazing and replaces ad-hoc joining. Science Research Laboratory (SRL) has developed a new generation of pulsed induction linear accelerators which allow reliable, cost efficient production of high average power electron beams with the necessary parameters for CC joining. A unique feature of these accelerators is the high repetition rate (>5000 pps) all-solid-state pulsed power drivers which make these accelerators scalable to MW power levels at an electron beam cost of less than $2/Watt. The induction accelerator technology developed by SRL is consistent with the power densities (300-3000 W/cm2) and beam energies (1-5 MeV) required for CC joining. A HEEB CC joining system based on this technology is described. Preliminary experiments in Phase I will demonstrate HEEB joining and determine joint reliability and strength. Process optimization and the fabrication of thin-walled tubes containing CC-refractory metal bonds are planned for Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Curing of glass or carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites using high energy electron beams (HEEB) offers impressive advantages for the fabrication of structural components in commercial and military vehicles. HEEB curing greatly reduces the time to cross-link the polymer matrix, while increasing composite tensile strength. The process simultaneously cures the matrix, adhesives and paints to bond together complete 200 lb vehicle \"skeleton\". Electron-beam-cured composite frames have the necessary stiffness for vehicle support, and can be produced at the high throughput rate necessary for commercial success. Science Research Laboratory (SRL) has developed a new generation of pulsed linear induction accelerators (LIA) which allow reliable, cost efficient production of high average power electron beams with the necessary parameters for high energy electron beam (HEEB) curing of advanced composites. Unique features of these accelerators include high repetition rate (> 5000 pps) all-solid-state pulsed power drivers which make these accelerators scalable to megawatt power levels at a capital cost for the accelerator of approximately $3/Watt. Phase I experiments will determine the electron beam parameters for efficient curing of novel resin formulations in automotive components. Results of curing experiments together with a design study will generate a preliminary plant design to combine HEEB curing with resin transfer molding of the entire RTM/HEEB process will then be carried out to compare composite parts cost with more traditional steel-based automotive parts. Anticipated Benefits: The high beam power and control of a HEEB curing system based on SRL induction accelerator technology will allow cost effective fabrication of reinforced thermoplastic composites for automotive and military applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Both commercial and military aircraft require certification to electromagnetic environments that are becoming increasingly more severe. In addition, modern aircraft increasingly employ lightweight composite panels, which have lower EM shielding properties and more sensitive electronics-making them more susceptable to EM environments. The time-tested method of verifying shielding integrity, the CW radiation test, is generally manpower intensive, costly, and has environmental problems (e.g., interference with airport communications). There is a need to develop a built-in-test (BIT) system which can, on demand, readily evaluate the electromagnetic hardness of the aircraft, compare to pre-determined \"safe\" levels, and report all problems requiring maintenance. We propose to design and develop a BIT system for monitoring aircraft shielding effectivensss using the Stochastic Process Test Technique (SPTT) developed under an earlier proof of concept program. Coupled with the emerging technologies such as micro-sensors, miniature breakout boxes, inexpensive high speed fiber optic data lines (FOL) and analog to digital converters (A/D), we believe that the proposed BIT system can be fully developed and productized within 3-5 years.",

In order to provide the Army with a viable non-lethal weapon SARA proposes an integrated program that will define, in addition to the beam generator technology, the optimum acoustic susceptabilities for equipment and personnel, propagation effects, as well as advanced phased array and nonlinear acoustic beam control to provide operator and helicopter platform safety/enhanced propoagation distances (~10 km). To provide a very high power, efficient and transportable weapon, SARA proposes acoustic source technology based upon pulsed and oscillating combustion. This helicopter weapon concept will provide a wide range of incapacitating non-lethal response options for the Army. SARA personnel combine the highly unique capabilities of high power acoustic beam devices, effects experience and directed energy weapons development. SARA has the unique position of having developed acoustic light arms incapacitation weapons the U.S. Army. We have a very strong capability in the design, development and testing of directed energy weapon hardware.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Many aerospace applications produce vast amounts of data that must be analyzed intelligently as rapidly as possible, often with near- real-time constraints. Examples include telemetry data from a variety of sources, scientific data from space missions, and design and performance data for complex devices. Extracting knowledge from such data is a demanding task requiring powerful computer hardware and appropriate software architectures. On the hardware side, there is growing interest in parallel computers, and especially in parallel \"hypercomputers\" that may be created from clusters of powerful RISC workstations, now available from many vendors and installed widely within NASA and the aerospace industry. This project addresses the software required for knowledge processing on distributed or parallel computers. Specifically, we will develop novel distributed knowledge processing software for workstation clusters and shared- or distributed-memory parallel computers embodying both hierarchical real-time data fusion and expert database capabilities. Such unified \"expert data fusion\" software should be uniquely capable of supporting both rapid analysis of evolving data streams and smart knowledge extraction from legacy data. By building the software so that it leverages existing tools, techniques, and databases, we will be able to deliver tremendous productivity increases to users in the aerospace community.",

Heat treatment is one of the most critical operations in manufacturing components of these materials. Problems such as unacceptable microstructure/properties, distortion, cracking, etc. during heat treatment processes have been the major obstacles preventing these materials from many potential applications in high performance energy conversion devices. This project will develop a computer modeling system for the heat treatment processes in manufacturing demanding structural components of high temperature materials. The objectives of the proposed Phase I work ar to define the functional requirements and to establish the theoretical foundation of a user friendly FEM-based computer simulation system for heat treatment of high temperature structural materials. The framework derived from this work will provide the basis on which a full scale implementation and integration will be performed in the Phase II work. OPTION TASK: $19,800",

Almost all of these active surge/stall controls have been proof-of-concept studies on laboratory-scale compressors or engines. A compelling need arises which is to evaluate all reported and new methods of active surge/stall control and to select the most feasible method for full engine demonstration. Scientific Monitoring, Inc. proposes to conduct a program of research on surge and rotating stall controls for turboshaft engines. Particularly, the research will emphasize a systematic trade study of various control methods and actuator/sensor combinations.

        "abstract": "Abstract         An autonomous system for making solar radiation measurements in the Arctic is proposed. Knowledge of both longwave and shortwave radiation is critical to understanding the heat transfer among the ice, atmosphere, and ocean, and therefore required to understand environmental change in the Arctic. Long term autonomous systems are planned to be deployed in the Arctic to measure a variety of environmental parameters. It is currently not possible to include radiation measurements in these system, simply, because there exists no power conserving system for keeping the radiometer domes clean. Blowing snow and ice crystals form a hard crust-like surface on the radiometer domes resulting in erroneous measurements. In recent field operations, radiometer domes needed to be cleaned as frequently as every hour. Here we propose to design, build, and test a stand-alone battery-powered system for recording radiometer data for periods up to one year. This system will include a low power consumption method for keeping the radiometers clean under Arctic conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Future NASA space missions call for unprecedented levels of precision and reliability. Space Structures like other engineering systems, will suffer from unexpected failures and environmental disturbances. Although a large number of control subsystems are used to nullify or ameliorate the effects of such events, a health monitoring and supervisory control system is required to constantly monitor the operating status of each of these subsystems. Whenever a failure is predicted, the supervisor will take corrective actions. A new technique is proposed here for health monitoring and supervisory control which combines techniques from the areas of Artificial Neural Nets (ANN) and Robust Stochastic Control Theory. The proposed Phase I effort will consist of the following tasks: (i) Identify and develop an architecture for the health monitoring and supervisory control system, (ii) Identify and develop techniques for detection and classification using ANN after preprocessing by Extended Kalman Filtering and Principal Component Analysis, (iii) Identify and develop techniques for adaptive reconfiguration of control under failure conditions, and (iv) Demonstrate the detection, classification and reconfiguration for a sensor/actuator failure on a NASA Test Article case study simulation. During Phase II, other types of failures will be considered and the software will be implemented on line and tested on a NASA Test Article.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A modern military fighter, such as an F-16, carries a multitude of different external store configurations through its design envelope. For certain configuration, flutter or limit cycle oscillations (LCO) restrict the maximum airspeed or the weapon release. As new weapons are introduced into the aircraft's inventory, radical changes may occur in the aircraft structural dynamics to thepoint of potentially encountering flutter. This potential requires an exhaustive certification process to define the flutter/LCO airspeed limit for each new store configuration. The payoffs associated with the removal of flutter speed restrictions include: increased survivability during war-time operations, increased flexibility in store selection, potential cost savings associated with reduced analyses and testing, and inherent reduction in risk associated with flight flutter test. The overall objective of Phase I is to design and test an on-line identification technique for adaptive structural mode suppression for F-16 aircraft. Specific tasks are: i)Acquisition of data and models for F-16 aircraft under different store configurations. (ii)On-line identification of structural modes using Stochastic Realization algorithm; (iii)Evaluation of sensor data and computational requirements for on-line identification of structural modes. Phase II will consist of hardware/software implementation and real-time testing of the robust control concepts bia nonlinear simulations incorporating both rigid body and flexible modes. Phase III will involve flight testing and commercialization. Lockheed Fort Worth Company will provide data and evaluation support during Phases I and II and commercialize the results dkuring Phase III.",

The wavelength of present state-of-the-art arrays would change by 35 nm over the same temperature range. In addition, the spectral width is reduced to less thatn 1 nm and wavelength sensitivity to optical feedback is eliminated. The array design will be consistent with proven reliabilt high temperature oepration of high power laser diodes demonstrated by SDL, where greater than 300 W QCW has been demonstrated. The design is fully compatible with existing bar packaging and stacking schemes and does not require any active heating or cooling to achieve the proposed temperature insensitivity. The temperature insensitive bar is expected to significantly impact applications using diode-pumped solid state lasers by dramatically reducing the cost and weight of cooling the diodes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         NASA has recently launched an initiative to rejuvenate the general aviation (GA) industry in the United States by stimulating and coordinating R&D; in key technical areas. The central goal of this effort is to create a new generation of GA aircraft which are very easy to fly and as affordable as a luxury automobile. The new NASA general aviation initiative seeks revolutionary improvements in GA aircraft, especially in avionics and other cockpit systems. This proposal for an integrated datalink and data management system provides radical improvements in GA Aircraft data communications and data management, in order to enable a central theme of the GA initiative: improved situational awareness. Situational awareness concepts are enabled by providing access to critical information from the ground, on-board databases and other aircraft. There are three especially important innovations provided by this effort: 1) It designs a GPS-based traffic surveillance sensor, 2) It establishes the first data communications and management standard for GA aircraft, and 3) It develops a process for pre-certifying avionics software components. These innovations enable lower costs, which ensure affordability for GA aircraft. The work is directly related to this subtopic's stated needs for situational awareness, datalink systems and reduced certification costs.",

These consequences-to-be-avoided are termed \"hazards.\" The approach is based upon the idea that it is hazard, rather than error, that should be avoided. It is impossible to prevent all errors; attempting to do so will interfere with learning and innovation in a crisis. The proposed hazard monitor (HM) models pilot activities that can lead to dangerous situations. It used human-centered methods to help pilots avoid danger without taking authority or responsibility from the pilot. Errors are modeled as failed expectations associated with stages of an on-going task; tasks are moeled as sequences of situations. Serious hazards only occur after a swquence of situations that all contain increasingly dangerous failed expectations. A study of pilot activities, pilot errors, and iaircraft hazards along with an examination of current error mitigation techniques is proposed, the results of which will be used to design an aviation hazared monitor.",

The standard source of propulsion thermodynamics is the NASA Lewis CEC code, which describes the thermodynamics of multicomponent, ideal gases in the temperature range of 300 to 5000 @K. There are currently many important propulsion problems, that the proposed analyses would address, which lie outside this range of restrictions. Also, there are currently no systematic studies to generalize CEC type codes. Real fluid thermodynamics and transport properties including phase changes, combustion kinetics, and turbulent mixing modules will be produced as a result of this study. CFD codes are widely used to investigate propulsion problems, because they are not limited in the fluid properties or geometries used to describe the system. The proposed innovation would improve existing CFD methodology with a minimum cost and effort by providing better property descriptions in the new submodels which will be developed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In today's society, computers are being interconnected at ever increasing rates - with an apparent goal of seamless global communication. One of the last roadblocks restricting the formation of one globally inter- connected network is the fear of malicious hackers invading protected islands of information, stealing secrets and reaking havoc with an expensive information base. Because of this fear, network architects will continue to use physical isolation or restricted flow of services. Unfortunately for network administrators, these (semi-) isolated networks are usually too large to administer on a hands-on basis and are beyond the capabilities of net management protocols such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP). Phase I of this effort is to identify techniques for implementing network management protocols in a multi-level secure environment, through the use of Type Enforcement and cryptographic techniques. Phase II of this effort will focus on the development of these protocols iinpleniented on the LOCK computer platform. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - This proposal will examine techniques for implementing network management in MLS networks through a combination of high-grade cryptography and a relatively new security mechanism called Type Enforcement (TE). The combination of these two mechanism permits network management protocols to achieve a global view of the network while still protecting the sensitive information encountered on these networks.",

The requirement is to analyze considerable amounts of data concerning the enemy, common and allied force situation and provide results in a form useful for quality decision making in a short period of time. Due to the complexities of mission planning, these systems will becom more autonomous, with a man-in-the-loop to override, correct errors and to monitor performance. Short timelines and semi-autonomous operations pose a classic challenge to the artificial intellegence community to explore new and innovative adaptive information processing approaches that minimize reliance on heuristic or ad hoc techniques. Networks of dynamically programmable logic modules (DPLM networds) appear promising in such areas as pattern recognition and classification, signal processing, and robotics. One specific requirement is to develop new parallel processing techniques to support target planning applications. The objective fo the proposed Phase I project is to demonstrate that a genetic algorithm can be used to evolve DPLM network software to support complex target planning applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         High spatial resolution imagery from geo-stationary orbit places uncompromising demands on spacecraft stabilization and optical system thermal stability. GEO requires + 8.80 pointing FOR, 1.25 urad IFOV (10's of urad accuracy) and < 1 urad (rms) jitter at ~ 10 Hz rate. Prior solutions have combined complex and costly ACS/IMU/Stellar control of spacecraft jitter with detector oversampling and image motion compensation (IMC). The problem is heightened for limited weight MicroSpacecraft sensors with increased excitation bandwidth and lack of on-board control capability. Ultra-lightweight, thermally stable silicon carbide optics and advanced servo control systems permit large aperture pointing and high precision stabilization in one lightweight assembly. The core innovation of combining these technologies removes the tight slewing and jitter requirements from the spacecraft and IMC from the ground station; complexity, weight and cost are dramatically reduced. This program will develop a 0.5m aperture, high precision SiC pointing and stabilization mirror assembly including servo control electronics. Phase I will provide the conceptual design and analysis of a prototype unit and a hardware demonstration of an advanced 6\" x 9\" SiC mirror in an existing 2 urad pointing system. The closed back SiC mirror, replacing a beryllium mirror, has superior thermal stability, stiffness and strength. Phase II will provide the development and test of a flight qualifiable advanced pointing assembly for GEO; a wide range of micro-spacecraft such as Quick LAWS and commercial remote sensors and imagers are supported.",

Techniques must be general enough to consider pulse rise time, total energy, and duration. Treatment must be general neough to work for aircraft, sensor pods, missiles, and satellites. Coupling through antennas, sensors, leaky gaskets, and hatches must be permitted. Contractor proposes to treat the exterior coupling, the RF points of entry, the internal RF response, the internal RF coupling to cables and circuits, and the circuit response as associated, but mostly separate, problems, although the last two aspects probably require simultaneous treatment. Feasibility studies will be made for different approaches to each of these five sub-problems. At present, our inclination is that the external problem may be treated deterministically, but the internal response can only be treated statistically.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Metal additives to explosive formulations are commonly used in high energy military and commercial explosives, solid fuel rocket propellants and military and commercial pyrotechnics. Aluminum metal is a stable low cost fuel that is typically used in the form of powder or flake. In high energy systems the energy of the balst and the velocity of the detonation wavefront can be limited by the utilization efficiency and oxidation reaction rate of the aluminum powder. In this work a composite aluminum powder will be developed that has the potential of extremely high reaction rates, full utilization of the aluminum material and the future potential for an Integrated Fuel System, that incorporates additional fuel and or oxidizer in a single powder particle. A patented ultra high speed vacuum process will be used to produce a material that is composed of tens of throusands of submicron aluminum layers separated by submicron polymer layers. a composite aluminum particle can have tens or even hundreds of very thin aluminum layers, resulting in a very high surface to volume ratio, that will increase the reaction rate and oxidation efficiency. The polymer materials are thrermally and mechanically stable and can incorporate functionalities that can aid or control the detonation process. The composite powder can have a variable density, it has superior environmental stability, and it is relativly safe to handle. In the Phase I work powders with select polymers and different aluminum to polymer ratios will be produced and will be therochemically characterized. Samples will also be supplied to the HERD group for evaluation. In Phase II the polymer material and the aluminum to polymer ratio will be optimized for specific appliances and pilot production samples will be supplied for evaluation to the HERD group and commercial explosives and solid fuel propellant manufacturers.",

The purpose of this project is to improve the performance of the acoustic sensors by cancelling or reducing the vehicle noise appearing in them, through the application of multi-channel noise cancellation. Others have previously tried to accomplish this by application of the classic Widrow algorithm for multichannel noise cancellation. The Principal Investigator of Signal Separation Technologies (SST) also has previously attempted to apply the classical algorithm, in his case to the elimination of tow cable strum induced vibration noise appearing in a Navy towed array sonar. Finding the classic algorithm to be theoretically and practically deficient for multichannel noise cancelling application, he augmented the algorithm to make it work correctly. This new method, termed the Signal-free Reference - Singular-value Decomposition (SFR-SVD method), was able to solve the sonar vibration noise cancelling problem. This method will be applied to the vehicle noise problem, and should yield similar benefits.",

The proposed project is an application of these micromachined accelerometers to build a system that measures and stores three orthogonal acceleration components for a period of up to 24 hours. It will be a smart system with the software flexibility needed to adapt it for a range of applications. The proposed design will contain three accelerometers together with a microprocessor, several other off-the-shelf low-power CMOS parts and a single semicustom IC. In Phase I we will develop the details of the design. A design review will be conducted at the completion of Phase I. In a Phase I extension and Phase II we propose to move rapidly to build, test and deliver completed units to NASA. In Phase III we propose to add these units and modified versions of these units to our product line for the instrumentation marketplace and to license the technology to one or more systems companies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Many optical computing problems are centered around the processing of incoherent images. These images may be conventional visible light such as those taken with a CCD imager or camcorder. They may also take the form of infrared images in the case of missle seekers or x-ray images from medical or other sources. For optical processing, these images must be converted to either phase or amplitude modulated coherent light. This is typically accomplished by electronically feeding the originally captured image into a spatial light modulator (e.g., liquid crystal or deformable mirror array) and modulating a coherent reference beam with the 2 dimensional data pattern. The electrical input to the SLM creates a data flow bottleneck in the optical processing system due to the inherently serial input architecture. SMD proposes a novel incoherent to coherent image converter which solves this problem by providing a massively parallel, optical input feed capability, utilizing a novel combination of micromachining and ultra-thinned wafer technology to achieve an integrated incoherent to coherent image converter.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         High-speed, large area detector arays are needed for recording fast events in both military and commercial applications. Deblurring of high-velocity targets within an image require extremely short exposure times. Short exposure times in turn, reduce the time availble for photon intergration and, because of increased amplifier bandwidths, result in higher noise levels at the CCD sense node. The desire to take high quality (high-speed) images under ambient lighting conditions imposes a need to optimize both the light gathering capability of the individual photosites and the sensitivity of the CCD output amplifier. Previous efforts at reducing sense node capacitance have been hampered by either physical constraints of the fabrication process, or band-width limitations imposed by using lightly oped drain techniques. Deblurring of high-speed events typically equires interline transfer CCD designs which allow for high-speed shuttering capability, but severely limit the detector element's light gathering capability. SMD proposes an alternative imaging architecture which optimizes both photosite and amplifier sensitivity through the use of novel micromachining techniques. The modified amplifier and photosite structure promises to achieve charge to voltage conversion gains of l00 to 200 microvolts per electron.",

Due to the limitation of traditional 2D sensor array technologies such as machine vision and laser dimensional measurement equipment, multiple views of the chip and its fillets must be taken for flaw detection and analysis. These methods require intensive image processing and is time consuming. High Speed Panoramic Inspection System (HSPIS) combines coherent image guide technology, structured illumination, panoramic image translation algorithm, machine vision and computer interface technologies into a system that \"unfolds\" a 360 degree view of an object into a 2D image array. This technique has two major benefits: (a) it improves current automated inspection speed by at least 400% and, (b) a portable or downloadable Panoramic Image Translation Function Library consisting of microelectronics flaw detection routines will be developed and available for other vision systems. With the support of Brunswick, this technique will be applied (Tech-Transfer) to surface inspection of composite launch tubes and miniaturized pressured vessels as well. The HSPIS will be integrated as an automated inspection system which can inspect all sides of a component in a 30 milliseconds time frame.

This sensor technology is non-contact, can monitor minute drifting of manufacturing processes in microseconds, to the precision of 0.02 microns, and will have the intelligence to provide feedbacks for real-time dimensional control of microelectronics manufacturing processes. Other sensors such as Micro-Leveling Sensors and Illumination Calibration Sensors will also be developed under this proposed effort. These added sensors will complement the previously developed sensors to support the entire spectrum of sensor needs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The work proposed here is to develop and demonstrate software that provides a simulation of optical surface errors produced during manufacturing processes that use tubular grinding. The softwae will be designed with refernece to the Opticam SM and SX precision grinding machines. The tubular grinding process used in the Opticam machines is a deterministic method that promises to enable concurrent engineering of optical elements in an agile manufacturing environment. Unlike conventional optical manufacturing processes that require extensive hand work, Opticam technology produces optical surfaces having shapes that are accurately determined by the geometry of the grinding machine. Surface errors produced during tubular grinding are closely related to the relative alignment of the tool and workpiece. This makes it possible to predict the errors produced by various types of misalignment, and thereby make it possible to correct the alignment of the machine by inspecting a manufactured part. In Phase I, we will develop and demontsrate prototype software for predicting such surface errors, formulate the concpet of interfacing to commericlaly available optical design software, and formulate the concept for making the software an integral part of the Opticam manufacturing process.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Damond is the best known material for wear resistance coatings. Even though several U.S. companies ahve successfully entered into various diamond thin film markets with CVD grown films, we have not yet seen widely used commercial wear resistance diamond coatings. The major problem for such applications is that one cannot achieve both economic and good wear resistance coatings with the currently predominant microwave CVD technique. In order to have economical competativeness, at least a factor of 10 times increase in the deposition rate thatn the current rate is required, such an increase in deposition rate while maintaining high film quality is not likely to be accomplished in near future using present methods. The direct C- ion beam deposition (IBD) process has demonstrated superior properties in adhesion, low friction surfaces, and film uniformity becuase the nucleation occurs uniformly across the surface due to the intrisic high energy of the C- ion beam (50-100 eV). The current large area ion sources also have difficulties in commercial applications because of its low deposition rate (~1um/hr). We proposed to develop an innovative IBD process which promises to deliver depostion rates up to 100 um/hr with our novel way of producing C- ion beams. We are proposing the development of a unique rectlinear C- ion beam source design which is capable of making deposition in any length with depostion rate of the order of 100um/hr for the beam area. In a test system we have demonstrated scratch resistant, morphologically smooth, and transpoarent diamong like films. In phase I, a 2: C- ion beam source will be developed and its successful production of DLC thin films will demonstrate the feasibility of the ion beam technique for various large scale war resistant coatings. In phase II, an industrial leve 10\" C- IBD system will be developed.",

The design utilizes bulk swirl and is based on a Variable Residence Time (VRT) concept which allows large fuel particles adequate time to completely burn in the circumferentially mixed primary zone. High durability of the combustor is achieved by dual function use of the incoming air. Due to the method of circumferential air admission, it is ideally suited to very high inlet air velocities with minimum losses which will result in an improved cycle efficiency and a lower engine specific fuel consumption. SOL-3 Resources proposes to apply the VRT combustor concept to an advanced small engine currently under development. The support of the major engine manufacturer has already been obtained.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Information Distribution System concept provides the framework for establishment, distribution, and maintenance of object oriented databases within the future Army tactical command and control systems. This concept requires rules that completely describe the needs for combat information at each individual database maintained within the system, processes that locally compute updated values from the data in these databases, and triggers that permit data distribution based upon deviations from the computed norm. This effort will focus on the development of a toolkit of procedures to permit construction of the sets of rules, processes and triggers needed for generation and timely update of the Army tactical command and control systems databases. The SONEX approach centers on the utilization of Object-Oriented and Intelligent reconfigurable software engineering technologies. Through these technologies distributed data systems can be developed more efficiently and will be more reliable and maintainable. To ensure the tool kits performance test bed design will also be a critical part of this project. Test methodologies that will be investigated include statistical analysis and modeling techniques.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The purpose is to develop a wideband, quantitative shock wave hydrophone made of the piezoelectric material polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). The novel aspects of this device include a low-cost disposable hydrophone element to significantly reduce the per-shot costs, and a self- monitoring system that informs the user when the hydrophone element has lost a specified accuracy and should be replaced. These hydrophones will be designed to fulfill the requirements for accurate, wideband measurement of lithotripter fields, suitable for quantitative biophysical research or Food and Drug Administration submissions. The disposable feature of the hydrophone system will make it cost effective for research, quality assurance and regulatory submissions. Phase I will focus on: l) investigating the effect of shock wave exposure on hydrophone elements; 2) developing the wideband preamplifier and hydrophone monitoring systems; 3) refining the means for rapid, reliable electrical connection to the disposable hydrophone elements; and 4) investigating low-cost fabrication techniques for the disposable elements. When fully developed under Phases II and III, the Disposable Lithotripsy Hydrophone will represent a new standard reference for the measurement and evaluation of lithotripsy systems, applicable to clinical quality assurance and lithotripter inter-comparison.",

The program content will focus on dietary habits to reduce cancer risk; this focus is consistent with NCI recommendations. As a basis for designing a half-hour audio presentation, in-depth focus group interviews will ascertain awareness and preconceptions of this topic by members of the target population. A test-versus-control experiment will then compare a subject's knowledge and attitudes before exposure to the audiotape with those after exposure. A pilot study of 300 young Americans will test if exposure to the production can (a) increase awareness in the target population of the importance of eating \"cancer-protective\" foods, (b) impart related skills of food selection and preparation, (c) alter attitudes about the relationship between foods we eat and our cancer risk, (d) predispose listeners to modify their diets accordingly.The test will also measure the extent to which young adults respond to cassettes as an information medium on this topic.",

The objective of the Phase I program to use demonstrate the advantageous use of the above mentioned innovative technique in the ion thruster PCU. A full scale breadboard with all the key components will be constructed to evaluate the proposed approach. Weight and size estimate of the flight system will also be made based on the breadboard performance. The successful result of the Phase II program will be a flight qualifiable ion thruster PCU that has a good potential to meet the need of the microspacecraft for solar system exploration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The More Electric Aircraft initiative will replace conventional hydraulic actuators, which are cooled by their centralized hydraulic oil circuit, by discrete electromechanical or electrohydraulic units which are not part of a centralized system. This will introduce a critical localized thermal management issue in the cooling of these advanced actuators and other components. A proposed integrated thermal management system for these components is simple, reliable, lightweight, has a high heat capacity and is totally passive. The proposed concept includes the use of a resin matrix composite heat transfer structure with high thermal conductivity graphite fibers, to provide high in-plane thermal conductivity for effective heat removal from the actuator to the vehicle skin or other heat sink. The concept also uses an innovative approach with embedded high thermal conductivity fibers to improve the short-transverse direction thermal conductivity of the composite structure. In addition, the concept integrates thermal energy storage materials within the composite structure to allow for short-term peak power operation. In the Phase I program the feasibility of this innovative concept will be analytically demonstrated and subelement articles demonstrating key design features will be fabricated and tested. Potential applications in the MEA program and other areas will be identified, and a plan for continued development will be prepared.",

Currently, this done as a tedious manual process that is inefficient and expensive. Without more efficient methods, valuable scientific software may be discarded as mainframe computers are phased out. Spectra Research, Inc. (S*R) proposes to develop the Visual Porting Executive for Windows (VP*Exec) to solve this problem. VP*Exec will automate the process of converting analysis code, and generating GUI tools to control program execution, setup inputs, configure output, and provide data visualization. S*R will reuse software developed on a U.S. Army Phase II SBIR to implement much of the VP*Exec software. A innovative Code Analyzer capable of determining the input and output parameters through a sequential process of scanning and analyzing the FORTRAN code will be developed. S*R's highly experienced software team will develop a prototype demonstration during Phase I. S*R research has indicated that a strong market exists for VP*Exec and plans to begin commercialization the product during Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Maintenance of US air superiority requires that current and future combat aircraft be equipped to counter an increasing diversity of aircraft and missiles. One cost-effective response to this requirement is the use of both computer and hardware simulation to test the response of US electronic warfare (EW) systems to different threats and engagement scenarios. Hardware EW simulations are conducted in shielded anechoic chambers both to control the test environment and to conceal the test scenarios from electronic intelligence gathering by potential adversaries. Historically, most laboratory tests of EW systems have used direct insertion of the simulated threat signals into the receivers of the system under test. Advanced airborne intercept radars currently under development use electronically steered arrays to passively locate and track other aircraft by their electromagnetic emissions. The need exists for a dynamic target simulator which emits signals that accurately simulate the signals from a distant moving target within the constraints of an RF anechoic chamber. S*R proposes to meet this requirement with a Radiated Direction of Arrival Simulator (RDAS) utilizing an array of antennas to simulate one or more moving emitters within the field of view of the passsive airborne intercept radar.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The need to recycle solid plastic waste is becoming increasingly acute in view of the limited availability of both landfill space in which to dump plastic trash and the petroleum reserves needed to replace discarded material.  The National Research Council has identified the need for a rapid and reliable means of chemically identifying plastics as a Critical Technology.  Without such a means of identification, it will not be possible to reprocess the billions of pounds of plastics that are being landfilled or incinerated every year.  This Phase II proposal builds on Phase I success to offer a new spectroscopic device that is able to positively identify the chemical composition of plastic waste containers and scraps at rates that could ultimately exceed one-hundred pieces per second.  This innovation in essence can be described as a Molecular Bar-Code Reader.  The effort proposed will put Phase-I-proven principals into practice by building commercial prototype devices from rapid plastic identification using laser spectroscopy coupled with advanced optical signal generation, separation, and detection technologies.  The end result of Phase II R&D; will be three functioning plastic identification systems:  (1) A transportable system with hand-held read head, (2) a battery-powered portable hand-held unit, and (3) An OEM sensor prototype for use in automated solid-waste sorting.  These systems will be suitable for field testing and demonstration to secure Phase III support and establish a solid technology base for commercialization.",

In Phase I Spire will attempt to deposit ErAs epitaxially on GaAs by low pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (LP-MOCVD) and measure its electrical properties.

Surface coatings have been shown to be effective in reducing this wear, but each metal alloy system requires a different treatment. Spire's ion implantation process has been used effectively to reduce titanium wear through direct treatment of titanium surfaces and to reduce UHMWPE wear through treatment of mating Co-Cr surfaces. This proposal strives to continue Spire's leadership in this field by combining the beneficial properties of the metal with the desired wear properties of a ceramic. Hardened ceramic coatings will reduce wear and will have immediate commercial impact with significant benefits to younger patients who would have to use these devices for extended periods. Zirconia is a biocompatible, hard ceramic with good wear and lubricity. It can be uniformly applied on intricate surfaces by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at low temperatures. We will test this coating on cobalt-chromium coupons for wear reduction of UHMWPE mating pieces. Coating uniformity, adhesion, and other relevant physical properties will be determined. Success in Phase I will lead to tests on actual hip components in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Improved energy density capacitors are needed to reduce the size of spacecraft components. Current performance (-2 J/cm3) is limited by processing technology and not by inherent material properties. Spire proposes to use metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) with spray injection of reactants (aerosol combustion) to achieve high dielectric constant, high breakdown strength insulators capable of capacitively storing more than 400 J/cm3. Optimization of the position where reactants are volatilized (on the substrate surface, just off the surface, far from the surface) is necessary for rapid growth of a defect free film, the key to success in this program. Existing research with reactants in the vapor phase has demonstrated the material properties needed for capacitors with dimensions on the scale of integrated circuit devices (operation at under 10 volts and few square microns area). In Phase I, Spire will demonstrate that the technology can be extrapolated to larger devices, specifically fabricating a 1 kV, one microfarad capacitor with low dielectric loss and low leakage current. Specific NASA applications, aside from miniaturized power units, would include significant reduction in weight and volume for capacitors such as those used to power plasma thrusters.",

While electrodes that permit graduated neural activation would yield better control, they cannot now be fabricated in the form of a safe and practical cuff. This limitation has recently been overcome by investigators at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), who have demonstrated selective activation of nerves in animals with a self-wrapping spiral cuff electrode of patented design. The CWRU electrodes are now fabricated one-at-a-time in a laborious, time consuming series of manual operations whose output is small and product in unreliable; to fully realize the benefits of CWRU's innovation, an improved, mass-producible versions must be developed. Such an electrode is the subject of Spire's proposal. Ion beam assisted deposition will be used to place a thin, patterned, highly adherent, conducting film on silicone rubber. This approach will allow reliable, repeatable production of the spiral cuff electrode design and make possible designs with smaller features and more stimulating surfaces. Prototype cuffs will be manufactured in Phase I. In Phase II, we will further refine the fabrication process and test the electrodes in extensive, long-term animal studies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Spire proposes to investigate unique, linear, sensitive, optically triggered, electronic switches that will enable new progress in antenna switching and reconfiguration and in microwave control. Such devices are dual-use technology, desired by both defense and commercial antenna manufacturers. California Microwave, Inc., an antenna company, is actively seeking a practical implementation of such switches, trademarked as \"Photistors,\" for its implementation of a synaptic antenna. California Microwave has identified required switching characteristics, and has encouraged Spire to develop these much needed devices. Photistor-devices are photoconductors made in very pure (background concentration = 10(12) cm-3) , high-lifetime semiconductors. High purity results in extremely high OFF \"dark\" resistance, while simultaneously allowing a low ON resistance under weak light due to the high material lifetime. Photogenerated carrier concentrations 1000 times higher than the dark background are the goal. Most photoconductors of recent interest use amorphous, semi-insulating, or ion-implanted-precipitate material, which results in lower minority carrier lifetime than pure material. This increases speed and resistivity at the price of decreased sensitivity, higher required optical power, and non-linear IVs. In contrast, Photistor-devices are made in near-perfect semiconductor material to achieve the highest carrier lifetime, light sensitivity, and lowest background concentration (highest OFF/ON ratio) possible with linear I-V curves to avoid harmonic generation by the RF antenna currents. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Photistor-devices are linear, very light-sensitive, optically triggered electronic switches with applications in antenna switching, antenna reconfiguration, microwave control, high voltage switching, and opto- isolation. Such devices are dual-use technology, and should be very useful to defense and commercial antenna manufacturers and to manufacturers needing control of high voltage equipment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         An innovative integrated optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer voltage sensor is proposed for fabrication in a lithium niobate substrate. The novel feature of this sensor is that one leg of the interferometer is reverse poled by selective ferroelectric domain inversion techniques. This feature permits simple electrode structures for high voltage sensing without the need for voltage division. Optical fibers link the voltage sensor to the power distribution control system. Since the optical fibers and the sensor are comprised of dielectric materials, the electrical isolation problems between the high voltage system and the control system are eliminated. The optical fiber and sensor are immune to electromagnetic interference and, thus, yield accurate measurements over a wide dynamic range. This voltage sensor would be ideally suitable for automatic control of space or aeronautic power management and distribution systems. During the Phase I effort, SRICO proposes to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of the integrated optic voltage sensor for electric power distribution systems. Compact, low-cost, radiation- and fault-tolerant sensors could be produced using this technology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Ground based laser power beaming system (1-10 MW) can be effectively utilized in the near future as a primary component of a Laser Thermal Propulsion (LTP) system for an orbital transfer vehicle. A hybrid propulsion system is proposed which includes the components of a Solar Thermal Propulsion (STP) system. There is a high degree of commonality between the hardware, configuration, function, and materials design of an STP and LTP system. Specific Impulse (Isp's) on the order of 1200 seconds with reasonable thrust levels can be achieved with LTP utilizing smaller optics and similar absorber designs of STP. Previous research with interference-based techniques, specifically holographic concentrators, can become practical with LTP. Holography enables the concentrator designed an additional degree of design freedom by allowing arbitrary choice of the ratio between angles of incidence and reflection. LTP advantages over STP include increased energy capture because of a higher energy density than the solar disk, higher energy concentration due to the coherent light and smaller optics as a result of an intense transmission beam. The Phase I effort will demonstrate feasibility of a deployable laser concentrator for LTP using a hologram as the reflective element.",

A need exists for a user-friendly computer modeling tool which is capable of analyzing many air breathing propulsion system cycles efficiently. Human factors studies have been performed for real-time interactive computer displays for DoD systems. The technologies resulting from these real-time display designs can be used to produce an optimal graphical interface which will provide a means for interactive design and/or modification of air breathing propulsion systems. To enhance the utility of the interface, the analysis tool will operate using Windows on IBM-compatible PC computes. The propulsion system features will be selected from a comprehensive database that contains libraries of scalable cycle components, using the windows interface. Optimizing to a particular design requires parametric studies utilizing multiple combinations of components leading to excessive simualtion time when using antiquated methodologies. A human engineered windows graphical interface design will enable the user to perform parametric studies in an efficient and effective manner while examining and printing numerous cycle output plots.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A major difficulty in properly treating burn patients is the inability to reliably differentiate full dermal thickness burns, which should be excised and grafted, from partial thickness burns, which will heal within a few weeks without excision. Recently, the use of an intravenously injected florescent dye illuminated with 800 nm infrared radiation has been shown in animal experiments to provide a clear differentiation between full and partial thickness burns. The flashlamp source which produces the infrared illumination, however, has limited discrimination ability and little practical utility in clinical applications because of its lack of spectral purity, spatial uniformity, and spectral intensity. Preliminary experiments performed using a Star Medical Technologies (SMT) high energy diode array laser (5 millijoules in 5 milliseconds) indicate that a diode array laser illuminator can remedy these major dificiencies. Design studies indicate that a compact, hand-held diagnostic unit can be built and inexpensively produced. SMT proposed to perform the experiments necessary to validate this diagnostic approach and gather the critical design data necessary for the construction of a clinical prototype.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The purpose of this program is to demonstrate a novel approach to condition-based diagnosis and life management for gas-turbine engines. The long term goal is to eliminate heavy, labor intensive on-board computer hardware by using \"educated\", aircraft-specific, neural network computer \"chips\" of diagnostic software, capable of intelligent interpretation of both engine sensor signals and aerothermal performance details. The proposed approach uses recent advances in neural network technology, finite element based rotor dynamic analysis, and throughflow performance analysis. Phase I will involve the development of neural software for structural diagnosis of gas turbine engines and the demonstrtion of this software for engine diagnostic purposes using a physical rotating model. This work will demonstrate how dedicated finite element modeling and select engine measurements may serve as the \"brains\" for a neural network based diagnostic system. Engine performance aspects will be accomplished with the same neural network approach by replacing the finite element model with an engine performance model. During Phase II, prototype aircraft monitor will be developed in conjunction with Rolls-Royce Incorporated by extending the principles demonstrated in Phase I. The neural network based system will be \"trained\" in the dynamic and mechanical behavior of an engine, and in the engine performance characteristics as determined by aerothermal cycle synthesis. The prototype system will provide the USAF with demonstrated, real-time estimates of remaining component life and of engine performance for a select engine, based on real-time, updated behavior during operation.",

We will enhance the Navy's data analysis capabilities through the application of similarity-based techniques coupled with data reduction techniques. Finally, we will develop a model for integration of existing and emerging flight test planning software, expert systems, data base management systems and data reduction systems. Navy flight test planning has not previously been comprehensively automated and no one before has applied similarity-based techniques to flight test plan development.

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose an innovative combination of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to meet NASA's scheduling needs for representation, schedule design and schedule analysis. We will use AI knowledge representations including frames, semantic networks and rules for capturing schedule components and constraints. We will facilitate schedule design and reactive planning through the use of the intelligent entities concept and similarity-based and constraint satisfaction techniques, techniques we have used with much success for NASA's high-level manifest planning. We will enhance NASA's schedule analysis capabilities through the application of AI constraint-based techniques, capture and implementation of heuristic analysis techniques and standard graph negotiation techniques. NASA will benefit from improved schedule maintenance, display and analysis capabilities. The goals of the Phase I research are to thoroughly define the planning domain, elaborate the artificial intelligence techniques useful for automating the scheduling problem, prove the feasibility of these techniques, and develop a complete system specification for an automated NASA scheduler. Phase I research and prototype development will lay the groundwork for the Phase II implementation of an automated scheduling and analysis system and the eventual commercialization of a reactive planning system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         An important factor of monitoring processes, testing parts which have been in service for extended times, or performing intelligence on new materials from other countries is identification of material composition and internal structure. A common approach to this task involves destructive testing in which the object under test is taken apart and analyzed to reveal internal structure and material composition. Ultrasound, X-ray, or other similar forms of testing can provide internal structure, but do not identify material composition. Also, such techniques cannot be used for remote identification. All materials, however, posses relatively unique spectral reflectances, emittances, and transmittances. Internal structure gives rise to similarly unique spatially varying heat capacities and thermal conductivities. These parameters together give rise to unique, spatially varying spectral radiances which properly exploited can be used both to identify material composition and internal structure. An instrument designed to exploit spectral radiances would be an invaluable tool for non-destructive test and identification. Proposed is a development effort aimed at developing an instrument capable of collecting high spectral resolution images, nominally from about 3 microns to about 12 microns, but potentially down to about 0.35 microns. These images, comprising 256 x 256 spatial pixels, are collected at 600 frames per second, calibrated and processed in real-time with massively powerful yet extremely compact electronics to elicit material composition and structural integrity.",

A natural and arguably necessary extension to image-guidedneurosurgery workstations is the ability to integrate real-time ultrasound imagery into the intra-operativelocalization process. This functionality is motivated by two elements: 1) the need for the neurosurgeonto monitor intra-operative diagnostic imagery and relate these images to presurgical diagnostic imagery(MRI/CT) and localization information, and 2) the need to track the brain shift that may occur during aneurosurgical procedure and to correct presurgical diagnostic imagery to accurately reflect this brainshift. We will complete the laboratory studies and will perform the preliminary clinical studies necessaryto validate the technical and clinical feasibility of a stereotactic ultrasound system that will be integratedinto the NeuroStation . The stereotactic ultrasound system will consist of a custom-designed ultrasoundunit for stereotactic neurosurgery that will intra-operatively provide localized ultrasonography, registeredmultimodal (CT/MRI/Ultrasound) visualization, 3D ultrasound datasets. and brain-shift correction forpre-surgical CT/MRI datasets. This type of stereotactic ultrasound system will very likely become astandard accessory for image-guided neurosurgical systems.",

Because of this, there may be time periods for which the system performance can be enhanced, if the coolers are shut down. One method of allowing for system shut down is to provide an alternate passive cooling source for the sensors. SAI proposed to develop a closed system Phase Change Material Device (PCMD). This device will provide 750 Joules of cooling at 60 Degrees Kelvin for one half hour. Once developed, by varying the fill pressure, the Phase Change Temperature (operating temperature) can be varied over a small range. Additionally, other operating ranges (i.e., 10 to 20 K and 40 to 80 K) can be provided by changing the working fluid. This device can be utlized in either ground and/or space applications.",

The bearing also offers improvements in power consumption, controllability, manufacturability, and packaging. The Phase I objectives are to demonstrate the feasibility with proof-of-concept tests, trade studies, and preliminary design engineering. It is anticipated that the bearing will offer clear advantages for high temperature gas turbine systems. In Phase II, the bearing will be demonstrated as a full-scale prototype. The applications of interest to NASA in Phase III include high performance aircraft and spacecraft propulsion systems, vibration isolation systems, and rotordynamic test facilities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Benzodiazepines are in clinical use as antianxiety agents and are controlled substances. Prolonged use may be habit forming. Benzodiazepine abuse is a widespread problem. There is a practical need to screen for the presence of benzodiazepines and their metabolites. Oxazepam glucuronide is the final metabolite of oxazepam and related benzodiazepines in humans and other species. It may be used in the area of drug screening to establish a protocol which will be simpler, faster and more reliable than the method in current use which requires a hydrolysis step. This project proposes to explore the chemical synthesis of oxazepam glucuronide. The synthesis research will include a. preparation of the proper protected sugar moieties, b. coupling reactions between oxazepam and the protected sugar moieties, and c. conversion of coupling compounds into oxazepam glucuronide. The success of the proposed project will provide a new commercial product for forensic chemistry and will lead to the establishment of a new testing method which will have obvious advantages over the present hydrolysis- extraction method. The knowledge from the successful research will be useful for the synthesis of glucuronides of benzodiazepines and other drugs.",

In order to accomplish this objective, existing military and civilian HUD technology will be surveyed to determine what might be available for use in the existing E-2C cockpit without major airframe interruptions. At least three candidate systems will be selected for presentation, with their particular rationales, in report format. The Phase I work plan will assay the merits of a head-up display (HUD) for the E-2C in terms of six key display characteristics: (1) identification of critical mission phase(s) and tasks, (2) the elements of the display, (3) the display content, (4) the display format, (5) the symboloby, and (6) cost/feasibility assessment of most promising HUD systems. This technical approach employs closed-loop analysis of the pilot's tasks associated with a specific vehicle operational profile or mission phase. The resulting multiloop feedback (and feedforward) structures reveal, in detail, not only the content, format, and dynamic properties of essential pilot information requirements but also appropriate piloting control techniques, which can be helpful in training as well as in predicting flying qualities.",

This problem is important because shrinking budgets drive the ever increasing need for excellent cost-performance ratios in parallel computers. Our proposed solution is to develop a rational parallel computer architecture design technique in which the application is paramount over the architecture and the underlying hardware is based upon commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Our methodology is in two parts. First, we will examine real-time avionics computations for their fundamental computational behaviors. Second, we will develop appropriate modeling tools in which the behavior of the avionics computations drive the parallel computer architecture design. From this Phase I effort, we will produce the high-level design of a COTS-based parallel computer (with an excellent cost-performance ratio) specifically intended to solve real-time avionics computations. The Principal Investigator has performed research in the area of parallel computer architecture, and the Key Personnel have considerable software engineering experience in designing and implementing tools. The long term commercialization result will be a methodology by which to design and build high performance, low cost parallel computers for specific application domains.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         SYTRONICS proposed to investigate ways to decrease the time required to maintain the T038A between training flights. The T-38A still fills the Air Forces's Bomber Fighter training needs, and system upgrades being completed under Northrop's PACER CLASSIC Program help keep the aircraft technologically up-to-date. SYTRONICS' maintenance study can ensure that the T-38A will serve as an efficient, reliable trainer into the 21st century and beyond. The key to SYTRONICS' effort is the data provided by Northrop's Supportability Technology Development Center. Northrop built the T-38 and has collected large amounts of data (ranging from 1972 data to current, real-time CAMS data) on all aspects of T-38 maintenance. In addition to Northrop's recorded data, SYTRONICS will also be able to call on Northrop personnel who maintained the T-38 while serving in the Air Force. This first-hand experience will be invaluable to SYTRONICS' study. Possible maintenance improvements produced by the Phase I study will become specific recommendations for Air Force action during Phase II. In Phase III, SYTRONICS will develop a procedural prototype for T-38A maintenance.",

The Department of Defense spends an estimated $5 billion per year on training. Simulations can aid training, but there is no reliable method for generating simulation requirement from training objectives, nor are there productive automated aids. Yet people perform the task, some with high degrees of expertise. We propose research to develop a well defined method for performing the task. We also propose to construct a knowledge based system to support portions of the task. In combination, this can be expected to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the training-objective-to-performance-requirement task.",

Both experimental and computational approaches will be undertaken to study the flow swirl effects on combustion for designing more efficient ramrocket combustors. The design of flow swirlers as well as air inlet angles, will be the central parameters for performance testing. The goal is to achieve better fuel/air mixing, less pressure loss, larger net thrust, and more stable flames. Full scale experiments will be tested in the test cell 18, Building 18C, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base under nonreacting and reacting flow conditions. Advanced 3-D computational simulations will be developed as a parallel study with the experiments to provide more economic and efficient guidelines for combustor designs. Liquid fuel atomization and spray combustion are also planned to be studied. The knowledge will be useful for designing injector geometry and its mounting location of liquid fueled ramrockets and other liquid fueled combustors.",

The target for the final product is to reduce the cost to $50. The Phase Iresearch will include the design and prototype of various fiber optic magnifiers, the verification ofmanufacturing methods and an analysis of the performance cost trade-offs. Phase II will produce aseries of tapered fiber optic reading magnifiers, and test their performance acceptance with low-visionpatients.",

There will also be few trainers, training developers, and smaller support staff for production of training materials. In addition, training production costs are rising. The Crew size reductions in Army weapons systems have been made possible by Intelligent functions such as Decision Support Systems/Decision Aids which perform operations normally associated with crew members. These cooperative, computer-based systems will require a different level of training than was previously provided. Decision Support Systems are now being developed for armor and artillery, and these systems will require Embedded Training for all crew members. U.S. Army TACOM has developed a Vetronics Crew Display Demonstrator (VCDD) for development and evaluation of concepts relating to future vehicle-based weapons systems requirements. A major focus of this effort are the requirements for the Integrated Two-man Crew Station (ITCS). The ITCS architecture will integrate the physical, electronic, intelligent subsystems, training and control functions into a fieldable configuration. The effort proposed here is directed at the Embedded Training component .",

The first is to investigate the feasibility ofimplementing certain critical areas of the hardware of an ultrasound scanner, which was developed foruse with inverse scattering theory, as VLSI components. The second is to develop calibrationmechanisms for ultrasound inverse scattering tomography of the female breast. Both of these objectiveswill accelerate the process of moving our inverse scattering imaging algorithms, now operating on slowermechanical laboratory scanners, onto an electronic scanning platform that is more suitable for the clinicalenvironment. These objectives shall be accomplished by upgrading an existing prototype ultrasoundscanner which was initially developed to aid our research into inverse scattering tomography as appliedto breast cancer imaging. This scanner, the TechniScan Ultrasound Breast Scanner (TUBS), has suppliedTechniScan with a deeper understanding of some of the technological difficulties which need to beovercome for inverse scattering to work in a clinical environment. In order for TechniScan to proceedwith this development, we believe that it is necessary to retrofit the TUBS with state-of-the-arttechnology. This shall include addition of a higher resolution analog-to-digital converter and atemperature monitor.",

A solid polymer electrolyte for lithium batteries will allow placement of the electrodes in close proximity, bipolar cell constrution, and retardation of undesirable chemical reactions to meet US Army requirements for the secondary Li batteries which can potentially deliver an energy density of 200 Wh/kg and a power density of 40 W/kg. This R&D; program focuses on the synthesis of novel organic salts, and polymer electrolytes based on these salts to achieve a structure of improved Li+ ion conductivity. Such a polymeric separator is expected to be stable in the chosen Li/MnO2 cell chemistry. The program objectives also include developing Li-intercalation cathodes and testing these components in a flat configuration to demonstrate the feasibility of a high energy density, compact yet safe, secondary lithium battery to meet the space mission requirements. The Phase I program will concentrate upon the development of a nevel stable solid polymer electrolyte, which is a host structure to a high conductivity medium for Li+ ions and to demonstrate the feasibility of improved Li/MnO2 cells using these polymer electrolytes. The Phase II efforts will be devoted to the development of Li-insertion anodes, high voltage cathodes, design, fabrication, and testing of battery prototypes which will utilize the new high conductivity polymer electrolytes for mission-specific US Army applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Solid state active phased array antennas promise to provide very low sidelobe capability. However, they will be subject to short term calibration drift and element failures. This compels an on-line, operational self calibration capability. TSC proposes a completely internal, on-line self calibration technique which utilizes the inherent mutual coupling among the radiating elements to accurately measure the transfer coefficients of each of the elements and their associated T/R module receivers and transmitters, transmission lines, and beamformers. The technique does not require knowledge of the absolute magnitude of the mutual coupling coefficients, but exploits the fact that the coupling coefficients will be very consistent across the array, and will remain very stable with time. Once the transfer coefficients are accurately measured, the appropriate corrections are applied to the T/R module phase shifters and attenuators. In case of a failed element, one of several algorithms is applied which optimally adjusts the other elements in the array to recover the antenna pattern sidelobe performance. The simplest of these to implement utilizes adjustments to the weights of the other elements in the array to synthesize, and add back, a close approximation of the missing array element pattern.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A ground-based clutter emulation transponder is proposed for the cost-effective development and testing of airborne space-time adaptive processing (STAP) algorithms. The deisgn of the clutter emulator is based on uniquely modulating each output of a radar transponder having multiple transmit antennas that are spatially distributed in the cross-range dimension. During Phase I, the feasibility of using the ground-based transponder to emulate accurately the spatial and temporal characteristics of sidelobe clutter, as observed by an airborne radar, will be analyzed. The quality of the emulation will be determined by simulating the responses of selected STAP algorithms to a computer model of the transponder. The responses will be compared to the outputs that are obtained when the algorithms are exercised using existing, high-fidelity clutter simulations. For the design configurations that yield favorable comparisons, the simulation will be used to quantify the cirtical emulator parameters and thereby establish the feasibility of the concept. Both an implementation plan for the clutter emulator, and a demonstration test plan based on using the UHF RSTER system will be prepared to facilitate the transition into Phase II of the SBIR Program. Anticipated Benefits: The principal benefit of the proposed concept is the acceleration of the development of a critical enabling technology during a period of reduced defense spending. This benefit can be realized because the clutter emulator will allow existing ground-based assets, rather than costly-to-operate airborne assets, to be used during the initial stages of STAP algorithm development. The clutter transponder could be applied to the testing of systems such as air traffic control radars.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Nap-of-the-Earth (NOE) flight in a conventional helicopter is extremely taxing for two pilots under visual flight rules (VFR) conditions. There is a desire to develop an all-weather Automated NOE (ANOE) system that will allow a single pilot to safely fly a helicopter at altitudes near 50 feet. Recent work by NASA/ARC has indicated that ranging to the ground and potential hazards using passive camera sensors can significantly improve ANOE performance. These sensors indicate that an effective all-weather, day/night, ANOE system can be developed by augmenting passive sensors, INS/GPS and hazard data with an active radar system. At present, the data base required to specify such a sensor system does not exist. This proposal is to define a low cost, data collection radar to derive the necessary data base. During Phase II the radar would be developed and tested. This radar will collect data not only for the ANOE mission but will also collect data to determine its utility as a situational awareness sensor during approach, landing and taxiing. In addition, the radar will collect preliminary data to help define a machine vision system for landing in very low visibility. The critical issues are height measurement accuracy and hazard detection, e.g., towers and wires. We will use our experience in developing unique algorithms for obtaining very precise height accuracy. We will use elevation and azimuth monopulse diversity to detect and measure hazardous obstacles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The proposed program will develop automatic geologic and terrain feature classification algorithms, emphasizing those that exploit the additional height and terrain slope information provided by IFSAR imagery. To accomplish this, existing 3 m resolution 1FSAR imagery will be used to identify critical feature components, and to develop and exercise scene segmentation and terrain identification algorithms. The program will quantify the advantages that such 3-D processing can achieve relative to conventional, 2-D SAR systems. Two-aperture IFSAR data are subject to glint effects that can seriously degrade height estimation accuracy. Utilizing three vertical subapertures provides two IFSAR images simultaneously. A unique algorithm can then be applied to determine the height of both a primary and a possible secondary scatterer. Available, three-subaperture, 10 m resolution IFSAR imagery, which has been collected and is currently being processed under an IR&D; program, will be utilized during Phase I to quantify the benefits 0-f three-subaperture operation. ATR and pattern recognition techniques, developed on programs for radar target classification, will be adapted to scene classification. Existing software will be used to perform SAR data retrieval and image processing, and to exploit USGS data bases in ground-truth assessment. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Automatic geologic and terrain classification from SAR and IFSAR data has numerous applications. Commercial and scientific applications include such diverse possibilities as providing accurate data bases for siting portable air traffic control radars during emergency efforts (e.g. after hurricanes and floods), detecting terrain features indicating the presence of minerals or oil, and monitoring the size and health of forests and wetlands. Military applications include identification of potential targets in deep-hide areas. and automatic navigation using terrain features.",

The most current techniques for video data compression will be necessary and include two-dimensional intra-frame image compression as well as inter-frame redundancy reduction. A successful result will have many biomedical applications, both research related and clinical. This project will focus on its application to clinical video/EEG monitoring for epilepsy. Direct video/EEG recording to computer disk could replace video tape recording presently used clinically in hundreds of epilepsy centers. Significant time saving to find, analyze, and annotate seizures on video tape would result. Increased precision in correlating behavioral and physiologic data as well as a vast improvement in convenient archiving and networking video/EEG data files would also result.",

However, conventional file transfer systems (which convert or prepare application users' multimedia information into streams of bitsto be transferred to physical networks, or vice versa) such as TCP/IP are far from sufficient in supporting the multimedia applications, and tend to become major performance bottlenecks for distributed multimedia applications. In the proposed Phase I work, a multimedia file transfer system will be developed for heterogeneous distributed networking enviornments, which automatically characterizes the service requirements for multimedia applications and extracts the needed engineering parameters (such as jitter, throughput, error rate, delay, etc.) to optimally drive or control the lower level physical networks. Moreover, the proposed system, which is independent of the underlying network architecture, will optimally plan and control the communications by taking into account the effect of underlying network architectures and traffic conditions.",

The airplane will utilize cost and weight effective composite structures designed for progressive failure to absorb energy. In addition the forward portions of the airplane will be designed to reduce the tendency of digging into soft soil by a combination of shape and strength of the lower cowl. Careful shaping of rate sensitive foam seat cushions will protect various size and weight occupants from impact decelerations. Completion of Phase I will provide the data necessary for completion of the structural design and completion of Phase II will verify the complete design process through subscale tests. Tooling will be built and a number of airframes provided to NASA for full scale tests (once tooling is built the cost of test airframes will be relatively low). Tests completed under this program will extend NASA data into complete airframes and the low cost airframes will allow NASA the opportunity to extend their full scale crash data base into small composite airplanes and to further explore impacts into soil.",

In the last few years, there has been a considerable effort to apply artificial neural networks to different fields of manufacturing due to its favorable features like parallelism, robustness and compactness. Research issuesto be explored include: 1) The ability of ANN's to learn and predict geometric and thermal errors from training data of the tool point error vectors, cutting tool location and strategically located temperature probes; 2) identification of appropriate inputs and outputs for ANN prediction of tool wear, elastic deflections and contouring errors; and 3) interface of trained ANN to provide inputs to a real-time error compensation system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal discusses the need for a monitor on commercial aircraft capable of detecting RF emissions over a broad dynamic range and an extremely wide electromagnetic spectrum. The security monitor has two purposes: (1) detect inadvertent RF emissions from passenger's portable electronic devices (PEDs) and (2)detect attacks from hostile subversives using high power microwave (HPM) RF weapons. The proposal discusses the synergistic combination of airline's advertisement of their vulnerability to hostile sources, the increased incididence and probability of domestic terrorist activity, the availability of HPM sources and their intrinsic characteristics that make them particularly attractive to subversives. A possible attack scenario is described in terms of the immediate results and the evidence that would be left for investigators. The consequences of ignoring the present vulverability are explored, as well as the safety net provided by deployment of sensor systems. To optimize the value of the sensor system, it's usefulness in detecting non-hostie, inadvertent emissions from passenger's PEDs is also defined. Having such a system deployed in commercial aircraft will simultaneously allow passengers to operate non-interfering electronic systems freely while preventing and locating PEDs that are radiating interference.",

IMPROVED HYDRIDE HEAT EXCHANGERS ARE NEEDED THAT HAVE MORE RAPID HEAT TRANSFER AND HYDROGEN FLOW.  HYDRIDES HAVE LOW THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY SO THAT RAPID HEAT TRANSFER INTO AND OUT OF THE HYDRIDE BED IS DIFFICULT.

It is expressed as a form of discrete threshold logic entirely in terms of \"M of N\" threshold gates and is comparable in terms of transistor count to functionally equivalent Boolean circuits. Clocks require a significant investment in design, fabrication and life cycle costs. All design & manufacturing issues and all failure modes due to timing problems are eliminated with NULL Convention Logic.

This will involve coupling all candidate fluorophores to primers and testing for emission sensitivity, DNA synthesis efficiency and instrument compatibility. In phase two we will develop and commercialize an instrument capable of sequencing up to 26,000 bases/hour. This will be accomplished in collaboration with 8,000 bases/hour automated DNA sequencer.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Top-Vu's unique approach is to integrate micro-inertial elements and electronics on a gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate. The advantages are high precision guidance and navigation, virtually no uncorrelated output errors, high reliability in accelerated environment, excellent electrical isolation with mechanical switch, extremely wide operating temperature range (both high and low), excellent radiation hardness, high speed response (real time), high sensor coupling efficiency with GaAs electronics, photonic integration and interface, and low noise. Our strategy addresses the performance improvements by combining the material, device, circuit, and system technologies together. Our approach is innovative, effective, and provides system capabilities unobtainable without the use of GaAs technology. The objective of this project is to develop monolithic GaAas-based accelerometers with GaAs readout electronics. The technical objectives of the Phase I 6 months project are to: 1) design optimization of micro-inertial elements (accelerometers and microactuator switches), 2) process integration, and 3) readout electronics. The primary application of this project is for integrated guidance and navigation subsystems, and it is applicable to man other micro-electro-mechanical systems for defense applications such as intertial measurment units, body-position sensors, electromechanical signal processing elements and opto-mechanical systems.",

Total cost of such worldwide monitoring is minimized, subject to operational utility constraints, by: (i.) exploiting the minimum per bit transmission cost achieved by low earth orbit satellites supported by a network of gateways, (ii.) minimization of the number of bits transmitted through efficient source compression, (iii.) effective acknowledgement / re-transmission protocal overlaid on the link transmission protocal for messages requiring assured delivery, and (iv.) very low cost innovative terminal equipment capable of reliable unattended operation. The basic terminal, in a different physical package, can be interconnected to a laptop or palmtop computer to provide a battery-powered transportable communications capability for inspection teams anywhere on earth. The RANCON system also offers the opportunity to bypass local communications facilities for the global nuclear proliferation moni'tori,ng system, should such a feature be deemed operational. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Upon completion of a successful Phase II demonstration in 1995, the RANCON could be fielded immediately in support of the global nuclear proliferation monitoring system. The RANCON technology could be applied by the government to a wide variety of operations that would benefit from flexible, low cost data exchange via satellite, such as traffic monitoring, long range logistics support and environmental data collection. Commercial applications include two-way communication for casr accident reporting, animal tracking, etc.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Under sponsorship of the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC/XR), Toyon Research Corporation developed an innovative approah for simulating the interaction of an aircraft employing radar countermeasures against an attacking missile employing counter-countermeasures. The Toyon approach yields a simulation which is very fast running, yet models all principal factors, including those which are computationally demanding. It has been implemented under a Microsoft Windows environment using standard pull-down menus familar to PC users. This proposal is to initiate an effort to extend Toyon's innovative radar-guided missile simulation to include optically guided missiles. The integrated simulation will provide ASC and other users with the ability to (1) rapidly derive a quantitative understanding of target/missile engagements, (2) explore tradeoffs of the key parameters for the purpose of developing better radar and optical countermeasures and counter-countermeasures, and (3) efficiently train new personnel in the science of target/missile countermeasures. In order to prove both the feasibility and value of the proposed simulation, Toyon will deliver a computer disk containing executable code which demonstrates a sequence of interesting target/missile engagements employing optical seekers.",

The filtration system must be simple, lightweight, and produce negligible pressure drops across the air intake. The filter will be fabricated by sol-gel techniques using a patent pending ambient pressure drying procedure that offers net-shape, low-cost fabrication with precise control of membrane pore structure. Combined with ceramic fiber reinforcement, the sol-gel process enables the fabrication of tough, low cost, high performance filters. Cylindrical filters will be chemically aged, dried, and infiltrated to control membrane pore size and pore size distribution. A hydrophobic layer will be covalently bound to the surface of the filter to prevent airborne contaminants from wetting and fouling the filter. Characterization will include thermal stability, mechanical properties, pore size and pore size distribution, filtration efficiency, in-line pressure drop, and wetting. TPL, supported by the research studies of the Center for Micro-Engineered Ceramics at the University of New Mexico, represents state-of-the-art expertise in ceramics, composites, sol-gel processing, and filter technology.",

These advances are both in the equipment and signal processing algorithm areas. Miniaturized microphones and audio transducers with excellent frequency response have provided the basis for improved electronic signal processing. Small, low power consumption digital signal processors make feasible implementation of powerful adaptive signal processing algorithms in very small form factor devices. These algorithms provide the means to attenuate background noise, widen the dynamic range of human hearing, and improve sound location capabilities. A Phase I program is proposed that will use a digital signal processing system consisting of non-linear gain, adaptive echo cancellation, and adaptive noise cancellation algorithms to solve hearing enhancement problems. Once a digital solution is achieved the addition of auxiliary capabilities, such as ultrasonic interpersonal communications and electronic sound location indicators (passive sonar-like devices) for night and underwater use, become possible.",

AN EXTENSION OF THAT ISSUE IS THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE INTERMODAL FACILITY AND THE TRAFFIC WHICH COMES AND GOES.

Magnetic bearings require auxiliary ball and roller bearings to carry high transient maneuver loads thta exceed the magnetic bearing capacity and to support the rotor when the magnetic bearings fail or are turned off. Commercial hybrid-ceramic auxiliary ball bearings have performed best but have failed at high-speed touch-downs in recent magnetic bearing rotor testing. Special solid-lubricated self-contained ceramic bearings patented by Tribology Systems, Inc. (TSI), have already achieved considerable analysis and test experience under operating conditions very similar to that whihc auxiliary magnetic back-up bearings are subjected to, including rapid acceleration to high speeds and successful long-life operation under high transient shock loads. TSI was selected competitively to suppoy auxiliary bearing analysis and prototypes for United Technologies' magnetic bearing rotor testing this year. Starting with the above analysis and test experience, auxiliary ball and roller bearings for Army magnetic bearing gas-turbine engines will be analyzed with TSI's advanced bearing computer codes in coordination with the latest rotor dynamics and magnetic bearing control technology on Phase I. The resulting most promising bearing configurations will be made and tested at an engine manufacturer in Phase II.",

The principal objective of the system development process is to establish a design which satisfies the system requirements and constraints while optimizing the key trade-offs and issues associated with system functionality, behavior, and implementation. This Phase I SBIR project will leverage ongoing research to refine a multi-domain system design capture and analysis methodology based upon five views of the system and will develop an advanced tool prototype supporting this methodology. The tool will allow the user to rapidly capture the system design across the five design views using an interactive graphic user interface and provide automated support for consistency checking and for defining the mappings or relationships between views. Interfaces to existing tools such as Teamwork by Cadre and others will be supported through adherence to the CASE Data Interchange Format (CDIF) for import and export of captured design data. The tool will also support automated conversion or generation of executable simulations from the captured design.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Auxiliary Power Unit of military and commercial aircraft use permanent magnet generator to provide electrical power for key systems such as a full authority digital electronic control (FADEC) system and vital sensor systems. The rotor of this generator is made of samarium-cobalt magnets and generates core heating due to eddy and hysterisis losses. Cooling of the rotor to a safe operating temperature is essential to maintain the required efficiency. Conventional forced air or oil jet cooling of the hollow rotor shaft has been found to yield poor results. This proposal addresses a novel cooling concept to efficiently cool the rotor. The rotating heat pipe principle is used here. A set of radial fin-like vapor chambers attached to an external condenser through the extended hollow shaft. The condenser can be conveniently cooled by liquid spray cooling externally. As an operating temperature < 200oC is preferred for the generators, water or alcohol can be used as working fluid. The objectives of Phase I effort are to design a representative APU rotor thermal model and analyze its thermal characteristics incorporating the proposed cooling technique for demonstrating the feasibility. Anticipated Benefits: Efficient cooling of generator rotor prevents machine overheating and premature failures. APUs can be built very reliably, minimizing aircraft engine repair or down time. A well-cooled rotor design will result in weight reduction. Potential commercial applications include ground carts, portable generators, environmental control equipment and motors for electric transportation vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Attenuation correction in positron emission tomography (PET) is usually achieved using a transmission scan, which is typically performed with one or several rotating rod sources containing a positron emitter such as Ge-68. Since good statistics is required in the transmission scan, the imaging time is typically 10 to 20 minutes and the activity in the rod sources is as high as the scanner countrate capability permits. We will perform the transmission scan with singles gamma-ray emitter with an energy which is somewhat higher than 511 keV; therefore, the energy discrimination can be used to separate its energy from that of a positron emitter. This transmission source is shielded towards the nearer detector; this allows higher levels of activity to be used with the aim of reducing the total transmission time while still obtaining adequate statistical accuracy.",

MATERIALS THAT WOULD PERMIT A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OPERATING TEMPERATURE WOULD ALLOW INCREASED PERFORMANCE, DECREASED WEIGHT, AND A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE SYSTEM IMPACT FOR A VARIETY OF STRATEGIC DEFENSE APPLICATIONS. HAFNIUM CARBIDE (HfC), TANTALUM CARBIDE (TaC), AND THEIR ALLOYS, WHICH ARE THE MOST THERMODYNAMICALLY STABLE COMPOUNDS KNOWN AND POSSESS THE HIGHEST MELTING POINTS OF ANY KNOWN MATERIALS SYSTEM, SHOW GOOD POTENTIAL FOR THIS APPLICATION. BECAUSE OF THEIR LOW STRAIN TO FAILURE AND POOR THERMAL SHOCK RESISTANCE, HOWEVER, FABRICATION METHODS AND MICROSTRUCTURAL DESIGNS MUST BE DEVELOPED TO IMPROVE THE TOUGHNESS OF THESE MATERIALS FOR FOR THEM TO BECOME VIABLE FOR ENGINE APPLICATION. IN THIS PHASE I PROGRAM, ULTRAMET PROPOSES TO DEMONTRATE THE FABRICATION OF THESE ULTRAHIGH-TEMPERATURE MATERIALS AND CONDUCT MODELING AND LABORATORY ANALYSIS IN SIMULATED LIQUID ROCKET MOTOR ENVIRONMENTS. ULTRAMET WILL SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATE THE FABRICATION, DESIGN, AND PERFORMANCE OF CARBON FIBER-REINFORCED HfC/TaC COMPOSITES, LEADING TO DRAMATIC PERFORMANCE GAINS IN LIQUID ROCKET MOTORS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH WILL BE ONCORPORATED INTO THE NEXT GENERATION OF COMMERCIAL SATELLITE PROPULSION SYSTEMS.",

A major problem with such systems is that the barrel must be replaced far too often due to excessive wear and corrosion at the breech end, which limits weapons system accuracy adn dramatically accelerates with extended high-rate-of-fire bursts and/or higher energy propellants. In this Phase I program, Ultramet proposes a baseline sloution to this generic problem through the use of rhenuim inserts. Refractory metals and alloys and fabrication process eill be evaluated for cost, performance, and compatibility improvements over the baseline rhenium and tantalum/tungsten (Ta-10W) alloys. A rhenium insert will be fabricated for actual gun performance validation to provide a baseline high coatings will be fabricated and subjected to wear and erosion testing using verified methods for comparison to current stellite and chrome-plated steel barrels and the baseline rhenium and Ta-10W materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Noise generated by general aviation aircraft has a negative impact on the aviation community, and strict adherence to FAR Part 36 regulations requires noise reductions on the majority of these aircraft. Any new aircraft certified or any modification to an existing aircraft must show compliance with this regulation. The majority of these aircraft are owned by individuals and are used for recreational flying. Community airport noise standards are increasingly more strict as suburban areas spread toward small airports. The majority of noise in these airplanes, which use reciprocating engines, is derived from the engine and exhaust, and can be reduced or eliminated through the use of a properly designed exhaust/muffler system. In this Phase I program, Ultramet proposes to develop the design methodology and system characterization for add-on muffler systems requiring only slight modification to the exhaust system. A durable, high-temperature ceramic foam bulk adsorber/baffle material will be used to create 20-25 dB engine noise reduction at design exhaust system backpressures of less than 2\" of mercury. The proposed program will include acoustic characterization of various high-temperature baffle/adsorber materials, providing a design methodology for a given airplane engine noise frequency spectrum and sound pressure level. Additionally, the design procedures and materials data will be verified by constructing and beginning FAR qualification of a quiet muffler system for a general aviation aircraft.",

The project will be combined with software that will permit easy access to the coding, universe information, and questionnaire context of all variables. The foundations for this project are three computer utilities that have already been completed; however, the utilities are for a UNIX mainframe environment. One utility searches through a dictionary of CPS variable names to find all variable names that contain any user-supplied character string. The second utility takes a list of variable names supplied by the user and produces an ASCII file of the CPS data for the appropriate survey years. This utility also issues a report on the screen (or other medium) containing the coding and universe information for each variable in all survey years. The third utility provides context by outputting (to the medium designated by the user) a list of the CPS questions that gave rise to the variables supplied by the user. Proposed Phase I funding will be used to improve and complete existing documentation, to write a user's manual, to modify and improve the existing utilities, and to develop compression/decompression algorithms appropriate for storing the CPS data on CD.",

The software developed as part of the project will allow demographers, sociologist, economists, epidemiologist, and researchers in other fields to answer a greatly expanded set of analytical questions not previously possible. Statistical procedures included in the software will be useful for modeling marital and nonmarital fertility, adult and child morality, cohabitation, marriage, divorce, health care utilization, medical cost, nursing home use, and a wide variety of other demographic models. Statistical models include failure-time, qualitative outcome, and continuous panel data. An important new feature is the ability to model these processes jointly. The project will take recent statistical developments previously applied to specific research problems and (1) develop the basic set of algorithms into a flexible and powerful software package, (2) make the software user friendly, (3) document the technical statistical algorithms, (4) write reference and user's manuals, (5) plan for distribution of the software, (6) provide training workshops for new users, and (7) design a system of support for users. Phase I will acquire existing algorithms, demonstrate feasibility of the software package, and plan Phase II research.",

This advanced fluid-fluid energy exchange device can serve as the core of high performance gas generators to meet a variety of land/air applications. This unique system is based on unsteady flow phenomena which produces the functional equivalent of a coupled gas turbine and compressor by continous expansion of one gas stream while extracting energy which is used to compress another gas stream. The wave processes occur within one rotor which features canted blades that are alternately exposed to hot and cold fluids resulting in material temperatures much lower than peak cycle values. The proposed program features the modification of an existing CFD code, that has been developed to investigate the wave processes within a rotor cell, to include blade angel and cell area change effects, and exercise the code to determine optimum rotor and performance characteristics suitable for laboratory test rig. A unique concept will be difined for a cold flow laboratory test rig that features flexibililty, modularization, ability to acommodate test diagnostics, and be economical. Moreover, the design will allow for first and second stages of the expansion/compression processes to be investigated without need for high temperature combustor gases.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The treatment and disinfection of water for drinking continues to be a major public health issue.  It is clear that disinfection methods involving chlorine compounds result in the formation of byproducts that constitute a health risk.  The proposed work addresses the removal of the disinfection byproducts (DBPs), especially the haloacetic acids, or their humate and fulvate precursors by using an inexpensive inorganic material as a catalytic or anion exchange material, respectively.  The Phase I work demonstrated that one of the ion exchange materials can effect nearly complete removal of the precursor humic substances present in the water.  These materials can also catalyze the decomposition of the haloacetic acids at ambient conditions.  The goal of the Phase II work is to develop a viable technology for water treatment that either (1) removes the DBP precursor so that low levels of DBPs are obtained with disinfection one or (2) removes the haloacetic acids from the chlorinated water.  Sufficient data is needed to reach a go/no go decision that either process is competitive with activated carbon and membrane filtation and proceeding with either process to the pilot stage is a convincing investment.",

Phase I will culminate in a laboratory demonstration of the core process technology, using readily available materials and apparatus. A thermocouple and connecting leads will be produced on a prepared turbine blade surface, and the maximum use temperature of the thermocouple will be measured. The demonstration will show that the full process will be capable of producing individual thermocouples, strain gages and heat flux sensors and arrays of these sensors on any part of the surface of the turbine blade, and that these sensors will survive turbine operating temperatures. In a Phase II continuation, the full process weill be designed and constructed. Individual heat flux sensors, thermocouples and strain gages, together with their interconnections, will be produced on prepared turbine blade surfaces. The resulting test articles will be tested by a major gas turbine manufacturer to measure their maximum use temperature.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         1Advanced guns for future Naval systems such as Phalanx will incorporate innovative high-performance chemical and electrical propulsion concepts such as cased telescoped ammunition (CTA) and electro-thermal chemical (ETC) guns to achieve high ballistic performance. The combination of high performance, high firing rate (over 1000 rounds per minute per barrel), and extensive burst fire duration imposes extreme heating loads on the barrels that cannot be withstood by conventional barrel design techniques. In recent years, new materials, coating, platings, and manufacturing techniques have been developed that may be successfully applied to high-performance gun barrel design. High melting temperature yet resilient ceramics, coating and sputtering techniques for applying high temperature materials, and new metals and compound design techniques incorporating liners, etc., are conceptually promising but need to undergo design and evaluation. During the proposed program, candidate meterials and processes for advanced gun barrel design will be identified and evaluated. The Phase I effort will include interior ballistic simulations to help define the themal and pressure environment; formulation of innovative barrel design concepts that take advantage of material properties; structural design analyses to evaluate material configurations in the ballistic environment; and heat conduction simulations to evaluate thermal response and behavior under burst-fire conditions. It is anticipated that one or more advanced barrel design configurations will be shown to be feasible and suitable for experimental development and evaluation during Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Planned next-generation ejection seats address the need for expanded egress envelopes, in part, through the addition of active attitude con propulstio systems. Such systems are complex and add significant weight to the seat. One of the factors driving this complexity is low (or negated static stability. Increased static stability early in the egress period could reduce the size and complexity required of the active attitude controls. At high airspeeds a small lifting surface can generate high maneuvering forces that can further help to expand the safe egress envelope. The proposed research will determine feasiblity and produce preliminary designs for two deployable aerodynamic devices. One is a stabilizer consisting of cruciform fins on the ends of rapid-deployment booms. The device will provide increased static stability within 100 msec of first motion. The second device is a pair of small wings that deploy from the sides of the seat and provide lift for hard upward maneuvering.",

In initial studies, it retains cytotoxic activity against cancer cells in culture and yet elicits none of the toxic effects associated with TNF in healthy mice. These studies will be continued and expanded. The goal is to establish the in vivo efficacy of the formulation as a cancer treatment. To this end, liposomal TNF will be produced in sufficient quantity to define (1) its cytotoxic activity against murine B16 melanoma cells, (2) its lethal dose in B57CI/6 mice that bear B16 melanoma implants, and (3) its in vivo effectiveness as a treatment for murine melanoma. Formulations containing murine and human TNF-alpha will be compared because cross-species variation in TNF-receptor interactions are known. Identically prepared liposomes without TNF-alpha will serve as a control. In light of the tremendous effort that has gone into trying to extend TNF's very narrow therapeutic index, production of an active, clinically acceptable form of TNF would prove to be a major milestone.",

A recently developed ZVS PWM forward converter with an active clamp combines the soft switching advantages of a resonant converter with the low voltage and current stress of a PWM converter. The converter also allows self-driven synchronous rectifiers. Obtaining the necessary power density and efficiency will also require an advanced magnetics design with possibly PCB or printed windings. Internal wiring must held to a minimum with transistor and diode dies are mounded directly on the transformer windings. The problem cannot be solved without advanced computer-aided design tools such as finite-element analysis and thermal analysis software. The goal is to achieve a power density of 100W/in(cubed) and an efficiency of 90%.",

To date, there are only two FDA approved drugs which provide direct antiviral activity against this virus, and the toxicities and emerging resistance limit their widespread utility. In order for new and efficacious anti-HIV agent to enter human clinical trials, small animal models are required to demonstrate in vivo activity. Since HIV is a uniquely human virus, novel means are required to introduce this virus into rodent hosts. One such means is through the xenotransplantation of human HIV permissive cells into sublethally irradiated athymic mice. We have previously demonstrated that the CEM cell line infected with the III-B strain of the HIV can reproducibly demonstrate high levels of p24 antigenemia using this novel approach. With anticipation of expanding this model into a fully accepted and valid small animal model of HIV infection for efficacy evaluation of pharmaceutical compounds, it is the overall objective to continue to refine this model. This will be accomplished by expanding the transplantation aspect to include HIV permissive cells of various phenotypes, by expanding the HIV strains (including AZT resistant & primary) capable of replication within this system, and by introducing other well established means of measuring viral infectivity (i. e., FACS analysis). This additional information will provide a firm basis to design the experiments required for drug therapy determinations in this animal model system.",

Surveys of DoD and civilian researchers will determine features and performance goals for the system. Surveys of IRFPA manufacturers will ensure that the system will operate with all next generation IRFPA's. Additional system objectives are compact size, moderate cost, and ease of use. The system will be configured for different IRFPA's with software, and will not require hardware or wiring changes when changing IRFPA's. Key areas of development will include high speed IRFPA drive electronics and preamplifiers, very fast high resolution multichannel data acquisition, signal processors for data reduction, and optical fiber data interfaces. Breadboard experiments will verify the technical feasbility of the performance objectives. Successful completion of this work will lead directly to the construction and evaluation of a complete system in the Phase II program.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Breast cancer mortality will be drastically reduced if tumors are diagnosed and removed as early as possible before the onset of metastasis. On the basis of data from the groups working with contract-enhanced MRM, it can be expected that MRM will in the next century replace conventional mammography as the chosen procedure for breast imaging. Since the current MRM is more expensive than conventional mammography, its increased application will accelerate if a special inexpensive MRM devices appear on the market. A low cost, open air, self-shielded superconducting MRM has been designed and proposed. The MRM will enable the patient to be examined in the open air with surface coils very accessible for breast biopsy. The patient can be maneuvered around, so the magnet only needs to produce a smaller volume of high resolution magnetic field. Therefore, the overall physical size and the cost of the MRM will be significantly reduced. Since the MRM is self-shielded, the cost of any facility construction, remodeling or shielding will be eliminated. We will (1) design \"C\" shaped split gap 1.0 T self shielded superconducting MRM and (2) design a table top 0.5 T or vertical superconducting wall permanent magnets composed of high temperature superconductors. These designs will have sufficient details to allow the selection of construction of a low cost MRM in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Bubbles within a cloud can undergo collective oscillations and produce large acoustic emissions at low frequencies (20 to 2 kHz). Using the collective oscillation properties, relatively small targets can be developed for underwater acoustics research and other applications. This proposal presents three designs to produce and contain bubble clouds in a fixed geometry for the purpose of producing low-cost, high-target-strength acoustic scatterers for sonar calibration and decoy design. THe first design is a cylindrical container made of an acoutstically transparent material. A propeller will be used to disperse the bubble sinto a spatially homogeneous distribution. Compressed air or chemical foaming agents can be used as the air supply to produce microbubbles from an underwater bubbler. The second design uses agar gel to stabilize air bubbles grown from decompression of the supersaturated gel. The third design uses polymer additives to suspend and stabilize bubbles injected at the time of target production. The void fraction and bubble size can be adjusted by mass flow rate, size of aerator and degree of supersaturation, depending on the design selected. The acoustic resonance frequency can be tuned by varying the size and number of the injected bubbles (therefore, the void fraction) and the size of the containers. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: This research effort will lead to the successful development of low-cost bubble cloud targets for commercial applications in sonar calibration, undersea beaconing, environmental simulation, and designs of decoys and countermeasures. The products will benefit researchers as well as manufacturers in the field of ocean acoustics and defense industries conducting underwater acoustics research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         QUEST Integrated, Inc. (formerly Flow Research) proposes to develop and fabricate compliant coatings synthesizing dolphin skin/blubber for use on underwater vehicles to achieve drag and flow noise reduction. Guided by the theory of the hydrodynamic response of viscoelastic materials, the design of the compliant coatings will be aided by using a computer code combining finite element techniques, viscoelastic material theory, and available acoustic data from studies on live dolphins. Following the current trend of compliant coating research, we will conisder three different coatings all with a thin but strong exterior layer that serves as the protective skin for the interior layers, which have the desired viscoelastic properties but are weak in mechanical strength against wear and tear. Three types of interior layer(s) will be evaluated: an isotropic layer, multiple (progressively softer) isotropic layers, and multiple fiber-reinforced layers. These compliant coatings will be fabricated, and their viscoelastic properties will be measured at the material laboratory of the Naval Surface Weapons Center. One of the coatings will be selected to be installed on a \"self-propelled\" slender body for laboratory testing in a towing tank as a means for assessing the practicality and robustness of the coating. A novel visualization technique will be used to determine the potential of the coating for drag reduction. For measuring the flow noise, a microphone will be intalled inside the body. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: This development will improve the performance of underwater and surface vehicles, for military and civilian applications; lead to increases in the speed and range of the vehicles, enhancing their mobility and reducing their vulnerability and operational cost; and result in flow noise reduction, and thus decreased detectability. The coatings may also be applied to propellers/impellers to increase thrust output. Commercial applications include use as coatings on ship hulls and as liners in various pipelines.",

A standard set of on-board processing routines will be developed and made available for use during the encoder configuration process. The configurator will be presented graphically with a set of available inputs and preprocessing modules based on the hardware configuration. The configurator will then enter the constraints of the system, such as the bit rate, and will be guided through the configuration process using a graphical format. The end result will be a layout showing the input signals used versus available sample rates, as well as processing modules used and how all of the information fits into the output data block. The package will also use and/or generate the telemetry attributes transfer standard, as defined in IRIG 106-93.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The U.S. Army uses millions of threaded components in its weapon systems, many of which are nonstandard or Class III Safety Critical and therefore must undergo rigorous dimensional quality control. The inspection of threaded parts using conventional surface-contacting gauges is costly, time-consuming, and the results can be subject to operator interpretation. In addition, a special tool is usually required for each thread parameter to be inspected and these tools require periodic certified calibration. The following proposal addresses the need to improve the Army's quality control process by adapting field-proven, laser-based measurement technology to to the application of threaded part inspection. In Phase I a bench-top prototype unit will be designed and built that can be demonstrated on a thread form found on a critical Army ordnance system. During Phase II a full-scale thread inspection system will be developed for use b the Army in one of its ordnance manufacturing plants. The system will be capable of inspecting both external and internal threads and will be adaptable to a large number of parts. The successful completion of this SBIR program will result in significant improvements in the manufacture of threaded parts for the U.S. Army b the implementation of quantitative, noncontact thread measurements and statistical process control.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Novel true-time-delay optical beamforming networks for phased array antennas are devised using nonlinear high efficiency grating technology for free space switches. The switchable gratings are formed using nonlinear volume phase diffraction grating composites. The resulting optical time delay networks include both addressable free space delay lines and uniform delay switching fabrics to route optical channels through desired members of an array of guided wave optical delay devices. An additional nonlinear device is added that selectively absorbs weak signals that leak through nonselected channels due to imperfect diffraction efficiency, scatter, etc. while transmitting the signal in the selected path with minimal attenuation. After refining initial device designs, a computer model of these devices is constructed using volume diffraction and nonlinear optics theory. A prototype network is designed and the model is used to demonstrate feasibility of the concept and design. Experiments are included to study improved material systems. Resulting networks are expected to possess advances in switch isolation (thus lower signal distortion) and insertion loss (yielding greater radar dynamic range). Government markets include radar beamforming networks and private sector opportunities exist for the technology as reconfigurable interconnects.",

HOWEVER, THE COST OF THESE SYSTEMS HAS BEEN WELL OVER $60,000, AND HENCE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS NOT OCCURRED.  THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AN INFRARED SENSOR-BASED SYSTEM FOR WELD PROCESS CONTROL THAT IS NEARLY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE CHEAPER THAN CURRENT SYSTEMS.  THIS COST WOULD PLACE THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WELL WITHIN THE REACH OF PIPELINE, SHIP, AND HEAT TRANSFER PIPING FABRICATORS.  THE LARGE COST REDUCTION IS DUE TO DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW LOW COST INFRARED SENSOR HEAD.  IN PHASE I, PROTOTYPE SENSOR HEADS WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND TESTED TO DEMONSTRATE THE ABILITY OF THE NEW SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY WELD PERTURBATIONS WHICH OCCUR DURING COMMERCIAL, LARGE SCALE WELDING OPERATIONS.  THE ABILITY OF THE INFRARED SENSORS TO IDENTIFY VARYING DEPTHS OF WELD PENETRATION AND WELD MICROSTRUCTURE (MECHANICAL PROPERTIES) WILL BE TESTED.  SENSOR SYSTEM SENSITIVITY, RESPONSE, AND ROBUSTNESS WILL BE EXAMINED TO DETERMINE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE DEVICE TO CONTROLLING THE WELDING PROCESS IN A HARSH WELDING ENVIRONMENT.

The innovative use of single crystal silicon carbide platelets with their highly reflective crystalographic planes, could lead to increased hot wall heat fluxes due to increased reflectivity of the platelets versus the normal particulate. In addition to increased thermal performance, one would anticipate an improvement in the fracture toughness of a platelet reinforced composite over the normal particulate material due to beneficial crack tip deflection. A series of materials and processing techniques will be employed to produce test coupons for mechanical and arc jet testing. Assumming success, a number of devices such as leading edges, injectors, heat exchangers, and sensors could be manufactured under a Phase 2 project.",

This system coordinates written text, image, and geographical documentation on samplecollections with chemical and bioactivity data. Key features of this system include the phylogeneticstructure database engine (PSDE) and geographical information system )GIS). The system supportsportable field units capable of integrating sample collection, chemical, and bioactivity data withphotographic images and regional maps. Phase I will develop and demonstrate as a sample, thesystem's functional aspects using existing collection data, bioactivity data, an academic database, anda commercial chemistry database that can search by compound substructure. Phase II will amplify andextend the PSDE and further refine the system. NAPIS will be marketed to small or large programs withthe ability to customize its features. This powerful information handing concept uses advancedtechnologies to meet the need for source organism dereplication, dereplication by chemotaxonomy,recollection, and expedition planning in murine natural products acquisition programs.",

This will be accomplished through the development of a new deposition process based on sol-gel techniques, which will allow for the deposition of uniform and homogeneous thin films, over large or small surfaces, over flat or odd shaped geometries, with atomically sharp interlayer boundaries, in a low cost process. This is an innovation beyond existing deposition processes which are based on vapor deposition and therefore can not produce atomically sharp boundaries and are difficult to scale up to large odd shaped surfaces. The existing multilayer designs are based on elemental materials of high Z/low Z. We will expand the choice of materials to high Z/low Z compounds. This will allow additional degrees of freedom in optimization of the hard X-Ray optical parameters of choice.",

The camera will be used in the surgical scenario where the patient is injected with a tumor seeking radiopharmaceutical before surgery, the surgical procedure to remove the tumor mass is performed, and the site is then imaged using the IOGC probe to locate residual subclinical tumor cells. The IOGC would be employed for radioisotopes such as 99mTc, 2O1Tl, and 123I which have low energy X- and gamma-rays. The intraoperative gamma-ray camera will use a small and light-weight detachable head comprising a mercuric iodide (HgI2) detector array in order to ensure compact design and high signal-to-noise ratio. During the first phase of the work, a study will be conducted to determine the optimal construction of the detector probe and the resulting design will be incorporated into a small (19 element) prototype array which will be fabricated and evaluated.",

The direct steam water pumping concepts to be considered are a \"chugger\" pump which has been recently studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the condensing ejector pump which as been used in a variety of industrial applications, and the pulse pump which is commonly used in food preparation appliances. All concepts for providing the pumping action are based on the use of atmospheric or low pressure steam as the motive force for pumping and involve simple mechanical arrangements with no moving parts, except for possible check valves. The vest direct two-phase pump type for application to the army requirements will be selected. An overall engineering design will be established and a proof of concept device will be built and tested. The proposed system has a probability of successful development since it is based on the combination of existing burner and two-phase pumping technology.",

This naturally includes computers, which are themselves used in many electrical applicances. To assure quality, circuit cards must be checked for breaks and shorts. We propose five technologies which will allow imaging of electromagnetic fields on a circuit card. These technologies exploit the following physical effects: - electrodynamic forces - electrooptical materials - magnetooptical materials - piezoelectric materials (used for heating, and for deformation) Preliminary numerical estimates for most of the technologies have been carried out. The estimate for using electrodynamic forces appears to allow direct imaging, if tested at a sufficiently low frequency. Two other technologies appear to allow electromagnetic fields to be readily imaged after optical interferometry has been performed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The development of a nitrous oxide/ hydroxl-terminated polybutadiene (N20/HTPB) hybrid rocket motor technology database is proposed. For small rocket systems, N20 based hybrids potentially offer higher performance than liquid oxygen based hybrids for less complexity and cost. Storable and non-cryogenic, N20's advantages stem from its high (750 psia) vapor pressure at room temperature, allowing the oxidizer feed system to operate in a \"blowdown mode\". As such, a pressurization system is not required, increasing stage reliability. As a first step, this investigation is focused on acquiring the data necessary to fully quantify the behavior of N20 at a large scale. Blowdown tests will be conducted for motors in the 10,000 lb thrust class at NASA Stennis Space Center's (SSC) Component Test Facility. SSC will perform the necessary modifications to the CTF for this effort, and will assist in the testing. In addition, design work will be done for both a 10,000 lb and a 40,000 lb thrust N20/HTPB motor, to be tested in the same location in Phase II.",

A primary requirement in the design of read out electronics for MCP FPA applications is the implementation of input circuits which provide the maximum possible well capacity in the space available. Reduction of the noise band width through the use of switched capacitor filtering techniques will be investigated in the design of a circuit with large equivalent well capacity. The completed design will be laid out, fabricated and tested to evaluate performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This is to develop an assay for the identification of fetal blood group antigens using a DNA basedassay method that would allow the use of cells obtained at amniocentesis. The Investigator indicatesapproximately 16% of all multigravida pregnancies in the United States occur in women who are Rhnegative and 84% of the male population is Rh positive, approximately 13% of fetuses are at risk fordevelopment of a hemolytic diseases in the newborn due to Rh incompatibility. Although less than onepercent of fetuses actually develop full blown erythroblastosis fetalis, this outcome is so severe thatserial amniocentesis and percutaneous umbilical blood sampling was adopted for use in all multigravidaRh pregnancies by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. This is required becauseall women at risk, even though approximately 16% of the total women at risk are bearing Rh negativefetuses and thus are at no risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn. In order to achieve the goals ofdesired, the Investigator plans to develop a commercial diagnostic test. His Specific Aims inaccomplishing this goal are (1) to use PCR and DNA sequencing for molecular characterization of multipleRh forms obtained from clinical partners, (2) correlate the DNA sequence information with serologicaldata, (3) development of a DNA heteroduplex screen that will allow rapid identification of multiplealleles,and (4) screening, identification and clinical correlation of Rh isoforms from amniocenteses todemonstrate the utility of the test in predicting hemolytic disease in the newborn. Thus, during PhaseI of this proposal, the Investigator plans to identify the major Rh isoforms and by demonstrating thatDNA based technology can be adapted to amniotic specimens. Subsequently during Phase II, he plansto convert to laboratory procedures for Rh isoforms into a kit format that can be used by any laboratoryperforming PCR amplifications of DNA samples. He recognizes that the specific type of assay procedurefor identifying isoforms will be governed to some extent by the number of alleles that are identifiedduring phase I. If the allele number is large, heteroduplex method will be employed and converted toamplified kit formats for direct analysis on amniotic samples. He indicates that his laboratory hasdemonstrated that mutant alleles from a variety of genetic disorders can be identified in this manner andhas a patent pending on the method of using heteroduplex patterns for identification of specific alleles.He plans to include all the components in kits needed for performance of the tests. This will includesmall precast gels, all necessary primers, buffers, a inexpensive gel apparatus and a visual allele patternrecognition template. If there is a low number of alleles, they plan to adopt an allele specific oligonu-cleotide assay based on a microtiter plate format. This would incorporate fluorescently labeled probes,along with a commercially available microtiter plate reader.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Resting normal cells do not express interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R). The receptor is expressed bysome of the activated cells such as those in certain forms of lymphoid malignancies, autoimmunediseases, and graft rejection. Taking advantage of this property of IL-2R, several IL-2R directed clinicaltrials have been reported with variable successes. For example, IL-2 combined to diphtheria toxininduced significant tumor regression in patients with hematologic malignancies. However, in the past,investigators were unable to demonstrate the relationship between the level of IL-2R expression andtumor response primarily because of the inability to accurately measure the high affinity IL-2R levels.Monoclonal anti-Tac conjugated with a pseudomonas endotoxin or fusion toxin consisting of IL-2 andPE40 also have been developed to target IL-2 expressing cells. In addition, the monoclonal antibodiesprepared against IL-2 receptor induced remission in some patients with T-cell leukemia. These studiessupport the need for development of a rapid, sensitive, specific, and uncomplicated assay to measureIL-2R levels. Based on their experience with receptor transcript phenotyping (RTP) assay forerythropoietin receptor, the Investigators now propose to develop and assay based on PCR quantitationof IL-2R subunit messenger RNAs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and sorted tumor biopsies.They will design and test PCR primers specific for IL-2Ra mRNA and determine the tissue specificity ofthe RTP assay by screening several cell lines. The quantitative aspect of the PCR will be tested first bynormalizing dilutions of samples with internal standard such as GAPDH gene. The Investigators,however, will attempt to develop absolute quantitation of IL-2a mRNA by template competition. Finally,binding assays will be performed to determine by Scatchard analysis the affinity of binding sites onselected cell lines.",

Although several drugs are valuable for epilepsy therapy, their poor aqueous solubility does not permit effective formulation for intravenous administration. No IV formulation exists for carbamazepine (CBZ), a drug of choice for epilepsy therapy. Since therapeutic levels of CBZ in the brain are not reached for several hours following oral administration, other, less desirable drugs must be used when acute intervention during epileptic seizures is required. We will develop a formulation for carbamazepine suitable for intravenous administration. This will be accomplished using patented technology to convert this nearly water-insoluble drug into spherical, amorphous, uniformly-sized submicron particles suspended in a biocompatible aqueous medium. This technology has been applied successfully to other compounds to produce formulations for improved diagnostic imaging as well as for anti-cancer and antimicrobial therapy. Nanoparticle formulations have also demonstrated improved bioavailability following oral administration. Other administration routes may benefit as well. The intravenous formulation of carbamazepine will be subjected to preliminary pharmacokinetic and biodistribution evaluations to demonstrate feasibility. Phase Il objectives will focus on preclinical efficacy and toxicity studies. A Phase III partner will be sought to conduct clinical trials for NDA submissions and marketing.",

Our new approach to such systems is based on envelope coherence, and offers the following advantages:  (1) Its broad band detection threshold is 6 dB better than the conventional detector in typical cases; (2) It supplies the times at which the contact transitions between channels, more accurately than previous methods; (3) It automatically associates the broad band and narrow band features of the COI signature.",

A comparable low-cost engiine without TVC is being built on a separate contract. The TVC engine has DoD, NASA land commercial applications in low-cost upper stages. The propellants for this proposed engine are LOX and kerosene, with Hydrogen Peroxide used as the fluid that is injected downstream from the throat for TVC. The engine will use a simple, uncooled (ablative) chamber and nozzle to attain the economics of continuous wrap composite manufacturing processes. To demonstrate that robust liquid rocket engines, made with low-cost composite materials and proven processes, can be developed and manufactured at very low cost, we will build and deliver a full size engineering test model engine in Phase I. Phase II will undertake a series of test firings with different nozzle and TVC port configurations to verify reliabiliy, performance, and lifetime.",

This approach eliminates the control from the problem formulation, and exhibits robust convergence even for singular control problems. It thus shows great potential for application to both short-term mission planning as well as onboard flight computer implementation. However, extensive preprocessing is required to reformulate the problem in the desired differential inclusion format, and a significant amount of storage is necessary to obtain high precision solutions. The objective of this proposal is to alleviate or eliminate these limitations in order to utilize the differential inclusion technique in a turn-key manner to solve complex optimization problems for advanced space transportation systems. In particular, three innovative approaches shall be investigated:",

The unavailability of UV/VIS light sources makes these fluorosensors prohibitively costly and unreliable. Systems & Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) proposes to develop an embedded fiber optic near-infrared (NIR) fluorosensor which uses reliable and inexpensive diode lasers as light sources. The embedded fiber optic fluorosensor will combine (1) Phase Resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy (PRFS) to exploit fluorescence lifetime which is more sensitive to fluorescence changes induced by cladding immobilized, NIR fluorescent molecules complexed with metal ions produced by airframe corrosion, and (2) SPEC's digital optical phase-locked-loop (DOPLL) for strain, stress and vibration measurements. The system when integrated into the airframe will provide real time monitoring of the health of bonding joints and critical failure locations (e.g. fasteners, bolts, composite joints, welds) on an aircraft by monitoring corrosion by-products (metal ions). The envisioned system will feature the following technologies: NIR absorbing probe molecules; optical cladding immobilized with fluorescent dye molecules; fluorescence lifetime measured by PRFS; strain, stress, and vibration measurement by DOPLL; and optoelectronic miniaturization technology. The resulting system will be lOO times smaller and faster, and 1/4 the cost of existing commercial fluorosensors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The purpose is to assess the feasibility of developing a speech synthesis-by-rule system based on a new method for controlling formant synthesizers such as KLSYN88. The new method uses a small set (about 10) of high-level (HL) parameters which, in conjunction with calculated aerodynamic quantities, are mapped into values for the much larger set of KLSYN88 parameters. Previous research has shown that the HL method simplifies the specification of speech sounds, yet yields highly intelligible synthesis output. In addition, numerous regularities have been observed for the HL specifications of different types of speech sounds; this may raise the possibility that an efficient set of rules could be defined for synthesizing sound sequences automatically from symbolic input. The proposal seeks support for development of a subset of the rules that would be needed for a complete synthesis-by-rule system in order to evaluate the extent to which there may be increases in the efficiency of the synthesis rules and in the accuracy of the speech representation as a consequence of using HL parameters.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The long term objective is to develop x-ray systems that will minimize x-ray radiation dose to the patient during clinical diagnosis and routine screening, while maximizing the usefulness of data by applying advanced sensing and signal processing techniques. Near theoretical limit x-ray sensitivity can be achieved with advanced semiconductor detector arrays, so x-ray radiation dose can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude from that required by conventional screen-film systems. The inherently digital output of the detector array is ideally suited for Computed Radiology including electronic archiving and image transmission, image enhancement and analysis, and computer aided diagnosis. During Phase I, there are several specific aims: to produce a preliminary digital mammography system design to determine performance requirements for each of the subsystems; to design, fabricate, and test the critical detector arrays; to address the key detector packaging and system mechanical design issues; and to design the data acquisition subsystem and produce a detailed image display, enhancement, analysis, and archiving software plan.",

It has been demonstrated a workstation display model of the electromagnetically radiating body aids the user to efficiently experiment with and determine model parameters. In general, the geometric models obtained using CAD software can be translated into data files appropriately formatted as input to various EM codes. Visualization hardware and software also provide efficient means for displaying quantities such as surface currents, currents on wire segments, antenna radiation patterns and EM fields using 1-,2- or 3-dimensional representations. We propose to develop a visualization software system for EM analysis that will be designed as a generic package capable of operating, with minor modification, with several EM codes and, when possible, different hardware platforms.",

Innovative Dynamics proposes to address this problem by determining the sensor requirements for robotic tank inspection. An integrated sensor module will be developed containing an ultrasonic wall thickness gage, a video inspection sensor, and a capacitance-based corrosion/crack sensor, the latter adapted from previous NDE sensor work at IDI. The conbined sensor measurements will maximize the probability of detecting tank wall and tank liner defects. An evaluation of systems for registering measurements on the tank wall will be performed to enable precise and repeatable measurements. Automated fault diagnosis will be provided using a neural-network-based expert system. Lab tests on submerged tank wall specimens will be performed to evaluate the sensor module performance. Based on these sensor studies, deployment requirements will be defined during Phase II for the design and fabrication of an operational robotic inspection system. Cost effective solutions will be sought. Custom or modified commercially available robot types (such as the underwater remotely operated vehicles or magnetically-attached surface crawler will be evaluated which will fulfill these requirements.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         High temperature superconducting (HTS) thin films have important near-term potential for application in multi-chip modules (MCMs). Furthermore, recent developments in magnetic ferrite films for integrated microwave devices offer process compatibility with HTS MCMs.  For instance, the incorporation of monolithic ferrite circulators in HTS MCMs will permit sighnificant weight and size savings along with yield improvements. Manufacturability and cost, however, are still major issues for both defense and commercial applications. Thick ferrite films (50~150) are desirable for microwave devices; unfortunately, the low deposition rates of conventional thin film processes do not permit economical manufacturing throughput. Jet Process Corporation (JPC) proposes to develop its innovative, patented, high-rate, low-cost, pollution-free Jet Vapor Depostion (JVD) process for manufacture of high quality HTS thin films and thick nickel zinc ferrite films for microwave circulators integrated in MCMs. In Phase I we will develop JVD process for deposition of YBCO superconducting thin films and thick nickel zinc ferrite films on GaAs substrates. We will prepare and evaluate JVD YBCO microstrip and ferrite circulators. Film characterization and device performance measurements will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Gerald F. Dionne of Lincoln Laboratory, a leading expert in the fields of HTS and microwave ferrites, and Dr. Daniel Donoghue of Alpha Industries, Inc. In Phase II, we will design and fabricate a prototype composite structure, in which circulators made from thick ferrite films will be intergrated with HTS interconnects, in collaboration with the ARPA Ferrite Development Consortium. Phase II will thereby demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing low cost HTS MCMs and ferrite circulates, thus leading to Phase III commercialization. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: JVD processes for HTS MCMs and ferrites for microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) have great potential: 1) Military: active phase array radars, expendable decoys, navigation, missiles, 2) Commercial: commerciations, automobile radar and anti-collision system, local area networks, cellular radio",
