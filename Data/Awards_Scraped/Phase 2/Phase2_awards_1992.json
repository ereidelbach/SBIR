YET, THERE IS NO TOOL AVAILABLE FOR MEASURING TOTAL PEDIATRIC BODY BURDEN OF LEAD. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AN X-RAY FLUORESCENCE (XRF) INSTRUMENT THAT WILL ALLOW MEASUREMENT OF BODY LEAD BURDEN IN CHILDREN IN VIVO AND NONINVASIVELY. EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AUTOMATED STATE-OF-THE-ART ADULT XRF INSTRUMENT DURING PREVIOUS RESEARCH SERVES AS THE STEPPING STONE. USING A NOVEL DETECTOR DESIGN, A UNIQUE ANALYSIS ALGORITHM, AND INCREASES IN COLLECTION SOLID ANGLE TO IMPROVE THROUGHPUT, THIS PHASE I PROGRAM WILL PROVE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING XRF AS A PEDIATRIC SCREENING TOOL. THE ULTIMATE INSTRUMENT AFFORDS A UNIQUE CAPABILITY AS: (1) A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL IN DETERMINING THE PRESENCE OF ELEVATED BONE LEAD LEVELS, (2) A MASS SCREENING DEVICE FOR INDICATION OF CHRONIC LOW-LEVEL LEAD EXPOSURE, AND (3) AMONITORING DEVICE IN FOLLOWING PROGRESS DURING CHELATION THERAPY.",

UNLIKE THE CO2 LASER, 1.9-MU M OUTPUT IS TRANSMITTABLE THROUGH SILICA FIBEROPTICS,THUS FACILITATING OPERATIVE CONVENIENCE AND CONTROL IN THE STERILE FIELD. COMPARED TO THE AR LASER, THE 1.9-MU M LASER REQUIRES LOWER POWER FOR WELDING AND NO IRRIGATION TO PREVENT TISSUE DAMAGE. SUCH A SOURCE FOR WELDING SMALL-DIAMETER VESSELS HAS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER MANUAL SUTURING. PHASE I STUDIES WILL CONCENTRATE ON QUANTITATING THE INFLUENCE OF ENERGY DEPOSITION USING THE 1.9-MU M LASER IN VIVO FOR BOTH ACUTE AND CHRONIC VASCULAR WELDS VIA MEASUREMENTS OF THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF THE LASER ANASTOMOSES OF VARIOUS VESSEL DIAMETERS. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY MEASURING THE BURST PRESSURE OF THE LASED ANASTOMOSES AND NORMALIZING TO THAT OF RESORBABLE SUTURED ANASTOMOSIS.

THE PROBE IS INTENDED TO BE A RAPID SCREENING DEVICE FOR THE STATE OF PERIODONTAL HEALTH DURING ROUTINE DENTAL EXAMINATIONS. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE INFLAMED SULCUS IS ACCOMPANIED BY ELEVATED SITE TEMPERATURES. POCKET DEPTHS ARE ROUTINELY MEASURED DURING DENTAL OFFICE VISITS. THESE MEASUREMENTS MAY PROVIDE COMPLEMENTARY DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION WITH THE POCKET DEPTH SHOWING PAST DISEASE ACTIVITY, WHILE SITE TEMPERATURE CAN INDICATE CURRENT DISEASE ACTIVITY AND THUS MAY BE A POTENTIAL PREDICTOR OF DISEASE. THE TEMPERATURE-SENSING ELEMENT IS IMBEDDED IN THE PROBE TIP. THE DEMONSTRATED ACCURACY IS 0.1 DEGREES CENTIGRADE, SUFFICIENT TO RESOLVE DISEASED-STATE TEMPERATUREELEVATION OF 1 DEGREE CENTIGRADE. THE POCKET DEPTH IS OBTAINED FROM RESISTANCE MEASUREMENT. A SELF-CALIBRATING METHOD ELIMINATES SUBJECT-TO-SUBJECT TISSUERESISTIVITY VARIATIONS. THE POTENTIAL DEPTH RESOLUTION IS 0.25 MM. AUTOMATIC DATA ACQUISITION WOULD PERMIT A FULL-MOUTH, 168-SITE ASSESSMENT IN APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES. THE TIP SHAPE, SIZE, AND PROBING TECHNIQUE ARE SIMILAR TO A CONVENTIONAL PERIODONTAL PROBE.

THIS RADIATION IS HIGHLY COLLIMATED, HAS A BANDWIDTH OF 0.1% FULL WIDTH AT HALF MIXIMUM, AND AN INTENSITY EQUAL TO THAT OF SYNCHROTON RADIATION ON A PER ELECTRON BASIS. PXR IS PRODUCED BY A HIGH ENERGY (>1MEV) ELECTRON PASSING THROUGH A CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE; AS THE ELECTRON PASSES THROUGH THE PLANES OF A CRYSTAL, IT EXCITES THE CRYSTALLINE ELECTRONS ALONG THE PLANES. IF THE PATH OF THE INCIDENT ELECTRON IS PROPERLY ALIGNED WITH RESPECT TO THE PLANES OF THE CRYSTAL, THE RADIATION GIVEN OFF BY THE EXCITATIONS AT THE SUCCESSIVE PLANES WILL ADD COHERENTLY, PRODUCING DIRECTIONAL MONOCHROMATIC RADIATION IN A PROCESS SIMILAR TO THE BRAGG DIFFRACTION OF X-RAYS. INDEED, THE ENERGY AND DIRECTION OF PXR IS GIVEN BY THE BRAGG RELATION FOR THE GIVEN GEOMETRY. BECAUSE PARAMETRIC RADIATION IS EMITTED AT AN ANGLE TO THE ELECTRON BEAM, IT IS EASILY SEPARATED FROM THE ELECTRON BEAM AND BREMSSTRAHLUNG. THIS FACT, ALONG WITH THE NARROW BANDWIDTH, COLLIMATION, AND INTENSITY OF PARAMETRIC RADIATION MAKE PXR A PROMISING X-RAYSOURCE FOR NONINVASIVE DIGITAL SUBTRACTION ANGIOGRAPHY AND OTHER APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE INTENSE, TUNABLE RADIATION PEAKS. THIS PROJECT INCLUDES (1) DETERMING THE MAXIMUM PARAMETRIC X-RAY INTENSITY THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED FROM A CRYSTAL BY ANALYZING THE EFFECT OF THE CRYSTAL COMPOSITION ON THE MAXIMUM SUSTAINABLE ELECTRON CURRENT AND THE RESULTING MAXIMUM X-RAY PRODUCTION, (2) STUDYING THE USE OF LAYERED SYNTHETIC MEDIA TO PRODUCE GREATER INTENSITY BY INCREASING THE BANDWIDTH OF THE RADIATION, AND (3) STUDYING THE USE OF MULTIPLE CRYSTALS TO INCREASE THE RADIATION INTENSITY.

THE MOTIVATION IS THAT POLYMERS OFTEN HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES IN TERMS OF WEIGHT AND/OR COST. HOWEVER, THE DEGRADATION OF POLYMERS IS A LIMITING FACTOR IN MANY APPLICATIONS. THE THERMAL DEGRADATION OF POLYMERS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IN POLYMER PROCESSING AND IN FIRE SAFETY, WHILE THE BIODEGRADATION BEHAVIOR IS AN IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN. TO DESCRIBE THE DEGRADATION OF POLYMERS, ONE NEEDS TO KNOW THE CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND RATESFOR THE BOND BREAKING AND CROSSLINKING REACTIONS. BUT THESEREACTIONS TYPICALLY OCCUR WITHIN A CROSSLINKED MACROMOLECULAR NETWORK, SO THEIR EFFECTS IN FRAGMENTING THE MACROMOLECULE MUST BE TREATED STATISTICALLY. IN ADDITION, EFFECTS OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSPORT WITHIN A MATERIAL UNDERGOING PHASE CHANGES MUST ALSO BE INCLUDED. DURING THE PAST TEN YEARS, ADVANCED FUEL RESEARCH, INC.

THESE WERE THE TECHNIQUES USED TO OBTAIN THE FG-DVC PARAMETERS FOR COAL. THE POLYMERS' CHARACTERISTICS WILL THEN BE USED IN THE FG-DVC MODEL (MODIFIED WHERE NECESSARY) TO SIMULATE THEIR THERMAL DECOMPOSITION. THE SIMULATIONS WILL BE COMPARED TO THE LITERATURE DATA.

THE MORE FIRE RESISTENT THE MATERIAL, THE HIGHER THE TEMPERATURE REQUIRED. CURRENT COMMERCIAL INSTRUMENTS HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF OPERATING UP TO 400 DEG C. HOWEVER, IMPROVED MATERIALS, ESPECIALLY COMPOSITES, REQUIRE EVEN HIGHER TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS. ADVANCED FUEL RESEARCH, INC. (AFR) HAS AN EXISTING TRANSPARENT WALL REACTOR (TWR), MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS, AND KNOW HOW NEEDED TO DESIGN AN LOI TEST APPARATUS CAPABLE OF OPERATING AT TEMPERATURES FROM 400 TO 800 DEC G. THE EXISTING FACILITY PROVIDES A COLUMN OF PREHEATED GAS WITH UNIFORM TEMPERATURES OVER A VOLUME 80 MM IN DIAMETER BY 200 MM HIGH. THIS VOLUME IS SUFFICIENT FOR A TYPICAL TET SPECIMEN. TO DESIGN AN LOI TEST APPARATUS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE SPECIMEN HEATING AND COMBUSTION BEHAVIOR. TO PERFORM THIS FUNCTION, AFR'S TWR HAS A COUPLED FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED (FT-IR) SPECTROMETER CAPABLE OF MAKING MEASUREMENTS OF GAS CONCENTRATIONS AND TEMPERATURE AND SPECIMEN SURFACE TEMPERATURES. AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE FINAL TEST APPARATUS WILL BE THE MAINTENANCE OF A UNIFORM TEMPERATURE AT THE FLAME FRONT. SEVERAL POSSIBILITIES INCLUDING AN EXTENSION OF STANTON REDCROFT'S GRADED COLUMN HEATER AND THE USE OF A BUFFER GAS LAYER (AS IN THE TWR) WILL BE TESTED. WE WILL ALSO EXPLORE THE POSIBILITY OF SENSING THE FLAME FRONT AND USING A FEEDBACK LOOP AND TRANSLATION APPARATUS TO KEEP THE FLAME FRONT AT A CONSTANT ELEVATION. DURING PHASE I, WE WILL MODIFY THE TWR TO ALLOW TESTING OF STATIONARY AND TRANSLATING SOLID SAMPLES, AND MAKE MEASUREMENTS AT TEMPERATURES OF 400, 5000, 600, 700, AND 800 DEG C ON VARIOUS KINDS OF TEST SAMPLES. FT-IR MEASUREMENTS WILL BE MADE OF THE TEMPERATURES OF GASES AND THE TEST SAMPLE SURFACE DURING THE EXPERIMENTS TO ASSESS MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES, TEMPERATURES UNIFORMITY, AND HEAT TRANSFER PROCESSES....THE RESULTS WILL BE EMPLOYED TO DEFINE THE BEST CONDITIONS AND MAKE A PRELIMINARY DESIGN FOR A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM.",

AMAS IS DESIGNED TO ASSIST THE OPERATORS OF A PLANT EXPERIENCING ACCIDENT CONDITIONS.

ALTHOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE BASE NECESSARY FOR THE APPLICATION OF AMAS TO NUCLEAR POWERPLANTS MUST BE DEVELOPED BASED ON THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF NUCLEAR PLANT ACCIDENT SCENARIOS, THE GENERAL CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND REASONING ALGORITHMS OF AMAS MAY ALSO BE OF INTEREST FOR OTHER TYPES OF PROCESS PLANT APPLICATIONS. GIVEN THE COMPLEX NATURE OF THE ACCIDENT PHENOMENOLOGY AND THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH INSTRUMENTATION READINGS AVAILABLE UNDER ACCIDENT CONDITIONS, THE AMAS APPROACH FOCUSES SPECIFICALLY ON THE PROBLEMS OF IDENTIFYING PLANT STATES AND THE EFFECTS OF OPERATOR ACTIONS, WHILE UTILIZING THE UNCERTAIN INPUTS FROM PLANT SENSORS AND THE UNCERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF PLANT SYSTEM RESPONSES TO THE ACCIDENT.",

THE RELATIVELY HIGH ERROR RATES EXPERIENCED BY MEDICAL TECHNOLOGISTS IN PERFORMING THIS PROCEDURE IS ASSOCIATED WITH (1) THE TEDIUM OF EXTENDED VIEWING THROUGH A MICROSCOPE, (2) THE DIFFICULTY OF IDENTIFYING OFTEN SUBTLE DIFFERENCES IN CELL CHARACTERISTICS, AND (3) HUMAN DEFICIENCIES (MOOD, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, TRAINING). A GROWING SHORTAGE OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGISTS, WHICH RESULTS IN DELAYED TEST RESULTS AND ESCALATING LABOR COSTS, IS ANOTHER REASON FOR AUTOMATION OF THE BLOOD ANALYSIS PROCEDURE. PHASE II WILL INVOLVE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WITHTHE CAPABILITY TO PERFORM THE ENTIRE MICROSCOPIC BLOOD SMEARANALYSIS PROCEDURE (WBC DIFFERENTIAL, RBC MORPHOLOGY, PLATELET ESTIMATION) FOR UNDER $100,000.",

SEVERALCLASSES OF NATURALLY OCCURRING COMPOUNDS, INCLUDING DIACYLGLYCEROLS, PHORBOL ESTERS, AND INDOLACTAMS, HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO ACTIVATE PKC. THE LAST-NAMED COMPOUNDS INCLUDE TELEOCIDIN B, LYNGBYATOXIN, AND INDOLACTAM V. SINCE NONE OF THESE ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO RESEARCHERS, THE STUDY OF THIS CLASS OF ACTIVATORS HAS NOT PROGRESSED AS RAPIDLY AS FOR THE OTHERS. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE AN EFFICIENT SYNTHESIS OF A POTENT INDOLACTAM ACTIVATOR OF PKC. THIS IN TURN WILL PROVIDE THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY WITH A RELIABLE SOURCE OF THIS CLASS OF ACTIVATORS AT REASONABLE PRICES. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO DEVELOP A SUITABLE SUBSTRATE FOR THE PREPARATION OF A ((3)H)-LABELED INDOLACTAM ACTIVATOR OF VERY HIGH SPECIFIC ACTIVITY FOR USE IN RECEPTOR-BINDING STUDIES. THE EFFICIENT SYNTHESIS WILL PROVIDE A STARTING MATERIAL FOR FURTHER STRUCTURAL MODIFICATIONS THAT MAY LEAD TO NEW INDOLACTAM-BASED COMPOUNDS WITH ALTERED AND POSSIBLY USEFUL BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES. THE EXCITATORY AMINO ACID (EAA) NEUROTRANSMITTERS, SUCH AS GLUTAMATE AND ASPARTATE, HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN THE PATHOLOGY OF A NUMBER OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, INCLUDING EPILEPSY, STROKE/ANOXIA, AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. DRUGS THAT ANTAGONIZE EAA NEUROTRANSMISSION OFFER A NOVEL APPROACH TO TREATING THESE DISORDERS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ISOLATE NOVEL AND SPECIFIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS FROM PREVIOUSLY UNCHARACTERIZED SPIDER VENOMS. SPIDERS ARE A GOOD POTENTIALSOURCE OF THERAPEUTICALLY USEFUL EAA RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS BECAUSE THEIR VENOMS CONTAIN ANTAGONISTS OF THE GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR OF THE NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION OF THEIR INSECT PREY. PREVIOUS STUDIES SUGGEST THAT MANY SPIDER VENOMS CONTAIN ANTAGONISTS OF MAMMALIAN EAA RECEPTORS. IN PHASE I, SIX SPIDER VENOMS WILL BE FRACTIONATED BY HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY AND SCREENED FOR NEUROACTIVE COMPONENTS. NEXT, THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF THE ACTIVE COMPONENTS WILL BE DETERMINED USING ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL AND RECEPTOR-BINDING ASSAYS AS WELL AS AN IN VITRO EXCITOTOXICITY ASSAY. FINALLY, PRELIMINARY STRUCTURE ANALYSES WILL BE PERFORMED OF THOSE COMPOUNDS THATAPPEAR TO BE EAA RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS. IN PHASE II, THE COMPLETE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE AND CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS ROUTE OF PROMISING COMPOUNDS WILL BE DETERMINED, AND FURTHER STUDIES OF THEIR IN VIVO EFFICACY, TOXIC EFFECTS, AND BIOAVAILABILITY WILL BE PERFORMED.",

AN IMPORTANT BENEFIT OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO ADMINISTER RELATIVELY SMALL DOSES OF RELEVANT PHARMACEUTICALS SUCH AS DOPAMINE AND PHENYLEPHRINE TO BOTH STABLE AND CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS AND TO OBTAIN EXTREMELY USEFUL DATA REGARDING THE BEHAVIOR OF THESE DRUGS IN GENERALAND THE RESPONSE OF PATIENTS AT HIGH RISK IN PARTICULAR.",

GASOLINE ENGINES SUFFER FROM POOR EFFICIENCY, NOISE AND HIGH MAINTENANCE. TODAY, BATTERIES ALONE CAN PROVIDE RELIABLE POWER. WHILE ADVANCES IN THE LAST 20 YEARS HAVE INCREASED THE POWER DENSITIES OF BATTERIES, THEY ARE STILL LOW ENERGY DENSITY DEVICES NOT SUITABLE FOR PROLONGED OPERATION. AS DEVELOPMENTS IN PORTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND COMMUNICATIONS PROGRESS, THERE IS AN INCREASING NEED FOR MORE COMPACT, LIGHT WEIGHT SOURCES OF ELECTRIC POWER. THE COMPANY, AND COUNTRY, WHICH IS SUCCESSFUL IN FILLING THIS NEED WILL CLEARLY HAVE AN ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL EDGE. ANALYTIC POWER PROPOSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADVANCED, LIGHTWEIGHT, ION-EXCHANGE HYDROGEN/AIR FUEL CELL STACK. THE DESIGN IS BASED ON OUR 25 WATT HYDRIDE SUPPLIED, FUEL CELL STACKS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY BEING TESTED AT OUR FACILITY. ANALYTIC POWER'S COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS HAVE ALSO RECOGNIZED THE NEED FOR THE POWER SUPPLY WE PROPOSE, AND HAVE FUNDED ITS DEVELOPMENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

MANY ADVANCED ATR ALGORITHMS WHICH REDUCE THE FALSE ALARM RATE CANNOT BE EXECUTED IN REAL TIME DUE TO COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY. THIS LIMITS OVERALL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. IN ATR, THE FEATURES THAT MUST BE RESOLVED ARE LOCALIZED WITHIN THE FIELD-OF-VIEW (FOV) OF THE SENSOR. UNIFORMLY SAMPLING WITHIN THE FOV IS THUS INAPPROPRIATE; REGIONS WITH LITTLE OR NO RELEVANCE TO THE TASK ARE SAMPLED AT THE SAME RESOLUTION AS KEY FEATAURES, OCCUPYING VALUABLE SIGNAL BANDWIDTH AND COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES, AND INCREASING SYSTEM LATENCIES. A NEW CLASS OF MACHINE VISION SYSTEMS, CALLED FOVEAL SYSTEMS, IS PROPOSED FOR THE AUTOMATIC RECOGNITION OF STRATEGIC TARGETS. FOVEAL SYSTEMS FEATURES IMAGING SENSORS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING WITH GRADED ACUITY ANALOGOUS TO BIOLOGICAL VISION. FOVEAL SYSTEMS OPERATE MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY BECAUSE RESOLUTION IS TREATED AS A DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATABLE RESOURCE. THE DEVELOPMENT AND ANALYSIS OF SELECTED ADVANCED FOVEAL ATR TECHNIQUES IS PROPOSED.

TRAJECTORY ANGLE, ANGLE OF ATTACK (AOA), ROTATION VELOCITY, AND VELOCITY IN RELATION TO THE TARGET SURFACE. IF THOSE CONDITIONS ARE LESS THAN BENEFICIAL FOR PENETRATOR SURVIVABILITY AND/OR PERFORMANCE, THE WEAPON WILL ADJUST ITS ORIENTATION TO PRESCRIBED CONDITIONS. WEAPON DESIGNERS HAVE ASSUMED THAT THE OPTIMUM AOA IS ZERO DEGREES AND THE OPTIMUM ROTATION IS ZERO. THESE CONDITIONS MAY LNOT BE THE MOST BENEFICIAL FOR NON-NORMAL TRAJECTORIES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHAE I EFFORT IS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT CONDITIONS (IN TERMS OF AOA AND OFF-AXIS WEAPON ROTATION VELOCITY) FOR NON-NORMAL TRAJECTORIES ON A TARGET SURFACE THAT MINIMIZE WEAPON PLASTIC DEFORMATION AND/OR MAXIMIZE PENETRATION PERFORMANCE. THE LEVELS GAINED IN WEAPON PERFORMANCE AND SURVIVABILITY WILL BE DETERMINED IN ORDER TO ASSIST THE AIR FORCE IN DETERMINING WHETHER CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT IN THIS AREA IS WORTHWHILE. THE USE OF THE IDEALIZED IMPACT CONDITIONS WILL BE APPLIED AGAINST A MODELED TARGET TO DETERMINE IF THOSE CONDITIONS REDUCE THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF WEAPONS NEEDED TO KILL A TARGET.",

THIS RESEARCH PROJECT PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE TO CURRENT BRINE DISPOSAL TECHNIQUES. THE PROJECT INCLUDES THEDESIGN, ASSEMBLY, AND INSTRUMENTATION OF A SUBMERGED COMBUSTION EVAPORATOR TO PERMIT EXTENSIVE QUANTIFICATION OF SUCH PROCESS VARIABLES AS GAS CONSUMPTION, BRINE EVAPORATIONRATE, COMPOSITION OF EXHAUST GASES (WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO LIMITING EMISSIONS), AND COMPOSITION OF RESULTING CONCENTRATED BRINE SLURRY. THE EXISTING EVAPORATORS ARE BASED ON CONVENTIONAL BURNER TECHNOLOGY. IN LIGHT OF RECENT PROGRESS IN PULSED COMBUSTION TECHNOLOGY,WHERE OXIDES OF NITROGEN ARE PRODUCED AT A LEVEL HALF OF THAT PRODUCED BY CONVENTIONAL BURNERS, THE POTENTIAL OF PULSED COMBUSTION IS BEING EVALUATED FOR THIS PROCESS. TESTS ARE BEING MADE WITH FLUIDS REPRESENTATIVE OF BRINES PRODUCED FROM COALBEDS IN THE SAN JUAN BASIN IN COLORADO OR NEW MEXICO, AS WELL AS WITH BRINES PRODUCED FROM CONVENTIONAL OIL WELLS. THE EVAPORATOR USES COMPUTER CONTROL OF PROCESS VARIABLES. THE PHASE I STUDY WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE USE OF SUBMERGED COMBUSTION TO EVAPORATE BRINES PRODUCED AS A RESULT OF THE RECOVERY OF COALBED GAS. BOTH CONVENTIONAL AND PULSED COMBUSTION ARE BEING EVALUATED. IN PHASE II, THEEVAPORATION PROCESS WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH KNOWN MEMBRANE FILTRATION AND PULSE DRYER TECHNOLOGIES TO APPROACH A \"ZERO DISCHARGE\" SOLUTION TO THE BRINE DISPOSAL PROBLEM.",

FIRST, DETECTION PERFORMANCE CAN BE DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED (OVER TRADITIONAL CFAR TECHNIQUES) FOR THE DETECTION OF TARGETS IN SEVERE BACKGROUND CLUTTER, IN WHICH EXCESSIVE FALSE ALARMS ARE A TYPICAL PROBLEM. SECONDLY, MORPHOLOGYBASED ALGORITHMS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN VERY HIGH-SPEED HARDWARE BECAUSE THE FUNDAMENTAL OPERATIONS INVOLVE ONLY LOGICAL COMPARISONS (MIN AND MAX). THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS APPROACH MAKE IT IDEALLY SUITED FOR PROCESSING LARGE VOLUMES OF IRST DATA AT VERY LOW COMPUTATIONAL AND HARDWARE COST.

THIS DEVICE WOULD MONITOR THE ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENT IN ORDER TO DETECT AND SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL SOUNDS FROM BACKGROUND NOISE AND FROM EACH OTHER. IT WOULD IDENTIFY FAMILIAR SOUNDS. IT WOULD DESCRIBE UNFAMILIAR SOUNDS IN TERMS OF THEIR SIMILARITY TO KNOWN SOUNDS AND IN QUALITATIVE TERMS RELATED TO PERCEPTUAL NOTIONS SUCH AS LOUDNESS, DURATION, PITCH, AND ABRUPTNESS. PHASE I HAS TWO GOALS. THE FIRST IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A NOVEL TECHNIQUE FOR LOCATING ACOUSTIC EVENTS IN A TIME-FREQUENCY-AMPLITUDE CONTINUUM. THE TECHNIQUE CLASSIFIES SMALL REGIONS OF THIS REPRESENTATION INTO FOUR FUNDAMENTAL CLASSES AND MERGES REGIONS INTO ACOUSTIC EVENTS USING RULES DERIVED SOLELY FROM PHYSICAL ACOUSTICS. THE SECOND GOAL IS TO VERIFY THE UTILITY OF A PERCEPTUALLY BASED REPRESENTATION FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF SOUNDS. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED REPRESENTATION WILL BE COMPARED TO THAT OF A TWO-DIMENSIONAL CEPSTRAL REPRESENTATION, WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE USEFUL FOR ACOUSTIC PATTERN PROCESSING. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE RESULTING TECHNOLOGY WOULD PERMIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE POWERFUL ASSISTIVE LISTENING DEVICES THAN ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND OF ACOUSTIC MONITORS FOR OTHER MEDICAL AND WORKPLACE APPLICATIONS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ROBOTS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN BIOCHEMICAL OR CLINICAL LABORATORIES TO AUTOMATE MANUAL OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, CURRENT SYSTEMS TYPICALLY INVOLVE A SINGLE ARM ON A FIXED BASE (OR WITH VERY LIMITED MOBILITY) AND INTRODUCE RIGID ENVELOPE AND FLOOR-SPACE CONSTRAINTS. SUCH SYSTEMS ARE TYPICALLY OPERATED IN A PREPROGRAMMED FASHION AND CANNOT ADAPT TO CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS RESEARCH WILL EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE LABORATORY AUTOMATION SYSTEMS AND CONCEPTS THAT INVOLVE MULTIPLE MOBILE ROBOT MODULES MAGNETICALLY SUSPENDED FROM A COMMON OVERHEAD PASSIVE DRIVE SURFACE THAT DEFINES THE OVERALL WORK CELL ENVELOPE. EACH ROBOT MAY BE EQUIPPED WITH GRIPPERS OR OTHER CUSTOM END-EFFECTORS FOR INTERFACING TO LABWARE AND/OR ANALYTICAL EQUIPMENT OR CARRY VISION SENSORS FOR FEEDBACK. THIS CONFIGURATION RESULTS IN MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF THE AVAILABLE ENVELOPE, HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE THROUGH MULTIROBOT COOPERATION, BETTER MOBILITY, AND GREATERMODULARITY, RECONFIGURABILITY, AND REDUNDANCY. THE PROPOSEDROBOTIC CONCEPTS MAY ALSO BE USED AS TELEOPERATED OR TELEROBOTIC SYSTEMS FOR TOTALLY ISOLATED LABORATORY ENVIRONMENTS. IN PHASE I, AUTOMATIX, INC., WILL ANALYZE RELEVANT LABORATORY APPLICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS, PROPOSE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURES AND DESIGNS, DEVELOP LIMITED DEMONSTRATION PROTOTYPES, QUANTIFY PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS AND LIMITATIONS, AND ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED CONCEPTS.",

A SIMILAR PROCESS ALSO APPEARS ATTRACTIVE FOR REDUCING THE EMISSIONS OF VOLATILE ORGANIC HYDROCARBONS. HOWEVER, THESE PROCESSES REQUIRE LARGE AMOUNTS OF POWER AND MASSIVE BEAM GENERATORS. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ELECTRON BEAM PROCESS CAN BE INCREASED GREATLY BY APPLYING AN ELECTRIC FIELD IN THE INTERACTION VOLUME SO THAT AN ELECTRON BEAM-SUSTAINED DISCHARGE IS FORMED. AN EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM IS PROPOSED TO INVESTIGATE THIS NEW CONCEPT FOR A VARIETY OF POLLUTANTS WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSICS/CHEMISTRY OF THIS TYPE OF INTERACTION AND HOW TO MAKE EFFECTIVE USE OF IT.

IN ADDITION, UNLIKE OTHER RATE-CONTROLLED SYSTEMS, TRANSDERMAL DRUG DELIVERY AVOIDS HEPATIC \"FIRST-PASS\" EFFECTS AND GASTROINTESTINAL INCOMPATIBILITY, AND OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCALIZED DRUG DELIVERY. THE PRIMARY FACTOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LIMITED USE OF TRANSDERMAL DRUG DELIVERY IS THE LOW TRANSDERMAL PERMEABILITY OF MOST DRUGS. ALTHOUGH A NUMBER OF AGENTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT INCREASE THE TRANSDERMAL PERMEATION OF SPECIFIC DRUGS, THE UTILITY OF SUCH AGENTS, TERMED PENETRATION ENHANCERS, IS OFTEN LIMITED BY RAPID CLEARANCE FROM THE APPLICATION SITE THROUGH EVAPORATION OR TRANSDERMAL PERMEATION. IN THIS RESEARCH, BEND RESEARCH, INC., WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THE UTILITY OF PENETRATION ENHANCERS CAN BE INCREASED BY SUSTAINING THEIR DELIVERY TO THE SKIN SURFACE. THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT MICROENCAPSULATED ENHANCERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE ENHANCEMENT PROPERTIES OVER EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. BY SUSTAINING THE DELIVERY OF ENHANCERS, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE AMOUNT OF DRUG THAT CAN BE DELIVERED IN A SINGLE TOPICAL APPLICATION WILL BE INCREASED AND THE DELIVERY LIFETIMES OF CURRENT TRANSDERMAL DELIVERY SYSTEMS WILL BE EXTENDED.",

ALTHOUGH FERMENTATION AND CELL-CULTURE PROCESSES HAVE UNDERGONE MUCH DEVELOPMENT RECENTLY, ISOLATION AND PURIFICATION REMAIN THE WEAKEST PARTS OF THE OVERALL SCHEME. THE GOAL OF THE PHASE I PROGRAM IS TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF EMPLOYING \"AFFINITY MEMBRANES\" TO PURIFY HYDROPHOBIC PROTEINS. THE AFFINITY MEMBRANE CONSISTS OF A MICROPOROUS MEMBRANE IN WHICH THE PORES HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH AN AFFINITY LIGAND THAT SELECTIVELY BINDS THE DESIRED PROTEIN. TRANSPORT OF PROTEINS ACROSS THE FILLED PORES OCCURS BY DISSOLUTION INTO AND DIFFUSION THROUGH THE PORE. IN PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT, THE AFFINITY MEMBRANE WILL BE DEVELOPED AND USED TOSELECTIVELY EXTRACT ALPHA-CHYMOTRYPSIN FROM A MIXTURE OF TWOPROTEINS.

DESPITE MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT CHIRAL PESTICIDES SHOULD OPTIMALLY BE DEVELOPED AND MARKETED AS SINGLE ENANTIOMERS, MORE THAN 90% OF SYNTHETIC CHIRAL PESTICIDES ARE MARKETED ASRACEMIC MIXTURES.

ESTIMATED U.S. GAS RESERVES ARE ABOUT 1,000 TRILLION STANDARD CUBIC FEET (SCF), OR ABOUT 1,000 QUADS. ALL NATURAL GAS AT THE WELLHEAD CONTAINS CONTAMINANTS THAT MUST BE REMOVED BEFORE THE GAS IS TRANSPORTED THROUGH PIPELINES. CONVENTIONAL NATURAL GAS PURIFICATION PROCESSES ARE RECEIVING INCREASED ENVIRONMENTALSCRUTINY BECAUSE THEY RELEASE HARMFUL TREATMENT CHEMICALS ORUNDESIRABLE NATURAL GAS COMPONENTS TO THE ENVIRONMENT. PROCESSES BASED ON SYNTHETIC MEMBRANES ARE POTENTIALLY IDEALFOR THE ENVIRONMENTALLY ACCEPTABLE AND ECONOMICAL REMOVAL OF THOSE CONTAMINANTS. HOWEVER, CURRENT MEMBRANE PROCESSES CANNOT PERFORM MANY OF THE SEPARATIONS REQUIRED, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF LIMITATIONS OF COMMERCIAL MEMBRANE-MODULE DESIGNSAND CURRENT MEMBRANE MATERIALS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP TUBE-SIDE-FEED HOLLOW-FIBER MODULES BASED ON A NEW CLASS OF MEMBRANES FOR THE PURIFICATION (SPECIFICALLY,DEHYDRATION) OF NATURAL GAS. THE MEMBRANES IN THOSE MODULESCONSIST OF A HIGH STRENGTH, CHEMICALLY RESISTANT, MICROPOROUS, HOLLOW FIBER THAT SUPPORTS A HIGHLY SELECTIVE COATING ON THE LUMEN (INTERIOR) SURFACE. TUBE-SIDE-FEED HOLLOW-FIBER MEMBRANE MODULES CONTAINING THESE NEW MEMBRANESOFFER THE ABILITY TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE MEMBRANE MODULES, THEREBY GREATLY EXPANDING THE USE OF MEMBRANES FOR TREATING NATURAL GAS. PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT IS AIMED AT DEVELOPING THE HIGH STRENGTH, CHEMICALLYRESISTANT SUPPORT FIBERS NEEDED FOR THESE MEMBRANES. THE APPROACH IS TO COAT THE FIBERS WITH A PERMSELECTIVE MATERIALTHAT HAS PROVED EFFECTIVE FOR DEHYDRATION OF COMPRESSED GASES, INCLUDING NATURAL GAS. SMALL MODULES MADE USING THESE FIBERS ARE THEN TESTED ON A SYNTHETIC NATURAL GAS STREAM. IN PHASE II OF THE PROJECT, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE FIBERS WILL BE COMPLETED AND THEIR PRODUCTION SCALED UP TO A LEVEL THAT WILL ALLOW THE PRODUCTION OF SUFFICIENT TUBE-SIDE-FEED MODULES FOR INITIAL FIELD TESTS. PHASE II ISTO CULMINATE IN A FIELD TEST OF SUFFICIENT SCALE TO ATTRACT PRIVATE SECTOR SUPPORT FOR FOLLOW-ON PHASE III DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION.",

WHEN A REACTION MUST BE CARRIED OUT AT A SPECIFIC REACTION SITE, PROTECTING GROUPS ARE USED TO TEMPORARILY BLOCK OTHER SENSITIVE REACTION SITESON THE MOLECULE. SUBSTITUTED BENZYL ALCOHOLS ARE PARTICULARLY USEFUL AS PROTECTING GROUPS. THEY ARE PREPARED BY REACTING ELECTROPHILES WITH A SIMPLE DERIVATIVE OF BENZYL ALCOHOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL ESTER. ALTHOUGH THIS REACTION PROCEEDS IN EXCELLENT YIELD, IT RESULTS IN A MIXTURE OF ISOMERS WITH SIMILAR PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. SEPARATION OF THE ISOMERS IS TECHNICALLY DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE. THIS PROPOSAL IS AIMED TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL MEMBRANE-BASED PROCESS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. THE SEPARATION PROCESS IS BASED ON A REGIOSELECTIVE CATALYST THAT SELECTIVELY HYDROLYZES 4-SUBSTITUTED BENZYL ALCOHOL ESTER, LEAVING 2-SUBSTITUTED BENZYL ALCOHOL ESTER UNCHANGED. BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS OF THE HYDROLYSIS REACTION HAVE DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT PHYSICAL PROPERTIES, THEY SHOULDBE SIMPLE TO SEPARATE USING A MEMBRANE-BASED EXTRACTION/CONCENTRATION SYSTEM DEVELOPED PREVIOUSLY AT BENDRESEARCH.

        "abstract": "Abstract         TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMICS OF PRODUCING SYNFUELS FROM COAL, NOVEL METHODS ARE SOUGHT OF INTEGRATING COAL GASIFICATION WITH WATER-GAS SHIFT REACTIONS. BECAUSE OF EQUILIBRIUM LIMITATIONS THE WATER-GAS SHIFT REACTION (CO + H2O CO2 + H2) CURRENTLY REQUIRES TWO REACTORS FOR OBTAINING HIGHHYDROGEN (H2) YIELD. THIS PROJECT IS DEVELOPING A MEMBRANE REACTOR THAT CAN REPLACE BOTH CURRENT WATER-GAS SHIFT REACTORS WITH A SINGLE UNIT. THIS REACTOR WILL DIRECTLY COUPLE TO THE COAL GASIFIER WITHOUT ANY INTERSTAGE COOLERS, YET STILL OBTAIN HIGH HYDROGEN YIELDS. THE REACTOR WILL MAKE USE OF A NOVEL H2-PERMEABLE, COMPOSITE METAL MEMBRANE THAT NOT ONLY CATALYZES THE WATER-GAS SHIFT REACTION, BUT REMOVES PURE HYDROGEN FROM THE REACTION AS THE REACTION PROCEEDS, THUS DRIVING THE REACTION TO COMPLETION. IN ADDITION, THE H2 THUS REMOVED IS ULTRA-PURE REGARDLESS OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE FEED GAS, SO NOT ONLY COULD THE GASIFIER BE AIR-BLOWN RATHER THAN OXYGEN-BLOWN-LEADING TO CONSIDERABLE COST SAVINGS-BUT NO DOWNSTREAM SCRUBBERS WOULD BE NECESSARY. THE PHASE I EFFORT ADDRESSES THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS CONCEPT BY (1) TESTING THE STABILITY OF THESE NOVEL MEMBRANES AT HIGH TEMPERATURES (2) DETERMING THE EXTENT OF CONVERSION OF CO AND H2O TO H2 AND CO2, AND (3) VERIFYING THE EXPECTATION THAT COOKING AT THOSE TEMPERATURES IS NOT A PROBLEM. IF PHASE I IS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY, PHASE II WOULD FURTHER IMPROVE THE COMPOSITION AND FABRICATION OF THECOMPOSITE METAL MEMBRANE, DETERMINE THE OPTIMUM OPERATING CONDITIONS, AND COMPLETE A SYSTEM DESIGN AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS FOR A SPECIFIC COAL-GASIFICATION PROCESS.",

TWO STRATEGIES WILL BE PURSUED: SYNTHETIC PEPTIDES CORRESPONDING TO UNIQUE EPITOPES IN EACH OF THE THREE ISOFORMS WILL BE SYNTHESIZED, AND USED TO GENERATE IMMUNOGENS FOR ANTIBODY PRODUCTION. INADDITION, THE NATIVE MOLECULES THEMSELVES WILL BE USED TO INDUCE THE ANTIBODIES. PHASE I EFFORTS WILL BE DEVOTED TO PRODUCTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF POLYCLONAL ANTIBODIES. IN PHASE II, THE EFFORT WILL BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, AND THE ANTIBODIES WILL BE UTILIZED TO GENERATE ISOFORM-SPECIFIC IMMUNOASSAYS FOR MEASUREMENT OFTHE HORMONES.

ALSO, BY TESTING EACH PLANT UNDER DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, ONE CAN SELECT FOR IMPROVED RESPONSES TO DROUGHT, ELEVATED CO2, POLLUTANTS, ANDOTHER STRESSES. SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THESE PHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND YIELD WOULD ENABLE BREEDERS TO INCREASE NUMBER AND PERFORMANCE OF SUPERIOR HYBRIDS FOR A GIVEN AMOUNT OF BREEDING AND TESTING EFFORT, AND THUS GAIN COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES IN THE MARKET.",

BABIES CARRYTHE MATERNAL ANTIBODY FOR UP TO 12 TO 18 MONTHS AFTER BIRTH,SO ALL BABIES BORN TO SEROPOSITIVE MOTHERS WILL ALSO TEST POSITIVE. YET 40 TO 50 PERCENT OF THESE BABIES ARE NOT ACTUALLY INFECTED. IN THIS RESEARCH, POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR) ASSAYS WILL BE USED TO EXAMINE THE LYMPHOCYTES OF BABIES BORN TO HIV-1 SEROPOSITIVE MOTHERS FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE HIV-1 GENOME. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY SENSITIVE DIRECT TEST FOR THE VIRUS; IT IS CAPABLE OF DETECTING EVEN 10 VIRAL GENOMES IN LESS THAN 1 ML OF BLOOD. PERIPHERAL BLOOD LYMPHOCYTES WILL BE COLLECTED FROM ABOUT 80 BABIES BORN TO HIV-1 SEROPOSITIVE MOTHERS. SAMPLES COLLECTED AT BIRTH AND AT 3-MONTH FOLLOWUP INTERVALS WILL BE TESTED BY PCR AND WESTERNBLOT ASSAYS. THE RESULTS OF THE PCR WILL BE CORRELATED WITH THE SUBSEQUENT LOSS OF MATERNAL ANTIBODY AND SEROCONVERSION TO BABY ANTIBODY. THESE RESULTS WILL DETERMINE WHETHER PCR DATA CAN BE USED AS A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF ACTUAL INFECTION AND A PREDICTOR OF SUBSEQUENT SEROCONVERSION. THESE STUDIES WILL PROVIDE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA FOR THE INCIDENCE OF HIV-1 INFECTION IN BABIES BORN TO SEROPOSITIVE MOTHERS AND PROVIDE A BASIS FOR PREDICTIVE TESTS FOR AIDS IN THESE BABIES.",

IN CERTAIN CASES, HPLC IS THE ONLY LARGE SCALE PROCESS STEP THAT YIELDS THE PURITY LEVELS REQUIRED FOR HUMAN THERAPEUTIC USE. CONVENTIONAL ELUTION CHROMATOGRAPHY CAN BE CONVENIENTLY SCALED UP TO THE LEVELS REQUIRED IN MANUFACTURING, BUT IS EXPENSIVE, POORLY UTILIZES COLUMN CAPACITY AND IS DIFFICULT TO REPRODUCIBLE OPERATE. THE DISPLACEMENT MODE IS PERFORMED UNDER CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO CONVENTIONAL HPLC OPERATIONS, BUT INSTEAD OF A GRADIENT IN ELUENT STRENGTH THE FEED COMPONENTS ARE DISPLACED FROM THE COLUMN BY A CAREFULLY CHOSEN SOLUTION CONTAINING A COMPONENTTHAT IS MORE STRONGLY ADSORBED THAN ANY OF THE FEED COMPONENTS. THE PURIFIED PRODUCT EXITS THE COLUMN IN ADJACENT BANDS OF INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS JUST AHEAD OF THE DISPLACER FRONT. CONCENTRATIONS AND COLUMN LOADINGS IN THISMODE OF CHROMATOGRAPHY ARE TYPICALLY TEN- TO ONE HUNDRED-FOLD HIGHER THAN IN ELUTION CHROMATOGRAPHY, AND SO DISPLACEMENT MORE FULLY EXPLOITS THE COLUMN AND EQUIPMENT CAPACITY. THESE FACTORS, TOGETHER WITH SIMPLIFIED CONTROL ASPECTS, MAKE DISPLACEMENT CHROMATOGRAPHY A PROMISING MANUFACTURING STEP.

THE SYSTEM WILL HAVE A TWO-LEVEL TRAINING PROGRAM. LEVEL I IS DESIGNED FOR OPERATORS, OWNERS, AND DIRECT CARE STAFF OF BOARD AND CARE HOMES, FOR STAFF OF NURSING HOMES AND INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES WITH ELDERLY RESIDENTS, AND FORELDERLY PEOPLE LIVING INDEPENDENTLY IN THEIR HOMES. LEVEL II IS FOR TRAINERS. IN PHASE II, COMPUTER- OR VIDEO-BASED INSTRUCTION WILL BE DEVELOPED AS ALTERNATIVES AND COMPARED WITH INSTRUCTOR-LED WORKSHOPS. THE SYSTEM WILL HAVE FOUR COMPONENTS: (1) INSTRUCTOR TRAINING, (2) WORKSHOPS FOR DIRECT CARE STAFF AND ELDERLY PEOPLE LIVING INDEPENDENTLY IN THEIR HOMES, (3) A CONTINUINGEDUCATION PROGRAM, AND (4) A NETWORK TO LINK CLIENTS WITH CERTIFIED TRAINERS AND CONDUCT FOLLOWUP DATA COLLECTION TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TRAINING IS REDUCING FIRES AND FIRE FATALITIES IN HOMES OR INSTITUTIONS WHERE INDIVIDUALS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE TRAINING. SPECIAL NEEDS OF THE ELDERLY WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WILL ALSO BE ADDRESSED.",

UPON IRRADIATION BY A THERMAL OR EPITHERMAL NEUTRON BEAM, THE COMPOUND PRODUCES LOCALIZED RADIATION OF ONLY ONE OR TWO CELL WIDTHS THAT KILLS CANCER CELLS WITHOUT DAMAGE TO HEALTHY TISSUE AND BLOOD. BPA IS CURRENTLY USED IN CLINICAL NONRADIATION DOSAGE STUDIES IN THE U.S. FOR BNCT UNDER FDA INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG STATUS. BPA IS BEING USED SUCCESSFULLY IN BNCT CLINICAL TRIALS IN JAPAN FOR THE TREATMENT OF MALIGNANT MELANOMA. INEUROPE AND AUSTRALIA, INTENSIVE INVESTIGATION OF BPA IS ONGOING. THE L-ISOMER OF BPA IS PREFERENTIALLY LOCALIZED INTUMORS AND SKIN CANCERS. CURRENT PROCESSES FOR PREPARATION OF L-(10)BPA, THE BORON-10 ENRICHED FORM DESIRED FOR BNCT, CONSIST OF MANY LABORATORY STEPS THAT ARE NOT ONLY COSTLY AND LABOR INTENSIVE, BUT PRODUCE A LOW YIELD OF BORON-TEN ENRICHED PRODUCT.

RECENT STUDIES WITH COMMERCIAL DEEP UV AND I-LINEPHOTORESISTS HAVE SHOWN THAT THEIR PERFORMANCE FALLS DRAMATICALLY WHEN PRINTING OVER REFLECTIVE SUBSTRATES SUCH AS POLYSILICON AND ALUMINUM. THE FORMATION OF STANDING WAVES AND STRAY REFLECTIONS CAUSES A SEVERE LOSS OF RESOLUTION AND CD CONTROL. THE SIMPLEST APPROACH FOR CONTROLLING REFLECTIVITY PROBLEMS IS TO APPLY A LIGHT ABSORBING POLYMER FILM, OR ANTIREFLECTIVE COATING (ARC), BENEATH THE RESIST. ARCS HAVEBEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE PAST DECADE BY CHIP MAKERS WORKING AT G-LINE. THE HIGH ABSORPTIVITY OF THE ANTIREFLECTIVE COATING IS OBTAINED BY THE ADDITION OF DYES TO THE POLYMER COATING. TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH SUBMICRON PROCESSING, ANTIREFLECTIVE COATINGS FOR I-LINE AND DEEP UV LITHOGRAPHY MUST BE EXTREMELY THIN ( 0.1 MUM) AND PLASMA ETCHABLE. OBTAINING ADEQUATE ABSORPTIVITY WITH SUCH THIN FILMS IS DIFFICULT USING A CONVENTIONAL DYE-FILLED POLYMER COATING. THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS TO DEVELOP POLYMER COATINGS WHICH ARE INTRINSICALLY ABSORBING AT THE EXPOSURE WAVELENGTH. THIS INNOVATION ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR DYES AND ALLOWS THE OPTICAL DENSITY OF THE ARC TO BE INCREASED. DURING PHASE I WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE PREPARATION OF NOVEL INTRINSICALLY ABSORBING POLYMERS FOR I-LINE AND DEEP UV ARC APPLICATIONS. THE POLYMER STRUCTURES WILL BE DEVELOPED USING RESULTS FROM PHYSICAL PROPERTY DETERMINATIONS AND REALLIFE LITHOGRAPHIC TESTING.",

OUR NOVEL APPROACH CONTROLS THE PRESSURE IN THE PATIENT'S AIRWAY USING A UNIQUE JET NOZZLE AND VALVE SYSTEM. THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACH USES A VALVE PLACED AT THE END OF SEVERAL FEET OF EXHALATION TUBING. OUR NEW NOZZLE WILL JET GAS DOWN THE PATIENT'S ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE FOR INSPIRATION AND CONTROL OF EXPIRATORY PRESSURE. THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES OF THIS INNOVATIVE DESIGN ARE THAT ONE VENTILATOR CAN BE USED: 1) FOR PATIENTS RANGING IN SIZE FROM THE VERY LOW BIRTH WEIGHT PRETERM INFANT TO THE 30 KG CHILD; 2)IN EITHER THE PRESSURE-LIMITED TIME-CYCLED MODE OR A VOLUME CONTROL MODE; 3) AT BOTH CONVENTIONAL RATES AND HIGH FREQUENCY RATES (RANGING FROM 1 TO 660 BREATHS/MIN); 4)TO REDUCE CO2 IN VOLUMES MAY BE USED; 5)TO ASSIST THE PATIENT'S OWN BREATHING EFFORT, EVEN IN THE TINY PRETERM INFANT, BECAUSE OF ITS RAPID RESPONSE TIME CAPABILITIES. COMPLETION OF THE RESEARCH PLAN WILL RESULT IN A VALVE-NOZZLE SYSTEM WHICH WILL SIMPLIFY AND IMPROVE GAS DELIVERY TO INFANTS AND CHILDREN WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON MECHANICAL VENTILATION. IT WILL ALSO REDUCE RISKS RELATED TO PRESSURE AND RESISTANCE TO SPONTANEOUS BREATHING THAT ARE KNOWN TO ACCOMPANY CONVENTIONAL VENTILATION.",

BECAUSE THE COMBUSTOR IS AT A HIGH NEGATIVE POTENTIAL (TENS OF KILOVOLTS) RELATIVE TO THE GROUNDED BOILER, THERE MUST BEBETWEEN THEM A HIGH RESISTANCE ELECTRICAL ISOLATOR WHICH PASSES THE BOILER FEED WATER WITH MINIMUM PRESSURE DROP. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP SUCH AN ISOLATOR. THE ISOLATOR IN ITS BASIC FORM CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF ALTERNATING METALLIC AND DIELECTRIC RINGS THAT FORM A STACK SUFFICIENTLY LONG THAT IT CAN SUPPORT THE IMPOSED VOLTAGE WITHOUT EXCESSIVE CURRENT LEAKAGE THROUGH THE BOILER FEED WATER FLOWING WITHIN IT. DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THIS CONCEPT AND ITS VARIATIONS, AS WELL AS THE ISOLATOR DESIGN AND THE DESIGN OF A LONG DURATION TEST FACILITY, ARE BEING PERFORMED IN PHASE I. THE PROTOTYPE ISOLATOR AND THE TEST FACILITY ARE TO BE CONSTRUCTED IN PHASE II.

THIS PROJECT IS DIRECTLY FOCUSED ON EXPERIMENTALLY PROVING THAT THE DISTORTION/BOWING PROBLEM MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED BY PREPARING A POLYMERIC ALLOY THAT WILL PROVIDE INTERNAL CROSS-LINKING; THIS INTERNAL CROSS-LINKING OF THE POLYMERIC LATTICE SHOULD SUBSTANTIALLY LIMIT POLYMER DISTORTION/BOWING WHILE PROVIDING STRENGTH. A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES WOULD ACCRUE IF A SUITABLE BIODEGRADABLE POLYMER PLATE WERE AVAILABLE. ANY NEED FOR A SECOND SURGICAL OPERATION TO REMOVE THE METAL PLATE WOULD BE ELIMINATED, WHICH IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IN PEDIATRIC APPLICATIONS WHERE QUESTIONS OF GROWTH RESTRICTION ARISE WHEN PLATES ARE LEFT IN PLACE.

THE PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE CONSISTS OF A PASSIVE IMAGING SENSOR DRIVING A FLOW-FIELD COMPUTER, WHICH GENERATES MEASUREMENTS FOR A STATE/TIME ESTIMATOR AND DOWN-STREAM TERRAIN MODELER. A VIRTUAL IMAGE HELMET-MOUNTED DISPLAY PROVIDES THE PILOT WITH COMPUTED TERRAIN-RELATIVE ALTITUDE, AND AN IMAGE OF THE LOCAL TOPOGRAPHY.

THE USUAL DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED BY NUCLEAR PLANT OPERATORS ARE INCORRECT ASSUMPTIONS OF PLANT STATUS, INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION FOR FAULT DIAGNOSIS, AND INNACCURATE PREDICTION OF SCENARIOS THAT WOULD RESULT FROM VARIOUS COURSES OF ACTION. TO ALLEVIATE THESE DIFFICULTIES,THE HYBRID INTEGRATION OF ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (ANNS) AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED EXPERT SYSTEMS (KBS) IS BEING OPTIMIZED TO PROVIDE INTELLIGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SAFE NUCLEAR PLANT OPERATIONS. THE INTEGRATION OF ANNS AND KBS IS AN IDEAL STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS. IN GENERAL, ANNS PROVIDE \"SOFT\" CONSTRAINTS, WHILE KBS ALLOW \"HARD\" CONSTRAINTS. THE TWO METHODS COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THE HEMISPHERES THAT CONTAIN THE HUMAN MIND. ANNS, CORRESPONDING TO THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE OF THE BRAIN, PROVIDE ADAPTABLE PATTERN RECOGNITION AND CLASSIFICATION CAPABILITIES THAT CONTINUE TO PERFORM EVEN IF SOME PROCESSING UNITS FAIL; KBS, WHICH RELATE TO THE LEFTHEMISPHERE, INVOLVE A STRUCTURED, RULE-BASED REPRESENTATION OF EXPERT KNOWLEDGE AND STEP-BY-STEP DECISION STRATEGIES. THIS PROJECT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE COMPLEMENTARY STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EACH METHOD TO CREATE A HYBRID SENSOR MONITORING SYSTEM THAT CAN OUTPERFORM EITHER METHOD ALONE. IN THIS PHASE I STUDY, NEURAL NETWORK AND HYBRID NEURAL-NETWORK/KNOWLEDGE-BASED STRATEGIES ARE BEING DEVELOPED FOR INTELLIGENT SENSOR MONITORING CAPABILITIES WITHIN NUCLEAR POWERPLANT APPLICATIONS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         ASE-BASED REASONING (CBR) IS A POWERFUL PARADIGM FOR BUILDING EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH MANY ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER APPROACHES IN TERMS OF TIME AND COST OF KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING, EASE OF MODIFICATION OF THE SYSTEM, AND ABILITY TO CAPTURE EXPERT KNOWLEDGE IN DOMAINS WHERE STRONG DOMAIN THEORIES DO NOT EXIST. MANY CBR SYSTEMS DO A GOOD JOB OF HANDLING STATIC CASES (I.E., CASES THAT REPRESENT A SINGLE POINT IN TIME), BUT DO NOT HAVE FACILITIES FOR DOING TEMPORAL REASONING ACROSS A SET OF CASES. COGNITIVE SYSTEMS PROPOSES TO EXTEND ITS CURRENT CBR SHELL (SEE SECTION F. RELATED WORK) TO INCLUDE USER-FRIENDLY FACILITIES FOR DOING TEMPORAL REASONING. COGNITIVE HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED A GENERIC CBR SHELL WHICH IS CAPABLE OF LIMITED TEMPORAL REASONING (SIMPLE SEQUENCING) AND HAS USED THAT TOOL TO DEVELOP A CASE-BASED NATURAL LANGUAGE PARSER. WE ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN ONGOING DEVELOPMENT OF A MACHINE FAULT DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM WITH LOCKHEED AND OF A NETWORK FAILURE DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM WITH APPLE. BOTH OF THESE PROJECTS HAVE TEMPORAL ISSUES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED. COGNITIVE WILL USE THE EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM THESE PROJECTS TO GUIDE DEVELOPMENT OF POWERFUL NEW FEATURES TO AID TEMPORAL REASONING. NEW FEATURES WILL INCLUDE INTERFACES TO FACILITATE SPECIFICATION AND MANIPULATION OF TEMPORAL LINKS, AND ENHANCEMENTS TO INDEX GENERATION TO FULLY EXPLOIT ANY TEMPORAL INFORMATION WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE. IN ADDITION, COGNITIVE WILL USE THE EXISTING CASE-BASES AS A TEST BED FOR THE NEW FEATURES. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - INCORPORATING TEMPORAL REASONING ABILITIES INTO A CBR SHELL WILL ENABLE THE SHELL TO BE USED IN A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS AND DOMAINS WHERE REASONING ABOUT TIME IS SIGNIFICANT. IN ADDITION, BUILDING EFFECTIVE INTERFACES FOR REPRESENTING TEMPORAL INFORMATION WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING TIME REQUIRED TO SPECIFY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TEMPORAL INFORMATION. DEMONSTRATING THE FEASIBILITY OF ADDING TEMPORAL REASONING CAPABILITIES TO A COMMERCIAL CBR SYSTEM MAY ALSO SPUR OTHER COMPANIES TO DEVELOP SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS DEVELOPMENT OF PRACTICAL, MULTIVARIATE MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL (MPC) FOR FOSSIL POWER PLANTS. THE APPROACH USED HERE INVOLVES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GENERIC, REDUCED-ORDER MODEL (ROM) WHICH CAPTURES THE DOMINANT STATIC AND DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF POWER PLANTS. THIS MODEL IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PREDICT THE PLANT BEHAVIOR. SINCE THE MODEL WILL NOT EXACTLY MATCH THE TRUE PLANT STRUCTURE, THE PARAMETERS OF THE MODEL MUST BE ESTIMATED USING PREDICTION ERROR METHODS OR NONLINEAR LEAST SQUARES. THIS MODEL WILL THEN BE USED IN A KALMAN FILTER TO ESTIMATE PROCESS STATES IN REAL-TIME. THESE ESTIMATED STATES ARE USED FOR PREDICTION, ENABLING THE COMPUTATION OF THE OPTIMAL CONTROL SEQUENCE. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH BUILDS ON THE RESULTS OF A PRELIMINARYSTUDY WHICH ATTEMPTED TO DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY OF THE APPROACH. THE RESULTS WERE ENCOURAGING BUT MUCH MORE WORK IS NEEDED TO MAKE THE APPROACH PRACTICAL. IN PARTICULAR, THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF THE ROM DOES NOT ADEQUATELY MODEL THE BEHAVIOR OF A PLANT AND THUS MORE MODELING WORK IS REQUIRED. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THE COMPUTATIONAL BURDEN, WHICH CURRENTLY PRECLUDES REAL-TIME OPERATION ON A MICROCOMPUTER. SEVERAL APPROXIMATION TECHNIQUES CAN POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE BURDEN BY A FACTOR OF TEN. FINALLY, PARAMETERS OF THE MPC ALGORITHM (WEIGHTING AND CONTROL STEP SIZE) MUST BE EVALUATED TO ACHIEVE THE BEST PERFORMANCE. THE SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION OF THE METHOD WILL ENABLE INCREASED EFFICIENCY AND AVAILABILITY, AND REDUCED MAINTENANCE AND POLLUTION.",

THE RECENT DISCOVERY OF THE 30 K PEROVSKITE SUPERCONDUCTOR BA1-XKXBIO3 (BKB) OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLOIT THE ADVANTAGES OF GRANULAR GRANULAR SUPERCONDUCTING DETECTORS AN UNPRECEDENTED HIGH TEMPERATURES. OBSERVATIONS OF NON-BOLOMETRIC (QUANTUM) DETECTION BY GRANULAR SUPERCONDUCTING FILMS OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY OF DETECTORS THAT ARE BOTH FAST AND SENSITIVE.

IN THE PHASE I FEASIBILITY STUDY, A ROBUST O(N(4/3)) THREE-DIMENSIONAL VORTEX PARTICLE METHOD IS BEING DEVELOPED. THIS METHOD, BASED ON THE PROPER TREATMENT OF THE NEAR- AND FAR-FIELD VORTEX INTERACTIONS, IS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE CLASSICAL O(N(2)) APPROACH. IT USES BOTH LOCAL ANALYTICAL CORRECTIONS AND FAR-FIELD APPROXIMATIONS. THE METHOD IS BEING IMPLEMENTED ON A MULTIPROCESSOR COMPUTER, USING TWO SETS OF COMMUNICATION STRUCTURE. THIS STRUCTURE ALLOWS THE LOCAL AND GLOBAL INTERPROCESSOR COMMUNICATIONS, USED FOR THE NEAR- AND FAR-FIELD VORTEX INTERACTIONS, RESPECTIVELY, TO BE TREATED SEPARATELY. IN THE GLOBAL COMMUNICATION PROCESS, THE USE OFTHE FAR-FIELD APPROXIMATIONS IN THE COMPUTATION ALLOWS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN COMMUNICATION TIME. THE COMPLETED COMPUTER CODE WILL BE TESTED ON CLASSICAL PROBLEMSIN PHASE I, AND THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE METHOD AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PARALLEL ALGORITHM WILL BE INVESTIGATED. IN THE PHASE II EFFORT, FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS WILL INCLUDE THE COUPLING OF (1) A HIERARCHICAL DATA STRUCTURE TO IMPROVETHE ORDER OF THE METHOD TO O(NLOGN) OR O(N) AND (2) A CONSERVATION EQUATION TO INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS.

TWO LITTLE-USED PROGRAMS COULD HELP DO THAT. ONE IS A SYSTEM OF TOURIST INFORMATION CENTERS, AND THE OTHER IS A STATE-SPONSORED SIGNING PROGRAM, INDICATING HOW TO FIND LOCAL BUSINESSES. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL ASSESS AND COMPARE THE INDUCED INCREASE IN BUSINESS SALES WITH IMPLEMENTATION COSTS OF EXISTING SUCCESSFUL INFORMATION CENTER AND HIGHWAY SIGNING PROGRAMS IN OREGON, WASHINGTON, AND CALIFORNIA. IT WILL DEMONSTRATE THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF PROMOTING THE PROGRAMS IN UNSERVED OR UNDERSERVED RURAL AREAS. IT IS ECPECTED THAT THE PROGRAMS WILL BE SHOWN TO PAY THEIR OWN WAY. COST INFORMATION WILL BE OBTAINED FROM PROGRAM COST RECORDS AND INTERVIEWS WITH ADMINISTRATORS. SALES IMPACT DATA WILL BE OBTAINED FROM BUSINESS OPERATORS AND PATRONS. APPROPRIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES WILL BE USED, AND FINANCIAL MODELS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO EXPRESS THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN REVENUE, COST, AND RELEVANT INDEPENDENT VARIABLES. THE STUDY RESULTS ARE EXPECTED TO ENCOURAGE STATES TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMS AND ENCOURAGE RURAL BUSINESSES TO PARTICIPATE BY PROVIDING (1) ESTIMATES OF PROGRAM IMPACTS ONRURAL BUSINESS SALES AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, FOR THEPROGRAMS OPERATED SEPARATELY AND IN COMBINATION, (2) ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMS, AND (3) IDENTIFICATION OF THE INSTITUTIONAL OBSTACLES TO IMPLEMENTING A COMBINED PROGRAM.",

THIS TECHNIQUE HAS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER THE EXISTING TECHNIQUES OF EMISSION SPECTROSCOPY, CALORIMETRY, AND RADIOMETRY. THE ABSOLUTE NUMBER DENSITIES AND TRANSLATIONALTEMPERATURES OF OXYGEN AND NITROGEN ATOMS CAN BE DIRECTLY MEASURED, WHICH SHOULD IMPROVE PREDICTIONS OF SPACECRAFT HEATING BY SURFACE RECOMBINATION. VIBRATIONAL AND ROTATIONAL TEMPERATURES FOR MINOR COMPONENTS OF THE FLOW, WHICH SHOULD SERVE AS \"THERMOMETERS\" FOR THE OVERALL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION WITHIN THE FLOW, CAN BE DIRECTLY MEASURED. THE LIF TECHNIQUE IS VERY SENSITIVE, IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO BE USED ON MANY DIFFERENT SPECIES, AND CAN MAKE MULTIPLE SPECIES MEASUREMENTS (OR TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS ON A SINGLE SPECIES) INSTANTANEOUSLY.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE THE OIL WELL LOGGING INDUSTRY WITH AN INEXPENSIVE, HIGH SPEED MUD-PULSE TELEMETRY SYSTEM. THE ABILITY TO GET REAL-TIME DATA FROM THE BOTTOM OF A BOREHOLE WHILE DRILLING EXPLORATORY, DIRECTIONAL, AND HORIZONTAL HOLES FOR OIL AND GEOTHERMAL WELLS AND CORING ALLOWS DRILLERS TO DRILL FASTER. ADDITIONALLY, THE ABILITY TO GET REAL-TIME DATA ALLOWS DRILLERS TO WORK MORE COST-EFFECTIVELY AND MORE SAFELY, BECAUSE THEY ARE ABLE TO REACT TO CHANGING DOWN-HOLE CONDITIONS FAST ENOUGH TO PREVENT BOTH BIT AND SENSOR DAMAGE, AS WELL AS BLOWOUTS. IN THIS WAY, EQUIPMENT CAN BE SAVED AND ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS AND THEIR ATTENDANT CLEANUP COSTS AVOIDED. CURRENTLY, MEASUREMENT-WHILE-DRILLING TELEMETRY IS LIMITED TO LESS THAN3 BITS PER SECOND (BPS); IT CAN TAKE AS LONG AS 5 SECONDS TOTRANSMIT JUST A SINGLE THREE-DIGIT NUMBER, A RATE MUCH TOO SLOW FOR CLOSED-LOOP CONTROL. FLUIDIC MUD-PULSE TELEMETRY HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AT OVER 30 BPS UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS, BUT NO ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO IMPLEMENT THE TECHNOLOGY. VORTEX CENTRIFUGAL-PRESSURE FORCES CAUSE THROTTLING OF THE DRILLING MUD THUS PRODUCING WATER-HAMMER PRESSURE PULSES THAT ARE PICKED UP AT THE WELLHEAD. BECAUSETHE THROTTLING OCCURS WITHOUT MOVING ANY MECHANICAL PARTS, RESPONSE IS VERY FAST. RECENT ADVANCES IN VORTEX THROTTLE TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING ADVANCES IN STRATEGIC DEFENSE INITIATIVE TECHNOLOGY AND NUCLEAR FUEL REPROCESSING CONTROL)SUGGEST THAT IMPROVEMENTS BEYOND 30 BPS ARE POSSIBLE, AS ARECONFIGURATION IMPROVEMENTS THAT MAKE A SINGLE, MODULAR, MUD-PULSER VALVE IMPLEMENTATION PRACTICAL. IN PHASE I OF THE PROJECT, A HIGH PERFORMANCE FLUIDIC VORTEX MUD PULSER WITH A DATA RATE OF UP TO 50 BPS IS BEING DESIGNED. EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON A PRACTICAL, LOW COST DEVICE THAT CAN WITHSTAND DRILLING VIBRATIONS AND EROSION AND HAS REDUCED ACTUATION POWER REQUIREMENTS. IMPROVED METHODS OF ACTUATIONAND INTERFACING WITH SENSORS ARE BEING EXAMINED. IN PHASE II OF THE PROJECT, A PRACTICAL PROTOTYPE MUD PULSER CAPABLE OF OPERATING UNDER FULL FLOW OPERATING CONDITIONS IN A DRILLPIPE IS TO BE BUILT AND TESTED.",

THE FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SCANNING PROBE MICROSCOPES INCLUDE THE CAPABILITY TO POSITION A VERY SHARP PROBE WITH ULTRA-HIGH RESOLUTION IN THREE DIMENSIONS. THIS CAPABILITY HAS STIMULATED INTEREST IN EXTENDING SCANNING PROBE TECHNOLOGY TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF VERY SMALL STRUCTURES. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO FURTHER DEVELOP EXISTING TECHNIQUES TO USE A SCANNING TUNNELING MICROSCOPE (STM) TO MARK OR SCRIBE A SURFACE, SPECIFICALLY AS APPLIED TO THE LITHOGRAPHY PROCESS IN THE MANUFACTURE OF SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES. AS THE MANUFACTURER OF THE LEADING COMMERCIAL SCANNING PROBE MICROSCOPE, THE NANOSCOPE, DIGITAL INSTRUMENTS HAS NATURALLY ALREADY HAD CONSIDERABLE INVOLVEMENT WITH STM LITHOGRAPHY. OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE HUNDREDS OF ACADEMIC,INDUSTRIAL, AND GOVERNMENT RESEARCHERS, MANY OF WHOM ARE INTERESTED IN USING THEIR INSTRUMENTS TO SCRIBE SURFACES. BECAUSE OF THE INTEREST, SOME LITHOGRAPHY CAPABILITY HAS ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED AND PROVIDED TO OUR USERS. FROM THE EXPERIENCE THAT HAS BEEN GAINED WITH THE LITHOGRAPHY FUNCTIONS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO NANOSCOPE USERS, WE ARE IN AN EXCELLENT POSITION TO EVALUATE WHICH TECHNIQUES ARE SUCCESSFUL AND WHICH AREAS NEED FURTHER WORK. IN THIS PROJECT WE WILL USE THIS EXPERIENCE TO DEFINE THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR A SYSTEM TO CREATE PATTERNS IN SILICON IN THE 100 NANOMETER AND SMALLER SIZE RANGE, AND TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM DESIGN FOR SUCH A SYSTEM.",

TRANSPOSON TAGGING PROVIDES A POWERFUL GENETIC APPROACH TO ISOLATE GENES ENCODING ENZYMES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PURIFY, SUCH AS THOSE INVOLVED IN FA BIOSYNTHESIS.

THEREFORE, THE SPT::AC SYSTEM ALLOWS US TO SELECT PLANTS THAT HAVE UNDERGONE TRANSPOSITION.

SBK IS AN EXTENDED CONCEPT OF THE CONVENTIONAL KLYSTRON, WITH THE ROUND BEAM REPLACED BY A FLAT SHEET BEAM. A LOW PERVEANCE SBK IS DESIGNED TO PRODUCE PULSED HIGH RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) POWER WHILE OPERATING AT LOW VOLTAGE TO MINIMIZE RADIATION HAZARDSAND SYSTEM COSTS AND AT LOW CURRENT DENSITY TO MITIGATE SPACE CHARGE EFFECTS. MICROWAVES FROM SUCH A SOURCE CAN BE USED IN COMBINATION WITH MODERN PULSE COMPRESSION TECHNIQUESTO PRODUCE GIGAWATT POWER WITH SHORT (ABOUT 100 NS) PULSES. IN PHASE I, THEORETICAL AND NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS ARE BEING PERFORMED TO STUDY THE BEAM DYNAMICS AND RF ISSUES AND TO ESTABLISH A RANGE OF PARAMETERS IN BEAM CURRENT AND VOLTAGE,HENCE PERVEANCE, OVER WHICH SBK CAN OPERATE EFFICIENTLY.

OUR PROPOSAL IS A NOVEL SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WHICH WILL ENABLE A SINGLE WARHEAD, AND THEREFORE A SINGLE MUNITION, TO BE EFFECTIVE AGAINST A FULL RANGE OF TARGETS. THIS WILL BE ACOMPLISHED BY FIRING THE SAME WARHEAD IN DIFFERENT MODES AGAINST DIFFERENT TARGETS, POSSIBLY DEPENDENT ALSO ON STANDOFF AND TARGET LOCATION. EACH FIRING MODE IS ACHIEVED BY A DIFFERENT EXPLOSIVE INITIATION SCHEME AND YIELDS A PENETRATOR WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS. BY PROJECTING THE OPTIMUM PENETRATOR FOR EACH POSSIBLE TARGET-STANDOFF COMBINATION, LETHALITYIS INCREASED AND BEHIND-ARMOR EFFECTS ARE MAXIMIZED.

TO AVOID COLLECTION EFFICIENCY PROBLEMS, THE INSTRUMENT'S FLOW DUCT IS ALIGNED ALONG THE PREDOMINANTLY HORIZONTAL AMBIENT CURRENT AND IS ALSO ISOLATED FROM THE VERTICAL MOTIONS OF THE MOORED LINE. SAMPLE INTEGRITY IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE DEVICE MONITORS PARTICLES OPTICALLY WHILE THEY SETTLE. THIS NEW DESIGN INTEGRATES TWO PARTICLE MONITORING TECHNIQUES TO COVER THE WIDE SIZE RANGE OF MARINE PARTICLES: (1) A NEAR-FORWARD SCATTERING MEASUREMENT TO ESTIMATE THE CONCENTRATION OF PARTICLES LESS THAN 100 MICRONS IN SIZE AND(2) A SHADOWGRAPH TECHNIQUE TO MEASURE LARGER PARTICLES. THE PHASE I EVALUATION CONSISTS OF SETTING UP A LABORATORY VERSION OF THE SYSTEM TO TEST THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TWO PARTICLE SENSING TECHNIQUES.

ONE PRACTICAL PROBLEM WHEN ONE WANTS TO UTILIZE THE DYNAMIC LIFT AS A MEANS TO ENHANCE AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE IS THAT THE LIFT-OVERSHOOT IS USUALLY TOO SHORT-LIVED TO BE OF USAGE. A METHOD TO ENHANCE AND PROLONG THE DYNAMIC LIFT BY COORDINATED, SMALL-AMPLITUDE MOVEMENTS OF THE LEADING AND TRAILING EDGE FLAPS IS PROPOSED. OSCILLATION OF THE LEADING EDGE FLAP IS USED TO REDISTRIBUTE THE VORTICITY WHICH NORMALLY GOES INTO A SINGLE STRONG STALL-VORTEX AT THE END OF A PITCH-UP MOTION INTO SMALLER AND WEAKER VORTICES DURING THE COURSE OF THE WING MOTION. COMPARED WITH THE CASE WITH NO FLAP MOTION, THE RESULTING SMALLER LEADING EDGE VORTEX AT THE END OF THE PITCH-UP MOTION WILL TAKE A LONGER TIME TO GROW TO THE CRITICAL STRENGTH FOR DYNAMIC STALL TO OCCUR AND THUS THE ONSET OF STALL IS DELAYED. A COORDINATED OSCILLATION OF THE TRAILING FLAP CAN RESULT IN AN EFFECTIVE CAMBER CHANGE WHICH DELAYS THE CONVECTION OF THESE VORTICES DOWN THE WING SURFACE AND FURTHER INCREASES THE DURATION OF DYNAMIC LIFT ENHANCEMENT. THE GOAL OF THE RESEARCH PROGRAM IS TO DEVELOP AND DEFINE A DYNAMIC FLAP OSCILLATION METHODOLOGY FOR CONTROLLING AND DELAYING WING STALL DURING DYNAMIC SITUATIONS.",

THIS PROPOSAL OUTLINES A WAY THAT THE DETECTION OF THESE TOXINS CAN BE MADE MUCH MORE SENSITIVE WITHOUT USE OF EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT OR HIGHLY TRAINED PERSONNEL FOR THE FINAL PRODUCT. THE BASIS OF THE METHOD LIES IN THE USE OF COAGULATION-ACTIVATING SNAKE VENOM ENZYME CONJUGATES OF ANTIBODIES AND ANTIGENS AND THEIR DETECTION BY A NEW, ULTRASENSITIVE COAGULATION ACTIVATOR ASSAY CALLED ENZYME-LINKED COAGULATION ASSAY, OR ELCA. WE EXPECT THAT WE COULD MEASURE TOXINS WITH 100-1000X HIGHER SENSITIVITY THAN OTHER CURRENT METHODOLOGIES, BASED ON OUR CURRENT SUCCESS IN APPLYING THIS ASSAY TO OTHER ANTIGENS. DURING THIS PHASE I EFFORT, WE WOULD DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL OF THE TECHNOLOGY FOR TOXINS OF INTEREST TO THE ARMY, BY LABELING THESE TOXINS AND/OR ANTIBODIES TO THEM, AND DEMONSTRATING THE SENSITIVITY OF DETECTION USING THE ELCA ASSAY.

AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT YET DIFFICULT AND TIME-CONSUMING ASPECTS OF THESE STUDIES ARE THE OBSERVATION AND ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF THE TIMING OF INTRACARDIAC ELECTROGRAMS. CERTAIN PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONSMUST BE MADE DURING THE PROCEDURE ITSELF (ONLINE), WHILE MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS IS DONE LATER (OFFLINE) BY WORKING THROUGH THE LENGTHY STRIP-CHART RECORDING WITH A PAIR OF CALIPERS AND MILLIMETER SCALE. THE HYPOTHESIS OF THIS RESEARCH IS THAT SUCH ANALYSIS CAN BE DONE MORE SWIFTLY, ACCURATELY, AND ECONOMICALLY BY SUING MODERN COMPUTER TECHNIQUES FOR THE ACQUISITION, MEASUREMENT, DISPLAY, AND RETRIEVAL OF INTRACARDIAC SIGNALS. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM FOR CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY STUDIES. THIS WILL HAVE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE FOR: ONLINE MEASUREMENTAND DISPLAY OF ELECTROGRAM TIMING; CONTINUOUS DIGITAL STORAGE OF THE SIGNALS AND THEIR TIMING; AND RETRIEVAL OF SECTIONS OF THE RECORD, DURING AND AFTER THE STUDY, WITH RAPID DISPLAY, ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS, AND SELECTED HARD-COPY GRAPHICS. IN PHASE I, THE FEASIBILITY OF COMPUTER ACQUISITION, INTERVAL ANALYSIS, DISPLAY, AND STORAGE OF MULTICHANNEL RECORDINGS FROM THE ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY LABORATORY WILL BE DEMONSTRATED. IN PHASE II, EP SYSTEMS WILL DESIGN, DEVELOP,AND CONSTRUCT A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM AND PERFORM CLINICAL TESTING AND EVALUATION AT SEVERAL CENTERS.",

KETONES AND DIOLS, VERY SIMILAR TO ETHERS AND ALCOHOLS IN CHEMICAL STRUCTURE AND THERMODYNAMIC BEHAVIOR, MAY BE PRODUCED BIOLOGICALLY FROM COAL SYNTHESIS GAS AND MAY BE SUPERIOR FUEL ADDITIVES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO INVESTIGATE A SIMPLE BIOCATALYTIC PROCESS TO PRODUCE KETONES AND DIOLS FROM COAL SYNTHESIS GAS. BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES OPERATE AT ORDINARY CONDITIONS WITH LOW CAPITAL AND ENERGY REQUIREMENTS. MICROORGANISMS CAN PRODUCE OXYGENATES FROM CARBON MONOXIDE (CO) AND WATER, AS WELL AS FROM CARBON DIOXIDE AND HYDROGEN, AND TOTAL CONVERSION OF COAL IS POSSIBLE. MICROORGANISMS ARE ALSO QUITE SPECIFIC IN PRODUCING A SINGLE PRODUCT, SO THAT HIGH YIELDS FROM SYNTHESIS GAS ARE POSSIBLE. THE MAJOR AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DETERMINE THE TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES TO PRODUCE KETONES OR DIOLS FROM SYNTHESIS GAS.

THE PROCESS DESIGN WILL ENTAIL THE SIMULTANEOUS OR SUCCESSIVE DEGRADATION OF BOTH CONTAMINANTS BY A SELECTED ORGANISM(S) IN A SINGLE REACTOR CONFIGURATION. THE BIOREACTOR WILL OPERATE UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS USING MICROBIAL CULTURES WITH WELL-DEFINED GROWTH AND DEGRADATION CHARACTERISTICS. TO ACHIEVE THE PROJECT OBJECTIVES, ONE OR MORE ORGANISMS WILL BE IDENTIFIED THAT CAN DEGRADE EITHER OR BOTH TCE AND BENZENE. TOWARD THIS END, THE DEGRADATIVE CAPABILITIES OF ENVIROGEN'S OWN STRAIN OF PSEUDOMONAS CEPACIA (TCE DEGRADER) WILL BE DETERMINED FIRST. THE METABOLIC REQUIREMENTS FOR TCE AND BENZENE CATABOLIC ENZYME PRODUCTION WILL BE DETERMINED IN THE SELECTED CULTURES, AND ANY ADVERSE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MICROBIAL POPULATIONS AND CONTAMINANTS WILL BE ASSESSED.

ARMAMENTS ARE GENERALLY SMALLER AND RADAR SENSORS AND SEEKERS WILL OPERATE AT SHORTER WAVELENGTHS, OFTEN IN MILLIMETER WAVELENGTHS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIFIED ANTENNA/TRANSCEIVER FOLLOWING \"SMART SKINS\" TECHNOLOGY REQUIRES AN ELECTRONICALLY SCANNED PHASED PLANAR ARRAY AGAINST A PLANAR TRANSCEIVER IN A FLAT PACKAGE. RECOGNIZING THE HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT FOR THESE ARMAMENTS, THIS CONCEPT MAY BE ENHANCED OF THE PLANAR ARRAY (OR CONFORMAL) ANTENNA CAN BE RECONFIGURED IN THE EVEN OF DAMAGE OR THE NEED TO CHANGE THE ANTENNA RADAR CROSS-SECTION (RCS). THE PHASE I RESEARCH WILL HAVE THREE BASELINE CONCERNS: 1) INVESTIGATE MATERIALS OPTIONS FOR ALL ELEMENTS OF THE \"SMART SKIN\" PACKAGE IMPLEMENTATION, 2) DEVELOP AND TEST A DIGITAL PHASE SHIFTER TO FACILITATE SCANNING OF A PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED W-BAND PHASED ARRAY, AND 3), DEVELOP A COMPLETE, \"SMART SKINS\" PACKAGE CONCEPT FOR A W-BAND ARMAMENT SENSOR OR SEEKER RADAR. DURING PHASE II, THIS \"SMART SKINS\" RADAR MODULE WILL BE FABRICATED AND DEMONSTRATED INCLUDING CONFIGURATION AND PERFORMANCE MODIFICATION TO ALTER ITS RCS THROUGH MECHANICAL CHANGES IN THE PHASE SHIFTERS. IT WILL ALSO BE DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS RECONFIGURATION COULD BE DONE THROUGH CHANGES IN THE PROGRAMS WHICH CONTROL THE PHSE SHIFTERS FOR SCANNING.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A SPECIFIC AND ACCURATE IMMUNODIAGNOSTIC TEST TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF NON-ENZYMATICALLY GLYCATED LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) IN HUMAN PLASMA. THE TEST WILL BE AN ELISA CONSTRUCT THAT EMPLOYS MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY THAT SPECIFICALLY RECOGNIZE GLYCATED LDL, AND DO NOT REACT WITH UNGLYCATED LDL MOIETIES. GLYCATION OF LDL, THE MAJOR CARRIER OF PLASMA CHOLESTEROL, IS A STRUCTURAL MODIFICATION THAT AFFECTS THE ATHEROGENIC POTENTIAL OF LIPOPROTEINS, AND THAT INCREASES THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF DIABETIC SUBJECTS TO ATHEROSCLEROTIC COMPLICATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, EXPOSURE TO GLYCATED LDL LEADS TO INTRACELLULAR ACCUMULATION OF CHOLESTEROL ESTERS, COMPROMISES THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ABILITY OF LDL TO BE METABOLIZED BY THE LDL RECEPTOR PATHWAY, AND PROMOTES UPTAKE BY ALTERNATIVE RECEPTORS LEADING TO MORPHOLOGIC TRANSFORMATION OF MACROPHAGES INTO FOAM CELLS. THUS, MEASUREMENT OF GLYCATED LDL IN PLASMA OR SERUM MAY BE DIAGNOSTICALLY AND PROGNOSTICALLY IMPORTANT IN PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MELLITUS. HOWEVER, ASIDE FROM TIME CONSUMING, CUMBERSOME AND OFTEN INADEQUATE METHODS SUITABLE ONLY FOR RESEARCH LABORATORIES, THERE CURRENTLY ARE NO RELIABLE AND CONVENIENT MEANS TO ESTIMATING GLYCATED LDL CONCENTRATIONS IN CLINICAL SAMPLES. A SIMPLE AND SPECIFIC METHOD FOR MEASURING GLYCATED LDL IN PLASMA IS NEEDED NOT ONLY FOR ITS POTENTIAL AS A DIAGNOSTIC INDICATOR OF ATHEROGENESIS IN DIABETIC INDIVIDUALS, BUT ALSO FOR USE AS A REPRODUCIBLE PARAMETER FOR LONG TERM FOLLOW UP IN DIABETIC POPULATIONS TO ASSES THE PREDICTIVE VALUE AND RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATED LEVELS OF GLYCATED LDL. THIS PROJECT WILL EXPLOIT OUR RECENT DEMONSTRABLE SUCCESS IN CREATING UNIQUE AND HIGHLY SPECIFIC MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES THAT RECOGNIZE GLYCATED EPITOPES RESIDING IN LDL APOPROTEIN BUT NOT IN OTHER PLASMA PROTEINS AND THAT DO NOT REACT WITH UNGLYCATED LDL.",

RECENT DOE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN HEAVY ION ACCELERATORS TO BE THE DRIVER OF CHOICE FOR INERTIAL FUSION. IN ADDITION, STUDIES OF RECIRCULATING LINACS INDICATE LARGE POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS. HOWEVER, A RECIRCULATING LINAC PLACES SEVERE DEMANDS ON THE MODULATORS REQUIRED TO POWER THE INDUCTION CAVITIES. THE MODULATORS MUST PRODUCE A TRAIN OF PULSES EQUAL IN NUMBER TO THE NUMBEROF BEAM RECIRCULATIONS, TO A BURST FREQUENCY UP TO 50 KHZ. MOREOVER, THE MOST EFFICIENT DESIGNS REQUIRE THE PULSE DURATION TO VARY DURING THE BURST.

THE SENSOR SYSTEM UTILIZES A SHORT GAUGE LENGTH BRAGG GRATING SENSOR AND A MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUE WHICH PERMITS THROUGH THE THICKNESS (Z-DIRECTION) INSERTION OF THE SENSOR IN THE COMPOSITE FLEXBEAM WITHOUT DEGRADATION OF PART PROPERTIES. FIBER OPTIC STRESS/STRAIN SENSORS PLACED IN THE Z-DIRECTION WILL BE FAR MORE SENSITIVE TO PLY DELAMINATION THAN CONVENTIONAL IN-PLANE SENSORS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPLETE SENSOR SYSTEM WILL PERMIT THE INSPECTION OF THE FLEXBEAM WITH A GROUND BASED INSTRUMENT WITHOUT THE REMOVAL OF THE PITCH CASE ENCLOSURE. THE PHASE I PROGRAM WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT FOSTER-MILLER'S FIBER INSERTION TECHNOLOGY CAN SUCCESSFULLY INSERT SELECTED FIBER OPTIC SENSORS INTO A TYPICAL FLEXBEAM LAMINATE IN THE TRANSLAMINAR DIRECTION AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SENSOR SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF SENSING PLY DELAMINATION PRIOR TO FAILURE.",

THE MULTIRATE ORTHOGONAL SAMPLING (MOS) TECHNIQUE PRESENTED IS AN INNOVATIVE, YET INTUITIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM OF CO-CHANNEL INTERFERENCE. THE PREMISE OF THE MOS TECHNIQUE RELIES ON TWO FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF COMMUNICATION SIGNALS: (1) THE SIGNALS ARE CARRIER-BORNE I.E. THE INFORMATION SIGNAL HAS BEEN MODULATED ON TO A HIGH FREQUENCY CARRIER, AND (2) THE BANDWIDTH OF THE INFORMATION SIGNAL IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN CARRIER FREQUENCY. MOS DIVERGES FROM CONVENTIONAL DEMODULATION/ SUPPRESSION METHODS BY RECASTING THE PROBLEM TO ONE INVOLVING MULTIPLE WAVEFORM ESTIMATION. MOS DERIVES A SOLUTION BY CONSIDERING THE DEMODULATION/SUPPRESSION SIMULTANEOUSLY AS ONE OPTIMAL PARAMETER ESTIMATION PROBLEM. FOR TWO INTERFERING SINUSOIDS, THE BEST ESTIMATE OF ONE WAVEFORM IS OBTAINED WHEN THE COMPOSITE WAVEFORM IS SAMPLED AT A ZERO-CROSSING OF THE OTHER. MOS IS CONVENIENTLY IMPLEMENTED AS A SET OF MULTI-RATE SAMPLERS THAT COOPERATIVELY DEVELOP OPTIMAL SAMPLE CLOCKS TO PROVIDE INTERFERENCE SUPPRESSED ESTIMATES.

THE GOAL IS TO AUTOMATE THE SOLVENT DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR THE WAFER DNA SYNTHESIS DEVICE AND TO EVENTUALLY AUTOMATE ALL ASPECTS OF THE DEVICE. ONCE COMPLETE AUTOMATION IS ACHIEVED, THE WAFER DNA SYNTHESIS DEVICE IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE THE REAGENT COST PER BASE ADDITION FROM THE CURRENT TWO TO FIVE DOLLARS (0.2 UMOL SCALE OF SYNTHESIS BY CONVENTIONAL DNA SYNTHESIZERS) TO UNDER FIFTY CENTS. THE PERFORMANCE CAPABILITY OF ONE AUTOMATED MACHINE WITH ITS FASTER PRODUCTION TIME AND LOWER COST OF PRODUCTION SHOULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE COST AND TIME ASSOCIATED WITH SEQUENCING PROJECTS, GENE SYNTHESIS, PROTEIN ENGINEERING, DNA AMPLIFICATION, PROBE OPTIMIZATION AND OTHER GENETIC ENGINEERING RESEARCH. WITH THE NEED FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS TO MILLIONS OF POLYNUCLEOTIDES FOR THE HUMAN GENOME PROJECT ALONE, WE BELIEVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SEMI-AUTOMATED WAFER DNA SYNTHESIZER INTO A FULLY AUTOMATED MACHINE WILL HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT IN THE PROGRESS OF DNA RELATED RESEARCH.",

THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES OF THIS PROCESS MODIFICATION INCLUDE ENHANCED NUTRIENT REMOVAL, FILAMENTOUS SLUDGE BULKING CONTROL, AND ENERGY SAVINGS. THE PROCESS IS BASED ON A STRATEGY THAT MAXIMIZES THE USE OF INFLUENT SOLUBLE BOD (SBOD) UNDER ANOXIC CONDITIONS.

THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A PROTOTYPE AUTOMATED ANALYZER FOR OBJECTIVELY EVALUATING RABBIT (AND OTHER) SEMEN, IN WHICH THE ERRORS CAUSED BY INTERFERING GRANULES AND BY HIGH SPERM VELOCITY ARE ELIMINATED. THIS PROTOTYPE WILL USE A STROBOSCOPIC PHASE-CONTRAST OPTICAL SYSTEM SPECIALLY ADAPTED BOTH TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN SPERM AND GRANULES AND TO REDUCE VELOCITY-INDUCED IMAGE BLURRING TO INSIGNIFICANT LEVELS. MORPHOMETRIC ANALYSIS WILL ALSO BE USED AS AN ADDITIONAL DISCRIMINATOR IFNECESSARY. THE CRITICAL EXPERIMENTS TO VALIDATE THE ALGORITHMS FOR GRANULE DISCRIMINATION WILL BE PERFORMED BY HARVESTING GRANULES AND ADDING THEM BACK, IN KNOWN AMOUNTS, TO GRANULE-FREE, POOLED SEMEN SAMPLES. WITH THESE IMPROVEMENTS, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO ACCURATELY, CONVENIENTLY, AND RAPIDLY DETERMINE SPERM CONCENTRATION, MOTILITY, AND VELOCITY.",

A SUBSTANCE THAT COULD DIRECTLY AND SPECIFICALLY STIMULATE THE CILIARY GANGLION MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF TREATING THESE DISORDERS. A NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR (NTF) HAS BEEN PURIFIED FROM PIG LUNG THAT SHOULD BE USEFUL IN TREATING GLAUCOMA AND PRESBYOPIA. THE MOLECULAR WEIGHT, MAMMALIAN TISSUE SOURCE, NEURONAL SPECIFICITY, AND AMINO ACID COMPOSITION INDICATE THAT IT IS DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUSLY REPORTED NEUROTROPHIC FACTORS.

THE DEMAND FOR BLOOD PRODUCTS FOR SUPPORT OF IMMUNOSUPPRESSED PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY AND ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION INCREASES THE RISK OF TRANSFUSION ASSOCIATED VIRAL DISEASE. THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM TO INACTIVATE PATHOGENS IN BLOOD PRODUCTS. A PHOTOCHEMICAL DECONTAMINATION (PCD) PROCEDURE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED WHICH UTILIZES 8-METHOXYPSORALEN (8-MOP) AND LONG WAVELENGTH ULTRAVIOLET (UVA) LIGHT TO INACTIVATE PATHOGENS IN PLATELET CONCENTRATES (PC) WHILE MAINTAINING ACCEPTABLE PLATELET FUNCTION (LIN ET AL., BLOOD 74\"517, 1989). WE SEEK TO DEVELOP A SIMPLE MEANS TO VALIDATE INACTIVATION OF HUMAN PATHOGENS AFTER TREATMENT BY PCD. WE WILL USE INHIBITION OF THE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR) AS A MEASURE OF THE EXTENT OF THE PHOTOREACTION BETWEEN NUCLEIC ACID AND PSORALEN IN A PCD TREATED PLATELET CONCENTRATE. THE INITIAL DEMONSTRATION OF THIS TECHNIQUE WILL BE A CORRELATION OF THE INHIBITION OF PCR AMPLIFICATION OF CELLULAR DNA FROM A PCD TREATED PC WITH THE KINETICS OF INACTIVATION OF HIV-1 AND THE LEVEL OF PHOTOMODIFICATION OF THE CELLULAR DNA. THIS OBJECTIVE WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUAL SPECIFIC AIMS. 1. HIV-1 INFECTED H9 CELLS WILL BE SEEDED INTO PLATELET CONCENTRATES. THE CONCENTRATES WILL THEN BE TREATED WITH 8-MOP PLUS UVA LIGHT FOR VARIOUS TIMES. THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF HIV-1 WILL BE MONITORED BY A RAPID MICROPLAQUE ASSAY (HANSON ET AL., J. CLIN. MICRO. 28: 1990). THE INACTIVATION WILL UTILIZE HIGH INTENSITY UVA LAMPS TO DECREASE THE IRRADIATION TIME BY A FACTOR OF 10. 2. THE EXTENT OF PHOTOMODIFICATION OF CELLULAR DNA WILL BE DETERMINED USING 3H-8-MOP. 3. THE INHIBITION OF PCR WILL BE CORRELATED WITH THE LEVEL OF 8-MOP MODIFICATION OF CELLULAR DNA AND WITH THE LOSS OF BIOLOGICAL TITER OF HIV-1. 4. THE EFFECTS OF PHOTODECONTAMINATION TREATMENT ON THE PLATELETS WILL BE ASSESSED BY MEASURING: PLATELET YIELD, EXTRACELLULAR PH, PO2, PCO2, DENSE BODY (ATP) SECRETION, EXTRACELLULAR LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE AND ALPHA-GRANULE SECRETION. SPECIFIC AIMS 2, 3 AND 4 WILL UTILIZE PLATELET CONCENTRATES SEEDED WITH UNINFECTED H9 CELLS TO ELIMINATE ANY HIV-1, BIOHAZARD IN HANDLING THESE SAMPLES.",

SUCH A SWITCH OPERATES BY USING AN EXTERNAL PLASMA SOURCE TO SHORT A GAP WHICH CONDUCTS CURRENT FROM A LOW VOLTAGE CAPACITIVE SOURCE FOR 100 NANOSECOND TIME SCALES. AT A CRITICAL CURRENT DENSITY THE PLASMA ERODES AND THE SWITCH OPENS ON A 10 NANOSECOND TIME SCALE TRANSFERRING A MULTIPLIED VOLTAGE TO THE LOAD. THE GAP PLASMA CONDUCTS IN A DIFFUSE MANNER THROUGHOUT THE OPERATION OF THE PEOS, A PHENOMENA WHICH CAN BE ACHIEVED IN SIMULATIONS ONLY BY INVOKING AN ANOMALOUS RESISTIVITY. A LIKELY SOURCE FOR THIS RESISTIVITY IS STREAMING PLASMA INSTABILITIES WHICH ARE MANIFESTED BY THE GROWTH OF ION ACOUSTIC WAVES. RESONANT-RAYLEIGH SCATTERING IS PROPOSED AS A METHOD TO DIRECTLY VERIFY THE EXISTENCE OF THESE INSTABILITIES AND TO STUDY THEIR PROPERTIES IN THE PEOS PLASMA. AT A WAVELENGTH NEAR AN ATOMIC TRANSITION THE RAYLEIGH LIGHT SCATTERING CROSS SECTION IS ENHANCED BY UP TO TEN ORDERS TO MAGNITUDE. WITH TYPICAL PULSED DYE LASER POWERS, THIS ALLOWS ONE TO DETECT ATOMIC OR IONIC SPECIES WITH DENSITIES AS LOW AS 10(10)CM(-3) WELL WITHIN THE RANGE OF PEOS PLASMAS.",

SEVERAL QUESTIONS ARE FREQUENTLY RAISED THAT REMAIN UNANSWERED. THESE QUESTIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: (1) HOW CLOSE TO THE THEORETICAL JC PREDICTED BY PINNING THEORY CAN BE ACHIEVED IN PRACTICE IN MONOFILAMENTS AND IN MULTIFILAMENTARY MATERIALS, (2) WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT EXTRINSIC FACTORS LIMITING THE JC IN MULTIFILAMENTARY MATERIALS, AND (3) WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PIECELENGTH, JC, AND FILAMENT SIZE? THIS PROJECT ATTEMPTS TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS AS THEY AFFECT MULTIFILAMENTARY NBTI MATERIALS SUCH AS THOSE USED INTHE SUPERCONDUCTING SUPER COLLIDER (SSC). IN PHASE I, THE EFFECT ON JC OF REDUCING THE SPACING-TO-DIAMETER RATIO BELOWTHAT NORMALLY USED IN THE STANDARD SSC MATERIAL IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE USE OF SMALL TRIAL BILLETS. THE EFFECTS ARE BEING OBSERVED AT DIFFERENT FILAMENT DIAMETERS TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT, IF ANY, PRICE IS PAID IN JC OF THE NBTI BY REQUIRING FINE FILAMENTS. IN PHASE II, SCALE-UP WILL BE CARRIED OUT AND EFFORTS MADE TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF THEVARIOUS CONDITIONS ON PIECELENGTH AS WELL AS JC.",

THE MATERIAL WAS PRODUCED IN LONG PIECELENGTHS. A SIMILAR CONDUCTOR DESIGN THAT USED (NBTI)3SN (NIOBIUM-TITANIUM-TIN) WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE LAWRENCE LIVERMORE LABORATORY FOR USE IN THEIR POP COIL PROGRAM. THIS CONDUCTOR, WHICH WAS PRODUCED IN LARGE QUANTITIES, SUFFERED FROM POOR AND VARIABLE PIECELENGTHS. ALTHOUGH THE EXACT REASON FOR THIS DIFFERENCE IN BEHAVIOR ISNOT KNOXWN FOR CERTAIN, IT MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE APPARENT HIGH WORK-HARDENING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE TI-CONTAINING ALLOY COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE TA ALLOY. TI IS CHEAPER THAN TA, AND LESS IS REQUIRED TO GIVE SUPERIOR PROPERTIES IN THE INTERMEDIATE FIELD REGION REQUIRED BY THE INTERNATIONAL THERMONUCLEAR EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR (ITER) AND SIMILIAR FUSION DEVICES. CONSIDERABLE INCENTIVE EXISTS TO OVERCOME THIS PIECELENGTH PROBLEM. BECAUSE MINIMAL PROBLEMSOF THIS NATURE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST WHEN USING PURE NB RODS IN A COPPER (CU) MATRIX, THESE RODS ARE EMPLOYED IN THIS WORK. TH TI, NECESSARY FOR THE HIGH FIELD PROPERTIES, IS INTRODUCED BY INCORPORATING IT INTO THE MATRIX AS A CUTI ALLOY, AS IN THE BRONZE PROCESS. PHASE I IS CONCERNED WITH COMPARING THE PROPERTIES OBTAINED FROM A TIRAL BILLET WITH NB RODS AND A CUTI ALLOY MATRIX WITH A SIMILIAR DESIGN OF CONTROL BILLET WITH NB-ONE WT% TI RODS AND A CU MATRIX. IN THE PAST, PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED WHEN ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO COLD BOND HARD SUBELEMENTS IN THE TIN-CORE PROCESS. THE RECENTLY DEVELOPEDTUBULAR-TIN-SOURCE (TTS PROCESS HAS PROVED TO BE FAR LESS SENSITIVE TO THE HARDNESS OF THE MATRIX BECAUSE A HOT ISOSTATIC PROCESSING STEP IS USED, AND NO COLD RESTACKING OFSUBELEMENTS IS INVOLVED. THIS WAS PROVED RECENTLY WITH MATERIAL MADE WITH DISPERSION-HARDENED CU SURROUNDING THE FILAMENTS. FOR THIS REASON, THE TTS PROCESS IS BEING USED FOR BOTH BILLETS MADE IN THIS WORK.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ARMY ARMAMENT DEVICES ARE CONTROLLED FOR SAFETY AND OPTIMUM PERFORMANCE BY A COMPLEX FUZE MECHANISM. FUZES ARE DESIGNED BY COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN (CAD), FABRICATED BY HAND, AND TRANSPORTED SEPARATELY FROM THE EXPLOSIVE CHARGE OF THE ARMAMENT FOR SAFETY. EACH FUZE IS INSPECTED BY X-RADIOSCOPY. THE PRESENT RADIOSCOPIC METHOD IS EMBODIED IN THE AUTOMATIC FUZE INSPECTION BY RADIOGRAPHY SYSTEM (AFIRS), WHICH USES FEATURE RECOGNITION TECHNIQUES TO DETECT FUZE MISASSEMBLY FLAWS. THE REFERENCE PATTERNS FOR THE FEATURE RECOGNITION PROCESSOR COMPRISE ACTUAL RADIOSCOPIC IMAGES OF PROPERLY AND IMPROPERLY ASSEMBLED FUZES. STATISTICAL INFORMATION IS CALCULATED FROM THE IMAGES AND USED IN THE PROCESS. THE DATABASE IS DIFFICULT TO COMPILE SINCE FLAWS MUST BE HAND-FABRICATED INTO FUZES. THIS PROPOSAL IDENTIFIES THIS PROBLEM AND OFFERS A SOLUTION IN RADIOSCOPIC IMAGE MODELING. MODELLED IMAGES INTRODUCE IMPROVED DATABASE COMPILATION SINCE THERE IS NO HAND-FABRICATION INVOLVED AND THUS THE DATABASE CAN BE LARGER AND MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FUZE COMPONENTS AND ASSOCIATED FLAWS. PHASE I WORK WILL AIM TO DEVELOP A CAD GRAPHICS FUZE DESCRIPTION WHICH ACCOMPLISHES SIMULATED INSPECTION BY INTERFACE TO SOURCE MODELING SOFTWARE, OBJECT ATTENUATION DATA, AND DETECTOR RESPONSE CHARACTERISTICS. IN PHASE II, WE WILL FURTHER DEVELOP THE RADIATION MODEL AND INTERFACE TO AFIRS TO DEMONSTRATE IMPROVED FUZE INSPECTION CAPABILITY.",

CPR TRAINING FOR FAMILIES IS CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE AVAILABLE AND WILLING TO PERFORM THIS LIFE-SAVING INTERVENTION, GIVEN CARDIAC ARREST. WE BELIEVE THAT FOR CPR TRAINING OF FAMILY MEMBERS TO HAVE A BENEFICIAL IMPACT, ALTHOUGH TRAINING MUST ADDRESS NEGATIVE FEELINGS (E. G., PATIENT DEPENDENCY AND SPOUSE RESPONSIBILITY) THAT SERVE TO DETERMINE FAMILY TRUST WHEN CPR IS LEARNED FOR USE WITH A SPECIFIC FAMILY MEMBER. A FILM OF A POST-MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION PATIENT AND HIS WIFE DEALING WITH THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND TRAINING ISSUES THAT INHIBIT THE BENEFITS OF CPR TRAINING FROM BEING REALIZED WILL BE PRODUCED. EXPERTS IN CPR TRAINING, CARDIAC PATIENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS WILL GENERATE ISSUES AND RETAINED ISSUES WILL BE SCRIPTED AND WEAVED TOGETHER TO CREATE A UNIFIED SHORT FILM.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP A HIGH-SPEED, HIGH-RESOLUTION LASER SCANNING INSTRUMENT TO MEASURE BOTH THE MASS AND THE MOLECULAR WEIGHT OF DNA SEPARATED BY GEL ELECTROPHORESIS. THE INSTRUMENT DETECTS VISIBLE FLUORESCENCE FROM A DNA- SPECIFIC DYE EXCITED BY A VISIBLE CW LASER. EXPERIMENTS WITH A SLOW-SCANNING BREADBOARD INSTRUMENT HAVE DEMONSTRATED(1) A 100X IMPROVEMENT IN SENSITIVITY OVER PRESENT PHOTOGRAPHIC METHODS, AND (2) THE POTENTIAL FOR MEASURING SAMPLE FLUORESCENCE MORE ACCURATELY BY EMPLOYING IMPROVED TECHNIQUES TO CONTROL AND CORRECT FOR VARIATION IN BACKGROUND FLUORESCENCE. THE MASS OF DNA IN A BAND IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE SUMMED FLUOREESCENCE SIGNAL. IN PHASE I, THE PRESENT BREADBOARD WILL BE MODIFIED TO SCAN100X FASTER WITH A HIGHER OUTPUT LASER IN ORDER TO SCAN A 20-CM-LONG GEL LANE IN UNDER 5 MINUTES. THE GREATER SPEED AND DATA-HANDLING CAPACITY WILL PERMIT PERFORMING THE EXTENSIVE TESTING REQUIRED TO MORE FULLY ESTABLISH INSTRUMENTAL AND ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE, AND STUDYING FURTHER SAMPLES IN SEVERAL TYPES OF GELS. AN ENGINEERING PROTOTYPE WILL BE BUILT AND EXTENSIVELY TESTED IN PHASE II THAT WILL USE A HIGHER POWER LASER, IMPROVED DATA-HANDLING TECHNIQUES, AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS TOFURTHER INCREASE MEASUREMENT SPEED AND AUTOMATION. AWARDEE'S STATEMENT OF THE POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONSOF THE RESEARCH: SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE, THE PROSPECT OF INCREASED AUTOMATION, AND LOW TO MODERATE PRICE ARE HIGHLY ATTRACTIVE FEATURES OF THE INSTRUMENT, BOTH FOR NUCLEIC ACID AND OTHER APPLICATIONS IN GEL ELECTROPHORESIS. A POTENTIALLY LARGE COMMERCIAL MARKET EXISTS FOR AN IMPROVED LASER SCANNING INSTRUMENT.",

PRECISION ALL-WEATHER AUTONOMOUS GUIDANCE IS A FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCK FOR SUCH SYSTEMS. THE PROPOSED CONCEPT SYNTHESIS STUDY WILL INVESTIGATE AN INTEGRATED VISUAL-INERTIAL GUIDANCE CONCEPT THAT COMBINES IMAGING SENSORS AND INERTIAL COMPONENTS WITH IMAGE FLOW ALGORITHMS, INFORMATION ANALYSIS ALGORITHMS AND SITUATION CONTROL GUIDANCE TECHNIQUES. ADAPTIVE MISSION MANAGEMENT METHODS BASED ON IN-FLIGHT ACQUIRED INFORMATION WILL BE A MAJOR CONSIDERATION IN AVOIDING DETERCTION AND INTERCEPTION. THE BASELINE CONCEPT HAS THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY ELEMENTS: 1. PASSIVE MILLIMETER WAVE SENSOR COMPONENTS. 2. LOW-COST INERTIAL NAVIGATION COMPONENTS. 3. BINOCULAR AND QUADROCULAR SCENE TRACKING, RANGING AND MAPPING ALGORITHMS. 4. A SPHERICAL SEA LEVEL EARTH MODEL CONTAINING LOCAL TERRAIN ELEVATION REFERENCE DATA, GRAVITY VECTOR, AND CALENDAR TIME. 5. A MULTI-PROCESSOR COMPUTER, WITH AN OBJECT-ORIENTED OPERATION SYSTEM AND REALTIME SOFTWARE FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING, NAVIGATION AND MISSION MANGEMENT. THESE ELEMENTS WILL BE INTEGRATED TO ACHIEVE ALL-WEATHER PRECISION CLOSED-LOOP TERRAIN ELEVATION TRACKING AND NAVIGATION. SIX DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM (TWELVE PARAMETER) FLIGHT TRACKING WILL BE IMPLEMENTED, I.E. THREE POSITION, THREE VELOCITIES, THREE ATTITUDE ANGLES, AND THREE ATTITUDE ANGULAR RATES. THE OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO ACHIEVE LESS THAN ONE METER POSITION ACCURACY AND LESS THAN ONE MILLIRADIAN ANGULAR ACCURACY DURING ALL CRITICAL PHASES OF THE MISSION.",

EXISTING SYSTEMS ARE BASED ON KEYWORD SEARCHING ENHANCED BY STATISTICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS WITH SOME HUMAN INTERVENTION, USUALLY IN THE DOCUMENT INDEXING PROCESS. WHILE THESE METHODS HAVE BEEN PUSHED TO ACHIEVE A REASONABLE LEVEL OF SUCCESS, RESEARCHERS HAVE VERY NEARLY REACHED THE LIMITS OF SUCH METHODS AND LABOR-INTENSIVE HUMAN INTERVENTION BECOMES LESS AND LESS FEASIBLE WITH THE GROWING INFORMATION EXPLOSION. ADVANCED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES OFFER THE BEST HOPE OF BREAKING OUT OF THESE LIMITS BECAUSE THEY WOULD BRING TO THE RETRIEVAL TASK HUMAN-LIKE UNDERSTANDING CAPABILITIES. THESE INCLUDE DISAMBIGUATION OF WORD SENSES, IDENTIFICATION OF MAJOR PARTICIPANTS IN REPORTED EVENTS, ASSIGNMENT OF TEMPORAL AND CAUSAL RELATIONS BETWEEN REPORTED EVENTS, AND IDENTIFICATION OF TOPICS AND SUBTOPICS.

HIGH ERUCIC ACID RAPESEED (HEAR) OIL IS A SOURCE OF SUITABLE LONGCHAIN FATTY ACIDS AND A MONO-ESTER VERSION OF THIS OIL IS NOW INCLUDED IN LUBRICANT SUPPLEMENTS MARKETED BY INTERNATIONAL LUBRICANTS, INC.

RAW HEAR OIL IS UNSUITABLE FOR USE AS A RAW MATERIAL FOR DERIVATIVES USED IN LUBRICANTS DUETO THE PRESENCE OF 15-25% POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACID CHAINS IN THE TRIGLYCERIDE STRUCTURE. THESE CHAINS ARE THE SOURCE OF OXIDATION AND THERMAL INSTABILITY THAT LIMITS THE USEFUL CONDITIONS OF THE OIL AND ITS DERIVATIVES. A PROCESS CALLEDTELOMERIZATION MINIMIZES THE PRESENCE OF POLYUNSATURATES IN RAPE SEED OIL THROUGH FORMATION OF DIMERS AND TRIMERS BETWEEN THE REACTIVE POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACID CHAINS.

THE SYSTEM IS BASED ON THE WELL KNOWN HOMOPOLAR GENERATOR PRINCIPLE AND FEATURES A UNIQUE VOLTAGE MULTIPLYING ARMATURE MAKING THE DESIGN SIMPLE, COMPACT, AND LIGHTWEIGHT SUCH THAT IT IS WELL SUITED FOR THE DARPA APPLICATION. THE VMHPG CONSISTS OF A THIN ROTATING DISK ARMATURE IMMERSED IN A MULTIPOLE MAGNET STRUCTURE.

THE SYSTEM IS BASED ON A SPECIFIC MINIATURE DIODE-LASER, A PIGTAIL SINGLE-MODE FILTER OPTIC CABLE AND A PHOTODIODE/AMPLIFIER RECEIVER. THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE, LINEARITY AND SENSITIVITY OF SUCH A LASER CONSTITUTES A VERY ATTRACTIVE CANDIDATE TO BE USED IN DIRECT MODULATION MODE BY RF SMALL-SIGNALS. SINCE THE MAXIMUM FREQUENCY OF THE MODULATING SIGNAL IS MODERATELY HIGH, AND SPECTRAL CHIRPING EFFECTS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR RELATIVELY SHORT LINK DISTANCES, WE EXPECT THAT NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS DUE TO DIRECT MODULATION OF THE LASER DIODE WILL NOT INFLUENCE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM. THE MAIN ADVANTAGE OF THIS CONCEPT IS ITS SIMPLICITY AND HIGH EXPECTED PERFORMANCE TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIRED SENSITIVITY AND FREQUENCY RESPONSE FOR THE APPLICATION. A PROTOTYPE UNIT WILL BE DEVELOPED AND FULLY TESTED UNDER THE PHASE I EFFORT TO DEMONSTRATE THE FUNCTIONAL CAPABILITIES OF THE PROPOSED CONCEPT.",

OUR AIM IS TO USE DISTANCE EDUCATION TECHNIQUES TO INFORM PARENTS OF THEIRRIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS CONSUMERS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION, AND TO DEVELOP A DISTANCE EDUCATION CURRICULUM (L.E.P. LEARNING TO LEARN MODULES OR LLLP) THAT ENABLES PARENTS TO TEACH THEIR KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE CHILDRENTHE SKILLS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO ACADEMIC SUCCESS. OUR CURRICULUM ALSO GIVES PARENTS WHO MAY NOT KNOW HOW TO READ THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ALONG WITH THEIR CHILDREN IN A POSITIVE AND EMPOWERING MANNER. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECT ARE: (1) TO DEVELOP THE CONTENT FOR AN INFORMATION/MOTIVATION DISTANCE EDUCATION CURRICULUM; (2) TO DEVELOP A SELF-INSTRUCTIONAL SKILL-BASED CURRICULUM AND PRODUCE PROTOTYPES FOR USE IN DISTANCE EDUCATION; (3) TO TAILOR THE DISTANCE EDUCATION PROGRAM TO NEEDS OF LEP CONSUMERS; (4) TO INSURE TEACHER INVOLVEMENT AND COLLABORATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT, EVALUATION, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF LLLP; AND (5) TO DETERMINE THE MOST APPROPRIATE DISTANCE EDUCATION MEDIUM BY COST OF PRODUCTION,PRICE TO CONSUMER, AND MEANS OF DISTRIBUTION. CONCEPTS TO BE TESTED INCLUDE: INTERACTIVE VIDEO, VIDEO, AND AN AUDIO/PRINT MIX.",

ONCE THE PRINCIPLE OF OPERATING IN RESPONSE TO A MEMORY HELD PROGRAM HAS BEEN REALIZED, ALL THESE FUNCTIONS MAY FOLLOW MERELY BY THE PROGRAMMING PROCESS. A CRITICAL COMPONENT IN THE PROOF OF CONCEPT IS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE HYDRAULIC CONTROL VALVE. FOR THIS REASON A PROTOTYPE OF THE VALVE WILL BE DETAILED DESIGNED AND FABRICATED. AN EXISTING IN-HOUSE POWER SUPPLY WILL BE EMPLOYED TO PRODUCE PRELIMINARY PERFORMANCE DATA ON THIS UNIT.",

THERE IS A NEED FOR A GLOBAL, THEORY-BASED, AND INTEGRATED APPROACH THAT CAN PRESENT AN OVERALL PERSPECTIVE WHILE ALSO PROVIDING THE NECESSARY LEVEL OF DETAIL. THIS PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON TEAM DECISION PERFORMANCE. KLEIN ASSOCIATES HAS DEVELOPED MODELS OF INDIVIDUAL AND TEAM DECISION MAKING. RECENTLY WE HAVE DERIVED A GLOBAL MODEL OF TEAM FUNCTIONING, INTEGRATING BEHAVIORAL, COMMUNICATION, AND INDIVIDUAL FACETS OF TEAM PERFORMANCE. EACH OF THESE FACETS IS ANCHORED IN A SPECIFIC SET OF PROCEDURES FOR COLLECTING DATA. WE PROPOSE TO APPLY THESE MODELS TO THE TASK OF DEVELOPING PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR TACTICAL UNITS. PHASE I WILL SYNTHESIZE AND EXPAND THE EXISTING MODELS, TO OBTAIN A THEORY SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING ARMY TACTICAL UNITS. WE WILL USE THIS MODEL TO GENERATE A SET OF PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES, AND WILL TEST THESE TECHNIQUES USING THE DATABASE AT THE NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER.",

A FULL NUCLEAR AIRBLAST APPLICATION WOULD OCCUR ON DIAMOND FORTUNE AS PHASE II. THIS RESEARCH IS INNOVATIVE IN THAT WE WILL DEVELOP INSTRUMENTATION FOR MEASUREMENT OF AIRBLAST IN UNDERGROUND CAVITY HEIGHT-OF-BURST EVENTS.

THE REMOVAL OF PYROGENS FROM WATER BY DISTILLATION IS EXPENSIVE. ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVES TO DISTILLATION REQUIRE METICULOUS MAINTENANCE, EXTENSIVE PRETREATMENT OF THE WATER, AND COSTLY (OFTEN REDUNDANT) BACKUP SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THE REMOVAL OF PYROGENS FROM SOLUTION. THESE HIGH COSTS HAVE FORCED MANY HOSPITALS TO ABANDON IN-HOUSE WATER PURIFICATIONIN FAVOR OF PREPACKAGED SOLUTIONS. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO ESTABLISH THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF A LOW-COST ELECTROCHEMICAL DEVICE FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF PYROGENS IN WATER. THE DEVICE WILL BE BASED ON A SOLID POLYMER ELECTROLYTE AND WILL GENERATE OZONEAT THE ANODE AND AN ADDITIONAL CATALYTIC OXIDANT (H2O2) AT THE CATHODE; BOTH PRODUCTS WILL BE GENERATED DIRECTLY IN THE WATER STREAM. WHEN OZONE IS USED TO TREAT WATER IN COMBINATION WITH A SUITABLE CATALYST, THE LEVEL OF ORGANIC MATERIAL IN SOLUTIONCAN BE REDUCED TO BELOW PRESENT DETECTION LIMITS, AND PYROGENS ARE DESTROYED BY THIS TREATMENT. OZONE IS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE IT DECOMPOSES RAPIDLY IN WATER TO FORM OXYGEN. SEVERAL CONVENIENT SYSTEMS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE REMOVAL OF ANY EXCESS H2O2 FROM THE WATER; THUS, NO HARMFUL OXIDANT WILL REMAIN.",

ONE OF THE MAIN BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTING AOPS HAS BEEN THE HIGH CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS FOR OZONE GENERATION. LYNNTECH, INC., HAS DEVELOPED AN ELECTROCHEMICAL DEVICE FOR THE PAIRED SYNTHESIS OF OZONE AND HYDROGEN PEROXIDE FROM WATER AND OXYGEN IN A PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE-BASED ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL. THIS PROCESS FOR GENERATING OXIDANTS ELECTROCHEMICALLY CAN ELIMINATE MANY OF THE PROBLEMS IN MAKING AOPS COMMERCIALLY ATTRACTIVE. THE ADVANTAGES OF PAIRED ELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTHESIS OF O3 AND H2O2 IN ELECTROLYTE-FREE WATER INCLUDE; (A) LOWER OPERATING COSTS, AS TWO OXIDIZING AGENTS CAN BE OBTAINED FOR THE PRICE OF ONE; (B) LOWER INITIAL CAPITAL COSTS OF OZONE GENERATION; (C) THE ELIMINATION OF THE NEED FOR TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF OXIDANTS BY GENERATING THEM ELECTROCHEMICALLY WITHIN WATER ON DEMAND AT AN AMOUNT THAT IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE WASTE CONCENTRATIONS, AND (D) THE PROCESS CAN GENERATE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AQUEOUS PHASE OZONE CONCENTRATIONS THAN CAN BE OBTAINED USING TRADITIONAL METHODS OF OZONE FORMATION. RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPMENT OF A LABORATORY TEST SYSTEM FOR WATER TREATMENT INCORPORATING THE ELECTROCHEMICAL DEVICE AND A UV-LIGHT REACTOR.

THIS PROJECT EXPLORES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPOSITE COATING WHERE AN INTERMEDIATE NITI LAYER IS INTERPOSED BETWEEN THE TITANIUM ALLOY AND THE NICOCRAIY OVERLAY. THE DUCTILE NITI LAYER CAN ACCOMMODATE INTERFACIALSTRESSES GENERATED DUE TO THE THERMAL EXPANSION MISMATCH BETWEEN THE BASE MATERIAL AND THE PROTECTIVE COATING. IN ADDITION TO NITI BEING COMPATIBLE WITH TITANIUM, IT IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE NICOCRAIY LAYER AS WELL. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS COMPOSITE COATING APPROACH WILL RESULT IN A RATHER QUICK AND EASY ADAPTATION OF THE WELL-EXAMINED AND APPLIED NICOCRAIY COATING TO TITANIUM ALLOYS, THUS ENHANCING THEIR CAPABILITY FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCEGAS TURBINE APPLICATIONS.",

PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO DEVELOP A STABLE CATALYST SUPPORT USING A THREE-PRONGED APPROACH. FIRST, THREE ALTERNATIVE CATALYST SUPPORTS ARE BEING DEVELOPED: (1) GRAPHITIZED CARBON (N774, SHAWINIGAN BLACK, AND CARBON 60, THE FIRST TWO OF WHICH HAVE SHOWN DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED STABILITY); (2) MANGANESE DIOXIDE, WHICH IS AN EXCELLENT CATALYST FOR OXYGEN REDUCTION; AND (3) LANTHANUM NICKELATE, WHICH ALSO SHOWS PROMISE AS BOTH A CATALYST AND A SUBSTRATE. SECOND, IMPROVED CATALYSTS FOR THE SUBSTRATES, WHICH LOWER THE OVERPOTENTIAL FOR OXYGEN EVOLUTION ARE BEING DEVELOPED, SPECIFICALLY COBALT TETRAMETHOXY PHENYL PORPHYRIN, MANGANESE DIOXIDE, NICKEL-COBALT SPINEL, AND A VERY PROMISING PEROVSKITE. THIRD, THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE, CURRENT DENSITY, AND ELECTROLYTE CONCENTRATION ON LIFETIME ARE BEING QUANTIFIED TO COMPARE REAL-TIME ELECTRODE LIFETIMES UNDER NORMAL STRESSWITH THOSE UNDER ACCELERATED STRESS CONDITIONS.",

MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH, INC. (MTR) HAS BEEN DEVELOPING MEMBRANE-BASED CFC/AIR SEPARATION SYSTEMS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND HAS INSTALLED A NUMBER OF SMALL COMMERCIAL UNITS. THESE UNITS ARE ABLE TO REMOVE 98-99% OF CFC VAPORS FROM EFFLUENT AIR STREAMS, PRODUCING A CONCENTRATED CFC-CONTAINING PERMEATE STREAM THAT CAN BE RECYCLED. MTR BELIEVES THAT MEMBRANE-BASED SOLVENT RECOVERY UNITS OF THIS TYPE WOULD FORM AN IDEAL BASIS FOR THE ENVIRONMENTALLY ACCEPTABLE SYSTEMS THAT DOD REQUIRES. MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY HAS MANY COMPELLING ADVANTAGES OVER CARBON ADSORPTION OR CRYOGENIC RECOVERY. IN THE PHASE I PORTION OF THIS PROGRAM, MTR PROPOSES TO SELECT AN EXISTING SPRAY BOOTH/VAPOR DEGREASER SYSTEM THAT CAN BE MODIFIED TO ACCEPT A TAILOR-MADE MEMBRANE SOLVENT RECOVERY AND RECYCLE SYSTEM. A COMPLETE DESIGN FOR THIS UNIT INCLUDING APPROPRIATE EMISSIONS MONITORING INSTRUMENTATION WILL BE PREPARED. IN THE PHASE II PROGRAM, THE COMPLETE UNIT WOULD BE CONSTRUCTED AND EVALUATED, FIRST IN THE LABORATORY AND LATER AT A DOD SITE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT UP TO 300,000 TONS OF SOLVENT ARE EMITTED BY SOLVENT-CLEANING OPERATIONS ANNUALLY. A SPRAY BOOTH FITTED WITH MEMBRANE SYSTEMS TO ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATE SOLVENT EMISSIONS AND RECOVER THE SOLVENT FOR REUSE WOULD FIND NUMEROUS APPLICATIONS THROUGHOUT THE AEROSPACE, ELECTRONICS, PHARMACEUTICAL, AND OTHER \"HIGH-TECH\" INDUSTRIES.",

THE LASER SHEET MEASUREMENTS WOULD PROVIDE QUALITATIVE AND IN SOME CASES, QUANTITATIVE COMPARISONS OF THE DROPLET DISTRIBUTION ANYWHERE IN THE DUCT, AND WOULD ALSO INDICATE THE MOST STRATGEGIC LOCATIONS TO PLACE THE PARTICLE SIZING PROBE.

OPTICALLY SMART SURFACES ARE SURFACES WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED WITH SPECIALLY CHOSEN DIFFRACTION PROPERTIES WHICH ALLOW THEM TO AUGMENT THE MEASUREMENT OF PROPERTIES OF THE SURFACE OR OF THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND THE SURFACE. AN OPTICALLY SMART SURFACE IS DESIGNED TO RECEIVE A BEAM OF LIGHT FROM A TRANSMITTER, TO IMPRESS IUFORMATION OF INTEREST UPON THE LIGHT BEAM, AND THEN TO RETURN IT TO A RECEIVER WHICH EXTRACTS THE INFORMATION. POSSIBLE MEASUREMENTS INCLUDE VELOCITY OF GAS OVER THE SURFACE, TEMPERATURE, MODEL DETECTION, PRESSURE, FLOW PROPERTIES, SKIN FRICTION, AND OTHERS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH HAS THREE MAJOR DIVISIONS. THE FIRST SHOWS HOW THE DIFFRACTION PROPERTIES OF WIND TUNNEL WALLS OR MODELS CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH AERODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF INTEREST IN WIND TUNNELS. THE SECOND SHOWS HOW THE SURFACE CAN BE ADDRESSED BY AN ILLUMINATING BEAM AND TRANSFER DESIRED INFORMATION AND CARRY IT TO A RECEIVER. THE THIRD WILL DETERMINE HOW TO PHYSICALLY PRODUCE THE DESIRED SURFACES ON WIND TUNNEL OR MODEL SURFACES TO SURVIVE THE TESTS. THE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES OF BINARY AND HOLOGRAPHIC OPTICS MAKE OPTICALLY SMART SURFACES POSSIBLE. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS RESEARCH WILL LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR A NEW CLASS OF INSTRUMENTATION FOR WIND TUNNEL TESTING.",

IN RECENT YEARS, 16 PEPTIDE SEQUENCES WITH NUCLEAR TARGETING PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. THREE OF THESE PEPTIDES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED AND CONJUGATED TO ANTISENSE OLIGODEOXYNUCLEOTIDES THAT INTERFERE WITH SURFACE ANTIGEN PRODUCTION IN HEPATITIS B VIRUS. EACH PEPTIDE-OLIGONUCLEOTIDE CONJUGATE WILL BE LABELED WITH RADIOACTIVE PHOSPHORUS AND TESTED FOR ITS ABILITY TO LOCALIZE TO THE NUCLEUS IN A CELL-FREE PREPARATION OF RAT LIVER NUCLEI. UNMODIFIED OLIGONUCLEOTIDES OF VARIOUS LENGTHS WILL ALSO BE RADIOLABELED, AND THEIR RATE OF NUCLEARUPTAKE/DIFFUSION WILL BE EVALUATED. THE PEPTIDE-OLIGONUCLEOTIDE CONJUGATES WILL ALSO BE EXAMINED FOR IMPROVED ANTISENSE EFFECT IN HEPATITIS B-INFECTED (HEP3B) CELLS. THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL CONSTITUTE A FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PEPTIDE-OLIGONUCLEOTIDE CONJUGATES THAT COULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THE THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT OF DISEASESCAUSED BY INFECTION WITH HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, HEPATITIS B, HERPES VIRUSES, OR OTHER VIRUSES.",

IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT CURRENTS OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIAMPS CAN BE INDUCED IN A STANDING HUMAN EXPOSED TO VERTICALLY-POLARIZED RF ELECTRIC FIELDS AT A LEVEL OF 1 MW/CM2 IN THE FREQUENCY RANGE OF TENS OF MHZ. LARGE CURRENTS CAN ALSO BE INDUCED WHEN A HUMAN COMES IN CONTACT WITH AN UNGROUNDED METALLIC OBJECT LOCATED IN SUCH AN RF FIELD. THE MONITOR PROPOSED FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO BE USED IN EITHER A RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT OR IN ROUTINE WORK ENVIRONMENTS TO WARN OF HAZARDOUS CURRENT LEVELS AND TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH SAFETY REGULATIONS. THE MONITOR CAN BE WORN AROUND THE ANKLE OR OTHER PART OF THE BODY TO CONTINUOUSLY MEASURE INDUCED CURRENT LEVELS. THE MONITOR IS DESIGNED TO OPERATE OVER A FREQUENCY RANGE OF 10 KHZ TO 100 MHZ AND TO SENSE CURRENT LEVELS FROM 1 MA TO 1 A. DURING PHASE I, WE WILL DESIGN, FABRICATE, AND TEST A PROTOTYPE VERSION OF THE CURRENT MONITOR IN OUR LABORATORY. DURING THE TESTS, THE PROTOTYPE WILL BE OPTIMIZED TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM BANDWIDTH AND SENSITIVITY. THE RESULTS OF THE LABORATORY TESTS WILL BE USED TO DESIGN A COMPLETE, FIELDABLE VERSION OF THE CURRENT MONITOR, WHICH WILL BE DEVELOPED AND TESTED DURING PHASE II. THIS MONITOR CAN BE CONFIGURED TO PROVIDE A VARIETY OF INFORMATION, E.G., AN AUDIBLE WARNING WHEN A THRESHOLD LEVEL IS EXCEEDED AND A MEASURE OF THE AVERAGE AND PEAK CURRENT LEVELS DETECTED OVER A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME.",

THE TECHNIQUE, CALLED HETERODYNE (OR HOMODYNE) SIDEBAND INTERFEROMETRY (HSI), IS HIGHLY NONPERTURBING BECAUSE ONLY A LASER BEAM INTERACTS WITH THE ELECTRON BEAM. BOTH THE AMPLITUDE AND THE PHASE OF RF FOURIER COMPONENTS OF ELECTRON DENSITY CAN BE MEASURED. RF PHASE-MODULATION SIDEBANDS ARE INDUCED ON THE LASER BEAM BY THE ELECTRON BUNCHES. THE SIGNALS ARE DOWNSHIFTED TO DIGITIZER BANDWIDTHS BY OPTICAL HETERODYNE (OR HOMODYNE). THE TECHNIQUE ACHIEVES HIGH SENSITIVITY IN THAT ITS NOISE BANDWIDTH IS THAT OF THE PULSE ENVELOPE, RATHER THAN THE RF BANDWIDTH, AND BECAUSE AN INTERFEROMETER IS USED TO FILTER OUT THE CARRIER POWER, WHICH CAN THEN BE RAISED TO HIGH LEVELS WITH CORRESPONDINGLY HIGHER SENSITIVITY. ANOTHER ADVANTAGE IS THAT, UNLIKE OTHER ELECTRON INDEX-OF-REFRACTIONMEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES, THE DEVICE BEING MEASURED IS NOT PLACED INSIDE THE INTERFEROMETER, OFTEN AN IMPOSING PRACTICAL LIMITATION. IN PHASE I, OPTIMUM METHODS OF DATA ANALYSIS ARE BEING DETERMINED, MEANS OF ACCESSING THE ELECTRON BEAM IN VARIOUS RF SOURCES TARGETED FOR PHASE II MEASUREMENT DEMONSTRATIONS ARE BEING IDENTIFIED, AND A COMPLETE HSI ELECTRON BUNCHING MEASUREMENT SYSTEM IS BEING DESIGNED.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A RESEARCH PROGRAM TO ANALYZE AND TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A NEW TECHNIQUE TO SHARPEN THE BEAM PULSE RISE TIME OF THE AURORA FLASH GAMMA RAY SIMULATOR IS PROPOSED. THIS TECHNIQUE EMPLOYS THE INDUCTIVE EROSION PHENOMENA TO ERODE THE CURRENT RISE TIME OF THE AURORA BEAM PULSE, BY PROPAGATING IT THROUGH A PRE-IONIZED PLASMA CHANNEL ALONG THE AXIS OF THE EXISTING AURORA DRIFT TUBE. INDUCTIVE EROSION IS AN EXPERIMENTALLY VERIFIED PHYSICAL MECHANISM IN WHICH THE BEAM FRONT, IN EXPELLING THE CHANNEL ELECTRONS TO ESTABLISH CHARGE NEUTRAILITY, CONTINUALLY LOSES KINETIC ENERGY AND ERODES AWAY. SINCE THE CHARACTERISTIC TIME SCALE IS THE ACTUAL TIME TO EXPEL THE CHANNEL ELECTRONS TO THE DRIFT TUBE WALL, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE RESULTING FINAL BEAM RISE TIME WILL BE ABOUT 2 NANOSECONDS. IN FACT, SUBSTANTIAL RISE TIME REDUCTIONS DUE TO THIS MECHANISM HAVE BEEN CONCLUSIVELY OBSERVED IN MODERATE CURRENT ( KA) PRE-IONIZED CHANNEL EXPERIMENTS. FURTHER, THIS MECHANISM IS ALSO SUSPECTED TO BE THE DOMINANT EROSION MECHANISM IN THE RECENT AURORA LOW PRESSURE NEUTRAL GAS CELL TECHNIQUE IN WHICH THE CHARACTERISTIC TIME SCALE IS THE CHANNEL ELECTRON EXPULSION TIME PLUS THE BEAM-INDUCED IONIZATION TIME ( NS). THUS, BY PREFORMING THE PLASMA CHANNEL, SUBSTANTIAL RISE TIME ENHANCEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED IN ABOUT 3 METERS OF PROPAGATION, ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY CALCULATIONS. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PHASE I PROGRAM ARE TO PERFORM AN AURORA FEASIBILITY STUDY, TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL HARDWARE COMPONENTS FOR A SCALED EXPERIMENT ON AN ALTERNATIVE HDL FACILITY (E.G., TEMPO) THAT CAN BE PERFORMED IN THE EARLY PART OF PHASE II, AND TO ESTABLISH EXPERIMENTAL PARAMETERS FOR A PRELIMINARY HARDWARE DESIGN THAT COULD BE TESTED ON AURORA IN THE LATER PART OF PHASE II PROGRAM.",

WHILE BR PARTICIPATES IN PHOTON DRIVEN PROTON PUMPING, PHYCOBILIPROTEINS FORM PART OF THE PHOTON HARVESTING ASSEMBLIES IN CERTAIN ALGAE. THE PHOTODYNAMIC RESPONSE OF THE CROMOPHORE IN BR IS REASONABLY WELL UNDERSTOOD. THE RESPONSE OF THE TETRAPYRROLE CHROMOPHORE IN THE PHYCOBILIPROTEINS NEEDS TO BE CLEARLY ESTABLISHED. AS PHOTOINDUCED (IN THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM) STRUCTURAL AND ELECTRONIC CHANGES OCCUR IN THIS CHROMOPHORE, THE CHARACTERISTIC ELECTRONIC RESPONSE MAY BE UTILIZED TO DESIGN A PHOTORESPONSE CORRESPONDING TO THE INCIDENT SPECTRUM. IT IS PROPOSED THAT TWO-DIMENSIONAL LATTICES OF AT LEAST ONE OF THESE PHOTODYNAMIC PROTEINS BE PREPARED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTING MOLECULAR MEDIUM. IT IS DESIRED THAT THE ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE OF THE DYNAMIC PHOTORESPONSE OF THE PROTEIN BE RECORDED VIA THE CONDUCTING SEGMENT.

THE NAD-DEPENDENT DEHYDROGENASES CONSTITUTE THE LARGEST GROUP OF REDOX ENZYMES KNOWN TODAY. BY USING THIS METHOD OF FACILITATING ELECTRON TRANSFER FROM THE ENZYME TO THE ELECTRODE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP AMPEROMETRIC BIOSENSORS FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF CLINICALLY AND INDUSTRIALLYIMPORTANT MOLECULES. THESE SENSORS SHOULD BE HIGHLY STABLE IN BOTH CONTINUOUS OPERATION AND MULTIPLE-USE APPLICATIONS. THE PHASE I WORK FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING ELECTRODES TO DETECT GLUCOSE AND ETHANOL, BASED ON THE ENZYMES GLUCOSE DEHYDROGENASE AND ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE, RESPECTIVELY; THE PHASE II WORK WILL INCORPORATE OTHER NAD-DEPENDENT ENZYMES INTO THE SENSORS. THESE BIOSENSORS HAVE WIDESPREAD TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS IN AREAS SUCH AS THE CLINICAL LABORATORY, VETERINARY HEALTH CARE, AND THE FOOD INDUSTRY.",

GPS IS THE BEST SOLUTION FOR SPACE POSITION DATA ACQUISITION OVER ALL OTHER NAVAID SYSTEMS BECAUSE IT IS OPERATIONAL WORLDWIDE, PROVIDES BETTER PRECISION, IS INDEPENDENT OF STATIONS OPERATED BY OTHER GOVERNMENTS, AND IS FREE OF INTERFERENCE FROM ATMOSPHERICS, ETC. NAVSYS CORPORATION HAS A PROPRIETARY DESIGN FOR A LOW-COST GPS SENSOR SUITABLE FOR RAWINSONDE APPLICATION. THIS SENSOR (TIDGET), WAS DEVELOPED WITH IN-HOUSE FUNDS FOR LOW-COST TRACKING APPLICATIONS AND CAN BE PACKAGED IN THE CURRENT MSS RADIOSONDE HOUSING. WITH THE TIDGET, THE GPS C/A CODE-PHASE IS MEASURED AND RELAYED TO THE MSS TO COMPUTE POSITION USING DATA FROM A GPS REFERENCE RECEIVER. OTHER DATA, THAT IS, PRESSURE, TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, AND WINDS WOULD BE PROCESSED IN THE NORMAL MANNER. UPPER ATMOSPHERIC OBSERVATIONS ARE REQUIRED WORLDWIDE IN SUPPORT OF TOTAL DOD REQUIREMENTS. CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO SYSTEM THAT WILL SUPPORT THE REQUIREMENTS OF GLOBAL COVERAGE, SILENT OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS, PRECISION, AND SIMPLICITY OF GROUND STATION EQUIPMENT. A GPS OPERATIONAL RAWINSONDE SYSTEM WOULD SATISFY TOTAL DOD REQUIREMENTS FROM MISSILE RANGE OPERATIONS TO BATTLEFIELD DEPLOYMENT. SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD ALSO SATISFY THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE REQUIREMENTS FOR A COMPACT AUTOMATED SYSTEM TO SUPPORT THEIR OPERATIONS AT 100 UPPER AIR STATIONS. TOTAL U.S. RADIOSONDE REQUIREMENTS IS OVER 100,000 ANNUALLY. THIS QUANTITY SUPPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RELATIVELY LOW-COST GPS-TYPE RAWINSONDE SYSTEM.",

THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY CAN BE ADAPTED TO SPECIFIC MEDICAL OR INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS WHICH MAY HAVE DIFFERENT REQUIREDCHARACTERISTICS. THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION CAN BE IN THE RANGEOF 5 TO 20 LINE PAIRS PER MM. A SINGLE UNIT HAS AN ACTIVE IMAGING AREA OF 10 CM X 10 CM. BECAUSE THERE IS ESSENTIALLYNO DEAD SPACE AROUND THE EDGE OF A UNIT, SEVERAL UNITS CAN BE CLOSE PACKED TO PROVIDE VERY LARGE FORMAT REAL-TIME IMAGING. THE X-RAY CONVERSION, LIGHT PRODUCTION, AND PHOTO-ELECTRIC CONVERSION EFFICIENCIES CAN PROVIDE ABOUT ONEELECTRON PER CONVERTED X-RAY. THIS FEATURE GUARANTEES EFFECTIVE IMAGING AT MINIMAL RADIATION DOSE EXPOSURE. IN PHASE 1, WE PROPOSE DESIGNING, BUILDING, AND TESTING A SECTION OF AN IMAGING UNIT. MEASUREMENTS WILL INCLUDE SPATIAL RESOLUTION, DYNAMIC RANGE, NOISE, DETECTIVE QUANTUM EFFICIENCY, AND CONTRAST DETAIL CURVES. RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED WITH THOSE OBTAINED FROM STANDARD X-RAY IMAGING MODALITIES. THE FEASIBILITY OF THE NOVEL TECHNOLOGY WILL THEREFORE BE FULLY EXPLORED.

WORK AT LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT ZINC OXIDE VARISTORS CAN BEUSED TO CONTROL THE VOLTAGE VARIATIONS ON AN INDUCTION ACCELERATOR CELL. MEASUREMENTS ARE BEING MADE ON VARISTORS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THEIR LIFE AND TO PERFORM CIRCUIT SIMULATION STUDIES IN ORDER TO DEVELOP TECHNIQUES THAT CAN IMPROVE THE FIELD PENETRATION OF VARISTORS ON FAST TIME SCALES. A NOVEL VACUUM TUBE REGULATION TECHNIQUE IS ALSO PLANNED THAT MINIMIZES OR ELIMINATES UNDESIRABLE VOLTAGE FLUCTUATIONS CAUSED BY CURRENT FLUCTUATIONS. THIS TETRODE TECHNIQUE CAN ALSO BE USED FOR ZERO-ORDER SWITCHING OF THE PULSE POWER SYSTEM AND FOR FINE CONTROL OF THE VOLTAGE. NUMERICAL ELECTRON OPTICS STUDIES OF THIS TECHNIQUE ARE BEING PERFORMED DURING PHASE I, LEADING TO A DETAILED DESIGN OF A PHASE II EXPERIMENT. IF SUCCESSFUL, A COST-EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO THE LONGITUDINAL INSTABILITY WILLRESULT FROM THIS WORK.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         SPREAD SPECTRUM TECHNIQUES ARE WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED TO PROVIDE LOW PROBABILITY OF INTERCEPT (LPI) CAPABILITY. CONVENTIONAL DIRECT SEQUENCE SPREADING, HOWEVER, SUFFERS FROM THE SHORTCOMING THAT AN INTERCEPTOR REQUIRES ONLY VERY SIMPLE PROCESSING TO COLLASPE THE SPREAD SIGNAL TO A NEADILY DETECTABLE UNMODULATED SIMUSOID. FURTHERMORE, HIGH LEVELS OF LPI ARE ONLY ACHIEVED BY USING HIGH SPEED GENERATORS FOR THE SPREADING SIGNALS, NECESSITATING COMPLEX SYNCHRONIZATION ALGORITHMS. THE APPROACH DESCRIBED HERE ELIMINATES THESE UNDERSIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS BY REPLACING THE SINUSOIDAL CARRIER WITH A PURE NOISE WAVEFORM. THIS PREVENTS AN INTERCEPTOR FROM USING NON-LINEAR TECHNIQUES TO EXPLOIT SOME DETERMINISTIC ELEMENT OF THE SIGNAL BECAUSE THERE ARE NONE TO EXPLOIT. IN ADDITION, SINCE THE SPECTRAL SPREADING IS NOT A FUNCTION OF THE RATE AT WHICH THE TRANSEC GENERATOR IS CLOCKED, VERY SLOWLY CHANGING (OR FIXED) TRANSEC CAN BE USED, THEREBY GREATLY SIMPLIFYING (OR ELIMINATING) THE SYNCHRONIZATION PROCESS. THE OBJECT OF THIS EFFORT IS TO INVESTIGATE THIS BASIC CONCEPT, DETERMINE THE LPI PERFORMANCE ACHIEVED FOR A WIDE RANGE OF DESIGN PARAMETERS, AND DEVELOP A BREADBOARD FOR EVALUATION. THE METHODOLOGY MAKES EXTENSIVE USE OF COMPUTER SIMULATION TO PROVIDE BOTH QUALITATIVE INSIGHT AND A QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF THE TECHNIQUE'S PERFORMANCE.",

QUANTIFYING THIS VERTICAL FLUX OF PARTICULATE CARBON IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL FOR PREDICTING THECONSEQUENCES OF CONTINUED CO2 EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, TRADITIONAL METHODS BASED ON SEDIMENT TRAPS ARE PRONE TO ERROR BECAUSE OF HYDRODYNAMIC EFFECTS ON COLLECTOR EFFICIENCY AND COMPROMISE OF COLLECTED SAMPLES BY BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY. THE AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP FIBER OPTIC SPARSE-PIXEL MULTI-APERTURE SENSORS (MAS) CAPABLE OF DETECTING SETTLING PARTICLES IN A REMOTE AND NONINVASIVE MANNER. MAS, BASED ON THE DESIGN OF THE INSECT EYE, ARE FAR LESS DATA INTENSIVE THAN CONVENTIONAL IMAGING SYSTEMS SUCH AS VIDEO CAMERAS. MAS, WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED FOR WEAPONS SYSTEMS, ARE HIGHLY REDUNDANT AND CAN TOLERATE THE LOSS OF SENSING ELEMENTS, BIOFOULING OF OPTICAL SURFACES, AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSES ASSOCIATED WITH OCEAN DEPLOYMENT. THE FIBER OPTIC COMPONENTS ARE SMALL, EASILY CONFIGURED SO AS NOT DISTURB THE SENSED VOLUME OF WATER, AND INEXPENSIVE. IN PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT, A LABORATORY PROTOTYPE MAS IS BEING DEVELOPED.

THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO FIND NOVEL, CELL-PERMEABLE ACTIVATORS OF THESE KINASES FOR EVALUATION AS CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING DRUGS. PHASE I EFFORTS WILL DEVELOP SUBSTRATES, ASSAYS, AND A PURIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE AMP-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE. TESTING OF AMP ANALOGS AND PURIFICATION OF THE SECOND KINASE WILL ALSO BE INITIATED.

        "abstract": "Abstract         A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN IMPLEMENTING OPTICAL INTERCONNECTS IS THE INHERENT ATTENUATION CAUSED BY THE SPLITTING AND COMBINING OF OPTICAL SIGNALS. ACTIVE INTERCONNECTS USING SEMICONDUCTOR OPTICAL AMPLIFIERS (SOAS) SHOW GREATPROMISE FOR OVERCOMING THOSE INHERENT LOSSES, AND FOR IMPROVING INTERCONNECT SPEEDS FROM MEMORY, PROCESSORS AND DISPLAYS IN DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, THESE DEVICES ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED BY INADEQUATE TECHNIQUES FOR INTERFACING THE DEVICES TO OPTICAL FIBER. OPTIVISION PROPOSES A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH FOR INTERFACING ACTIVE OPTICAL INTERCONNECTS WITH SOAS, BASED ON (1) APPLICATION-DRIVEN INTERFACE PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS, (2) A THEORETICAL ANALYUSIS OF OPTICAL MODE MATCHING AND ALIGNMENT TOLERANCES, (3) SOA DEVICE MODELLING, TEST, EVALUATION, AND DESIGN, AND (4) PACKAGING DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION. THE APPROACH STRESSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FLEXIBLE PACKAGE DESIGN WHICH CAN BE APPLIED TO A WIDE VARIETY OF PROTOTYPE DEVICES AND CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AT THE PHOTONICS LABORATORY WITH RELATIVELY LOW CAPITAL COSTS. OPTIVISION'S PREVIOUS ROLE IN MODELING, TEST, AND EVALUATION OF SOA INTERCONNECT DEVICES AT THE PHOTONICS LABORATORY, AND ITS ABILITY TO WORK WITH A NUMBER OF DEVICE MANUFACTURERS AND PACKAGING VENDORS ENABLES US TO EVOLVE AN ECLECTIC SOLUTION WHICH IS NOT CONSTRAINED BY ANY ONE PROPRIETARY DEVICE DESIGN OR PACKAGING TECHNIQUE.",

THE NETWORK PROVIDES GREATLY ENHANCED PERFORMANCE IN DISTRIBUTEDWORKSTATION COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS, WHILE RETAINING THE GENERAL FEATURES AND CAPABILITIES OF STANDARD COMPUTER BACKPLANE BUSES SUCH AS VMEBUS. A BUS EXTENDER COPIES THE INSTANTANEOUS STATE OF THE BACKPLANE BUS IN ONE WORKSTATION TO A BUS IN ANOTHER WORKSTATION. BY COMBINING THE BUS EXTENDER WITH AN INTELLIGENT CROSSBAR (HAVING A FIFO BUFFER,DESTINATION ROUTING, AND AN ELECTRONIC CROSSBAR SWITCHING MATRIX), THE IBECN CAN TRANSFER DATA BETWEEN MANY PAIRS OF BACKPLANES AT THE FULL BUS BANDWIDTH OVER AN INTERCONNECTIONDISTANCE OF 2 KM. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM AIMS AT A PERFORMANCELEVEL (200 MBITS/S) THAT IS MUCH BETTER THAN LANS, YET MUCH CHEAPER THAN GIGABIT OPTICAL NETWORKS. IN THIS PHASE ISBIR STUDY, WE WILL EXTEND BACKPLANE PROTOCOLS TO WORK WITH THE NETWORK, DEVELOP OPERATIONAL SPECIFICATIONS, COMPLETE A HIGH LEVEL DESIGN, HARDWARE DESIGN AND SOFTWARE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN, ANALYZE THE PERFORMANCE AND SIMULATE THE IBECN. FINALLY WE WILL GENERALIZE THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES TO OTHER STANDARD BACKPLANE BUSSES SUCH AS MULTIBUS II, NUBUS, FUTUREBUS, ETC. A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WILL BE DEVELOPED UNDER PHASE II.",

VERY HIGH DATA RATES, INCREASING DISTANCES BETWEEN SENSORS AND PROCESSORS, AND ISOLATION FROM ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE FAVOR FIBER OPTIC INTERCONNECTIONS. PHOTONIC SWITCHING (AS OPPOSED TO ELECTRONIC SWITCHING), WHICH MAY BE REQUIRED AT SOME THRESHOLD OF DATA RATES, IS DESIRABLE IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE EXTRA OPTICAL-TO-ELECTRONIC CONVERSION REQUIRED FOR ELECTRONIC SWITCHING. THIS PROJECT IS EXAMINING THE USE OF PHOTONIC SWITCHING FOR ROUTING SUCH DATA, ALLOWING THE COLLECTION OF ALL FRAGMENTS OF EVENTS (FROM DIFFERENT DETECTORS) AT SEPARATE PROCESSORS FOR EACH EVENT. ALTERNATIVE SWITCH ARCHITECTURES AND TECHNOLOGIES BASED ON EXPERIENCE IN PHOTONIC SWITCHING ARE BEING STUDIED AND THEY INCLUDE THE OPTICAL MATRIX-VECTOR MULTIPLIER, THE OPTICAL BARREL SHIFTER, AND A SCALABLE SWITCH DESIGN BASED ON SWITCHABLE SPLITTERS AND COMBINERS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         A PROBLEM OF INTEREST TO THE U.S. NAVY IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES TO DETECT AND CLASSIFY THREAT SOURCES OF SHORT-DURATION, ACOUSTIC TRANSIENT EVENTS IN UNDERWATER ACOUSTIC DATA. THE PROBLEM IS VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE (1) EVERY THREAT SOURCE HAS MANY CLASSES OF ASSOCIATED ACOUSTIC EVENTS, AND (2) THE UNDERWATER ENVIRONMENT HAS AN EVEN GREATER NUMBER OF INTERFERENCE ACOUSTIC EVENTS, SUCH AS THOSE FROM BIOLOGICS. ORINCON HAS FOUND THROUGH EXPERIEMENTS WITH ACTUAL TRANSIENT DATA THAT NO SINGLE SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUE CAN CREATE SUFFICIENT FEATURES TO ENABLE ONE TO DISTINGUISH UNIQUELY AMONG THE LARGE CLASSES OF TRANSIENTS. RATHER, SEVERAL TECHNIQUES ARE REQUIRED TO GENERATE METRICS FROM WHICH TRANSIENTS CAN BE CLASSIFIED. THE DATA FUSION OF THESE FEATURES IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE (1) EACH FEATURE-VERSUS-TIME PLOT FOUND FROM PROCESSING REAL DATA IS USUALLY A COMPLEX PATTERN OT THE HUMAN EYE, AND (2) THE AGGREGATE PATTERN FROM ALL THE FEATURES IS EVEN MORE COMPLEX TO PERCEIVE. THIS PROPOSAL WILL DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING A REAL-TIME MASSIVE NEURAL NETWORK WITH OVER 10,000 INPUT NODES (BEYOND CURRENT REAL-TIME NEURAL NETWORK HARDWARE TECHNOLOGY) TO PERFORM FUSING OF MULTIPLE FEATURE-VERSUS-TIME GRAMS. IN PHASE II, THE ALGORITHMIC APPROACHES DETERMINED FEASIBLE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BY EXPLOITING NEW NEURAL NETWORK HARDWARE TECHNOLOGY UNDER DEVELOPMENT BY DARPA. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - MASSIVE NEURAL NETWORK DATA FUSION OF MULTIPLE COMPLEX FEATURE EXTRACTION ALGORITHM OUTPUTS WILL SHORTEN THE CYCLE TIME TO FIELD AN OPERATIONAL TRANSIENT PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR NAVY APPLICATIONS. THE MULTIFEATURE APPROACH WILL INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF DETECION AND CORRECT CLASSIFICATION, DECREASE THE PROBABILITY OF FALSE ALARM AND MISCLASSIFICATION, AND BROADEN THE NUMBER OF CLASSES THAT CAN BE CLASSIFIED. THIS WILL SIMPLIFY THE DOWNSTREAM INFORMATION",

        "abstract": "Abstract         IDENTIFICATION OF DISTANT, PASSIVE THREATS IN A COMBAT ENGAGEMENT WHERE LARGE CLUTTERED BACKGROUNDS ARE PRESENT IS OF MAJOR CONCERN TO INFRARED SENSOR SYSTEMS. THE IDENTIFICATION OF BOTH THREAT, FRIENDLY AND NEUTRAL, TARGETS IN A CLUTTERED SCENE ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE ADDED EDGE NEEDED FOR SMART BATTLE MANAGEMENT AND SURVIVABILITY. IN MANY CASES THE DETECTION AND DECLARATION OF A DISTANT POINT CAN GIVE THE ADDED TIME TO MAKE AN INTELLIGENT RESPONSE OR NON-RESPONSE TO A SITUATION. IN THE SPACE COMBAT ENVIRONMENT THE THREATS SUCH AS AIRCRAFT, DECOYS, MISSILES, ETC., JUST TO NAME A FEW, HAVE UNIQUE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES. MEASUREMENT OF THESE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES WILL ALLOW POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE POTENTIAL OR NON-POTENTIAL THREAT. EARLY DETECTION OF THREATS USING INFRARED SENSORS IN A CLUTTERED ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES A HIGH SIGNAL TO CLUTTER NOISE RATIO, I.E., EFFECTIVE CLUTTER REJECTION. THREE GENERIC CLUTTER REJECTION TECHNIQUES THAT ARE USED ARE: (1) SPATIAL DISCRIMINATION, (2) SPECTRAL DISCRIMINATION, (3) TEMPORAL DISCRIMINATION. THE USE OF SPECTRAL ANALYSIS BESIDES BEING AN EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE FOR IDENTIFICATION OF TARGETS ALSO ENABLES DIFFERENTIATION OF TARGET FROM CLUTTER. WE PROPOSE IN THIS SBIR TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING A NEW INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUE. \"POINT MULTI-SPECTRAL SENSING\" (PMSS), FOR MEASURING THE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES OF DISTANT POINT-LIKE OBJECTS. THIS TECHNIQUE USES LIGHT WEIGHT INEXPENSIVE DIFFRACTION OPTICS, COUPLED WITH SIMPLE DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED WITH A PARALLEL PROCESSOR. THIS PROPOSED TECHNIQUE CAN IDENTIFY TARGETS AT RANGES COMPARABLE TO OR EXCEEDING THE RANGE AT WHICH THEY MAY BE DETECTED WITH MONOCHROMATIC INFRARED SURVEILLANCE AND WARNING SYSTEMS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A NEW METHOD OF FABRICATING LONG LENGTHS OF PIPE FROM EXOTIC METALS. THE METHOD IS PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE FOR METALS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH BECAUSE OF BRITTLENESS OR EXTREMELY HIGH SOFTENINGTEMPERATURES. FOR DOE, THE NEW TECHNIQUE IS TO BE APPLIED TO THE FABRICATION OF TUNGSTEN TUBING. SUCH TUBING IS NEEDED TO HANDLE CORROSIVE LIQUIDS USED DURING THE PROCESSING OF NUCLEAR FUEL FOR SEVERAL ADVANCED NUCLEAR REACTOR CONCEPTS. AT PRESENT, TUNGSTEN TUBING FOR THIS APPLICATION IS FABRICATED ONLY BY GUN DRILLING, IN WHICH A LONG DRILL BIT BORES OUT A HOLE IN A CIRCULAR BAR. GUN DRILLING, HOWEVER, LIMITS THE TUBING LENGTH TO ABOUT 8 FEET AND REQUIRES LARGER-THAN-DESIRED TUBING WALL THICKNESS. MOREOVER, GUN DRILLING CANNOT BE USED ON TUNGSTEN, THE MATERIAL OF CHOICE; A MOLYBDENUM-TUNGSTEN ALLOY IS USED INSTEAD, WITH REDUCED CORROSION RESISTANCE BEING A CONSEQUENCE. THE NEW TUBE FABRICATION TECHNIQUE IS ESPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE FOR THIS DOE APPLICATION BECAUSE IT CAN BE READILY APPLIED TO PURE TUNGSTEN, AS WELL AS TO MOLYBDENUM-TUNGSTEN ALLOY. WALL THICKNESS CAN BE REDUCED AND CONTROLLED, AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE TUBE LENGTH CAN BE MUCH GREATER THAN THE PRESENT LIMIT OF 8 FEET. ALSO, THETUBING IS FABRICATED FROM COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE STOCK MATERIAL, SO THAT THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE FINISHED PRODUCT ARE WELL CHARACTERIZED. IN PHASE I OF THE PROJECT, THE FEASIBILITY OF THE INNOVATIVE BORING TECHNIQUE APPLIED TO PURE TUNGSTEN WILL BE DEMONSTRATED, INCLUDING STRAIGHTNESS OF THE BORE, BORING RATE, AND SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS. SAMPLES WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION AT THE END OF PHASE I. PHASE II WORK WILL INVOLVE SCALE-UP OF THE PHASE I PROCESS.",

THIS DESIGN ELIMINATES THE FRICTTON, WEAR, AND SEAL LEAKAGE PROBLEMS OF CURRENT STIRLING COOLERS, AND WILL PROVIDE A HIGH RELIABILITY, LONG-LIFE REFRIGERATOR. THE USE OF NEAR AMBIENT PRESSURE AIR AS THE WORKING FLUID MAKES THIS MACHINE ENVIRONMENTALLY BENIGN AND IMMUNE TO PROBLEMS WITH LEAKAGE IN THE COOLER ENVELOPE. THE REFRIGERATOR IS AN ARRAY OF SMALL COOLING \"MODULES\" MAKING IT INSENSITIVE TO FAILURES OF ANY INDIVIDUAL MODULE. THIS DESIGN ALSO ENABLES VERY SIMPLE SCALING TO DIFFERENT COOLING CAPACITIES BY THE ADDITION OR REMOVAL OF COOLING MODULES. THE THERMODYNAMIC BASIS AND CRITICAL COMPONENT RELIABILITY FOR THIS MACHINE DESIGN HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXPERIMENTALLY DEMONSTRATED IN PREVIOUS WORK. THE FEASIBILITY DEMONSTRATION IN PHASE I WILL THEREFORE FOCUS ON SCALING AND OPTIMIZING THE THERMODYNAMICPARAMETERS AND PHYSICAL CONFIGURATION TO THIS SPECIFIC APPLICATION AND AN EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OF OUR DESIGN METHOD AT THESE CONDITIONS. THE DESIGN WILL ADDRESS COOLING PERFORMANCE, DIMENSIONS, INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS, WEIGHT, AND FABRICATION METHODOLOGY, AND WILL SETTHE STAGE FOR FABRICATION AND TESTING IN THE SECOND PHASE.",

THE HEAT PIPE DIODE CONTAINS AN INNOVATIVE MICROMACHINED WICK WHICH ENABLES HIGH CAPACITY AND A UNIQUE INTERNAL CONFIGURATION WHICH ENABLES DIODE ACTION. DIODE ACTION ENABLES A REDUNDANT CRYOCOOLER WITHOUT LARGE HEAT LEAK PENALTIES BECAUSE THE CONDUCTIVITY IN REVERSE IS LESS THAN 0.02% OF FORWARD CONDUCTIVITY. THE DIODE'S HIGH FORWARD CONDUCTIVITY REDUCES THE MASS OF A CRYOGENIC COOLING SYSTEM BY 50 KG COMPARED TO A SOLID CONDUCTOR. IN PHASE I WE HAVE DEVELOPED A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN FOR THE HEAT PIPE DIODE AND FABRICATED SAMPLES OF THE MICROMACHINED WICK.

SECOND, ANTICONVULSANT ACTIVITY OF CBZ IS UNALTERED IN THE MOUSE MES(MAXIMAL ELECTROCONVULSANT SHOCK) MODEL WHEN GIVEN IN THE AQUEOUS FORMULATION. THIRD, THE IV TOTAL DAILY DOSE OF CBZ PROJECTED TO MAINTAIN SEIZURE CONTROL CAN BE FORMULATED IN AREASONABLE VOLUME.

THE EXCIPIENT HAS A FAVORABLE TOXICITY PROFILE FOR IV DOSINGAND THE SOLUTIONS ARE STABLE TO HEAT STERILIZATION. THE STUDIES WILL EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A PARENTERAL FORMULATION OF CBZ BASED ON THIS LICENSED INCLUSION COMPLEX TECHNOLOGY. THE STUDIES WILL EXPLORE: FORMULATION STABILITY, COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER IV FLUIDS, VENOUS IRRITATION, TOXICITY PROFILES AND MANUFACTURING REPRODUCABILITY.

CARBON DIOXIDE EXHIBITS OBVIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL ADVANTAGES OF SAFETY AND ACCEPTABILITY AND ITS ABILITY TO DISSOLVE EVERY OIL THAT IS ENUMERATED IN THE TOPIC DESCRIPTION PLACES IT IN THE FOREMOST POSITION OF THE EMERGING CFCAND VOC-FREE CLEANING PROCESSES. THE PROPOSAL PRESENTS DATA ON THE SOLUBILITY OF THE OILS IN SUPER-GYROSCOPE PARTS CLEANING TESTS. THE ABILITY OF THE FLUOROCARBON/FLUOROETHER SURFACTANT TO REMOVE BOTH LOW AND HIGH DENSITY SUBMICRON PARTICULATES FROM BERYLLIUM PARTS, SILICON WAFERS, AND POLYMER SURFACES IS DETAILED, AND THE RESULTS PRESENTED POINT OUT THAT THE PHASE I TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES CAN EASILY BE MET. BECAUSE QUESTIONS OF THE ECONOMICS OF MANY NEW PROCESS ARE IMPORTANT FOR ASSESSING ITS VIABILITY RELATIVE TO COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES, THE PHASE I PROGRAM INVOLVES THE ASSESSMENT OF ECONOMICS OF A CLEANING FACILITY THAT PROCESSES PARTS OF A TYPE AND PRODUCTION RATE STIPULATED BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE CONTRACT MONITOR. THE RESULTS OF THE ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT COUPLED WITH THE ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES WILL ALSO POINT OUT THE MERITS OF A PHASE II PROGRAM. THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF PHASE I AND PHASE II EFFORTS WILL RESULT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ENVIRONMENTALLY ACCEPTALE CLEANING PROCESS TO REPLACE CFC-113 FOR APPLICATION TO PRECISION PARTS CLEANING.

WE WILL MEET THESE OBJECTIVES BY DEVELOPING A BIPOLAR, MULTIPLY CHARGED, HEAVY CLUSTER PRIMARY BEAM PROBE FOR MORE EFFICIENT SPUTTERING OF SECONDARY SAMPLE IONS. THE ADVANTAGES OF HEAVY CLUSTER BEAMS ARE MANY. BECAUSE THEY ARE MULTIPLY CHARGED WHEN FORMED, THEY ARE CAPABLE OF PROVIDING IMPACT ENERGIES UP TO L MEV USING ONLY MODERATE ACCELERATING VOLTAGE.

UNLIKE UNIPOLAR OPERATION OF MOST ION SOURCES, CLUSTERS FORMED BY ELECTROHYDRODYNAMIC (EH) IONIZATION CAN BE GENERATED EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY CHARGED.

THE RAYLEIGH AND RAMAN LIDARS ARE ALREADY OPERATIONAL IN THE GL HIGH ALTITUDE MOBILE LIDAR TRAILER. THE SODIUM FLUORESCENCE LIDAR REQUIRES THE MAJORITY OF THE INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT. INTEGRATION OF THE THREE LIDARS, BOTH IN HARDWARE AND IN DATA ANALYSIS CONSTITUTES THE REMAINDER OF THE WORK. THE FLUORESCENCE LIDAR WILL NEED A PULSED, HIGH ENERGY, NARROW BANDWIDTH, TUNABLE DYE LASER TRANSMITTER, AND A NARROW BANDWIDTH RECEIVER. THE TRANSMITTER MUST BE CAPABLE OF SELECTIVELY EXCITING DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE DOPPLER BROADENED HYPERFINE SPECTRUM OF MESOSPHERIC SODIUM. TUNING OF THE LASER WILL BE UNDER COMPUTER CONTROL, AND MUST BE RELIABLE ENOUGH FOR MANY HOURS OF UNINTERRUPTED DATA ACQUISITION. THE RECEIVER WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH A NEWLY DEVELOPED ATOMIC FILTER TO PROVIDE NARROW-BANDWIDTH, WIDE ANGULAR-ACCEPTANCE, AND HIGH QUANTUM EFFICIENCY. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PHASE I STUDY WILL LEAD DIRECTLY TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF A POWERFUL, PORTABLE, HYBRID LIDAR SYSTEM CAPABLE OF MEASURING ROUTINELY AND CONTINUOUSLY A REGION OF THE ATMOSPHERE CURRENTLY ACCESSIBLE ONLY BY ROCKETS.

CLEARLY, ARCHITECTURE DESIGN HAS OUTPACED DEVICE DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS PROPOSAL WE DESCRIBED A REVOLUTIONARY NEW DEVICE WHICH WILL MEET ALL OF THE ABOVE DEVICE REQUIREMENTS. WE CALL IT A SURFACE-EMITTING LASER LOGIC (CELL) DEVICE. THE DEVICE CONSISTS OF A VERTICAL-CAVITY SURFACE-EMITTING LASER MONOLITHICALLY INTEGRATED WITH A PHOTOTRANSISTOR. THE CELLS ARE CASCADABLE; HAVE HIGH OPTICAL GAIN (LARGE FAN OUT CAPABILITY);FUNCTION NATURALLY TO PERFORM ABOOLEAN DIGITAL OPTICAL LOGIC; CAN BE FABRICATED USING SIMPLE TWO-DIMENSIONAL PLANAR VLSI TECHNOLOGY AND EMIT LIGHT PERPENDICULAR TO THE SURFACE.

IN THE SYSTEM UNDER STUDY, THE WDM TECHNIQUE IS USED FOR PARALLEL TRANSMISSION OF DATA;EACH BIT IS ENCODED WITH A DIFFERENT WAVELENGTH AND SENT THROUGH ONE TRANSMISSION PATH (I.E., A SINGLE OPTICAL FIBER DATA LINK). TIME DIVISION MULTIPLEXING IS USED TO SEND THE DATA SERIALLY BY BYTES. WDM IS ONE OF MANY TECHNIQUES USED TO ACHIEVE HIGH DATA RATES IN OPTICAL COMMUNICATION NETWORKS. OTHER TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS TIME DIVISION AND CODE DIVISION MULTIPLEXING, ARE LIMITED BY THE SPEED OF ELECTRONIC TRANSMITTERS TO DATA RATES 1 TO 10 GBIT/SEC. THEHIGH COST OF THESE TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS PREVENTS THEIR WIDE USE IN COMPUTER COMMUNICATION. WDM SYSTEMS OFFERHIGH CONCURRENCY AND PERMIT HIGH DATA RATES WITHOUT THE USE OF HIGH SPEED ELECTRONICS. THEREFORE, THEY ARE WELL SUITED FOR USE IN COMPUTER COMMUNICATION NETWORKS. FOR EXAMPLE, A 16-BIT 100 MBIT/SEC SYSTEM CAN BE UPGRADED TO A 1.6 GBIT/SECSYSTEM USING THE WDM TECHNIQUE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION OF THE EXISTING SOFTWARE AND ELECTRONICS. WDMSARE BASED ON HIGHLY SELECTIVE WAVEGUIDE HOLOGRAMS IN SINGLE MODE, LOW LOSS GLASS WAVEGUIDES. BECAUSE OF THE LONG INTERACTION LENGTH OF WAVEGUIDE HOLOGRAMS, THE CHANNEL BANDWIDTH CAN BE <1 NM. WDMS HAVE COMPACT DIMENSIONS, ARE COMPATIBLE WITH SINGLE MODE OPTICAL FIBERS, AND HAVE HIGH OPTICAL EFFICIENCY.

IN THIS PROJECT, THE USE OF COAXIAL CAVITIES AND ANOVEL GUN CONFIGURATION ARE BEING EXPLORED FOR REALIZATION OF SUCH GYROTRONS. INITIAL CALCULATIONS SUPPORTED BY SOVIETEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS INDICATE THAT AN INNER CONDUCTOR CAN SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASE THE MODE COMPETITION IN GYROTRON CAVITIES, ALLOWING THE USE OF LARGE DIAMETERS TO REDUCE OHMIC HEATING. CALCULATIONS SHOW THAT WITH A MODE SIMILAR TO ONE USED IN THE SOVIET UNION TO PRODUCE 1 MW AT 100 GHZ WITH 35% EFFICIENCY, 1 MW AT 280 GHZ CAN BE GENERATED WITH AN OHMIC HEATING POWER LESS THAN 2.5 KW/CM(2). THIS RESULT OFFERS IMPROVEMENTS OVER OTHER DESIGNS FOR THE SAME POWER AND FREQUENCY THAT REQUIRE THE USE OF SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER ORDER MODES THAN HAVE BEEN USED TO DATE AND MAY SUFFER FROM MODE COMPETITION. IN ADDITION, THE COAXIAL CAVITY GYROTRON HAS A SMALLER DIAMETER ELECTRON GUN, WHICH RREDUCES THE COSTOF BOTH THE TUBE AND THE SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNET.

USUALLY, THE REQUESTS FOR EXPOSURE AREA ARE GREATER THAN THE AVAILABLE AREA. EXPERIMENTS INVOLVING SOFT X-RAYS HAVE TO BE PLACED IN A DIRECT LINE OF SIGHT BECAUSE SOFT X-RAYS SCATTER POORLY AND SOMETIMES HIGHER FLUENCES ARE REQUESTED THAN CAN BE PROVIDED BY SCATTERING. LARGE SCATTERS ARE AVAILABLE FOR HARDER X-RAYS WHICH UTILIZE LARGE AREA LOW-Z SCATTERS. THESE SCATTERERS EFFECTIVELY SHADOW LARGE AREAS FROM SOFT X-RAYS SO THEY REDUCE THE AREA AVAILABLE FOR SOFT X-RAY EXPERIEMENTS. WE PROPOSE TO USE THE AREA IN FRONT OF THE HARD X-RAY SCATTERER TO DEPLOY A SOFT X-RAY REFLECTOR CONCENTRATOR WHICH WILL REFLECT SOFT X-RAYS INTO AN ALCOVE FOR EXPERIMENTS. THIS REFLECTOR WILL BE ESSENTIALLY TRANSPARENT TO HARD X-RAYS WHICH WILL PASS THROUGH TO THE SCATTERER BUT WILL PROVIDE HIGH REFLECTIVITY FOR SELECTED SOFT X-RAY ENERGIES. THIS WILL ALLOW AN EXPERIMENTER TO CUSTOM TAILOR HIS SOFT X-RAY SPECTRA WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM OTHER RADIATION AND WITHOUT USING VALUABLE EXPOSURE AREA.",

CATALYTIC GLOWPLUGS OFFER THE SIMPLICITY OF A GLOWPLUG SYSTEM WITH INCREASED EFFECTIVENESS FROM CATALYTIC ACTIVITY. PRECISION COMBUSTION'S GLOWPLUGS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IGNITE ENGINE COMBUSTION AT MUCH LOWER TEMPERATURES THAN STANDARD PLUGS IN A CURRENT NASA SBIR PROGRAM FOR LOW COMPRESSION, DIESEL ROTARY ENGINES. THE LOWER TEMPERATURE OPERATION OFFERS MORE DURABILITY, OR THE PLUG CAN BE OPERATED AT AN INTERMEDIATE TEMPERATURE FOR GREATLY INCREASED EFFECTIVENESS. THUS, A GLOWPLUG CAN BE FABRICATED THAT WILL IGNITE MUCH COLDER FUEL AIR MIXTURES, AND ALLOW ENGINES TO FIRE AND START AT LOWER TEMPERATURES, AS WELL AS RUN MORE SMOOTHLY SOONER. PHASE I WILL ENTAIL PROOF OF CONCEPT TESTING WITH DEMONSTRATION OF COLD START CAPABILITIES IN A DIESEL ENGINE AT -25 F. PHASE II WILL ADAPT THE TECHNOLOGY TO A DIESEL ENGINE IN USE BY THE ARMY.",

ALL THESE PROCESSES INCORPORATE FINE TO EXTREMELY FINE GRINDING OF THE COAL TO LIBERATE MINERAL PARTICLES, PARTICULARLY PYRITE, FROM THE COAL'S MATRIX PRIOR TO SEPARATION. ONE OF THE PROCESSES, THE HEAVY-LIQUID-CYCLONING TECHNOLOGY, PROVED VERY EFFICIENT AT PYRITIC SULFUR AND ASH REMOVAL (80% - 95%) DURING PRELIMINARY DEMONSTRATION SCALE TESTING. HOWEVER, A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL SHORTCOMINGS NEED TO BE OVERCOME THROUGH FUTURERESEARCH BEFORE THE TECHNOLOGY IS READY FOR COMMERCIALIZATION. THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF SUBSTITUTING A NOVEL CENTRIFUGE SEPARATOR, DESIGNED BY PTI AND DOE STAFF, FOR HYDROCYCLONES IN THE HEAVY-LIQUID CLEANING PROCESS. THE CENTRIFUGE IS DESIGNED TO OVERCOME CERTAIN LIMITATIONS OF CYCLONE CLEANING, NAMELY THE INABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY CLEAN THE EXTREMELY FINE SIZES (-325M) OR OPERATE IN HIGHLY VISCOUS LIQUID MEDIAS. THE PROTOTYPE CENTRIFUGE SEPARATOR WILL BE EVALUATED BASED ON SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARATIVE TESTING WITH CONVENTIONAL CYCLONES USING VARIOUS COAL FEEDS AND HEAVY-LIQUID MEDIAS.",

A 550 KNOT TARGET TROLLEY MAY BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF TWO RECENT TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS. THE FIRST OF THESE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH STRENGTH, LOW WEIGHT ARAMID FIBER CABLE. THE SECOND IS THE RECENT CONCEPTION OF A NEW CAPSTAN PRINCIPLE BASED ON BI-HELICAL CAMMING. TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL OF THIS RELATIONSHIP EMPIRICAL CALCULATIONS, FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS AND CRITICAL ITEM TESTING WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE AN OPTIMIZED TROLLEY DRIVE. THE UNIQUE APPLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF FORCE BY THE CAPSTAN DRIVE TO THE AERIAL CABLE WOULD PERMIT CONTROLLED ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION OF THE TROLLEY. THE SIZE AND WEIGHT OF THE PROPOSED TROLLEY WOULD BE MINIMAL AS COMPARED TO THE PAYLOAD. IT IS BELIEVED THAT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CABLE ABRASION WILL BE VIRTUALLY ELIMINATED SINCE THIS NEW CAPSTAN DRIVE HAS NO CABLE SLIDING AND OPERATES WITH AN ELLIPTICAL BEND RADIUS MULTIPLIER.",

THE BREAKTHROUGH IS BASED ON A NEW CLASS OF CERAMIC OXIDES CALLED SUPEREMITTERS, WHICH ARE SIMILAR IN STRUCTURE TO SUPERCONDUCTORS, CONTAINING A MIXTURE OF DIFFERENT OXIDES SUCH AS YTTERBIUM, YTTRIUM, ALUMINUM, AND ERBIUM. THE PLANNED TPV SUPEREMITTING SUBSYSTEM IS DESIGNEDTO INTERFACE WITH AN APPLIANCE THAT IS PART WATER HEATER ANDPART HYDRONIC SPACE HEATER. THE OBJECTIVE OF PHASE II IS TOINTEGRATE THE 100 W TPV SYSTEM INTO A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT COMBINATION APPLIANCE. PHASE I INVOLVES THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, AND EVALUATION OF TWO SEPARATE APPROACHES TO YIELD 100 W. THE GOAL IS TO PRODUCE A TPV SUBSYSTEM THAT WILL COST THE APPLIANCE MANUFACTURER LESS THAN $250. THE TWO APPROACHES ARE AS FOLLOWS: (1) AN ADVANCED, PROPRIETARY SUPEREMITTER MATERIAL IS TESTED AGAINST SEVERAL PHOTOVOLTAICS INCLUDING INGAASP, INGAASI, AND CUINSE TO DETERMINE THE BEST MATCH. THE MATCHED EMITTER/COLLECTOR PAIR WILL BE OPTIMIZED BY DESIGN OF THE PHOTON COLLECTOR SYSTEM, (2) THE TEMPERATURE OF THE EXISTING SUPEREMITTING YTTERBIA-BASED FIBER MATRIX BURNER SYSTEM IS RAISED BY MEANSOF PREHEATED AIR.

IN METALLIC BEARINGS, WE HAVE MEASURED SPHERICITY TO 50PPM (.0002 MM IN .5 CM BEARING) AND, IN ADDITION, WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF FLAWS WITH THE SAME SENSITIVITY. RECENT TESTS BY LANL, USING A JOINT LANL/QUATRO PATENT DISCLOSURE, HAVE INCREASED THIS SENSITIVITY SEVERALFOLD, HOWEVER, THESE RESULTS HAVE NOT BEEN QUANTIFIED. THIS CONCEPT UTILIZES THE DETECTION OF HARMONIC COMPARISONS IN BOTH THE DRY AND SOLVENT WETTED CONDITIONS. QUATRO WILL APPLY THIS TECHNIQUE TO CERAMIC BEARINGS BY SUBJECTING THE SUBSTRATE TO A BROAD SPECTRUM ACOUSTIC SIGNAL AND EXAMINING THE RESULTANT HARMONIC RESONANCES. OUR INSTRUMENTATION WILL THEN SUBTRACT THE SPECTRA TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF FLAWS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A PROCESS, INCLUDING THE SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND PROCEDURES BY WHICH A CERAMIC BEARING MAY HAVE ITS SPECTRUM TAKEN WITHIN 1 SECOND. THIS WILL THEN BE DEVELOPED INTO AN ACCEPTANCE TEST TO SELECT QUALIFIED BEARINGS.

THE NOVEL APPROACH PROPOSED IS THE USE OF A DUAL FREQUENCY CVL TO ACHIEVE HIGH ACCURACY OVER A WIDE RANGE OF OPERATIONAL ALTITUDES (10 TO 20,000 FEET). THE ALGORITHM APPROACH AND THEORETICAL EQUATIONS FOR DETERMINING THREE-AXIS VELOCITY, AS WELL AS A STUDY OF THE RANDOM AND BIAS ERRORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CVL WILL BE INVESTIGATED. A CONTROLLED TEST USING RD INSTRUMENT'S EXISTING OPERATIONAL 75 KHZ CORRELATION SONAR WILL BE CONDUCTED TO VALIDATE THE THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS.",

This proposal descirbes the steps needed to develop a stress measurement system that relies on ultrasonic (acoustoelastic) wave measurements. The recent advancements made in the use of critically refracted longitudinal waves (CRLW), coupled with expansion of computer-assisted ultrasonic detection systems, have given impetus to this proposal. This study involves the analysis of thr CRLW phenomena, identification of state-of-the-art support apparatus, experimental verification of fundemental premises, and the development of a design specification for a stress analysis system.",

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS (1) TO IDENTIFY NEW CHEMICAL HEAT SOURCES AND POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS, AND (2) TO CONDUCT A SYSTEMS ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE NEW APPROACHES. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THREE GENERAL AREAS OF CHEMICAL HEAT SOURCES AND POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS WHICH WILL BE INVESTIGATED. THESE SOURCES ARE: AN ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL WITH HIGH ENERGY DENSITY THAT CAN PRODUCE A CONTROLLED HEAT OUTPUT. APPLICATIONS INCLUDE HEATERS FOR FOOD OR WATER, BLOOD OR SIMILAR MEDICAL SUPPLIES, BOOTS OR GLOVES, AND PORTABLE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. EXOTHERMIC REACTION OF A METAL WITH WATER. A NOVEL METHOD OF CONTROLLING THE RATE OF THIS REACTION IS DESCRIBED. APPLICATIONS INCLUDE HEATING WATER FOR DRINKING OR WASHING, AND HEATING BATTERIES OR EQUIPMENT. CONTROLLED COMBUSTION OF HYDROCARBON FUELS FOR INFRARED DECOYS TO SIMULATE VEHICLES. TWO DISTINCT APPROACHES ARE DESCRIBED FOR A LOW-COST, LIGHTWEIGHT DECOY WHICH USES MINIMAL FUEL TO GENERATE THE APPROPRIATE HEAT SIGNATURE AND DOES NOT EMIT VISIBLE LIGHT.

THERMAL SELECTIVE REDUCTION TECHNIQUES ARE EFFECTIVE ONLY INA NARROW TEMPERATURE WINDOW. IN LARGE SYSTEMS, THIS WINDOW MAY SHIFT AS THE COMBUSTOR OPERATION CHANGES, REDUCING EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSURING AMMONIA SLIP. REACTION ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL'S PREVIOUS RESEARCH STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SELECTIVE THERMAL REDUCTION TECHNIQUES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I RESEARCH PROGRAM IS TO EXTEND THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE INFLUENCE OF CO/H2/O2 CONCENTRATIONS ON THE REDUCTION OF NOX BY SELECTIVE REDUCINGREAGENTS IN ORDER TO DEFINE THE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIMPROVED CONTROL TECHNIQUE.

USING MICRO-SCALE AND COMPLEMENTARY MACRO-SCALE IMAGING ANALYSES BASED ON QUANTIFIABLE NIR ABSORPTION AND PL, IN COMBINATION WITH ADVANCED CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT DOPANT CONCENTRATION LEVELS RANGING FROM 10 X20 TO THE MID 10 X15/CM X3 CAN BE QUANTITATIVELY ANALYZED WITH THE REQUIRED PRECISION WITH AT LEAST 10 NANOMETER DEPTH RESOLUTION. THE NIR IMAGING AND ANALYSIS APPROACH TO BE DEVELOPED WILL PERMIT IN ADDITION THE DETECTION OF DISLOCATION NETWORKS, PRECIPITATES, AND LATTICE STRAIN; IT IS TO BE APPLIED TO DOUBLE SIDED POLISHED WAFERS, TO EPITAXIAL LAYERS AND TO ION-IMPLANT SYSTEM. THE \"NEAR REAL TIME NATURE\" OF THE ANALYSIS MAKES IT SUITABLE FOR QUALITY CONTROL AND THE RELATED IMAGING PROCESS WILL PROVIDE FOR A READILY RETRIEVABLE DEFECT RECORD FOR EACH WAFER ANALYZED. THE COSTS FOR THE REQUIRED HARDWARE ARE EXPECTED TO BE A FRACTION ONLY OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF INSTRUMENTATION FOR CONVENTIONAL ELECTRICAL CHARACTERIZATION.

PURE TELEOPERATION REQUIRES CONSTANT OPERATOR ATTENTION DURING \"MENIAL TASKS\" SUCH AS DRIVING, WHICH ELIMINATES ANY OF THE POTENTIAL FORCE MULTIPLICATION AVAILABLE WITH SINGLE OPERATOR/ MULTI-VEHICLE CONTROL. CURRENTLY DARPA IS ACTIVELY DEVELOPING THE KEY TECHNOLOGIES TO PROVIDE AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION FUNCTIONS FOR UNMANNED GROUND VEHICLES AND WILL DEMONSTRATE THIS TECHNOLOGY UNDER A PROGRAM CALLED \"DEMO III,. DEMO II WILL USE FOUR SURROGATE SEMI-AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES (SSV) WORKING AUTONOMOUSLY IN A COOPERATIVE MISSION. IN ORDER TO INSURE THE SUCCESS OF DEMO II, EACH OF THE UNIVERSITIES AND KEY ORGANIZATIONS DEVELOPING PIECES OF THE ADVANCED SOFTWARE AND ELECTRONIC HARDWARE REQUIRED NEED A COMMON LABORATORY TESTBED TO PROVE OUT THEIR SOFTWARE ALGORITHMS AND HARDWARE COMPONENTS BEFORE INTEGRATION ONTO THE FIELDED SSV SYSTEMS. THESE COMMON LABORATORY TESTBEDS SHOULD BE EASY TO WORK WITH AND MODIFY AND BE 100% ELECTRONICALLY AND SOFTWARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE FIELDED SSV SYSTEMS TO REDUCE TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER RISK TO THE FIELDED SYSTEMS. RST WILL PROVIDE AN ALL-ELECTRIC, SMALLSCALE, LOW COST ROBOTIC RESEARCH VEHICLE (RRV) WHICH IS HIGHLY SUITED FOR THE LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT AND IS FUNCTIONALLY IDENTICAL TO THE SSV. THE ROBOTIC RESEARCH VEHICLE WILL ALSO BE CAPABLE OF BEING USED FOR SEVERAL ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS SUCH AS INTERIOR PHYSICAL SECURITY (GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL), NUCLEAR WASTE CLEANUP, EOD, AND AS A TESTBED FOR FUTURE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES BY THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY.",

FABRICATION TECHNIQUES EXISTS TO TAILOR THE PHASE PROFILE OF EACH ZONE; THIS PROVIDES A DIFFRACTIVE LENS THAT EXHIBITS HIGH DIFFRACTION EFFICIENCY. FOR MANY CASES OF PRACTICAL INTEREST, WE HAVE SHOWN THAT A SINGLE DIFFRACTIVE LENS ACTUALLY PERFORMS BETTER THAN CONVENTIONAL LENS SYSTEMS CONSISTING OF SEVERAL AIR-SPACED GLASS ELEMENTS. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF UTILIZING DIFFRACTIVE OPTICS TECHNOLOGY TO ANSWER PERFORMANCE CONSTRAINTS IN COMPACT SPECTRUM ANALYZERS AND MINIBENCH TIME-INTEGRATING CORRELATORS.

LIQUID-VAPOR ABSORPTIONCYCLE EFFICIENCIES ARE LIMITED BY THEIR STAGING AND DO NOT BENEFIT FROM LOW LIFT APPLICATIONS AS ENCOUNTERED IN THE ENVISIONED APPLICATION. IN THIS STUDY, A CONSTANT PRESSURE,ENGINE-STAGED, SOLID-VAPOR HEAT PUMP, IS BEING DEVELOPED WHICH DOES NOT DEPEND ON GRAVITY, HAS NO PHASE SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS OR MOVING PARTS, AND CAN BE HEAT OR COMPRESSOR ACTIVATED.

THE MEASUREMENT WOULD BE CONDUCTED DURING THE DESCENT PHASE OF A SMALL ROCKET FLIGHT. IN THE PHASE I OF THIS RESEARCH EFFORT, WE PROPOSE TO MAKE SEVERAL MEASUREMENTS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO DESIGN A WATER-VAPOR DETECTOR BASED ON A DIODE-LASER-PUMPED SOLID-STATE LASER. WE WILL USE EITHER A THULIUM LASER, WHICH IS CONTINUOUSLY TUNABLE FROM 1.85 UM TO OVER 2 UM, OR AN ERBIUM LASER, WHICH HAS SEVERAL EMISSION LINES BETWEEN 2.6 UM AND 2.9 UM. THE LASER WILL BE ALTERNATELY TUNED ON AND OFF A STRONG ABSORPTION LINE, AND BOTH THE SHIFTED FLUORESCENCE EXCITED BY THE LASER, AND THE BACKSCATTERED LIGHT AT THE LASER WAVELENGTH WILL BE COLLECTED. AT HIGH ALTITUDES, BOTH SIGNALS WILL BE DUE TO WATER-VAPOR FLUORESCENCE, AND THE H2O CONCENTRATION WILL BE CALCULATED FROM THE INTENSITY. AT LOWER ALTITUDES, WHERE THE FLUORESCENCE IS QUENCHED, THE [H2O] WILL BE CALCULATED FROM THE DIFFERENCE IN THE BACKSCATTERED INTENSITY WHEN THE LASER IS TUNED ON OR OFF THE ABSORPTION PEAK. MEASUREMENTS OF THE H2O FLUORESCENCE QUANTUM YIELD AND RADIATIVE LIFETIME AS A FUNCTION OF PRESSURE, AND A DEMONSTRATION OF RAPID TUNING BETWEEN AN ABSORPTION PEAK AND MINIMUM WILL BE CONDUCTED. WE WILL ALSO EXAMINE APPROACHES BASED ON RAMAN SCATTERING AND FLUORESCENCE EXCITED BY ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT.

THE PROPOSED DESIGN USES A GAAS LASER DIODE OPERATING WITH A VERY SHORT PULSE AT A PULSE RATE SUCH THAT RANGE MEASUREMENTS ARE MADE EVERY 3.5 INCHES ON A 400 FOOT DIAMETER CIRCLE ABOUT THE HELICOPTER. THE HORIZONAL SCANNING IS ACCOMPLISHED BY A SIMPLE ROTATING PRISM WITH A SHAFT ENCODER PROVIDING THE AZIMUTHAL ANGLE. THE SENSOR WOULD PROVIDE A COMPLETE NEW PLAN POSITION INDICATOR (PPI) DISPLAY 5 TIMES A SECOND. THE VERY NARROW BEAM AND NARROW PULSE WIDTH WILL PROVIDE GOOD OBSTACLE DEFINITION. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM USES A SIMPLE ANALOG TECHNIQUE FOR MEASURING RANGE WHICH YIELDS HIGH ACCURACY AND ELIMINATES THE MORE COMPLEX, HIGH POWER CONSUMPTION, ULTRA HIGH FREQUENCY DIGITAL COUNTER.

HOWEVER, THESE TARGETS SUFFER FROM SOME BEAM CURRENT LIMITATIONS CAUSED BY TARGET THINNING THAT RESULTS FROM BUBBLES FORMED IN THE WATER FROM LOCAL BOILING AND RADIOLYSIS. THESE EFFECTS ALSO DECREASE THE RELIABILITY OF WATER TARGETS; THE YIELD OBTAINED CAN VARY FROM BATCH TO BATCH BY AS MUCH AS A FACTOR OF TWO. THEPLANNED ICE TARGET ADDRESSES BOTH OF THESE CONCERNS BY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE RADIOLYSIS RATE AND ELIMINATING BOILING. IN ADDITION, THE LOW VAPOR PRESSURE OF ICE AT TEMPERATURES BELOW -100 DEGREES CENTIGRADE PERMITS THE TARGET TO BE WINDOWLESS.

IN THE PROPOSED PROGRAM, NEW ALL-SOLID-STATE ARF LASER DRIVER TECHNOLOGY WILL BE DEVELOPED TO REPLACE THYRATRON-BASED DRIVERS USED IN CURRENT, COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ARF LASERS. THIS NEW ALL-SOLID-STATE TECHNOLOGY WILL EXTEND DRIVER LIFETIME BY A FACTOR OF 20 (TO 6 X 10(10) SHOTS) AND WILL FEATURE NOVEL CIRCUITS WHICH RECOVER ENERGY REFLECTED FROM THE TIME-VARYING DISCHARGE LOAD. THE RECOVERED ENERGY WILL BE STORED AND THEN REUSED ON THE NEXT DISCHARGE PULSE. THESE ENERGY RECOVERY CIRCUITS WILL EXTEND LASER DISCHARGE ELECTRODE LIFE AND INCREASE OVERALL LASER EFFICIENCY. THIS NEW DRIVER WILL ALSO BE DESIGNED TO INCREASE ARF LASER REPETITION RATE FROM 400 PPS TO 1000 PPS, INCREASE LASER DUTY FACTOR AND THEREBY EXTEND THE LIFE OF THE DEEP-UV LASER RESONATOR OPTICS. THIS ALL-SOLID-STATE ARF LASER DRIVER TECHNOLOGY IS BASED ON SCR-COMMUTATED, NONLINEAR MAGNETIC PULSE COMPRESSION COUPLED WITH A NOVEL FRACTIONAL-TURN TRANSFORMER WHICH ENABLES AN EXTREMELY COMPACT, LOW COST, MODULAR DESIGN. IN THE PHASE I EFFORT, FINAL DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS FOR THIS DRIVER WILL BE ESTABLISHED AND A DETAILED ENGINEERING DESIGN OF THE DRIVER WILL BE COMPLETED. IN THE PHASE II EFFORT, THIS DRIVER WILL BE FABRICATED AND EXTENSIVELY TESTED. THE NEW ALL-SOLID-STATE PULSED POWER TECHNOLOGY TO BE DEVELOPED IN THIS EFFORT WILL EXTEND ARF LASER DRIVER LIFETIME BY A FACTOR OF 20 OVER PREVIOUS THYRATRONBASED DESIGNS, EXTEND LASER DISCHARGE ELECTRODE LIFETIME AND OPTICS LIFETIME AND INCREASE LASER POWER AND EFFICIENCY. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS INCLUDE USE OF THESE DRIVERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RELIABLE RARE GAS HALIDE LASERS FOR METALWORKING (WELDING, CUTTING, HEAT TREATING), MEDICINE (NEUROSURGERY LITHOTRIPSY, ANGIOPLASTY, CORNEAL SCULPTING) AND DEEP-UV PROJECTION LITHOGRAPHY.",

PHASE I WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THE HADDOCK IS SUITABLE FOR NET-PEN CULTURE BY ATTEMPTING TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: 1. IS THE GROWTH RATE OF HADDOCK ON ARTIFICIAL DIETS COMPARABLE TO THAT OF SALMONIDS? 2. ARE MODIFIED SALMONID NET-PENS SUITABLE FOR REARING HADDOCK? 3. CAN HADDOCK AND SALMONIDS BE REARED TOGETHER IN A POLYCULTURE SYSTEM? IF THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS ARE FAVORABLE, PHASE II WOULD INCLUDE SPAWNING AND LARVAL REARING.

PRIOR TO MICROENCAPSULATION, THE STABILITY OFROTAVIRUS INFECTIVITY TO DIFFERENT ORGANIC SOLVENTS WILL BE STUDIED. FOLLOWING MICROENCAPSULATION, ROTAVIRUS MICROSPHERES WILL BE CHARACTERIZED WITH RESPECT TO THEIR SIZE DISTRIBUTION, MORPHOLOGY, AND VIRUS CONTENT. THE IN VITRO RELEASE RATE OF THE VIRUS FROM THE MICROCAPSULE WILL ALSO BE DETERMINED BY PLAQUE ASSAY. MICROENCAPSULATED ROTAVIRUS WILL THEN BE TREATED WITH LOW PH AS WELL AS WITH VARIOUS PROTEASES, AND THE VIRUS INFECTIVITY WILL BE EXAMINED IN ORDER TO TEST THE STABILITY OF INFECTIVITY IN THE GASTRIC ENVIRONMENT. ONCE SATISFACTORY RESULTS ARE OBTAINED, AN IN VIVO IMMUNIZATION STUDY USING PIGLETS WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN PHASE II.",

MEASUREMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE BOTH THE BROADBAND AND DISCRETE SPECTRAL RADIANCE AS A FUNCTION OF SUBSTRATE ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WILL LEAD TO EFFICIENT SPECTRALLY ENHANCED, EOCM DEVICES. THESE DEVICES WILL USE A SURFACE DISCHARGE PLASMA AS THE SPECTALLY TAILORED RADIATIVE SOURCE. THE PHASE I PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE A FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SURFACE DISCHARGE SPECTRAL RADIANT ENHANCEMENT IN THE ULTRAVIOLET, VISIBLE AND INFRARED SPECTRAL REGIONS. THE PHASE II PROGRAM WILL OPTIMIZE THE SPECTRAL EMISSIVE CHARACTERIZED THE DISCHARGE ON THE OUTSIDE OF A CYLINDER FOR 360 DEG DIRECTIONAL COVERAGE.",

THIS PROPOSAL WILL ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE-ART OF SILICON GUIDED-WAVE OPTICS, ESPECIALLY SILICON OPTICAL INTERCONNECTS. WE SHALL INVESTIGATE A NOVEL, THREE-DIMENSIONAL, SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) GUIDED-WAVE STRUCTURE THAT WILL ALLOW OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS ON TWO STACKED LEVELS WITHIN A LARGE-AREA SILICON WAFER. TO DO THIS WE SHALL USE MULTIPLE IMPLANTS OF OXYGEN IONS BASED ON SPIRE'S UNIQUE EXPERIENCE IN PRODUCING MULTI-LEVEL SEPARATION BY IMPLANTATION OF OXYGEN (SIMOX) STRUCTURES. IN ADDITION, WE SHALL EXAMINE WAYS OF FABRICATING LOW-LOSS SOI WAVEGUIDES AND HIGH-SPEED ELECTRO-OPTIC (EO) DEVICES INTEGRATED IN SOI WAVEGUIDES. LOW-LOSS GUIDING AND PRACTICAL EO COMPONENTS ARE TWO KEY AREAS THAT NEED TO BE RESEARCHED TO ESTABLISH THAT SILICON IS A VIABLE AND VALUABLE OPTICAL MATERIAL. GOAL OF THE PHASE II WORK WILL BE TO EXPLOIT PHASE I RESULTS TO CONSTRUCT PRACTICAL, HIGH PERFORMANCE, GUIDED-WAVE ELECTRO-OPTIC COMPONENTS IN SOI. THE BEST-SUITED SIMOX STRUCTURES FROM PHASE I WILL BE SELECTED. SOME POSSIBLE APPROACHES FOR PHASE II ARE TO FABRICATE SCHOTTKY-BARRIER OR P-N JUNCTION ELECTRODES ON SOI CHANNEL WAVEGUIDES TO OBTAIN HIGH-PERFORMANCE OPTICAL PHASE MODULATORS FOR THE 1.3 MICRON WAVELENGTH.",

AN ELECTRODE-LESS DEVICE IS EXPECTED TO BE MORE ACCURATE THAN A CONVENTIONAL DEVICE DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF ANY METAL ELECTRODES THAT TEND TO DISTURB THE FIELDS. THE KEY TO THE PROPOSED EFFORT IS THE TECHNIQUE OF SELECTIVELY REVERSE POLING A CHANNEL WAVEGUIDE SECTION IN THE CRYSTAL MATERIAL, LITHIUM NIOBATE, BY APPROPRIATE CHOICE OF CRYSTAL ORIENTATION AND TITANIUM DIFFUSION CONDITIONS. A MACH-ZEHNDER WAVEGUIDE INTERFEROMETER IS THEN CREATED USING A LOW TEMPERATURE PROTON EXCHANGE PROCESS IN WHICH ONE LEG OF THE INTERFEROMETER IS SUPERIMPOSED ON TOP OF THE REVERSE POLED CHANNEL CREATED IN THE PREVIOUS TEP. THE EFFECT OF AN EXTERNAL ELECTRI FIELD IN AN ELECTRODE-LESS DEVICE IS EQUIVALENT TO APPLYING VOLTAGES OF OPPOSITE POLARITIE TO THE ELECTRODES IN A CONVENTIONAL DEVICE. A NOVEL COMPLEMENTARY PHOTODETECTION SCHEME IS PROPOSED THAT REPLACES THE OUTPUT Y-BRANCH OF THE INTERFEROMETER WITH A DIRECTIONAL COUPLER. THIS GREATLY REDUCES THE EFFECTS OF LASER INTENSITY NOISE AND THUS LEADS TO TENS OF DB IMPROVEMENT IN DYNAMIC RANGE (>40 DB FOR A 1 GHZ BANDWIDTH). A COMPACT LOW VOLTAGE CALIBRATION SYSTEM IS DECRIBED THAT EXPLOITS THE SMALL SIZE OF THE INTEGRATED OPTICAL DEVICE.",

A UNIQUE, PATENTED ROTARY MACHINE, THE FIRTH SOLIDS PUMP (FSP), HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WHICH CONTINUOUSLY, ACCURATELY, AND EFFICIENTLY METERS AND FEEDS VIRTUALLY ALL PARTICULATE SOLIDS INTO ATMOSPHERIC AND LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS. FSP HAS ONLY ONE MOVING PART; HAS NO VANES, FLITES, OR OTHER WEAR-PRONE PROJECTIONS; AND PROVIDESAN EFFECTIVE SEAL AGAINST BACKFLOW. THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED ON A WIDE RANGE OF MATERIALS AND APPLIED COMMERCIALLY AS A FINAL FEEDER IN A PULVERIZED FUEL COAL ELECTRIC GENERATING PLANT. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR SUCH A DEVICE WITH THE CAPACITY TO OPERATE AT HIGHER PRESSURES. THE WIDESPREAD UTILIZATION OF SUCH IMPORTANT NEWPROCESSES AS THE PRESSURIZED FLUIDIZED-BED COMBUSTOR (PFBC) TOPPING CYCLE, WHICH OFFERS HIGH EFFICIENCY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE IN COAL-POWERED ELECTRIC GENERATION, IS IMPERILED BY THE INADEQUACY OF EXISTING EQUIPMENT TO METER AND FEED COAL AND REINJECT CHAR INTO HIGHPROCESS PRESSURES. THIS PROJECT IS DEVELOPING THE FSP FURTHER TO PROVIDE RELIABLE, CONTINUOUS, ACCURATELY METERED INJECTION OF SOLIDS INTO HIGHER PRESSURES FOR PFBC AND MANY OTHER PROCESS USES. IN PHASE I, BENCH-SCALE EXAMINATION IS BEING CONDUCTED OF THE SEVERAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT DELIVERY OF POWERPLANT COAL INTO PRESSURES UP TO THE RANGE OF 100 PSI. THE RESULT WILL BE THE DESIGN OF A FULLSCALE COMMERCIAL UNIT TO BE CONSTRUCTED AND INSTALLED FOR EXTENDEDOPERATION IN PHASE II.

BECAUSE CENTRIFUGATION IS A PART OF THE PROBLEM, THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO DEVISE A SYSTEM FOR PREPARING PLASMA BY FILTRATION. THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL PROCESS BLOOD 10 TIMES FASTER THAN CONVENTIONAL PROCEDURES. FURTHERMORE, THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE CAN BE AUTOMATED TO DISPENSE ALIQUOTS OF PLASMA INTO SEPARATE TEST TUBES FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. THE DEVICE WILL ELIMINATE THE DIRT AND DANGER OF PROCESSING BLOOD, DECREASE THE TIME FOR PREPARING SAMPLES, AND ELIMINATE THE NUMBER OF SKILLED TECHNICIANS NEEDED TO PROCESS BLOOD SAMPLES.",

WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH FREQUENCY FIBER OPTIC ANALOG LINKS, OPTICAL CABLES HAVE BEEN USED TO ISOLATE THE MEASUREMENT ANTENNA. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS EFFORTS HAVE HAD THE DISADVANTAGE OF REQUIRING A RELATIVELY LARGE PHYSICAL VOLUME AT THE ANTENNA LOCATION, WHICH PERTURBS THE FIELD BEING MEASURED. IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM, TACAN HAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED AND TESTED A NEW APPROACH FOR HIGH FREQUENCY FIELD MEASUREMENTS USING REMOTE OPTICAL POWERING TO ELIMINATE BATTERY OPERATION OF THE ELECTRONICS AND ELECTRO-OPTICS. A SPECIAL ELECTRO-OPTIC INTERFACE HAS BEEN DESIGNED, CONSISTING OF PASSIVE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS TO COMPLETE A BIAS TEE NETWORK AND PROVIDE IMPEDANCE MATCHING. THE TOTAL VOLUME FOR THE ELECTRO-OPTIC INTERFACE UNIT CAN BE LESS THAN 1 CM3. NO BATTERIES ARE REQUIRED, AND THEREFORE OPERATION IS CONTINUOUS WITHOUT INTERRUPTIONS FOR BATTERY REPLACEMENT. NEW TECHNIQUES ARE DESCRIBED TO EXTEND THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE TO 100 GHZ. THE ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS WOULD BENEFIT A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING ANTENNA DEVELOPMENT, MONITORING OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS FOR POTENTIAL HAZARDS, AND EMI AND RFI MEASUREMENTS. COMPLETELY ACCURATE AND NON-PERTURBING MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES HAVE NOT BEEN AVAILABLE TO DATE AND WOULD BE INVALUABLE FOR SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS.",

CATHODES FOR SUCH MOLTEN-SALT LITHIUM BATTERIES MUST HAVE HIGH THEORETICAL ENERGY DENSITY AND GOOD REACTION RATES. PROPOSED PHASE I PROGRAM OBJECTIVES ARE ORIENTED TOWARDS IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING CATHODE MATERIALS WHICH CAN OPERATE IN A RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM MOLTEN-SALT BATTERY FOR DELIVERING EXCEEDINGLY HIGH PULSE POWER LEVELS. THESE NOVEL CATHODE MATERIALS ARE EXPECTED TO YIELD OPERATING CELL VOLTAGES OF 1 VOLT HIGHER THAN THOSE FOR THE LITHIUM/METAL SULFIDE HIGH TEMPERATURE SYTEMS. PHASE I PROGRAM CONSISTS OF STUDYING ELECTROCHEMISTRY OF A VARIETY OF PROMISING CANDIDATE MATERIALS IN THE LICL-KCL MOLTEN SALTS. THE CHEMICAL AND ELECTROCHEMICAL STABILITY OF THESE CATHODE MATERIALS WILL ALSO BE INVESTIGATED. CELL STUDIES WITH TWO MOST PROMISING CATHODE MATERIALS WILL BE CARRIED OUT TO ESTABLISH THE RECHARGEABILITY, DISCHARGE PULSE POWER PERFORMANCE AND CHARACTERIZATION UNDER REPETITAVE PULSING REGIMES. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROGRAM WILL FORM THE BASIS FOR A PHASE II PROGRAM IN WHICH DESIGN, FABRICATION AND TESTING OF A BATTERY PROTOTYPE IS ENVISAGED.",

THE DESIGN USES ONLY ONE SEAL PER CELLIN THE FUEL MANIFOLD, IS MADE USING SIMPLE, LOW COST CERAMICFABRICATION TECHNIQUES, AND CAN USE AUTOMATED STACK MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES TO PRODUCE A LOW COST SOFC SYSTEM. THE DESIGN IS A VARIATION OF THE INTERSCIENCE RADIAL FLOW (IRF) FUEL CELL USING OXYGEN DIFFUSION TO PROVIDE OXIDANT RATHER THAN FORCED CONVECTION. THE TWO KEY PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SINGLE MANIFOLD IRF DESIGN (SMIRF) ARE POROUS, PARTICULATE ELECTRODES AND THE SINGLE MANIFOLD. PARTICULATE ELECTRODES ELIMINATE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THERMAL EXPANSION COEFFICIENT MISMATCHES BY ALLOWING THE SEPARATOR, SEALS, AND ELECTROLYTE TO EXPAND AT DIFFERENT RATES, AND CHANGE POSITION WITH RESPECT TO THE ELECTRODE WITHOUT LOSINGELECTRICAL CONTACT. SIMPLE, INEXPENSIVE MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED, SUCH AS TAPE CASTING AND STAMPING. THE SINGLE MANIFOLD DESIGN ALLOWS INTERNAL MANIFOLDING OF THE FUEL STREAM ONLY, REQUIRING ONLY ONE SEAL PER CELL. THUS, EXHAUST MANIFOLDS ARE NEEDED. PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS USING SINGLE CELL IRFS HAVE PROVED THE FEASIBILITY OF USING PARTICULATE ELECTRODES WITH FORCED CONVECTION OF BOTH FUEL AND OXIDANT. PHASE I INCLUDES STUDIES TO VERIFY THE FEASIBILITY OF OXYGEN DIFFUSION-BASED FUEL CELL OPERATION.

THE USE OF SCREEN CATHODES PRESENTS THE PROBLEM OF MECHANICAL STRENGTH. SCREEN CATHODES MADE OUT OF WIRE MESH ARE EXCELLENT LIGHT TRANSMITTERS BUT LACK MECHANICAL STRENGTH, NOT TO MENTION THAT THEY CAN BE DESTROYED BY ARCING. CATHODES MADE OUT OF PERFORATED ALUMINUM OR STAINLESS STEEL ARE MECHANICALLY SOUND, BUT LIGHT TRANSMISION IS NO BETTER THAN 60%. IF THE WORK BEING PERFORMED IS SUCCESSFUL, THE USE OF SCREENS IN BETWEEN THE PHOTIONIZATION SOURCE AND THE MAIN DISCHARGE WOULD BE ELIMINATED BY INTEGRATING THE PHOTOIONIZATION SOURCE TO THE CATHODE SURFACE. A SECOND MORE IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY BREAKTHROUGH IS THE ABILITY OF THIS CONCEPT TO WORK AT VERY HIGH FREQUENCIES, FROM A FEW KILOHERTZ UP TO HUNDREDS OF MEGAHERTZ. THESE HIGH REPETION RATES ARE POSSBIEL DUE TO THE EXTREMELY LOW INDUCTANCE OF THE CONCEPT AND THE WAY THE COUPLING WITH THE DRIVING CIRCUIT COULD BE CHANGED FROM CAPACTIVE TO RESISTIVE OR A TUNED COMBINATION. DEVELOPMENT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IN THE LARGE SURFACE, HIGH CURRENT DENSITY REGIMENS WOULD REPRESENT A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN CATHODE TECHNOLOGY. SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES, IMPLICIT TO THE DESIGN, ARE THE CURRENT AND VOLTAGE GAIN.

IN PARTICULAR, HIGH VOLTAGE REPETITIVE SWITCHES ARE NEEDED WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY GO BEYOND THE PRESENT CAPABILITIES OF KNOWN SWITCHES. FUTURE SWITCHING TECHNOLOGY NEEDS TO HANDLE VOLTAGES RANGING FROM HUNDREDS OF KILOVOLTS TO MEGAVOLTS, HUNDREDS OF KILOAMPERES TO MEGAAMPERES, AND REPETITION RATES UP TO 100 KILOHERTZ. THE SWITCHING TECHNOLOGY OF THE FUTURE MUST SATISY THESE CONDITIONS AS WELL AS HAVE LOW TIMING JITTER, LOW SWITCHING DELAYS, HAVE LONG LIFETIMES, OPERATE AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES, AND HAVE LOW LOSSES. WE PROPOSE A NEW SWITCH TECHNOLOGY WHICH OFFERS SCALABILITY TO ALL OF THE ABOVE REQUIREMENTS. WE PROPOSE TO DESIGN, FABRICATE, AND TEST OUR PROPOSED SWITCH IN THIS PHASE I EFFORT. THE OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE CONCEPT AND PROVIDE A BASIS FOR A PHASE II OPTIMIZATION AND CHARACTERIZATION PROGRAM.",

TO REDUCE THIS PROBLEM, REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS ARE PLANNED BASEDON THE USE OF HYDROGEN ABSORBED AND DESORBED BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT METAL HYDRIDES. BECAUSE THESE MATERIALS STORE EXTREMELY LARGE VOLUMES OF HYDROGEN, THEY HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL FOR COOLING AND REFRIGERATION, WHICH OCCURS WHEN HYDROGEN IS DESORBED FROM ONE OF THE HYDRIDES IN THE SYSTEM. HOWEVER, NO CURRENT HYDROGEN SYSTEM DESIGNS HAVE A COEFFICIENT OF PERFORMANCE (COP) LARGE ENOUGH TO COMPETE WITH CONVENTIONAL CHLOROFLUOROCARBON (CFC) SYSTEMS. DURING SOME RECENTLY COMPLETED RESEARCH WORK, AN APPROACH THAT ALLOWS A HYDRIDE-DRIVEN REFRIGERATION SYSTEM TO EXCEED THE COP OF CONVENTIONAL CFC SYSTEMS WAS DISCOVERED. BASED ON CALCULATIONS, THIS INNOVATIVE SYSTEM, WITH A CHOICE OF CERTAIN METAL HYDRIDE PAIRS, APPROACHES THE EFFICIENCY OF A CARNOT CYCLE, AND THE COP CAN BE AS HIGH AS 1.0. THE PURPOSE OF THE PHASE I RESEARCH IS TO TEST A LABORATORY WORKING MODEL OF THIS INNOVATIVE HYDRIDE-DRIVEN REFRIGERATORAND TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE APPROACH. EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINED COPS NEAR 1.0 WILL CORROBORATE THECALCULATIONS AND PROVE THAT METAL HYDRIDE SYSTEMS CAN BE MADE TO BE VERY COMPETITIVE WITH CONVENTIONAL REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS.

REDUCED PIXEL COUNT AND REDUCTION IN CALCULATIONS PER PIXEL SUGGEST THE FEASIBILITY OF COMPACT, HIGH-PERFORMANCE SYSTEMS NOT POSSIBLE WITH CARTESIAN SYSTEMS. RECENT THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE THE FORMULATION OF NEW ALGORITHMS FOR VISUAL TRACKING AND DEPTH MAPPING. RECENT HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDE THE CONSTRUCTION OF VIDEO RATE REMAPPERS WHICH CONVERT CARTESIAN IMAGERY TO LOG-POLAR COORDINATES AND THE WORLD'S FIRST CCD CHIP TESSELLATED IN LOG-POLAR COORDINATES. THE TIME HAS COME TO INTEGRATE THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DESIGN OF A NEW TYPE OF ROBOT VISION SYSTEM. PHASE I WILL DESIGN A ROBOT VISION TESTBED WHICH INTEGRATES THE NEW ALGORITHMS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF USEFUL VISUAL FUNCTIONS SUCH AS DYNAMIC DEPTH MAPPING AND CAMERA/VEHICLE MOTION CONTROL. PHASE I METHODS INCLUDE MATHEMATICS, SIMULATION AND SYSTEM DESIGN. PHASE II INCLUDES CONSTRUCTION OF A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WHICH ROBUSTLY AND EFFICIENTLY PERFORMS SUCH FUNCTIONS. ULTIMATE BENEFITS INCLUDE ROBOT VISION SYSTEMS THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE MORE COMPACT THAN THOSE POSSIBLE USING CARTESIAN COORDINATES, OPENING THE DOOR TO COST-EFFECTIVE COMMERCIAL ROBOTS WITH POWERFUL VISION SYSTEMS OCCUPYING ONLY A FEW CUBIC INCHES.",

THESE ANTIBODIES ARE INDUCED IN A VARIETY OF CLINICAL CIRCUMSTANCES, AND IT IS LIKELY THAT THE ABOVE CLINICAL ASSOCIATIONS ARE LIMITED ONLYTO PATIENTS WITH PARTICULAR SUBGROUPS OF ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID (APL) ANTIBODIES. ANTIBODY SUBGROUPS MAY DIFFER IN THEIR AFFINITIES FOR PARTICULAR PHOSPHOLIPIDS OR IN THEIR SPECIFICITIES FOR PARTICULAR PHOSPHOLIPID CONFORMATIONS, SUCH CONFORMATIONS BEING DETERMINED BY PHOSPHOLIPID-LIPID MIXTURES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MANIPULATION OF PHOSPHOLIPID ANTIGEN CONCENTRATION OR OF PHOSPHOLIPID-LIPID MIXTURES IN AN ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA) SYSTEM MAY ENABLE MORE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENTS WITH APS. WITH A VIEW TO PREPARING A MARKETABLE ELISA KIT SPECIFICALLYDESIGNED TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS WITH APS, THIS STUDY WILL COMPARE ELISA SYSTEMS WITH VARYING CONCENTRATIONS OF NEGATIVELY CHARGED PHOSPHOLIPIDS AND PHOSPHOLIPID-LIPID MIXTURES TO DETERMINE THE SYSTEM THAT IS MOST SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC FOR IDENTIFYING APS PATIENTS. MATERIALS USED IN THE ASSAY SYSTEMS WILL BE EVALUATED FOR THEIR STABILITY OVERTIME TO DETERMINE THEIR UTILITY IN AN ELISA KIT.",

BECAUSE TYPE A INFLUENZA MAY LEAD TO PNEUMONIA IN THE ELDERLY, THIS IS OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE IN GERIATRIC FACILITIES. RAPID VIRAL DETECTION SYSTEMS FOR INFLUENZA VIRUSES (TYPES AAND B) WILL BE DEVELOPED BASED ON PRODUCTION OF HIGHLY AVID MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO THE MAJOR INTERNAL ANTIGENS OF THESE VIRUSES, INCLUDING NUCLEOPROTEIN AND M-PROTEIN (M1). MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES WILL ALSO BE PRODUCED AGAINST NSI OR NONSTRUCTURAL PROTEIN FOUND IN INFLUENZA-VIRUS-INFECTED CELLS. THESE ANTIGENS SHOW LITTLE VARIATION AMONG TYPE A INFLUENZA VIRUSES AND THEREFORE PROVIDE STABLE REAGENTS THATARE IMMUNE TO ANTIGENIC SHIFT AND DRIFT.

AN ORIENTABLE, DECOUPLEABLE BENT SUB IS SELECTIVELY ENGAGED OR DISENGAGED AS REQUIRED TO STEER THE TOOL. DURING PHASE I, CONCEPTUAL DESIGNS ARE BEING DEVELOPED, KEY COMPONENTS ARE BEING FABRICATED AND TESTED, AND A PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ANALYSIS WILL BE CONDUCTED TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY AND BENEFITS OF THE CONCEPT. MDD IS DRAWING ON THE BEST FEATURES OF SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING AND BORING TECHNIQUES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE GAS AND OIL WELL DRILLING INDUSTRY. PRIOR EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING (1) ULTRA-HIGH-PRESSURE DRILL STRING COMPONENTS AND DIRECTIONAL DRILLING EQUIPMENT FOR GAS AND OIL RESOURCE RECOVERY AND GUIDED HORIZONTAL EARTH BORING SYSTEMS AND (2) OTHER TECHNOLOGIES FOR MINING, HORIZONTAL EARTH BORING, ROCK DRILLING, AND GAS AND OIL WELL DRILLING WILL BENEFIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF MDD.",

THE FOPT, OPERATING IN EITHER THE AMPLITUDEOR PHASE-MODULATION MODE, WILL DETECT THE DISPLACEMENT OF A DIAPHRAGM AS A MEASURE OF THE EXTERNAL PRESSURE. THE FOPT WOULD HAVE VERY HIGH RESONANT FREQUENCY TO ACHIEVE A FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF BETTER THAN 150 KHZ. UNLIKE THE PIEZOELECTRIC TRANSDUCER, THE FOPT WILL MEASURE THE STATIC RATHER THAN THE DYNAMIC PRESSURE. OPTICAL SENSING VIA A FIBER-OPTIC LINK WILL ISOLATE THE ELECTRONICS FROM THE HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT AND ALLEVIATE ELECTRONIC DRIFT DUE TO INTERFERENCE FROM STRONG ELECTROMAGNETIC AND RADIO FREQUENCY FIELDS AND/OR TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS. THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT EFFORT WILL BE AN EXTENSION OF AN ONGOING ARMY-SPONSORED SBIR PHASE II PROGRAM TO DEVELOP AN FOPT FOR PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS UP TO 100,000 PSI IN GUN-BARREL ENVIRONMENTS. FOR THAT APPLICATION, SPECIAL SENSOR CONFIGURATIONS WERE DESIGNED EMPLOYING A FINITE ELEMENT ALGORITHM IN ORDER TO AVOID CONCENTRATION OF LOCAL STRESS POTENTIALLY EXCEEDING THE YIELD STRENGTH OF AVAILABLE ALLOYS. THE PROPOSED EXTENSION 120,000 PSI IS BY NO MEANS TRIVIAL. THE KEYS TO THE SUCCESS OF THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT WILL BE INNOVATIVE DESIGN OF THE SENSOR CONFIGURATION USING A HIGH-STRENGTH/LOW-MODULUS MATERIALS AS WELL AS STABILIZATION OF THE LIGHT SOURCE.",

THE TECHNOLOGY IS CAPABLE OF DETECTING ORGANIC SPECIES SUCH AS KEROSENE FILMS ON THE GROUND AND ON THE SURFACES OF RIVERS, STREAMS OR LAKES AND CAN DISTINGUISH THESE FILMS FROM OTHER PETROLEUM SLICKS. THE PRESENCE OF KEROSENE IN THESE WATERWAYS IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FLUSHING AND DISPOSAL OF THIS SOLVENT FROM THE COCAINE PROCESS. ADVANTAGES OF THIS TECHNIQUE OVER DIRECT CHEMICAL VAPOR DETECTION ARE: CHEMICAL VAPOR DETECTION IN JUNGLE SETTINGS HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN DIFFICULT DUE TO TERRAIN AND INTERFERENCES (METHANE FOR EXAMPLE). MOST PROCESSING CHEMICALS HAVE HIGH VAPOR PRESSURES, HEAVIER THAN AIR. THIS CAUSES THE MAJORITY OF THE VAPORS TO REMAIN CLOSE TO THE GROUND, WITH LITTLE OR NO CONCENTRATION OVER THE JUNGLE CANOPY. FINALLY, FLUORESCENCE TECHNIQUES ARE MUCH MORE SENSITIVE THAN TRADITIONAL ABSORPTION SYSTEMS (DIAL, RAMA, ETC...). THE PHASE I PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE: SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION, FLUORESCENCE CHARACTERIZATION IN ENVIRONMENTS, PRFS SYSTEM DESIGN, SIMULATION AND LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION, AND A PROTOTYPE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN.",

BY MONITORING THE RESULTANT STRUCTURAL VIBRATION SIGNATURE, HMS DETERMINES STRUCTURAL ABNORMALITIES USING A NETWORK OF ATTACHED SENSOR ARRAYS, DISTRIBUTED PROCESSORS, AND INDEPENDENT SIGNAL PROCESSING SOFTWARE MODULES. USING CONVENTIONAL MINIMUM DISTANCE CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS, A HIGH CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY HAS BEEN ACHIEVED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS TO EXTEND THIS RESEARCH BY IMPLEMENTING NEURAL NETWORK SOFTWARE FOR PERFORMANCE COMPARISON WITH OUR PATTERN RECOGNITION BASED ON-LINE MONITORING/ INSPECTION SYSTEM. THIS SOFTWARE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ON EXISTING FLIGHT QUALIFIED HARDWARE AND DEMONSTRATED DURING A PHASE I GROUND TEST PROGRAM. UPON SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF PHASE I, A TEST PLAN WILL BE SUBMITTED TO THE NAVY FOR A PHASE II DEMONSTRATION ON A SPECIFIC AIRFRAME USING A VARIETY OF NONDESTRUCTIVE MATERIALS MEASUREMENTS.

JVD IS PARTICULARLY POWERFUL FOR DEPOSITION OF MULTICOMPONENT FILMS SUCH AS PZT AND RELATED FERROELECTRICS, FOR WHICH CONTROL OF INDIVIDUAL METAL FLUXES IS MOST VALUABLE. ACCORDINGLY, WE PROPOSE IN PHASE I TO EQUIP OUR JVD APPARATUS WITH A SENSITIVE, RELIABLE AND FAST OPTICAL TECHNIQUE, ATOMIC ABSORPTION, IN ORDER TO MONITOR GAS PHASE METAL ATOM CONCENTRATIONS IN THE EMERGING JET. IN OUR \"LOW VACUUM\" JETS, THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO A FLUX MEASUREMENT AND RELATES DIRECTLY TO DEPOSITION RATE. THE ABSORBANCE WILL BE MEASURED VIA GAS SHIELDED OPTICAL FIBER BUNDLES POSITIONED ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE JET. OUR GOAL IS TO USE THE INSTANTANEOUS VALUES OF ABSORBANCE AS AN INPUT FOR REAL TIME FEEDBACK CONTROL OF JET SOURCE CONDITIONS AND HENCE DEPOSITION RATES. IN PHASE I WE WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING ATOMIC ABSORPTION TO TRACK METAL ATOM CONCENTRATIONS IN THE EMERGING JETS FOR THE SELECTED TEST CASES CU, BA, Y, TI AND AU. THESE TEST CASES ARE CONVENIENT FOR EXPERIMENTATION AND INCLUDE ELEMENTS OF IMPORTANT MULTICOMPONENT FILMS SUCH AS FERROELECTRICS AND HIGH T SUPERCONDUCTORS.
