THE VERY INTENSE, SHORT DURATION HEAVY ION BEAM PULSES FROM THE DRIVER MUST BE FOCUSED TO A VERY SMALL SPOT TO IGNITE A FUSION PELLET IN A REACTOR. CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO TAKE THE SPACE CHARGE OF THE BEAM INTO ACCOUNT WHEN DESIGNING A HEAVY ION DRIVER, PARTICULARLY IN THE BEAM TRANSPORT SYSTEM BETWEEN THE ACCELERATOR AND THE TARGET PELLET. MUCH THEORETICAL WORK HAS BEEN COMPLETED ON THE TRANSPORT AND FOCUSING OF THE HIGH CURRENT HEAVY ION BEAMS IN PROPOSED HEAVY ION DRIVER SYSTEMS. RECENT WORK AT LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY (LLNL) ON THE TARGET CONFIGURATION FOR HEAVY ION FUSION HAS REVEALED THAT WHEN THE TARGET PELLET IS HIT BY THE HEAVY ION BEAMS, THE PELLET SURFACE BECOMES HOT. RADIATION EMITTED FROM THE HOT SURFACECAN PHOTOIONIZE THE LATTER PART OF THE BEAM PULSE, CAUSING IT TO LOSE FOCUS AND MISS THE TARGET PELLET. THIS DETAILED PHASE I STUDY, CONDUCTED IN COLLABORATION WITH LLNL, WILL DESIGN A BEAM TRANSPORT AND FINAL FOCUSING SYSTEM FOR A HEAVY ION DRIVER. THE DESIGN WILL INCORPORATE CORRECTIONS FOR THE TIME-DEPENDENT DEFOCUSING OF THE HEAVY ION BEAM AT THE FINAL FOCAL POINT CAUSED BY THE INCREASED SPACE CHARGE. THE SOLUTION WILL BE VERIFIED BY MULTIPARTICLE BEAM DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; A SCALED PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE EXPERIMENT WILL BE PERFORMED IN PHASE II.",

A MAJOR PROBLEM HINDERING DEVELOPMENT OF MOMBE TECHNIQUES FOR GROWING GROUP III/V SEMICONDUCTORS IS THE AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATELY DESIGNED SOURCE REAGENTS THAT PERMIT EFFICIENT DECOMPOSITION IN THE REACTOR COUPLED WITH VOLATILITY AND PURITY THAT MAXIMIZE THE INHERENT BENEFITS OF THE PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY, LESS TOXIC REAGENTS ARE REQUIRED TO MINIMIZE THE DIFFICULT HANDLING PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF A RESINE IN OMVPE. THE FEASIBILITY IS BEING INVESTIGATED OF DEVELOPING A PROGRAM THAT WILL FACILITATE SCREENING OF A GROUP OF NOVEL SOURCE REAGENT COMPOUNDS THATHOLD HIGH PROMISE FOR MOMBE. SOURCES FOR CARBON-FREE INCORPORATION OF ALUMINUM AND GALLIUM ARE BEING IDENTIFIED, SYNTHESIZED, AND THEN EVALUATED IN A MOMBE REACTOR. PRELIMINARY LOW PRESSURE PYROLYSES OF ARSENIC SOURCE REAGENTS ARE BEING PERFORMED. USING THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA, A THEORY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE KINETICS AND PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION FROM THE LOW PRESSURE PYROLYSIS OF ALKYLARSINES IS BEING DEVELOPED THAT WILL PERMIT THE PREDICTION OF OPTIMUM SOURCE REAGENTS. IN A LATER EFFORT, THE OPTIMUM ELEMENT SOURCE REAGENTS WOULD BE PREPARED AND ALUMINUM GALLIUM ARSENIDE DEVICES PREPARED AND TESTED.",

IN ADDITION TO THE RAPID TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF THE LIGHT OUTPUT FROM SUCH SOURCES, THE INTENSITY USUALLY VARIES OVER AN EXTREMELY WIDERANGE REQUIRING A DETECTOR THAT NOT ONLY HAS A ULTRASHORT RESPONSE TIME, BUT ALSO HAS A HIGH, YET CONSTANT, SENSITIVITY. THE PHOTO-CONDUCTIVE RADIATION DETECTOR IS SIMPLE IN CONCEPT AND DESIGN COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL RADIATION DETECTORS. THE MOST HEAVILY STUDIED PHOTOCONDUCTORS FOR RADIATION DETECTION APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN SEMI-INSULATING SILICON, GALLIUM-ARSENIDE, AND INDIUM-PHOSPHIDE. THE MAIN LIMITATIONS OF THESE MATERIALS ARE THEIR LOW RADIATION RESISTANCE, LOW LEVELS OF MAXIMUM DCBIAS AND THERMAL RUNAWAY EFFECTS AT INCIDENT LIGHT INTENSITIES, DUE TO THEIR RELATIVELY LOW THERMAL CONDUCTIVITIES AND SMALL BANDGAPS. IN ORDER TO CIRCUMVENT THESE PROBLEMS, IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER SEMICONDUCTING MATERIALS WITH WIDER BANDGAPS AND LARGE DIELECTRIC STRENGTHSTHAT CAN SUPPORT HIGHER VOLTAGES. ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CANDIDATE PHOTOCONDUCTING MATERIALS IS DIAMOND BECAUSE OF ITS OVERWHELMINGLY SUPERIOR PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. IN THIS PROGRAM, THE PHOTOCONDUCTIVE RESPONSE OF DIAMOND FILMS GROWN BY PLASMA ASSISTED CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION IS BEING INVESTIGATED, AND EDITOR POTENTIAL FOR ULTRAFAST PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY RADIATION DETECTION APPLICATIONS IS BEING ASSESSED. WHEN SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED, ULTRAFAST RADIATION REDUCTION TECHNOLOGY WOULD HAVE APPLICATION IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS TESTING, AS WELL AS LASER DRIVEN FUSION SYSTEMS AND SPACEBORNE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS.

THIS PROPOSAL SUGGESTS THAT THE MANIPULATION AND PLACEMENT OF STREAMWISE VORTICITY IN THE FLOWFIELD WILL SERVE TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE MIXING OF THE EXHAUST PLUMES. THE PLACEMENT OF VORTICITY HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AND MAY BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH SEVERAL MEANS. STREAMWISE VORTICITY RESULTING FROM RESIDUAL SWIRL CREATED BY THE ENGINE TURBOMACHINERY, THROUGH THE USE OF NOZZLE WALL CONTOURING, MAY BE PLACED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CREATE WELL DEFINED STREAMWISE VORTICES. MODIFICATION OF THE FINAL TURBINE STATOR BLADE ROW MAY BE USED TO PLACE STREAMWISE VORTICITY IN THE EXHAUST PLUME. FINALLY, FORCING THE SEPARATION OF THE BOUNDARY LAYER WHICH FORMS ON THE NOZZLE WALL MAY BE USED TO MANIPULATE EXISTING VORTICITY IN THE FLOW TO CREATE AXIAL VORTICES.

THIS PROPOSAL WOULD DEVELOP AN OPTICAL TECHNIQUE FOR THE CONVENIENT MEASUREMENT OF CARBON ISOTOPIC ((13)C/(12)C) RATIOS.

SPECTRAL PROCESSING ALGORITHMS WILL BE APPLIED TO REMOVE SPECTRAL INTERFERENCES AND TO CORRECT FOR APPARENTISOTOPIC RATIO SHIFTS DUE TO VARIATIONS IN SAMPLE PRESSURE AND POWER COUPLING. IN THIS PHASE I STUDY, THE OPTIMAL BANDHEADS FOR ISOTOPIC RATIO DETERMINATION USING THE CO MOLECULE WILL BE IDENTIFIED. THE CRITERIA WILL INCLUDE A MINIMAL CONTAMINATION FROM OTHER TRANSITIONS OF THE (12)C ISOTOPE. DIFFERENT EXCITATION SOURCES AND SAMPLE PREPARATION TECHNIQUES WILL BE STUDIED WITH THE INTENT OF COUPLING THE INSTRUMENT TO AN AUTOMATED CARBON-NITROGEN ANALYZER IN PHASE II WORK. THE OUTCOME OF THE PHASE I EFFORT IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE THEISOTOPE RATIO OF CARBON TO A PRECISION OF 0.01 PERCENT OR 0.1 SIGMA UNIT WHICH WOULD MAKE THE METHOD APPLICABLE TO BOTH NATURAL ABUNDANCE STUDIES AND TRACER ADDITION STUDIES.

ALTHOUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN SCINTILLATOR CRYSTAL TECHNOLOGY HAVE EXTENDED THE UTILITY OFSCINTILLATOR SYSTEMS, SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES IN THE OPTICAL DETECTORS USED WITH SCINTILLATION CRYSTALS LIMIT THE TECHNOLOGY'S FULL POTENTIAL. CONVENTIONAL SCINTILLATION SYSTEMS USE PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES OR SILICON DIODES AS OPTICAL DETECTORS. UNFORTUNATELY, BOTH OF THESE OPTICAL DETECTOR SYSTEMS HAVE SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES IN TERMS OF QUANTUM EFFICIENCY AND SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO. IT WAS DEMONSTRATED VERY RECENTLY THAT PHOTOCONDUCTIVE DETECTORS CONSTRUCTED FROM WIDE BAND GAP SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS PRODUCE THE HIGHEST PERFORMANCE YET ACHIEVED WITH A SCINTILLATION SYSTEM. THESE RESULTS WERE OBTAINED BY COUPLING HGI2 PHOTODETECTORS TO CSI(TI) SCINTILLATORS. A NEW TYPE OF WIDE BAND GAP PHOTODETECTOR WILL BE DEVELOPED INTHIS STUDY. IT SHOULD OFFER PERFORMANCE SUPERIOR TO HGI2 PHOTODETECTORS AND BE USABLE WITH A WIDER RANGE OF SCINTILLATOR CRYSTALS. THESE PHOTOCONDUCTIVE DETECTORS, CONSTRUCTED FROM THE WIDE BAND GAP MATERIAL TIBRXI1-X WOULD BE VERY USEFUL IN THE WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS IN WHICH SCINTILLATION DETECTORS CURRENTLY ARE USED.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING NEW APPROACHES FOR RAPID PORTAL IMAGING IN RADIATION THERAPY IS THE SCANNING SYSTEM UNDER DEVELOPMENT AT JOHNS HOPKINS MEDICAL SHCOOL. THIS SYSTEM USES A LINEAR ARRAY OF DIODES TO GENERATE AN IMAGE AND HAS SEVERAL APPEALING ASPECTS, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE AN IMAGE IN REAL TIME. THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH THE DIODE-ARRAY SCANNING SYSTEM AS IT NOW EXISTS IS THAT ITS INHERENT DETECTION SENSITIVITY IS INSUFFICIENT TO ALLOW A USEFUL IMAGE TO BE CONSTRUCTED IN UNDER 30 SECONDS. THIS SLOW RESPONSE TIME RESULTS IN THE IMAGE BEING AVAILABLEONLY AT OR NEAR THE COMPLETION OF THE TREATMENT, TOO LATE TO ALLOW ANY NECESSARY REPOSITIONING OF THE PATIENT DURING THE TREATMENT SESSION. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE KEY TO INCREASING THE RESPONSE SPEED OF THIS IMAGING SYSTEM LIES IN IMPROVING THE SENSITIVITY OF THE DETECTORS. THEREFORE, A MODIFIED SCANNER WILL BE DEVELOPED USING CADMIUM TELLURIDE PHOTOVOLTAIC NUCLEAR DETECTORS THAT MAY ACHIEVE AN INCREASE IN PERFORMANCE OF AT LEAST AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. PHASE I EFFORTS WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE DETECTOR ASPECTS OF THE SYSTEM. IN PHASE II, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DETECTORS WILL BE COMPLETED AND AN ARRAY OF THE NEW SENSORS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO A FULLY FUNCTIONING PROTOTYPE IMAGING SYSTEM CAPABLE OF OBTAINING HIGH-QUALITY IMAGES.",

HOWEVER, THIS TECHNIQUE IS RESTRICTED IN APPLICATION BY THE LIMITED TIME WITHIN THE FURNACE FOR IFNR FUEL DISPERSION, REACTION WITH NOX AND BURNOUT. THE NOVEL PULSE COMBUSTOR IN-FURNACE NOX REDUCTION (PCIFNR) TECHNIQUE, TO BE EVALUATED DURING THIS PROGRAM, OVERCOMES THESE LIMITATIONS BY UTILIZING PULSATING FLOW TO FLASH VOLATILIZE THE COAL AND DEVELOP A REACTIVE CHAR, RAPIDLY DISPERSE AND MIX REBURNING FUEL WITH THE FURNACE GASES, ENHANCE FUEL BURNOUT AND PREVENT TUBE DEPOSITS. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE THE DEVICE IS SIMPLE AND CONVERTS COMBUSTION ENERGY DIRECTLY TO FLOW MOMENTUM, SYSTEM COSTS ARE LOW. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PHASE I PROGRAM IS TO DEMONSTRATE, BY EXPERIMENTAL AND ANALYTICAL MEANS, IMPROVED NOX REDUCTION AT LOWER COSTS USING THE NOVEL PCIFNR TECHNIQUE. IN THE PHASE I EFFORT, AN EXISTING PULSE COMBUSTOR AND COAL COMBUSTION COMPUTER MODEL WILL BE USED TO ASSESS THE PCIFNR SYSTEM NOX REDUCTION AND BURNOUT PERFORMANCE.

THE SYSTEM ISDESIGNED TO REACH A TEMPERATURE OF 77K, BUT A SIMPLE MODIFICATION IS EXPECTED TO ALLOW COLD HEAD TEMPERATURES OF 10 TO 20K. PRELIMINARY SYSTEMS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT 10 WATTS (COOLING)/100 WATTS OF INPUT POWER IS A REASONABLE EFFICIENCY GOAL AS ARE 4 WATTS (COOLING)/LB AND 0.4 WATTS (COOLING)/CUBIC INCH. IN THIS EFFORT, A SINGLE STAGE OF THECOMPRESSOR IS BEING CONSTRUCTED AND TESTED TO DEMONSTRATE THE CAPABILITY OF COMPRESSING AN ELECTROCHEMICALLY INACTIVE GAS WITH AN ELECTROCHEMICAL COMPRESSOR. CRYOGEN PURIFICATION METHODS ARE ALSO BEING EXPLORED TO PROVIDE A CRYOCOOLER WITH SUFFICIENT ENDURANCE FOR LONG TERM MISSIONS. WHEN SUCCESSFUL, THE ELECTROCHEMICAL CRYOCOOLER WOULD PROVIDE A COMPACT, EFFICIENT AND HIGHLY RELIABLE SYSTEM FOR USE IN BOTH LONG AND SHORT TERM MISSIONS.

THE APPARATUS INCORPORATED RELATIVELY LARGE PUMPING SPEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY 2,000 LITERS PER SECONDS. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO DECREASE THE PUMPING SPEED REQUIREMENTS OF ELECTROSPRAY IONIZATION SOURCES SO THAT THEYCAN BE FITTED TO QUADRUPOLE MASS SPECTROMETER SYSTEMS IN ACTUAL OR PROSPECTIVE USE. SUCH SYSTEMS TYPICALLY HAVE TOTAL PUMPING SPEEDS OF 700 LITERS PER SECOND OR LESS.

THE PRINCIPLE OBSTACLES TO HIGHER PERFORMANCE ARE: THE LARGE AMOUNTS OF IMAGE DATA TO BE PROCESSED; IMAGERS UNOPTIMIZED FOR THE VISION TASKS (TARGET DETECTION, CLASSIFICATION, RECOGNITION, IDENTIFICATION AND TRACKING); AND OPEN-LOOP SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE. IN THIS STUDY, A CLASS OF MUTUALLY OPTIMIZED IMAGERS AND IMAGE PROCESSING ALGORITHMS COLLECTIVELY CALLED FOVEAL VISION SYSTEMS ARE INVESTIGATED. THESE SYSTEMS, MODELED AFTER ADVANCED BIOLOGICAL VISION, FEATURE SPACE-VARIANT (VARIABLE RESOLUTION) IMAGER TOPOLOGIES AND A CLOSED-LOOP SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE. THE IMAGER TOPOLOGY IS CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH RESOLUTION SAMPLING AT THE CENTER OF THE SAMPLING PATTERN AXIS IS CONTROLLED BY FEEDBACK FROM THEIMAGE PROCESSING ALGORITHMS, ALLOWING THE ALLOCATION OF SAMPLING RESOURCES TO THE REGION(S) OF INTEREST AND RESULTING IN GREATER RELEVANT INFORMATION FROM THE IMAGER AT ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE REDUCTION IN DATA. CLOSED-LOOP OPERATION ALSO PERMITS THE FOVEAL VISION SYSTEM TO ADAPTIVELY OPTIMIZE ITS PERFORMANCE TO THE GIVEN VISION TASKS. IMAGER TOPOLOGIES WITH DIFFERENT SAMPLING ELEMENT GEOMETRIES, CORE CONFIGURATIONS, AND RESOLUTIONS ROLL-OFF FUNCTIONS ARE INVESTIGATED WITH DIFFERENT FEEDBACK CONTROL FUNCTION (BAYESIAN LEARNING, MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD, NON-PARAMETRIC). THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH OVERALL VISION SYSTEM PERFORMANCE IS BEING ASSESSED. WHEN FULLY DEVELOPED,THE CLASS OF COMPUTER VISION SYSTEMS CAN PERFORM HIGHER LEVEL VISION TASKS THAN CONVENTIONAL VISION SYSTEMS, WITH LESS PROCESSING TIME, HARDWARE, AND DATA. SYSTEM PERFORMANCE COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED THROUGH ADAPTIVE SENSOR AND PROCESSING RESOURCE ALLOCATION. ...

THIS APPROACH HAS BEEN TERMED \"METHIONINE-DEPENDENT CHEMOTHERAPY\". TO BRING METHIONINE-DEPENDENT CHEMOTHERAPY CLOSER TO CLINICAL TRIALS, ANTICANCER, INC. PROPOSES TO ISOLATE A METHIONINASE THAT, UPON ADMINISTRATION TO THE ANIMAL OR PATIENT, WILL ALLOW THE MODULATION OF CIRCULATING LEVELS OF METHIONINE. THE BACTERIA ALCALIGENES FAECALIS AND PSEUDOMONAS PSEUDOALCALIGENES, WHICH CONTAIN A METHIONINASE THAT APPARENTLY DOES NOT CLEAVE HOMOCYSTEINE, HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. STATE-OF-THE-ART GENETIC SELECTION AND PROTEIN PURIFICATION PROCEDURES WILL BE USED TO ISOLATE A METHIONINASE WITH A LOW KM, A LONG HALF-LIFE IN THE CIRCULATION, AND A LOW TOXICITY FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL ANIMAL OR HUMAN PATIENT. THE METHIONINE-CLEAVING PROPERTIES, HALF-LIFE, AND TOXICITY OF THE ENZYME WILL BE TESTED IN RATS. PURIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A DESIRABLE ENZYME IN PHASE I WILL LEAD TO CLONING THE METHIONINASE GENEIN PHASE II.",

KEY TO THIS PROGRAM ARE THE USE OF AN ENCAPSULANT LAYER TO ARREST SURFACE DECOMPOSITION AND A HIGHLY-STABLE INTERMEDIATE DEGENERATE SEMICONDUCTOR CONTACT SYSTEM DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE CONTACT FAILURE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES. THIS METHOD IS SUPERIOR TO OTHER INP HIGH TEMPERATURE APPROACHES BECAUSE IT COMBINES EXISTING EXPERIENCE IN THE THREE TECHNICAL AREAS: PROPRIETARY ENCAPSULANT, INTERMEDIATE SEMICONDUCTOR LAYER (ISL) CONTACTS, AND A PRECISE INP SOLAR CELL MODEL. STABLE ENCAPSULATION OF INP AT 600 DEGREES CELSIUS HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED, AND HIGH TEMPERATURE CONTACTS TO GAAS AT 600 DEGREES CELSIUS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED USING THE INTERMEDIATE SEMICONDUCTOR LAYER APPROACH. WITH A SUITABLE SURFACE ENCAPSULANT, THE INTERMEDIATE SEMICONDUCTORLAYER APPROACH IS EXPECTED TO LEAD TO THE BEST HIGH TEMPERATURE PERFORMANCE BECAUSE IT USES A BASE METAL LAYER WHICH FORMS A SEMICONDUCTOR RATHER THAN ALLOYING WITH THE INP.

        "abstract": "Abstract         IT IS PROPOSED TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE AN ARCHITECTURE FOR A MULTIELEMENT RADAR RECEIVING ARRAY WHICH PERFORMS DIGITAL BEAM FORMING (DBF) WITHIN THE RECEIVING ARRAY ITSELF, USING EACH ELEMENT AS A NODE OF A SYSTOLIC-LIKE ARRAY PROCESSOR. THE PROCESSOR ASSOCIATED WITH EACH ELEMENT OF THE ARRAY WILL PRODUCE A DIFFERENT SPATIAL BEAM. THIS DISTRIBUTED ARRAY PROCESSING CAPABILITY CAN BE REALIZED BY ADDING A SMALL AMOUNT OF DIGITAL CIRCUITRY TO EACH ELEMENT AND BY PROVIDING ELEMENT-TO-ELEMENT INTERCONNECTION IN A NOVEL AND EFFICIENT MANNER WHICH MINIMIZED INTERCONNECTION WIRING. THIS APPROACH CONTRASTS WITH CONVENTIONAL DBF ARCHITECTURES WHICH PERFORM ONLY QUANTIZATION AT EACH ELEMENT. THE QUANTIZED DATA FROM EACH ELEMENT IS PASSED TO A CENTRAL PROCESSOR FOR WEIGHTING AND SUMMING. THE HIGH AGGREGATE DATA RATE OFTEN REQUIRES A LARGE NUMBER OF PARALLEL DATA LINES. THE PROPOSED APPROACH PERMITS THE TRANSMITTED DATA TO BE REDUCED TO ONLY THOSE SPATIAL BEAMS OF CURRENT INTEREST, THEREBY REDUCING THE REQUIRED DATA RATE. THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION EFFORT WILL INCLUDE ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT OF THIS DBF APPROACH FOR SURVEILLANCE AND MULTI-TARGET TRACKING APPLICATIONS, AS WELL AS REFINEMENT OF THE BASIC ARCHITECTURAL CONCEPT TO ACCOMMODATE THE BROADEST POSSIBLE RANGE OF APPLICATION SCENARIOS. SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF BASIC SYSTEM FEASIBILITY WILL LEAD TO THE DESIGN AND EVENTUAL FABRICATION OF APPROPRIATE CUSTOM VLSI PROCESSOR ELEMENTS.",

THE ADAPTIVE CROSS-MODELING APPROACH SEEKS TO ESTIMATE THE CLUTTER RETURNS IN LOW FREQUENCY, LOW RESOLUTION FOLIAGE PENETRATING SAR DATA, BY USING HIGHER RESOLUTION SAR IMAGERY OF THE SAME GROUND AREA COLLECTED AT A HIGHER, NON-FOLIAGE-PENETRATING, RADAR FREQUENCY. OUR INITIAL PROPOSED TECHNIQUE OPERATES ON COMPLEX IMAGERY (AMPLITUDE AND PHASE), AND MODELS THE CLUTTER RETURNS IN EACH (LARGE) RESOLUTION CELL OF THE LOW FREQUENCY IMAGE AS A SCALED AND BLURRED VERSION OF THE MEASURED CLUTTER DATA IN A CONTIGUOUS GROUPING OF (SMALLER) RESOLUTION CELLS OF THE HIGH FREQUENCY DATA, COVERING THE SAME GROUND PATCH. SCALING OF THE CLUTTER RETURNS FROM ONE FREQUENCY TO THE OTHER IS DEPENDENT ON CLUTTER TYPE, WHICH IN TURN IS ASSESSED USING IMAGE PROCESSING ALGORITHMS OF THE TYPE DEVELOPED FOR TERRAIN CLASSIFICATION, AND MODIFIED FOR APPLICATION TO SAR DATA. THE PHASE I PROPOSAL INCLUDES DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTI-FREQUENCY SAR SIMULATION CAPABILITY TO SUPPORT PRELIMINARY ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT, PLUS IMPLEMENTATION AND PRELIMINARY FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT OF THE BASIC CROSS-MODELING APPROACH. REFINEMENT OF THE CLUTTER SUPPRESSION ALGORITHMS AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF TARGET DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES APPROPRIATE TO THE CLUTTER-REDUCED DATA ARE PROJECTED FOR PHASE II, PENDING SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PHASE I TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES.",

UTILIZATION OF DNA PROBES LABELED WITH DOZENS OF STABLE ISOTOPES INSTEAD OF A SINGLE RADIOISOTOPE COULD INCREASE THE RATE OF SEQUENCE DETERMINATION 100-FOLD OR MORE COMPARED TO CURRENT METHODS. THIS PROJECT INVOLVES A NEW APPROACH, LASER ATOMIZATION RESONANCE IONIZATION SPECTROSCOPY (LARIS), TO LOCALIZE AND QUANTIFY THE ISOTOPES IN DNA FRAGMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED BY POLYACRYLAMIDE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS. THE UNIQUE SELECTIVITY AND ULTIMATE SENSITIVITY MADE POSSIBLE BY THE LARIS TECHNIQUE ALLOWS DETECTION OF ISOTOPE TAGGED DNA FRAGMENTS IN THE 10(-18) MOLE OR LOWER RANGE WITHOUT ISOBARIC AND OTHER INTERFERENCES. THIS TECHNIQUE CAN BE APPLIED NOT ONLY TO GENOME SEQUENCING BUT ALSO TO HYBRIDIZATION METHODS USED IN GENETIC ENGINEERING. THIS PROJECT WILL USE THE SAME EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS AS IN THE ONGOING SPUTTER INITIATED RESONANCE IONIZATION SPECTROSCOPY (SIRIS) DNA SEQUENCING MEASUREMENTS.

THE MAJOR CLINICAL CHROMIUM EVALUATIONPROBLEM IS THE ASSESSMENT OF CHROMIUM STATUS. DETERMINATIONOF CHROMIUM STATUS HAS BEEN DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF ITS EXTREMELY LOW BIOLOGICAL LEVELS AND THE LACK OF RELIABLE BODY FLUID OR TISSUE TO ASSESS CHROMIUM STATUS. IN PHASE I, SKIN WAS POSTULATED AS A POTENTIALLY RELEVANT TISSUE TO ASSESS CHROMIUM STATUS. RESONANCE IONIZATION SPECTROSCOPY WAS USED TO DEMONSTRATE FEMTOGRAM SENSITIVITIESFOR CHROMIUM AND TO DETERMINE CHROMIUM CONCENTRATIONS RELIABLY IN SKIN BIOPSIES.

BECAUSE YEASTS GROW SLOWLY, IT IS DIFFICULT BUT IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP RAPID METHODS FOR THEIR IDENTIFICATION. BIOLOG HOLDS TWO PATENTS ON A NEW REDOX METHOD WHICH IDENTIFIES AN ORGANISM BASED ON PATTERNS OF CARBON SOURCE UTILIZATION. THE METHOD EMPLOYS A TETRAZOLIUM DYE TO COLORIMETRICALLY INDICATE CARBON SOURCE OXIDATIONS. PRINCIPAL ADVANTAGES OF THE METHOD ARE: (1)SPEED--FOR MOST MICROORGANISMS TESTS CAN BE COMPLETED IN UNDER 4 HOURS, (2) SIMPLICITY--THIS IS AN EASY TO INOCULATE AND READ SINGLE COLOR CHEMISTRY, AND (3) ACCURACY--DRAWING FROM THOUSANDS OF POTENTIAL CARBON SOURCESSHOULD ENABLE US TO DEVELOP A TEST PANEL THAT IS FAR MORE ACCURATE THAN ANYTHING PRESENTLY AVAILABLE. THIS PHASE I STUDY WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A RAPID AND ACCURATE SPECIATION KIT FOR YEASTS. TWO TASKS ARE INVOLVED: (1) THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUSPENSION MEDIUM COMPATIBLE WITH THE REDOX CHEMISTRY WHICH IS TAILOREDTO THIS DIVERSE GROUP OF YEASTS, AND (2) A SURVEY OF 380 POTENTIAL TEST SUBSTRATES TO DEMONSTRATE THAT NEW AND USEFUL SPECIATION TESTS CAN BE FOUND BASED ON CARBON SOURCE OXIDATION REACTIONS. THE POTENTIAL MARKET FOR THESE KITS ISLARGE, AND INCLUDES HOSPITAL, PUBLIC HEALTH, AND CLINICAL LABORATORIES.",

SPECIFIC AIMS INCLUDED SELECTION OF A BASAL MEDIUM SUPPORTIVE OF CLONAL GROWTH IN LIMITING SERUM CONCENTRATIONS, REPLACEMENT OF SERUM BY SELECTED GROWTH FACTORS AND HORMONES, OPTIMIZATION OF SUPPLEMENTS BY CLONAL TITRATIONS, AND COMPARISON OF GROWTH CHARACTERISTICS IN SERUM-FREE AND CONVENTIONAL SERUM-SUPPLEMENTED MEDIA. THE SELECTED BASAL MEDIUM (DME/F-12) SUPPORTS CLONAL GROWTH OF SECONDARY SHE CELLS IN 1-PERCENT SERUM (FBS) WITHOUT FEEDER CELLS. AN INTERIM SERUM-FREE FORMULATION (DME/F-12, INSULIN, TRANSFERRIN, EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR, SELENIUM, ASCORBIC ACID, BOVINE PITUITARY EXTRACT (BPE)) SUPPORTS CLONAL GROWTH WITH 3.8-PERCENT COLONY-FORMING EFFICIENCY (CFE). CLONAL TITRATION AND ADDITION/DELETION EXPERIMENTS HAVE PROVIDED SEVERAL CLUES CONCERNING STIMULATORY AND INHIBITORY FACTORS IN FBS.

SINCE THE SQUID IS THE MOST SENSITIVE DETECTOR OF MAGNETIC FLUX KNOWN, THERE ARE INNUMERABLE APPLICATIONS RANGING FROM MAGENTOENCEPHALOGRAPHY (MEG) TO MAGNETIC ANOMALY DETECTION. PRESENTLY, SQUIDS MUST BE COOLED TO 4 K IN ORDER TO OPERATE. USE OF THE NEW HIGH-TC SUPERCONDUCTORS WOULD ALLOW OPERATION AT A WIDE VARIETY OF TEMPERATURES RANGING FROM ABOVE 77 K TO BELOW 10 K; THE TEMPERATURE OF OPERATION CAN BE SELECTED FOR OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE AND COOLING COST. THE KEY COMPONENT IN CONVENTIONAL SQUIDS IS A JOSEPHSON TUNNEL JUNCTION, WHICH WILL NOT BE EASY TO FABRICATE IN THE NEW PEROVSKITE SUPERCONDUCTORS DUE TO THEIR VERY SHORT SUPERCONDUCTING COHERENCE LENGTH AND THEIR PRESENT NEED FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE HEAT TREATMENT.

IT REDUCES CHANNEL RELIABILITY AND LIMITS GENERATOR LIFETIME. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO ELIMINATE INTERANODE ARCING. WHEN AN INTERANODE VOLTAGE EXCEEDS APPROXIMATELY 50 TO 60 V,ARCING IS LIKELY TO OCCUR. THIS ARC IS DRIVEN BY THE LORENTZ FORCE INTO THE INTERANODE SPACE, WHERE IT CUTS THE INSULATOR AND ERODES THE ELECTRODES. THIS \"FAULT\" CONDITIONHAS A TENDENCY TO PROPAGATE UPSTREAM, ULTIMATELY CAUSING CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE. THUS, A FAST, AUTONOMOUS, PASSIVE DEVICE IS NEEDED TO ACT AS AN INTERANODE \"ELECTRICAL SAFETY VALVE\". THIS DEVICE WOULD CLAMP THE INTERANODE VOLTAGE AT ASAFE LEVEL. VOLTAGE CLAMPING NORMALLY IS ACCOMPLISHED BY CERAMIC DEVICES KNOWN AS SURGE ARRESTORS. THOSE THAT ARE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE HAVE NEITHER THE DESIRED VOLTAGE-CURRENT (V-1) CHARACTERISTIC NOR THE CAPABILITY TO ABSORB LARGE ENERGY. THESE CERAMIC DEVICES WILL BE MODIFIEDSO THAT THEY CAN MAINTAIN APPROXIMATELY 60 V INTERANODE VOLTAGE WHILE CONTINUALLY PASSING UP TO 40 A OF CURRENT. ATA VOLTAGE BELOW 40 V THE DEVICE WILL LIMIT THE CURRENT TO LESS THAN 0.1 A SO THAT, UNDER NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS, THE POWER LOSS IS NEGLIGIBLE. DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE DEVICES AND BENCH-TOP TESTING USING A DC POWER SUPPLY WILL BE PERFORMED IN PHASE I. USING THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THESE TESTS, A PROTOTYPICAL DESIGN OF MHD-CAPABLE DEVICES WILL BE DEVELOPED. IN PHASE II, THE PROTOTYPES WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND DEMONSTRATED ON THE MARK 7 MHD CHANNEL AT AVCO RESEARCH LABORATORY/TEXTRON.

THE ELECTRODE PAIRS HAVE SUCCESSIVELY FINER PATTERNS, AND EACH IS CONNECTED TO A COMPARATOR CIRCUIT. AS A CHARGE BURST TRAVERSES THE STACK, IT ENCOUNTERS AT EACH SURFACE ONE ELECTRODE OF THE PAIR, DETERMINING ONE DIGIT OF A GRAY BINARY CODE. EACH MCP RESTORES LOST CHARGE, AND THE BURST FINALLY STRIKES A COLLECTION PLATE, PROVIDING A STROBE PULSE TO READ OUT THE COMPARATORS. FOR 2(N) PIXELS, ONLY N COMPARATORS AND N/2 MCPS ARE REQUIRED.

THE FIELD ARMY FOR OPERATION OF THEIR ROWPU (REVERSE OSMOSIS WATER PURIFICATION UNITS) WANTS A PRACTICAL MEANS OF SDI MEASUREMENT THAT IS FAST, ACCURATE, AND FACILE. EXISTING AUTOMATED FILTER PLUGGING MONITORS HAVE PROVEN THEIR VALUE IN ESTIMATING FOULING POTENTIAL, BUT THE USE OF FILTER TAPE IN THESE MONITORS HAS INCREASED THEIR MECHANICAL COMPLEXITY, INCREASED THEIR COST, AND DECREASED THEIR FLEXIBILITY TO UTILIZE ALTERNATE FILTER TYPES. SEVERAL NOVEL APPROACHES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MORE PRACTICAL, ACCURATE, AND FLEXIBLE AFPA (AUTOMATED FILTER PLUGGING ANALYZER) WILL BE INVESTIGATED. SUCCESSFUL USE OF DISPOSABLE, READY-TO-USE FILTER MODULES FOR SDI MEASUREMENT WOULD ELIMINATE THE AFOREMENTIONED DISADVANTAGES OF FILTER TAPE. MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS OF THE ENTIRE FILTRATION FLOW DECLINE CURVE WOULD ALLOW THE SDI DETERMINATION TO BE COMPLETED FASTER AND PROVIDE SDI ERROR ESTIMATES. HIGH FILTRATION PRESSURE AND SELECTION OF ALTERNATE FILTER TYPES COULD ALSO INCREASE SDI ANALYSIS SPEED AND ACCURACY. A PRACTICAL, INEXPENSIVE AFPA WOULD HAVE WIDE APPLICABILITY TO HELP MAKE RO WATER PRODUCTION MORE EFFICIENT AND ECONOMICAL.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         SOLID-STATE LASER SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE TRANSMITTER TECHNOLOGY FOR USE IN COHERENT LASER RADAR SYSTEMS, DUE TO THEIR NEAR-IR WAVELENGTH (1-2UM), COMPACTNESS, FREQUENCY AGILITY, AND EFFICIENCY. RECENT ADVANCES IN LASER DIODE ARRAY TECHNOLOGYHAVE OPENED NEW PROSPECTS FOR LONG LIFE, HIGH ENERGY AND AVERAGE POWER SOLID-STATE LASER RADAR INSTRUMENTS SUITABLE FOR EXTENDED, UNATTENDED USE IN SPACE. IN THIS STUDY, THE ND:YAG MASTER OSCILLATOR, POWER AMPLIFIER (MOPA) LASER RADARCONFIGURATION HAS BEEN SELECTED AS THE \"BEST FORM\" SYSTEM FOR STRATEGIC APPLICATIONS. FEASIBILITY OF A MOPA MULTIPLE-PASS SLAB AMPLIFIER WITH THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS IS BEING INVESTIGATED: DIFFRACTION-LIMITED OPTICAL PERFORMANCE, EFFICIENT DIODE-ARRAY PUMPED OPERATION,AND HIGH AVERAGE POWER CAPABILITY. THE STEPS TO ACHIEVING THIS GOAL FIRST INVOLVE THE SPECIFICATION AND PROCUREMENT OFA HIGH PERFORMANCE MINIATURE ND:YAG AMPLIFIER SLAB CAPABLE OF VERY LOW DISTORTION OPERATION. ONCE FABRICATED, THE HIGHPERFORMANCE SLAB WILL BE FULLY CHARACTERIZED IN AN EXISTING FLASHLAMP-PUMPED MULTIPLE-PASS AMPLIFIER TEST FIXTURE TO PROVIDE DATA NECESSARY FOR THE OPTIMIZATION OF AN ALL-SOLID-STATE SLAB AMPLIFIER. DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE DIODE-PUMPED VERSION IS BEING INITIATED WITH A GOAL OF PROVIDING A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR THE FULLY DIODE-PUMPED AMPLIFIER DEVELOPMENT IN LATER RESEARCH. THE DEVELOPMENT OFAN ALL-SOLID-STATE COHERENT LASER RADAR SYSTEM IS A VITAL LINK IN THE CHAIN OF TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRED FOR STRATEGIC DEFENSE AND TARGET RECOGNITION APPLICATIONS. A MULTIPLE-PASS, VERY HIGH GAIN SLAB AMPLIFIER HAVING DIFFRACTION-LIMITED PERFORMANCE MUST BE DEVELOPED TO ACHIEVETHIS GOAL IN THE NEAR TERM. COMMERCIAL AND RESEARCH APPLICATIONS FOR A HIGH PERFORMANCE SLAB AMPLIFIER INCLUDE SPECTROSCOPY, COMMUNICATIONS, AND METEDOROLOGICAL RESEARCH. TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED IN THIS EFFORT WOULD ALSO BE APPLICABLETO EYESAFE AND BROADLY TUNABLE SOLID-STATE MATERIALS.",

THESE FINDINGS MAY BE ABLE TO BE EXTENDED TO OTHER ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS. THE APPLICATION FOR AN ULTRA-HARD CRYSTAL IS IN PORTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO ROUGH USAGE (E.G., INTENSE SHOCK). WRIST WATCHES, WALKIE-TALKIE, AND SMALL RADIOS ARE EXAMPLES. THESE DEVICES, AND OTHERS LIKE THEM, CURRENTLY MAKE USE OF THE HARDEST CRYSTALS AVAILABLE, THAT OFTEN ARE FURTHER PROTECTED BY MECHANICAL SHOCK AND VIBRATION ISOLATION SCHEMES REQUIRING RELATIVELY LARGE VOLUME (SWAY SPACE).

        "abstract": "Abstract         TODAY AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CFD CALCULATIONS ARE DONE WITH STANDARD FIXED GRID FINITE DIFFERENCE METHODS. HOWEVER, A SIMPLE CALCULATION CAN ESTABLISH THAT SUCH METHODS CANNOT POSSIBLY EXPLOIT THE FULL COMPUTING POWER OF TODAY'S COMPUTING EQUIPMENT NOR CAN THEY DELIVER HIGHLY ACCURATE SIMULATIONS OF FINE SCALE FLOW PHENOMENA IN COMPLEXFLOW DOMAINS. TO FULLY EXPLOIT CONTEMPORARY COMPUTING CAPABILITIES, NEW AND INNOVATIVE COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURES MUST BE DEVELOPED THAT ARE BASED ON CONCEPTS WHICH REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURES FROM CONVENTIONAL FD FLOW SOLVERS. IN THE PRESENT PROPOSAL, A PROJECT IS OUTLINED WHICH WILL HAVE AS ITS ULTIMATE GOAL THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW FAMILY OF CFD CODES THAT CAN BE USED TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS A VARIETY OF VERY COMPLEX FLOW PROBLEMS THAT ARE NOT TREATED SATISFACTORILY WITH EXISTING METHODS. THESE NEW METHODS ARE BUILT AROUND TWO BASIC IDEAS: 1) THE USE OF NEW OPERATOR-SPLITTING TECHNIQUES THAT PROVIDE SPECIAL HIGH-ORDER SCHEMES FOR THE CONVECTION AND DIFFUSION STEPS IN AN UNSTEADY NAVIER-STOKES CALCULATION AND2) THE USE OF SPECIAL H-P ADAPTIVE SCHEMES ON UNSTRUCTURED GRIDS. THE PHASE I PROJECT IS TO FOCUS ON DEVELOPING OPERATOR-SPLITTING METHODS FOR EULER EQUATIONS ON UNSTRUCTURED GRIDS WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION GIVEN TO EXPLICIT METHODS SECOND-ORDER ACCURATE IN TIME. RELIABLE A-POSTERIORI ERROR ESTIMATORS WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT WILL PROVIDE A BASIS FOR H-P ADAPTIVITY, I.E. A SOLUTION ADAPTIVESCHEME WILL BE DEVISED WHICH WILL ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE AN OPTIMAL APPROXIMATION BY SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASING A LOCAL SPECTRAL ORDER OF THE APPROXIMATION AS WELL AS DECREASING THE MESH SIZE.",

AN ADAPTIVE TECHNIQUE WILL THEN BE CALLED UPON TO PRE- PROCESS THE MESH BEFORE EXPENSIVE CALCULATION IS PERFORMED. POST-PROCESSING UNITS WILL USE DATA FROM A COMPUTED SOLUTION AND RIGOROUS A-POSTERIORI ERROR ESTIMATES TO PROVIDE ESTIMATES OF THE OVERALL QUALITY OF THE SOLUTION, AND BY USING EXTRACTION AND EXTRAPOLATION ROUTINES PROVIDE ENHANCEMENT OF SOLUTIONS OF IMPORTANT FLOW PROBLEMS.

THIS SYSTEM WILLBE BASED ON CYTO FLUIDICS' PATENTED \"FLUID TRANSISTOR\" WHICH ALLOWS MICROFABRICATION OF FLUID CONTROL VALVES IN SIZES AND DENSITIES AT THE LIMITS OF CURRENT LITHOGRAPHIC METHODS (2 UM). IN THE PROPOSED STUDY, CFI WILL TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF UTILIZING THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE \"ON CHIP\" SYSTEMS OF CAPILLARY CHANNELS AND HIGH-SPEED MICROVALVES TO CONTROL THE FLOW (POSITION) OF PARTICLES AND CELLS. THE PRIMARY AIMS OF PHASE I WILL BE: (1) TO DECREASE VALVE CYCLE TIMES SO AS TO INCREASE THE CELL SORTING RATE, (2) TO OPTIMIZE THE GEOMETRY OF THE MICRO-MACHINED FLOW CHANNELS TO MINIMIZE TURBULENCE AND CELL STRESS, AND (3) TO EVALUATE THE STOPPED-FLOW SORTING SYSTEM USING PARTICLES AND CELLS. USING DESIGN CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN PHASE I, THE PHASE II OBJECTIVE WOULD BE TO CREATE AN INEXPENSIVE FLOW CYTOMETER. CFI'S UNIQUE TECHNOLOGY COULD MAKE POSSIBLE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FUNCTIONS SUCH AS THE REAL-TIME INTRODUCTION OF REAGENTS INTO THE SINGLE CELL ENVIRONMENT, SECONDARY SORTING, HIGH SPEED ANALYSIS USING PARALLEL FLOW CHANNELS, AND THE COMBINATION OF FLOW CYTOMETRY AND HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGE ANALYSIS.",

MEDIMINDER IS A \"VOICE MAIL\" SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THE NEEDS OF THE ELDER PATIENT. ONCE TESTED AND VALIDATED IN PHASE TWO, IT WILL PROVIDE AN INEXPENSIVE, AUTOMATED SYSTEM TO PROVIDE THREE GENERAL TYPES OF SERVICES: A) PREVENTATIVE CARE \"SERVICE CALLS\" REMINDING ELDERS OF SUCH THINGS AS INFLUENZA VACCINATIONS, CANCER CHECK-UPS, AND APPOINTMENTS; B) \"FOLLOW-UP CALLS\" TO MONITOR RECOVERY AFTER SURGERY, SERIOUS ILLNESS, OR POSSIBLE ADVERSE DRUG AFFECTS; AND C) \"EMERGENCY ALERT CALLS\" WHEN SUDDEN LIFE THREATENING SITUATIONS OCCUR. THE MEDIMINDER SYSTEM HAS THREE COMPONENTS: A) MICROCOMPUTER SYSTEM, B) ADDITIONAL VOICE MAIL HARDWARE, AND C) CONTROLLING SOFTWARE. TO USE MEDIMINDER, THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER CREATES A VOCABULARY OF SPOKEN WORDS THAT ARE DIGITIZED AND STORED ON THE COMPUTER'S HARD DISK. USING THIS VOCABULARY THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER TYPES INSTRUCTIONS AND QUESTIONS AT THE KEYBOARD TO BE SENT, VIA MEDIMINDER TO THEIR PATIENTS. MEDIMINDER CONTACTS THESE PATIENTS AND \"SPEAKS\" THE QUESTIONS OR INSTRUCTIONS IN THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER'S VOICE. THE PATIENT RESPONDS BY PRESSING NUMBERS ON THE TELEPHONE NUMBER PAD. THE ESTIMATED RETAIL PRICE FOR MEDIMINDER WILL BE LESS THAN $10,000. THIS LOW PRICE MAKES POSSIBLE THE FOLLOWING THREE VERTICAL MARKETS: A) HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE, B) HEALTH CARE CLINICS, C) MEDICAL CENTERS AND HOSPITALS, AND D) ANY OTHER PRIVATE, STATE, OR FEDERAL HEALTH CARE SERVICE AGENCY.",

THE FIRST FEW LD CASES (ACTURALLY MORE THAN 50 IN THE SAME AREA) IN USA WERE DISCOVERED IN 1975; AND ITS ETIOLOGY (BORRELIA BURGDORFERI) AND MODE OF INFECTION (TICK BITES) WERE DETERMINED A FEW YEARS LATER. WITH THIS INFORMATION, DEFINED CLINICAL FEATURES AND SEROLOGIC TESTS AVAILABLE, LD HAS BEEN REPORTED IN INCREASING NUMBER WORLDWIDE. LD HAS 3 MAJOR CLINICAL STAGES LASTING 2 YEARS OR LONGER, WITH A NUMBER OF ITS SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS VERY SIMILAR TO MANY OTHER DISEASES. IT CAN BE CURED WITH ANTIBIOTICS. SEROLOGY PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF LD. THE SEROLOGIC TESTS AVAILABLE ARE DESIGNED FOR CLINICALLABORATORIES, WHICH ARE OFTEN NOT EASILY AVAILABLE IN SUBURBAN AND RURAL AREAS WHERE LD OCCURRS. A SIMPLE, QUICK,SAFE AND IN-EXPENSIVE SEROLOGIC TEST FOR LD WOULD ALLOW LD DIAGNOSED IN PHYSICIAN OFFICE OR SMALL CLINICAL LABORATORIESAND SPECIFICALLY TREATED EARLIER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY.

CURRENTLY, THE COST OF MAINTAINING AND REHABILITATING THE NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE IS VERY EXPENSIVE, THEREFORE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO USE STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS WHICH ARE DURABLE, EASILY MODIFIED ANDLIGHTWEIGHT. E.T. TECHTONICS PROPOSES TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEMBY USING A PRESTRESSED STRUCTURAL SYSTEM OF KEVLAR 49 AND E-GLASS POLYESTER RESIN. THESE MATERIALS HAVE EXCELLENT CORROSION RESISTANCE AS WELL AS BEING LIGHTWEIGHT. THE DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM EMPHASIZES THE LIGHTWEIGHT AND ADJUSTABLE STIFFNESS CHARACTERISTICS OBTAINED BY USING PRESTRESSING. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON THE TIME-DEPENDENT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BEAM ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM AND THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A COMPUTER MODEL WHICH CAN PREDICT THE BEHAVIOR OF THESE ELEMENTS. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL INVOLVE AN INVESTGATION INTO THREE MAJOR AREAS: MATERIALS, GEOMETRY, AND CONSTRUCTION.

THIS STRATEGY CALLS FOR REALISTIC, HIGH FIDELITY SIMULATIONS, AND HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN A VARIETY OF MILITARY APPLICATIONS. ALTHOUGH THE PHYSICAL FIDELITY OF A TRAINING SYSTEM CAN BE ATTAINED WITH GREAT PRECISION, THERE ARE NO DESIGN GUIDELINES AVAILABLE FOR EFFECTIVELY SIMULATING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF THE STRESS ENVIRONMENT.

IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE FPS CONNECTIONS COULD INCREASE THE EARTHQUAKE RESISTANCE OF BUILDINGS BY 100PERCENT TO 300 PERCENT, WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN CONSTRUCTION COSTS. THE CONNECTIONS COULD ALSO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE EARTHQUAKE RESISTANCE OF EXISTING BUILDINGS WITH LESS DISRUPTION AND AT A LOWER COST THAN OTHER METHODS.

IN ADDITION, THE TOXIC NATURE OF THESE MATERIALS REQUIRES THAT THEIR CONCENTRATIONS IN THE ENVIRONMENT BE MONITORED ATTHE PARTS-PER-BILLION LEVEL. THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SENSITIVE, \"REAL-TIME\" SENSOR FOR HYPERGOLIC GASES BASED ON SURFACE ENHANCED RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY (SERS). THE SERS SIGNAL, WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE VIBRATIONAL SPECTRUM OF A MOLECULE ADSORBED ONTO SPECIFIC METAL OR METAL OXIDE SUBSTRATES, IS OBTAINED FROM THE RAMAN SCATTERING OFF THE SUBSTRATE USING A VISIBLE LASER SOURCE. THE SERS TECHNIQUE CAN BE USED FOR THE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF NUMEROUS COMPONENTSIN BOTH GASEOUS AND LIQUID ENVIRONMENTS. THE GOAL OF THE PHASE I PROGRAM IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A RELIABLE SENSOR BASED ON SERS FOR THE \"REAL-TIME\" DETECTION OF HYDRAZINE AND MONOMETHYLHYDRAZINE.

THE TECHNICAL APPROACH CHOSEN FOR THIS SYSTEM IS TO EMPLOY VERY LARGE PROCESSING GAIN IN THE RECEIVER SO THAT THE TRANSMITTED SIGNAL POWER DENSITY IS WELL BELOW THERMAL NOISE. ONE METHOD OF ACHIEVING RECEIVER PROCESSING GAIN IS TO ENCODE THE TRANSMITTED SIGNAL (VOICE OR DATA) WITH A CODE WHICH SPREADS THE SIGNAL ACROSS A WIDER BANDWIDTH THAN WOULD BE NEEDED TO SEND THE DESIRED INFORMATION. THE RESULTING \"SPREAD SPECTRUM\" IS TRANSMITTED TO A RECEIVER WHICH DECODES OR \"COMPRESSES\" THE SIGNAL INTO ITS ORIGINAL FORM; THE AMOUNT OF COMPRESSION DETERMINES THE PROCESSING GAIN.

ELOQUENT TECHNOLOGY, INC. (ETI) PROPOSES A NOVEL MODULAR APPROACH TO RULE-BASED SPEECH SYNTHESIS COUPLED WITH A NEW SYNTHESIS MODEL THAT WILL LEAD TO COST-EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-QUALITY SYNTHETIC VOICES FOR THE NONSPEAKING. THE KEY TOOL IN THIS APPROACH IS DELTA, A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE DEVELOPED BY ETI FOR EXPRESSING TEXT-TO-SPEECH ALGORITHMS (RULES). IN THE MODULAR APPROACH, A SINGLE PROGRAM MODULE (THE BASE MODULE) BUILDS THE PART OF AN UTTERANCE REPRESENTATION COMMON TO ALLVOICES IN A GIVEN LANGUAGE; SMALLER, INDEPENDENT VOICE MODULES PRODUCE THE VARIATIONS AMONG THE VOICES. THE SYNTHESIS MODEL USES DELTA'S INNOVATIVE \"MULTI-STREAM\" DATA STRUCTURE FOR REPRESENTING UTTERANCES. IN THIS PHASE I PROJECT, WE WILL TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF THE MODULAR APPROACH BY IMPLEMENTING A BASE RULE SET FOR ENGLISH, AND VOICE MODULES FOR TWO AMERICAN DIALECTS.",

THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBES A RESEARCH PROGRAM THAT WILL DEMONSTRATE A SOLUTION TO THIS DILEMMA.

THE TECHNIQUE BEING EMPLOYED REPRESENTS PARALLEL DEVELOPMENTPATHS TO THOSE CURRENTLY PURSUED. THIS APPROACH INVOLVED OVERCOMING TWO FUNDAMENTAL CONSTRAINTS TO ENERGY DENSITY: THE INEVITABLE DERATING OF THE DIELECTRIC STRENGTH OF THE MATERIAL DUE TO DISCONTINUITIES IN THE METAL OR DIELECTRIC, AND THE EXTRA MATERIAL WHICH MUST BE ALLOWED AT THE EDGES OF THE CAPACITOR TO HOLD THE VOLTAGE AT THE EDGE. THE TECHNIQUES REQUIRE THAT THE CYCLE OF THE CAPACITOR BE PRESCRIBED. TRANSIENT VOLUME CHARGE DISTRIBUTIONS PREVENT FIELD ENHANCEMENT BOTH AT THE METALIZATION AND DIELECTRIC SURFACE.

THE DETECTION PRINCIPAL IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE ABSORBED INFRARED RADIATION REDUCES THE ENERGY GAP OF THE SUPERCONDUCTOR, MODIFYING THE CURRENT-VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS OF JOSEPHSON JUNCTION WHICH CAN SERVE AS A USEFUL DETECTOR OUTPUT. RECENTLY, IN A PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENT, WE HAVE OBSERVED FOR THE FIRST TIME, NOT ONLY A SLOW BOLOMETRIC RESPONSE BUT ALSO A FAST NON-THERMAL QUANTUM RESPONSE DUE TO COOPER PAIR BREAKING AND QUASI-PARTICLES GENERATION IN YBA-CU-O FILM SUBJECTED TO PULSED 532 NM LASER. IN THE PRESENT WORK, PRECISELY CONTROLLED SUPERCONDUCTING, INSULATING, AND SUPERCONDUCTING THIN FILMS OF BI-CA-SR-CU-O WILL BE DEPOSITED ON A SUITABLE SUBSTRATE BY PLASMA ASSISTED LASER DEPOSITION USING 265 NM UV LASER AT 10 HZ. SUBSEQUENT TO A DEPOSITION, SUPERCONDUCTING WEAK LINK SIS TYPE JOSEPHSON JUNCTION WILL BE FABRICATED BY PATTERNING THESE FILMS WITH 532 NM VISIBLE LASER A 1 KHZ. FOR DETECTION, INFRARED RADIATION FROM ND:YAG LASER AT 1.06 U WILL BE MODULATED AND GUIDED THROUGH AN OPTICALFIBER TO THE DETECTOR. IN THE PHASE I, NON-EQUILIBRIUM (QUANTUM) RESPONSE OF THE DETECTOR AT 1.06 U AND THE TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THE RESPONSE WILL BE STUDIED. THE RESPONSIVITY OF THE DETECTOR IS ESTIMATED TO BE \\ 10(4) V/W, WHICH IS SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN PRESENTLY AVAILABLE QUANTUM DETECTORS. IN PHASE II, WAVELENGTH DEPENDENCE OF THE RESPONSE IN THE 1-10 U REGION, HIGH FREQUENCY RESPONSE, AND THE TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THE RESPONSIVE TIME WILL BE INVESTIGATED.",

THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE OF ALL SUCH COMPOUNDS MUST BE ENTERED INTO A COMPUTER SYSTEM SO THAT THE COMPOUNDS CAN BE REGISTERED AGAINST PREVIOUSLY TESTED COMPOUNDS, AND SO THAT RECORDS OF THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE CAN BE SEARCHED AND DISPLAYED AS NECESSARY BY NCI, NCI CONTRACTOR, AND NCI SUPPLIER PERSONNEL. THIS CHEMICAL STRUCTURE INFORMATION IS PRESENTLY ENTERED MANUALLY BY CHEMISTS USING INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS TERMINALS. WITH RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE OPTICALSCANNER AND OCR (OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION) AREAS, IT ISBELIEVED THAT A SYSTEM CAN BE DEVELOPED TO READ CHEMICAL STRUCTURE INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM THE PAGES OF A TECHNICALJOURNAL (OR OTHER PUBLICATION) AND TO TRANSLATE AUTOMATICALLY SUCH INFORMATION INTO A CONNECTION TABLE FOR USE IN A CHEMICAL STRUCTURE ORIENTED COMPUTER SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED EFFORT IS INTENDED TO ASSESS IN DETAIL THE FEASIBILITY AND PRACTICALITY OF DEVELOPING SUCH A SYSTEM. OPTICAL SCANNERS, TOGETHER WITH OCR SOFTWARE, WILL BE EVALUATED FOR THIS APPLICATION. ALGORITHMS AND PROCEDURES FOR THE RECOGNITION OF VARIOUS STRUCTURAL FEATURES, AND FOR THE TRANSLATION OF THOSE FEATURES INTO A CONNECTION TABLE, WILL BE DEVELOPED. ASSESSMENTS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SYSTEM ON SELECTED PRINTED CHEMICAL STRUCTURES WILL BE MADE,AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FULL PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE GIVEN.",

SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS OF TROPICALPRECIPITATION PATTERNS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED USING SENSITIVE, SOPHISTICATED INFRARED AND MICROWAVE SYSTEMS. SOME OF THESEMEASUREMENTS MUST BE MADE AT SEA, WHERE SATELLITE INSTRUMENTATION IS MOST ACCURATE. INSTRUMENTS TO PERFORM THESE MEASUREMENTS MUST BE FLOWN ALOFT IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE SHIP INTERFERENCE EFFECTS, SEA SPRAY CONTAMINATION OF DATA, ETC. MEASUREMENTS ARE REQUIRED FOR PARTICLES RANGING IN SIZE FROM MICRONS TO MILLIMETERS. NO SINGLE DEVICE WHICH CAN BE ROUTINELY OPERATED ALOFT AND CAN HANDLE THIS BROAD SIZE RANGE IS PRESENTLY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE. MONITORING THE VAST RANGE OF PARTICLE SIZES WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE USE OF MULTIPLE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH THAT THE MERGING OF DATA FROM THE INSTRUMENTS IS STATISTICALLY TRACTIBLE. THIS RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE AN OPTICAL SIZING TECHNIQUE, FIBER OPTICS DATA TRANSFER TECHNOLOGY AND DATA REDUCTION ALGORITHMS WHICH CAN BE COMBINED INTO A HIGHLY PORTABLE INSTRUMENT FOR MEASURING A BROAD PARTICLE SIZE SPECTRUM AND RAINFALL RATES WHILE CARRIED ALOFT BY A REMOTE TETHERED VEHICLE, RTV.",

IN THE CASE OF GRADIENT-INDEX SYSTEMS, IT IS KNOWN THAT CERTAIN ADDITIONAL DEGREES OF FREEDOM EXIST WHICH MAKE RADIAL GRADIENTS MORE USEFUL THAN AXIAL GRADIENTS AND THAT AXIAL GRADIENTS HAVE THE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY TO CORRECT ABERRATIONS WITH RESPECT TO ASPHERIC SURFACES. HOWEVER, IT HAS NEVER BEEN SHOWN, IN REAL OPTICAL SYSTEMS, WHERE THESE ADVANTAGES LEAD. FOR EXAMPLE, DOES THIS MEAN THE DIFFERENCE OF FEWER NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN AN AXIAL GRADIENT-INDEX SYSTEM VERSUS ITS ASPHERIC COUNTERPART? IS THE ASPHERIC SYSTEM EASIER OR MORE DIFFICULT TO MAKE THAN AN AXIAL GRADIENT AND, FINALLY, WHAT IS THE EXPECTED COST ADVANTAGE IN LOW VOLUME PRODUCTION (LESS THAN 1,000 PARTS/MONTH) IN THE SHORT TERM (0-3 YEARS) AND THE LONG TERM (4-10 YEARS).",

THESE TECHNIQUES ARE VERY COMPLEX, AND INVOLVE REDUCING THE TEMPERATURE OF AIR LOW ENOUGH TO LIQUIFY THE OXYGEN AND NITROGEN AND FACILITATE THEIR SEPARATION IN A DISTILLATION COLUMN. THE PRODUCT OXYGEN IS SUPPLIED AS LIQUID IN BULK QUANTITIES OR AS A BOTTLED GAS. CHEMICAL PRODUCTION PLANTS, HOSPITALS AND MILITARY BASES WHICH RELY ON HIGH-PURITY OXYGEN MUST ALL HAVE EXTENSIVE ANDCOSTLY FACILITIES FOR STORING AND HANDLING TANKED LIQUID OXYGEN OR BOTTLED GASEOUS OXYGEN.

HOWEVER MOST OF THE X-RAY LASER CONCEPTS REQUIRE LARGE AND EXPENSIVE POWER SOURCES TO CREATE THE SOFT X-RAY LASER. RECENTLY, A NEW SOFT X-RAY LASER CONCEPT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT REQUIRES SIGNIFICANTLY LESS POWER AND, THEREFORE, WOULDBE CONSIDERABLY LESS EXPENSIVE TO CREATE. THE ND-LIKE ISOELECTRONIC SEQUENCE (60 ELECTRONS) OF HIGH Z ELEMENTS COULD PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR A SOFT X-RAY LASER. THE ND-LIKEISOELECTRONIC SEQUENCE IS A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THE SUCCESSFUL NEON- AND NICKEL-LIKE SEQUENCE LASERS THAT WERE DEVELOPED AT THE LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY. GAIN MAY BE POSSIBLE AT APPROXIMATELY 70<143> FOR THE 5F-5D TRANSITION IN ND-LIKE URANIUM. THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGE IS THAT A MEDIUM POWER ND:GLASS LASER IS SUFFICIENT TO CREATE ASOFT X-RAY LASER UNDER 100<143>. THIS WOULD MEAN THAT SOFT X-RAY LASER RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTS USING A SOFT X-RAY LASER AS A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL WOULD NO LONGER BE CONFINED TO THE LARGE NATIONAL LABORATORIES OR LARGE UNIVERSITY RESEARCHLABORATORIES.

THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS FUTURE SYSTEM WILL FOCUS ON THE NEED FOR INTEROPERABILITY OF THE INTERSERVICE AND INTERNATIONAL COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM. THESE REQUIREMENTS IMPLY AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF AUTOMATED FUNCTIONS, AND THAT MORE COMPUTER ASSISTANCE WILL BE SUPPLIED TO BOTH THE CONTROLLER AND THE PILOT. A PRIMARY GOAL OF THE SYSTEM DESIGN WILL BE THE OPTIMAL ALLOCATION OF FUNCTIONS TO THE SYSTEM, THE CONTROLLER, AND THE PILOT. THE ROLES OF EACH OF THESE CRITICAL SYSTEM ELEMENTS MUST EVOLVE IN WAYS THAT EMPHASIZE THEIR STRENGTHS, AND MINIMIZE THEIR WEAKNESSES. THE PRESENT WORK WILL DEFINE THE HUMAN FACTORS ISSUES THAT ARE OF CRITICAL IMPACT TO THE SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT OF ATALARS.

THE FEASIBILITY OF THE SLASS, TOGETHER WITH COMPLEMENTARY SENSORS, TO PERFORM AIRCRAFT SURVEILLANCE, AIRCRAFT TRACKING, AIRCRAFT CONFIGURATION, AND AUTOMATIC AIRCRAFT TYPE IDENTIFICATION WILL BE EVALUATED WITH A SYSTEMS APPROACH.

FUTURE ACCELERATOR MAGNET APPLICATIONS REQUIRE EVEN FINER DIAMETER FILAMENTS (LESS THAN 3 MICRONS) WHILE RETAINING ELECTRICAL AND MECHANICAL CHARACTERISTICS SIMILAR TO THOSE DEMONSTRATED IN TODAY'S STATE-OF-THE-ART CONDUCTORS. THIS STUDY WILL FOCUS ON TWO DIFFERENT CONDUCTOR DESIGNS AND MANUFACTURING METHODS NECESSARY TO PRODUCE HIGH CURRENT DENSITY, LOW MAGNETIZATION, DUCTILE NBTI SUPERCONDUCTORS WITH FILAMENT DIAMETERS LESS THAN 3 MICRONS. MODEL COMPOSITES WILL BE DESIGNED AND PROCESSED TO FINAL SIZE.

WITH UNALLOYED NB3SN, CRITICAL CURRENT DENSITY (JC) OF OVER 1,400 A/MM(2) AT 10 T AND LONG WIRE LENGTHS HAVE BEEN REPRODUCIBLY DEMONSTRATED. WITH 1.2 WT% TI ADDED TO NB, THE HIGH FIELD JC HAS INCREASED TO AS HIGH AS 1,000 A/MM(2) AT 12 T. HOWEVER, THE INCREASED WORK-HARDENING OF THE ALLOYED NB HAS UPSET THE PROCESS TOLERANCE SUCH THAT LONG PIECE LENGTHS ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. IN ADDITION, THE INTERNAL TIN METHOD (AS CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED)STILL INVOLVES LONG PRODUCTION TIME AND HIGH COSTS. THE LACK OF LONG LENGTHS OF ADVANCED CONDUCTORS WITH THE DESIRED TERNARY ADDITIONS HAS SERIOUSLY HAMPERED MANY OF THE RECENT MAGNET APPLICATIONS. THIS PROJECT INVOLVES A NOVEL VARIATION TO THE BASIC INTERNAL TIN APPROACH TO CIRCUMVENT SEVERAL OF THESE SHORTCOMINGS. THE MODIFIED TECHNIQUE HAS MANY POTENTIAL BENEFITS OVER THE CONVENTIONAL PROCESS: (1) GREATLY INCREASED DRAWABILITY AND LONGER PIECE LENGTHS DUE TO GEOMETRIC CHANGES IN THE NB-CU-SN COMPOSITE DESIGN PAVING THE WAY FOR HARDER TERNARY OR QUATERNARY COMPOUNDS THAT ARE SUITABLE FOR VERY HIGH FIELD APPLICATIONSAND INCREASED JC AS A RESULT OF BETTER UTILIZATION OF CONDUCTOR CORE AREA AND HIGHER NB CONTENT; (2) LOWER OVERALLCONDUCTOR COST BECAUSE OF FEWER AND SHORTER PROCESSING STEPS; AND (3) REDUCED AC LOSSES OWING TO NO FILAMENT DISTORTION AND LESS BRIDGING. A DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WILL BE CONDUCTED TO FABRICATE NB3SN CONDUCTOR BY THIS NEW DESIGN AND TO INVESTIGATE KEY PROCESS VARIABLES.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL ELECTRONIC SCREEN/FILM CASSETTE FOR USE IN MEDICAL X-RAY IMAGING (RADIOGRAPHY) IS PROPOSED. DURING PHASE I, A STANDARD CASSETTE WILL BE MODIFIED BY ADDING A TWO DIMENSIONAL ARRAY OF PHOTODETECTORS INTERDIGITATED WITH A SECOND ARRAY OF LIGHT EMITTING DIODES (LED'S), PLACED BEHIND THE BACK INTENSIFYING SCREEN. THE PHOTODETECTORS, ACTIVATED DURING A RADIOGRAPHIC EXPOSURE, WILL BE USED TO ESTIMATE THE REGIONAL X-RAY EXPOSURE RECEIVED OVER CONTIGUOUS 2-10 CM(2) REGIONS OF THE FILM. FOLLOWING THE TERMINATION OF THE X-RAY EXPOSURE, THE INTERDIGITATED ARRAY OF LEDS WOULD BE ACTIVATED MOMENTARILY,EACH DIODE DELIVERING AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF LIGHT EXPOSURE, DETERMINED BY THE SIGNAL RECORDED BY NEARBY PHOTODETECTORS, SUCH THAT THE RESULTANT OPTICAL DENSITIES RECORDED ON A RADIOGRAPH, ONCE DEVELOPED, WOULD LIE ABOVE SOME PREDETERMINED THRESHOLD VALUE. USE OF THE PROPOSED CASSETTE WILL IMPROVE UPON CURRENT RADIOGRAPHIC FILM QUALITY IN THREE WAYS: 1. BY INCREASING IMAGE CONTRAST IN ORDINARILY UNDEREXPOSED REGIONS (\"TOE\") OF A NORMAL RADIOGRAPHIC FILM; 2. BY COMPRESSING THE RANGE OF OPTICAL DENSITIES RECORDED ON A NORMAL RADIOGRAPHIC FILM, AND; 3. BY REDUCING THE \"RETAKE\" RATE FOR SEVERELY UNDEREXPOSED RADIOGRAPHS. DURING PHASE II, SEVERAL PREPRODUCTION PROTOTYPE CASSETTES WILL BE CONSTRUCTED USING SEVERAL COMMONSCREEN/FILM TYPES AND EVALUATED IN A SERIES OF CLINICAL TESTS IN A VARIETY OF RADIOGRAPHIC PROCEDURES - CHEST, MAMMOGRAPHIC AND BONE RADIOGRAPHY.",

MANY OF THE ENVISIONED FUTURE SPACE MISSIONS WILL IMPOSE STRINGENT PERFORMANCE DEMANDS ON TRACKING ACCURACY, RESPONSE TIME, ANDACTIVE SUPRESSION OF STRUCTURAL VIBRATIONS OF SUCH STRUCTURES. THESE GOALS CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE USE OF A ROBUST CONTROL DESIGN BASED UPON ON-BOARD SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION, HENCE, AN ADAPTIVE CONTROL STRATEGY. THE PROPOSED ADAPTIVE SCHEME IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE CONVENTIONAL ADAPTIVE SCHEMES, IN THAT THE IDENTIFICATION PROCESS PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT MODELING UNCERTAINTY IN THE FORMAT THAT IS ANTICIPATED BY THE ROBUST CONTROL DESIGN RULE. WITH SUCH AN ESTIMATE IN HAND, THE CONTROLLER CAN BE REDESIGNED TO PROVIDE ROBUSTNESS WITH RESPECT TO MODEL UNCERTAINTY. IN THIS PROPOSED STUDY WE WILL ADDRESS THE FEASIBILITY OF PERFORMING ON-BOARD PLANT UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION AND ROBUST CONTROL DESIGN BY USING ON-LINE INPUT-OUTPUT DATA. ON-BOARDUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY AND UNMODELED DYNAMICS. ON-BOARD ROBUST CONTROLDESIGN METHODS, CAPABLE OF HANDLING PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY AND UNMODELED DYNAMICS, WILL ALSO BE STUDIED. THE PROPOSED ADAPTIVE SCHEME WILL BE TESTED ON A SIMULATION MODEL OF A REPRESENTATIVE LSS SYSTEM.",

BY ACCOMPLISHING THESE TWO AIMS, THE PHASE I STUDY WILL INCORPORATE THE ADVANTAGES OF MICROCOMPUTER LEARNING SYSTEMS INTO AIDS PREVENTIVE INTERVENTION FOR AN UNDERRESEARCHED AND AT RISK GROUP OF AMERICAN YOUTH. FORMATIVE EVALUATION OF INTERVENTION COMPONENTS WILL GENERATE ORIGINAL DATA ON THE APPLICABILITY, EFFICIENCY, AND ACCEPTANCE OF COMPUTER-BASED TECHNOLOGIES WITH HISPANIC ADOLESCENTS. IN SO DOING, THE STUDY WILL USE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENTS TO IDENTIFY ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF COMPUTER-BASED INTERVENTIONS. STUDY FINDINGS WILL THEREBY GUIDE IMPROVEMENTS IN COMPUTER-BASED INTERVENTION METHODS FOR PREVENTING AIDS WITH HISPANIC ADOLESCENTS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THESE IMPROVED METHODS CAN THEN BE SUBJECTED TO CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH IN A PHASE II SBIR PROJECT. COMPUTER-BASED INTERVENTION FOR HIV INFECTION RISKREDUCTION AMONG HISPANIC ADOLESCENTS CAN THEN BE DISSEMINATED IN A PHASE III SBIR.

THE ABILITY OF STM TO FUNC-TION OUTSIDE ULATRA-HIGH VACUUM CONDITIONS RAISES THE POSSIBILITY OF BROADENING THE RANGE OF APPLICATION TO AREAS OTHER THEN IMAGING.

THIS WORK SHOULD PROVIDE A MEANS, OR AT LEAST, SET GUIDELINES, FOR FILTER DESIGN. ONCE THIS IS ACHIEVED, THE STAGE WOULD BE SET FOR PHASE II RESEARCH.

IN ADDITION, EACH SYSTEM HAS BEEN TAILORED FOR ONLY ONE TYPE OF COMMUNICATION SERVICE AND IN THE CASE OF ADDS ONLY HANDLE ONE SERVICE (E.G., DATA). WITH THE ADVENT OF DIGITAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO COMBINE SERVICES (E.G., VOICE, DATA, GRAPHICS, FACSIMILE AND VIDEO) INTO A SINGLE INTEGRATED DIGITAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM.

THE CONCEPT, CALLED A CORE SEPARATOR, IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF INERTIAL SEPARATION, TRADITIONALLY A LOW COST, RELIABLE METHOD OF DUST SEPARATION. HOWEVER, THE RANGE OF PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES IN INERTIAL DEVICES HAS BEEN A MAJOR LIMITATION GIVEN THEIR LOW COLLECTION EFFICIENCIES FOR PARTICLES SMALLER THAN ABOUT 10 MICRONS. THE CORE SEPARATOR HAS MANY OF THE ADVANTAGES OF OTHER INERTIAL DEVICES, BUT ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO COLLECT MORE THAN 99.9 PERCENT OF PARTICLES SMALLER THAN 10 MICRONS. THE ABILITY OF THIS SEPARATOR TO REMOVE FINE PARTICLES AT HIGH EFFICIENCY IS DUE IN PART TO A UNIQUE GAS SCRUBBER. THE SEPARATOR ALSO IS ABLE TO OVERCOME A COMMON PERFORMANCE LIMITATION CHARACTERISTIC OF OTHER MECHANICAL COLLECTORS, I.E., TURBULENCE ALONG WALL SURFACES AND RE-ENTRAINMENT OF COLLECTED PARTICLES. PROOF OF PRINCIPLE FOR THE CORE SEPARATOR WAS SHOWN IN A SMALL SCALE TEST APPARATUS. HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE DATA ARE REQUIRED TO VERIFY THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS. THUS, A BROAD PHASE I FEASIBILITY STUDY WILL BE CONDUCTED.

THE INNOVATIVE IDEA IS TO SELECTIVELY IRRADIATE REACTANTS, INTERMEDIATES, INHIBITORS OR SENSITIZERS IN THE COMBUSTION ZONE. THE ENSUING PHOTODISSOCIATION REACTIONS GENERATE HIGHLY REACTIVE RADICALS WHICH MODIFY THE GAS PHASE KINETICS AND LEAD TO IGNITION AND ENHANCEMENT VIA CHAIN-BRANCHING PATHS. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING PHOTOCHEMICAL MEANS TO IMPROVE COMBUSTION PERFORMANCE UNDER SUPERSONIC FLOW CONDITIONS. SPECIFIC TASKS FOR PHASE I EFFORT ARE LIMITED TO IGNITION AND WILL INCLUDE: SUPERSONIC PURE PHOTOCHEMICAL IGNITION TESTS (IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH NASA LANGLEY HYPERSONIC FACILITY); LITERATURE SEARCH TO IDENTIFY MOST SUITABLE PHOTO-SENSITIZERS; LABORATORY SCREENING TO QUANTIFYTHEIR EFFECTIVENESS; AND SUPERSONIC TESTS TO PROVE FEASIBILITY OF THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATES FOR PHOTOCHEMICAL IGNITION. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS FOR RAMJET/SCRAMJET COMBUSTION ARE: 1) NON-INTRUSIVE AND RELIABLE IGNITION AND FLAMEHOLDING, WHICH WILL CIRCUMVENT ENGINE-DEGRADING SHOCK WAVES PRODUCED BY CONVENTIONAL DEVICES, AND 2) IMPROVEMENT IN OVERALL COMBUSTION EFFICIENCY WHICH WILL RESULT IN MAJOR SAVINGS IN WEIGHT, BULK AND COST.",

THE SHAPING OF THE RADIATION FIELD IS ACHIEVED THROUGH AN ARRAY OF MOVABLE BUT PERMANENTLY MOUNTED TUNGSTEN RODS, THE POSITION OF THE RODS BEING SET AUTOMATICALLY BY EASY-TO-FABRICATE STYROFOAM PATTERNS. MEDICAL TECHNICIANS ARE RELIEVED OF THE BURDEN (AND OF THE FREQUENT MINOR INJURIES) ASSOCIATED WITH THE HANDLING OF HEAVY CAST-METAL COLLIMATORS, WHICH ARE AT PRESENT IN FREQUENT USE FOR THE SHAPING OF IRREGULAR FIELDS.

HOWEVER BECAUSE CAPILLARY BLOOD CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE PULSE SIGNAL, THE RELIABILITY OF THE MEASUREMENT AS A REFLECTION OF ARTERIAL OXYGEN SATURATION STILL DEPENDS ON THE ADEQUACY OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD FLOW, A CONDITION WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS PRESENT IN MANY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CLINICAL APPLICATIONS. A KEY TO ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM IS FOUND IN THE OSCILLOMETRIC PRINCIPLE FOR NONINVASIVE ARTERIAL PRESSURE MONITORING, WHICH UTILIZES ENHANCEMENT OF THE PULSESIGNAL (AS A FUNCTION OF EXTERNALLY APPLIED CUFF PRESSURE) TO MEASURE MEAN ARTERIAL BLOOD PRESSURE. SINCE THE PULSE SIGNAL ENHANCEMENT IS ASSUMED TO RESULT FROM THE INCREASED ARTERIAL COMPLIANCE RESULTING FROM THE DECREASED TRANSLUMINAL PRESSURE DIFFERENCE, IT FOLLOWS THAT THE ARTERIAL VS CAPILLARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PULSE SIGNAL SHOULD INCREASE NO LESS THAN PROPORTIONALLY TO THE MAGNITUDE OF SIGNAL ENHANCEMENT. SINCE THE FINGER HAS BECOME A POPULAR SITE FOR NONINVASIVE AND CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF BLOOD PRESSURE AS WELL AS OXYGEN SATURATION (BOTH METHODOLOGIES USING THE SAME LED TECHNOLOGIES FOR MEASURING THE PULSE SIGNAL), IT WOULD BE LOGICAL TO COMBINE TWO INSTRUMENTS INTO ONE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS BENEFIT TO OXIMETRY WHILE REDUCING THE COMBINED COST AND INCREASING THE CONVENIENCE TO THAT OF A SINGLE INSTRUMENT WITH A SINGLE SENSOR AND PLACEMENT SITE. HOWEVER, THE PRINCIPLE PRESENTLY APPLIED TO CONTINUOUS PRESSURE MONITORING IS TOO INTERFERING WITH CIRCULATION FOR COMBING WITH OXIMETRY. WE THEREFORE PROPOSE TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF USING A NONCONTACTIVE PRINCIPLE FOR CONTINUOUS PRESSURE MONITORING, DEVELOPED RECENTLY IN SHANGHAI, WHICH WOULD UTILIZE THE OSCILLOMETRIC PRINCIPLE FOR PERIODIC CALIBRATIONS OF BOTH PRESSURE AND OXIMETRY.",

MULTILAYER COMPOSITEMEMBRANES WILL BE PREPARED USING RUBBERY POLYMERS AS THE PERMSELECTIVE MATERIAL. TWO MATERIALS WITH VERY HIGH SELECTIVITIES FOR THE HIGHER HYDROCARBONS OVER METHANE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. THE MEMBRANE PREPARATION METHOD INVOLVES THE USE OF A NOVEL COATING TECHNIQUE. THE MEMBRANES WILL BE TESTED WITH METHANE AND THE HIGHER HYDROCARBONS.

THE OUTPUT FROM THIS SYSTEM WILL BE AN ESTIMATE OF THE PROBABILITY OF THUNDERSTORM OCCURRENCE DURING A SPECIFIED TWO-HOUR TIME PERIOD WITHIN A 10 KM SQUARE AREA CENTERED ON KSC. THE SYSTEM WILL BE DESIGNED TO PERMIT UPDATED FORECASTS TO BE PREPARED FROM 24 HOURS TO 1/2 HOUR PRIOR TO THE VERIFICATION PERIOD. THE THUNDERSTORMPROBABILITY WILL BE DETERMINED THROUGH THE USE OF A MULTIVARIATE DISCRIMINANT FUNCTION WITH THE PREDICTORS BEINGSELECTED ACCORDING TO THEIR RELATIVE PREDICTIVE POWER. SEPARATE DISCRIMINANT FUNCTIONS WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR EACH FORECAST PREPARATION TIME SO THAT A GRADUAL SHIFT BETWEEN THE MODEL AND OBSERVATIONAL PREDICTORS CAN BE ACHIEVED AS ONE APPROACHES THE FORECAST VERIFICATION TIME. THE DYNAMICAL MODEL SELECTED FOR THIS PROJECT IS THE MESOSCALE ATMOSPHERIC SIMULATION SYSTEM (MASS) MODEL. IT WILL BE INITIALIZED WITH A MESOSCALE 3-DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS AND RUN FOR A 24 HOUR PERIOD TO PRODUCE MODEL PREDICTORS. THE OBSERVATIONAL PREDICTORS WILL INCLUDE TRADITIONAL DATA SUCH AS STANDARD SURFACE WEATHER REPORTS AND CONVENTIONAL RADAR ECHOES AS WELL AS DATA FROM EMERGING HIGH TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMSSUCH AS VHF DOPPLER WIND PROFILERS, THE NEXRAD DOPPLER RADARNETWORK, AUTOMATED SURFACE MESONET OBSERVATIONS, SATELLITE IMAGERY AND SATELLITE-DERIVED SOUNDINGS.",

COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS, THE PIEZOELECTRIC PUMP COULD PROVIDE VASTLY SMALLER PUMPING VOLUMES, GREATER RELIABILITY AND ACCURACY, SIMULTANEOUS \"PUSH-PULL\" PUMPING MODES, AND CONVENIENT (SOLID-STATE) AUTOMATION AND CONTROL OF FLUID DELIVERY/REMOVAL PROGRAMS. THE RESEARCHERS WANT TO BUILD AND TEST PIEZOELECTRIC PUMPS FOR INJECTING DRUGS INTO TISSUES OR CELLS. THEY HAVE DEVELOPED PIEZOPUMPS FOR MANY APPLICATIONS, BUT BIOMEDICAL USES WILL REQUIRE PUMPING THROUGH CONSIDERABLY SMALLER ORIFICES AND AGAINST HIGHER FLUID RESISTANCE. THUS THEY WILL TEST PIEZOPUMP PERFORMANCE UNDER SIMULATED INTRAVITAL PUMPING CONDITIONS AND DETERMINE SUCH MATTERS AS MINIMUM ORIFICE FOR RELIABLE PUMPING, MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM RELIABLE FLOW RATS, AND PUMPING ACCURACY. THE PIEZOELECTRIC PUMPING SYSTEM COULD SUBSTANTIALLY EXPAND THE RESEARCH CAPABILITES OF MOST BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH LABORATORIES; PROCEDURES NOW DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE COULD BE ROUTINE WITH THE SOLID-STATE PUMP.",

MRA HAS SPONSORED 4 YEARS OF RESEARCH AT M.I.T. DEVELOPING THE GROWTH OF VERY HIGH QUALITY CRYSTALS USING LIQUID PHASE ELECTROEPITAXY (LPEE). MRA HAS GROWN BULK GAAS CRYSTALS WHICH APPROACH 25MM IN DIAMETER, 5MM IN THICKNESS AND DEMONSTRATE A PURITY, STRUCTURAL PERFECTION, HOMOGENEITY, AND LUMINESCENCE EFFICIENCY FAR SUPERIOR TO MELT GROWN MATERIAL. MRA PROPOSES AN ATTEMPT TO GROW HIGHLY EFFICIENT (IN TERMS OF LUMINESCENCE INTENSITY) AND COMPOSITIONALLY UNIFORM, EPITAXIAL QUALITY III-V TERNARY BULK CRYSTALS BY LPEE. THESE CRYSTALS, ANTICIPATED TO REACH 25MM IN DIAMETER, 5MM IN THICKNESS, ARE NOT ACHIEVABLE BY ANY OTHER GROWTH TECHNIQUE. IF SUCCESSFUL, A NEW CLASS OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY SUBSTRATE MATERIALS WILL BECOME AVAILABLE. THESE MATERIALS WILL BE MOST PROMISING FOR OPTOELECTRONIC AND MICROWAVE DEVICES. PHASE I WILL STUDY WHICH TERNARYS AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS ARE IN GREATEST DEMAND BY DEVICE RESEARCHERS AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED FIRST. IT WILL ALSO PINPOINT THE NECESSARY RESOURCES.

THESE SOURCES OF NATURAL GAS TYPICALLY ARE EITHER TOO DILUTE OR TOO FAR FROM EXISTING GAS PIPELINES TO BE OF COMMERCIAL VALUE. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO DEVELOP A SYSTEMS APPROACH TO USING THESE WASTE GAS STREAMS TO FUEL ONSITE POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. THE RESEARCH FOCUSES ON DEFINING THEQUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE AVAILABLE GAS STREAMS AND CONSIDERING INNOVATIVE WAYS OF COMBINING THE INDIVIDUAL STREAMS TO PROVIDE AN OPTIMAL FUEL SUPPLY FOR POWER GENERATION. SINCE THE ERRATIC NATURE OF GOB GAS PRODUCTION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE CRITICAL OBSTACLE TO COMMERCIALIZING POWER GENERATION, THIS PROJECT WILL SUPPLEMENT GOB GAS WITH OTHER GAS SOURCES FROM THE COAL MINE. CONSEQUENTLY, COALBED METHANE (CBM), GOG GAS, ABANDONED MINE EMISSIONS, AND MINE VENTILATION AIR WILL BE STUDIED. NO PUBLISHED REFERENCES HAVE BEEN MADE TO AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM TO UTILIZE SEVERAL OF THESE STREAMS IN A COMPLEMENTARY FASHION. PROJECT FIELD WORK WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED AT THE CAMBRIA NO. 33 MINE IN CAMBRIA COUNTY, PA. THIS LOCATION IS WELL SUITED FOR THE RESEARCH, SINCE IT IS ALREADY PRODUCING THREE TYPES OF GAS. (THE FOURTH TYPE, CBM, CAN CERTAINLY BE ADDED, SINCE THE COAL GAS CONTENT IS SIGNIFICANT IN THIS AREA). THE LOCATION HAS COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE APPALACHIAN BASIN.",

IN ADDITION TO ITS PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLE IN MEDIATING STRESS, RECENT CLINICAL STUDIES HAVE PROVIDED EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT HYPERACTIVITYOF CRF-CONTAINING PATHWAYS WITHIN THE BRAIN MAY BE A CONTRIBUTING PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC FACTOR IN DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS.

THE CURRENT PROPOSAL PROVIDES A PLAN FOR IDENTIFICATION AND EVALUATION OF CENTRALLY-ACTIVE NONPEPTIDE ANTAGONISTS OF CRF TO BE DEVELOPED AS NOVEL THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES FOR TREATING ANY OF THE DISORDERS MENTIONED ABOVE. STARTING WITH AN INVENTORY OF APPROXIMATELY 20,000 COMPOUNDS, IN VITRO RADIOLIGAND BINDING AND ADENYLATE CYCLASE ASSAYS WILL SERVE AS INITIAL SCREENING PROCEDURES FOR IDENTIFYING SELECTIVE CRF ANTAGONISTS.

NARCOTICS IS CONSIDERED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AS ONE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY PROBLEMS FACING THIS NATION AND THE WORLD ON THE WHOLE. THESE DRUGS ARE MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND BROUGHT IN FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. MARINE VESSELS ARE ONE OF THE MAJOR DRUG TRAFFICROUTES. IF THE DRUG TRAFFIC IS STOPPED OR REDUCED SUBSTANTIALLY IT WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT. THE EASY AND NON DESTRUCTIVE DETECTION OF THE NARCOTIC DRUGS CANPLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THIS TASK. IT HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO DETECT COCAINE, HEROIN OR OTHER SIMILAR DRUGS RELIABLY ON MARINE VESSELS USING CONVENTIONAL METHODS. ESPECIALLY, COCAINE AND HEROIN HAVE HIGH VALUE ON THE BLACK MARKET. THEREFORE, THESE DRUGS CAN BE SHIPPED IN QUANTITIES EASILY CONCEALED ON CARGO TANK VESSELS, PLEASURE CRAFT OR IN CONTAINERS ONBOARD CONTAINER SHIPS. SUFFICIENTLY STRONG JUSTIFICATION IS NEEDED FOR THE COAST GUARD TO OPEN A SUSPECTED COMPARTMENT, BECAUSE SUCH ANOPENING USUALLY RESULTS IN THE DESTRUCTION OF AN AREA OF THEVESSEL. THEREFORE, JUSTIFICATION WITHOUT PHYSICAL EVIDENCE MAY CAUSE LOSS OF VALUABLE TIME AND EFFORT. A DETECTOR WHICH GIVES STRONG PHYSICAL EVIDENCE FOR CONCEALED COCAINE AND HEROIN IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL NARCOTIC DRUGS SEARCHES. WE PROPOSE HERE A FEASIBILITY STUDY OF AN INNOVATIVE DETECTOR FOR REMOTE INSPECTION OF CONCEALED COMPARTMENTS FORCOCAINE AND HEROIN OR SIMILAR NARCOTIC DRUGS ON MARINE VESSELS OR OTHER SIMILAR VEHICLES OF TRANSPORTATION SUCH AS AIRPLANES, HELICOPTERS, TRUCKS, CARS, ETC. PRELIMINARY TESTS CARRIED OUT ON THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE HAVE BEEN VERY ENCOURAGING. IT IS A NON-DESTRUCTIVE TECHNIQUE AND IS EXPECTED TO WORK THROUGH ALL KINDS OF COMPARTMENT BARRIERS, SUCH AS WOOD, FIBERGLASS, PLASTICS, ALUMINUM AND STEEL. IT WILL BE PORTABLE SO THAT IT CAN BE HAND CARRIED AND POINTED AT SUSPECTED CONCEALMENT AREAS. IT WILL BE DESIGNEDTO HAVE COMPACT DIMENSIONS SO THAT IT WILL FIT INTO TIGHT ENVIRONMENTS.",

EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT PLATELET-DERIVED GROWHT FACTOR (PDGF) STIMULATES THE GROWTH OF THE SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS, WHICH ARE THE PREDOMINANT CELL TYPE OF THESE LESIONS.PDGF EXPRESSION HAS BEEN MEASURED DIRECTLY IN CELLS OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUES, AND PDGF BETA-RECEPTOR LEVELS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE HIGHER IN THE SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS OF PLAGUES RELATIVE TO NORMAL ARTERIAL TISSUE. LOCALIZED HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF PDGF ARE ALSO THOUGHT TO BE PRODUCED BY ADHERING PLATELETS AT THE LESION SITE. PDGF EXERTS ITS MITOGENIC EFFECT ON CELLS THROUGH TWO SPECIFIC RECEPTOR PROTEIN-TYROSINE KINASES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO FIND SPECIFIC INHIBITORSOF THESE PDGF-RECEPTOR KINASE ACTIVITIES FOR EVALUATION AS THERAPEUTIC DRUGS IN THE TREATMENT OF ATHEROCSLEROSIS.

OPTICAL FIBER SYSTEMS CAN INTEGRATE THESE DEVICES IN A FLEXIBLE, DYNAMIC NETWORK WHICH CAN OPERATE IN A VACUUM, HIGH-RADIATION ENVIRONMENT WITH SIGNAL BANDWIDTH EXCEEDING 1 GHZ. THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBES SEVERAL OPTICAL FIBER NETWORK CONCEPTS, RANGING FROM FIBER POINT-TO-POINT SIGNAL DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS AND PROCESSOR BUS EXTENDERS TO A FIBER BUS NETWORK USING AN ALL-OPTICAL CROSSBAR SWITCH AS THE CENTER HUB INTERCONNECTING MANY PROCESSORS AND DEVICES. THE CROSSBAR SWITCH IS CAPABLE OF 5 MICROSECOND RECONFIGURATION TIME, WIDE BANDWIDTH (> 1 GHZ) USING A SINGLE WAVELENGTH OR WAVELENGTH DIVISION MULTIPLEXING (WDM) AND THE TRANSMISSION OF EITHER ANALOG OR DIGITAL DATA. THE FEASIBILITY STUDY PROPOSED WILL CONSIDER NETWORK ARCHITECTURES, MULTIPLEXING HARDWARE AND FORMATS, PROTOCOLS, SWITCHING AND RECONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS, AND INTERFACING TO SENSORS ANDSIGNAL PROCESSING DEVICES IN PRESENT AND FUTURE SPACECRAFT AND SPACE PLATFORMS.",

SEVERAL LABORATORIES HAVE PROPOSED IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF EXPERIMENTATION BY CHANNELING NEUTRONS TO REMOTE EXPERIMENTAL STATIONS VIA GUIDETUBES. THE ADVANTAGES OF THESE GUIDETUBE FACILITIES HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN EUROPE AND JAPAN. A MULTI-LAYERED THIN FILMCOATING, KNOWN AS A \"SUPERMIRROR\", CAN REPLACE NI COATINGS FOR SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED GUIDETUBE EFFICIENCY. FOR THE PAST DECADE, THERE HAS BEEN A GLOBAL RESEARCH EFFORT TO PRODUCE USEFUL GUIDETUBE SUPERMIRRORS. USE OF STANDARD VACUUM DEPOSITION TECHNIQUES HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL, APPARENTLY BECAUSE OF LAYER INSTABILITIES THAT ARE MATERIAL,SYSTEM, AND PROCESS RELATED. TO PRODUCE RELIABLE SUPERMIRROR PRODUCTS ON A LARGE SCALE, PROBLEMS OF CONTROLLING LAYER GROWTH MUST BE ADDRESSED. PROBLEMS THAT AFFECT LAYER UNIFORMITY INCLUDE CRYSTAL GROWTH, STRESS/STRAIN EFFECTS, AND FILM/SUBSTRATE ADHESION. PHASE IWILL USE STATE-OF-THE-ART DEPOSITION PROCESS TECHNIQUES TO INVESTIGATE METHODS FOR CONTROLLING THE LAYER DISTURBANCES ON SUBSTRATES OF A LIMITED SIZE. EACH METHOD WILL BE EVALUATED FOR ITS SUCCESS IN IMPROVING LAYERING QUALITY AND NEUTRON REFLECTIVITY. IN PHASE II, THE PREFERRED PROCESS WILL BE INVESTIGATED FOR OPTIMIZATION OF LARGE SCALE LAYER UNIFORMITY, YIELDS, AND DIFFERENT METHODS OF BATCH PROCESSING. THIS WILL BE THE BASIS FOR A PROPOSED BUSINESS PLAN IN PHASE III.",

THEREFORE, THEY REQUIRE SKILLED LABOR, INSTRUMENTATION AND OFTEN MULTI-STEP SAMPLE PREPARATION WORKOUT. IN PRELIMINARY STUDIES, WHICH STEMMED FROM OUR WORK ON GAS ANALYSIS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, WE ESTABLISHED THAT AN ACCURATE ANALYSIS OF WATER CAN BE DONE USING A VERY SIMPLE DEVICE THAT CONTAINS A TITRANT AND A CHROMOPHORE. THE PROTOTYPES THAT WE HAVE BUILT (PHOTOS ARE INCLUDED) ARE 3\" X 1\" X 1/16\" PLASTIC CARDS AND WEIGH APPROXIMATELY 1 GM EACH. TO MEASURE AN ANALYTE, THE USER HAS ONLY TO DIP THE CARD IN THE WATER FOR 10-60 SECONDS AND READ THE CONCENTRATION FROM THE LOCATION OF THE COLOR FRONT THAT DEVELOPS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO CONDUCT A SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF DIFFERENT PHYSICAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT CAN BE USED TO CARRY ON THE TESTS, AND TO EVALUATE ALTERNATIVE CHROMOPHORIC MIXTURES THAT CAN BE USED FOR THE ANALYSIS. IN THE PRELIMINARY WORK, DEVICES WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR THE ANALYSIS OF FIVE KEY WATER COMPONENTS: ACIDITY, ALKALINITY, CHLORIDES, SULFATES AND AMMONIA CONCENTRATIONS. DEVICES FOR THE ANALYSIS OF ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS WILL BE DEVELOPED IN SUBSEQUENT STUDIES. FOR EACH DEVICE, WE WILL EVALUATE THE SENSITIVITY,SELECTIVITY, AND THE RATE OF RESPONSE TO THE DESIGN ANALYTE. IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONDUCT PRELIMINARY STUDIES RELATIVE TO THE SHELF LIFE OF THE DEVICE AND THE REPRODUCIBILITY OF THE RESULTS. WE ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT 11,000,000 TESTS ARE CONDUCTED ANNUALLY BY GOVERNMENT LABORATORIES AND ABOUT 17,000,000 ADDITIONAL TESTS ARE CONDUCTED BY PRIVATE LABORATORIES TO DETERMINE THE CONCENTRATION OF DIFFERENT ANALYTES FOR WATER QUALITY ASSESSMENT FOR AGRICULTURAL USE, BOILERS, POLLUTION CONTROL,ETC. THE COST OF CONDUCTING EACH SUCH TEST IS $10-40 AND IT TAKES 20 MINUTES TO 2 HOURS TO COMPLETE EACH TEST. THE COST OF MANUFACTURING ONE TITRASTRIP(TM) TESTING DEVICE USING OUR METHOD IS ABOUT $0.5-1.25 EACH AND WILL TAKE THE USER LESS THAN TWO MINUTES TO OBTAIN THE RESULTS. MOREOVER,BECAUSE OF THEIR SMALL SIZE AND WEIGHT, THEY LEND THEMSELVES TO FIELD USE SINCE THE USER CAN PUT MANY OF THEM IN HIS WALLET. THE USE OF THESE CARDS WILL NOT ONLY REDUCE THE COST OF CONDUCTING WATER ANALYSIS BUT IT WILL ALSO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE RESULTS SINCE IT WILL ELIMINATE THE OPERATOR AS A VARIABLE AND BECAUSE IT WILL ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR SAMPLE HANDLING. THE USERS WILL BE ABLE TO CONDUCT MORE TESTS BECAUSE OF THE LOWER COSTS AND THEREFORE AN OVERALL BETTER WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT WILL BE ACHIEVABLE.",

FURTHERMORE, THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THESE COATINGS CAN BE APPLIED TO A VARIETY OF SUBSTRATES UNDER APPROPRIATE PLASMA CONDITIONS. THE PHASE I RESEARCH EFFORT DESCRIBED CENTERS ON A MORE QUANTITATIVE CHARACTERIZATION OF THESE FILMS ALONG WITH A DETERMINATION OF THEIR CORROSION RESISTIVITY. THE CHARACTERIZATION WORK WILL INCLUDE VARIOUSSPECTROSCOPIC AND MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS, PARTICULARLY FR-IR, ESCA AND SEM. THE CORROSION RESISTIVITY WILL INCLUDE MONITORING THE MORPHOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL CHANGES OF THESE FILMS ON EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS CHEMICALS BUT, PARTICULARLY, ONEXPOSURE TO KNOWN CONCENTRATIONS OF O((3)P) ATOMS.",

IMAGE PROCESSING HAS BEEN LIMITED TO BLACK-AND-WHITE IMAGES. RECENT PROGRESS IN MICROCOMPUTERIMAGE-PROCESSING HARDWARE WILL NOW ALLOW THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE TRUE-COLOR IMAGE PROCESSING AND SOPHISTICATED IMAGE STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. THE AIM OF PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DESIGN A TRUE-COLORIMAGE-PROCESSING WORKSTATION FOR PATHOLOGY RESEARCH. THE WORKSTATION WILL BE BASED ON A POWERFUL MICROCOMPUTER, SPECIALIZED OFF-THE-SHELF HARDWARE TO OBTAIN TRUE-COLOR MICROSCOPIC IMAGES, AND A REMOVABLE WRITE-ONCE LASER DISK DRIVE TO PROVIDE HIGH-CAPACITY STORAGE FOR IMAGES. IMAGE-PROCESSING SOFTWARE WILL BE DESIGNED TO ALLOW ROUTINE IMAGE MEASUREMENT, MANIPULATION, IDENTIFICATION, AND ANALYSIS. RESEARCH WILL BE DONE ON ALGORITHMS FOR TRUE-COLOR IMAGE PROCESSING, AND A STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR IMAGES WILL BE PLANNED.

THE OBJECTIVE OF PHASE I IS TO DEMONSTRATE A CRITICAL PHASE (THERMAL ENVIRONMENT) OF THE WEAPONIZATIONABILITY OF THE BASS AND TO PROVIDE A PROGRAM FRAMEWORK FOR EXTENDING THIS DEVELOPMENT TO A WEAPONS QUALIFIABLE SWITCH.

BOTH OF THESE PRODUCTS HAVE DIRECT APPLICATION IN REDUCING THE INCIDENCE OF READING FAILURE IN THE ELEMENTARY GRADES. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF PHASE I ARE TO: (1) DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL STRUCTURE FOR A QUICK, SIMPLE-TO-ADMINISTER, GROUP-SCREENING TEST FOR PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS; (2) VALIDATE THE GROUP-SCREENING INSTRUMENT AGAINST STANDARD, INDIVIDUALLY ADMINISTERED PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS TESTS; AND (3) PREPARE PROTOTYPIC TRAINING MATERIALS FOR SMALL-GROUP INSTRUCTION IN PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS AND PROVIDE EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. THIS PROJECT IS BASED ON A SOLID RESEARCH CONSENSUS CONCERNING THE IMPORTANCE OF PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS IN THE ATTAINMENT OF EARLY READING SKILLS. THERE ARE PRESENTLY NO GROUP MEASURES OF PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS AVAILABLE, NOR ARE THERE ANY FORMAL TRAINING MATERIALS WIDELY AVAILABLE.",

IN ADDITION, SENSITIVE DETECTORS ARE SUBJECT TO VERY HIGH BACKGROUND COUNTING RATES. CONSEQUENTLY, THESE INSTRUMENTS NEED TO BE PROTECTED FROM THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE PLASMA UNDER STUDY. EXISTING X-RAY IMAGING SYSTEMS ARE ILL SUITED TO THE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT OF DT OPERATIONS AT THE TOKAMAK FUSION TEST REACTOR (TFTR), THE COMPACT IGNITION TOKAMAK (CIT), OR FUTURE FUSION REACTORS BECAUSE THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE WAY TO PREVENT UNWANTED RADIATION FROM ENTERING THROUGH THE INSTRUMENT'S APERTURE.

TEST RESULTS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE DESIGN OF A COMMERCIAL IFR FUEL CYCLE FACILITY. THIS PROJECT CONTRIBUTES TO DEVELOPMENT OF A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN FOR AN ADVANCED ROBOTIC MANIPULATOR SYSTEM THAT CAN BE RETROFITTED INTO THE HFEF-S. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE DEMONSTRATION TESTS TO CONFIRM THAT ADVANCED ROBOTICS CAN IMPROVE THE FACILITY'S ON-LINE AVAILABILITY BY PERFORMING PROGRAMMED OPERATIONAL SUPPORT TASKS AND REMOTE MAINTENANCE OF THE PROCESS EQUIPMENT. INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEM IS A TWO- ARMED ROBOTIC MANIPULATOR MOUNTED TO A PROGRAMMABLE TELESCOPING-TUBE TROLLEY. AN EXISTING BRIDGE IN THE HFEF-S WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH POSITIONFEEDBACK FOR PROGRAMMABLE OPERATION AND USED TO TRANSPORT THE TROLLEY. THE EQUIPMENT WILL BE MODULARIZED FOR REMOTE REPAIR AND HARDENED TO 10(8) RAD. IT ALSO WILL BE CAPABLE OF WET DECONTAMINATION. THE ADVANCED ROBOTIC MANIPULATOR SYSTEM CAN BE OPERATED VIA BOTH PROGRAMMED AND MAN-IN-THE-LOOP (TELEOPERATION) MODES.

THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE RELATIVE POTENCIES OF VARIOUS COCAINE ANALOGS IN VIVO AND THEIR BINDING AFFINITY FOR THE COCAINE SITE IN VITRO. INFORMATION ON THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF COCAINE MAY BE GAINED BY CHARACTERIZATION OF THIS RECEPTOR. STUDIES OF THIS NATURE ARE DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF A RADIOLABELED LIGAND WITH HIGHER AFFINITY AND/OR SPECIFIC ACTIVITY THAN TRITIATED COCAINE. IN PHASE I, THREE NOVEL COCAINE ANALOGS WILL BE PREPARED IN WHICH THE C-3 BENZOYL GROUP OF COCAINE IS REPLACED BY A P-FLUOROPHENYL GROUP, A MODIFICATION WHICH HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO INCREASE THE POTENCY OF COCAINE DERIVATIVES IN BEHAVIORAL STUDIES ABOVE THAT OF COCAINE ITSELF. THE BINDING PARAMETERS OF THE ANALOGS AT THE COCAINE RECEPTOR IN MONKEY BRAIN WILL BE MEASURED. THE MOST PROMISING COMPOUND WILL BE EVALUATED FORCOCAINE-LIKE ACTIVITY IN VIVO BY CONDUCTING BEHAVIORAL STUDIES IN SQUIRREL MONKEYS. THIS ANALOG WILL BE TRITIATED AND ITS BINDING PROPERTIES COMPARED WITH THOSE OF TRITIATED COCAINE. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT A HIGH AFFINITY RADIOLIGAND ARISING FROM THIS RESEARCH WILL BE A COMMERCIALLY VALUABLE PRODUCT FOR PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND DRUG SCREENING APPLICATIONS.

THE THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF A CO2 LASER RADAR ARE THE LASER HEAD AND FLOW LOOP, THE PULSED POWER SYSTEM AND THE OPTICS AND BEAMS CONTROL SYSTEM. A SELF SUSTAINED DISCHARGE CONCEPT IS BEING DEVELOPED THAT ISEXPECTED TO RESULT IN THE STABLE AND EFFICIENT EXTRACTION OF LARGE SPECIFIC ENERGIES (50 J/LITER) FOR PULSE LENGTHS AS LONG AS 100 MICRO-SEC. THIS FACTOR OF TEN INCREASE IN THE ENERGY PER UNIT VOLUME, IF ACHIEVED, WOULD ENABLE LASER HEADS TO BE FABRICATED WITH FACTORS OF FOUR TO FIVE TIMES SMALLER IN VOLUME AND WEIGHT THAN WITH CONVENTIONALDISCHARGE APPROACHES. FURTHERMORE, THE REDUCED CROSS SECTION OF THE OPTICAL BEAM WOULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE SIZE AND WEIGHT OF THE OPTICS AND BEAM CONTROL SYSTEM. THIS CONCEPT WOULD RESULT, WHEN SUCCESSFUL, IN COMPACT, ELECTRTICALLY PULSED CO2 LASERS. THESE LASERS WOULD BE USEFUL IN COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS RANGING FROM LASER WELDING AND METAL WORKING TO LASER SURGERY.",

SUCH UV SENSORS MAY PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN TARGET IDENTIFICATION, TRACKING, SEEKING AND DISCRIMINATION AND MAY PROVE INSTRUMENTAL FOR EARLY WARNING OF ATTACK AND KILL DETERMINATION. SPACE-BASED APPLICATIONS, IN PARTICULAR, HAVE CREATED AN URGENT NEED FOR MINIATURE TUNABLE IMAGING UV SENSORS. IN THIS INVESTIGATION, ACOUSTO-OPTIC TECHNIQUES ARE BEING USED TO DEVELOP A SMALL SIZE, LOW MASS ACOUSTO-OPTIC TUNABLE UV FILTER (AOTF) WITH HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLUTION, RAPID WAVELENGTH SCANNING CAPABILITY ASWELL AS RANDOM ACCESS WAVELENGTH SELECTION, AND TWO-DIMENSIONAL SPECTRALLY-RESOLVED IMAGING CAPABILITY. THE AOTF ESSENTIALLY CONSISTS OF A PIEZOELECTRIC TRANSDUCER BONDED TO A BIREFRINGENT CRYSTAL. EXCITATION OF THE TRANSDUCER BY AN APPLIED RF MODULATES THE INDEX OF REFRATIONVIA THE ELASTO-OPTIC EFFECT. THIS GENERATES A MOVING PHASE GRADIENT WHICH UNDER PROPER CONDITIONS WOULD DIFFRACT PORTIONS OF AN INCIDENT LIGHT BEAM. BOTH COLLINEAR AND NON-COLLINEAR CONFIGURATIONS ARE BEING INVESTIGATED TO ACHIEVE NON-CRITICAL PHASE MATCHING. DESIGN PARAMETER TRADE-OFFS ARE BEING AIMED AT MINIMIZING THE SIZE OF THE DEVICE. CHARGE-COUPLED DEVICE (CCD) ARRAYS AND MICROCHANNEL ARRAY-MULTIANODE DETECTORS ARE BEING EVALUATED. FLAST GATE CCD ARRAYS WITH POTENTIAL FOR 100% QUANTUM EFFICIENCY IN THE UV ARE RECEIVING SPECIAL ATTENTION. SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF THE AOTF UV SENSOR WOULD COMBINE THE SPATIAL IMAGING CAPABILITY OF AN INTERFERENCE FILTER AND THE TUNABILITY OF A GRATING SPECTROMETER WITH A SIZE/MASS REDUCTION OF AT LEAST TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE OVER CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SYSTEMS. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS EXIST IN SPACE-BASED INTERCEPTORS, WHERE SMALL SIZE AND MASS ARE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE.

THE SM POWER AMPLIFIER OPERATES BY COMBINING THE OUTPUTS OF DISCRETE SETS OF SWITCHING TRANSISTORS, WITH EACH SET OF TRANSISTORS OPERATING IN SATURATION AS THE INPUT SIGNAL MOVES THROUGH ITS THRESHOLD RANGE. AS EACH TRANSISTOR SET CONDUCTS, THE REMAINING SETS ARE CUTOFF. THE COMBINED OUTPUT WAVEFORM REPRESENTS AN ACCURATE, BUT AMPLIFIED, REPLICA OF THE INPUT WAVEFORM. THE BASIC SM DESIGN WAS DEVELOPED BY SCS TELECOM, INC AND INITIAL CALCULATIONS INDICATE THAT EFFICIENCIES OF UP TO 80-90% AND SPURIOUS NOISE COMPONENTS NEAR ZERO ARE ACHIEVABLE WITH THIS DESIGN. THIS WILL RESULT IN LOW WEIGHT, EXTREMELY EFFICIENT POWER AMPLIFIERS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONIC WARFARE SYSTEMS. COMMERCIAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS WILL ALSO BENEFIT FROM THIS DESIGN AS COSTS DROP WITH THE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF HIGH POWER IC'S.",

THE DETECTOR WILL BE WELL COLLIMATED, AND A XENON PULSED LIGHT SOURCE WITH VARIABLE COLLIMATION ANGLE WILL BE LOCATED IN FRONT OF THE TELESCOPE LENS. BY SUCCESSIVELY INCREASING THE COLLIMATION ANGLE OF THE LIGHT SOURCE, SCATTERING CAN BEMEASURED AT SUCCESSIVE ANGLES BY SUBTRACTION. THE ANGULAR RANGE OF THE DEVICE WILL BE FROM APPROXIMATELY 165 DEGREES TO 178 DEGREES SCATTERING.

THE PROPOSED SYSTEM, CALLED VSAR (FOR VELOCITY SAR), MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THE FIRST TIME TO OBTAIN AN UNDISTORTED HIGH-RESOLUTION VIEW OF THE OCEAN SURFACE. MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT PROVIDES DIRECT OBSERVATION OF OCEAN SURFACE CURRENTS MOVING AT DIFFERENT VELOCITIES, MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO \"FILTER OUT\" INTERNAL WAVES AND OTHER SURFACE FEATURES INDUCED BY VESSEL MOTION, FROM THE BACKGROUND \"CLUTTER\" CAUSED BY AMBIENT OCEAN WAVES. A REMARKABLE FEATURE OF THE VSAR IS THAT IT USES THE SAME RADAR HARDWARE AS A CONVENTIONAL SAR, DIFFERING ONLY IN THE SUBSEQUENT PROCESSING. THANKS TO THIS FACT THE TEST AND VALIDATION OF THIS CONCEPT CAN BE PERFORMED USING AVAILABLE RADA HARDWARE, OR EVEN EXISTING SAR DATA. THUS, WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE VSAR CONCEPT ON REAL DATA DURING THE PHASE II PROJECT.",

THE DESIGN IS BASED ON A VARIABLE RESIDENCE TIME (VRT) CONCEPT WHICH ALLOWS LARGE FUEL PARTICLES ADEQUATE TIME TO COMPLETELY BURN IN THE CIRCUMFERENTIALLY MIXED PRIMARY ZONE. HIGH DURABILITY OF THE COMBUSTOR IS ACHIEVED BY DUAL FUNCTION USE OF THE INCOMING AIR. THE PRESENT PROPOSAL IS FOR AN EXPERIMENTAL AND ANALYTICAL PROGRAM TO PREDICT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED COMBUSTOR AND COMPARE IT WITH THAT OF A STATE OF THE ART COMBUSTOR CURRENTLY BEING DESIGNED FOR A 10 LB/SEC AIR FLOW CLASS ENGINE. THE SUPPORTS OF A MAJOR GAS TURBINE ENGINE MANUFACTURER AND A WORLD RENOWNED AUTHORITY ON COMBUSTION HAVE ALREADY BEEN OBTAINED FOR THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS REQUIRED FOR THIS PROGRAM.",

A UNIQUE APPROACH USING ONLY DIFFUSELY REFLECTED LASER LIGHT FROM THE AREA OF INTEREST IS PROPOSED. IN THIS APPROACH, STANDOFF DISTANCES OF UP TO EIGHT INCHES ARE POSSIBLE, AND REPOSITIONING OF THE SENSOR IS A SIMPLE AND RAPID PROCEDURES REQUIRING NO SPECIAL SURFACE PREPARATION OR ATTACHMENT OF RETRO-REFLECTORS. BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE DESIGN OF THE SENSOR, NO COMPLICATED VIBRATION ISOLATION TECHNIQUES ARE REQUIRED. THE SENSOR HEAD MAY BE MOUNTED IN ANY ARBITRARY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO SENSOR HEAD VIBRATION AS LONG AS THE AREA OF INTEREST REMAINS WITHIN THE VIEW OF THE SENSOR HEAD. MECHANICAL SHOCK ISOLATION MAY BE APPLIED TO THE SENSOR HEAD TO ALLOW SURVIVAL WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH THE MEASUREMENT. A COMPLETELY OPTICAL APPROACH TO THE SENSOR HEAD AND DATA CABLE DESIGN ELIMINATES ALL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATIONS IN OR GENERATION OF AN ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE ENVIRONMENT.",

THE METHOD USES ONLY MEASURED SHIP MOTIONS AND PROVIDES A RATIONAL BASIS IN TIME-OPTIMAL CONTROL THEORY FOR ESTABLISHING REQUISITE FORECASTING INTERVALS. THE FORECASTING TECHNIQUE IS BASED ON CONTINUOUS REAL-TIMEIDENTIFICATION OF THE SINUSOIDAL AMPLITUDES AND PHASE ANGLES IN THE RANGE OF FREQUENCIES THAT CHARACTERIZE THE ENCOUNTERED MODAL PERIOD OF MOTIONS, REPEATED SAMPLING OF SHIP MOTIONS, AND FAST-TIME INTEGRATION OF SEVERAL HIGHER DERIVATIVES OF MOTION COUPLED WITH MEASURED INITIAL CONDITIONS. THE MOTION FORECAST METHOD HAS BEEN VALIDATED IN THE LABORATORY IN REAL TIME WITH RECORDED TIME HISTORIES OF ACTUAL SHIP MOTIONS. THE NECESSARY SHIP MOTION MEASURING TECHNIQUES, SENSORS, AND COMPUTER PROGRAMS FOR OPERATIONAL REAL-TIME SHIP MOTION FORECASTING ARE DESCRIBED. A PROGRAM IS PROPOSED FOR ASSESSING THE ACCURACY OF THE FORECASTING AS A FUNCTION OF THE PREDICTION INTERVAL, THE ACCURAY OF THE ESTIMATED SINUSOIDAL AMPLITUDES AND PHASE ANGLES IN THE RANGE OF FREQUENCIES THAT CHARACTERIZE THE ENCOUNTERED MODAL PERIOD, AND THE ACCURACY OF THE SENSED AND SAMPLED SHIP MOTIONS.",

THIS MATERIAL IS POTENTIALLY DIFFICULT TO FABRICATE IN A THIN-WALLED VACUUM-TIGHT VESSEL.

THIS MATERIALS SHOWS PROMISE FOR SURVIVABILITY, WELDABILITY, NEUTRON ABSORBTIVITY, DEBRIS AND MICROMETEOROID RESISTANCE, AND 3 TO 5 KG/M2 RADIATOR MASS WHILE SERVING AS A WALL MATERIAL FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE RADIATOR COMPONENTS. IN THIS PROGRAM, THE FEASIBILITY OF ADVANCED REFRACTORY COMPOSITES AS A HARDENED RADIATOR WALL MATERIAL IS BEING INVESTIGATED.

HEAT PIPES REDUCE THE REQUIRED COOLANT FLOW VIA INCREASED SURFACE AREA AND PERMIT THE ACTIVE COOLING SYSTEM TO BE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE TOKAMAK CHAMBER.

ADULT STANDARDS ARE DEFINED BY PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED ADULT CORPORA. IN PHASE I, WORD FREQUENCIES WILL BE CALCULATED AND CHECKED AGAINST PUBLISHEDCOUNTS FOR THESE CORPORA. OTHER CORPORA, DEFINED BY MATERIALS WRITTEN FOR STUDENTS FROM EARLY GRADES ON, WILL BEANALYZED. COUNTS WILL BE CONDITIONED ON PROSE DIFFICULTY, BECAUSE VARIABILITY IN BOOK DIFFICULTY DEFINED BY PUBLISHERS' GRADE LEVEL DESIGNATIONS IS EXCEEDINGLY LARGE. PHASE I WORD FREQUENCY COUNTS WILL BE TWICE THE SIZE OF THE LARGEST PUBLISHED SCHOOL CORPORA. VOCABULARY MEASURES ARE DEVELOPED IN PHASE II. STRATIFIED SAMPLES FROM THE FREQUENCY BANDS OF THE ADULT CORPUS WILL BE DRAWN TO TEST FOR LEXICAL MEANINGS. LATENT TRAIT MODELS AND TASA'S CALIBRATION DESIGNS WILL BE USED TO OBTAIN SAMPLE-FREE ESTIMATES OF VOCABULARY ITEM DIFFICULTY. PHASE II RESEARCH SHOULD SHOW THAT SEVERAL FACTORS ACCOUNT FOR DIFFICULTY OF VOCABULARY TEST ITEMS, INCLUDING THE FREQUENCY OF THE WORD IN THE ADULT CORPUS, THE RELATIVE FREQUENCY OF THE WORD IN CORPORA THAT FORM THE DEVELOPMENTAL SCALE, AND THE RELATIVE FREQUENCY OF THE WORD'S LEXICAL MEANING.",

VIDEO DATA RATES IMPLY VERY HIGH CARRIER FREQUENCIES (GIGAHERZ) WHICH IN TURN REQUIRE LINE OF SIGHT TRANSMISSION. MANEUVERING OPTIONS ARE SERIOUSLY HAMPERED. A THREE-FOLD APPROACH IS PROPOSED TO REDUCE VIDEO DATA RATES, AND HENCE TRANSMISSION FREQUENCIES, BY MORE THAN TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. THE FIRST STEP IS TO RESAMPLE IMAGE DATA USING LOG-POLAR COORDINATES. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT THIS YIELDS BETTER THAN AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE REDUCTION IN PIXEL COUNT, FOR A GIVEN RESOLUTION IN THE CENTER OF THE FIELD OF VIEW. THE SECOND STEP IS TO EXTRACT ONLY SALIENT IMAGE FEATURES FOR TRANSMISSION. THE THIRD IS SIGNAL COMPRESSION BY PROVEN TECHNIQUES SUCH AS BLOCK TRUNCATION CODING. THIS STUDY WILL IMPLEMENT SOFTWARE ALGORITHMS FOR IMAGE REMAPPING, FEATURE EXTRACTION AND SIGNAL COMPRESSION. THESE WILL BE TESTED ON REAL IMAGERY IN NON-REAL TIME.

THE INSTRUMENT MEASURES VIBRATIONS FROM 1 HZ TO 100,000 HZ AND OUTPUTS ANALOG SIGNALS PROPORTIONAL TO THE VIBRATION VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION. THE WIDE FREQUENCY RANGE IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN IDENTIFYING BEARING FAULTS, WHICH SOMETIMES PRODUCE VIBRATION SPECTRA IN THE 50 KHZ TO 100 KHZ RANGE.

A TWO-DIMENSIONAL FLOW FACILITY, WITH A STREAMLINED OBSTACLE TO SIMULATE THE FLOW PAST AN UNDERWATER VEHICLES, WILL BE ASSEMBLED FOR THE PHASE I DEMONSTRATION. NEARLY NEUTRALLY BUOYANT MICROCAPSULES FILLED WITH A FLUORESCENT DYE SOLUTION WILL BE USED AS THE PARTICLES. A SHEET OF LASER LIGHT WILL ILLUMINATE THE FLOW FIELD. THE POSITIONS AND THUS THE TRAJECTORIES OF THE PARTICLES WILL BE RECORDED WITH A TWO-DIMENSIONAL PHOTODIODE ARRAY CAMERA CONSISTING OF 128 X 128 PIXELS. TO MAXIMIZE THE FIELD OF VIEW WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE RESOLUTION, WE WILL INTENTIONALLY BLURR THE IMAGES OF THE PARTICLES TO COVER 10 TO 20 PIXELS, WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE SIGNFICANTLY THE RESOLUTION OF THE ARRAY CAMERA. UP TO 10 FRAMES OF CAMERA OUTPUT WILL BE STORED ON FAST STATIC RAM CHIPS VIA A FLASH ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL INTERFACE. THE DATA WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO A HARD DISK OF A MICROCOMPUTER. SOFTWARE WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR DATA ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE PARTICLE TRAJECTORIES, VELOCITIES AND ACCELERATIONS. EXTENSION OF THE METHOD TO MEASUREMENTS IN A THREE-DIMENSIONAL FLOW FIELD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II BY USING A TWO-CAMERA STEREOSCOPIC SYSTEM.",

THE IDEA IS TO COMBINESEVERAL OF THESE TECHNIQUES TO APPLY THEM CONCURRENTLY TO THE SAME EARTH VOLUME, IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR INDIVIDUALPOWERS OF RESOLUTION. OF COURSE, THIS CAN BE DONE PROFITABLY EVEN WITH SEISMIC TECHNIQUES ALONE, BY COMBINING THE RESULTS OF REFLECTION AND REFRACTION SURVEYS WITH VARIOUS KINDS OF VERTICAL SEISMIC PROFILING AND WELL-LOG DATA, AND THEY WILL BE PURSUING THOSE ASPECTS AS WELL, IN THIS AND IN THEIR CURRENT INVERSION PROJECT. THE MAIN INGREDIENT THAT THEY WILL LOOK FOR IN THE DIFFERENT MODELING TECHNIQUES IS THAT THEY SHARE SOME COMMON PARAMETERS, I.E., THAT THEY ARE COUPLED IN PARAMETER SPACE, IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY INFLUENCE EACH OTHER. THE FACT THATOPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES WILL BE USED TO FIT THE DIFFERENT DATA SETS WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE MATHEMATICAL MODELS, NATURALLY BRINGS OUT THE ISSUE OF MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; ANOTHER OF THEIR PROPOSED TASKS WILL BE TO LOOK INTO CURRENT THEORY AND PRACTICE IN THAT FIELD IN ORDERTO IDENTIFY USEFUL TECHNIQUES THAT APPLY TO THIS PROBLEM.",

THE TOTAL EXCURSION AND RATE OF MOVEMENT OF THE BELLOWS ARE ELECTRONICALLY CONTROLLED USING A CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK WHICH MONITORS BELLOWS POSITION AND INTERNAL PRESSURE. THIS MICROPROCESSOR-BASED CONTROL SYSTEM PERMITS FLEXIBLE OPERATING MODES, INCLUDING FIXED RATE, AUTONOMOUS VARIABLE RATE, AND PASSIVE SYNCHRONOUS AND EKG-TRIGGERED SYNCHRONOUS COUNTERPULSATION AT ANY DESIRED STROKE VOLUME. IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR DIRECT SPECIFICATION OF THE PRESSURIZATION ENVELOPE TO THE BLOOD PUMP, ELIMINATING EXCESSIVE SYSTOLIC RATES OF PRESSURIZATION OR HIGH DIASTOLIC NEGATIVE PRESSURES, EITHER OF WHICH CAN PRODUCE HEMOLYSIS. BY VIRTUE OF ITS EXTREME MECHANICAL SIMPLICITY, THE DRIVER IS INHERENTLY RELIABLE. ITS TARGET ELECTROMECHANICAL EFFICIENCY OF 20 PERCENT WILL ALSO RESULT IN A COMPACT AND PORTABLE PUMP DRIVER THAT IS LOW IN COST COMPARED TO THE BULKY AND MECHANICALLY COMPLEX SYSTEMS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.",

THE PROSTHESES EMPLOY AN INTEGRALLY TEXTURED SILICONE RUBBER SURFACE AT THE TISSUE INTERFACE THAT PROMOTES TISSUE ATTACHMENT TO THE PROSTHESIS AND MINIMIZES TISSUE CAPSULE FORMATION AROUND THE IMPLANT. THE PROSTHESES ARE FILLED WITH A READILY METABOLIZED, NONTOXIC LIQUID TO DIMINISH ANY COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO LEAKAGE. THEY ARE ALSO PERCUTANEOUSLY ADJUSTABLE IN VOLUME IN ORDER THAT AN OPTIMALCOSMETIC RESULT CAN BE ACHIEVED AFTER HEALING OF THE PERI- IMPLANT TISSUES. THE FIRST TASK IS THE MANUFACTURE OF HARDWARE TO FABRICATE THE DEVICES USING VACUUM MOLDING METHODS. A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS USING ADULT RABBITS WILL THEN BE EMPLOYED TO (1) EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY OF THE PERCUTANEOUS FILLING PORT USED TO ADJUST THE VOLUME OF THE IMPLANTED DEVICES, AND (2) CHARACTERIZE THE EFFECTS OF VOLUME ADJUSTMENTS ON TISSUE CAPSULE STRUCTURE. SUSCEPTIBILITY OF THE IMPLANT SITES TO INFECTION WILL BE INVESTIGATED, AS IT IS LIKELY THAT HEALED TEXTURED SURFACE IMPLANTS ARE MORE RESISTANT TO BACTERIAL COLONIZATION THAN IDENTICAL SMOOTH SURFACE DEVICES, POSSIBLY MAKING THEM LESS SUBJECT TO CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. FINALLY, A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY ONTISSUE CAPSULE MORPHOLOGY WILL BE CONDUCTED USING A REGIMEN TYPICALLY FOLLOWED FOR LUMPECTOMY PLUS RADIATION. THESE STUDIES ARE DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE PROSTHESES FOR SUBSEQUENT CLINICAL TRIALS. AWARDEE'S STATEMENT OF THE POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONSOF THE RESEARCH: SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY (LUMPECTOMY) PLUS RADIATION IS BEING UTILIZED WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY IN PREFERENCE TO RADICAL MASTECTOMY.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE ANTICIPATED RESULT OF THE PROPOSED PHASE I WORK IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ELECTROLYTE FOR THE LITHIUM (LI)/SILVER VANADIUM OXIDE (SVO) SYSTEM THAT WOULD PROVIDE CELL PERFORMANCE AT -40 DEGREES CENTIGRADE AS DEMANDED BY EMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTERS (ELTS) AND EMERGENCY POSITIONINDICATING RADIO BEACONS (EPIRBS). THE LI/SVO CHEMISTRY WASCHOSEN DUE TO ITS HIGH VOLUMETRIC ENERGY DENSITY, GOOD HIGH RATE PERFORMANCE, LOW SELF-DISCHARGE, STATE OF CHARGE INDICATION, EXCELLENT SAFETY CHARACTERISTICS, AND ABUSE RESISTANCE. IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS CHEMISTRY WOULD PROVIDE CELLS CONTAINING NON-NOXIOUS ELECTROLYTES WITH THE PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY CHARACTERISTICS DESIRED FOR THE APPLICATION. PHASE II WOULD INVOLVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERATELY PRICED SPIRALLY WOUND CELLS SUITABLE FOR ASSEMBLYINTO BATTERY PACKS FOR ELT AND EPIRB USE. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS INCLUDE MILITARY AND SPACE APPLICATIONS, BUOYS, WEAPONS SYSTEMS, AND OTHER APPLICATIONSREQUIRING HIGH RATES AT WIDE TEMPERATURE RANGES. CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART PRIMARY BATTERY TECHNOLOGY HAS ACHIEVED ENERGY DENSITIES AS HIGH AS 1 WH/CC, OR 500 WH/KG. APPLICATIONS IN SPACE WILL REQUIRE EVEN HIGHER ENERGY DENSITIES, AND NOVEL BATTERY CONCEPTS ARE ONE APPROACH TO IMPROVING THE VOLUMETRIC AND GRAVIMETRIC ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF SPACE POWER. THE LITHIUM BROMINE FLUORINE (LI/BRF3) COUPLE IS BEING INVESTIGATED AS A POSSIBLE NEW HIGH ENERGY DENSITY SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM HAS PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED AS (EMF) OF 5.12 V. IN ADDITION, BRF3 HAS SEVERAL DESIRABLE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. IF FEASIBILITY IS PROVED OF PACKAGING THIS SYSTEM IN CONFIGURATIONS SIMILAR TO CURRENT LITHIUM/OXYHALIDE CELLS, ENERGY DENSITIES AS HIGH AS 2.8 WH/CC, OR 1500 WH/KG COULD BE CONCEIVABLE ACHIEVED. IN DETERMINING THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A LI/BRF3 PRODUCT, THE EXPERIMENTATION IS FOCUSSING ON MATERIALS COMPATABILITY AND GATHERING INFORMATION AS TO THE REALISTIC ENERGY DENSITIES IN PRACTICAL PRIMARY CELL PROTOTYPE CONFIGURATIONS. DRASTIC IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY DENSITY ARE DEEMED NECESSARY IN MILITARY SPACE APPLICATIONS. SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRF3 THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO PREPARE USEFUL LENGTHS OF A HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTING WIRE AND TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE WIRE IS A PHYSICALLY STABLE SUPERCONDUCTOR WITH HIGH CURRENT CARRYING CAPABILITY, SUITABLE FOR POWER TRANSMISSION, CONDITIONING, AND STORAGE SYSTEMS. THE WIRE IS BEING CHARACTERIZED FOR: RESISTIVITY, AS A FUNCTION OF TEMPERATURE AND CURRENT DENSITY; PHYSICAL STABILITY; RESPONSE IN AN RLC RESONANT CIRCUIT; MEISSNER EFFECT; AND THE EFFECT AN APPLIED MAGNETIC FIELD HAS ON CRITICAL CURRENT DENSITY. THE GROSS PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE WIRE ARE BEING DETERMINED BY A SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE. AUGER PROFILE ANALYSIS IS USED TO DETERMINE THE WIRE CHEMISTRY. THE EFFECTS OF MOISTURE, REPEATED TEMPERATURE CYCLES, AND REOXIDATION ARE ALSO BEING EVALUATED. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, IF SUCCESSFUL, WILL HAVE IMMEDIATE APPLICATION IN PROVIDING COMMERCIAL SUPERCONDUCTING WIRE FOR THE FABRICATION OF ADVANCED HIGH-FIELD MAGNETS AND SOLENOIDS, ELECTRIC MOTOR WINDINGS, SUPERCONDUCTING ROTORS IN ELECTRIC POWER GENERATORS, TRANSFORMERS, INDUCTION ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS, AND SQUIDS.",

HORMONAL THERAPY, IF GIVEN, IS NEARLY ALWAYS ADMINISTERED ON AN EMPIRICAL BASIS. CONVENTIONAL BIOCHEMICAL ESTROGEN (ER) AND PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR (PGR) ASSAYS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PERFORM IN THIS MALIGNANCY SINCE SPECIMENS OFTEN CONTAIN ADMIXTURES OF BENIGN, HYPERPLASTIC AND MALIGNANT GLANDULAR ELEMENTS, STROMA AND MYOMETRIUM, ALL OF WHICH MAY CONTRIBUTE RECEPTOR TO A TUMOR CYTOSOL. THIS PROJECT PLANS TO STUDY INTACT TISSUE SECTIONS OF ENDOMETRIAL TUMOR TISSUE FOR ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE BINDING SITES USING FLUORESCEIN TAGGED STEROID CONJUGATES OFESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE (FLUORO-CEP(R)) WHICH ALLOW FOR LOCALIZATION OF STEROID BINDING SITES AT A CELLULAR AND SUBCELLULAR LEVEL. EVENTUALLY, ASSAY RESULTS WILL BE CORRELATED WITH A VARIETY OF CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL FEATURES INCLUDING AGE, MENOPAUSAL STATUS, TUMOR GRADE AND STAGE. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, RESULTS WILL ALSO BE CORRELATED WITH THOSE OF IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL ASSAYS EMPLOYINGMONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE AND, WHERE SUFFICIENT TISSUE IS AVAILABLE, WITH RESULTS OF CONVENTIONAL BIOCHEMICAL ER AND PGR ASSAYS. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THESE STUDIES IS TO DEVELOP AN INEXPENSIVE METHOD TO ACCURATELY ASSAY FOR ENDOMETRIAL TUMOR STEROID BINDING SITES WHICH WILL HELP CLINICIANS IN THE SELECTION OFA MORE RATIONAL THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED CARCINOMA. THE ASSAY SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF PERFORMANCE IN THE AVERAGE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL PATHOLOGY LABORATORY. PHASE I OF THESE STUDIES WILL CONCERN ITSELF WITH A PRELIMINARY COMPARISON OF FLUORO-CEP(R) WITH OTHER HISTOCHEMICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL PROCEDURES FOR DETECTION OF ER AND PGR.",
