THE \"HIGH-END\" INSTRUMENTS HAVE BECOME VERY COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT AN ACCURATE AND RELIABLE RESULT CAN BE REPORTED. YET, THERE IS NO TOOL AVAILABLE TO DO THESE KINDS OF MEASUREMENTS ANY DIFFERENTLY OR BETTER. THIS PROJECT IS CONCERNED WITH TWO METHODS FOR THE CLINICAL FLOW CYTOMETRY HEMATOLOGY LABORATORY THAT CAN OVERCOME THE PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH HEMOGLOBIN CONCENTRATION AND VOLUME INTERFERENCES WHEN MAKING RED BLOOD CELL MEASUREMENTS AND OVERCOME THE PROBLEM OF REFRACTIVE INDEX AND VOLUME INTERFERENCE IN THE WHITE BLOOD CELL DIFFERENTIAL MEASUREMENT. THIS IS DONE BY SIMULTANEOUSLY DETERMINING CELL DRY MASS BY MEASUREMENTS OF PHASE USING A TWO-FREQUENCYHENE LASER AND CELL VOLUME BY THE PRINCIPLE OF DYE EXCLUSION. THIS PHASE I RESEARCH WILL CHARACTERIZE BOTH TECHNIQUES USING PARTICLE AND BLOOD SAMPLES ON AN EXPERIMENTAL FLOW CYTOMETER.

A RESONANT MODE SUITABLE FOR ACCELERATING CHARGED PARTICLE BEAMS ARISES FROM THE PRESENCE OF A DEFECT IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL LATTICE OF DIELECTRIC OBSTACLES PLACED BETWEEN TWO CONDUCTING SHEETS. PBG RESONATORS HAVE TWO UNIQUE PROPERTIES THAT MAY OVERCOME MANY OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THE PRESENT STATE OF THE ART: (1) IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN A STRUCTURE WITH NO HIGHER ORDER MODES AND WITH THE SINGLE RESONANT FREQUENCY ENERGY DISTRIBUTED IN A PURE MONOPOLE MODE, THEREBY REDUCING BEAM INSTABILITIES AND ALSO REDUCING ENERGY LOSSES; AND (2) IT IS EXPECTED THAT ONE COULD ACHIEVE Q > 10(6) AT 4 K USING PRESENTLY AVAILABLE NIOBIUM MATERIAL, WITH PARTICULAR EASE, BECAUSE ONLY FLAT SHEETS OF SUPERCONDUCTOR ARE REQUIRED, WITH NO JOINTS OR BENDS. IN PHASE I, OPTIMUM CONFIGURATIONS OF PBG STRUCTURES FOR ACCELERATOR APPLICATIONS ARE BEING ESTABLISHED THROUGH NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS. SUITABLE MEANS WILL BE ESTABLISHED FOR COUPLING FIELDS BETWEEN ADJACENT RESONATORS AND FOR COUPLING RADIO FREQUENCY POWER INTO A PBG ACCELERATOR STRUCTURE.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE DISPOSAL OF 280 MILLION TIRES GENERATED EACH YEAR IN THEU.S. BY LANDFILL IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING AN UNACCEPTABLE SOLUTION. THE TIRES TAKE UP LARGE AMOUNTS OF VALUABLE LANDFILL SPACE AND ALSO REPRESENT A FIRE HAZARD. A BETTER SOLUTION FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC STANDPOINT IS TOTHERMALLY REPROCESS THE TIRES INTO VALUABLE PRODUCTS SUCH ASACTIVATED CARBON AND OTHER SOLID CARBON FORMS (CARBON BLACK,GRAPHITE, AND CARBON FIBERS). THE KEY TO PRODUCING SUCH A PRODUCT IS THE CHEMISTRY OF LOW TEMPERATURE CARBONIZATION. THE INNOVATION OFFERED IN THIS PROJECT IS TO PRECISELY CONTROL THE CARBONIZATION WITH: 1) A PREDICTIVE MODEL INCORPORATING A DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES OCCURRING DURING CARBONIZATION; 2) THE USE OF THIS MODEL TO SUGGEST MODIFICATIONS IN THE STARTING MATERIALS; 3) ON-LINE MONITORING OF THE CARBONIZATION PROCESS; AND 4) IMPROVED CONTROL OF FABRICATION PROCESSES BASED ON ITEMS 1 AND 3. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I PROGRAM IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT CARBONIZATION CAN CONVERT USED TIRES INTO ACTIVATED CARBON OR SOME OTHER MARKETABLE CARBON FORM. THERE ARE PRELIMINARYRESULTS THAT SHOW THIS IS POSSIBLE. THIS PROGRAM WILL RELY ON THE PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY OF AFR'S UNIQUE CARBONIZATION MODEL AND THE APPLICATION OF A NOVEL TG-FTIR METHOD TO PROVIDE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF TIRE CARBONIZATION. THE PHASE I PROGRAM CONSISTS OF FOUR ELEMENTS: 1) SELECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE STARTING MATERIALS; 2) MEASUREMENT AND MODELING OF THE CARBONIZATION PROCESS; 3) CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CHAR PRODUCTS AND EVALUATION OF THE ACTIVATION STRATEGIES; 4) DESIGN OF THE PHASE II PROTOTYPE. THE PHASE II PROGRAM WOULD EXTEND THE STUDIES DEVELOPED IN PHASE I TO A WIDER RANGE OF CARBONIZATION CONDITIONS USING THE SAME EXPERIMENTAL METHODS AND MODELS. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENT WASTE STREAMS WOULD BE ADDRESSED: REJECTED POLYMERPARTS, CUTTINGS FROM TRIMMING OPERATIONS, RECYCLED PLASTIC, ETC. AN INTERMEDIATE SCALE PROCESS FOR LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS WOULD BE DEVELOPED IN PHASE II. SUCH A REACTOR SYSTEM WOULD PROCESS - 1 KG/HR AND THUS SIMPLIFY THE SCALE-UP NECESSARY IN PHASE III.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         AEROSOL PROCESSING IS A POPULAR METHOD TO PRODUCE SUBMICRON PARTICLES FOR TECHNOLOGIES LIKE PIGMENTS AND SINTERABLE CERAMICS. ALTHOUGH THE PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION (PSD) OFTEN CONTROLS THE QUALITY OF THE FINAL PRODUCT, THIS PARAMETER CANNOT CURRENTLY BE MEASURED ON-LINE BECAUSE OF THE DENSE PARTICLE STREAMS. IN ADDITION, THE NUMBER DENSITYAND TEMPERATURE OF THE PARTICLES IN THE REACTOR ARE ALSO UNKNOWN. CONSEQUENTLY, EFFECTIVE PROCESS MONITORING AND CONTROL IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. ADVANCED FUEL RESEARCH, INC. (AFR) HAS DEVELOPED A NOVEL FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED (FT-IR) EMISSION/TRANSMISSION (E/T) TECHNIQUE THAT CAN OVERCOME THE ABOVE PROBLEMS. THE TECHNIQUE USES THE WAVELENGTH DEPENDENCE OF IR LIGHT SCATTERING TO SIZE PARTICLES. AS A RESULT, IT CAN OPERATE IN DENSE AEROSOL STREAMS BECAUSE PARTICLES < 10 MUM DO NOT SCATTER IR AS EFFICIENTLY AS VISIBLE LIGHT. E/T FT-IR CAN ALSO SIMULTANEOUSLY MEASURE PARTICLE NUMBER DENSITY AND PARTICLE TEMPERATURE AS WELL AS GAS CONCENTRATIONS AND TEMPERATURE. APPLYING THE ABOVE METHOD TO YIELD A PSD REQUIRES DEVELOPINGNEW WAYS TO DECONVOLUTE THE FT-IR SPECTRA, HOWEVER. FORTUNATELY, RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MAINE CAN MODIFY AN ULTRASONIC DECONVOLUTION METHODOLOGY TO FIT THE PROPOSED FT-IR APPLICATION. BY COMBINING E/T FT-IR AND A DECONVOLUTION ALGORITHM, A SINGLE FT-IR SPECTROMETER SHOULD BE ABLE TO MONITOR PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS AND TEMPERATURES IN A PROCESS STREAM AND ISSUE PROCESS CONTROL COMMANDS. THIS PROPOSAL IS A COMBINED RESEARCH EFFORT BY AFR AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MAINE TO DEVELOP A SENSOR FOR PARTICLE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE GAS REACTION MIXTURES. THE SENSOR WILL BE ON-LINE AND IN-SITU AND WILL DECONCOLUTE THE FT-IR SPECTRA TO YIELD THE PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION. THE PHASE I RESEARCH WILL DEMONSTRATE THE TECHNOLOGY BY DECONVOLUTING THE MEASURED IR SPECTRA OF KNOWN TIO2 PARTICLES TO YIELD AN ACCURATE PSD. A SIMPLE LABORATORY SCALE FLAME WILL SHOW THAT IN-SITU MEASUREMENTS ARE FEASIBLE. PHASE II RESEARCH WILL INCLUDE EXTENSIVE RESEARCHON A TIO2FLAME IN AN INDUSTRIAL LABORATORY. THE FINAL STEP OF PHASE II WILL BE A FIELD TEST ON A COMMERCIAL TIO2 REACTOR.",

Advanced Optical Systems, Inc. (AOS) has demonstrated with optical processing: aim point selection in visible imagery, in clutter; target recognition in infrared imagery; and small feature recognition internal to a target, in simulated IR imagery. We propose to combine lessons learned from each of these tasks with an innovative hybrid processing architecture, in order to provide robust aim-point selection in the infrared. The keys to successful real time aim-point selection in cluttered infrared images are: Adaptive control of image preprocessing; Proper design of filters; and Dual channel optical processing architecture. AOS proposes a correlator in which the preprocessor is controlled by the features of the Fourier transform plans and the output of the correlator. In this innovative approach a neural network will learn the relationship between preprocessor parameters and Fourier plane features, with quality aim-point correlation as the criteria. The result will be preprocessing which adapts so that the image presented to the correlator is modified to provide the best aim-point selection.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This research will substantially advance the state of the art in single-chip photodetector arrays. Advanced Photonix, Inc. manufactures unique large-area, single-element silicon avalanche photodiodes (currently 16mm active-area diameter,but potentially up to 75mm). The research will demonstrate feasibility (Phase I) and produce a prototype (Phase II) of such a photodetector subdivided into an array of individually isolated \"pixels\". Each 1x1mm(2) pixel will have a gain of 1000 and a noise equivalent power (NEP) of 2x10(-15) W/Hz(1/2) at 800nm - about a factor of twenty better than conventional (gain=1) silicon photodetectors of the same pixel area. This innovation will permit breakthroughs in strategic defense applications, including the imaging laser radars in \"brilliant\" antimissile interceptors. Breakthroughs will also be possible in civilian applications, such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning, and optical fiber readout of high energy physics detectors.",

The Super Sensitive Solid-State Detector's outstanding performance results from a unique multi-layered silicon structure.

(AST) FOR USE IN OPTICAL AND ELECTRO-OPTICAL DEVICES. PDLC MATERIALS CAN BE APPLIED AS A TUNABLE OPTICAL FILTER WHICH CAN RESPOND TO AN ELECTRIC FIELD AND CAUSE A SELECTED ATTENUATION OF OPTICAL RADIATION FROM FAR INFRARED THROUGH ULTRAVIOLET WAVELENGTHS, WHICH CAN BE USED FOR FAST ELECTRICAL CONTROL OF THE VISUAL AND INFRARED SIGNATURES OR WINDOWS OF AIRCRAFTS, SHIPS, AND LAND VEHICLES. THE ELECTRO-OPTIC PROPERTIES OF PDLC FILMS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE TYPES OF MATERIALS USED, THE DROPLET MORPHOLOGY AND THE METHOD OF FILM CONSTRUCTION. THE DESIRABLE PROPERTIES INCLUDE HIGH CLARITY AND TRANSMISSION OF THE FILM IN THE ON AND OFF STATES, LOW DRIVING VOLTAGE, LOW POWER CONSUMPTION, AND FAST SWITCHING TIMES. IN THIS PHASE I PROGRAM, WE WILL STUDY SOME OF THE POSSIBLE PDLC FABRICATION TECHNIQUES AND HOW THESE FABRICATIONS WILL AFFECT THE OPTO-ELECTRONIC PROPERTIES OF THE PDLC MATERIALS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Increasing Navy use of embedded computer systems results in stringent requirements for real-time performance, reliability, and cost. Computer systems are critical embedded components of Naval warfare systems. The demands on embedded computer systems are increasing in terms of information processing and storage/retrieval. The designer must analyze results across many dimensions to identify critical design components and initiate design changes that meet numerous requirements simultaneously. These mission critical distributed computer systems are too complex to engineer without automated support. Currently available standalone support tools provide no help for managing complex design tradeoffs between performance, reliability, and cost. Previous research results can provide a basis for developing an expert system for extensible, multi-measure design evaluation of real-time distributed systems. The Phase l effort will determine the feasibility of developing an expert system/ performance modeling tool to provide extensible support for engineering complex real-time, distributed systems. The proposed tool will be of immediate use by the Navy. It will result in lower cost, greater reliability, and higher performance while reducing developmental and operational risks. Because the expert system will be extensible, it will be applicable to a wide range of Naval systems.",

DISSIPATION OF REACTION HEAT. THE SOLID HYDRIDE REACTANT IS DISTRIBUTED FOR THIS PURPOSE IN A CARTRIDGE OF CORRUGATED AND PERFORATED SHEET METAL. STRANDS OF WICKING MATERIAL ARE PLACED IN CONTACT OF THE HYDRIDE AND WICKING PADS PLACED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ASSEMBLY. THE CARTRIDGE IS PLACED IN A PRESSURE VESSEL. WATER IS METERED TO THE VESSEL AND DISTRIBUTED RAPIDLY BY WICKING THROUGHOUT THE CARTRIDGE GENERATING HYDROGEN AS REQUIRED BY THE LOAD (LOAD RESPONSIVE). IN ADDITION, WATER IS VAPORIZED BY THE HEAT GENERATED IN THE REACTION AND CONDENSED ON THE REACTOR WALLS OR COOLING COILS BEFORE BEING RECYCLED BY WICKING. THE VOLUME EXPANSION TAKING PLACE DURING THE CONVERSION IS TAKEN UP BY THE CORRUGATED SHEET METAL STRUCTURE.

THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL FOR PASSIVE MICRO-OPTICAL COMPONENTS MANUFACTURED FORM THE GLASSY STATE IS SIGNIFICANT. GLASS CAN BE EASILY SHAPED, WORKED, READILY DRAWN INTO FIBER AND OTHER OPTICVAL WAVEGIUIDE STRUCTURES, AND VOLUME MANUFACTURED AT LOW COST. PERMANENT HOLOGRAPHIC GRATINGS INDUCED IN GLASS CAN BE OPTICALLY OR THERMALLY ERASED WITHOUT DAMAGING THE MATERIAL, SUGGESTING A POTENTIAL APPLICATION IN ALL-OPTICAL READ/WRITE ERASE THREE-DIMENSIONAL MEMORY ARCHITECTURES. IN ORDER TO TAP THE FULL POTENTIAL FOR BRAGG-FILTER DEVICES FABRICATED WITH GLASS A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES MUST BE OVERCOME. ORDER OF MAGNITUDE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GRATINGS' SCATTERING EFFICIENCIES MUST BE ACHIEVED TO PRODUCE TECHNICALLY APPEALING PASSIVE OR ACTIVE OPTICAL COMPONENTS. UNFORTUNATELY, THE PHYSICAL MECHANISM(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR GRATING FORMATION AND RELATED PHENOMENA IN GLASS AND OPTICAL FIBER CANNOT BE READILY EXPLAINED USING CONVENTIONAL SOLID STATE OPTICS THEORY APPLIED TO CRYSTALLINE MATERIALS. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THOSE CHALLENGES BY REVIEWING AND IDENTIFYING PHYSICAL MECHANISMS ALREADY KNOWN TO PARTICIPATE IN GRATING INFORMATION.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Three new techniques have been developed over the past 36 months that offer significant potential for on-board monitoring of mechanical systems to detect and classify incipient failures. The first is the wavelet transform, and its extension to wave packets, as a means for isolating changes in signal structure in terms of scale as well as time. The second is an extension of classical time-series analysis to multiresolution representations of a time signal, with algorithms to estimate characteristic functions of the spectrum of the signal at each resolution. The third is the maturation of artificial neural network technology to the point where it may be reliably considered as an element of an on-board diagnostic system. This effort combines all three into a comprehensive approach to incipient failure detection and classification. The front-end of our proposed classifier extracts novel feature sets offered by the wavelet transform and the multiresolution tLme series spectral estimators. These define a feature space on which a classical neural net classifier may be trained and evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this research is to determine the feasibility of using advanced Petri iiet technology to analyze the performance of large-scale sensor and C3 (i.e., C3I) systems. The US Navy is developing future C3I systems to support its mission and fundamental warfare tasks. The decision of which C3I systems to fund and field and how to integrate them into a given platform must be based on the contribution of the C3I system to overall system effectiveness. ALPHATECH has developed an interactive, graphical sLmulation tool called Modeler, specifically for quantitative C3I system performance evaluations. Modeler uses advanced Petri nets models of sensors, corn munications, and concepts of operation to relate low-level technical parameters to overall mission effectiveness. ALPHATECH has extended this tool to interact with external signal processing and data fusion algorithms, and used it to assess the performance of alternative designs and technologies for certain air defense systems. ALPAHTECH proposes to use Modeler to provide quantitative evaluation of a specific mobile surveillance system (MSS), Combat DP. In Phase I, we will model, sLmulate, and analyze the performance of Combat DP at a level of detail sufficient to produce output representative of Combat DP. In Phase II, we will develop a robust, full- scale model of Combat DP.",

SUCH AN ASSAY WOULD PROVIDE AN INEXPENSIVE AND WIDELY APPLICABLE METHOD FOR SCREENING FOR GENETIC DISEASES, DETECTING MUTATIONS IN ONCOGENES AND TUMOR SUPRESSOR GENES, TYPING VIRUSES AND FOR OTHER RESEARCH AND DIAGNOSTIC APPLICATIONS. CURRENT RIBONUCLEASE PROTECTION ASSAY PROCEDURES ARE ABLE TO DETECT ONLY ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF SINGLE-BASE MUTATIONS. PRELIMINARY RESULTS WITH RNASE I FROM E. COLI, WHICH HAS RECENTLY BEEN CLONED AND OVEREXPRESSED, INDICATE THAT IT IS CAPABLE OF DETECTING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SINGLE-BASE MUTATIONS THAN THE CONVENTIONALLY USED RNASES A AND T1. RNASE I IS ABLE TO CLEAVE AFTER ALL FOUR BASES, UNLIKE THE COMBINATION OF RNASE A AND T1, WHICH IS ONLY ABLE TO CLEAVE AFTER C, G AND U RESIDUES. IT WILL BE DETERMINED HOW EFFECTIVE RNASE I IS FOR DETECTING ALL OF THE 12 POSSIBLE SINGLE-BASE MISMATCHES. IN ADDITION, REACTION CONDITIONS FOR DETECTION OF SINGLE-BASE MISMATCHES WILL BE OPTIMIZED, AND, IF NECESSARY, AN ASSAY WHICH WILL RAPIDLY IDENTIFY IN CRUDE CELL HOMOGENATES NOVEL RIBONUCLEASES WITH THE ABILITY TO CLEAVE AT SINGLE-BASE MISMATCHES REFRACTORY TO CLEVAGE WITH CURRENTLY KNOWN RIBONUCLEASES WILL BE DEVELOPED. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL BE TESTED USING A SERIES OF P53 GENES CONTAINING SINGLE-BASE MUTATIONS.",

Past measurements have been made with a submersible scanning spectroradiometer. In this study a design will be developed for a two-spectrometer instrument to measure simultaneously the surface irradiance with a standard cosine receptor and the underice irradiance by means of submersible cosine receptor-fiberoptic bundle coupled to the surface spectroradiometer. Three types of underwater cosine receptors will be tested. A modifcation to an existing PSII spectroradiometer will be made to accommodate a CCD area array detector, and temperature sensitivity to -30 degrees C will be measured. Scattered light measurmeents will be carried out on an existing LabSpec to test the holographic grating order separation filter combination for light leakage. An absorption filter will be specified to reduce the peak sensitivity region of the array to increase the dynamic range at short and long wavelength. An investigation will be made to define the best method to maintain a one hour battery charge life in temperatures reaching -30 degrees C. The Phase I study will last for six months.",

THIS PROJECT WILL PRODUCE A SUITE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS THAT WILL AUTOMATE A VARIETY OF ANALYSIS PROCESSES THAT ARE CURRENTLY PERFORMED MANUALLY. THE DEVELOPED ALGORITHMS WILL BE ABLE TO EXTRACT SOLAR FEATURES,SUCH AS FILAMENTS OR SUNSPOTS, FROM IMAGES THAT ARE TAKEN WITH A VARIETY OF WAVELENGTHS, AND WHICH ARE TAKEN UNDER VARYING CONDITIONS (DIFFERENT TELESCOPES, VARYING CLOUD COVER). SIX CLASSES OF ALGORITHMS WILL BE DEVELOPED UNDER THE TRACS PROJECT. IMAGE PREPROCESSING ALGORITHMS WILL CORRECT FOR VARIABLE OBSERVATION CONDITIONS. FEATURE EXTRACTION ALGORITHMS WILL EXTRACT THE DESIRED SOLAR FEATURES, AND FEATURE ANALYSIS ALGORITHMS WILL BE USED TO MEASURE AND IDENTIFY SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE FEATURES. FEATURE GROUPING ALGORITHMS WILL BE USED TO CONSTRUCT HIERARCHICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF IMAGE EVENTS, AND FEATURE TRACKING/PREDICTION ALGORITHMS WILL PERMIT A DESCRIPTION OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE FEATURES OVER TIME.

TWO PRIMARY REQUIREMENTS ARE THE SIMULATION OF MULTIPATH PHENOMENA AND UNINTENTIONAL INTRAPULSE MODULATIONS (UMOP). BOTH REQUIRE THE ABILITY TO GENERATE PRECISE AMPLITUDE, PHASE AND FREQUENCY MODULATION WITHIN THE PULSE, AND FOR MULTIPATH, TO SIMULATE THE DISTRIBUTED NATURE OF THE PULSE. THE ABILITY OF A DIGITAL RF MEMORY TO GENERATE HIGH RESOLUTION AMPLITUDE, PHASE, AND FREQUENCY MODULATIONS WITH TIMING RESOLUTIONS TO LESS THAN ONE NANOSECOND, MAKES IT A LIKELY CANDIDATE TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIRED SIMULATION CAPABILITIES. THE AVAILABILITY OF LOW COST PROCESSOR BOARDS TO PERFORM THE REALTIME CALCULATIONS TO CONTROL THE DRFM, MAKES THIS APPLICATION OF DRFM TECHNOLOGY BOTH FEASIBLE AND ECONOMICAL. PHASE I WILL PRODUCE A SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE FOR THE APPLICATION OF DRFM TECHNOLOGY TO BOTH MULTIPATH AND INTRAPULSE MODULATION SIMULATION. THE FINAL REPORT WILL INCLUDE PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE CANDIDATE ARCHITECTURE, INCLUDING RANGES AND RESOLUTIONS FOR ALL INTRAPULSE MODULATIONS. THE REPORT WILL ALSO OUTLINE ALGORITHMS AND UPDATE RATES FOR CONTROLLING MULTIPATH SIMULATION. A DESIGN FOR AN RF GENERATOR USING A DRFM TO PERFORM PRECISE INTRAPULSE MODULATIONS WILL BE DEFINED.",

IF THESE STUDIES ARE SUCCESSFUL, A FINAL PROTOTYPE WILL BE ASSEMBLED AND TESTED, WHERE COMPUTER-ADDRESSABLE ELECTRODE PAIRS WILL BE LOCATED ON THE FLOOR OF EACH WELL OF A STANDARD TISSUE CULTURE MULTIWELL PLATE. THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO DEVELOP THE ECIS INSTRUMENT INCORPORATING ELECTRODE ARRAYS FABRICATED USING STATE-OF-THE ART MANUFACTURING PROCEDURES. THE METHOD WILL THEN BE A PRACTICAL AND HIGHLY SENSITIVE MEANS TO MONITOR CELL BEHAVIOR FOR BOTH MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ARRAY OF 10-(4)CM(2) ELECTRODES FOR USE WITH A NEW INSTRUMENTAL METHOD FOR TISSUE CULTURE. THE METHOD, REFERRED TO AS ECIS (ELECTRIC CELL-SUBSTRATE IMPEDANCE SENSOR), IS A NON-INVASIVE TECHNIQUE TO MEASURE SEVERAL IN VITRO CELL PARAMETERS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY. THESE INCLUDE CELL MOTILITY, ADHESION AND SPREADING, MORPHOLOGY, AND THE BARRIER FUNCTIONS OF CELL LAYERS. THE ELECTRONICS AND SOFTWARE OF PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT. TO BE SUCCESSFUL, HOWEVER, A PRACTICAL METHOD OF FABRICATING ELECTRODES IS NOW REQUIRED.

HIGH QUALITY DIAMOND FILMS ARE PRESENTLY GROWN AT RATES OF ABOUT 1 MICRON/HR. CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY IS THE ATTAINMENT OF LARGER GROWTH RATES. ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE PLASMA TORCHES HAVE BEEN USED TO OBTAIN HIGH DIAMOND GROWTH RATES BUT ARE LIMITED TO SMALL AREAS. A HIGH POWER DENSITY, 1 KW/CM2 AT 200 TORR PRESSURE, MICROWAVE PLASMA DISCHARGE IS PROPOSED HERE TO DEMONSTRATE INCREASED GROWTH RATES BY AT LEAST ONE ORDER-OF-MAGNITUDE. A MICROWAVE DISCHARGE IS CHOSEN BECAUSEOF THE POTENTIAL OF SCALE-UP OF THE DEPOSITION AREA AND THE HIGH QUALITY FILMS WHICH ARE OBTAINED WITH THIS METHOD. A PARAMETER SPACE STUDY IN POWER DENSITY, NEUTRAL PRESSURE, SUBSTRATE TEMPERATURE AND PLASMA CHEMISTRY IS PROPOSED IN A SINGLE REACTOR. THIS WOULD HELP IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF THEMECHANISMS FOR DIAMOND GROWTH. A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE HIGH GROWTH RATE DIAMOND REACTOR COULD BE DESIGNED AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THIS RESEARCH.",

DIAMOND COATINGS NOT ONLY PROVIDE AN INSULATING LAYER BUT ALSO AVOID A THERMAL BARRIER THAT IS GENERATED BY THE CONVENTIONAL ELECTRICALLY-INSULATING COATINGS. IN ADDITION, THE USE OF A DIAMOND COATINGS CARRIERS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT ELECTRIC CIRCUIT PRINTS COULD BE DONE DIRECTLY ON THE HEAT SINK MATERIAL.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Monopole and dipole antennas have been determined to radiate most efficiently when the size of the antenna is proportional to the frequency being transmitted or received, i.e. one-quarter, one-half or one wavelength. As the operating frequency is varied from that ideal frequency nulls begin to develop which threaten the integrity of the communication link. Experience has shown that small excursions (+ 50% of the resonent frequency) can be achieved without degrading performance by use of matching devices. But, larger bandwidths such as 30 to 90 MHz are normally accommodated by active high impedence tuning devices and couplers. Experience has also shown that antennas which are located in close proximity to each other tend to limit each others performance unless electrical isolation on the order of 30 dB is achieved. Finally, antenna array performance is best achieved by reducing the potential for intra antenna reaction and complicity. This investigation will evaluate new low impedance passive broadbanding techniques which minimize array complexity, maximize intra antenna isolation to produce a low profile high performance vertical antenna array which supports two transceivers and operates in the 30 to 90 bandwidth.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal seeks to establish the feasibility model for a high- performance inexpensive multi-band IR processor based on morphological signal processing, to be incorporated into the Navy's next generation of IR fuzes. Our unique processing approach is based on very simple computational circuits which can be implemented in compact, high-speed, low-power, low- cost gate array logic. Furthermore this nonlinear processing approach has resulted in robust target detection performance, sometimes even exceeding state-of-the-art algorithms which require massive computation. This innovation has been demonstrated for one-dimensional as well as two- dimensional real sensor multi-band data. In Phase I we will: 1) determine the IR characteristics of air targets of interest and background clutter, 2) demonstrate short range detection of powered and unpowered air targets based on our simple processing approach, 3) use NAVSWC detector array output data to quantify detection performance, and 4) identify an appropriate family of IR-fuzed munitions and develop a high-level processor architecture specific for this application. The anticipated results of Phase I will be a proof of concept that reliable detection can be achieved within the IR fuze form factor. A hardware processor prototype will be built in a Phase II effort to fully test and validate the multi-band IR fuze.",

UNFORTUNATELY, SOME OF THESE LISTENERS CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFICULTY REALIZING SUBSTANTIAL SPEECH RECEPTION IMPROVEMENTS OVER SPEECH-READING ALONE WHEN EVALUATED WITH OPEN-SET CONNECTED SPEECH MATERIALS.

COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SENSORS FOR MONITORING INTRAUTERINE CONTRACTIONS USE CUMBERSOME BELTS AND LARGE AND BULKY SENSORS WHICH ARE UNCOMFORATABLE AND LIMIT THE PATIENT'S MOBILITY. A SMALL AND SIMPLE SELF-ADHERING INTRAUTERINE PRESSURE MONITOR HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. THE SENSOR CONSISTS OF AN AIR-FILLED SEMI-RIGID-WALLED DISPOSABLE BUBBLE THAT IS ATTACHED TO THE ABDOMEN BY AN ADHESIVE AND PRESSES SLIGHTLY INTO THE ABDOMINAL WALL SO THAT CHANGES IN INTRAUTERINE PRESSURE CAN BE MEASURED. THE DEVICE DEMONSTRATES AN EXCELLENT CORRELATION WHEN COMPARED TO A COMMERCIAL TOCODYNAMOMETER FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF CONTRACTION DURATION AND FREQUENCY. ONCE THE DESIGN IS OPTIMIZED, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE DISPOSABLE BUBBLLE MONITOR WILL BE A COMMERCIAL SUCCESS BECAUSE OF THE CONVENIENCE OF ATTACHMENT, LOWER NOISE, GREATER COMFORT, LOWER COST, AND CONVENIENCE AFFORDED TO THE NURSE AND TO THE PATIENT.",

POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES OF HIGH-ENERGY ELECTRON BEAM WELDING INCLUDE THE CAPABILITY OF MAKING VERY HIGH QUALITY WELDS IN VERY THICK AND/OR LARGE WORKPIECES AT OR ABOVE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURES. THE USE OF A HIGH-ENERGY ELECTRON BEAM OBVIATES THE NEED FOR THE NEAR-VACUUM ENVIRONMENT REQUIRED BY CONVENTIONAL ELECTRON-BEAM WELDING. THICKER WORKPIECES CAN BE ACCOMODATED BECAUSE OF THE DEEPER PENETRATION INTO THE WORKPIECE OF HIGHER-ENERGY BEAMS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSED EFFORT IS TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF HIGH-ENERGY ELECTRON BEAM WELDING BY (1) ANALYZING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE HIGH-ENERGY ELECTRON BEAM AND METALS AND (2) DEVELOPING A PRELIMINARY DESIGN FOR A REAL-TIME PROCESS MONITOR BASED ON THE USE OF THE X-RAYS EMITTED BY THE BEAM TO \"ILLUMINATE\" THE WELD PROGRESS. THE END PRODUCTS OF THIS EFFORT WILL BE (1) AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELEVANT INTERACTION PHYSICS; AND (2) THE BASIS FOR THE ENGINEERING DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF PROTOTYPE MONITOR HARDWARE. THESE END PRODUCTS WILL CONTITUTE THE FOUNDATIONS BOTH FOR A PHASE II SBIR EFFORT AND FOR EXPLORATORY DEVELOPMENT OF A PROTOTYPICAL HEEBW SYSTEM. HIGH ENERGY ELECTRON BEAM WELDING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FACILITATE MAKING WELDS OF VERY HIGH QUALITY IN VERY LARGE AND/OR THICK WORKPIECES. THE X-RAYS EMITTED BY THE BEAM IN INTERACTING WITH THE WORKPIECE CAN BE USED TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THE WELD IN REAL TIME. THESE FEATURES WILL PROVIDE ENHANCED WELDING CAPABILITIES IN MANY GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS; SHIPBUILDING IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The vibration signatures (mechanical, acoustic, and electromagnetic) produced by machine components may be used for machinery diagnostics. By regularly measuring vibration levels, defects can be detected and diagnosed before causing extensive damage or failure, a process known as predictive maintenance. The main advantage of predictive maintenance is that problems can be identified without disassembling a machine, or even removing it from service. Conventional machinery diagnostics generally require significant human involvement and expertise. Essential requirements include data pre-processing for feature extraction, detection of signals of interest, and classification of these signals. Automated systems often utilize deductive approaches that fail to capitalize on the benefits offered by inductive techniques such as neural networks; these benefits include performance advantages and reduced development and maintenance. Machine diagnostics is essentially a pattern- recognition task, for which neural networks are ideally suited due to their speed and ability to recognize complex high-dimensional relationships. Classification polynomial neural networks emphasize discrimination among fault classes and thereby offer advantages over estimation neural networks for diagnostics applications. Signal-processing and pattern-recognition algorithms, and the hardware on which they run, are sufficiently advanced for rapid on-line detection and classification of changes in the condition of electro-mechanical systems. -",

COLLECTIVE THOMSON SCATTERING (CTS) IS RECOGNIZED AS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE APPROACH FOR OBTAINING THIS INFORMATION. A CO2 LASER-PUMPED FAR-INFRARED (FIR) LASER, OPERATING AT A WAVELENGTH OF 100 MUM, APPEARS TO OFFER THE OPTIMUM SOURCE FOR THIS CTS APPLICATION. THIS LASER SOURCE COULD BE OPERATED IN A SINGLE LONG-PULSE ( 10 MUS), HIGH ENERGY ( 10 J/PULSE) MODE, OR IN A REPETITIVELY PULSED MODE ( 30 HZ) WITH MODERATE PULSE LENGTH ( 1 US) AND ENERGY ( 1 J/PULSE). THE FIRST MODE WOULD PROVIDE HIGH TEMPORAL RESOLUTION. THE LATTER MODE, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE INTEGRATING OVER 10 PULSES, COULD BE ACHIEVED WITH A COMPACT, LOW COST SYSTEM IN PHASE II. THE ADVANTAGES OF THE FIR SOURCE ARE (1) AVOIDANCE OF DENSITY LIMITS AND OF CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY PLASMA REFRACTION/EMISSION, AND LOWER COST RELATIVE TO GYROTRONS; (2) MUCH LOWER COST, SIZE, AND COMPLEXITY RELATIVE TO FREE-ELECTRON LASERS; AND (3) LARGER SCATTERING ANGLE AND A LOWER COST RECEIVER SYSTEM RELATIVE TO A CO2 LASER SOURCE. PHASE I FOCUSES ON DESIGN STUDIES FOR A LABORATORY PROTOTYPE FIR LASER SYSTEM. DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION IS PLANNED FOR PHASE II.",

Two aspects of the proposed route are unique in themselves and, combined, should permit the development of a low temperature, scalable production process, to make electronic grade LiNbO3 more widely available to the integrated circuit (IC) industry. Preparation and reaction of novel volatile or metallic alkoxide monomer precursors in CVD and sol-gel process experiments are described. Three approaches to highly localized, intrafilm annealing are also outlined. Each seeks to minimize heat transport to the silicon substrate during the annealing step required to form the crystalline LiNbO3 from a film deposited by a CVD or sol-gel process. These include rapid high-energy pulsed laser annealing, localized microwave annealing on a deposited sol-gel layer and a chemical exothermic reaction within the sol-gel derived film.",

MANY OF THESE SEPARATIONS INVOLVE REMOVING ORGANIC COMPOUNDS FROM AQUEOUS PROCESS STREAMS. SEVERAL TYPES OF CONVENTIONAL UNIT OPERATIONS ARE USED TO REMOVE OR DESTROY ORGANICS IN AQUEOUS PROCESS STREAMS, OR TO CLEAN UP GROUNDWATER THAT HAS BEEN CONTAMINATED WITH ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. HOWEVER, THESE UNIT OPERATIONS (E.G., CARBON ABSORPTION, STEAM STRIPPING, AND LIQUID/LIQUID EXTRACTION) CAN BE ENERGY INTENSIVE OR PRODUCE A SECONDARY WASTE STREAM (AQUEOUS OR GASEOUS) THAT MUST BE DISPOSED OF. SOME OF THESE PROCESSES ALSO DESTROY THE ORGANIC COMPOUND, PRECLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF RECOVERING OR RECYCLING THEM. REVERSE OSMOSIS (RO) IS A MEMBRANE-BASED PROCESS THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE AND SIMPLIFY WATER TREATMENT TECHNOLOGY. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH COMMERCIAL RO MEMBRANES DESALT WATER EFFICIENTLY-A TASK FOR WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN OPTIMIZED-THEY ARE NOT EFFECTIVE AT REMOVING MANY INDUSTRIALLY IMPORTANT ORGANICS FROM WATER. TO CAPITALIZE ON THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES OF RO MEMBRANES FOR ORGANICS REMOVAL, A NEW CLASS OF RO MEMBRANES THAT REMOVE HIGH PERCENTAGES OF ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS MUST BE DESIGNED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM IS DEMONSTRATION OF THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING RO MEMBRANES CAPABLE OF HIGH REJECTIONS OF ORGANIC MOLECULES AND HIGH WATER FLUXES. PHASE I EMPHASIZES PREPARATION OF SMALL MEMBRANE SAMPLES THAT HAVE A WATER FLUX OF 15 L/M2-HR (AT 55 ATM) AND A REJECTION OF PHENOL (THE TARGET ORGANIC CONTAMINANT) OF AT LEAST 98%. PHASE II WOULD CONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE MEMBRANES, MAXIMIZING THEIR FLUX AND ORGANIC REJECTION.

REVERSIBLE PROTEIN FOLDING DUE TO HYDROPHOBIC INTERACTIONS RESULTS FROM INVERSE TEMPERATURE TRANSITIONS WHERE FOLDING OCCURS ON RAISING THE TEMPERATURE. SINCE WARM-BLOODED ANIMALS PROVIDE AN INFINITE HEAT RESERVOIR, THE TRANSITION TEMPERATURE, TT, NOT THE ENDOTHERMIC HEAT, DETERMINES THE FOLDED STATE AT PHYSIOLOGICAL TEMPERATURES. AS THE TEMPERATURE IS RAISED THROUGH THE INVERSE TEMPERATURE TRANSITION, THE POLYPEPTIDE OR PROTEIN FOLDS BY HYDROPHOBIC INTERACTIONS INTO A MORE-ORDERED STATE. THE TEMPERATURE OF THE INVERSE TEMPERATURE TRANSITION, TT, CAN BE SHIFTED BY AN EXTERNAL VARIABLES; THEREFORE IT BECOMES POSSIBLE, ISOTHERMALLY, TO DRIVE THE FOLDING/UNFOLDING TRANSITION: (1) BY A CHANGE IN THE MEAN HYDROPHOBICITY OF THE POLYPEPTIDE (E.G., BY PROTONATION/DEPROTONATION OF A FUNCTIONAL SIDE CHAIN, BY ENZYMATIC PHOSPHORYLATION/DEPHOSPHORYLATION OF A SERINE MOIETY, ETC.), (2) BY A CHANGE IN THE SOLVENT COMPOSITION, (3) BY A CHANGE IN PRESSURE, AND, (4) BY A CHANGE IN OXIDATIVE STATE OF A PROSTHETIC GROUP. THE QUANTITATION OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH AMINO ACID TO THE TEMPERATURE OF THE INVERSE TEMPERATURE TRANSITION RESULTED IN A NEW HYDROPHOBICITY SCALE BASED ON THE VALUES OF TT FOR EACH AMINO ACID RESIDUE AS A GUEST IN A NATURAL REPEATING PEPTIDE SEQUENCE, THE HIGH POLYMERS OF WHICH EXHIBIT REVERSIBLE INVERSE TEMPERATURE TRANSITIONS. THE TRANSITION TEMPERATURE SCALE CAN SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT TRANSMEMBRANE HELICES FOR MEMBRANE PROTEINS. TO DEVELOP FURTHER RULES AND METHODOLOGIES FOR EXPERIMENTALLY DIRECTING PROTEIN FOLDING, IT IS NECESSARY SIMILARLY TO QUANTITATE THE EFFECTS OF A RANGE OF SOLVENT COMPOSITIONS ON SHIFTING THE VALUE OF TT FOR EACH RESIDUE, TO DETERMINE DISTANCE EFFECTS OF A RANGE OF SOLVENT COMPOSITIONS ON SHIFTING THE VALUE OF TT FOR EACH RESIDUE, TO DETERMINE DISTANCE EFFECTS IN HYDROPHOBICITY INDUCED PKA SHIFTS, AND TO DETERMINE HOW LARGE AN HYDROPHOBIC DOMAIN IS REQUIRED BEFORE IT CAN FOLD INDEPENDENTLY.

WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AN IMPROVED LARGE SCALE LIPOSOME MANUFACTURING PROCESS. WE PROPOSE TO DO SO BY REPLACING THE ORGANIC SOLVENTS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF LIPOSOMES WITH NEAR CRITICAL OR SUPERCRITICAL FLUID (SCF) SOLVENTS. WE ALSO PLAN TO EVALUATE THE USE OF SCFS AS A REPLACEMENT FOR LIPOSOME MANUFACTURING BY HIGH PRESSURE HOMOGENIZATION. THE DISPLACEMENT OF ORGANIC SOLVENTS WITH SUPERCRITICAL FLUID SOLVENTS IN THE LIPOSOMAL MANUFACTURING PROCESS WILL REDUCE THE DEGRADATION OF THE PHOSPHOLIPIDS AND ENCAPSULATEDTHERAPEUTICS AND ALLOW RAPID SOLVENT SEPARATION, RECOVERY AND REUSE. THERE ARE SEVERAL POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO THE PROPOSED PROCESSES OVER EXISTING LABORATORY AND COMMERCIAL PROCESSES FOR THE PREPARATION OF LIPOSOMES. THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS ARE: NON-USE OF ORGANIC SOLVENTS; TERMINAL STERILIZATION OF THE MANUFACTURED LIPOSOMES; AN OXYGEN FREE ATMOSPHERE; REPLACEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT HEATING EFFECTS WITH COOLING ONES; LOWER PRESSURE REQUIREMENTS WHEN COMPARED TO HIGH PRESSURE HOMOGENIZATION; LOWER O&M; COSTS; HIGHER SPEED OF PROCESSING; THE POTENTIAL FORMATION OF UNIFORM FATMLVS; THE ABILITY TO OPERATE CONTINUOUSLY; ANDSCALABILITY.",

ANALYZE IS A SOFTWARE SYSTEM FOR THE ANALYSIS OF MEDICAL IMAGES, DEVELOPED AT MAYO FOUNDATION'S BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPUTER RESOURCE. INCREASED PERFORMANCE WILL BE ACHIEVED BY IMPLEMENTING SELECTED PORTIONS OF ANALYZE ON A MULTIPLE PROCESSING ELEMENT (PE) ENVIRONMENT. FUNCTIONS OF ANALYZE FOR WHICH DECREASED IMAGE GENERATION TIME IS IMPORTANT, SUCH AS VOLUME RENDERING WILL BE SELECTED. NEXT, DETAILED PLANS WILL BE GENERATED TO PORT THE RELEVANT PORTIONS OF THE EXISTING CODE IN ANALYZE TO THE MULTIPLE PE ENVIRONMENT. THE IMPLEMENTATION WILL USE THE LINDA KERNAL STRATEGY WHICH ALLOWS AN ARBITRARY NUMBER OF PES TO BE UTILIZED. THIS STRATEGY INSURES THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY WORKSTATION USING THE MULTIPLE PE ARCHITECTURE CAN BE INCREASED BY SIMPLY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PES. THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IN PHASE II IS TO PRODUCE MULTIPLE PE BASED CIRCUIT BOARDS SUITABLE FOR INCORPORATION INTO EXISTING UNIX-BASED IMAGING WORKSTATIONS AND THE ASSOCIATED VERSION OF ANALYZE TO OPERATE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. THIS APPROACH WILL LEAD TO INCREASE THE UTILITY OF ANALYZE BY EXTENDING THE OPERATIONAL RANGE OF ANALYZE TO INCLUDE LARGER DATASETS WHILE MINIMIZING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SOFTWARE.

PRELIMINARY IN-VIVO EVALUATIONS OF OUR IOAT SYSTEM HAVE LEAD US TO REDEFINE THE DESIGN PARAMETERS. WE REBUILT OUR SYSTEM SO THAT IT COULD RESPOND TO THE RAPIDLY CHANGING OPERATING CONDITIONS, SUCH AS BLOOD FLOW RATE, HEMATOCRIT, AIR EMBOLI & FROTH, MACROAGGREGATES, IRRIGATING FLUID, SHEAR RATE, TRANSMEMBRANE PRESSURE, DURATION OF OPERATION, AND SYSTEMIC HEPARINIZATION. PHASE-I INVOLVES EXTENSIVE IN-VITRO STUDIES USING CALF AND HUMAN BLOOD WITH AN OBJECTIVE TO ESTABLISH THE CONSISTENCY OF PERFORMANCE OF OUR SYSTEM IN RESPONSE TO THE RAPID CHANGES IN OPERATING CONDITIONS. PHASE II INVOLVES EVALUATIONS IN CALVES, WHERE BLEEDING WILL BE SIMULATED IN OPEN CHEST CAVITY, AND THE SHED BLOOD WILL BE SALVAGED BY OUR IOAT SYSTEM.

SEVERAL NUCLEI HAVE HIGH CROSS SECTIONS FOR THERMAL NEUTRONS, OF WHICH BORON-10 ((10)B) AND GADOLINIUM-157 ((157)GD) HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE VERY PROMISING. (10)B HAS A HIGH CROSS SECTION FOR THERMAL NEUTRONS AND A VERY VERSATILE CHEMISTRY. (157)GD HAS THE HIGHEST CROSS SECTION FOR THERMAL NEUTRONS AND, BEING PARAMAGNETIC, IS GOOD FOR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING. A COMBINATION OF THESE TWO NUCLEI IN A SINGLE ENTITY SHOULD PROVIDE A SINGLE, MORE CONVENIENT WAY TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT TUMORS. PHASE I RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE SYNTHESIS OF A MOLECULE CONTAINING BOTH (10)B AND (157)GD AND ON EVALUATING ITS STABILITY, TOXICITY (LD50), AND IN-VITRO EFFICACY. PHASE II RESEARCH WILL BE CONCERNED WITH THE EVALUATION OF IN-VIVO EFFICACY, STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIP STUDIES TO OPTIMIZE EFFICACY AND DETERMINE THE PHARMACOKINETICS, TISSUE DISTRIBUTION, AND TOXICITY (SAFETY) OF LEAD COMPOUND(S).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A light induced phase grating in photorefractive crystals couple the optical fields of the pump and signals beam in a very similar way as a beam splitter combines the signal and local optical fields in a coherent optical communications receiver. The advantages of photorefractive crystals are: 1) the absence of 3db loss in the output intensity of the signal beam unlike in the case of 50/50 beam splitter and, 2) Ease of wave front alignment of the pump and signal beams. Using a InP as a photorefractive crystal these advantages have been demonstrated by Davidson et al [1]. Photorefractive gain in InP is very sensitive to temperature and is reduced due to the electron-hole competition [2] in the crystal. Photorefractive sensitivity of both CdTe:V and CdTe:Ge is better by about a factor of three the photorefractive beam coupling experiments in these crystals indicate absence of electron-hole competition mechanism. Optimizing the photorefractivity in CdTe:V, Ge will improve the homodyne detection at 1.06 micrometer. Moreover, the spin off of this development will be their applications to build optical components like phase conjugations for near IR wavelengths, optical limiters and optical switches.",

FULLERENCE, C60, IS A RECENTLY DISCOVERED FORM OF CARBON THAT HAS MASS, STABILITY, AND LOW IONIZATION POTENTIAL THAT MAKE IT AN EXCELLENT CANDIDATE FOR AN ION THRUSTER FUEL. A C60 ION THRUSTER COULD PROVIDE UP TO A FACTOR OF 30, INCREASE IN THRUST DENSITY OVER THE CURRENT PROPELLANTS AND A SIMULTANEOUS RELATIVE LOSS REDUCTION BY A FACTOR OF 55. THE HIGH THRUST DENSITY CAUSES A REDUCTION IN REQUIRED ACCELERATOR GRID AREAS TO A SIZE THAT IS PRACTICAL EVEN FOR LARGE MEGAWATT SIZE THRUSTERS.

WE HAVE DISCOVERED, USING NOVEL RAPID KINETIC METHODOLOGY DEVELOPED IN THE P.1.'S LABORATORY, THAT CERTAIN SUBSTITUTED GUANIDINES AND RELATED COMPOUNDS ARE ANTAGONISTS OF CALCIUM-DEPENDENT RELEASE OF GLUTAMATE AND DOPAMINE FROM BRAIN NERVE TERMINALS. ONE OF THESE EXHIBITS SELECTIVE BLOCK OF GLUTAMATE RELEASE. SUCH COMPOUNDS, WHICH WE HYPOTHESIZE TO ACT AS ANTAGONISTS OF PRESYNAPTIC CALCIUM-CHANNELS, MAY BE EMPLOYED AS DRUGS TO LIMIT ISCHEMIC BRAIN DAMAGE IN STROKE AND TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY PATIENTS. OUR GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY AND SYNTHESIZE ADDITIONAL SUBSTITUTED GUANIDINE DERIVATIVES OF IMPROVED POTENCY AND SPECIFICITY FOR BLOCKADE OF NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE. TO THAT END, WE WILL EMPLOY MOLECULAR MODELING TOOLS AND QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIP ANALYSIS. THEIR MECHANISM OF ACTION AND SELECTIVITY FOR ANTAGONISM OF PRESYNAPTIC CALCIUM CHANNELS WILL BE DEFINED BY ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL, RADIOISOTOPIC FLUX, AND RADIOLIGAND BINDING TECHNIQUES. THEY WILL BE TESTED FOR NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFICACY IN ANIMAL MODELS OF STROKE.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Increasingly, system designers and developers look to graphical user interface (GUI) technology to implement modern computer applications. But as software becomes easier to use, the development costs soar; for example, it is common to see the user interface constitute 60 % or more of applciation development costs. Though there have been significant recent advances in workstation technology and standardization of graphical software, full-functioned software tools to assist in developing GUIs are difficult to find. Of the tools that do exist, there is a glaring deficiency in that programmers--with considerable knoledge of the complexities of the underlying graphical software--are required to implement the user interface. The proposed project is for development of innovative software tools, the purpose of which is to increase productivity of the system developers and to increase the quality of the resulting user interfaces. The tools will cater to the non-programmer, so that end-users, system engineers, and human factors engineers may design and test GUIs from the end-user's perspective. The code name of this product is the \"CHI Toolset\", where CHI stands for \"Computer/Human iNterface\". The product will be based upon TAE Plus, a powerful and widely used UIMS developed for NASA by Century Computing.",

ALTHOUGH HIGH REMOVAL EFFICIENCIES ARE OBSERVED WITH THE CURRENT HIGH TEMPERATURE SORBENT DESULPHURIZATION APPROACHES, PROBLEMS EXIST WITH THESE SYSTEMS. THE PLANNED APPROACH UTILIZES INJECTION OF FINELY DIVIDED SORBENT INTO THE HOT GAS DUCTING DOWNSTREAM OF A HOT CERAMIC FILTER. THE H2S WOULD REACT WITH THE SORBENT AS THE GAS PASSES THROUGH THE DUCT AND BE REMOVED IN A SECOND CERAMIC FILTER AFTER SUFFICIENT RESIDENCE TIME TO COMPLETE THE SORBENT/H2S REACTION. THE PHASE I EFFORT IS ASSESSING THE APPROACH TO HOT DESULPHURIZATION USING SORBENT INJECTION.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT MULTIPLE TARGET RECOGNITION SYSTEMS IS LIMITED BY THE INCREASING SPEED OF MODERN WEAPON SYSTEMS, AND THE INCREASING NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF SENSORS. THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC OF SENSOR DATA IN MULTIPLE TARGET TRACKING IS THE UNCERTAINTY OF ITS ORIGIN. THIS UNCERTAINTY CAN ARISE NOT ONLY FROM CLUTTER, INTERFERENCE AND MULTI)3ATH EFFECTS, BUT ALSO FROM MULTIPLE TARGETS IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD. A HYBRID ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK AND EXPERT SYSTEM APPROACH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE OF CURRENT MULTIPLE TARGET TRACKING SYSTEMS. HERE, WE PROPOSE A HYBRID NEURAL NETWORK/EXPERT SYSTEM APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TARGET RECOGNITION BASED ON OUR IN-HOUSE HYBRID NEURAL NETWORK/EXPERT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT TOOL NUEX. IN PARTICULAR WE PROPOSETO DEVELOP A HYBRID NEURAL NETWORK KNOWLEDGE BASED MULTIPLE TARGET RECOGNITION SYSTEM, AND DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY BY IMPLEMENTING A PROTOTYPE DEMONSTRATION.

INTRAVENOUS (IV) DRUG USERS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS MAJOR VECTORS FOR THE SPREAD OF AIDS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION BECAUSE OF SHARING AND RE-USE OF HYPODERMIC NEEDLES. WITH NO VACCINE IN SIGHT AND RE-EDUCATION LONG AND SOMETIMES INEFFECTIVE, A TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION TO DISCOURAGE NEEDLE-SHARING IS IMPERATIVE. ONE SUCHSOLUTION IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPETITIVELY PRICED, SINGLE-USE AUTOMATICALLY AND PERMANENTLY RETRACTING SYRINGE.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Tunable, acousto-optic filters (AOTF) for operation in the UV-VIS-IR spectral ranges are important elements in the design of advanced sensors for target acquisition, and discrimination. Their small size, random-access wavelength selection, rapid scan rates, and all solid-state construction with no moving parts, provide an attractive alternative to monochromators and filter wheels, for many applications such as spectroscopy, analytical chemistry, clinical diagnostics, and on-line sensors for process control. Drawbacks of current AOTFs are (a) made from a single large birefringent crystal which may be difficult to obtain and expensive to manufacture, and (b) for a given design the angular aperture and spectral resolution characteristics are fixed. This work explores the use of non-crystalline polymer materials of variable birefringence for the design and fabrication of novel AOTFs of increased versatility and ruggedness, as well as significantly lower manufacturing costs.",

MAPPED RFLP PROBES ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR RESEARCH IN MANY AREAS. A SUBSET OF ABOUT 150 RFLP PROBES HAS BEEN SELECTED AND IS CURRENTLY BEING USED FOR MAPPING GENETIC DISEASE GENES AND STUDYING LOSS OF HETEROZYGOSITY IN TUMOR CELLS. CONVERTING THE SUBSET PROBES INTO PCR-BASED MARKERS WILL GREATLY FACILITATE THESE STUDIES BECAUSE PCR-BASED GENOTYPING METHODS ARE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OVER CURRENTLY USED GENOMIC SOUTHERN HYBRIDIZATION METHODS. THE OLIGONUCLEOTIDES DEVELOPED IN THIS RESEARCH WILL ALSO BE AN IMPORTANT RESEARCH PRODUCT FOR CONSTRUCTING PHYSICAL MAPS FOR HUMAN CHROMOSOMES. IN SOME CASES THEY CAN ALSO BE USED FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF GENETIC DISEASES AND TUMORS, AND FOR IDENTITY TESTING. IN PHASE I FEASIBILITY STUDIES, TWO PCR-MARKERS INVOLVING CA DINUCLEOTIDE REPEATS, WHICH ARE IN THE VICINITY OF THE ORIGINALLY MAPPED RFLP LOCI, WILL BE DEVELOPED. IN ADDITION, THE REGION FLANKING A DIMORPHIC RFLP WILL BE SUBCLONED AND SEQUENCED USING A RANDOM APPROACH. IN PHASE II, PCRS WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR THE ENTIRE SUBSET OF RFLP PROBES. OTHER METHODS SUCH AS DGGE (DENATURING GRADIENT GEL ELECTROPHORESIS), SSCP (SINGLE-STRANDED CONFORMATION POLYMORPHISM), INVERSE PCR AND VECTORETTE PCR WILL ALSO BE USED TO ACHIEVE THE OVERALL GOAL.",

THE TEST PORTION OF THE PROTOCOL RELIES ON ALLELE-SPECIFIC POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTIONS (PCR) TO PRODUCE AMPLIFIED PRODUCTS ONLY WHEN THE PRIMER SEQUENCES ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO THE LOCUS BEING TESTED. MANY OF THESE ALLELE-SPECIFIC PCRS WILL BE CARRIED OUT SIMULTANEOUSLY ON A SINGLE TEST SAMPLE OF DNA. THE EXISTENCE OF AMPLIFICATION PRODUCTS FROM THE VARIOUS PRIMERS WILL THEN BE DETERMINED BY MULTIPLEX CAPTURE OF THE PRODUCTS ON A SOLID SUPPORT BY HYBRIDIZATION BETWEEN SPECIFIC OLIGONUCLEOTIDES WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY ATTACHED TO THE SUPPORT. RESULTS WILL BE READ BY THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF LABELED AMPLIFICATION PRODUCTS AT EACH SPOT ON THE SUPPORT. LABELS WILL BE NONRADIOACTIVE SUCH AS BIOTIN-STREPTAVIDIN-HORSERADISH PEROXIDASE. HYBRIDIZATION TO THE TAIL COMPLEMENTS ON THE SOLID SUPPORT WILL BE BY CONVENTIONAL WATSON-CRICK HYDROGEN BONDING OR BY HOOGSTEEN BONDING IN A TRIPLE HELIX CONFIGURATION. IN THE LATTER CASE, NO DENATURATION OF THE PCR PRODUCTS WILL BE REQUIRED PRIOR TO HYBRIDIZATION. IN THIS NEW TEST, ALLELE-SPECIFIC PCR AMPLIFICATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED IN BATCHES OF ABOUT TEN PER DNA SAMPLE, BUT THE TEST IS EXPECTED TO PERMIT SIMULTANEOUS CAPTURE AND SELECTION OF PRODUCTS FROM HUNDREDS OF ALLELES ON A SINGLE SOLID SUPPORT.",

CO2 LASER TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN USED IN EFFORTS UP TO THE PRESENT. RECENT ADVANCES IN EYESAFE ( 1.4 UM) SOLID-STATE LASER AND LASER RADAR TECHNOLOGY POINT TO A MORE SENSITIVE, COMPACT, SHORTER WAVELENGTH ALTERNATIVE, HIGHLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF A RUGGEDIZED REMOTE VIBRATION SENSOR. IN PARTICULAR, A TM,HO:YAG CLR HAS RECENTLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY RESEARCHERS AT COHERENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. TO BE A VERY SENSITIVE, LONG-RANGE EYESAFE SYSTEM OPERATING AT 2.1 UM WAVELENGTH. OPERATION AT THIS WAVELENGTH WOULD RESULT IN A MINIMUM DETECTABLE VIBRATION AMPLITUDE OF ROUGHLY ONE-FIFTH THAT OF A COMPARABLE CO2 SYSTEM. RAPID ADVANCES IN DIODE-PUMPED 2 UM LASER TECHNOLOGY AT CTI AND ELSEWHERE STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT A HIGH POWER, CW SINGLE-FREQUENCY TM,HO:YAG TRANSMITTER IS FEASIBLE HAVING THE OUTPUT POWER AND FREQUENCY STABILITY REQUIRED FOR VIBRATION SENSING APPLICATIONS. THIS PHASE I EFFORT WILL DETERMINE THE PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF A 2 UM COHERENT VIBRATION SENSOR AND DEMONSTRATE A HIGH POWER (1-2W CW) DIODE-PUMPED TRANSMITTER PROTOTYPE. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - NUMEROUS MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS EXIST FOR A COMPACT, EFFICIENT EYESAFE REMOTE VIBRATION SENSOR. MACHINE VIBRATION ANAYLSIS IN INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENTS WOULD DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM THE PROPOSED INSTRUMENT.

        "abstract": "Abstract         1The development of quiet, high-reliability linear and rotary electromechanical actuators to operate independent of a central hydraulic plant is proposed. It is shown that the combination in an integral package of brushless DC motors and certain speed reducers, especially compudrive's patented orbidrive, affords the ideal solution to the requirement. Orbidrive is a gearless, concentric speed reducer which utilizes the cycloidal motion of a dual-faced, multi-lobed cam nutating on an eccentric shaft to effect desired speed reduction. The eccentric input shaft forces the cam to engage respective sets of rollers, each of which contains one more roller than the number of mating cam lobes, such that the cam is advanced exactly one lobe per input shaft rotation while the output shaft is retarded exactly one lobe per cam rotation. Torque transmission is thus accomplished via a rolling motion in contrast to the noisy sliding of mated gear teeth of conventional gear boxes. Phase I objectives of comprehensive analysis of the proposed approach and preliminary design of a linear and a rotary actuator are detailed. Phase II objectives of optimization, construction and testing of the linear and rotary actuators are outlined.",

VIDEO SEGMENTS SIMULATE JOB SITUATIONS THAT MIGHT BE ENCOUNTERED IN THE WORKING WORLD. THIS CURRICULUM-BASED ASSESSMENT WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED BY GREENAN AND WINTERS IN WRITTEN FORM (1986). INNOVATIONS SUCH AS PREDICTION AND USE OF OPTIMAL SIGN-LANGUAGE VERSION (AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE AND SIGNED ENGLISH), ABILITY TO CHANGE BETWEEN SIGN VERSIONS AT ANY TIME, AND USE OF COMPUTER GRAPHIC FINGER SPELLING FOR INPUT SELECTION ARE USED. PRELIMINARY INDICATIONS ARE THAT THIS APPROACH CAN BE ADAPTED TO PROVIDE A REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY FOR ASSESSMENT AND INSTRUCTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH VARIOUS DISABILITIES. THEREFORE,WE PROPOSE TO ADAPT THE SELF-HELP INTERPERSONAL SKILLS ASSESSMENT BY COLLECTING SALIENT FEEDBACK FROM DISABLED INDIVIDUALS AND EXPERTS ON HOW TO STRENGTHEN AND BROADEN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SYSTEM TO INCLUDE BOTH ASSESSMENT AND INSTRUCTION.

RECENT DECISIONS TO CONVERT FROM JP-4 JET FUEL TO THE LESS VOLATILE JP-8 JET FUEL MEANS THAT THE LIKELIHOOD FOR GROUND ENCOUNTER BY THE JETTISONED FUEL IS SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED. WHAT IS NEEDED, FOR NOT ONLY THE U.S. AIR FORCE BUT ALSO THE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY, IS A FULLY OPERATIONAL AND USER-FRIENDLY PERSONAL COMPUTER MODEL THAT PREDICTS THE FATE OF THE RELEASED FUEL WITH CONFIDENCE AND RELIABILITY, INCLUDING ITS DOWNWIND BEHAVIOR AND EVENTUAL GROUND FOOTPRINT DETAIL. CONTINUUM DYNAMICS INC. HAS DEVELOPED SUCH A MODEL FOR THE USDA FOREST SERVICE AND THE U.S. ARMY, TO PREDICT THE DISPERSAL OF AERIALLY RELEASED MATERIAL. IT IS THE GAUSSIAN LINE-SOURCE MODEL CALLED FSCBG. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD MODIFY FSCBG TO THE SPECIFICS OF U.S. AIR FORCE NEEDS REGARDING FUEL JETTISONING. THE USER INTERFACE, EXTENSIVE GRAPHICS CAPABILITY, AND EFFICIENT OPERATION ON PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ACHIEVED IN THE ORIGINAL MODEL FOR ITS ORIGINAL SPONSORS. EXTENSION TO THE TOP OF THE TROPOSPHERE, AND TO MULTICOMPONENT MIXTURES, COMPRISE THE ONLY MODIFICATIONS ANTICIPATED IN PHASE I.

These devices would be important for airborne radar systems, electronic warfare and countermeasure systems, and airborne and space-based communications systems. While conventional semiconductor materials such as SI and GaAs are already being used near their limits of output power and operating temperature, the potential of SiC is just beginning to be demonstrated. High temperature 6H-Sic MESFETs and JFETs have been demonstrated to 500 C. Physical modeling has shown that an ideal 1 um gate length 6H-SiC MESFET at 25 C would have a power density of 3.2 W/MM at 10 GHz (3-6 times higher than achievable in GaAs). Furthermore, this modeling has shown that if the MESFET were operated at 500, it would still have an output power of 1.6 W/mm at 10 GHz. While the room temperature potential of the SiC MESFET will very likely be achieved, there are some factors that could pervent a MESFET strcuture from meeting its potential at high temperature. The amount of gate leakage known to exist for Schottky contacts at 500-600C could degrade the RF performance of the devices. Therefore, it is proposed that 6H-SiC JFET structures be investigated for high temperature, high frequency operation. The JFET will take advantage of the much lower leakage current inherent in SiC pn junctions at high temperature due to the wide bandgap. This effort will include physical modeling (RT and 500C), design and fabrication of JFET structures. High temperatures RF measurements of both MESFET and JFET devices will also be performed. The most promising of these devices will be further developed in Phase II of this program. be performed. The most promising of these devices will be further developed in Phase II of this program.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Silicon carbide possesses a unique combination of properties, not available from other more common semiconductors, which allow it to operate in certain severe environments. These properties include a wide bandgap, a high melting point, high breakdown electric field, and high thermal conductivity, as well as excellent resistance to chemical attack and mechanical damage. As such, it is being examined throughout the world for employment in temperature, radiation and Exp resistant electronics, high frequency/high power devices as well as blue LEDs and UV photo- detectors. Although, the excellent properties of SiC have been known since the 1950'6, its development as a semiconductor has been severly limited until recently, primarily because of difficulty in growing high quality, large area, single crystal- line material from which to fabricate devices. The development of a process for growing single crystal boules of 6H-SIC at North Carolina State University and the further improvement in process control and crystal size and quality at Cree Research, Inc. has lead to rapid advances in SiC device development and performance. Cree is in production of the world's only commercially viable blue light emitting diode (LED) using 1 inch diameter wafers produced from these boules and is in the process of scaling up to 1.375 inch production. Cree has demonstrated a complete range of field-effect transistors (MOSFETs, MESFETs, and JFETs) in SiC which can operate at temperatures in excess of 4OOuC. In many high temperature applications, analog circuits will be needed to provide an interface to high temperature sensors or actuators. These circuits will be required to provide conditioning of low level sensor signals and the transmission of signals over long cables in noisy environments. It is proposed to develop 6H-SIC CMOS transistors during Phase I for insertion into an operational amplifier which can operate continuously at 350-C in Phase II.",

The benefits will be the identification of a new nonlinear optical material with large nonlinear properties suitable for SHG of laser diodes and solid state laser operating in the range less than 900nm.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Dynamic isolation of components and machinery is critical for many SDI and commercial applications. Vibration isolation using soft mounts leads to static misalignment, increased travel requirements, and decreased mount strength, often precluding this approach. The ideal isolator has high static (mount) stiffness, but low stiffness at disturbance frequencies. This SBIR will lead to a family of modern, two-axis \"smart hardmounts,\" mounts with adaptively tuned dynamic compliance characteristics that also possess high static stiffness. These hardmounts will place \"notches\" in the mount's stiffness at disturbance frequencies, sense changes, and adjust these \"notches\" to maintain isolation. The \"smart hardmounts\" will provide solutions to commercial (equipment for making computer chips) and military (cryocoolers and control moment gyros in spacecraft) problems that need both \"rigid\" mounts and dynamic isolation, but cannot tolerate soft, nonprecision mounting.",

THIS PROPOSAL FOLLOWS SUCH AN APPROACH AND OFFERS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN COMPLEXITY OF THE CONTROL SYSTEM, RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL COST AND WEIGHT SAVINGS. IT IS PROPOSED TO DO AWAY WITH THE TRADITIONAL USE OF THE SPEED SENSORS, THERMOCOUPLES, PRESSURE TRANSDUCERS, AND COMPLICATED ELECTRONIC CONTROL UNITS. INSTEAD, MAKE USE OF AN ELECTROHYDRAULIC METERING VALVE, WHICH BY MEANS OF PNEUMATIC FEEDBACK FROM THE ENGINE COMPRESSOR DISCHARGE PRESSURE (PCD) CAN CONTROL THE ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION OF THE ENGINE DURING STARTING AS WELL AS DURING THRUST ADJUSTMENTS. PCD BIAS WILL ALSO PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE ALTITUDE COMPENSATION. THE FUEL PRESSURE WILL BE PROVIDED BY AN ELASTIC, BLADDER TYPE, ACCUMULATOR; ALSO PRESSURIZED BY PCD. A SIMPLE ANALOG OR DIGITAL MICROCONTROLLER CAN BE USED TO SEQUENCE THE PYROTECHNIC DEVICES DURING START, AND CONVERT THE REQUIRED THRUST SETTINGS INTO SIGNALS FOR THE FUEL METERING VALVE. HOWEVER, BY COMBINING THE ELECTRONIC CONTROL FUNCTIONS WITH THAT OF THE VEHICLE, SUBSTANTIAL COST SAVINGS AND SIMPLIFICATION WILL RESULT. IN ADDITION TO REDUCING COST, THE PROPOSED DESIGN WILL REDUCE THE WEIGHT OF THE FUEL CONTROL SYSTEM RESULTING IN HIGHER THRUST TO WEIGHT RATIO.

THIS IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR RELATIVELY LOW-PERMEABLE SOILS. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A NEW PERMEAMETER TO DETERMINE VERTICAL SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY THAT IS ESPECIALLYADAPTABLE TO LOW-PERMEABLE SOIL. THE NEW METHOD WILL REDUCETHE TIME TO COMPLETE TESTS AND IT WILL LEAD TO MORE ACCURATERESULTS. UNLIKE ANY EXISTING FIELD PERMEAMETER, OUR METHOD WILL INCORPORATE MEASUREMENTS OF THE WETTING FRONT MOISTURE DISTRIBUTION TRANSIENT INFILTRATION. THIS MOISTURE DATA WILL BE COLLECTED BY A GEOPHYSICAL METHODS OR GRAVIMETRIC ANALYSIS. OUR GENERAL APPROACH IS TO FIRST REFINE THE MATHEMATICAL BASIS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF DATA. THE SECOND STEP IS FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT THAT WILL LEAD TO THE DESIGN OF THE PROTOTYPE THAT CAN BE CONSTRUCTED AND TESTED IN PHASEII.",

THE ACCEPTED TECHNIQUES FOR DETECTING SUCH LEAKS ARE BASED ON SLOW AIR SNIFFING SYSTEMS THAT DETECT THE MAJOR CONSTITUENT OF NATURAL GAS (METHANE) THROUGH CHEMICAL MEANS. ALTHOUGH AIR SNIFFING TECHNIQUES ARE SENSITIVE, THEY ARE SLOW AND MUST BE EMPLOYED IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE SUSPECTED LEAK. REMOTE OPTICAL DETECTION OF METHANE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED, BUT SYSTEMS BASED ON THIS TECHNIQUE HAVE BEEN TOO COMPLICATED FOR FIELD USE. A SENSOR APPROACH HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THAT USES A SEMICONDUCTOR DIODE LASER SOURCE. CALCULATIONS SHOW THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH A SYSTEM WILL EQUAL OR EXCEED THAT OF THE COMMERCIAL SNIFFER DEVICES. BECAUSE IT USES A DIODE LASER, THIS DEVICE CAN ALSO BE INTEGRATED INTO A SMALL, BATTERY-OPERATED PACKAGE FOR HANDHELD OPERATION. IN PHASE I, A LABORATORY VERSION OF THE DEVICE WILL BE CONSTRUCTED, AND ITS SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO WILL BE MEASURED. THIS INFORMATION IS BEING COMPARED WITH EXPECTATIONS FROM CALCULATIONS AND USED TO PREDICT THE PERFORMANCE OF AN OPTIMIZED PROTOTYPE DESIGN WHICH WOULD BE CONSTRUCTED AND TESTED IN PHASE II.",

ALTHOUGH WELL KNOWN AS A CRITICAL PARAMETER IN THE ENERGY-EFFICIENT PRODUCTION OF QUALITY STEEL, OXYGEN CONTENT IS CURRENTLY MEASURED USING A DISPOSABLE ZIRCONIA SENSOR CAPABLE OF ONLY INTERMITTENT OPERATION. DESPITE THE FACT THAT FUNDAMENTALLY NOTHING HAS PRECLUDED THE USE OF SUCH A ZIRCONIA-BASED SENSOR FOR CONTINUOUS DETERMINATION OF OXYGEN CONTENT, TWO MAJOR OBSTACLES HAVE PREVENTED THIS IMPORTANT TECHNICAL ADVANCE. FIRST, THE SIMULTANEOUS AND CONTINUOUS TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT REQUIRED BY THE ZIRCONIA CELL WAS NEVER AVAILABLE; SECOND, ZIRCONIA IS VERY SENSITIVE TO THERMAL SHOCK. OVERCOMING THESE OBSTACLES REQUIRES THE USE OF SPIN-OFF TECHNOLOGY FROM EARLIER EFFORTS THAT LED TO A SHOCK-RESISTANT CONTINUOUS TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT DEVICE SUITABLE FOR STEEL MILL SERVICE. IN PHASE I, A ROBUST ZIRCONIA CELL WITH AN ABLATIVE CAP IS BEING DESIGNED, FABRICATED, AND ITERATIVELY TESTED UNTIL A CONFIGURATION CAPABLE OF DIRECT IMMERSION IS ACHIEVED. THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED CONTINUOUS TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY WILL THEN BE ADAPTED FOR CLOSE PROXIMITY MEASUREMENT TO THE ZIRCONIA CELL.

THE SYSTEM WILL BE APPLICABLE TO THE NEW PYROCHEMICAL NUCLEAR FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY UNDER DEVELOPMENT AT THE ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY IN SUPPORT OF THE INTEGRAL FAST REACTOR CONCEPT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF NUCLEAR REACTORS. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL APPLY THE PRINCIPLE OF THERMAL DIFFERENTIAL LIQUID LEVEL MEASUREMENT IN WHICH INTERFACES BETWEEN FLUIDS HAVING DIFFERENT HEAT TRANSFER CHARACTERISTICS ARE DETECTED BY THE DIFFERENCES IN RESISTANCE OF ELECTRICALLY HEATED ELEMENTS RELATIVE TO UNHEATED ELEMENTS IMMERSED IN, BUT ELECTRICALLY INSULATED FROM, THE FLUIDS. THE SYSTEM MUST OPERATE IN CORROSIVE FLUIDS AT A TEMPERATURE OF 500 DEGREES CENTIGRADE OR HIGHER AND IN THE HIGH NUCLEAR RADIATION ENVIRONMENT ASSOCIATED WITH FUEL REPROCESSING. IT MUST ALSO BE SIMPLE IN CONCEPT, RELATIVELY LOW IN COST, RUGGED, HAVE AN ACCURACY OF BETTER THAN 0.125 IN., BE REMOTELY INSERTABLE AND REMOVABLE FROM THE SYSTEM, AND BE RELIABLE AND SAFE IN OPERATION.

        "abstract": "Abstract         In this project, a taxonomy of motor dysfunction will be developed for children ages 1 to 42 months who have movement disorders. Included are several research steps: * Cluster analysis of performance of Motorically Challenged children (n = 250) to determine if specific subgroups can be uncovered, * concurrent and discriminative validity studies (n = 125 Normals and 250 Challenged) on a new procedure for analyzing Quality of Movement and on the Bayley Motor Scale to determine if groups can be differentiated, * development of a system to ascertain if children fit into one of the empirically derived groupings of motor dysfunction, and * expanding the knowledge base in Motor Dysfunction, developing a theoretical model which accounts for variance within the group of Motorically Challenged young children. Previous approaches to the diagnostic assessment of motor functioning typically have focused on tabulating units of motor skill or motor milestones and not on assessment of qualitative aspects of movement, such as transitions between positions and maintenance of stable functional positions. The techniques which emerge from this research will assist in designing treatment programs for children with motor delays and dysfunction. They will also be beneficial in diagnostic assessments of children with motor challenges and in treatment efficacy research.",

LIGHT METAL COMBUSTION PRODUCES EXTREMELY HIGH FLAME TEMPERATURES.

HOWEVER, THESE ASSAYS WERE CONSTRUCTED USING WELL-CHARACTERIZED PHAGES; THE CONSTRUCTION OF ASSAYS FROM POORLY CHARACTERIZED PHAGES WITHDESIRABLE BIOLOGICAL SPECIFICITIES PRESENTS A MORE FORMIDABLE TASK. DURING PHASE I OF THE RESEARCH, A FAMILY OF SELECTABLE TRANSPOSONS, BASED ON TN5 AND OPTIMIZED FOR MUTAGENESIS OF BACTERIOPHAGES, WILL BE DEVELOPED AND CHARACTERIZED. THE MOST EFFECTIVE OF THESE TRANSPOSONS WILL BE USED TO RAPIDLY IDENTIFY REGIONS OF PHAGE DNA THAT ARE SUITABLE TARGETS FOR INTRODUCTION OF AN ICE NUCLEATION REPORTER GENE. DURING PHASE II, THIS TRANSPOSON IDENTIFICATION METHOD WILL BE USED TO CONSTRUCT A SET OF PHAGES THAT TOGETHER IDENTIFY ALLOF THE CLINICALLY IMPORTANT SEROTYPES OF SALMONELLA.",

THE COMPLETE SYSTEM WILL INCLUDE ROBOTIC REACTION PREPARATION, HIGH CAPACITY GEL ELECTROPHORESIS SYSTEM, ROBOTIC GEL LOADING AUTOMATIC GEL FILM READER AND SOFTWARE FOR MANAGING THE DATA. THE SPECIFIC AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS LIMITED TO DEVELOPMENT OF ONE COMPONENT, THE ROBOTIC DNA SEQUENCE REACTION ROBOT. THE GOAL IS A ROBOT WITH THE CAPABILITY TO PREPARE 96 DNA SAMPLES IN TWO TO FOUR HOURS YIELDING 384 SAMPLES FOR GEL LOADING WITHOUT THE NEED FOR INTERVENTION BY A HUMAN OPERATOR. THIS PROCESS AS CONVENTIONALLY DONE BY HAND WOULD INVOLVE OVER 1200 INDIVIDUAL STEPS OF PIPETTING AND WOULD HAVE TO BE REPEATED HUNDREDS OF TIMES IN ANY LARGE SEQUENCING PROJECT. BECAUSE OF THE LABOR INVOLVED AS WELL AS THE NEED FOR ACCURACY, THE MANUAL METHOD SIMPLY CANNOT BE CONTEMPLATED ON THE SCALE REQUIRED FOR LARGE SEQUENCING PROJECTS. THE HIGH ACCURACY, REPRODUCABILITY AND CONVENIENCE AFFORDED BY THE ROBOT, COMBINED WITH THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF DNASTAR'S HIGH THROUGHPUT DNA SEQUENCING SYSTEM WILL SUPPORT THE CAPABILITY TO DETERMINE 50,000 OR MORE BASIS OF RAW SEQUENCE PER DAY. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE ROBOT CAN BE MANUFACTURED INEXPENSIVELY ENOUGH TO BE PLACED ON THE MARKET AT LESS THAN $30,000.",

IN THE PROPOSED PROGRAM, A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT WILL BE PERFORMED TO FURTHER CONFIRM THE SHEAR INITIATION THEORY. IN ADDITION, A STUDY WILL BE MADE TO IDENTIFY ALL SOLID PROPERTIES THAT MAY AFFECT THE SENSITIVITY OF ENERGETIC MATERIALS. THESE PROPERTIES INCLUDE: STRESS-STRAIN CURVE UNDER HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE, VISCOSITY, AND SPECIFIC HEATS. THE EFFECT OF INITIAL CRACK SIZE ON THE HOT SPOT GENERATION WILL ALSO BE STUDIED. TEST METHODS IN MEASURING THESE PROPERTIES WILL BE RECOMMENDED. HYDROCODES WILL BE MODIFIED TO INCLUDE THESE SOLID PROPERTIES, SUCH THAT THEY CAN BE USED AS DESIGN TOOLS FOR MUNITION SENSITIVITY CALCULATIONS.

CURRENT METHODS FOR THE DETECTION OF PATHOGENS OR THEIR INDICATOR ORGANISMS TYPICALLY REQUIRE AT LEAST 24 HOURS, AND PERHAPS AS MUCH AS SEVERAL DAYS. RECENT AND ONGOING ADVANCES IN GENE AMPLIFICATION AND RELATED MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGIES OFFER THE PROMISE OF DEVELOPING A SYSTEM THAT CAN BE USED TO CHARACTERIZE THESE PATHOGENS OR THEIR INDICATORS IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME NOW REQUIRED. BY BUILDING UPON THIS PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND BY THE ADDITION OF OTHER INNOVATIVE COMPONENTS TO ENHANCE THE TECHNOLOGY, AN ANALYTICAL CHARACTERIZATION SYSTEM MAY BE DERIVED TO PROVIDE EXTREME SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE REQUISITE FEASIBILITY ELEMENTS LEADING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FIELD PORTABLE METHOD FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF PATHOGENS AND THEIR INDICATORS IN WATER. THIS CONCEPT AND THE ATTENDANT DETECTOR TECHNOLOGY IS EXPECTED TO BE CAPABLE OF BEING EXTENDED TO PROVIDE SIMILAR CHARACTERIZATIONS OF A BROAD VARIETY OF PATHOGENIC BIOMOLECULES.",

THE PROPOSED WORK IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF COMBINING SPECTROSCOPIC, ELECTROCHEMICAL AND FIBER OPTIC TECHNIQUES. SPECTRO-ELECTROCHEMICAL FIBER OPTIC SENSING (SEFOS) IS, IN PRINCIPLE, A GENERIC TECHNIQUE WHICH CAN BE ADAPTED TO MANY DIFFERENT SENSING APPLICATIONS. THE INCORPORATION OF SPECTROSCOPIC DETECTION, SUCH AS FLUORESCENCE, SHOULD ENABLE MANOMOLAR LIMITS (I.E., PPB LEVELS OR LESS), UNLIKE ELECTROCHEMICAL METHODS WHICH ARE GENERALLY LIMITED BY BACKGROUND CURRENTS DUE TO IMPURITIES AND NON-FARADAIC PROCESSES. THE TECHNIQUE HAS AN ADVANTAGE OVER CURRENT FIBER OPTIC CHEMICAL SENSING METHODS IN THAT THE SENSING ONLY TAKES PLACE WHEN THE ELECTRODE DEVICE IS TURNED ON. THIS ENABLES LONG-TERM MONITORING OF A WELL/SITE TO BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH ONLY ONE SEFOS PROBE.

Utilizing the Metal Hydride electrode, which stores hydrogen for reaction, results in a battery that operates at lower pressure and is more compact than gaseous nickel-hydrogen batteries and contains no cadmium which presents toxic and disposal problems.Combining the features of the hydride electrode with improved nickle electrodes and packaging it, it is possible to construct batteries one and one-half to two times better in energy and power density than conventional nickel cadmium and nickle hydrogen batteries. In the Phase I design, single cell experiments and complete battery designs will demonstrate the capabilities of this system. The experimental cells will contain flat single 100 cm2 electrodes of various hydrides, electrode formulations, nickel electrodes of conventional sintered type and improved composite structures. A novel flat plate packaging approach will be evaluated for improved power and energy density. This battery is a viable candidate for military, medical, consumer electronics, and electric vehicle applications.",

The permalloy layer serves as the non-volatile memory storage medium while the InSb Hall element acts as the high-speed memory readout. The RAM can be built by very large scale integrated-circuit (VLSI) technology. The densely-packed memory cells will be integrated to high electron mobility transistor circuits previously processed on the GaAs. By virtue of InSb's high mobility and extremely fast and low noise HEMT driver, an access time less than 5 nanosecond and a packaging density greater than 1 M bit/cm2 are achievable; these characteristics are superior to those of the state-of-the-art static, non-volatile RAM. Because the magnetization of the permalloy is not affected by high-energy radiation with a semi-insulating substrate, this RAM is ultra-radiation hard.",

Two to three times higher chip density in digital MCMs will reduce signal amplitude losses, signal ground bounce and clock distribution variation. As digital clock speeds increase, power and ground line impedance can limit dynamic and static noise margins. Compared to conventional devices, ECSI interconnects will extend this limit two to three times. ECSI's proprietary technology will deliver superior products at high yields at reduced cost.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The basic scientific understanding acquired in development of electrokinetic remediation technology displays its potential in insitu removal of heavy metals, radionuclides and some organic chemicals from soils. One specific problem associated with the current processing technique is precipitation of the metal close to the cathode as a metal hydroxide. When this precipitate forms a lowly conductive salt, the electrical potential difference across the cell may increase decreasing the efficiency of removal and increasing the cost of remediation. There is a need to devise enhanced processing techniques to remove and/or avoid the precipitate close to the cathode. This study will investigate the use of acetic acid and/or ammonium acetate buffers to circumvent the encountered problem and enhance removal of metals in electrokinetic remediation. There are two advantages to using acetic acid in depolarizing the cathodic processes; (1) most metal acetates are highly soluble and the hydrogen ion is able to depoarize the cathodic electrlysis reaction thereby reducing the energy necessary in electrolysis and avoiding formation of the hydroxide species; (2) migration of an acetate anion upstream will cause formation of neutral acid and hence maintain a lower conductivity due to the association.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The key potential advantages of the bulk loaded liquid propellant gun (BLPG), relative to the regenerative liquid propellant gun (RLPG), currently under development, include simplicity, reliability, weight, size and performance. The single and limiting disadvantage of the BLPG concept has been lack of assured combustion control which, on occasion, has resulted in unacceptable damage levels in the gun. It has been observed in electrically ignited BLPG firings that extremely precise ignition timing is possible and that associated initial pressure rise rates are highly reproducible. It is the objective of the proposed Phase I Program to investigate the application of precision multipoint electrical ignition as a means of controlling the BLPG combustion process.",

Sequential exposure of reactants using a commercial microwave Plasma Enhanced Atomic Layer Epitaxy reactor is proposed to grow high quality GaN films. The technique allows two dimensional layer-by-layer growth which reduces nitrogen vacancies commonly observed in the GaN films. PE-ALE also allows deposition at reduced growth temperatures, which can reduce the loss of nitrogen from the solid phase during growth. A movable mechanical barrier is used to divide the chamber into multiple zones. Each zone can supply source gas, purging hydrogen or excited nitrogen. The substrate, which continuously rotates beneath the barrier, is alternately exposed to the individual gases. Each revolution will result in one monolayer of GaN deposition. Since the growth rate of one monolayer per cycle is insensitive to growth parameters, uniform films over a large area can be obtained.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS EXAMINATION OF THE FEASIBILITY OF REMOVING TRACE CONTAMINANTS FROM HOT COAL-GAS. AFTER DESULFURIZATION BY PRELIMINARY HOT-GAS CLEANING, COAL-GAS MUST BE FURTHER POLISHED TO REMOVE A NUMBER OF TRACE CONTAMINANTS TO LEVELS OF LESS THAN 1 PPM. SUCH POLISHING BY GAS SCRUBBING CAN BE ACHIEVED BY VERY INTIMATE CONTACT OF FUEL WITH A NONCONTAMINATING, HIGH TEMPERATURE LIQUID SORBENT IN A FINAL GUARD REACTOR. SOLID SORBENTS SUCH AS ZINC FERRITE WORK WELL FOR INITIAL HOT DESULFURIZATION OF COAL-GAS, BUT THEY ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY ACTIVE TO COMPLETELY CLEAN VERY HIGH SULFUR GASES DOWN TO THE FRACTIONAL PPM LEVELS REQUIRED IN ALMOST ALL APPLICATIONS. ZINC FERRITE ALSO CANNOT REMOVE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HC1), WHICH IS THE SECOND MOST DETRIMENTAL TRACE SPECIES AT UP TO 500 PPM IN COAL-GAS. UNTIL NOW, THE PRODUCTION OF A COAL-GAS COMPATIBLE WITH GAS TURBINE, DIESEL ENGINE, AND FUEL CELL SYSTEMS HAS REQUIRED THE USE OF EITHER COLD-GAS CLEANUP SCRUBBERS OR THE SELEXOL SYSTEM, BOTH OF WHICH USE AMINE SOLVENTS. HOWEVER, COLD SCRUBBING ALWAYS ENTAILS THE EXPENSE OF ENORMOUS HEAT EXCHANGERS TO REHEAT THE CLEANED GAS FOR MOST EFFICIENT USE. THE POLISHING METHOD BEING STUDIED IS EXPECTED TO REACTIVELY ABSORB HYDROGEN SULFIDE (H2S), HC1, AND MANY OTHER TRACE CONTAMINANTS SUCH AS MERCURY, ARSENIC, AND LEAD. PHASE I ATTEMPTS TO SHOW UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT THIS CONCEPT REPRESENTS A VIABLE APPROACH TO THE COMPLETE HOT CLEANUP AND POLISHING OF COAL-DERIVED FUEL.

Large power will be needed to drive advanced Propulsion and armaments (e.g. directed energy weapons) on the ships of this fleet. High-speed surface ships could be hydrofoils of cruiser class tonnage. With sufficient electric drive power these could cruise at 100-160 kts, and present very poor targets for attack while giving complete local control of the sea surface. fn addition, much higher-power submarines, running on radiation-free quiet direct-electric drive, would expand the strike and defensive capabilities of the current undersea fleet. Concurrently, deployment of major manned space ships as space-based battle stations, with high-energy electric lasers for space and sea surface attack, would give the Navy great surveillance and monitoring capabilities, as well as enhanced communications. This sub/sea/space Navy of the 21st Century . could provide complete control of the sea lanes on a global basis. All three systems require a new order of electric power system performance. The proposed program will analyze a new concept for direct fusion-electric power, with no nuclear radiation hazards and little waste heat loads, currently DoD-funded, for such power systems, and apply these to future Navy missions.",

We have developed functionally system hardware, including lenses, prismatic cell covers, single- and tandem-junction cells, and small arrays. This hardware has verified world-record performance levels for lenses, cells, and arrays. The present optical element is a small, dome-shaped, point-focus Fresnel lens. This \"mini-dome\" lens offers outstanding performance, but is relatively expensive to make and needs full two-axis sun-tracking. However, by replacing the mini-dome lens with an innovative line-focus lens, a more-manufacturable, lower-cost, simpler-tracking array can be realized. The Phase 1 objective is to design, build, and test prototype line-focus Fresnel lenses.

A NOVEL APPROACH TO IMPROVING OXYGEN AVAILABILITY IN AEROBIC CULTURES IS TO INTRODUCE IN THE HOST CELLS GENES CAPABLE OF PRODUCING PROTEINS WHICH CAN MODIFY CELL METABOLISM TO UTILIZE THE AVAILABLE OXYGEN MORE EFFICIENTLY. IN THIS WORK, VITREOSCILLA HEMOGLOBIN WILL BE EXPRESSED IN A STRAIN OF STREPTOMYCES RIMOSUS WHICH PRODUCES THE COMMERCIAL ANTIBIOTIC OXYTETRACYCLINE (OTC). SINCE OTC PRODUCERS ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO DISSOLVED OXYGEN CONCENTRATION, THE APPLICATIONOF THE HEMOGLOBIN TECHNOLOGY TO OTC PRODUCTION HAS POTENTIAL FOR MAJOR BENEFITS. FUNCTIONAL VITREOSCILLA HEMOGLOBVIN WILL BE EXPRESSED IN A STRAIN OF S. RIMOSUS WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN USD IN COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION OF OTC. THE HEMOGLOBIN GENE WILL BE CLONED AND EXPRESSED IN S.

These human characteristics are imposed upon non-human systems such as missile trackers and robotic vision. Such systems designed to perform simple tasks do not require complex human characteristics, and could be modeled after less sophisticated creatures such as insects. Position determination could be accomplished by coupling a neural network to a multi-aperture vision system. The neural network, acting as the insect visual processor, would use a training set of data with specified inputs and outputs. Once the training set has established the response of the system, the network is considered \"trained\" and can be programmed to respond in a similar manner to other input function. The insect ommatida, or eyelets, will be constructed using gradient index lenses, fiber optics, and detectors. The system will be \"trained\" and then stimulated by arbitrary object positions to obtain its response.",

THE MICRO-PULSES OR BUNCHES ARE PRODUCED BY RESONANTLY AMPLIFYING A CURRENT OF SECONDARY ELECTRONS IN A RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) CAVITY. BUNCHING OCCURS RAPIDLY AND IS FOLLOWED BY SATURATION OF THE CURRENT DENSITY WITHIN TENS OF RF PERIODS. ONE WALL OF THE CAVITY IS HIGHLY TRANSPARENT TO ELECTRONS BUT OPAQUE TO THE INPUT RF FIELD. THE TRANSPARENT WALL ALLOWS FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF THE ENERGETIC ELECTRON BUNCHES AND SERVES AS THE CATHODE OF A HIGH VOLTAGE INJECTOR. AXIAL AND RADIAL EXPANSION OF THE PULSE IS MINIMIZED OUTSIDE THE CAVITY BY USING RAPID ACCELERATION AND A COMBINATION OF ELECTROSTATIC AND MAGNETIC FOCUSING. INSIDE THE CAVITY, RADIAL EXPANSION IS CONTROLLED BY AN AXIAL MAGNETIC FIELD. BOTH ANALYTIC THEORY AND PARTICLE-IN-CELL SIMULATION VERIFY THIS CONCEPT. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS YIELDS THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE PARAMETERS: WITH THE CAVITY OPERATING AT 6.4 GHZ, A 5 PS, 9.3 KA MICRO-PULSE IS PRODUCED AT AN ENERGY OF ABOUT 50 KEV; THE PULSE IS THEN ACCELERATED IN A FIELD GRADIENT OF 20 MV/M TO 2 TO 4 MEV, WHERE THE PULSE WIDTH HAS INCREASED BY ABOUT 2 PS.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I PROGRAM IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF STRIPPING THE GROUNDWATER WITH A RECIRUCLATING AIR STREAM THAT IS DEPLETED WITH OXYGEN (ANOXIC). RECENT CLEAN-AIR REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT STRIPPING OFF-GASES BE PURIFIED BEFORE RELEASE TO THE ATMOSPHERE. ONCE THE CONTAMINANT VOCS HAVE BEEN REMOVED, HOWEVER, THE STRIPPING AIR CAN BE RECYCLED. IF THIS RECIRCULATING STREAM IS HEATED BY INJECTION OF FLUE GAS FROM A GAS BURNER, IT WILL BECOME DEPLETED IN OXYGEN AND RICH IN CO2. THE TREATMENT COSTS ARE ESSENTIALLY ZERO SINCE THE HEATING IS, IN ANY CASE, REQUIRED FOR THE GAS PURIFICATION STEP. WATERS WITH HIGH PH/HIGH ALKALINITY MAY ADDITIONALLY REQUIRE PH REDUCTION BY ACID ADDITION FOR EFFECTIVE FOULING CONTROL.

IN THIS PHASE I PROGRAM WE WILL USE OUR PROPRIETARY EXTRUSION TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE LCP FILMS THAT HAVE BARRIER PROPERTIES THAT ARE 1 TO 3 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE SUPERIOR THAN TODAY'S BEST COMMODITY BARRIER FILMS SUCH AS PVDC, PAN AND EVOH. THE BARRIER PROPERTIES FOR OUR BIAXIALLY ORIENTED LCP SUBSTRATES ARE AS FOLLOWS: OXYGEN - 0.008 CC-ML/ 100 IN.SQ-DAY-ATM, WATER VAPOR - 0.0036 GM-ML/LOO IN.SQ-DAY-ATM. OUR LCP FILMS ALSO ARE MICROWAVE COMPATIBLE, FDA APPROVED, CHEMICALLY INERT, RETORTABLE, MECHANICALLY STRONG, AND ARE READILY FORMED INTO MULTI-PLY LAMINATES THAT CAN BE THERMOFORMED AND THERMALLY SEALED. WE WILL PRODUCE LCP BARRIER LAMINATES THAT CAN BE EVALUATED FOR OXYGEN AND WATER VAPOR PERMEABILITY, AND SEALABILITY. A PREDICTION OF THE ANTICIPATED SHELF LIFE ALSO WILL BE DEVELOPED USING INDUSTRY DATA AND MEASURED SUBSTRATE PERMEABILITIES.",

ONE OF THE MORE DIFFICULT APPLICATIONS TO ADDRESS IS THE COOLING COMPONENTS ASSOCIATED WITH GUIDED MISSILE WEAPON SYSTEMS, WHICH PRESENTLY EMPLOY EITHER CFC-12 OR HCFC-22. FINDING SUITABLE ZERO ODP SUBSTITUTE REFRIGERANTS FOR THESE APPLICATIONS IS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT, BECAUSE MUCH OF THE COOLING IS UNIQUE TO GUIDED MISSILES AND THE HARDWARE IS INTEGRAL TO THE ENTIRE WEAPONS SYSTEM. ALTERNATE REFRIGERANTS MUST BE EMPLOYED IN A FASHION THAT MINIMIZES THE NEED FOR ALTERATION TO THIS HARDWARE, WHILE STILL MEETING DESIGN COOLING REQUIREMENTS. LEADING CANDIDATE REFRIGERANTS THAT HAVE LITTLE OR NO IMPACT ON ATMOSPHERIC OZONE INCLUDE HFC'S AND REFRIGERANT BLENDS OF HFC'S AND HCFC'S. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL EXAMINE THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF EACH COOLING SYSTEM AND DETERMINE THE ALTERNATE REFRIGERANT THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED WITH MINIMAL HARDWARE CHANGE. SYSTEM MODIFICATIONS WILL BE IDENTIFIED THAT WILL ENSURE PROPER PERFORMANCE. TESTING OF THE REFRIGERANTS WILL BE UNDERTAKEN TO VERIFY THAT THE DESIGN APPROACH WILL PRODUCE THE DESIRED END RESULTS.",

IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE OF THE CENTRAL ROLE OF IL-1 IN THE INFLAMMATORY PROCESS, IT IS PLANNED TO GENERATE TIL-SECRETING IL-1 BY TRANSDUCING TIL'S WITH A RETROVIRAL VECTOR CONTAINING IL-1 CDNA SEQUENCES. THE EFFECT OF IL-1 PRODUCTION BY TIL'S WILL BE STUDIED IN VITRO WITH HUMAN AND MOUSE TIL'S AND IN VIVO WITH MURINE MODELS TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS AUGMENTATION OF THE EFFICACYOF TUMOR KILLING.

PROPOSES TO DEVELOP AN INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEM (ITS) ARCHITECTURE THAT IS FLEXIBLE, MODULARLY STRUCTURED TO ALLOW FOR FUTURE EVOLUTION, AND WHICH CAN BE USED IN A FAMILY OF TACTICAL WEAPON SYSTEMS IN EMBEDDED TRAINING OPERATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, WE PROPOSE USING AN EXISTING ITS FOR WEAPON SYSTEM TRAINING, THE INTELLIGENT EMBEDDED OPERATOR ASSISTANT (IEOA), DEVELOPED IN PART BY GLOBAL FOR THE U.S. ARMY MISSILE COMMAND UNDER THE DIRECTION OF DR. WILLARD M. HOLMES, AS A BASELINE FOR CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH. THE IEOA WILL BE ENHANCED AND EXTENDED IN A NUMBER OF WAYS, INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF A NEW OPERATOR POSITION. STUDENT USERS CAN THEN BE EITHER OPERATOR TYPE (E.G., TACTICAL OR RADAR OPERATOR), AND THE ITS WILL MODEL THE MISSING TEAM MEMBER. THE MISSING TEAM MEMBER WILL BE MODELED EITHER AS AN EXPERT WHEN THE STUDENT IS A NOVICE, OR AS A NOVICE (USING ANOTHER STUDENT'S FAULTY OR INCOMPLETE STUDENT MODEL) WHEN THE STUDENT IS ADVANCED. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS - THE INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEM (ITS) DEVELOPED DURING PHASE I AND II WILL BE GENERIC AND WIDELY APPLICABLE TO HIGH PERFORMANCE, WEAPON SYSTEM SKILL-MAINTENANCE DOMAINS. THE ARCHITECTURE IS WELL SUITED TO AIR DEFENSE SYSTEMS, WHICH COULD BE UPDATED TO INCLUDE EMBEDDED TRAINING SYSTEMS OF THIS TYPE, AND NEW SYSTEMS COULD BE DESIGNED TO INTEGRATE SUCH AN ITS. THE ITS ARCHITECTURE IS GENERAL ENOUGH TO MODEL OTHER TYPES OF DOMAINS WHICH REQUIRE THE OPERATOR TO APPLY STRATEGIC RULES TO A DYNAMICALLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. SOME OF THE APPLICATIONS INCLUDE MANNED AND UNMANNED SPACE OPERATIONS TRAINING, REMOTE ROBOT MANIPULATION, AND AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL.",

TWO BASIC APPROACHES COULD BE USED TO ACCOMPLISH THE END OBJECTIVE. THE FIRST APPROACH WOULD BE TO FABRICATE THE LINER AS REQUESTED BY ISOSTATIC PROCESSING, MACHINE THE LINER, SHRINK FIT THE LINER INTO THE CONVENTIONAL BARREL, AND HEAT TREAT. THE SECOND APPROACH WOULD INVOLVE PROCESSING IN A PIGGY-BACK FASHION BARREL-LINER COMPOSITE SPECIMENS IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER. THIS APPROACH WOULD BE TO SIMULTANEOUSLY FABRICATE THE LINER AND BOND IT TOP THE BARREL TO AVOID MACHINING TO CLOSE TOLERANCES, INSERTION AND SHRINK FITTING OF THE LINER, AND POSSIBLY THE FINAL HEAT TREATMENT. THIS APPROACH PERMITS LOWER FABRICATION TEMPERATURES, GRAIN SIZE CONTROL AND PERMITS IMPROVED MICROSTRUCTURAL CONTROL.

THE TECHNIQUE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE A UNIQUE METHOD OF HIGH SPEED, HIGH RESOLUTION MINE DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION. THE PROPOSED METHOD USES A FOCUSED RECTANGULAR SYNTHETIC ARRAY AS A RECEIVER. THE SYNTHETIC ARRAY IS FORMED BY THE FORWARD MOTION OF A HORIZONTAL LINE ARRAY. THE FREQUENCY AND DIMENSIONS OF THE SYSTEM ARE CHOSEN FOR HIGH RESOLUTION, WHILE FORWARD SCATTERING AT THE BREWSTER ANGLE WILL REDUCE GROUND REFLECTIONS TO ZERO.

This proposal outlines a programs to develop such a material using wire mesh or knitted wire mesh sandwiched between two sheets of an electrically conducting copolymer which is elastomeric in nature. The proposed material will maintain its flexibility so that when flexed a number of times, it will not fracture or lose its initial effectiveness. It is also anticipated that the material will be rugged and durable. The proposed work relies on prior experience at Gumbs specifically in the use of conducting polymers for EMI shielding composites and encapsulants. During Phase I, prototypes will be fabricated and tested in efforts to demonstrate feasibility of the concept. Larger panels will be prepared furing Phase II to conduct full scale performance and evaluation tests.",

ALTHOUGH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST EXISTS IN 17 GHZ LINEAR COLLIDER CONCEPTS-AND SOME RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ARE ALREADY IN PROGRESS AT BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY AND MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (AND IN PRIVATE LABORATORIES INTERESTED IN COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF HIGH FREQUENCY LINACS)-THERE ARE NO RELATIVISTIC KLYSTRONS (RK) PRESENTLY AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT 17 GHZ HIGH GRADIENT ACCELERATOR RESEARCH. (LINEAR COLLIDER RK DEVELOPMENT IS AT 14 GHZ IN RUSSIA AND AT 11.4 GHZ IN THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN). THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO STUDY MEANS OF COMBINING RESEARCH ON HIGH POWER TRAVELING WAVE RELATIVISTIC KLYSTRON (TWRK) STRUCTURES; LONG RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) PULSE CIRCUIT DEVELOPMENT; AND THE AVAILABILITY OF AN EXISTING 580 KV, 120 A, 1 MUS PULSED-BEAM TEST FACILITY. REACHING THIS OBJECTIVE WILL ALLOW THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INEXPENSIVE PROGRAM FOR THE DESIGN, FABRICATION, AND TESTING OF A NEW RF SOURCE SUITABLE FOR HIGH GRADIENT 17 GHZ ACCELERATOR RESEARCH. PHASE I IS EXPLORING THE FEASIBILITY OF EXTENDING TO 17 GHZ NEW DESIGN CONCEPTS ASSOCIATED WITH A RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED 43% CONVERSION EFFICIENCY, 100 MW, 11.4 GHZ RK USING A NOVEL SLOW WAVE OUTPUT STRUCTURE. SPECIAL DESIGN EMPHASIS IS BEING DIRECTED AT ACHIEVING A GAIN OF 60 DB AND AN EFFICIENCY OF >48% WITH A PROTOTYPE 30 MW TUBE. IN PHASE II, THE 17 GHZ TWRK AND ITS HIGH POWER RF DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND INSTALLED IN THE TEST FACILITY, LONG PULSE HIGH POWER RF TESTS WILL BE PERFORMED, AND THE INTEGRITY AND SUITABILITY OF THE TUBE WILL BE EVALUATED. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THIS LOW PERVEANCE, HIGH EFFICIENCY TWRK COULD BE A STRONG CANDIDATE FOR A LINEAR COLLIDER PULSE COMPRESSION POWER SOURCE.",

IN PHASE I, EFFORTS ARE DIRECTED AT (1) ANALYTICALLY INVESTIGATING HIGH EFFICIENCY TECHNIQUES FOR RF MODULATING A RELATIVISTIC HIGH POWER BEAM DERIVED FROM A LINEAR INDUCTION ACCELERATOR (LIA); AND (2) ANALYTICALLY EVALUATING THE POSSIBILITY OF GENERATING 800 MW OF PHASE-STABLE RF POWER AT 11.4 GHZ, USING A NEW STYLE OF LOW IMPEDANCE TRAVELING WAVE (TW) STRUCTURE ESPECIALLY CONFIGURED TO PREVENT PULSE SHORTENING. SUCH AN RF POWER SOURCE, DESIGNED FOR OPERATION WITHIN A SMALL DIAMETER SOLENOID ASSEMBLY, COULD HAVE MULTIPLE OUTPUT ARMS ARRANGED FOR DIRECT CONNECTION TO THE CENTERLINE WAVEGUIDES OF A HIGH GRADIENT ACCELERATOR, THEREBY AVOIDING THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF A PULSE COMPRESSION SYSTEM. RF EXPERIMENTS USING LIA BEAMS (AT LLNL AND THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY) AND DIFFERENT DESIGN, 11.4 GHZ RELATIVISTIC KLYSTRONS FITTED WITH HIGH GROUP VELOCITY TW OUTPUT STRUCTURES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED OUTPUT POWER LEVELS OF 100 TO 300 MW. OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE SUGGESTS THAT THESE HIGH POWER TW DESIGN CONCEPTS COULD BE EXTENDED TO REALIZE POWER LEVELS GREATER THAN 500 MW PER STRUCTURE, BUT THE SERIES OPERATION OF TWO OR MORE SUCH STRUCTURES WOULD RISK ENCOUNTERING SEVERE PULSE SHORTENING FROM A COMBINATION OF REGENERATIVE AND CUMULATIVE BEAM BREAKUP. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, HEAVY DAMPING OF THE HIGHER ORDER MODES (HOM) WOULD BE INSUFFICIENT TO PREVENT PULSE SHORTENING; THE INVESTIGATION OF A FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE TECHNIQUE FOR HOM SUPPRESSION IS PLANNED DURING PHASE I. IN PHASE II, A PROTOTYPE VERSION OF THIS HIGH EFFICIENCY, 800 MW, 11.4 GHZ RF GENERATOR WILL BE ENGINEERED, FABRICATED, AND PREPARED FOR INSTALLATION IN AN LLNL LIA TEST FACILITY FOR EVALUATION OF HIGH POWER PERFORMANCE.",

THE FOCUS OF THIS STUDY IS THE DEFINITION OF INJURIES OBSERVED IN YOUNG CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS WHILE RESTRAINED BY CHILD RESTRAINT SYSTEMS. A SIX MONTH RETROSPECTIVE STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO CORRELATE INJURIES OF CHILD ACCIDENT VICTIMS, THE CHILD RESTRAINT DEVICE, THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INJURED CHILD, AND THE RESPECTIVE ACCIDENT PARTICULARS FROM ACCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED BETWEEN 1985 AND 1991 IN 13 WESTERN NEW YORK COUNTIES. THIS STUDY INCLUDED DATA FROM: THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES, ACCIDENT REPORTS FROM THE INVOLVED POLICE JURISDICTIONS, EMERGENCY MEDICAL PERSONNEL LOGS, HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM LOGS, HOSPITAL ADMISSION AND DISCHARGE REPORTS, AND FINALLY, INTERVIEWS WITH THE PARENTS OR GUARDIANS OF THE CHILDREN. THE RETROSPECTIVE STUDY WAS SUPPLEMENTED WITH IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATIONS OF RELEVANT ACCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE PHASE I TIME FRAME. THE RESULTS WILL LEAD TO INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF CHILD IMPACT INJURY MECHANISMS, BETTER DEFINITION OF CHILD IMPACT TOLERANCE LEVELS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE EFFECTIVE CHILD RESTRAINT SYSTEMS, CHILD SIZE TEST DUMMIES POSSESSING HIGHER LEVELS OF BIOFIDELITY, AND MORE REALISTIC PERFORMANCE EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR CHILD PROTECTION DEVICES.",

AUTOMATED COLONY COUNTING WOULD FACILITATE FASTER AND LESS EXPENSIVE MYELOTOXICITY EVALUATIONS, KEEPING PACE WITH MODERN EFFICACY SCREENS (I.E., IN VITRO CANCER CELL LINE PANELS), SO THAT NEW ANTI-CANCER AND ANTI-HIV AGENTS WITH FAVORABLE THERAPEUTIC INDICES, RATHER THAN EFFICACIES, WOULD BE SELECTED FOR DEVELOPMENT. IN PHASE I, WE WILL DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF ADAPTING CAP SCAN TM TECHNOLOGIES TO AUTOMATED QUANTITATION OF COLONIES OF HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC PROGENITORS (CFU-GM AND BFU-E). IN PHASE II, WE WILL DEVELOP THE REQUIRED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE ADAPTATIONS INDICATED BY THE PHASE I RESEARCH, AND EXTEND THE AUTOMATION TO MURINE HEMATOPOIETIC COLONIES AND TO HEMATOPOIETIC COLONIES THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL STAINS FOR DETECTION (CFU-MEG). IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS WOULD MARK THE FIRST TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED FOR AUTOMATED COUNTING OF HEMATOPOIETIC COLONIES. WITH OVER 10,000 COMPOUNDS SCREENED EACH YEAR IN ANTI-CANCER DRUG DISCOVERY PROGRAMS, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMERCIAL APPLICATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         IN COAL-FIRED OPEN-CYCLE MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC (MHD) POWERPLANTS, A KEY ISSUE IS CHLORIDE BUILDUP. A FURTHER CONSIDERATION IS THAT UNDER THE 1990 CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENTS, EMISSION OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCI) GAS/AEROSOL FROM A CONTINUOUS SOURCE MUST BE BROUGHT BELOW 10 TONS/YEAR. POTASSIUM ADDED IN THE MHD SYSTEM UPSTREAM, TO CREATE PLASMA CONDUCTIVITY AND ACHIEVE SULFUR DIOXIDE REMOVAL, CAN ALSO CONTROL HCI EMISSION IF ADDED IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES. HOWEVER, THE RESULTING CHLORIDES FROM THE SPENT SEED MATERIALS MUST BE REMOVED OR THEIR CONCENTRATIONS MUST BE REDUCED TO CONTROL THEIR BUILDUP IN THE RECYCLED SEED. TO DECHLORINATE THE SPENT SEED MATERIAL WITHOUT LOSING A SIGNIFICANT QUANTITY OF POTASSIUM, THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE SPACE INSTITUTE (UTSI) HAS DEVELOPED AN ION-EXCHANGE RESIN-BASED CONCEPT. THIS CONCEPT IS SIMPLE, USES MILD OPERATING CONDITIONS, IS BASED ON EXISTING TECHNOLOGY OF WATER SOFTENING, AND OFFERS A POTENTIALLY ATTRACTIVE OPTION TO SIMULTANEOUSLY CARRY OUT DECHLORINATION AND DESULFURIZATION OF THE MHD SPENT SEED AT AN OVERALL COST SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE OPTION CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED. IN COOPERATION WITH UTSI, COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CANDIDATE RESINS ARE BEING SCREENED IN PHASE I TO SELECT ONE OR TWO FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN THE PHASE II PERIOD. THE NECESSARY PROCESS FLOW SHEETS ARE ALSO BEING DEVELOPED TO INTEGRATE SEED RECOVERY/REGENERATION OPERATIONS WITH THE PROPOSED DECHLORINATION SYSTEM FOR INTEGRATED MHD PLANT. IN PHASE II OF THE PROJECT, AN INTEGRATED DEMONSTRATION WILL BE UNDERTAKEN USING UTSI FACILITIES; THE RESULTING DECHLORINATED AND DESULFURIZED MATERIALS WOULD BE RECYCLED TO AN MHD COMBUSTOR.",

IN THIS PROJECT, HNC WILL APPLY ITS NEW MULTIFUSION APPROACH TO MULTIPLE SENSOR FUSION AND A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE EXPLOITATION TO THE PROBLEM OF MOBILE TARGET DETECTION. THE MULTIFUSION APPROACH UTILIZES NEURAL NETWORKS TO CARRY OUT PRE-CLASSIFICATION FEATURE EXTRACTION AND ATTRIBUTE DERIVATION FOR EACH TYPE OF SENSOR PRODUCT EMPLOYED. A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE TARGETS AND THE RULES FOR THEIR USE IS PRE-CODED INTO A BELIEF COMBINATION NETWORK. AFTER EXTRACTING THE FEATURES AND ATTRIBUTES FROM EACH OF THE SENSOR OUTPUT IS COMPLETED, THEY ARE ENTERED INTO THE BELIEF COMBINATION NETWORK TO CARRY OUT FUSION. THE OUTPUT OF THE BELIEF COMBINATION NETWORK IS A DETERMINATION OF THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE OBJECT BEING CONSIDERED IS A MOBILE TARGET. HNC'S MULTIFUSION APPROACH IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT COMBINES CLASSICAL NEURAL NETWORK PATTERN CLASSIFICATION METHODS WITH RULE-BASED METHODS IN A SINGLE UNIFIED STRUCTURE. ANOTHER ADVANTAGE OF THE MULTIFUSION APPROACH IS THAT IT IS COMPUATIONALLY EFFICIENT AND WILL SUPPORT ON-BOARD REAL TIME PROCESSING IN BOTH MISSILES AND AIRCRAFT.

This project is developing a system to compress data such as imagery and speech into data neutronium. This project is developing a system to compress data such as imagery and speech into data neutronium. We are using two new results: a theory relating the tolerable level of reconstruction error to the maximum possible level of compression, as the Cottrell/Munro/Zipser neural network technique (which is capable of achieving maximum compression). Unlike fractal compression (the only other known method theoretically capable of approaching data neutronium density levels), which is computationally impractical, the C/M/Z neural network (which is trained off-line once) is computationally simple, and can carry out both data compression and decompression in real-time using low-cost hardware. Our goal is to achieve compression ratios from 100:1 to 1000:1 for speech and imagery with broadcast quality reconstruction.",

WHEREAS THIS IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE MEANS OF OXYGEN CONTROL FOR BLOOD BANK PRACTICE, THE CURRENT PROPOSAL WILL EXPLORE METHODS OF MORE SIMPLY REDUCING LEVELS OF SOLUBLE O2 IN THE PLATELET CONCENTRATE AND WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE PSORALEN DERIVATIVES OTHER THAN 8-MOP WHICH REQUIRE LOWER CONCENTRATION AND ARE MORE EFFICIENT INTERCALATORS OF DNA WITH A CONSEQUENT REDUCTION OF FREE RADICAL INFORMATION.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         WE ASSERT THAT THE PRINCIPAL INHIBITOR OF TAQ POLYMERASE IN BLOOD SAMPLES IS HEME. THE GOAL IS TO DEVELOP CHEMICAL, PHOTOCHEMICAL, ENZYMATIC, OR AFFINITY BINDING METHODS FOR THE INACTIVATION OF HEME WITH A LONG TERM OBJECTIVE OF ALLOWING POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR) TO BECOME A ROUTINE CLINICAL DIAGNOSTIC TOOL WITH MINIMAL HANDLING OF THE SAMPLES TO BE AMPLIFIED: FOR EXAMPLE, WHOLE BLOOD SAMPLES WITHOUT PURIFICATION OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS OR DRY BLOOD SMEARS WHICH HAVE EXISTED FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. THE METHODS TO BE ASSAYED ARE THE INACTIVATION OF HEME BY DIRECT CHEMICAL OR PHOTOCHEMICAL PROCEDURES, THE INACTIVATION OF HEME BY ENZYMATIC PROCEDURES AND THE REMOVAL OF HEME BY AFFINITY BINDING PROCEDURES. HEME IS REPORTED TO TOTALLY INHIBIT PCR AT A CONCENTRATION OF O.8 MICROMOLAR. IT BECOMES A MAJOR PROBLEM IN SITUATIONS WITH LOW COPY NUMBER OF PATHOGENS SINCE LARGE VOLUMES OF BLOOD ARE REQUIRED FOR SAMPLE PREPARATION AND HEMOLYSIS MUST BE AVOIDED IN THE PROCEDURE. ATTEMPTS TO OVERCOME THIS INHIBITORY EFFECT HAVE BEEN BY ADDING MORE TEMPLATE OR BY THE ADDITION OF GLOBIN TO BIND THE HEME OR IN OTHER STUDIES BY THE ADDITIONAL QUANTITIES OF TAQ POLYMERASE OR PRIMER. WE HOWEVER, WILL PURSUE THE INACTIVATION OR REMOVAL OF THE HEME. IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF PROCEDURES TO BE CARRIED OUT, THE MAJOR CONVERSION PRODUCTS WHERE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE, WILL BE OBTAINED AND ASSAYED FOR THEIR EFFECT ON THE MODEL PCR SYSTEM. FOR CHEMICAL INACTIVATION, REDUCTIVE AND OXIDATIVE PROCEDURES WILL BE ASSAYED WORKING ON THE PORPHYRIN RING OR ALTERATION OF THE IRON ATOM THROUGH VALANCE CHANGE, REMOVAL OR SUBSTITUTION. PHOTOCHEMICAL CHANGES INDUCED BY IRRADIATION OF WHOLE OR PARTIALLY PROCESSED BLOOD ARE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE OXIDATION PRODUCTS OF HEME AND IT WILL BE DETERMINED IF THESE OXIDATION PRODUCTS OF THEMSELVES ARE INHIBITORY. SINCE HEME IS NATURALLY DEGRADED TO BILIVERDIN AND BILIRUBIN, IF THESE HAVE INHIBITORY EFFECTS EXPOSURE TO VISIBLE LIGHT NOT ONLY ALTERS THE BINDING OF BILIRUBIN TO ALBUMIN BUT INDUCES PHOTO DEGRADATION. AGAIN, THESE PHOTO PRODUCTS WILL BE EXAMINED FOR INHIBITORY EFFECTS. IN ADDITION, THE EFFECTS OF THESE PROCEDURES ON THE NUCLEIC ACIDS WILL BE EXAMINED. THE ENZYMATIC INACTIVATION OF HEME WILL BE FOLLOWED BY EMPLOYING HEME OXYGENASE AND AGAIN THE REACTION PRODUCTS BILIRUBIN AND BILIVERDIN, WILL BE ASSESSED IN THIS REACTION. FINALLY, THE REMOVAL OF HEME BY AFFINITY BINDING METHODS WILL BE UNDERTAKEN. HERE APPARENTLY THE ATTEMPT WILL BE MADE TO FILL THE AXIAL LIGANDS OF IRON TO PREVENT BINDING BETWEEN HEME AND THE TAQ POLYMERASE AND ALSO AN ATTEMPT WILL BE MADE TO BIND THE IRON WITH TRANSFERRIN (A REACTION 0 KNOWN NOT TO OCCUR) GLOBIN OR MYOGLOBIN (REALLY APOMYOGLOBIN). DEFEROXAMINE WILL ALSO BE ATTEMPTED, HOWEVER, THIS IS ANOTHER AGENT KNOWN NOT TO BIND TO HEME IRON OR TO REMOVE IRON FROM HEME. ALL THESE ATTEMPTS WILL BE ASSAYED IN A MODEL SYSTEM USING STANDARD HLA-DQALPHA PCR REACTION.",

THE AD CS WILL MAINTAIN A UNIQUE BANDWIDTH-TO-ACCURACY TRADE-OFF RATIO OF 1.5 EFFECTIVE BITS PER FACTOR OF 2 BANDWIDTH (BW) REDUCTION (INSTEAD OF THE USUAL 1 BIT). THIS IMPROVEMENT IS DUE TO AN ULTRAFAST DECIMATION FILTER USING RECENTLY DEVELOPED RAPID SINGLE FLUX QUANTUM (RSFQ) LOGIC/MEMOIY ELEMENTS CAPABLE OF IOOGHZ OPERATION. THE PROGRANGOAL IS TO REPLACE THE SIMPLE 2-BIT QUANTIZER FRONT END OF THE ADC WITH A MULTI-BIT SOUID WHEEL DESIGN, YIELDING 3 EXTRA BITS OF RESOLUTION FOR THE SANE BANDWIDTH. THE PROPOSED ADCS ARE EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE 16.5 EFFECTIVE BITS AT SOMHZ BW OR 1.5 EFFECTIVE BITS AT SOGHZ BW. THESE ADCS HAVE BOTH SMALL AREA AND LOW-POWER DISSIPATION, THEREFORE MANY CHANNELS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED ON A SINGLE SUBSTRATE. MULTIPLE CHANNELS CAN BE SYNCHRONIZED BY A SINGLE IOOGHZ CLOCK.

THIS FIELD IS SO WEAK THAT AN ULTRASENSITIVE MAGNETIC SENSOR IS NEEDED TO ALLOW SPECIFIC BIOMAGNETIC MEASUREMENTS. SUPERCONDUCTING QUANTUM INTERFERENCE DEVICES (SQUIDS) ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE DETECTORS OF MAGNETIC FLUX AND HAVE BEEN USED EXTENSIVELY TO DETECT THE HUMAN MAGNETOCARDIOGRAM AND MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAM AND OTHER BIOMAGNETIC SIGNALS. TO UTILIZE A SQUID AS A MAGNETOMETER, THE SQUID'S TRANSFER CHARACTERISTICS SHOULD BE LINEARIZED. THIS LINEARIZATION REQUIRES EXTENSIVE PERIPHERAL ELECTRONICS, THUS LIMITING THE NUMBER OF SQUID MAGNETOMETER CHANNELS IN A PRACTICAL SYSTEM. THE PROJECTED DIGITAL SQUID WOULD INTEGRATE THE PROCESSING CIRCUITRY ON THE SAME CRYOGENIC CHIP AS THE SQUID MAGNETOMETER AND ELIMINATE THE SOPHISTICATED PERIPHERAL ELECTRONICS. SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD BE COMPACT, COST EFFECTIVE, AND REQUIRE MINIMAL SUPPORT ELECTRONICS. THIS PROJECT WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIN-FILM DIGITAL MAGNETOMETER/GRADIOMETER CHIPS. IN ADDITION TO HAVING ON-CHIP PROCESSING CIRCUITRY COUPLED TO A SQUID, EACH CHIP WILL ALSO HAVE AN INTEGRATED SUPERCONDUCTING TRANSFORMER TO FACILITATE ITS INTERFACE TO AN EXTERNAL PICK-UP COIL.

The VEUTel system will correct the problems associated with low band- width feedback by totally immersing the operator in a virtual reality simulation of the remote telerobotic environment. The VEUTeI system will intercept operator commands and provide instantaneous graphical simulation of the effect of the command on the telerobot, while relaying the commands to the remote telerobot. The system will insure the integrity of the simulation by using visual and/or range updates from the remote environment to correct the simulated environment, if discrepancies between the simulated and remote environment occur.",

EXISTING MAGNETS WITH THE HIGHEST PEAK FIELDS USE A15 COMPOUND SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIALS, MOST COMMONLY NIOBIUM-TIN (NB3SN). THE PRIMARY REASON FOR NB3SN SUCCESS IS THAT THIS COMPOUND CAN BE FORMED THROUGH INTERNAL TIN OR BRONZE PROCESSES, WHICH ALLOW A15 PHASE FORMATION AT RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURES (<800 DEGREES CENTIGRADE). HOWEVER, NIOBIUM-ALUMINUM (NB3AL) HAS THE ADVANTAGES OF SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER CRITICAL MAGNETIC FIELD (HC2) AND CONSIDERABLY GREATER STRAIN TOLERANCE THAN NB3SN. PREVIOUS WORK ON NB3AL HAS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL FOR GOOD CURRENT DENSITY AT HIGH FIELD, BUT LIMITATIONS IN LARGE SCALE PRODUCTION METHODS HAVE PREVENTED THE MATERIAL FROM ACHIEVING THIS POTENTIAL. WORK TO DATE PROVIDES AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT FINER SUBDIVISION OF NB AND AL COMPONENTS IN A COMPOSITE IMPROVES PROPERTIES, WITH CRITICAL TEMPERATURE (TC), HC2, AND HIGH FIELD CRITICAL CURRENT (JC) ALL INCREASING IN INVERSE PROPORTION TO COMPONENT THICKNESS. ONE POSSIBLE METHOD FOR DECREASING COMPONENT THICKNESS WITHOUT VERY HIGH AREA REDUCTIONS--MECHANICAL ALLOYING--WILL BE STUDIED IN THIS PROJECT. THE PHASE I RESEARCH INCLUDES STUDY OF THE MECHANICAL ALLOYING OF NB AND AL TO FORM PRECURSOR RODS THAT HAVE A HIGHLY REFINED DIVISION OF COMPONENTS. THESE RODS ARE ENCASED IN COPPER AND THEN CONVENTIONALLY EXTRUDED AND DRAWN TO WIRE, A TECHNIQUE THAT ALLOWS EVALUATION OF THIS METHOD AS A COMMERCIAL PROCESS FOR FABRICATING LONG LENGTHS OF CONDUCTOR. VARIOUS REACTION HEAT TREATMENTS ARE BEING EXPLORED. TRANSPORT CRITICAL CURRENT DENSITY IS BEING MEASURED AS A FUNCTION OF MAGNETIC FIELD. MICROSTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS IS BEING CONDUCTED IN ORDER TO QUANTIFY THE COMPONENT THICKNESSES AND MORPHOLOGY, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER HEAT TREATMENT.

THE INCREASED DENSITY AND DECREASED SIZE IN SOLDER JOINTS, PER SE, DRAW CONCERNS ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF SUCH SOLDER JOINTS WHICH ARE MADE OF CONVENTIONAL SOLDER MATERIALS. FURTHERMORE, IT HAS ALSO BEEN A CONCERN IN THE NANUFACTURING SECTOR THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COST IN PRODUCING MICROELECTRONIC ASSEMBLIES IS CONTRIBUTED BY THE INSPECTION AND REWORK OF SOLDER JOINTS. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO FURTHER ADVANCE THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF SOLDERS BY UTILIZING THE FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES; TO EXPLORE AND ESTABLISH TECHNOLOGY FOR STRENGTHENING SOLDER MATERIALS; TO DEVISE USEFUL PRODUCTS WHICH OFFER SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE TO CONVENTIONAL SOLDERS, AND, CONCURRENTLY, TO EXPLORE THE SCIENTIFIC AND MANUFACTURING FEASIBILITY IN REDUCTION OF LEAD (PB) USAGE IN SOLDER MATERIALS. THE EFFORT OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON THE INTEGRATION OF VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES IN METALLURGY, CHEMISTRY, PHYSICS, AND ANALYTICAL CHARACTERIZATION TO CREATE A NEW GENERATION OF SOLDER MATERIALS WHICH OFFER SUPERIOR CHARACTERISTICS IN PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION TO THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF BASIC MATERIAL SYSTEMS, THE PROCESS FOR FABRICATING SUCH MATERIALS IS A KEY STEP FOR THE OVERALL SUCCESS OF THE PROJECT.

Interoperability of applications requires a common module interconnection framework (MIF). Phase I will extend the design and development of an existing MIF, called Catalyst. Catalyst emphasizes enabling large scale, organization-wide information systems. The MIF will include facilities for application integration, reliable data management, and collaborative workflow automation and management. The key components of Catalyst are: 1. I-Gates enable the integration of in-place vendor and proprietary in-house applications into a MIF. 2. An I-Bridge enables applications that support one MIF standard to interoperate with applications that support another MIF standard. However, an I-Bridge can be developed for approximately the same cost as integrating two different applications. Intergrating frameworks instead of individual applications realizes a significant reduction in system lifecycle costs. 3. FrameScript workflow specifications assist different workgroups in automating complex series of control and data flow transactions between different applications. This key innovation enables the management of domain-specific methodologies with explicit workflow scripts that can be developed, shared, and evolved.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ALCOHOL USAGE OVER TIME RESULTS IN A NUMBER OF METABOLIC ALTERATIONS TO SEVERAL ORGAN SYSTEMS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN LIVER FUNCTION. ONE OF THE LATTER CHANGES IS THE PRODUCTION AND SECRETION INTO THE BLOOD OF AN ISOFORM OF THETRANSFERRIN MOLECULE. THE PI 5.7-TRANSFERRIN ISOFORM CAN BEDETECTED BY ISOELECTRIC FOCUSING, AND ITS QUANTITIES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO DIRECTLY CORRELATE WITH THE AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL INTAKE BY AN INDIVIDUAL OVER A TIME PERIOD RELATED TO THE TURNOVER RATE OF TRANSFERRIN IN BLOOD. THE PI 5.7-TRANSFERRIN ISOFORM DIMINISHES BACK TO NORMAL LEVELS AFTER ALCOHOL INTAKE IS STOPPED. THE LITERATURE SHOWS THAT QUANTITATION OF THE 5.7-TRANSFERRIN ISOFORM IS CLINICALLY USEFUL FOR INITIAL ESTIMATION OF ALCOHOL USAGE AND FOR MONITORING INDIVIDUALS UNDER TREATMENT FOR ALCOHOLISM DISEASE. PRESENT TESTS FOR THE 5.7-TRANSFERRIN ARE TIME CONSUMING, REQUIRE A TECHNICAL EXPERTISE USUALLY NOT AVAILABLE IN CLINICAL LABORATORIES, AND ARE EXPENSIVE TO PERFORM. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DELINEATE THE MOLECULAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NATIVE (PI 5.4) AND THE PI 5.7-TRANSFERRIN ISOFORM. BASED UPON THE MOLECULAR DIFFERENCE, AN IMMUNOASSAY WILL BE CONSTRUCTED THAT CAN BE USED DIRECTLY ON SERUM OR PLASMA SPECIMENS TO QUANTITATE THE PI 5.7-TRANSFERRIN FORM. THE ASSAY WILL BE SIMILIAR TO OTHER IMMUNOASSAY TESTS FOR BLOOD PROTEINS AND WILL BE COST EFFECTIVE, AND THUS IT SHOULD FIND WIDE USAGE IN THE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF ALCOHOLISM.",

HOWEVER, MANY EXISTING AND POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS REQUIRE TAPERS UP TO 200MM. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN MEDICAL IMAGING AND X-RAY AREA DETECTORS BASED ON CCD IMAGERS, WHERELARGER AND HIGHER RESOLUTION IMAGES ARE REQUIRED BUT PROGRESS HAS BEEN RESTRICTED DUE TO THE RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE OF THE CCD CHIPS AND NON AVAILABILITY OF LARGE TAPERS.

UNLIKE THE DENSE, GRANULAR CERAMIC FILTER ELEMENTS, VACUUM-FORMED CHOPPED CERAMIC FIBER (VFCCF) FILTERS REPRESENT AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE.

THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO IMPROVE THE CYTOTOXIC POTENCY OF IMMUNOTOXINS BY USING A MORE POTENT TOXIN THAN IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO DETERMINE OPTIMAL CONDITIONS AND CROSSLINKING REAGENTS FOR THE MODIFICATION AND CONJUGATION OF THE MUTANT EXOTOXIN TO ANTIBODY, AND TO COMPARE DIRECTLY THE SPECIFIC AND NON-SPECIFIC CYTOTOXICITY OF THESE CONJUGATES TO CONJUGATES PREPARED WITH RICIN A CHAIN. IMMUNOTOXINS PREPARED EITHER BY DISULFIDE OR THIOETHER LINKAGE BETWEEN ANTIBODY AND THE MUTANT EXOTOXIN WILL BE PREPARED AND TESTED FOR CYTOTOXICITY TO ESTABLISH OPTIMAL CONJUGATION PARAMETERS. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, IMMUNOTOXINS WILL BE PREPARED WITH THE MUTANT ETA AND SEVERAL MABS. THE SPECIFIC AND NON-SPECIFIC TOXICITY OF THESE IMMUNOTOXINS AND RICIN A CHAIN IMMUNOTOXINS PREPARED WITH THE SAME ANTIBODIES WILL BE DIRECTLY COMPARED BY TESTING ON IN VITRO TARGET CELL LINES.

SUCH A SOURCE SHOULD AID THE ACCEPTANCE OF PHOTOREFRACTIVE KERATECTOMY AS A USEFUL PROCEDURE. THE LASER SOURCE WILL BE DESIGNED TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT ENERGY FOR CORNEAL ABLATION, WITH A SMOOTH INTENSITY PROFILE ACROSS THE BEAM CROSS SECTION, AND WITH SMALL VARIATIONS IN PULSE TO PULSE ENERGY CONTENT. THE LASER LIGHT WILL BE OBTAINED BY AN EFFICIENT THREE STAGE MIXING PROCESS IN NONLINEAR CRYSTALS THAT CONVERTS THE 1064 NM OUTPUT OF A ND:YAG LASER TO 213 NM. INTERACTION OF THE LIGHT SOURCE WITH CORNEAL TISSUE WILL BE EVALUATED IN TERMS OF ABLATION THRESHOLD, ABLATION RATE, AND SURFACE ROUGHNESS AS DETER- MINED BY TEM ANALYSIS. THESE PARAMETERS ARE REQUIRED FOR THE DESIGN OF A COMMERCIAL CORNEAL SCULPTING MACHINE THAT OPERATES AT 213 NM.",

THE MANUFACTURE OF ASPHERIC MIRRORS WITH THE REQUIRED HIGH PERFECTION IS BOTH COSTLY AND DIFFICULT WITH CURRENTLY AVAILABLE MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES. ION BEAM POLISHING HAS RECENTLY BEEN SHOWN TO BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING HIGH QUALITY SURFACES, ON MATERIAL LIKE FUSED SILICA AND ZERODUR, BUT THERE IS INADEQUATE INFORMATION ON WHAT OTHER MATERIALS CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY POLISHED WITH ION BEAMS. WE PROPOSE TO STUDY THE ION BEAM POLISHING OF A SELECTED GROUP OF MATERIALS THAT HAVE HIGH POTENTIAL FOR USE AS X-RAY MIRRORS. THIS GROUP CONSISTS OF MOLYBDENUM, SILICON AND SILICON CARBIDE IN THE FORM OF SINGLE CRYSTALS, POLYCRYSTALLINE SOLIDS AND CVD DEPOSITED FILMS. FOR EACH MATERIAL WE PROPOSE TO ESTABLISH WHICH MATERIALS CAN BE ION BEAM POLISHED TO THE REQUISITE FIGURE AND SURFACE ROUGHNESS AND ALSO TO DETERMINE A MEASURE OF THE INITIAL SURFACE ROUGHNESS THAT IS REQUIRED FOR ION BEAM POLISHING TO ACHIEVE AN ACCEPTABLE FINAL SURFACE. THE SURFACE FLATNESS, SURFACE ROUGHNESS AND SUBSURFACE DAMAGE AND OF ALL SAMPLES WILL BE MEASURED.",

A PILOT CASE STUDY INDICATED THE SUCCESS OF A PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE FOR A BRAIN INJURED INDIVIDUAL WHEN THE INTERFACE AND FEATURES OF THE SOFTWARE WERE ADAPTED TO THE INDIVIDUAL'S COGNITIVE DEFICITS AND RESIDUAL RESOURCES. TRAINING TIME FOR THE SURVIVOR WAS ACCOMPLSHED IN THREE 30-MINUTE TRAINING SESSIONS PER MAJOR MODULE. THE CUSTOMIZED INTERFACE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR IMMEDIATE AND LONG-TERM RESULTS. RESEARCH WITH TWO ADDITIONAL SUBJECTS IS STILL IN PROGRESS, BUT RESULTS THUS FAR SUPPORT THE PILOT STUDY FINDINGS. THE HIGH FUNCTIONING LEVEL OF THE ADDITIONAL SUBJECTS SUGGESTS THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL APPROACH MAY WELL BE APPROPRIATE FOR TBI SURVIVORS WHO ARE INDEPENDENT YET IMPAIRED. WE WILL PERFORM RESEARCH ON A TO DO LIST COGNITIVE PROSTHESIS WHICH WOULD BE CUSTOMIZED TO THE NEEDS OF TBI INDIVIDUALS. OUR APPROACH IS UNIQUE BECAUSE IT RELIES ON A SELF-SUFFICIENCY MODEL COMBINING THEORETICAL BASIS FROM COMPUTER HUMAN INTERACTION, OFFICE INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND REHABILITATION AREAS TO IMPROVE THE FUNCTIONING OF TBI SURVIVORS. THIS RESEARCH FOCUSES STRONGLY ON PERFORMANCE MEASURES OBTAINED BY SYSTEM MONITOR LOGS OF THE USE OF THE PROSTHESIS, PERSONAL REPORTS, VIDEO DATA, AND NEUROPHSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS. THE RESULTS OF OUR RESEARCH WILL ORIGINATE DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS FOR NEW INTERFACE GUIDELINE AND ESSENTIAL PARAMETERS FOR DEVELOPING ADAPTABLE PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY TOOLS.",

THIS METHOD REQUIRES REPETITIVE PULSED POWER SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT OR EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE, INEFFICIENT, AND CARRY ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS. A ROBUST, ECONOMIC, EFFICIENT PULSED POWER METHOD IS PLANNED. THIS RESEARCH IS DEVELOPING NOVEL PULSE MODULATOR CONCEPTS WITH HIGHER EFFICIENCY AND MORE RELIABLE CONSTRUCTION THAN CURRENT METHODS. THE APPROACH IS BASED ON AN INNOVATION IN REPETITIVE SWITCHING, THE SUPER-EMISSIVE CATHODE SWITCH (SEC). THE SEC SWITCH HAS SEVERAL VERSIONS, INCLUDING THE PSEUDOSPARK AND THE BACK-LIGHTED THRATRON (BLT). IT HAS DEMONSTRATED HIGH VOLTAGE, HIGH REPETITION RATE, AND LONG LIFETIME CHARACTERISTICS OF THYRATRON SWITCHES, WHILE OPERATING WITH HIGHER CURRENTS, LOWER INDUCTANCE, AND SIMPLER STRUCTURES THAT ARE ROBUST AND MORE SUITABLE FOR HIGH VOLTAGE OPERATION (WHICH IS REQUIRED BY THESE SYSTEMS).

THE BASIC APPROACH TO (1) INVOLVES DIRECTLY DESIGNING A GOOD CLOSED-LOOP RESPONSE, AS OPPOSED TO DESIGNING AN OPEN-LOOP CONTROLLER THAT YIELDS A GOOD CLOSED-LOOP RESPONSE. A WIDE VARIETY OF IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS ON SYSTEM PERFORMANCE CAN BE FORMULATED AS CONVEX CONSTRAINTS ON THE RESPONSE OF THE CLOSED-LOOP SYSTEM, E.G., PEAK RMS, STEP RESPONSE BOUNDS, FREQUENCY DOMAIN (SINGULAR VALUE) BOUNDS, SETTLING TIME, AND PERCENT OVERSHOOT. THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS APPROACH WILL NOT BE REALIZED UNLESS THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE DESIGNER AND THE CONTROLLER ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS PROGRAM (2) IS CONVENIENT AND NATURAL. WE PROPOSE THAT THE INTERFACE SHOULD BE ENTIRELY GRAPHICAL: THE DESIGNER WILL SELECT AND DRAG THE SPECIFICATIONS (E.G., FREQUENCY RESPONSE OR STEP RESPONSE BOUNDS); THE CONTROLLER DESIGN CODE WILL COMPUTE A CONTROLLER THAT SATISFIES THE SPECIFICATIONS (OR RELAX THE SPECIFICATIONS IF THEY ARE INFEASIBLE). ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS - THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO PROCESS CONTROL DESIGN WILL HAVE POTENTIAL USE AT MANY GOVERNMENT MATERIAL PROCESSING LABS. THE POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION IS BOTH IN AIDING PROCESS ENGINEERS WITH CONTROLLER DESIGN AS WELL AS DEVELOPING A NEW CACE TOOL MARKET IN THE PROCESS CONTROL INDUSTRY.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         AN AUTONOMOUS AIRFIELD REPAIR VEHICLE (ARV) WILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH AN AREA TO PERFORM REPAIR OPERATIONS ON RUNWAYS AND TAXIWAYS. IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY USE, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ONLY THE ONBOARD SENSORS AND MEMORY RESIDENT TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP BE USED FOR THIS NAVIGATION. INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION, INC., HAS DEVELOPED THE CONCEPT FOR A THREE DIMENSIONAL CAMERA WHICH WILL GIVE A FULL RANGE MAP OF THE SCENE AS SEEN BY THE CAMERA AT A RATE OF 60 FRAMES PER SECOND. OUR INITIAL EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN AN ACCURACY OF LESS THAN 1 INCH OVER A RANGE OF 100 FEET FROM THE CAMERA, WHICH IS FAR BETTER THAN THE 1/2 FOOT REQUIREMENT OF THE ARV. THE FULL, ACCURATE RANGE IMAGE PRODUCED AT 60 FRAMES PER SECOND MAKE THE PROBLEM OF NAVIGATING BASED ON A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP A TRIVIAL APPLICATION OF IMAGE MATCHING ALGORITHMS. USING VERY CONVENTIONAL TRANSFORMATION MATRICES, THE TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP CAN BE TRANSFORMED TO A RANGE MAP OF DISTANCES FROM THE LAST KNOWN POSITION OF THE CAMERA. THIS IS THEN COMPARED TO THE RANGE IMAGE PRODUCED BY THE CAMERA, AND THE DIFFERENCES USED TO COMPUTE THE NEW POSITION OF THE CAMERA. THE PROCESS IS ITERATIVE, AND WILL CONVERGE VERY RAPIDLY. WE ESTIMATE THE TIME TO COMPUTE THE CAMERA'S POSITION TO BE NO MORE THAN 1/15 SECOND. THE KEY IS THAT THE IMAGE WE ARE CAPTURING WITH OUR CAMERA IS NOT A CONVENTIONAL INTENSITY IMAGE, BUT A FULL, ACCURATE RANGE MAP GIVING THE RANGE TO EVERY POINT IN THE SCENE. THE INFORMATION IN THE RANGE IMAGE IS THE SAME TYPE OF INFORMATION AS IS IN THE TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP, HENCE THE PROBLEM REDUCES TO ONE OF SIMPLE PATTERN MATCHING.",

OUR PROPOSED INS COMPONENT USES NOVEL SILICON MICROSENSORS WITH ON-CHIP FUNCTIONALITY (SMART MICROSENSORS) SUCH AS A MICRO-RESONATING GYROSCOPE (MRG). THE SENSORS' OUTPUT ARE INTERFACED TO A MICROPROCESSOR WHERE KALMAN FILTERING AND COMPUTATIONS ARE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE POSITION AND VELOCITY AS A FUNCTION OF TIME. THE OBJECTIVES OF PHASE I ARE: (1) TO CHARACTERIZE THE CONSTITUENTS OF SNS INCLUDING SENSORS, GPS, AND INTERFACE ELECTRONICS, (2) TO OPTIMIZE THE DESIGN OF A NOVEL MONOLITHIC MICROMACHINE THE GYROSCOPE'S PACKAGE. THE RESULTS OF PHASE I WILL BE USED TO BUILD AND COMMERCIALIZE AN SNS IN PHASE II AND III IN COLLABORATION WITH THE EXISTING INDEPENDENT POTENTIAL PARTNERSHIPS.

PRESENT DAY SYSTEMS INCORPORATE HIGH DENSITY CHARGE COUPLED DEVICES (CCD) WITH PIXEL SIZES AS SMALL AS 9 X 9 MICRONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THESE DETECTORS FORM THE HEART OF SOME LASER RANGING/TRACKING SYSTEMS AND ARE INVALUABLE BECAUSE OF THEIR SHORT RISE TIMES AND HIGH SENSITIVITY. HOWEVER, THE INCLUSION OF A LIGHT AMPLIFICATION STAGE BEFORE THE CCD CAN EXTEND THEIR LOW LEVEL RESPONSE RANGE SIGNIFICANTLY. A SUITABLE CHOICE IS THE MICROCHANNEL PLATE (MCP). HOWEVER, THE CONVENTIONAL OPTICAL FIBER BASED CONSTRUCTION OF THE PLATES CAN BE THE LIMITING FACTOR BECAUSE OF THE LARGE PORE SIZE AND COMPONENT SPACING IN TYPICAL INTENSIFIER ARCHITECTURE. ALTERNATE ARCHITECTURE AND INCORPORATION OF SMALL PORE MCPS AND FIBER INTERFACES CAN LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. THE PROPOSED PHASE I EFFORT WILL OPTIMIZE THE COUPLING OF AN MCP TO A CCD TO ACHIEVE HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND INCLUDE AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS TO MODEL THE INCREASE IN PERFORMANCE/COST RATIO EXPECTED FROM THIS COMPOUND SYSTEM. THIS STUDY WILL SERVE AS A FOUNDATION FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING OF THE DETECTOR SYSTEM IN PHASE II. THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN IMPROVED DETECTOR SYSTEM BASED ON THE COMBINATION OF CCDS AND MCPS WILL HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT IN A WIDE VARIETY OF RESEARCH AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS. REMOTE SENSING, LOW LIGHT LEVEL IMAGE FORMATION AND SPECTROSCOPY ARE SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF DIRECT COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS.

The system is based on integrated optical modulator (IOM) coupled to a cw 1.3 mm diode laser and to a high frequency PIN diode photodetector. The main advantage of the external modulation of a laser light, is that modulating frequencies as high as 15 GHz can be very attractive for the proposed application. Recent advantaces in the fabrication of these modulators, based on an Annealed Proton Exchange process, have produced IOMs that are extremely stable for high optical power of a few hundred of milliwatts. A prototype unit will be developed and fully tested under the Phase I effort to demonstrate the functional capabilities of the proposed concept.",

THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR THE NEW GENERATION OF HIGH ENERGY COLLIDERS LIKE THE SUPERCONDUCTING SUPER COLLIDER (SSC), WHERE A HIGH INTENSITY OF NEUTRONS CREATES SERIOUS BULK DAMAGE PROBLEMS. MOST OF THE RADIATION DAMAGE RESEARCH ON THESE DETECTORS HAS FOCUSSED ON STUDIES OF IRRADIATED DEVICE BEHAVIOR IN DETECTORS MADE FROM THE SAME SOURCE OF SI AND BY SIMILAR OXIDE PASSIVATION TECHNIQUES, WITH LITTLE EFFORT TO DATE ON IMPROVING THE MATERIAL. THESE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT NEUTRON BULK DAMAGE CREATES EXCESS LEAKAGE CURRENT NOISE, CHARGE TRAPPING RESULTING IN SIGNAL DETERIORATION, AND CHANGES IN COMPENSATION LEVEL THAT CHANGE THE ELECTRIC FIELD DISTRIBUTION IN THE DEVICE. THIS LAST PROBLEM IS PERHAPS THE MOST SERIOUS, PARTICULARLY FOR TRACKING DEVICES AND DRIFT CHAMBERS. CHANGES IN COMPENSATION LEVEL BY UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTED RADIATION DAMAGE CAN AMPLIFY THE ORIGINAL FLUCTUATIONS IN COMPENSATION, THEREBY CAUSING MAJOR SPATIAL NONUNIFORMITIES IN RESISTIVITY AND ELECTRIC FIELD STRENGTH. ALUMINUM (AL) IS KNOWN TO PASSIVATE BOTH POINT AND CLUSTER DEFECTS IN SI, AND IT IS POSITED THAT AL DOPING MAY BE USEFUL FOR IMPROVING THE RADIATION HARDNESS OF SI DETECTORS. THE PHASE I RESEARCH WILL ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS DOPING METHOD (WHICH INTRODUCES AL INTO THE POLISHED WAFERS OR FINISHED DEVICES). THESE DOPED MATERIALS ARE THEN AVAILABLE FOR PHASE II RADIATION DAMAGE STUDIES. THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE AL INTRODUCTION CAN BE CONTROLLED TO COUNTERACT COMPENSATION GRADIENTS IN THE STARTING MATERIAL.

        "abstract": "Abstract         When making a structure like AlGaAs or SiGe by heteroexpitaxial growth techniques, it would be nice to know when one atomic layer is completed so that the next can be started. The quality of the device depends on accurate control of the thickness and purity of each layer. Currently, no way exists to detect both layer growth and atomic composition during expitaxial processing of electronic and optoelectronic materials. Our proposed method allows detection of layer growth and atomic composition and would give data complementary to RHEED (reflection high energy electron diffraction) which is commonly used to sense the completion of each epilayer (but gives no composition data). We will accomplish this in real time with no instrumental obstruction of the vapor fluxes to the growing film. In addition, we can perform our experiment at pressure of a few mTorr which allows monitoring and control of films grown by LPCVD (low pressure chemical vapor deposition).",

The substrate contains switching circuits to multiplex groups of sixteen detectors onto a common read-out pad. The substrate has deposited on it a checkerboard spectral filter to provide a unique waveband for each of the sixteen detectors. As a result, the 512x512 array can be read out using a 128x128 channel parallel processor. When it is either scanned, a 512x512 image is produced in each of sixteen colors. Coupling of massively parallel signal processing to the MSSR for purposes of atomatic target recognition, aimpoint determination, camouflage penetration, and countermeasure avoidance is enabled without requiring a separate processing channel for each detector element. Initial commercial applications will include security systems followed by high definition television with integrated digital data compression.",

FOR MANUFACTURING PROCESS CONTROL INVOLVING ECR ETCHING IN PRODUCTION OF ELECTRONICS AND OPTO-ELECTRONICS ON SILICON AND COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTORS, CONSIDERABLE FURTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS NEEDED. SPECTROSCOPIC ELLIPSOMETRY USES POLARIZED LIGHT REFLECTANCE, AND HAS SENSITIVITY TO SURFACE AND INTERFACE EFFECTS A FRACTION OF AN ATOMIC MONOLAYER THICK. THUS SURFACE DAMAGE, SURFACE ROUGHNESS, AND SURFACE COMPOUND/ALLOY STOICHIOMETRY CAN BE DETERMINED. WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED THE ABILITY TO CONVERT ELLIPSOMETRIC PSI AND DELTA DATA IN REAL TIME INTO DESIRED MATERIALS PROPERTIES SUCH AS THICKNESS, ALLOY RATIO, SURFACE TEMPERATURE DURING SEMICONDUCTOR CRYSTAL GROWTH.

But microbial paint stripping, an environmentally compatible alternative to chemical and physical paint stripping, is unacceptably slow. The rate of polyurethane deterioration can be markedly enhanced by using the stable enzymes of thermophilic microorganisms. The objective of this proposal is to identify thermophiles with the ability to degrade polyurethane paint. Labratory techniques will be selected for ease of conversion to scaled-up process. Selected microorganisms will be grown in labratory scale reactors to produce the desired enzymes. Using tangential flow technology, enzymes will then be applied to painted test strips with the objective of rapidly digesting polyurethane paint",

IN CURED COMPOSITES, MOISTURE CAUSES THE MATRIX TO SWELL AND SOFTEN WITH A SUBSEQUENT LOSS OF STIFFNESS AND STRENGTH. IT INDUCES RESIDUAL SWELLING STRAINS AND MICROCRACKING, AND IRREVERSIBLY DEGRADES THE FIBER/MATRIX INTERFACE. IN REPAIR, MOISTURE DIFFUSES INTO THE REPAIR ADHESIVE TO CAUSE DETERIORATION AND BLISTERING. IN UNCURED PREPREGS, MOISTURE SLOWS THE FORMATION OF THE POLYMER NETWORK AND INCREASES THE VISCOSITY AND VOID CONTENT. PRELIMINARY MICROWAVE TESTS HAVE SHOWN THAT DIFFUSED MOISTURE HAS A PRONOUNCED EFFECT ON THE MACROSCOPIC DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES OF COMPOSITES. USING AN INNOVATIVE SENSOR DESIGN, THE BULK EFFECTS OF BOTH THE REAL DIELECTRIC CONSTANT AND THE LOSS FACTOR HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO PROVIDE TWO INDEPENDENT EFFECTS OF DIFFUSED MOISTURE. FROM SUCH INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENTS, IT APPEARS POSSIBLE TO QUANTIFY THE CUMULATIVE MOISTURE AND TO EVEN MAKE SOME ASSESSMENT OF THE MOISTURE IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER WHICH OFTEN OCCURS FOLLOWING TRANSIENT EXPOSURE AND DRYING CYCLES. SPECIFIC TASKS FOCUS ON SENSOR DESIGN, THEIR OPTIMIZATION AND USE, MONITORING MOISTURE DIFFUSION INTO CURED COMPOSITES AND PREPREGS, AND MODELING OF THE DIFFUSION PROCESS FOR CORRELATION OF MOISTURE PROFILES WITH THE MICROWAVE MEASUREMENTS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         WASTE REDUCTION CAN BE A HIGHLY COST-EFFECTIVE MEANS OF POLLUTION CONTROL, IF ECONOMIC CHANGES IN THE BASIC TECHNOLOGY CAN BE ACHIEVED WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE RAW MATERIALS USED IN THE PROCESS. BENZENE IS USED AS A CLASSICAL REACTION SOLVENT IN MANY ORGANIC CHEMICAL REACTIONS. AS A SOLVENT, RATHER THAN A BASIC REACTANT, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY ALTERMATE SOLVENT TECHNOLOGIES TO ELIMINATE BENZENE. ELIMINATION OF THE USE OF BENZENE AS A SOLVENT IN A SPECIFIC FREE REDICAL ORGANIC POLYMERIZATION PROCESS IS PROPOSED. PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS INDICATE GREAT PROMISE IN THE USE OF EXCESS LEVELS OF ONE REACTANT AS A BENZENE REPLACEMENT. THE PHASE I EFFORT IS TO DETERMINE THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF THIS TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCT THE POLYMER PRODUCT. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE TECHNOLOGY SHOULD ELIMINATE BENZENE IN EMISSIONS FROM CURRENT PROCESS VENTS, CENTRIFUGES, DRYERS, AND IN FUGITIVE EMISSIONS. ALSO, BECAUSE IT ELIMINATED RESIDUAL BEZENE IN THE POLYMER, IT PREVENTS BENZENE EMISSIONS IN DOWNSTREAM PROCESSORS OF THE PRODUCT. SINCE THE POLYMER IS USED IN PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS, IT ELIMINATES BENZENE HEALTH RISKS TO A WIDE CONSUMER POPULATION. THE BROAD IMPACT OT THIS BENZENE WASTE REDUCTION TECHNOLOGY AND ITS HIGHLY FAVORABLE ECONOMICS MAKE THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY AND IMPORTANT DEMONSTRATION OF THE BENEFITS OF A WASTE REDUCTION PROGRAM.",

CURRENTLY AVAILABLE COMPUTERIZED PROGRAMS FOR ENDOSCOPIC DATA ENTRY ARE UNSATISFACTORY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE PHYSICIANS TO TYPE DATA AND TO ATTAIN INTERMEDIATE SKILL LEVELS IN USING COMPUTERS. IN PHASE I, KURZWEIL APPLIED INTELLIGENCE, INC., HAS DEVELOPED A VOICE-RECOGNITION AND MENU-DRIVEN SYSTEM FOR ENTERING DATA AND GENERATING REPORTS AND HAS DESIGNED THE ARCHITECTURE FOR QUERIES AND THE ASSOCIATION OF IMAGES AND TEXT. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE VOICE-DRIVEN SYSTEM WILL BE QUICKER THAN THE TRADITIONAL DICTATION CYCLE AND MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE THAN KEYBOARD ENTRY SYSTEMS. BASED ON THE PRELIMINARY DATA FROM EIGHT ALPHA SITES, THESE PHYSICIANS HAVE FOUND VOICE RECOGNITION TO BE ACCURATE AND EASY TO USE. ANOTHER ADVANTAGE IS THAT PRINTED REPORTS ARE INSTANTLY READY FOR SIGNATURE. IN PHASE II, THE SOFTWARE WILL BE APPLIED TO OTHER GASTROENTEROLOGIC PROCEDURES, THE VOCABULARY WILL BE MADE COMPLETELY SPEAKER INDEPENDENT. ENDOSCOPISTS ARE COMFORTABLE WITH DICTATION; THUS, VOICE CONTROL OF THE SOFTWARE WILL NOT ONLY ENCOURAGE USE OF THE SYSTEM, BUT WILLALSO PERMIT FASTER, MORE ACCURATE DOCUMENTATION AND FACILITATE MULTICENTER, LONGITUDINAL, AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF DISEASES.",

The proposed design effort will address the problems of search rate, identification, homing, slant range measurement, localization and buoy acknowledgement. The focus of the Phase I effort will be optimization of correct response to address and command while minimizing the probability of a false trigger. The Phase I development model will consist of a waterproof, single channel, control deck unit with a sealed steering and range display and a sea floor unit. The latter unit will operate in a dual mode; a sleep mode where the unit is waiting to be called and an operational mode following awakening. This prototype effort will demonstrate the feasibility of an acoustic buoy release system for shallow water operation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         CERAMICS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN THE DEFEAT OF A WIDE RANGE OF KINETIC ENERGY (KE) THREATS. HOWEVER, THE USE OF CERAMICS IN ARMORED VEHICLES HAS BEEN LIMITED DUE IN MOST PART TO THEIR HIGH COST. CERAMIC PARTICULATE REINFORCED METAL MATRIX COMPOSITES (MMCS) PRODUCED BY PRESSURELESS LIQUID METAL INFILTRATION ARE INEXPENSIVE RELATIVE TO MONOLITHIC CERAMICS DUE TO THE LOWER COST OF THE RAW MATERIALS, THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE THE MMCS TO NET SHAPE, AND THE LOWER COST PROCESSING TECHNIQUE. LIKE CERAMICS, MMCS (CONTAINING HIGH LOADINGS (>60 VOL%) OF CERAMIC PARTICLES) CAN PROVIDE VERY EFFECTIVE BALLISTIC PERFORMANCE VERSUS MANY KE THREATS. IN GENERAL, THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE MMCS CAN BE ENHANCED BY INCREASING THE CERAMIC CONTENT. TO THIS END, THE PRESENT WORK IS PROPOSED. LOW COST NET SHAPE MMCS WILL BE FABRICATED VIA THE PRESSURELESS LIQUID METAL INFILTRATION TECHNIQUE. PROPRIETARY PROCESSING STEPS WILL BE APPLIED TO YIELD A COMPOSITE WITH AN ENHANCED CERAMIC CONTENT. THE FINAL PRODUCT WILL POSSESS THE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES OF THE CURRENT GENERATION OF MMCS, BUT THE INCREASED CERAMIC CONTENT SHOULD RESULT IN IMPROVED BALLISTIC PERFORMANCE. PHASE I WILL STUDY THE PROCESSING AND QUASI-STATIC PROPERTIES OF THESE NOVEL COMPOSITE MATERIALS. THESE MATERAILS WILL BE ECONOMICAL AND ARE ANTICIPATED TO HAVE FAVORABLE BALLISTIC PERFORMANCE VERSUS A VARIETY OF HEAVY THREATS FACED BY MAIN BATTLE TANKS.

THE RESULTS OF CALCULATIONS APPLYING THE JUDD-OFELT APPROXIMATIONS INDICATE A LARGE OSCILLATOR STRENGTH CORRESPONDING TO THIS LASER TRANSITION. THE PROGRAM WILL INVESTIGATE 455 NM STIMULATED EMISSION IN HO:BAY2F8. THISHOST LATTICE IS PROMISING FOR UPCONVERSION PUMPING SINCE IT SUPPORTS UPCONVERSION VIA PAIR PROCESSES FOR EFFICIENT LASER OPERATION. IN ADDITION THIS CRYSTAL HAS LOW ASSOCIATED PHONON ENERGIES, SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCING THE PROBABILITY OF UPPER LASER LEVEL DEPLETION THROUGH NON-RADIATIVE TRANSITIONS. THE 5I8 5I5 PUMP TRANSITION AT 908 NM IS COMPATIBLE WITH STRAINED LAYER INGAAS QUANTUM WELL TECHNOLOGY. THIS IS A VIABLE PUMP LASER TECHNOLOGY SINCE STRAINED QUANTUM WELL DEVICES HAVE DEMONSTRATED HIGH RELIABILITY WITH STRAINED LAYERS NEAR THE CRITICAL THICKNESS. THE 908 NM OUTPUT REQUIRED ACCOMMODATES MUCH NARROWER STRAINED LAYER THICKNESSES RESULTING IN REDUCED STRESS ON THE ACTIVE LAYER AND IMPROVED RELIABLITY OF THE DIODE LASER PUMP SOURCE. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE PROPOSED SYSTEM HOLDS PROMISE FOR EFFICIENT GENERATION OF NARROWBAND LASER RADIATION WHICH ISCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CS ATOMIC RESONANCE FILTER.

HUMAN COLORECTAL CANCER IS A MAJOR PROBLEM IN THE UNITED STATES AND IS SECOND ONLY TO LUNG CANCER AS A CAUSE OF DEATH. A SURGICAL BYPASS COLOSTOMY MODEL TO STUDY COLORECTAL CARCINOGENESIS IN RATS WILL BE DEVELOPED. IN THIS MODEL, A SHORT LOOP OF COLON AT THE JUNCTION OF THE TRANSVERSE AND DESCENDING COLON WILL BE PLACED SURGICALLY OUT OF THE ABDOMINAL WALL TO CREATE TWO OPENINGS. THE PROXIMAL ONE IS THE EXIT FOR FECES AND THE DISTAL ONE IS FOR INTRODUCTION OF CARCINOGENS AND OTHER MODIFIERS OF CARCINOGENESIS. A MICRO COLONOSCOPIC TECHNIQUE WILL BE DEVELOPED TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF TUMORIGENESIS IN THE COLON. IN THE PHASE I PROJECT, THE BYPASS COLOSTOMY MODEL WILL BE PERFORMED IN SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS. THE EFFECTS OF THE CARCINOGENS, 1,2-DIMETHYLHYDRAZINE, METHYLAZOXYMETHANOL ACETATE AND N-METHYL-N-NITROSOUREA WILL BE TESTED BY APPLYING LOCALLY VIA COLOSTOMY AND/OR SYSTEMICALLY.

        "abstract": "Abstract         In assessing future DoD software demands, the US Air Force recognized the need for productivity increases and quality improvements in the computer software development process. To this end, the Software Engineering Institute developed a Capability Maturity Model and companion questionnaire to provide industry with guidance in improving the software development process in software organizations. However, without readily available return-on- investment (ROI) data to justify a company's investment in adopting the model, acceptance has been slow. A recent survey of over 30 firms (primarily DoD) has highlighted the reluctance of industry, without such ROI figures, to accept the DoD's imposition of ever increasing requirements for software process maturity among its contractors. Phase I of this proposal will determine the feasibility of developing a standard model and an industry-wide process improvement data base for computing a software organization's ROI for dollars spent on improving its software development process and for predicting costs for moving to higher levels of maturity. The model and supporting data base, both to be developed in Phase II, will provide managers with an automated tool to assess the cost impact of allocating dollars to various process improvement activities.",

THE METRICS WILL ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF THE GENERALITY AND STANDARDIZATION OF METRICS TO PERMIT CROSS-SYSTEM COMPARISONS. THE DIMENSIONS TO BE INVESTIGATED FOR METRICS DEVELOPMENT WILL INCLUDE: ACCURACY, COMPATIBILITY, CONFORMITY, COMPUTATION EFFICIENCY, COST/BENEFIT, EASE OF USE, FLEXIBILITY, ROBUSTNESS, SPEED, TRANSPORTABILITY, AND UTILITY. INDIVIDUAL METRICS WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR THE FOLLOWING SYSTEM COMPONENTS: SCENE REGISTRATION, IMAGE FEATURE EXTRACTION, SCENE OBJECT MODELLING, THE KNOWLEDGE INTERFACE, AND THE CONTROL TECTURE. THE PROPOSED METRICS WILL BE REVIEWED FOR CONFORMANCE TO TECHNICAL STANDARDS, SUCH AS PRECISION AND VALIDITY, AND FOR OVERALL UTILITY. DETAILED PROCEDURES WILL BE PROVIDED FOR EACH METRIC, TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE APPLICATION. IN ADDITION TO THE METRICS THEMSELVES, WE PROPOSE TO RECOMMEND A WEIGHTING SYSTEM, THAT WILL PERMIT END-USERS AND DEVELOPERS TO AGGREGATE MULTIPLE METRICS INTO A SINGLE MEASURE, REFLECTING THE IMPORTANCE THAT THEY ATTACH TO THE INDIVIDUAL DIMENSIONS AND COMPONENTS. FINALLY, WE WILL DEVELOP A PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE FOR A DATABASE SUPPORTING INFORMATION ACCESS TO METRICS AND PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS TO DATA FROM OTHER EVALUATIONS, AND EVENTUALLY TO BENCHMARK RESULTS. THERE ARE TWO MAJOR BENEFITS ANTICIPATED. THE FIRST IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STANDARD SET OF UNBIASED METRICS THAT WILL PERMIT CROSS-SYSTEM COMPARISONS. THIS WILL BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR PROCUREMENT DECISIONS. THE SECOND IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SET OF STANDARD METRICS FOR THE EVALUATION OF SYSTEM COMPONENTS THAT WILL PERMIT BOTH PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS OF SEPARATE COMPONENTS, AS WELL AS DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION OF THESE COMPONENTS, AND IDENTIFICATION OF FAILURE POINTS AND AREAS MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM IMPROVEMENT.",

POSSIBLE USES FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY INCLUDE STERILIZATION AND REMOVAL OF ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS FROM MEDICAL WASTE WATER AND FOR THE PREPARATION OF STERILE PYROGEN-FREE SOLUTIONS. THE APPROACH IS BASED UPON AN ADVANCED OZONATION PROCESS (I.E., THE COMBINATION OF OZONE WITH HYDROGEN PEROXIDE AND/OR UV LIGHT). AOP'S ARE EFFECTIVE FOR HOSPITAL WASTE WATER TREATMENT AND CAN BE USED FOR THE PREPARATION OF HIGH CHEMICAL PURITY PYROGEN-FREE WATER. HOWEVER, THE COMPLEXITY AND COST OF FORMING OZONE BY THE TRADITIONAL (CORONA DISCHARGE) METHOD RENDER AOP'S IMPRACTICAL FOR MANY MEDICAL APPLICATIONS. LYNNTECH, INC., HAS DEVELOPED AN ELECTROCHEMICAL DEVICE FOR THE PAIRED SYNTHESIS OF OZONE AND HYDROGEN PEROXIDE FROM WATER AND OXYGEN IN A PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE-BASED ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL. THE ELECTROCHEMICAL PROCESS GREATLY SIMPLIFIES OZONE GENERATION AND PROVIDES THE ADDITIONAL BENEFIT OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE FORMATION. THESE FEATURES ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPACT, MODULAR AND EASY-TO-INSTALL CATALYZED OZONE TREATMENT SYSTEMS FOR USE IN FIELD MEDICAL UNITS. RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON DEMONSTRATING PROCESS FEASIBILITY FOR REMOVING TRACE ORGANIC CHEMICALS AND PYROGENS FROM WATER IN A LABORATORY TEST SYSTEM.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The removal of heavy metals and/or radionuclides from contaminated subsurface soils and groundwaters is an expensive and time-consuming part of any contaminated site-cleanup process. Development of new techniques for soil remediation is particularly needed for contaminated sites on which nuclear facilities are located. Many remediation methods investigated have been found to be less than satisfactory due to a combination of their short- and/or long-term ineffectiveness, low removal rates of toxic elemental species and high implementation costs. Decontamination of soil using pulsed DC electric fields is a new novel approach for hazardous waste site remediation based on electrochemically induced transport of contaminants through the soil. This technique has the potential to be effective in facilitating the removal of certain types of hazardous wastes from soils, particularly heavy metals. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate the feasibility of electrochemically based remediation technology for removal of heavy metal contaminants from soil and to implement an innovative approach based on the application of pulsed DC electric fields, in combination with periodic pumping. It is anticipated that increasing the turbulence in the soil/contaminant/water system, both by application of an \"electrochemical stirring\" of the soil and by forced hydraulic flow, will increase the rate of removal of contaminants. Different long-term pulsing-type regimes, including increasing voltage amplitudes and voltage reversals, combined with intermittent pumping, will be investigated in order to enhance the effectiveness of the electrochemically based remediation process.",

BY INSERTING A SIMULATOR OF A HYPOTHETICAL VEHICLE INTO THE SIMNET WORLD, TRADEOFF STUDIES CAN BE PERFORMED ON THE VEHICLE, REFINING THE WEAPON SYSTEM CONCEPT. GREAT COST SAVINGS ARE ENJOYED BY CUTTING DOWN ITERATIVE PROTOTYPING OF REAL HARDWARE. A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS METHODOLOGY, HOWEVER, IS THAT THE DESIGNER OF THESE WEAPON SYSTEMS HAS NO TOOL TO RAPIDLY CREATE THE SIMULATORS HIMSELF. HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS NEED TO BE BROUGHT IN TO THE LOOP, WASTING TIME AND MONEY. IF THE DESIGNER COULD GENERATE THESE SIMULATORS UNASSISTED, THE TIME BETWEEN CONCEPT ITERATIONS WOULD PLUMMET, AS WOULD THE COST. MAK PROPOSES USING OBJECT ORIENTED DESIGN PARADIGMS, STANDARDIZED SOFTWARE INTERFACES, RECONFIGURABLE I/O OBJECTS, AND RECONFIGURABLE CONTROLS TO PROVIDE A WEAPON DESIGNER WITH A WEAPON GENERATION TOOL (WGT) WHICH WOULD ALLOW HIM TO CREATE HIS OWN SIMULATORS FROM A LIBRARY OF PARTS. THIS TOOL WOULD DYNAMICALLY LINK SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE MODULES AT THE REQUEST OF THE DESIGNER, THROUGH AN EASY TO USE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE. THE WGT WILL ACCELERATE THE PROCESS OF WEAPON SYSTEM REFINEMENT, MULTIPLYING THE POWER OF THE SIMNET SIMULATE-BEFORE-YOU-BUILD PROCUREMENT METHODOLOGY. THE WEAPON DESIGNER WILL HAVE AN AS-OF-YET UNAVAILABLE FREEDOM TO EXPLORE NEW AREAS IN COMBAT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT. THE WGT CAN BE USED BY COMMERCIAL VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS FOR TRADEOFF STUDIES IN SIMULATION, SIMILAR TO THE MILITARY WEAPONS DESIGNER.",

THIS MODULAR APPROACH INSULATES THE EXISTING SIMULATOR FROM THE HIGH DEMANDS OF NETWORK PROCESSING, INCREASING THE CAPABILITY OF THE EXISTING SIMULATOR. THE FLEXIBLE PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE SUPPORTS SYSTEM-LEVEL, BOARD-LEVEL, AND SOFTWARE-ONLY PRODUCTS FOR INTEGRATION INTO EXISTING SIMULATORS. THIS ALLOWS THE DAU TO BE USED WITH SYSTEMS WITH WIDELY DIFFERENT TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS. THE FLEXIBLE DESIGN OF THE SOFTWARE ALSO ALLOWS MODIFICATION TO MET THE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX REQUIREMENTS OF DISTRIBUTED INTERACTIVE SIMULATION, ALLOWING THE EXISTING SIMULATORS TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH EVOLVING DIS STANDARDS.

THE POTENTIAL FOR UTILIZATION OF SI(3)N(4) CERAMICS IN MANY APPLICATIONS WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IF ITS FRACTURE TOUGHNESS COULD BE INCREASED WITHOUT SACRIFICING HIGH TEMPERATURE STRENGTH. IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE ABOVE CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH MANIPULATION OF THE MICROSTRUCTURE OF SI(3)N(4) TO PRODUCE A MIXTURE OF ACICULAR AND EQUIAXED GRAINS. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY NANOCOATING INDIVIDUAL SI(3)N(4) PARTICLES WITH RARE EARTH OXIDES (Y(2)O(3), ND(2)O(3), AL(2)O(3) OR SOME COMBINATION). CONTROL OF THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF COATING, AND RATIO OF COATED TO UNCOATED PARTICLES WILL ALLOW CONTROL OF THE RESULTING SI(3)N(4) MICROSTRUCTURE TO EFFECT THE DESIRABLE PROPERTIES.

        "abstract": "Abstract         CURRENT AND FUTURE LEGISLATION WILL REQUIRE U.S. INDUSTRY TO TREAT MANY ORGANIC SOLVENT-CONTAINING AIR STREAMS NOW BEING DISCHARGED TO THE ATMOSPHERE. STREAMS OF THIS TYPE ARE PRODUCED BY PROCESSES SUCH AS PAINT REMOVAL AND METAL DEGREASING, AND IN PAINTING AND COATING OPERATIONS. MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH (MTR) HAS DEVELOPED A MEMBRANE VAPOR RECOVERY PROCESS THAT IS ABLE TO REMOVE SOLVENT VAPORS FROM EFFLUENT AIR STREAMS, AND TO RECOVER A CONDENSED LIQUID SUITABLE FOR REUSE. HOWEVER, THE MEMBRANE SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY IS NOT ECONOMICALLY VIABLE FOR STREAMS CONTAINING LESS THAT 0.5% SOLVENT VAPOR. CARBON ADSORPTION IS USUALLY USED TO TREAT THESE STREAMS. CARBON ADSORPTION IS A RELATIVELY COST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT PROCESS, AND IS PARTICULARLY SUITED TO LOW-CONCENTRATION WASTE STREAMS. HOWEVER, REGENERATION PROCEDURES USE STEAM AND PRODUCE A FINAL WASTE STREAM CONTAINING 5-10% SOLVENT IN WATER. THIS STREAM IS TOO DILUTE TO BE EASILY REUSED AND DISPOSAL IS USUALLY AS A HAZARDOUS WASTE. THE PROCESS MTR PROPOSES TO DEVELOP USES A MEMBRANE VAPOR SEPARATION SYSTEM AS AN INNOVATIVE METHOD OF REGENERATING THE CARBON BED USING HOT NITROGEN, WHICH CAN BE RECYCLED, AND ALLOWING RECOVERY OF THE SOLVENT AS A PURE PRODUCT. SECONDARY WASTE STREAMS ARE ELIMINATED. IN THE PROPOSED PROCESS BOTH TECHNOLOGIES OPERATE IN THEIR MOST FAVORABLE RANGE. THE ECONOMICS OF THE PROCESS APPEAR TO BE ATTRACTIVE.",

BASED ON PRELIMINARY STUDIES OF TITANIUM-MOLYBDENUM-ALUMINUM AND TITANIUM-VANADIUM- ALUMINUM ALLOYS, IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT AN ELASTIC MODULUS RANGE FROM 2.5 TO 9 X 106PSI, A 360% VARIATION, CAN BE ACHIEVED IN THESE SYSTEMS. THEIR ASSURED BIO-COMPATIBILITY, BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF TITANIUM ALLOYS IN ORTHOPEDICS, AND THEIR COMBINATION OF SHAPE MEMORY EFFECT AND SUPER-ELASTIC BEHAVIOR, MAKES A CASE FOR FURTHER RESEARCH TO CHARACTERIZE THE PROPERTIES OF THESE TWO TERNARY ALLOYS. BEING NICKEL FREE ANY OF THE ADVERSE TISSUE REACTIONS OBSERVED IN PEOPLE SENSITIVE TO THIS ELEMENT WOULD BE AVOIDED. TO COMMERCIALIZE THESE ALLOYS, FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PROPERTIES REQUIRED FOR ORTHODONTIC APPLICATION AND ALLOY COMPOSITION AND HEAT TREATMENT IS NEEDED.

IT IS OF INCREASING IMPORTANCE IN BOTH BASIC UNIVERSITY-SPONSORED RESEARCH AND IN APPLIED RESEARCH WITHIN INDUSTRY TO HAVE ACCESS TO L-AROGENATE AS A SUBSTRATE FOR A NUMBER OF NEWLY DESCRIBED ENZYMES, FOR USE IN VARIOUS NUTRITIONAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS, FOR USE AS AUTHENTIC STANDARDS, AND FOR USE AS STARTING MATERIAL IN THE MAKING OF DERIVATIVE COMPOUNDS. BECAUSE OF THE PLACEMENT OF THE COMPOUND WITHIN DIVERSE PATTERNS OF AROMATIC-AMINO-ACID PATHWAY CONSTRUCTION AND REGULATION, DERIVATIVES OF L-AROGENATE HAVE POTENTIAL FOR DESIGN OF ANTIMICROBIAL AND HERBICIDAL COMPOUNDS. L-AROGENATE IS CURRENTLY PRODUCED AT GREAT EXPENSE (OVER $10 PER MG) AS A MINOR ACCUMULATION ENTITY IN NEUROSPORA CRASSA, IN AN INITIAL PREPARATION HEAVILY CONTAMINATED WITH OTHER CYCLOHEXADIENYL COMPOUNDS PRODUCED FROM PREPHENATE. WE WILL CONSTRUCT A MULTIPLE MUTANT OF BREVIBACTERIUM FLAVUM THAT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE THE YIELD OF L-AROGENATE BY A FACTOR OF 10-TO-100 OR MORE, WITH LITTLE OR NO SIDE- PRODUCTION OF INTERFERING CYCLOHEXADIENYL COMPOUNDS.",

There is currently NO DoD HRSCC dtatbase which meets the requirements for medium and long-range cloud forecasts. The HRSCC's show the frequency of occurence of cloud cover, spatial distribution of clouds, and cloud cover amount, and can be stratified by cloud type and cloud height. They are produced from both archived and real-time data streams, and are produced exclusively from satellite imagery. Phase I will determine how HRSCC's can be produced from the USAF Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) digital imagery and will demonstrate how these new products can be applied to meet USAF operational requirements. These new high-resolution cloud products are unique, and rely on innovative image processing techniques to make use of current technology meteorological satellite imagery. We will demonstrate how HRSCC's can serve as both an assessment and foecast tool. We believe this type of product has the potential to become standard cloud climatology reference for DOD. There is excellant potential for long term product development with applications for both the DOD and civilian operations that are impacted by clouds.",

We plan to modify our existing R Cubed Transponder (AN/URY-3) design to yield a 400 percent increase in data throughput and add a GPS receiver and Inertial Guidance unit for improved position location of training participants. Our goal is to design a secure Data Relay System operating at 141 MHz with a 4 MHZ bandwidth that will have an instantaneous data rate of at least l Megabit. To optimize participant data handling capacity, Microcom's Phase I study will determine the feasibility of reducing the present PPM pulse spacing by a factor of 4 (thereby increasing the data rate by 4 times). In addition, alternate technical approaches will be investigated and computer simulations will be conducted to verify anticipated data relay performance. Issues that will be addressed in the Phase I study will include correlation gain, link margin per- formance, transmitter reliability, secure transmission, size and weight, primary power requirements, and environmental requirements. In addition to the engineering analysis, Microcom will prepare a design plan and submit a preliminary system design specification which will be the basis for development and test of a data relay system in the Phase II project.",

The proposed system will operate in conjunction with Link-11 and will transmit the same tactical data to submarines that the rest of the Battle Group receives on a real-time basis.

RECORD HIGH MICROWAVE POWER AND ENERGY COULD BE ACHIEVED, IF ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE 3.6 TW ELECTRON BEAM POWER ON EACH OF THE FOUR OUTPUT LINES CAN BE COUPLED OUT. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE PROPOSE A NEW CONCEPT TO GENERATE HIGH POWER MICROWAVES ON AURORA. THIS CONCEPT EMPLOYS PLASMA WAKEFIELD PHENOMENON TO BUNCH HIGHCURRENT RELATIVISTIC ELECTRON BEAMS. MICROWAVE ENERGY IS EXTRACTED OUT OF THE BUNCHED BEAMS VIA ONE OR MORE RESONANT CAVITIES, SIMILAR TO THAT IN KLYSTRONS. IT APPEARS FROM INITIAL ESTIMATES THAT HIGH POWER MICROWAVE GENERATION AT A FREQUENCY ON THE ORDER OF 1 GHZ WITH SEVERAL TENS OF PERCENT EFFICIENCY IS FEASIBLE. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PHASE I PROGRAM ARE TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH ON AURORA WITH THEORY AND PIC SIMULATORS, TO DESIGN A PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE EXPERIMENT TO BE PERFORMED ON TEMPO EARLY IN THE PHASE II PROGRAM, AND TO COMPLETE A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF A FULL AURORA EXPERIMENT TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE LATER PART OF THE PHASE II PROGRAM.",

THIS DIAGNOSTIC EMPLOYS A LOW ENERGY ( 50 KEV), LOW CURRENT ( 1MUA) STREAM OF IONS TO PROBE THE CHARGED PARTICLE BEAM. THE PROBE IONS ARE INJECTED ACROSS THE PATH OF THE RELATIVISTIC BEAM AND ARE DEFLECTED BY THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS OF THE BEAM. THE DIRECTION AND MAGNITUDE OF THE DEFLECTION DEPENDS ON THE CURRENT, POSITION, DURATION, RADIUS, AND CHARGE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RELATIVISTIC BEAM. CONSEQUENTLY, BY A SUITABLE CHOICE OF OPERATING PARAMETERS, THE ION PROBE CAN RESOLVE SOME OR ALL OF THESE QUANTITIES. THIS TYPE OF DIAGNOSTIC CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN A VARIETY OF ACCELERATORS. HOWEVER, THIS PROJECT IS PRIMARILY INTERESTED IN RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) ACCELERATORS AND TIGHTLY-FOCUSED (MICRON OR SUBMICRON DIAMETER) BEAMS, BECAUSE CONVENTIONAL DIAGNOSTICS ARE UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY RESOLVE THE MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF THIS KIND OF BEAM. INITIAL CALCULATIONS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE ION PROBE CAN RESOLVE BEAM POSITION TO WITHIN <<1 MUM AND CAN ACCURATELY MEASURE MANY DETAILS OF THE CHARGE DISTRIBUTION. THE ENERGY OF THE PROBE IONS CAN BE ADJUSTED SO THAT THE DIAGNOSTIC OPERATES WITH HIGH RESOLUTION OVER A VERY BROAD RANGE OF RELATIVISTIC BEAM PARAMETERS. IN PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT DETAILED ANALYSES WILL BE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE OPERATING RANGE AND OPTIMUM PARAMETERS OF THE ION PROBE AND TO DEVELOP A DETAILED DESIGN OF THE DIAGNOSTIC. A PROTOTYPE WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND TESTED AT AN EXISTING RF LINAC FACILITY DURING PHASE II.",

IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODELING, SPH HAS UNRIVALED SIMPLICITY AS A GRIDLESS, LAGRANGIAN TECHNIQUE. IN SPH, THE CONCEPT OF FLUID ELEMENTS DEFINED BY A GRID IS REPLACED BY A COLLECTION OF PARTICLES, OR MASS POINTS, WITH FLUID PROPERTIES SUCH AS MASS, VELOCITY, AND PRESSURE DEFINED AT THE PARTICLE POSITIONS. THUS, SPH AVOIDS PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH MESH TANGLING AND DISTORTION, WHICH ARE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODELING. A SERIAL SPH CODE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND IS IN USE AT BOTH LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY AND LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY. IN PHASE I, A SCHEME TO EFFICIENTLY PARALLELIZE THE SPH TECHNIQUE IS BEING DEVELOPED TO EXPLOIT THE CAPABILITIES OF NEW HIGH PERFORMANCE MACHINES. THE SCHEME WILL ACHIEVE DYNAMIC LOAD BALANCE THROUGH THE USE OF GLOBAL SPATIAL DECOMPOSITION. NEAREST NEIGHBORS ARE BEING IDENTIFIED BY USING A DISTRIBUTED OCTTREE. ALGORITHMS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED ON A 16-NODE INTEL IPSC/860. THE CODE IS BEING BENCHMARKED AGAINST A SERIAL VERSION, AND LOAD BALANCE AND COMMUNICATION INEFFICIENCIES ARE BEING MEASURED.

Significant aspects of this program include: - human factors analysis to define reuqired control characteristics - development of 'breadboard' software and hardware to create a typical display compensation stimulus - demonstration of correction in a mock cockpit setup The objective of this efort as proposed is to create Automatic Display Cockpit Control as opposed to merely Automatic Brightness Control which may not render an electronic display optimally visable under all conditions to be encountered.

Most existing x-ray laser drivers are huge (1000s of square feet of floor space), expensive ($10,000,000+), have a low repetition rate (1/hr), are complex and require several PhDs to keep them working. Thus applications of present x-ray lasers are limited. In contrast, the proposed laser will occupy only a few square feet of floor space, will be light weight, and will have a high repetition rate several pulses/minute). If successful, the proposed laser will have application in space, in biology, in surface analysis, in medicine, x-ray lithography, x-ray holography, x-ray microscopy, atomic spectroscopy, metrology, etc. The driver is based on a capillary plasma discharge. A computer model that calculates ion level's populations in plasma will be developed. Strong laser transitions will be identified and calculated. A preliminary design will be based on calculations. This design will be used for phase II experiments and prototypes.",

AND XANTHOMONAS CAMPESTRIS PV ASCLEPIADIS. THESE TWO DISEASES ARE THE PRINCIPAL OBSTACLES TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMERCIAL MILKWEED INDUSTRY. THEY CAM REDUCE THE YIELD OF FLOSS BY 75%. RESULTS FROM SOME PRELIMINARY STUDIES IN THE GREENHOUSE AND OBSERVATION IN THE FIELD INDICATE THAT SOME OF THE ECOTYPES OF TWO SPECIES OF MILKWEED, ASLEPAIS SYRICA, A. SPECIOSA AND A VIRIDE MAY PROVIDE RESISTANCE TO THESE TWO DISEASES. HOWEVER, A RIGOROUS TEST IN THE GREENHOUSE INVOLVING AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF BLACK SPOT AND BACTERIAL BLIGHT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TWO SPECIES OF MILKWEED POSSESS TRUE RESISTANCE TO THESE DISEASES. METHODS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ESTABLISHED FOR GROWING INOCULUM AND FOR INOCULATING AND INFECTING MILKWEED PLANTS WITH THE PATHOGENS OF BLACK SPOT AND BACTERIAL BLIGHT. THUS, THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON COLLECTING AND ANALYZING THE RESPONSES OF THE THREE SPECIES OF MILKWEED.

THE VENOMS OF PARASITIC WASPS ARE KNOWN TO HAVE A WIDE RANGE OF EFFECTS ON THEIR HOSTS, INCLUDING PARALYSIS, GROWTH REGULATION, AND SUPPRESSION OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. THE BASE BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY OF PARASITIC WASPS SUGGESTS THAT THEIR VENOMS ARE A POTENTIALLY RICH SOURCE OF POTENT, SELECTIVE, INSECTICIDAL TOXINS WITH NOVEL, USEFUL CHEMISTRIES AND MODES OF ACTION. SUCH TOXINS MAY BE EXPECTED TO SERVE AS LEADS FOR DEVELOPING NEW CLASSES OF SYNTHETIC CHEMICAL INSECTICIDES AND AS THE BASIS FOR RECOMBINANT BIOPESTICIDES. ALTHOUGH AVAILABLE DATA ARE LIMITED, THEY SUGGEST THAT THESE VENOMS MAY PROVIDE THE MOST POTENT INSECT-SPECIFIC TOXINS IDENTIFIED TO DATE. WE HAVE PREPARED A LIST OF TAXONOMICALLY DIVERSE SPECIES, THE VENOMS OF WHICH ARE LIKELY TO CONTAIN PARALYTIC ACTIVITIES. IN PHASE I, VENOM GLAND OR WHOLE WASP EXTRACTS WILL BE SURVEYED FOR INCAPACITATING ACTIVITIES AGAINST IMPORTANT LEPIDOPTERAN CROP PEST.

QUALITY OF LIFE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS AN IMPORTANT OUTCOME IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND CLINICAL RESEARCH. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL WELL-ESTABLISHED QOL MEASURES ALREADY EXIST, MOST ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR LARGE-SCALE CLINICAL TRIALS OR FOR HIV/AIDS. THE FINAL PRODUCT OF THIS INITIATIVE WILL BE AN EASILY ADMINISTERED MULTI-DIMENSIONAL QUALITY OF LIFE MEASURE, DESIGNED ESPECIALLY FOR HIV/AIDS, THAT IS SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO DISCRIMINATE QOL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES IN CLINICAL TRIALS EVALUATING MEDICAL OR TREATMENT INTERVENTIONS. STANDARD PROCEDURES FOR SCALE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE USED: (1) INTERVIEWS WITH PERSONS WITH HIV OR AIDS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WORKING PREDOMINANTLY WITH HIV/AIDS PATIENTS; (2) DEVELOPMENT OF A POOL OF ITEMS THAT TAP DIFFERENT DIMENSION S OF QOL; (3) DEVELOPMENT OF A RESPONSE SCALE; (4) CONSTRUCTION OF A DRAFT INSTRUMENT CONTAINING ITEMS ON EACH DIMENSION; AND (5) REVIEW OF THE DRAFT INSTRUMENT BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS.

It can also determine the concentration of gases along a measurement path, or the size of particles or thin films. An excellent way to rapidly obtain spectra is with a Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer which allows detection of all regions of the spectrum simultaneously. What's new is a unique FT-IR sensor which is fast, small, totally vibration tolerant, and permanently aligned. The new FT-IR is based on a novel dynamically balanced interferometer which reduces the affect of external vibrations by over a factor of 100. The Phase I is a joint venture between Advanced Fuel Research, Inc. and On-Line Technologies, Inc formed to commercialize FT-IR technology.

TECHNIQUES ARE PROPOSEDWHICH WILL ALLOW THE MAJORITY OF THE 1 METER CAVITIES TO BE INSULATED WITH ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE GAS (SULPHUR HEXAFLUORIDE), RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT SIMPLIFICATIONS TO THE DESIGN AND COOLING OF SUCH ACCELERATORS. THE MODULE WHICH WILL BE DEVELOPED WILL ALSO BE TESTED IN VACUUM FOR COMPARISON, AND TO ESTIMATE THE HEATING OF THE STRUCTURE IN VACUUM. THE MODULAR APPROACH WHICH WE ARE USING SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE FAULT TOLERANCE AND OVERALL RELIABILITY OF THE ACCELERATOR. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE COSTS OFHIGH POWER RF ACCELERATORS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED, AND THE POWER LEVELS OF THESE ACCELERATORS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED.",

BY BUILDING UP A DC HIGH POWER SOURCE FROM A NUMBER OF DC HIGH VOLTAGE MODULES WHICH ARE NESTED INSIDE ONE ANOTHER, VERY HIGH VOLTAGES CAN BE PRODUCED IN SMALL PACKAGES. NO TWO CONDUCTORS NEED TO BE INSULATED FOR VOLTAGES EXCEEDING 50-100 KV. PULSE DISCHARGE CAPACITORS OR PULSE FORMING NETWORKS CAN BE PLACED INSIDE EACH CELL IN ORDER TO PRODUCE FLATTOPPED PULSES. THIS CONFIGURATION CAN BE USED TO EITHER DRIVE A SEPARATE ELECTRON BEAM GENERATOR, OR THE ELECTRON BEAM CAN BE PRODUCED INSIDE THE GENERATOR ITSELF. THE NESTED GENERATOR CAN ALSO BE CONFIGURED FOR EFFICIENT ENERGY RECOVERY EVEN WHEN THE BEAM ELECTRONS HAVE LOST DIFFERING AMOUNTS OF ENERGY. IN THIS PAPER, A DETAILED INVESTIGATION OF THE POSSIBLE CONFIGURATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED. EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON DEVELOPING THE CONVENTIONAL PULSE POWER GENERATOR CONFIGURATION, INCLUDING ASSOCIATED SWITCHING AND PULSE FORMING ISSUES. EXPERIMENTS WILL ALSO BE PERFORMED ON THE EXISTING NESTED HIGH VOLTAGE GENERATOR AT NSRC IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE ACHIEVABLE VOLTAGE GRADIENT ON THE INSULATION MATERIAL USED IN THE EXPERIMENT.

THIS MAY RENDER THE MATERIAL UNSUITABLE FOR USE, AS IN THE CASE WHERE IT MUST BE IN SLICES TO BE USEFUL. THIS NEW TECHNIQUE PERMITS THE DETERMINATION OF THE INDEX OF ANY SLICE OF MATERIAL, WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL SURFACE PREPARTION OTHER THAN SIMPLE POLISHING. THE TECHNIQUE IS ACCURATE TO FIVE SIGNIFICANT FIGURES AND PROVIDES THE INDEX AT ANY DESIRED WAVELENGTH, AS WELL AS A PROFILE OF THE INDEX OF THE ENTIRE SAMPLE. THE TECHNIQUE COMPARES THE FRINGE PATTERN FROM THE TOP SURFACE WITH THAT FROM A REFERENCE MIRROR TO DETERMINE THE THICKNESS. THEN, WITH THE AID OF A WHITE LIGHT SOURCE, THE INTERFERENCE PATTERN FROM THE BACK SURFACE IS COMPARED WITH THAT FROM THE FRONT TO YIELD THE OPTICAL THICKNESS OF THE SAMPLE. THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO MEASUREMENTS GIVES THE INDEX. THE BACK SURFACE FRINGE PATTERN ITSELF GIVES THE INDEX PROFILE.",

IT WILL BE PRIMARILY DEVELOPED AND DESIGNED FOR X-RAY INSPECTION OF MUNITION ITEMS. IT IS EXPECTED TO HAVE STRONG POTENTIAL TO WORK CONTINUOUSLY UNDER HIGH X-RAY FLUXES WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT DEGRADATION OF ITS PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. IT HAS EXCELLENT SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF 40 MICRON X40 MICRON OR LARGER. IT ALSO HAS X-RAY PHOTON DIRECTION MEASUREMENT CAPABILITY WITH AN ANGULAR RESOLUTION OF ABOUT 1 DEGREE. THIS INFORMATION CAN LEAD TO 3-DIMENSIONAL IMAGING CAPABILITY. IT WILL ALSO HELP IDENTIFY AND REDUCE SCATTERED X-RAY PHOTON BACKGROUND. THE ENERGY OF THE X-RAY PHOTONS CAN BE MEASURED WITH AN ENERGY RESOLUTION OF ABOUT 5% AT L MEV. THIS WILL ALSO ENABLE THE IDENTIFICATION AND REJECTION OF THE SCATTERED X-RAY PHOTONS, WHICH WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE THE BACKGROUND, ESPECIALLY IF MONOENERGETIC X-RAY SOURCES ARE USED. THE PROPSED DETECTOR ALSO HAS HIGH SENSITIVITY WHICH WILL HELP REDUCE X-RAY SOURCE STRENGTH AND ENABLE THE IMAGING OF HIGH DENSITY AND/OR LARGE MUNITION ITEMS. THE DETECTOR CAN BE EASILY SCALED UP OR DOWN IN SIZE TO ADJUST ITS SENSITIVITY TO MATCH THE SIZE AND DENSITY OF ITEMS UNDER INSPECTION. IT WILL HAVE REAL TIME DATA ANALYSIS AND IMAGING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE FOR INSTANTANEOUS IMAGING OF MUNITION ITEMS.

BOTH OF THESE PROCESSES COULD BE INHIBITED BY PREVENTING MONOCYTE RECRUITMENT TO LESION SITES. PRESENT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE MONOCYTE CHEMOATTRACTANT PROTEIN-1 (MCP-1) PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS PROCESS. THE MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS THEREFORE TO FIND INHIBITORS OF MCP-1 GENE EXPRESSION IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THEIR THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL FOR INHIBITION OR PREVENTION OF ATHEROGENESIS.

QUANTUM-LINE RESONANT (NON-RAYLEIGH) MOLECULAR BACKSCATTER ON THE OTHER HAND IS SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE STRONGER. THE FIRST METHOD WE PROPOSE WOULD USE GAS CORRELATION SPECTROSCOPY TO DETECT A SMALL DOPPLER SHIFT IN A BROAD CO2 EMISSION LINE. THIS METHOD DOES NOT REQUIRE SPATIAL OR TEMPORAL COHERENCE BETWEEN THE EMITTED LIGHT AND RECEIVED SIGNAL. THE SECOND METHOD WE PROPOSE FOR MEASURING MOLECULAR DOPPLER SHIFT IS TO COUNT ZERO CROSSINGS IN A RETURN SIGNAL AFTER IT HAS BEEN HETERODYNED WITH A REFERENCE LASER BEAM. THIS METHOD HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR MAKING VERY ACCURATE AIRCRAFT TRUE AIRSPEED MEASUREMENTS. THE PROPOSED EFFORT WILL INVESTIGATE THE RELATIVE ADVANTAGES OF THESE TWO TECHNIQUES.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Optivision, Inc. will design, demonstrate, and evaluate a method of externally modulating light in a waveguide, utilizing the surface plasmon polariton (SPP), a high-intensity two-dimensional electromagnetic wave tightly confined to a metal-dielectric interface, by coupling with quantized charge oscillations. The proposed SPP modulator device is in contact with a waveguide and consists of: 1.) a thin dielectric buffer layer; 2.) a thin metal film of a few hundred atomic layers; 3.) an electroptic material; and 4.) the outer electrode. A prototype modulator will be designed and fabricated on a single-mode fiber using a thin-film deposition technique. When the electrically-controllable refractive index of the EO layer is made equal to the effective guided mode index, complete transfer of the wavguide light to SPPs occurs through evanescent wave coupling, so that modulation is achieved by changes in the applied voltage. Unlike conventional devices, as SPP device can be rugged and low cost, broadband, operating at very high frequencies in the 850nm, 1300nm, and 1550nm wavelength windows with low insertion losses and no back reflections. The high sensitivity of SPP excitation means that such a modulator can operate at very low voltages. The feasibility of two-dimensional configurations will also be studied.",

TWO TIMEFREQUENCY REPRESENTATIONS APPROPRIATE FOR THIS SIGNAL CLASS ARE THE WIGNER-VILLE TRANSFORM AND THE GABOR REPRESENTATION. THE WIGNER TENDS TO HAVE SOMEWHAT HIGHER RESOLUTION CAPABILITY THAN GABOR, BUT ITS QUADRATIC FUNCTION OF THE SIGNAL LEADS TO CROSS-TERMS IN THE TRANSFORM THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO CLASSIFY IN THE PRESENCE OF NOISE. THE GABOR HAS SOMEWHAT LESS RESOLUTION, BUT ITS LINEAR FUNCTION OF THE SIGNAL LEADS TO MORE UNDERSTANDABLE EFFECTS IN THE PRESENCE OF NOISE. THIS PROPOSAL SUGGESTS TWO APPROACHES TO UTILIZE THE GABOR BASIS FUNCTIONS FROM THE GABOR REPRESENTATION THAT CAN BE USED TO ENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE WIGNER TRANSFORM IN THE PRESENCE OF NOISE. THE PRIMARY BENEFIT WILL BE AN IMPROVED WIGNER TECHNIQUE FOR ANALYZING ACOUSTIC TRANSIENT SIGNALS IN NOISE FOR A KEY DOD PROGRAM TO EXPLOIT THESE TRANSIENTS AS A MEANS TO FIND QUIET SUBMARINES.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Air defense Systems of distributed ground and airborne tracking radars are beset with problems when fusing track data at a central command site. This occurs when one or more of the tracking radars produces a track scene with component track offsets (or biases) from the true target location by a constant amount. The offsets are created by a number of mechanisms, including imprecise knowledge of the radar's absolute location and electromagnetic (EM) propogation anomalies such as ducting. The result is that two track scenes from different radar sites will be incorrectly fused if the track offsets are not properly accounted for. This proposal will attempt to circumvent these problems by using a novel approach called \"noncooperative target sensor registration\" (NCTSR). This is in contrast to the cooperative target sensor registration (CTSR) algorithms in existence today. The technical approach is a two step problem. First, a track scene-to- scene matching is performed using an optimal assignment algorithm (like Munkres') to identify common targets in the two track scenes. Next, the track pairs that pertain to common targets are passed through another optimization procedure to generate the offset state vector to correct the tracks. This approach has the virtue of operating on the actual targets that are present -- it does not rely on scheduling a known and cooperating target to fly calibrated trajectories for it to operate properly. Thus, it is possible to obtain near continual updates on the radar track offsets without having to expend considerable resources to compute these offsets. The bottom-line is we obtain more accurate track scenes when performing data fusion in a distributed sensor environment.",

Company proposes using novel gas atomized powders to join electronic componentry. Powders will be fabricated which effectively \"melt\" and fuse well below their known melt temperature. Through low temperature fusion of high temperature alloy powders, gains in solder joint strength exceeding 400% are anticipated.

The presence of aluminum also makes it difficult to fabricate high performance laser diodes using more than one epitaxial growth step because of oxidation that takes place upon exposure to the atmosphere. By replacing the claddings with layers of Indium Gallium Phosphide grown on Gallium Arsenide substrates, lasers entirely free of aluminum can be fabricated. We will fabricate simple aluminum free laser structures and perform high temperature accelerated aging tests to compare them with similar lasers containing aluminum. High power, reliable laser diodes fabricated with multiple epitaxial growths could revolutionize fields such as satellite communications and optical computer interconnections.",

THE VALUE OF THIS SENSOR SYSTEM IS IN BIOASSAYS BASED ON MEASURING OXYGEN METABOLISM IN CELL CULTURES, CELL TOXICITY STUDIES, DRUG TESTING, AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY TESTING. THE AIMS OF PHASE I ARE TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF THE SENSOR DESIGN FOR ACCURATELY DETERMINING THE RATE AND QUALITY OF CELLS' OXYGEN RESPIRATION DURING NORMAL GROWTH AND UNDER VARIOUS TOXIC OR STIMULATORY CONDITIONS. THE SENSOR IS FABRICATED BY AFFIXING A PHOSPHORESCENT INDICATOR COMPOUND TO THE DISTAL TIP OF A FIBEROPTIC. EXCITATION LIGHT PROJECTED THROUGH THE FIBER EXCITES THE PHOSPHOR, WHICH EMITS A WAVELENGTH-SHIFTED LONG-LIFETIME DECAY SIGNAL RETURNED TO A DETECTOR. THE PHOSPHOR'S EMISSION IS AFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF OXYGEN, WHICH QUENCHES THE LONG-LIFETIME LUMINESCENCE. IT IS THEREBY PRACTICAL TO OPTICALLY TRACK OXYGEN LEVELS IN THE MICROENVIRONMENT OF CELLS AT THE SENSOR TIP BASED ON THE LIFETIME OF THE PHOSPHORESCENCE.",

The project consists of experimentation to demonstrate characteristics of SSAT that promote data bus survivability, including embedment within conventional composite layers and sandwiching between laminate layers. Also, the project will demonstrate the integration of the data bus structure with fiber optic techniques for monitoring fatigue, strain and temperature. Interest in robust fiber-optic communication and sensing systems is widespread, particularly for aerospace, medical and robotic applications. Many of these applications are likely to occur in hazardous environments where the survivability enhancement techniques described in this proposal would be of great commercial interest. Integration of data bus and sensor structures with a common fiber-optic based technology offers a significant system cost opportunity.",

Compared to the current poppet-kicker port cycle, and poitentially higher impact energy. The proposed mechanism eliminates heavily loaded sliding elements, a chief problem in current mechanisms. The pistonless impact mechanism requires no protective coatings or complex, close tolerance machaning. It relies on abrupt deceleration of a rapidly moving water column to create a waterhammer at the bottom of the drive cylinder. By simplifying the impact mechanism, it offers increased reliability and lower manufacturing costs while retaining compatability with existing seawater hydraulic power supplies. In Phase I, we will design a waterhammer impact mechanism and perform proof-of-principal tests to demonstrate the feasibility of the impact mechanism. If proven feasibile, we will design a waterhammer-driven rock drill to be fabricated and tested in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Creare is developing a novel technique for forming biaxially oriented thin and thick films of high temperature superconductor YBa(2)Cu(3)O(x) on non-lattice matched substrates. These films should display high critical current densities because they will avoid the weak link problem that occurs between misaligned grains. Presently, the only effective means of achieving biaxial alignment is to either deposit films onto a limited selection of lattice matched single crystal substrates which are expensive, or by melt texturing techniques which are extremely slow. This project will establish the feasibility of Creare's seeded liquid precursor technology for production of biaxially oriented YBCO films on polycrystalline MgO substrates. Our technique is amenable to either large area thin films or continuous processing for the production of wires and tapes and offers an economical and technical solution to YBCO application limitations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Creare is developing an innovative capillary-based evaporator component for direct cooling of advanced electronic modules and for interfacing with capillary pumped thermal management loops for spacecraft. A reentrant capillary structure design will increase by an order of magnitude the pumping capacity of the capillary surface. Compared with current porous wick evaporators, this evaporator will have four advantages: (1)capillary pumping head 2 to 3 times larger, (2)much lower hydraulic pressure losses in the liquid transport channels, (3)much simpler geometry allowing for easier design and analysis of performance for system applications, and (4) high effective thermal conductance per unit area (50 to 100 W/cm2 degrees Celsius) to handle high power densities. The combination of high pumping capacity and high thermal conductance will result in compact, low weight thermal management systems for cooling electronics on spacecraft. Use of this evaporator in a capillary pumped loop applied to a wide range of satellite applications, including advanced radar satellites of interest to SDIO and Air Force and for EOS satellites. Another commerical application of great potential is the development of a high heat flux cold plate for cooling rack-mounted electronics.",

EXISTING METHODS RELY ON EMPIRICAL OR QUALITATIVE METHODS THAT EITHER PRECLUDE CONCURRENT ENGINEERING OR ARE NOT BASED UPON THE PROCESS PHYSICS. EXISTING TCAD TOOLS WERE DEVELOPED FOR PROCESS AND DEVICE DESIGN BUT DO NOT ALLOW FOR STUDY OF CIRCUIT PERFORMANCE VARIANCE. THE PROPOSED TOOL WILL AUTOMATE THE TRANSFER OF INFORMATION BETWEEN PROCESS DEVELOPERS AND CIRCUIT DESIGNERS. BASED ON PDF'S SIMULATION ENGINE, THE TOOL WILL MODEL BOTH DEVICE AND CIRCUIT VARIABILITY BASED ON INHERENT FLUCTUATIONS IN PROCESS CONTROLS AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES. PROCESS AND CIRCUIT DESIGN ENGINEERS WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO DESIGN NEW PROCESSES AND CIRCUITS THAT ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO MANUFACTURING VARIABILITY. A PROTOTYPE VERSION OF THE TOOL WILL CALCULATE STATISTICALLY ACCURATE WORST CASE DEVICE MODELS FOR CIRCUIT SIMULATION. PRESENT METHODS OF WORST CASE DEVICE DESIGN ARE AD HOC AND DO NOT ALLOW THE CONCURRENT APPLICATION OF DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURABILITY TO THE PROCESS AND CIRCUIT. PDF SOLUTIONS IS A TCAD SOFTWARE DEVELOPER WHOSE CHARTER IS TO PROVIDE SOFTWARE APPLYING PROCESS SIMULATION TO DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURABILITY AND MANUFACTURE ANALYSIS. AS SUCH, IT IS IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO DELIVER THE PROPOSED TOOL. THIS PHASE I PROJECT WILL RESULT IN A SPECIFICATION FOR THE STATISTICAL DESIGN TOOL AND THE ADDITIONAL FEATURE REQUIRED OF A TCAD FRAMEWORK TO SUPPORT THE ANALYSIS. A PROTOTYPE VERSION OF THE TOOL WHICH CALCULATES WORST CASE DEVICE MODELS WILL ALSO BE DEVELOPED FOR CONCEPT VERIFICATION.",

THE TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENES, RB, P53, AND DCC HAVE BEEN CLONED. THE P53 GENE WAS ORIGINALLY THOUGHT TO BE A DOMINANT ONCOGENE. HOWEVER, RECENT DATA SUGGEST THAT P53 IS A TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENE. MANY PROPERTIES OF P53 PROTEIN ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE PROTOTYPE TUMOR SUPPRESSOR RB PROTEIN. WE HAVE RECENTLY DEVELOPED ANTI-RB MAB-BASED IMMUNOASSAYS TO STUDY RB PROTEIN EXPRESSION IN HUMAN OSTEOSARCOMAS AND OTHER SOFT-TISSUE SARCOMAS. OUR RESULTS REVEAL THAT THE ABSENCE OF RB PROTEIN IN THESE TUMORS MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROGNOSTIC VALUE. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PRODUCE A PANEL OF MABS AGAINST DISTINCT EPITOPES OF THE HUMAN P53 PROTEIN. THESE MABS WILL BE USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC IMMUNOASSAYS FOR P53-RELATED CANCERS. THESE MABS WILL ALSO BE USEFUL FOR ASSESSING THE FUNCTION OF THE P53 PROTEIN IN HUMAN NEOPLASIA. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE: 1) TO GENERATE A PANEL OF MABS RECOGNIZING DISTINCT EPITOPES OF HUMAN P53 PROTEINS; 2) TO ISOLATE THE AUTHENTIC HUMAN P53 PROTEINS; 3) TO CHARACTERIZE THE EPITOPES RECOGNIZED BY HUMAN P53-SPECIFIC MABS; AND 4) TO DEVELOP SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC IMMUNOASSAYS FOR P53-RELATED CANCER DIAGNOSIS. THE KNOWLEDGE DERIVED AND THE TEST(S) DEVELOPED FROM THESE MABS WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR PHASE II CLINICAL APPLICATIONS SUCH AS PROSPECTIVE OR PROGNOSTIC STUDIES.",

HOWEVER, FEW DEMONSTRATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED OFACTUAL OPERATING SYSTEMS DUE TO THE UNAVAILABILITY OF AN \"IDEAL\" OPTICAL NEURON HAVING OPTIC GAINCASCADABILITY, HIGH ON/OFF CONTRAST, APPROPRIATE TWO-DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY AND NXN PIXEL DENSITIES, ADEQUATE SWITCHING SPEEDS, AND TOLERABLE SWITCHING POWER REQUIREMENTS. CLEARLY, ARCHITECTURE DESIGN HAS OUTPACED DEVICE DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS PROPOSAL WE DESCRIBE A REVOLUTIONARY NEWDEVICE WHICH WILL MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS. THE DEVICE WHICH IS APTLY CALLED AN \"OPTICAL NEURON\" CONSISTS OF A VERTICAL-CAVITY SURFACE-EMITTING LASER MONOLITHICALLY INTEGRATED WITH A PHOTOTRANSISTOR. THESE MONOLITHICALLY INTEGRATED DEVICES WILL BE CASCADABLE AND WILL HAVE HIGH OPTICAL GAIN (THUS THE ABILITY TO BE MASSIVELY INTERCONNECTED). THEY WILL BE FABRICATED USING SIMPLE PLANAR VLSI TECHNOLOGY AND EMIT LIGHT PERPENDICULAR TO THE SURFACE. CONSEQUENTLY THEY ARE IDEALLY SUITED TO OPTICAL FOURIER TRANSFORMATIONS USING ONLY LENSES. THE PHASE I PROJECT WILL (1) DEMONSTRATE AN OPTICAL NEURON ON ACHIP, (2) DESIGN A OPTIMIZED SECOND GENERATION DEVICE, (3) IDENTIFY A NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE BASED ON THE OPTICAL NEURONS, AND (4) OUTLINE PHASE-II. PHASE II SHOULD INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF, FOR EXAMPLE, A NEURAL OPTICAL COMPUTER OR A NEURAL NETWORK FOR PERFORMING PATTERN RECOGNITION.",

THE CLOCK SPEEDS OF ALL-ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS ARE TWO TO THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE SLOWER THAN THE SPEED CAPABILITIES OF THE ELECTRONIC LOGIC DEVICES ON THE CHIPS DUE TO FUNDAMENTAL CONSTRAINTS IN IMPEDANCE MATCHING AND THE VON NEWMANN BOTTLENECK. WE PROPOSE TO OVERCOME THESE SPEED LIMITATIONS BY USING OPTOELECTRONIC INTERCONNECTS. OF THE MANY OPTOELECTRONIC DEVICES AVAILABLE, (E.G. SPATIAL-LIGHT MODULATORS, LEDS, EDGE-EMITTING SEMICONDUCTOR LASERS, ETC.) THE VERTICAL-CAVITY SURFACE-EMITTING LASER PROVIDES AN INTERCONNECTION CAPABILITY HAVING THE BEST SPEED, POWER, RELIABILITY, AND EASE OF IMPLEMENTATION. FURTHERMORE MONOLITHIC VERTICAL INTEGRATION OF THE MICROLASER WITH ITS DRIVER REDUCES TO NEARLY ZERO THE LENGTH OVER WHICH HIGH-SPEED, RELATIVELY HIGH-POWER SIGNALS MUST PROPAGATE. IN THIS PROGRAM WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED STRUCTURE WITH SPECIFIC REGIONS SERVING AS RECEIVERS WHILE OTHERS FUNCTION AS TRANSMITTERS AND DESIGN A PROCESSOR BASED ON THIS INTERCONNECTION SCHEME. OUR PROPOSED PROCESSOR WILL INITIALLY CONSIST OF A MULTIPLICITY OF VERTICALLY (THREE-DIMENSIONAL) STACKED PLANES. EACH PLANE WILL BE COMPRISED OF GAAS ELECTRONIC LOGIC AND OPTOELECTRONIC INTERPLANE INTERCONNECTS CONSISTING OF SURFACE-EMITTING LASER TRANSMITTERS AND HIGH-SPEED PHOTOTRANSISTORS AS RECEIVERS. THIS WILL SET THE STAGE FOR DESIGNING NEW CHIPS OPTIMIZED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INCREASED SPEED OF THESE INTERCONNECTS AND FOR IMPLEMENTING A HIGH-SPEED THREE-DIMENSIONAL OPTOELECTRONIC SIGNAL PROCESSOR.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA GENERATED IN HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS EXPERIMENTS NECESSITATES DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES CAPABLE OF HANDLING VERY HIGH DATA RATES. OPTICAL TECHNIQUES FOR DATA TRANSMISSION AND FOR NETWORKING ARE DESIRABLE BECAUSE OF THEIR LARGE BANDWIDTH, HIGH SPEED, LOW LOSS, AND RESISTANCE TO ELECTROMAGNETIC NOISE. ONE OF THE DRAWBACKS OF OPTICAL NETWORKS IS THE LACK OF LARGE-SCALE PHOTONIC SWITCHING ARRAYS, ANALOGOUS TO THE VERY LARGE-SCALE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CROSSBARS IN ELECTRONIC PROCESSING. MANY OPTICAL CROSSBAR SWITCH TECHNIQUES PASSIVELY SPLIT AND COMBINE THE OPTICAL BEAMS, WITH ACTIVE MODULATION PERFORMED BY A SPATIAL LIGHT MODULATOR. THESE SWITCHES HAVE SIGNIFICANT POWER BUDGET PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF THE FAN-OUT AND FAN-IN LOSS, AND THEREFORE CAN HANDLE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF CHANNELS. FOR THIS REASON, OPTICAL FIBER NETWORKS SHOULD HAVE NONBLOCKING SWITCHES THAT TRANSFER THE ENTIRE SIGNAL INTO THE SELECTED CHANNEL. THIS PROJECT PLANS TO DEVELOP A LARGE-SCALE PHOTONIC SWITCHING ARRAY FOR HIGH DATA RATE FIBER OPTIC NETWORKS OR COMPUTER INTERCONNECTS. THE SWITCH IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF MATRIX VECTOR MULTIPLICATION. IN THE PLANNED APPROACH, HOWEVER, THE FUNCTION OF BEAM SPLITTING AND COMBINING IS EMBEDDED IN THE FUNCTION OF THE SWITCH ITSELF.

THIS PROJECT STUDIES THE USE OF FLUORESCENT PLASTIC OPTICAL FIBERS TO MONITOR LIGHT LEAKAGE OF THE LASER DELIVERY FIBERS. THE FLUORESCENT FIBERS RUN ADJACENT TO THE LASER POWER DELIVERY FIBERS, WITHIN THE POWER DELIVERY FIBER CABLE. PROPER SELECTION OF ORGANIC DYE ALLOWS THE PLASTIC OPTICAL FIBER TO FLUORESCE WHEN EXPOSED TO LASER LIGHT LEAKED OUT OF LASER DELIVERY FIBERS THAT HAVE BEEN DAMAGED OR BENT. BENDING FIBERS CAN BE USED AS AN OPTICAL POWER MEASUREMENT. THE FLUORESCENT SIGNAL WILL BE GUIDED BY THE PLASTIC OPTICAL FIBER TO A PHOTODETECTOR ARRAY AND DISPLAY PANEL. IN THE STEADY-STATE CONDITION, THE PHOTODETECTORS WILL RECEIVE VERY LITTLE LIGHT. DAMAGE TO ONE OF THE LASER DELIVERY FIBERS WILL CAUSE A FLUORESCENT SIGNAL TO BE SENT TO THE PHOTODETECTOR ARRAY, AND AN ALARM WILL BE ACTIVATED. A VERY SIMPLE SCHEME WILL ALLOW THE LOCATION OF THE PROBLEM IN THE POWER FIBER TO BE DETERMINED WITHIN A FEW FEET. THIS APPROACH TO FIBER OPTIC LASER DELIVERY MONITORING CAN ALSO SERVE AS AN OPTICAL POWER METER BY INCORPORATING A TEMPORARY CALIBRATED BEND INTO THE LASER DELIVERY FIBER.

The biggest problem with conventional modulator designs is the lack of a \"perfect\" electrooptic material, one having both a large index modulation (Delta n) and a very high bandwidth. We are currently investigating a novel waveguide grating coupler modulator structure concept which goes around this problem. This modulator is based on electrooptically varying the phase-matching coupling condition, which is very stringent, so that a very small change in the refractive index determines whether or not the unguided free space beam is coupled into the fundamental waveguide mode.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes a drastically new ion-doped graded index (GRIN) polymer waveguide laser. Due to the GRIN property, such a waveguide laser can be fabricated on any substrate of interest. The existence of ion-doped waveguide lasers on various amorphous glass substrates and single crystal LiNbO3 implies that metastable states do exist for an array of host microstructures. The O-H-group quenchers, which jeopardize the lifetime of metastable states, can be eliminated through the dehydration process after the ions, such as Er+++ and Nd+++, have been implemented. Single-mode waveguides provide better gain due to their high optical energy confinement. A stable waveguide resonator is provided by recording a narrow-band holographic rejection filter which also functions as the single longitudinal-mode selector. Longitudinal pumping significantly reduces the size and therfore the cost of the microlaser array. Long interaction length of longitudinal pumping ensures a high absorption rate of the photons generated from the semiconductor pumping laser. Finally, the problem of excited state absorption (ESA) can be eliminated by detuning the pumping wavelength away from the center of the ground-state absorption feature. The feasibility of the proposed Er+++ and Nd+++-doped GRIN polymer waveguide lasers will be demonstrated in Phase I.",

UNCONVENTIONAL EDDY CURRENT INDUCTION METHODS EXCITE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS IN THE PARTS, AND DETECTION IS ACCOMPLISHED WITH A MAGNETO-OPTIC SENSOR, PRODUCING DIRECT, REAL-TIME IMAGING OF DEFECTS. THE MAGNETO-OPTIC SENSOR RESPONS TO SMALL STATIC OR TIME VARYING MAGNETIC FIELDS NORMAL TO THE INSPECTION SURFACE. THESE FIELDS ARE PRODUCED WHEN CRACKS OR OTHER DEFECTS, INCLUDING CORRODED AREAS, INTERACT WITH THE INDUCED ELECTRIC CURRENTS. THEMAGNETOOPTIC SENSOR RESPONDS TO FREQUENCIES FROM 0 (DC) TO OVER 250 KHZ. THE LOWER FREQUENCIES (0 TO ABOUT 10 KHZ) SHOULD BE USEFUL FOR IMAGING AND DETECTION OF SUBSURFACE CRACKS AND CORROSION, AND THE HIGHER FREQUENCIES (10 KHZ TO OVER 200 KHZ) FOR DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SURFACE CRACKS. DIRECT OBSERVATION OF THE MAGNETO-OPTIC SENSOR, USING POLARIZED LIGHT AND AN ANALYZER, REVEALS REAL-TIME IMAGES OF DEFECTS. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY OFFERS THE ADVANTAGES OF VERY RAPID COVERAGE OF LARGE AREAS, HIGHER SENSITIVITY TO SMALL CRACKS, MORE DIRECT DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF DEFECTS, AND SIMPLE, INEXPENSIVE RECORDING OF THE ENTIRE INSPECTION.",

THESE HIGH SAMPLING RATES MANDATE THE USE OF VERY HIGH SPEED ARCHITECTURES OBTAINED VIA EXPENSIVE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS HETEROJUNCTION BIPOLAR TRANSISTORS (HBTS). ANALOG TO DIGITAL (A/D) CONVERTERS THAT ARE KNOWN TO WORK AT THE HIGHEST SPEED TYPICALLY INVOLVE A STRAIGHT FLASH ARCHITECTURE, PRECEDED BY A DIODE-BRIDGE SAMPLE AND HOLD (S/H) CIRCUIT. HOWEVER, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN SINGLE-CHIP IMPLEMENTATIONS FOR CONVERTERS WITH RESOLUTION GREATER THAN 8 BITS BECAUSE THESE TOPOLOGIES INVOLVE A LARGE DEVICE COUNT AND LARGE POWER DISSIPATION. FURTHERMORE, MULTI-CHIP REALIZATIONS YIELD DEGRADED PERFORMANCE AND INCREASED POWER DISSIPATION COMPARED TO MONOLITHIC APPROACHES, DUE TO OVERHEAD INCURRED WHEN DRIVING SIGNALS BETWEEN CHIPS.

Piezoelectric transducers, synchronized with the framing rate of the array, move the interferometer mirrors to change the transmission wavelength. This capability allows for rapid and adaptive changes in sensor bandpass and wavelength selection. Full spectral coverage from 1.35 um to the LWIR is provided at a possbile spectral resolution of 2% of the transmission wavelength. The concept offers spectral resolution and sensivity comparable to IR circular variable filter based systems, with the advantages of great mechanical simplicity and ruggedness, a common optical train and pixel registration at all wavelengths, higher spectral fidelity, and high framing rates.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Although there have been many advances in optics for low energy x-rays, (<=20keV), all optics for x-rays suffer from combinations of small effective apertures, excessively long goal lengths, small bandwidth, or the inability to bend the x-rays through large angles. Physitron proposes to design, fabricate and test x-ray bending, focusing and collimating optics which will have large effective apertures, short focal lengths in focusing systems, large transmission bandwidths,and the ability to bend even 8-10 keV x-rays through large angles with high transmission efficiency. These optics will be fabricated from laminar microchannel sheets stacked to form the large aperture. Microchannel of this type have been made possible by recent Physitron work in neutron optics. Microchannel optics of this type are distinct from those using capillary fibers because they allow better control of x-ray transmission, larger apertures, and much easier fabrication. These optics will have applications in x-ray lasers and other high energy-directed energy systems, x-ray lithographic systems, and underground nuclear testing, aboveground nuclear testing, synchron radiation sources, plasma diagnostics for fusion, materials science applications, and uses in scientific instruments such as x-ray diffractometry and x-ray spectrometry.",

Using this exciting new solid state technology, it appears possible to create ultra-fast response, high force, miniature actuation devices that will have minimum power consumption, are suitable for a variety of high-tech defense and commercial applications, and represent the ultimate in simplicity with essentially no moving parts. Microsecond response times and highly precise displacements from tenths of microns up to one millimeter are thought possible with the proper mechanical implementation and electronics.

The proposed approach io to provide a near optomal yet robust processing algorithm to merge navigation inputs from various sources, primarily an inertial navigation system and Doppler and/or correlation velocity sensing molar, but optionally other velocity or position references.

        "abstract": "Abstract         WHILE ACTIVATED CARBON IS A COMMONLY USED SORBENT FOR CHEMICAL WARFARE (CW) AGENTS, IT HAS TWO DISADVANTAGES: (L) ITS PERFORMANCE IS DEGRADED BY EXPOSURE TO WATER, AND (2) IT BINDS BUT DOES NOT DESTROY THE CW AGENT. A NEW FORM OF CARBON (C60, CALLED BUCKMINSTERFULLERENE) HAS RECENTLY (LATE 1990) BEEN CHARACTERIZED, AND THIS HAS LED TO A PERIOD OF INTENSE INVESTIGATION INTO THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THIS MATERIAL. TDA RESEARCH HAS AN ONGOING RESEARCH EFFORT IN THE PREPARATION AND PROPERTIES OF C60, AND IS DEVELOPING A ROUTE TO THE MATERIAL WITH THE POTENTIAL TO SHARPLY REDUCE COSTS. AVAILABLE DATA SUGGEST THAT C60 SHOULD BE AN EFFECTIVE SORBENT FOR CW AGENTS, AND THAT ITS PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTED BY WATER. IN PHASE I WORK TDA RESEARCH WILL DETERMINE THE ADSORPTIVE CAPACITY OF C60 BY MEASURING ADSORPTION ISOTHERMS FOR C60 WITH SIMULANTS FOR CW AGENTS. A HIGH SURFACE AREA MATERIAL CONTAINING C60 WILL BE PREPARED BY INTRODUCING C60 ONTO AN ACTIVATED CARBON. TO TEST THE ABILITY OF THIS MODIFIED ACTIVATED CARBON AS A FILTER MATERIAL, WE WILL PASS A GAS STREAM CONTAINING SIMULANTS FOR CW AGENTS THROUGH IT AND MEASURE BREAKTHROUGH CURVES. THE MODIFIED ACTIVATED CARBON WILL BE EVALUATED WITH RESPECT TO ITS SORPTIVE PROPERTIES AND RESISTANCE TO DEGRADATION BY WATER, COMPARED WITH UNMODIFIED MATERIAL. GRAPHITIC CARBON IS ALSO WELL KNOWN AS A CATALYST SUPPORT, AND WE BELIEVE THAT C60 WILL HAVE UNIQUE ADVANTAGES IN THIS AREA. IF PHASE I WORK DEMONSTRATES THAT C60 HAS POTENTIAL TO EFFECTIVELY ADSORB CW AGENTS, PHASE II RESEARCH WILL PREPARE AND TEST MATERIALS USING THIS SORBENT, AND WILL ALSO PREPARE TRANSITION METAL DERIVATIVES OF C60 AND EVALUATE THEIR POTENTIAL TO DESTROY CW AGENTS BY CATALYZING OXIDATION AT AMBIENT OR ELEVATED TEMPERATURES. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO IDENTIFY NEW MATERIALS WHICH ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AT ADSORBING AND DESTROYING CHEMICAL AGENTS.",

THESE MATERIALS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED EXTENSIVELY OVER THE LAST DECADE, AND THEY ARE MOVING TOWARD SUBSTANTIAL COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS. AN OPPORTUNITY TO PREPARE NOVEL LDMMS WITH IMPROVED PROPERTIES NOW ARISES WITH THE RECENT DISCOVERY OF FULLERENE CARBON. FULLERENES ARE PARTICULARLY SUITED AS BUILDING BLOCKS OF LDMMS BECAUSE OF THEIR LOW DENSITY, INHERENT STIFFNESS, THERMAL STABILITY, AND TENDENCY TO REACT AT MULTIPLE SITES (WHICH FAVORS CROSS-LINKING REACTIONS). A VERY PROMISING SYNTHETIC ROUTE TO FULLERENE LDMMS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED. IN PHASE I, BY COMBINING REACTIONS THAT YIELD ORGANIC LDMMS WITH RECENTLY REPORTED REACTIONS OF FULLERENES, POROUS, MONOLITHIC SOLIDS CONTAINING FULLERENES ARE BEING PREPARED. THE PRODUCTS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY DETERMINING SPECIFIC SURFACE AREA, POROSITY, CELL SIZE DISTRIBUTION, AND COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH AND MODULUS. ADSORPTION AND DESORPTION WILL THEN BE MEASURED FOR SELECTED ADSORBATES; THIS INFORMATION WILL BE COMBINED WITH DATA FROM A CURRENT PROJECT THAT IS STUDYING ADSORPTION ON FULLERENES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND SORPTION ON THE NEW LDMMS. PHASE I IS ALSO CONSIDERING POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF THE NEW MATERIALS AS WELL AS THE STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES REQUIRED FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE. OTHER FORMS OF CARBON CURRENTLY HAVE IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS ACTIVATED CARBON IN ADSORPTION AND VITREOUS CARBON AS ELECTRODE MATERIALS. FULLERENE CARBON CAN NOW BE PREPARED IN A FORM SUITABLE FOR SIMILAR USES, WITH A GREATER DEGREE OF SYNTHETIC CONTROL BEING EXERCISED OVER STRUCTURE THAN IS POSSIBLE WITH OTHER FORMS OF CARBON.

THIS MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE IS CONSTRAINING THE DESIGN OF FUTURE AIRCRAFT AND THEIR WEAPON SYSTEMS. ADVANCED FUEL CHEMISTRY MAY ALLOW OPERATION TEMPERATURES UP TO 900OF (483OC) WHICH IS ABOVE THE CRITICAL POINT OF MOST HYDROCARBONS. CONSEQUENTLY, CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT HEAT EXCHANGER DESIGNS MAY NOT BE ACCEPTABLE AT THE HIGH TEMPERATURE, PRESSURE AND HIGHLY VARIABLE HEAT TRANSFER PROPERTIES OF THE SUPERCRITICAL FUEL.

THE SPECIFIC AIM IS TO DEVELOP A COLLAGEN MEMBRANE FOR PERIODONTAL USE WITH A RESORPTION TIME OF ABOUT TWELVE WEEKS AND NEGLIGIBLE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE. A NONINFLAMMATORY LONG RESORPTION TIME COLLAGEN WOULD ALSO FIND APPLICATION IN ORTHOPEDICS, BREAST IMPLANTATION, CONTROLLED DRUG DELIVERY, SURGICAL PROCEDURES REQUIRING RESORBABLE HEMOSTATS, SUTURES, ETC., AND RELATED FIELDS. CROSS-LINKING COLLAGEN WITH GLUTARALDEHYDE INCREASES RESORPTION TIME, BUT THE CROSS-LINKED PRODUCT ALSO CAUSES INFLAMMATION. CONJUGATION WITH ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE, HOWEVER, INCREASES RESORPTION TIME WITHOUT CAUSING INFLAMMATION. ELECTRON MICROSCOPY SHOWS THAT THE ENZYME CONJUGATION PRODUCES A SMOOTHER, MORE REGULAR AND ORGANIZED SURFACE. ENZYME CONJUGATION ALSO INCREASED WATER SORPTION, WHILE CROSS-LINKING DECREASED IT. THE FOLLOWING TESTS WILL BE CARRIED OUT ON DISCS MADE OF FOUR TYPES OF COLLAGEN: UNTREATED, CROSS-LINKED, ENZYME-CONJUGATED, AND CROSS-LINKED ENZYME-CONJUGATED. 1) WATER SORPTION. 2) RESIDUAL ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE ACTIVITY. 3) DEGRADATION WITH COLLAGENASE (AS AN INDICATION OF EVENTUAL RESORPTION). 4) MEASUREMENTS OF MEMBRANE THICKNESS AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES. 5) HISTOPATHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE TISSUES SURROUNDING SUBCUTANEOUS IMPLANTS OF THE DISCS IN MICE, REMOVED PERIODICALLY FOR INFLAMMATION LEVELS AND RESIDUAL COLLAGEN.",

CONSEQUENTLY, IAM SURFACES ARE ALSO USEFUL AT PREDICTING SOLUTE AND/OR DRUG TRANSPORT ACROSS BIOLOGICAL BARRIERS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF PHASE I STUDIES ARE: (1) TO PREPARE A WIDE PORE (1000 ANGSTROMS) VERSIONS OF THE COMMERCIAL IAM.PC FOR IMPROVED MASS-TRANSFER OF LARGE MOLECULES; AND (2) TO TRANSFER THE RECENT TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED BY DR. PIDGEON TO REGIS AND COMMERCIALIZE TWO NEW IAM PACKINGS; THE IAM.PC SURFACE END-CAPPED WITH ALKYLANHYDRIDES, WHICH STERICALLY PROTECT THE SILICA SURFACE FROM SOLVOLYSIS; AND AN IAM SURFACE CONTAINING A SINGLE ETHER-LINKED PHOSPHOLIPID.

Additionally, RTA will extend the -^: theoretical connection between traditional signal processing and the new, nonlinear techniques. RTA will adapt currently operational, proprietary NLD-based software m6Sules to provide a demonstration of these concepts for this effort. In a planned Phase II follow-on effort, the NLD-based techniques identified in this Phase I effort will be refined and implemented on RTA's MicroVAX systems.

Innovations required to meet this objective are: (1) 1100 W/mK K1100X graphite fiber, (2) unique weaving techniques that will provide a nearly unidirectinal preform with adequate mechnical strength for handling and launch loads, and (3)careful impregnation of pitch A240 into the preform, possibly supplemented with CVD. The matrix should orient itself to the graphite fibers with an apparent growth of the fiber diameter. Maximum density is vital with a goal of 1.85 g/cc.

This technology, which will enable the development of materials for optical storage and data retrieval methods without cross-talk between channels, is based on the cholesteric liquid crystal polymer property of selective reflection at a characteristic wavelength. Each layer in a multi-CLC-layer storage medium has a differnt characteristic wavelength, making it possible to randomly select any layer for reading and writing. It is projected that a 16 T-Byte erasable mass storage system with a data rate of 1.6 T-Bit/sec can be built using Reveo's breakthrough technology.

        "abstract": "Abstract         RECENT ADVANCES IN DIFFRACTIVE (OR BINARY) OPTICS TECHNOLOGYDEMONSTRATE THAT DIFFRACTIVE OPTICS CAN PROVIDE REVOLUTIONARY SOLUTIONS THAT SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE PERFORMANCE OF MANY OPTICAL SYSTEMS. SURFACE-RELIEF DIFFRACTIVE LENSES PROVIDE A NEW MEANS TO IMPROVE OPTICAL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE, WHETHER BY CORRECTING GEOMETRICAL ABERRATIONS, CHROMATIC ABERRATIONS, OR REDUCING THERMAL SENSITIVITY. SINCE PRECISION LENS SYSTEMS BASED ON DIFFRACTIVE OPTICS CAN CONSIST OF FEWER OPTICAL ELEMENTS THAN EQUIVALENT CONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS, THEY CAN BE LIGHTWEIGHT AND COST SIGNIFICANTLY LESS TO MANUFACTURE. SEVERAL METHODS ARE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SURFACE-RELIEF DIFFRACTIVE OPTICS INCLUDING SINGLE-POINT DIAMOND TURNING AND PHOTOLITHOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES. BOTH OF THESE METHODS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT, LARGE NUMBERS OF PROCESSING STEPS, AND RELATIVELY LONG FABRICATION CYCLES. BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFRACTIVE OPTICS IN PRESENT AND FUTURE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL HARDWARE, EFFICIENT INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS MUST BE CREATED. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AN ADVANCED MANUFACTURING SYSTEM BASED ON A HIGH-PRECISION LASER WRITING MACHINE FOR THE DIRECT GENERATION OF ROTATIONALLY-SYMMETRIC DIFFRACTIVE OPTICS WITHCONTINUOUS PROFILES IN PHOTOPOLYMERS. THIS MACHINE WILL SERVE AS THE CORNERSTONE TO COMBINE ADVANCED COMPUTER-AIDED OPTICAL DESIGN AND AUTOMATED PROCESS CONTROL OF THE MANUFACTURING STATION. THE INTEGRATION OF OPTICAL DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS CONTROL WILL REDUCE COST AND CYCLETIME OF HIGH-QUALITY DIFFRACTIVE OPTICS. SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED MANUFACTURING SYSTEM WILL OFFER A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LONG-TERM COMMERCIALIZATION OF DIFFRACTIVE OPTICS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A single-point laserwriting system for the fabrication of multi-phase level surface-relief diffractive optics will be designed and analyzed. The instrument will be designed to generate diffractive structures in photoresist. The minimum feature size obtained from such an instrument directly influences the maximum diffraction angle, wavefront performance, and diffraction efficiency of the resulting optical element. The overall performance of the optical element is a strong function of the instrument accuracy. In the Phase I research and development effort, a user interface and the associated software routines for developing generalized phase structures will be developed. Optical elements of interest include diffractive lenses and interconnect distributions for optical processing applications. Compared to electron-beam or vlsi-lithographic methods, a laser offers the potential for small feature sizes at reasonable cost. Direct writing on the substrate will allow the optic to be manufactured at one station. The goal of the SBIR Phase II development effort is to construct and evaluate an integrated workstation for the fabrication of a wide range of diffractive components.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Miniature adsorption refrigeration systems capable of cooling as low as -60 degrees Fahrenheit without fans for heat rejection are being developed. When used with computers and electronics packages, advantages include 40% higher processing speed with key chips operating at low temperature, better reliability with hermitically sealed chassis and no hot spots, and low noise by elimination of fans. Other applications include a microwave-oven-sized consumer quick-freeze appliance, portable freezers, and boat and RV refrigerators. Because solid adsorbents are used, the refrigeration systems require no moving parts except on valve, giving high reliability. Complex compound adsorbents provide high cooling power per unit mass, high efficiency, and low cooling temperatures. They perform where thermoelectrics and vapor compression cannot. Manufacturing cost is estimated at less than $40 for 50W of cooling at -40 degrees Fahrenheit. Sorbers specifically optimized for a miniature electronics cooling device will be developed in Phase I. A complete operating prototype will be built in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Sarcos is currently developing a technology that can lead to low-cost millimeter-scale gyroscopes, multi axis inertial sensors, and very compact laser scanning devices. This technology, called Micro Disk Systems (MDS), is based on levitating a small disk above a VLSI substrate using electrostatic fields. AC stabilization of the fields ensures that the disk position remains suitable, and field-based sensors measure the spatial position of the disk. In a previous contract, we constructed a proof of principle prototype and demonstrated the feasibility of MDS technology. In Phase I, we will design an evaluation system that will address two immediate applications of this technology: 1)inertial sensors (a few millimeters on a side) that determine acceleration magnitude and direction, and 2) a very small laser scanner which can steer an incoming beam. Phase II will focus on construction and testing of the evaluation system, and Phase III will emphasize commercial development.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Diamond exhibits physical properties that make it an ideal material from which to construct electronic devices for high temperature, high frequency and/or high radiation applications. A major obstacle to the mass production of diamond electronics is the lack of a method for growing large area single crystal thin films of diamond on other materials. All reliable high deposition rate diamond growth techniques to date require elevated temperatures, severely limiting the choice of substrate materials. Schmidt will explore the use of seeded supersonic beams to deposit diamond heteroepitaxially on silicon. The kinetic energy imparted to feedstock gas molecules via supersonic expansion in a lighter carrier gas can be accurately controlled and will serve to activate the feedstock during surface-molecule collisions while the substrate remains at ambient temperature. Several variations of this scheme that will vary total energy delivered to the growth surface and concentration of molecular hydrogen will also be explored.",

AS PART OF THE PHASE I EFFORT, THE NEAR-IR OUTPUT OF A PULSED TI:SAPPHIRE LASER WILL BE CONVERTED TO THE 205-225 NM REGION VIA FREQUENCY QUADRUPLING IN TWO BETA-BARIUM BORATE CRYSTALS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE QUALITY OF THE CORNEAL INCISIONS MADE USING WAVELENGTHS RANGING FROM 205-225 NM COMPARE FAVORABLY WITH THOSE MADE BY THE 193 NM EXCIMER. IF A WAVELENGTH WITHIN THIS RANGE DOES PROVE TO BE USEFUL FOR CORNEAL ABLATION, THE LONG TERM GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE TO DEVELOP A CLINICALLY QUALIFIED SOLID-STATE LASER FOR REFRACTIVE SURGERY.",

Performance of present inductive thrusters is hindered by the lack of reliable, efficient pulsed-power technology. Science Research Laboratory has developed novel all-solid-state pulsed drivers that have greater than 10(E)11 shot life and can operate at repetition rates of 10(3 pps and higher. The pulsed drivers can generate the pulse waveform required for rapid gas breakdown, efficient plasma acceleration, and recovery of the reflected electrical energy. This new driver technology will lead to a 100-1000 times increase in thruster total impulse, a factor of 10 reduction in specific weight, and more than 50% increase in energy efficiency. Successful development of the all-solid-state inductive thruster will result in a thruster technology that is lightweight, efficient, capable of achieving 10(E)8 - 10(E)9 N-sec total impulse, and scalable to megawatt average power levels.",

BY SUMMING SIGNALS FROM A LASER OPERATING AT 10 HZ RATE FOR 10 SECONDS, AN ADDITIONAL FACTOR OF 10 IN SENSITIVITY CAN BE OBTAINED, DROPPING THE MINIMUM DETECTABLE VAPOR CONCENTRATION TO THE 1-10 PPT LEVEL. A PORTABLE LIC SYSTEM COULD THUS EXTEND REAL-TIME DETECTION CAPABILITIES TO LESS VOLATILE EXPLOSIVES SUCH AS TNT. BY USING PRECONCENTRATION TECHNIQUES, OR LASER DESORPTION FROM SURFACES, EVEN LOW VAPOR PRESSURE EXPLOSIVES SUCH AS RDX COULD BE DETECTED.",

SUCH THREATS RANGE FROM ENEMY GENERATED NUCLEAR EMP AND HPMS TO FRIENDLY RADAR AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM RF RADIATIONS. WHILE THESE THREATS HAVE BEEN INCREASING IN POWER AND FREQUENCY, THE FUZES USED IN MODERN WEAPONS HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY BASED ON SENSITIVE ELECTRONICS, SUCH AS INTEGRATED CIRCUITS FOR TIMING, RADAR ALTITUDE SENSORS, AND PROXIMITY FUZES. THESE SENSORS, IN CONJUNCATION WITH THEIR ELECTRONIC DETONATORS, MAY BE ACTIVATED BY THE VARIOUS ELECTROMAGNETIC THREATS. THE ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THIS SBIR PROGRAM WILL BE: 1WHAT LEVEL OF HARDENING IS DESIRED BY THE ARMY FROM THE AMMUNITION CONTAINERS? THIS GIVES GUIDANCE IN THE DETERMINATION OF WHAT TYPE OF MEASURES NEED TO BE TAKEN IN MODIFYING THE CONTAINERS. 2WHAT IS THE PRESENT SHIELDING EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PRESENT AMMUNITION CASES? IF SOME TYPES OF PRESENT CASES OFFER SIGNIFICANT SHIELDING, THERE MAY NOT BE ANY NEED FOR MODIFYING SUCH CASES. SIMILARITY, KNOWING THE PRESENT SHIELDING EFFECTIVENESS OF PRESENT CASES WILL AID IN IDENTIFYING HARDENING MODIFICATIONS. 3WHAT TYPE OF MODIFICATIONS CAN BE MADE TO THE CONTAINERS?

ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TASK IS TEMPORAL PROCESSING IN WHICH THE TARGET MOVEMENT RELATIVE TO BOTH BACKGROUND AND FOREGROUND CLUTTER IS USED TO ENHANCE DETECTION PROBABILITY. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE PRESENT AN INTEGRATED AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO YIELD SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE TO CURRENT TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS MTI. CURRENT ALGORITHMS TEND TO BE AD HOC, CONSISTING OF A CASCADE OF PROCESSORS WHICH MAY WORK AT CROSS PURPOSES. A MORE SUITABLE APPROACH WOULD BE TO COMBINE MOTION DETECTION AND CLUTTER REDUCTION IN A SINGLE STEP. WE PROPOSE A PROBABILISTIC FRAMEWORK IN WHICH THE IMAGE IS MODELED AS A RANDOM FIELD TO BE ESTIMATED IN REAL TIME FROM NOISY AMBIGUOUS MEASUREMENTS FROM MULTIPLE SENSORS. A BAYESIAN VIEWPOINT S ADOPTED, IN WHICH THE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE IS EXPRESSED AS A PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTI ON. USING A PROBABLISTICS DESCRIPTION OF THE OBSERVATION NOISE, THE POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION OF THE RANDOM FIELD CAN BE COMPUTED. THESE MODELS ARE BASED ON MARKOV RANDOM FIELDS AND THE GIBBS DISTRIBUTION. SIGNIFICANTLY, THESE ASSUMPTIONS LEAD TO COOPERATIVE DISTRIBUTION ALGORITHMS WHICH MAY BE IMPLEMENTED ON PARALLEL PROCESSORS. IT IS POSSIBLE TO MODEL BOTH PIECEWISE CONTINUOUS SURFACES AND THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN SMOOTH PATCHES (TARGETS, CLOUDS, OBJECTS, E.G.).

MICE WILL BE IMMUNIZED WITH PURIFIED INFLUENZA VIRUS TYPE A H3N2 (UDORN) FREE IN SOLUTION OR ENCAPSULATED IN BIODEGRADABLE MICROSPHERES, BY ORAL, INTRANASAL, OR SYSTEMATIC ROUTES. THE LEVELS AND ISOTYPE OF THE INDUCED, ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC IMMUNOGLOBULINS WILL BE DETERMINED IN SERA AND SECRETIONS COLLECTED FROM THE IMMUNIZED MICE. THE DATA OBTAINED WILL BE CORRELATED WITH THE FORM BY WHICH THE ANTIGEN WAS DELIVERED (FREE IN THE SOLUTION OR IN MICROSPHERES) AND WITH THE ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION (SYSTEMIC, ORAL, OR INTRANASAL). THESE STUDIES ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE MOST EFFECTIVE ROUTE FOR INDUCTION OF ANTIBODIES WITH A PROTECTIVE ROLE AGAINST INFLUENZA VIRUS INFECTIONS. POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES FOR USING BIOCOMPATIBLE AND BIODEGRADABLE MICROSPHERES AS AN ANTIGEN DELIVERY VEHICLE INCLUDE: PROTECTION AND CONTROLLED RELEASE OF RELATIVELY HIGH AMOUNTS OF ANTIGEN, AN ADJUVANT EFFECT, AND SELECTIVE STIMULATION OF SECRETORY OR SYSTEMIC IMMUNE RESPONSE ACCORDING TO THE SIZE OF MICROSPHERES. AFTER ESTABLISHING THE IMMUNOGENICITY OF MICROENCAPSULATED INFLUENZA VIRUS IN MICE IN PHASE I RESEARCH, THE STUDIES WILL BE CONTINUED IN PHASE II IN ANOTHER ANIMAL MODEL, SQUIRREL MONKEYS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Sensors Unlimited will develop an \"amplifier\" device for near-infrared (1.5-2.1 micron) light signals. \"APDs\" operate by accelerating electrons (generated by incoming light signals) via a high electric field (voltage) and crashing them into the semiconductor crystal, thereby releasing additional electrons which in turn get accelerated and generate even more electrons. This \"avalanche\" or \"multiplication\" effect enables gains of ten or more to be achieved, thus reducing the need for external amplification -- which introduces unwanted electronic noise. This device will be used with LIDAR -- laser radar systems -- and windshear detection systems.",

COMPOSITE APPLICATIONS HAVE RANGED FROM LIMITED AIRCRAFT PARTS TO MUNITION DELIVERY LAUNCH TUBES. THOUGH COMPOSITE MATERIAL CCMPONENTS HAVE A SUCCESSFUL TRACK RECORD IN THE FIELD, PRODUCTION QUANTITY REMAINS LOW. AUTOMATION FOR THE MANUFACTURING AND INSPECTION OF THESE COMPONENTS IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. QUALITY LEVEL FOR COMPOSITE MATERIAL COMPONENTS IS A GROWING CONCERN AMONG THE DEFENSE AND COMMERCIAL INDUSTRY. COMPOSITE MATERIALS ARE INSPECTED IN TWO STAGES, EXTERNALLY AND INTERNALLY. EXTERNAL INSPECTION IS NORMALLY PERFORMED MANUALLY AND THE INTERNAL INSPECTION IS PERFORMED WITH THE AID OF ULTRASONIC TECHNIQUES. BOTH OF THESE METHODS ARE SLOW AND CUMBERSOME. WITH GROWING POPULARITY OF COMPOSITE MATERIAL COMPONENTS, A MORE EFFICIENT AND FASTER INSPECTION STATION IS NEEDED TO PERFORM BOTH OF THE INSPECTION TASKS IN A SINGLE PASS. AS PROPOSED BY SIMPEX, THIS AUTOMIATED COMPOSITE MATERIAL INSPECTION SYSTEM (ACMIS ) USES THE LATEST HIGH SPEED MACHINE VISION AND REAL TIME X-RAY TECHNOLOGIES FOR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL INSPECTION OF COMPOSITE MATERIAL COMPONENTS IN A SINGLE PASS AT A SPEED OF 120 MILLISECONDS PER FIELD OF VIEW. THIS SYSTEM WILL HAVE THE INTELLIGENCE TO LOCATE AND IDENTIFY THE FLAWS WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME. AS AN OPTION, AN IDENTIFICATION SYMBOL WILL BE MARKED ON THE COMPOSITE SURFACE INDICATING THE LOCATION AND TYPE OF THE FLAW BY AN INK JET MARKER AUTOMATICALLY.

Current carbon deposition processes are unacceptably slow and expensive. The new feature of our process is the deposition of iron oxide onto the carbon filters to catalyze the deposition of carbon from methane. Laboratory tests have shown that this unique catalyst doubles the rate of deposition of carbon. Phase I will confirm that the catalytic effect will extend from short term laboratory tests to the deposition of sufficient carbon to form a complete composite material. Phase II will develop optimal process conditions. Applications include: hypersonic flight vehicles, airframe thermal protection materials, rocket nozzles and nosecones, and aircraft brakes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The recent observation of light emission from porous silicon and from germanium nanocrystals in a silicon dioxide matrix has given a great boost to the field of quantum confined structures. It has been suggested that the formation of quantum wires in porous silicon is responsible for the observed emission. The confinement effects in quantum nanocrystals are even more pronounced. In preliminary measurements, SMI has noticed photoluminescence emission (600-900 nm) from silicon Si/SiO2. Ge as smaller effective hole and electron masses and a larger dielectric constant than Si, and as such should exhibit a greater blue shift for a given nanocrystal size. These films may be ideal for the observation and development of confinement effects in germanium quantum nanocrystals. The germanium particles are surrounded by wide bandgap silicon dioxide, which forms an ideal potential barrier. SMI will develop a deposition and processing technology to form, control, and study germanium nanocrystals for luminescence. Later work will investigate electroluminescence by AC excitation.",

This performance has recently been confirmed by a US scientific team. The Russian has flown more than 50 of the SPT thrusters. Recently, this technology is available to the US users. Despite the advancement of the thruster design, Russian electronics are trailing behind the west, especially the American electronic technology. The Russian designed Power Conditioning Unit for the SPT is not likely to meet the US expectations and space hardware qualification. Furthermore, the Russian flight PCU weighs over 30kg, three times the US targeted weight. Space Power Inc will use the rugged MOSFET with fast intrinsic diode, high frequency switching, and proprietary low mass, high efficiency PCU design expertise to develop a PCU for the SPT that will weigh less than 10 kg and has over 90% efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In fogs, accretion of supercooled water drops is responsible for icing of power lines and structures. In clouds, the same process causes icing on aircraft. In both cases the concentration and size of liquid wate drops, along with their velocity relative to the icing surface, primarily determines the shape and mass of the accreted ice. Better measurements of the concentration and size of water drops in fogs and clouds are needed to improve predictions of ice accretion. In Phase I, we do numerical simulations and perform laboratory tests of a new optical instrument for measurieng liquid water content and drop spectra. The new device makes high-resolution measurmentrs of the angular distribution of diffracted light from an 'ensemble' of water drops. Using weighting functions, liquid water content is computed in software. Using inversion techniques, the same set of measurments are then used to compute drop spectra without a priori assumption of the shape of the spectra. The new instruments works without the need to measure air velocity and temperature. In Phase II, we will build a reggedized, microprocessor-based, field version of the instrument that functions without operator intervention.",

DYSFUNCTION OF THERECEPTOR IS INVOLVED IN SEVERAL PATHOLOGICAL STATES INCLUDING ASTHMA, HYPERTENSION, MYOCARDITIS AND DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY. MEASUREMENT OF BETA RECEPOR ACTIVITY RESTS PREDOMINANTLY ON THE BINDING ASSAY, WHICH HAS SEVERAL LIMITATIONS AND IS OF LIMITED CLINICAL UTILITY. THE GOAL IS TO PRODUCE SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES TO THE BETA ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS AND TO DEVELOP IMMUNOASSAYS USING THESE ANTIBODIES. TWO COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES USING PROTEIN CHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY ARE DESCRIBED. IN THE FIRST APPROACH, ANTIGENIC REGIONS OF THE BETA ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR WILL BE IDENTIFIED USING THEORETICAL MODELS, PEPTIDES CORRESPONDING TO THESE SEQUENCES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED, ANTIBODIES PRODUCED IN RABBITS, AND THE ANTIBODIES EVALUATED FOR THE DETECTION OF THE DENATURED AND INTACT FORMS OF THE RECEPTOR. THE SECOND APPROACH INVOLVES EXPRESSING THE RECEPTOR IN E. COLI (AS A SECRETORY PROTEIN AND AS A BETA GALACTOSIDASE FUSION PROTEIN), IN A FORM WHICH RETAINS BINDING ACTIVITY AND PHARMACOLOGIC SPECIFICITY. THE EXPRESSED RECEPTOR WILL BE UTILIZED TO TEST THE ANTIBODIES RAISED WITH SYNTHETIC PEPTIDES, AS A SOURCE OF STANDARDS IN THE IMMUNOASSAYS, AND WILL ALSO SERVEAS THE ANTIGEN IN RAISING A FURTHER PANEL OF ANTIBODIES. SPECIFICITY OF THE ANTIBODIES WILL BE ASSESSED USING MEMBRANES DERIVED FROM DIFFERENT CELLS CONTAINING OR DEVOID OF THE BETA-2 RECEPTOR. FURTHER TESTS OF SPECIFICITY WILL ESTABLISH THE IMMUNOREACTIVE BAND ON WESTERN BLOTS AS BEING THE RECEPTOR BY CARRYING OUT IMMUNOPRECIPITATION OF THE PHOTOLABELED RECEPTOR. ONCE THE VALIDATION OF THE ANTIBODIES IS COMPLETE, A CLINICALLY USEFUL IMMUNOASSAY AS EIA WILL BE FORMULATED. THE ANTIBODIES WILL ALSO BE EVALUATED FOR THEIR UTILITY IN STRUCTURE/FUNCTION STUDIES OFTHE RECEPTOR. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE IS GIVEN WHICH INDICATESTHAT ANTIBODIES TO SOME SYNTHETIC PEPTIDES MAY DETECT BOTH THE NATURAL AND RECOMBINANT RECEPTORS.",

IN PAST ATTEMPTS TO DEVELOP RADIOISOTOPE-POWERED VOLTAIC CELLS (BETA-VOLTAIC CELLS), THE POWER ATTAINED WAS SEVERELY LIMITED BECAUSE OF RADIATION DAMAGE TO THE SILICON SEMICONDUCTOR USED IN THEM. THE RECENTLY DISCOVERED RADIATION DAMAGE RESISTANCE AND ANNEALING PROPERTIES OF INDIUM PHOSPHIDE AND OTHER EMERGING SEMICONDUCTORS REMOVE THIS FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATION AND PERMIT CONSIDERATION OF HIGH ENERGY ALPHA AND BETA EMITTERS. THE PLANNED TECHNOLOGY IS IDEAL FOR APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE SMALL, LOW POWER, DISTRIBUTED PRIMARY BATTERIES. PHASE I FOCUSES ON TESTING AND CONDUCTING PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS OF NEW BATTERY DESIGNS, AS A FUNCTION OF THE AVAILABLE SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS AND ACCELERATOR OR RADIONUCLIDE COMBINATIONS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Spire's program will develop a high energy density, long life power source for space applications such as Brilliant Pebbles and Brilliant Eyes. The essential element of the proposed device consists of a radioisotope powered indium phosphide voltaic cell that can achieve an energy density over ten thousand times greater than that of chemical batteries. In past attempts to develop radioisotope powered voltaic cells, the power attained was severely limited by radiation damage to the silicon semiconductor material used in the cells. This limitation has been removed by the recently discovered radiation damage resistance and annealing properties of indium phosphide. High energy beta and alpha emitters can now achieve high power and long life, and the use of alpha emitters can eliminate external radiation. Spire's voltaic cells represent a power source for remote or inaccessible locations such as space, ocean depths, arctic or mountainous regions, as well as for implantable power sources for cardiac pacemakers, insulin pumps, and ventricular assist devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Diode lasers are great, but not temperature stable. Keeping the frequency constant, essential for communications, requires exotic (read expensive) heavy cooling systems. Investigators at Spire think they have a better way: build a laser diode whose frequency is naturally stable, as in ionic lasers such as neodymium doped YAG. Spire reasons that adding erbium to the quantum well of conventional AlGaAs lasers will stabilize the output at 1548nm, up from the common 800 to 900nm range and well matched to fibers. Spire knows how to make quantum well lasers and offers them as a finished product. Addition of erbium doping is another matter. It requires discovering a source gas compatible with existing metalorganic chemical vapor deposition and learning how to use it. That's what this research program proposes to do.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A capacitor storing a thousand times more energy than is possible today is the carrot offered by this Spire Corporation proposal. To get there, Spire will exploit its ability to grow exotic thin-film dielectric layers by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Everything has to go just right, but if it does, large-area one-micron thick films with kilovolt holdoff will result; that's tens of millions of volts per centimeter! Spire claims MOCVD is eminently practical because, at 2 microns per minute, it will grow metallized, multilayer structures economically whereas other thin-film processes won't. Big weight savings on spaceborne platforms are foreseen. Since the energy stored in Spire-built ultra-capacitors will approach that of electrochemical systems, Spire's capacitors may even supplant batteries as high-power, short-term energy sources in aerospace and all-electric vehicles.",

NIOBIUM-TIN (NB3SN) IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT HIGH FIELD SUPERCONDUCTORS. DEVELOPING ARTIFICIAL FLUX-PINNING CENTERS IN THE SUPERCONDUCTING MATRICES IS ONE OF THE EFFECTIVE APPROACHES (BESIDES ALLOYING NB3SN WITH OTHER ELEMENTS) TO ENHANCE THE CRITICAL CURRENT DENSITY OF NB3SN IN INTERMEDIATE TO HIGH MAGNETIC FIELDS (10-20 T). THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING AN NB3SN MULTIFILAMENTARY SUPERCONDUCTING WIRE WITH ARTIFICIAL COPPER (BRONZE) INCLUSIONS, USING A JELLYROLL AND INTERNAL TIN APPROACH TO ENHANCE THE CRITICAL CURRENT DENSITY IN MAGNETIC FIELDS >10 T. IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT ARTIFICIAL TANTALUM INCLUSIONS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL FLUX PINNING IN THE NB3SN SUPERCONDUCTORS. CU HAS AN EXCELLENT DUCTILITY AND DISPLAYS GOOD COMPATIBILITY WITH NIOBIUM (NB) DURING COLD WORKING. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE USE OF COPPER AS ARTIFICIAL FLUX-PINNING INCLUSIONS WILL IMPROVE THE FABRICABILITY OF THE COMPOSITE WIRE AND REDUCE THE COST. IN PHASE I, A MULTIFILAMENTARY NB/CU COMPOSITE WIRE WITH INTERNAL TIN SOURCES (WHERE EACH SUBELEMENT HAS AN NB/CU JELLYROLL CONFIGURATION) IS BEING FABRICATED WITH CONVENTIONAL WIRE-MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES. TIN (SN) DIFFUSES THROUGH THE COPPER MATRIX AND REACTS WITH NIOBIUM TO FORM NB3SN DURING THE FINAL REACTION HEAT TREATMENT. THE CRITICAL CURRENT DENSITIES OF SUCH A WIRE WILL BE MEASURED AS A FUNCTION OF THE APPLIED MAGNETIC FIELDS AND COMPARED WITH THE PERFORMANCES OF OTHER NB3SN WIRES. THE ALLOYING-ELEMENT ADDITION, OPTIMIZATION, AND SCALE-UP WORK WILL BE CONDUCTED IN THE PHASE II PROGRAM.",

The tellurium source produces ionized species which would increase the dopant incorpration significantly. Very high dopant levels could be achieved with the new sources. The new designs are compatible application to existing MBE systems is possible. The prototype desings will be tested in actual thin film growth to evaluate their effectiveness.

AS CHANGES TO THESE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS ARE INCORPORATED, PARTICULARLY CHANGES TO THE ASSEMBLY CODE EMBEDDED IN HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGES, THE DESIGN DOCUMENTATION IS RARELY UPDATED. REVERSE ENGINEERING PROVIDES THIS SUPPORT FOR THE LIFE-CYCLE MAINTENANCE PROJECT BY PROVIDING AS MUCH HIGH-LEVEL INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE TO BE REPRESENTED IN THE DETAILED DESIGN DOCUMENTATION. RECOGNIZING THE REQUIREMENT FOR FUTURE REVERSE ENGINEERING EFFORTS, SYNETICS WILL PLAN FOR THE FUTURE NOW BY INTEGRATING ALL PHASES OF LARGE REAL-TIME SYSTEM GENERATION INTO ONE ENVIRONMENT. THIS CONCEPT, CALLED SOFTWARE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT PHILOSOPHY (STEP), PROVIDES CONTROL AND CONSISTENCY FOR LCM AND REVERSE ENGINEERING. SYNETICS PROPOSES TO DESIGN AN INNOVATIVE AUTOMATED TOOL TO PERFORM REVERSE ENGINEERING OF ASSEMBLY CODE.

NEURAL NETWORKS OFFER A GREAT DEAL OF PROMISE IN THE GENERAL AREA OF FAULT DETECTION, SINCE THEIR HIGHLY PARALELLIZED STRUCTURE AVOIDS MOST OF THE COMPUTATIONAL DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH A TIME-TAGGED FAULT TREE. IN PARTICULAR, RECENT WORK INDICATES THAT THE MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON ARCHITECTURE CAN GIVE GOOD FDI PERFORMANCE FOR SOME APPLICATIONS. IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NEURAL NETS FOR THE AIRCRAT FDI APPLICATION, IT IS NECESSARY TO FIRST COMPENSATE FOR THE MISSION -DEPENDENT, TIME-VARYING, NON-STATIONARY NATURE OF TYPICAL NAVIGATION ERROR PROCESSES. ALSO, IT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE NEURAL NET INPUTS OVER A LONG ENOUGH TIME HORIZON TO SUCCESSFULLY DIAGNOSE FAULTS, WHILE PRESERVING THE ABILITY TO ELIMINATE THE FAULTY INFORMATION. SYNETICS PROPOSES TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BY PRE-FILTERING THE SENSOR DATA THROUGH A SYNTHETIC MEASUREMENT GENERATOR, BASED ON SYNETICS NET INFORMATION APPROACH (NIA) DISTRIBUTED KALMAN FILTER ALGORITHM.

THE CRUISE MISSILE PLANNER, WITH SOME DIFFICULTY, CAN DETERMINE NEEDED CANDIDATE TERCOM SITES, BUT ALL TOO OFTEN, BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT TERRAIN ROUGHNESS, THE DEFENSE MAPPING AGENCY (DMA) IS UNABLE TO CREATE A TERCOM AT THIS LOCATION. ACCORDING TO DMA, AS MANY AS 90% OF THE TERCOM REQUESTS THEY RECEIVE ARE INFEASIBLE OR REPEAT INFEASIBLE REQUESTS. AS A RESULT, THE PLANNER IS LEFT WITH UNSATISFIED TERCOM NEEDS, AND DMA'S TIME IS WASTED. SCT PROPOSES TO DEVELOP AN INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS PROGRAM WHICH INTEGRATES OUR OPERATIONALLY PROVEN CRUISE MISSILE ROUTING ALGORITHMS WITH DMA-ENDORSED TERCOM SITE VALIDATION CRITERIA. THIS PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE A WINDOW BASED USER INTERFACE WITH GRAPHICAL PLOTS, OPTIMAL PATH COMPUTATIONS, DATA MANAGEMENT OF PAST AND PRESENT TERCOM REQUEST, TERCOM SITE VALIDATION TESTS, REQUEST FORM PRODUCTION, AND MESSAGE HANDLING BETWEEN DMA AND THE JSTPS. THIS NUCLEAR PLANNING TOOL WILL RESULT IN TERCOM REQUESTS BEING SENT TO DMA WHICH ARE NOT ONLY FEASIBLE, BUT WHICH TRULY SATIFY THE CRUISE MISSILE ROUTING NEEDS.",

THIS DESIGN CONCEPT ELIMINATES THE LINE-OF-SIGHT AND ATTENUATION PROBLEMS PRESENT IN THE CURRENT TECHNIQUE OF APPLYING PHOSPHORS TO ENGINE SURFACES AND TRANSMITTING THE EXCITATION AND SIGNAL BEAMS ACROSS FREE SPACE OR THROUGH COMBUSTION GASES. THE SECOND SENSOR VERSION REPLACES THE EXCITATION LIGHT SOURCE AND ITS OPTICS TRAIN WITH A RADIOISOTOPE LOCATED IN THE SENSOR HEAD. BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH HIGH TEMPERATURE MATERIALS AND FIBER OPTIC SENSORS, WE EXPECT TO SHOW THE FEASIBILITY OF OUR APPROACH TO OBTAIN REPRODUCIBLE AND ACCURATE ENGINE TEMPERATURE DATA WITHOUT PERTURBINE FLOWS OR REQUIRING COMPONENT TRENCHING.

RECENTLY, SOME COMMERCIAL SILICON ADCS WITH RESOLUTIONS OF 12 TO 14 BITS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED. MANY OF THESE ARE BASED ON SIGMA-DELTA ARCHITECTURES WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING HIGH RESOLUTION USING ONLY LOW RESOLUTION (IN SOME CASES 1-BIT) FLASH CONVERTERS INTERNALLY, CIRCUMVENTING COMPARATOR OFFSET AND HYSTERESIS, A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IN GAAS CONVERTERS. THUS, THE SIGMA-DELTA TECHNIQUE APPEARS TO BE A PROMISING APPROACH TO THE REALIZATION OF HIGH RESOLUTION, OVERSAMPLED ADCS USING GAAS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF AND TO DEVELOP A DESIGN FOR A 16-BIT ADC OPERATING AT CONVERSION RATES IN EXCESS OF 100 MHZ.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THIS RESEARCH IS FOUNDED ON THE DISCOVERY OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION EMANATING FROM A PULP REFINER AS A RESULT OF ELECTRON TRANSFER PHENOMENA. AN APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING THE REFINING PROCESS BASED ON THIS DISCOVERY HAS BEEN PATENTED; THE APPARATUS CONSISTS OF (1) A BIPOLAR ANTENNA MOUNTED ADJACENT TO THE FRAME OF A REFINER TO DETECT THE ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSES AND (2) ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS TO ANALYZE THE DURATION AND ENERGY OF THESE PULSES. A RECENTLY DESCRIBED IMPROVEMENT ON THE INVENTION DOES NOT RELY ON ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION AND INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER DIFFERENCES, THE MEANS TO DETERMINE THE SIGN OF THE MEASURED VOLTAGES. THE OBSERVED PHENOMENON IS A RESULT OF THE IMPACT OF FIBERS AND FIBER BUNDLES (FLOCS) IN THE REFINER. AS THE FIBERS ARE STRUCTURALLY MODIFIED BY THESE IMPACTS AND AS NEW SURFACES AND PARTICLES ARE CREATED, THE ELECTRICAL DOUBLE LAYER AROUND THE FIBERS AND PARTICLES IS TEMPORARILY DISRUPTED. THIS DISRUPTION IS THE SOURCE OF THE OBSERVED PHENOMENON AND IS A DIRECT MEASURE OF THE NUMBER (N) AND SEVERITY (S) OF THESE IMPACTS. A PREVALENT METHOD OF REFINER CONTROL IS THROUGH SPECIFIC ENERGY DEFINED AS HORSEPOWER DAYS PER TON, HPD/T. THIS CONTROL PARAMETER IS AN APPROXIMATE PREDICTOR OF RESULTANT PULP QUALITY. ANOTHER SPECIFIC ENERGY RELATIONSHIP IS E=NXS. PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO MEASURE BOTH N AND S IN TERMS OF KNOWN PARAMETERS HAVE FAILED. THE RECENTLY DESCRIBED IMPROVEMENT HAS THE ADVANTAGE OVER PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS IN THAT IT MEASURES N AND S BY DISTINCT CLASSES ACCORDING TO A UNIQUE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE OBSERVED SIGNAL AND THUS IS A BETTER PREDICTOR OF PULP QUALITY. THE METHOD PROPOSED IS CONTINUOUS AND NONINTRUSIVE. THE ELECTRONICS ARE SIMPLE AND EASILY MAINTAINED IN THE MILL ENVIRONMENT. IT WOULD PERMIT GREATLY IMPROVED CONTROL, LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY CONSERVATION, PRODUCT QUALITY, AND PRODUCTIVITY, ALL OF WHICH WILL ENHANCE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE PAPER INDUSTRY. PHASE I OF THE PROJECT IS CONSTRUCTING THE NEWLY DISCLOSED CIRCUITS AND DEMONSTRATING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN BOTH THE LABORATORY AND THE PILOT PLANT. INITIAL STUDIES OF THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE OBSERVED SIGNAL AND CURRENT METHODS FOR CHARACTERIZING REFINED PULPS ARE BEING MADE.",

ON THE OTHER HAND, THERMOPHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS MUST OPERATE BELOW 350 K, VERSUS 550 K FOR THERMOELECTRIC CELLS. THE REDUCED OPERATING TEMPERATURE INCREASES THE SIZE OF THE RADIATOR REQUIRED TO REMOVE THE WASTE HEAT FROM THE TPV SYSTEM. THE LOWER RADIATOR TEMPERATURE MEANS THAT THE THERMAL CONTROL SYSTEM REPRESENTS ROUGHLY A 25% SHARE OF THE LOCAL TPV SYSTEM MASS,VERSUS A 5% SHARE FOR A THERMOELECTRIC SYSTEM. BECAUSE THE THERMAL CONTROL SYSTEM REPRESENTS AN UNUSUALLY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF SYSTEM MASS, IT IS AN UNUSUALLY RICH TARGET FOR MASS REDUCTION. THIS PROJECT APPLIES INNOVATIVE LOW MASS AND THERMAL MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES TO A SYSTEM DURING A STAGE WHERE DESIGNED-IN SOLUTIONS CAN BE INTEGRATED. PHASE I IS DEVELOPING A PRELIMINARY DESIGN TO COOL TPV CELLSWITH LOW MASS HEAT PIPE RADIATORS. MASS IS REDUCED BY THREEDISCRETE MEANS: (1) USE OF LOW MASS COMPONENTS SIMILAR TO HEAT PIPE ENVELOPES ALREADY UNDER DEVELOPMENT; (2) REDUCTIONOF TEMPERATURE DROPS THROUGH THE USE OF A TWO-PHASE HEAT TRANSFER SYSTEM; AND (3) SAVINGS AT A SYSTEMS LEVEL BECAUSE ONLY THE TPV CELLS WILL BE IN CONTACT WITH THE HEAT REJECTION SYSTEM, MINIMIZING CONDUCTIVE LOSSES.",

The usual disruption in the oxidation state of the superconductor results in a significant degradation of the contact. Current contact technology utilizes noble metals such as Au, or Ag for the interconnections, but they are expensive and not compatible with AI or Cu interconnections found in most integrated systems. We have recently filed a Patent entitled, \"Bi-layer low resistance contact to High Tc Oxide Superconductors.\" The technique described in this patent will be shown in this proposal to allow a general methodology to fabricate very stable, low resistance contacts to high temperature superconducting devices. During Phase I we will investigate the mechanical and theriDal stability of bilayer contacts, initiate experiments to determine the optimum n)aterial for these systems, and e)ctend the methodology to tri-layer systerns. We will utilize XPS, Auger and electrical and ther m al measurements to evaluate these new systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Tristan will study a new class of very high Q superconducting structures based on a Photonic Band Gap (PBG) resonator. These structures are physically very different from superconducting cavities or pattered stripline structures, and have unique properties which may overcome many present limitations instate-of-the-art microwave devices. In conjunction with suitable amplifiers, PBG resonators have a variety of microwave applications, including exceptionally high speed AFC loops, ultra-stable oscillators with low phase noise close to the carrier, and precise frequency standards. Such devices are desirable for improving performance in many applications including radar and state-of-the-art communication systems. In order to achieve the full potential of these devices, we will extend this work to cryogenic systems incorporating superconducting cavities. In Phase I, a cryogenic system which can incorporate both high and low Tc devices will be built. We expect to achieve Q>10E5 at 77K using presently available high Tc thin films and Q>10E8 using low Tc materials. Recent work with room temperature PBG resonators at X band can create a true mono-frequency, narrow band oscillator. Numerical simulations to cover K and V bands and by analyzing possible modulation techniques will be performed.",

A CHEMILUMINESCENT DETECTION PROCEDURE USING 1,2-DIOXETANE SUBSTRATES FOR ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. WITH THIS METHOD, DNA SEQUENCING REACTION PRODUCTS LABELED WITH BIOTINYLATED PRIMERS ARE IMAGED FOLLOWING ELECTROPHORESIS BY TRANSFER OF THE SEPARATED DNA FRAGMENTS TO NYLON MEMBRANE, WITH 1,2-DIOXETANE SUBSTRATES. UPON DEPHOSPHORYLATION, THESE ENZYMATIC SUBSTRATES DECOMPOSE AND EMIT LIGHT. IN PHASE I, THE FEASIBILITY OF INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF DNA SEQUENCE INFORMATION THAT CAN BE IMAGED FROM ONE MEMBRANE WILL BE ASSESSED BY SEPARATING MULTIPLE SETS OF DNA SEQUENCING REACTIONS IN EACH LANE OF THE GEL, TRANSFERRING THE DNA TO NYLON MEMBRANE, AND DETECTING EACH SET OF SEQUENCING REACTIONS INDIVIDUALLY. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY UTILIZING MULTIPLE DNA SEQUENCING PRIMERS FOR THE DNA SEQUENCING REACTIONS. THE PRIMER FOR EACH REACTION WILL CONTAIN ITS OWN UNIQUE LABEL. EACH SET OF DNA SEQUENCING REACTIONS IS DETECTED WITH AN ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE CONJUGATE SPECIFIC FOR THE LABEL. THE PERFORMANCE OF VARIOUS LABELS AND ENZYME CONJUGATES IS EVALUATED. THE GOAL OF THE STUDY IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPTIMUM PROCEDURES FOR RAPID DETECTION OF EACH SET OF LABELED DNA FRAGMENTS.

AN INNOVATIVE CONCEPT FOR THE TRANSMUTATION OF ACTINIDE WASTES-MAINLY (237)NP, (241)AM, AND (243)AM-IS ALSO BEING INVESTIGATED. THE CONCEPT ENVISIONED CONVERTS THE ACTINIDES TO FISSILE NUCLIDES BY DOUBLE CAPTURE REACTIONS. AN EXAMPLE IS (237)NP (N,GAMMA) (238)NP (BETA DECAY) (238)PU (N,GAMMA) (239)PU. SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REACTION RATES FOR THESE CAPTURE REACTIONS ARE OBTAINABLE FOR ACTINIDE CONVERSION AND ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION AT MODERATED NEUTRON ENERGY RANGE, COMPARED WITH REACTION RATES FOR FISSION REACTIONS AT HIGH ENERGY (AS NORMALLY CONSIDERED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES). THE INTERMEDIATE, NONFISSILE NUCLIDES SUCH AS (238)PU IN THE CASE OF (237)NP, ACT AS CATALYSTS DURING THE TRANSMUTATION PROCESS AND MAINTAIN A CONSTANT INVENTORY AT EQUILIBRIUM.

INTERFERON SEEMS TO HAVE ESPECIALLY HIGH POTENTIAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF HERPES, CONDYLOMATA ACUMINATA AND OTHER SIMILARLY MANIFESTED DISEASE STATES. HOWEVER, SYSTEMIC REGIMENS ADEQUATE TO SUPPRESS SKIN SYMPTOMOLOGY OFTEN RESULTS IN ADVERSE SYSTEMIC EFFECTS AND STILL MAY NOT OVERCOME THE INACCESSIBILITY OF THE TARGET TISSUE TO THE DRUG. \"DRUG DELIVERY\" REMAINS THE SINGULARLY MOST LIMITING FACTOR TO THE EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF HERPES. LIPOSOMES RECENTLY HAVE RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION IN THE SEARCH FOR A MORE EFFECTIVE MEANS OF DELIVERING INTRINSICALLY ACTIVE DRUGS TO THEIR TISSUE TARGETS. IN RECENT STUDIES, WE HAVE SHOWN THAT LIPOSOMES FACILITATE SKIN DEPOSITION OF DRUGS AND THAT WHEN INTERFERON IS ENCAPSULATED IN A LIPOSOME, BY A TECHNIQUE WHICH FACILITATES ITS ASSOCIATION WITH BILAYERS, THE POLYPEPTIDE PENETRATES INTACT SKIN AND IS THERAPEUTICALLY ACTIVE; HOWEVER, INTERFERON INCORPORATED IN TRADITIONAL VEHICLES LACK THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY. THE GOAL OF THESE STUDIES IS TO CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE POSSIBILITY OF TREATING VIRUS-INFECTED EPITHELIAL CELLS WITH LIPOSOMALLY ENTRAPPED INTERFERON DELIVERED BY THE TRANSDERMAL ROUTE. SPECIFICALLY, WE WISH TO OPTIMIZE INTERFERON FORMULATIONS TO MAXIMIZE BOTH LIPOSOMAL ENTRAPMENT OF BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE INTERFERON AND ITS SUBSEQUENT DELIVERY THROUGH INTACT SKIN TO TISSUE INFECTED BY VIRUS. SINCE INTERFERON'S BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY IS LONG-LASTING WHEN IN LIPOSOMES, LIPOSOMES ALSO APPEAR TO OFFER A PRACTICAL AS WELL AS AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF DELIVERY OF INTERFERON TO LESION SITES.",

This system will greatly enhance the survivability and reliability of such systems through a modular approach to vehicle control. This approach allows the modern concept of modular vehicle system control, such as is used on aircraft, to be applied to AAVs. Several innovative features will be incorporated in the design. These are: 1. A compact, high torque, low inducrance brushless motor. 2. A compact, high power density PWM electronic driver. 3. A motor to driver commutation interface designed for high power thruput. 4. A very compact high strength gear reduction system. These features will be designed, analyzed via computer simulations and a layout of the mechanical system will be generated. The drive electronics will be packaged in an envelope compatible with the system. The resulting deliverable engineering model mock-up will demonstrate the packaging of a 12,000 lb-in output torque, 180 degree rotation system less than 8 inches in diameter and weighing less than 50 pounds. Power for the system will be supplied by 270 VDC power bus. Control commands will be input via the vehicle bus and could be proportional or bi-stable, depending on the overall system requirements. Alternately, a simple high/low logic command or an analog control signal could be used as input commands.",

THE PVTS RELIES ON A SMALL (LESS THAN 10 CUBIC INCHES), LIGHTWEIGHT (LESS THAN 1 LB.) FREQUENCY HOPPED TRANSMITTER WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THE UGV. NO TETHER OR HARD-WIRE CONNECTION FROM THE UGV TO THE CONTROL STATION IS REQUIRED. THIS SYSTEM WILL SUPPORT TRACKING OF MULTIPLE UGV'S SIMULTANEOUSLY AND CAN PROVIDE ORIENTATION INFORMATION IN ADDITION TO X, Y POSITION DATA. THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO COUNTERACT THE SEVERE MULTIPATH INTERFERENCE ENVIRONMENT RESULTING FROM OPERATION WITHIN A METAL BUILDING. THE DESIGN IS CONSISTANT WITH THE RUGGEDIZATION REQUIRED FOR OPERATION IN A SEVERE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT. THE OVERALL PROPOSED SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE PROCUREMENT AND LIFE CYCLE COST, ELIMINATE ACCURACY DEGRADATION WITH TIME AND TEMPERATURE, AND NOT INTERFERE WITH OTHER TEST FACILITY SYSTEMS. PHASE I PROGRAM OBJECTIVES ARE TO DESIGN, SIMULATE, EVALUATE, DOCUMENT AND PROVIDE A PROOF OF CONCEPT DEMONSTRATION FOR THE PVTS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE PROGRAM WOULD LEAD TO INSTALLATION OF THE PVTS INTO A ROBOTICS TEST FACILITY IN PHASE II.",

THE SPECIFIC GOAL OF PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT IS TO EVALUATE THE ANTI-HIV-1 EFFECTS OF THE NEUTRALIZING AGENTS, (HNA-2) AND/OR (HNA-3) AT DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS ON SEVERAL HIV-1 ISOLATES IN WHOLE BLOOD. KNOWN CONCENTRATIONS OF HIV-1 ISOLATES WILL BE ADDED TO BLOOD, AND THEN HNA-2 AND/OR HNA-3 AT DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS WILL BE ADDED. BLOOD SAMPLES WILL BE CULTURED IN SUPT1 AND JURKAT CELLS (CONTINUOUS T CELL LINES WITH A HIGH EXPRESSION OF CD4) FOR 30 DAYS. THE CELL CULTURE VIABILITY WILL BE EXAMINED BY STUDIES OF GROWTH KINETICS AND VITAL STAINING WITH TRYPAN BLUE AT DIFFERENT TIME POINTS. WEEKLY VIRAL PRODUCTION WILL BE MONITORED BY SYNCYTIUM FORMATION, DETECTION OF P24 VIRAL CAPSID PROTEIN, AND DETECTION OF PROVIRAL DNA BY POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR). FURTHERMORE, THE STABILITY OF THE NEUTRALIZING AGENT(S) IN TEST TUBES AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND THEIR EFFECTS ON DIFFERENT HIV-1 MARKER SCREENING TESTS WILL BE EVALUATED.

The target material of In(1-x)Ga(x)As was chosen because of its immediate use in the growth and fabrication of very high speed HEMT devices. The method should be applicable to other ternary compounds, giving a new field of \"substrate engineering\" to complement the \"bandgap engineering\" at present applied by epitaxy. The availability of substrates lattice matched to active layers will reduce strain and improve performance in devices such as II-VI lasers, solar cells, and HBTs.",

THE INITIAL APPLICATION OF THE DEVICE IS TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME CORRECTIONS TO AREA MEASUREMENT OF REGIONS OF DYSPLASIA. THIS TYPE OF MONITORING IS OF INCREASING VALUE IN COLPOSCOPIC EXAMINATIONS AND IS EASY TO PERFORM WITH A VARIETY OF SYSTEMS. UNFORTUNATELY MOST PHYSICIANS ARE UNAWARE THAT CONVENTIONAL 2D AREA MEASUREMENT ALGORITHMS CAN INTRODUCE SUBSTANTIAL ERRORS WHEN APPLIED TO A 3D SURFACE, SUCH AS THE CERVIX. SOME PHYSICIANS ARE NOW USING THIS METHODOLOGY TO MAKE SERIAL MEASUREMENTS OF THE SIZE OF A CERVICAL LESION TO GUIDE TREATMENT DECISIONS. IT IS, THEREFORE, IMPORTANT THAT THE MEASUREMENT BE PERFORMED PROPERLY AND ACCURATELY. THE SYSTEM WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL. THE APPROACH IS TO PROJECT A GRID OF KNOWN GEOMETRY ON THE CERVIX, RE-IMAGE THE GRID AND APPLY A MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE 3D TOPOGRAPHY OF THE TISSUE IN THE FIELD OF VIEW. USING THIS DATA, CORRECTIONS ARE THEN APPLIED TO THE AREA MEASUREMENT ALGORITHM TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SHAPE OF THE CERVIX AND THE SPECIFIC ANGLE AT WHICH IT IS VIEWED DURING THE CURRENT EXAMINATION. THIS IS AN INNOVATIVE NEW APPLICATION OF A RECENTLY DEVELOPED METHODOLOGY. BECAUSE OF ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE A WELL DEFINED, HIGH CONTRAST TARGET IMAGE, IT HAS A VERY HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS.

The mirror of an industrial laser is therefore the critical component of a high value system in a large market. XEMET's technology creates mirrors that not only resist thermal distortion by removing several KW/sq-cm., but also detects distortion and acts to off-set it in real time, holding the mirror shape invariant under very high pulsed loading. In addition to reducing the errors of the optical train the mirrors will be very resistant to catastrophic damage. The technology is completely passive and does not require support equipment and does not introduce jitter as do other approaches.",

BECAUSE THE MAXIMUM COUNT RATE FOR A SINGLE DETECTOR AT A GIVEN ENERGY RESOLUTION IS LIMITED, ARRAYS OF DETECTORS ARE BEING CONSTRUCTED TO INCREASE TOTAL COUNT RATES. THIS APPROACH IS NOW RESTRICTED BY THE COST, PHYSICAL SIZE, AND COMPLEXITY OF THE REQUIRED ANALOG PROCESSING ELECTRONICS. INITIAL STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING DIGITAL PROCESSING ELECTRONICS BASED ON CONCEPTS OF DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING. THESE STUDIES SUGGEST THAT IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO MATCH THE RESOLUTIONS OF CURRENT ANALOG SYSTEMS WHILE INCREASING PROCESSING SPEEDS BY FACTORS OF 2 TO 6 AND DECREASING BOTH COSTS AND PHYSICAL SIZES BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. THIS PROJECT'S OVER-ALL GOAL IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS ACTUALLY POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUCT SUCH DIGITALLY BASED SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS. IN PARTICULAR, THIS WORK AIMS TO IDENTIFY OPTIMUM FILTER DESIGNS, EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE FILTERS WITH REAL PRE-AMPLIFIERS, AND DEVELOP AN IMPLEMENTABLE DESIGN USING COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE HARDWARE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. IN PHASE I, DIGITIZED RECORDS OF DETECTOR PRE-AMPLIFIER OUTPUTS ARE BEING COLLECTED AND USED AS INPUT DATA FOR MODELING THE BEHAVIOR OF DIGITAL FILTER DESIGNS. THE PERFORMANCE OF VARIOUS DIGITAL FILTER DESIGNS IS BEING INVESTIGATED. AN EXPLANATION IS BEING DEVELOPED OF THE FEATURES THAT RESULT IN SUPERIOR FILTER PERFORMANCE, AND OPTIMIZED FILTER DESIGNS ARE BEING DEVELOPED. SYSTEM LEVEL DESIGNS FOR THE OPTIMIZED FILTER ARE BEING PRODUCED, AND ANY CHANGES IN THEIR EXPECTED PERFORMANCE AS A RESULT OF ENGINEERING TRADE-OFFS OR HARDWARE RESTRICTIONS ARE BEING EVALUATED.

        "abstract": "Abstract         2Superconductors, materials that carry electrical current without any resistance, can make electronic circuits more efficient and communications between remote locations easier. In the past two years, the materials developments of superconductors have progressed so much that the quality of the materials can no longer be measured even with the most sophisticated techniques. Xsirius Superconductivity, Inc is developing a new measurement technique using lasers to scan the surface of the superconductors to measure the quality. This new measurement technique improves detection sensitivity by 100 times. This technique will be useful for developing superconducting materials for use in computer chips, communication systems, and particle accelerators.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         IN THE TREATMENT OF THE DYNAMIC PROBLEMS OF STRUCTURES, TWO ALTERNATE TESTING METHODS, BASED ON EXTERNAL AND EMBEDDED SENSORS, EXIST IN THE LITERATURE. IF THE SENSORS RESPOND TO THE CHANGES IN THE DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STRUCTURE, AND/OR THE ENVIRONMENT, THEN THEY ARE REFERRED TO \"SMART\" STRUCTURES. SMART SENSORS AND SMART MATERIALS HAVE BEEN USED FOR DETECTING STRUCTURAL DAMAGES AND/OR CONTROLLING THE VIBRATION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STRUCTURES. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW MATERIALS, AND IN VIBRATION PHENOMENONS SUCH AS MODE LOCALIZATION AND TRANSITION HAVE MADE THE RESEARCHERS TO LOOK FOR WAYS OF COMBINING THE TWO IN ORDER TO MORE EFFECTIVELY ALTERING STRUCTURAL RESPONSE TO DYNAMIC LOADS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A MORE EFFICIENT AND PRECISE SMART STRUCTURES BASED ON SMART MATERIALS, SUCH AS SHAPE MEMORY ALLOYS, AND/OR EMBEDDING SENSORS, SUCH AS OPTICAL FIBERS, AND VIBRATIONAL PHENOMENONS SUCH AS LOCI CROSSING AND VEERING, AND MODE LOCALIZATION AND TRANSITION. IN PARTICULAR, SUCH PHENOMENONS WILL BE ENFORCED ON THE STRUCTURES SO THAT THE UNDESIRED VIBRATIONS ARE CONFINED TO A SMALLER REGION, AND THEREFORE EASIER TO DETECT AND CONTROL. SHAPE MEMORY MATERIALS AND OPTICAL FIBERS WILL BE USED TO DETECT AND CONTROL THE PARAMETERS THAT ARE MORE CRUCIAL IN VIBRATION RESPONSE OF THE STRUCTURE. SUCH COMBINATION WILL RESULT IN A HUGE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF THE SENSORS, SIGNIFICANT GAIN IN COMPUTATIONAL SPEED, AND IMPROVING THE ACCURACY OF THE CONTROL SYSTEM. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE OUTCOME OF THIS SBIR PROJECT WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENT IN THE FIELD OF SMART STRUCTURES. IT WILL ENHANCE THE CAPABILITIES OF THE SYSTEMS USED BY DOD, NASA, AEROSPACE AND OTHER COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIES. THE COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF SUCH DEVELOPMENT INCLUDE DAMAGE CONTROL, CONFINEMENT OF STRUCTURAL VIBRATIONS, AND VIBRATION CONTROL WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY OF STRUCTURES.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Auxiliary bearings will be critical components of advanced gas turbine engines using magnetic bearings to support the engine spools.  Because of the high temperature in the bearing compartments conventional oil-lubricated bearings cannot be used either as the main or auxiliary bearings.  Although solid-lubricated bearings under development are capable of supporting high loads at high temperatures, their short lifetime limits their use for man-rated aircraft engines.  A novel auxiliary bearing design for magnetically supported rotors in high-temperature gas turbine engines has been developed.  The design incorporates a pressurized gas bearing and solid lubricated touch sleeves to achieve a bearing system with extended life at high temperatures, no wear during normal operation, and significant over-capacity to handle aircraft maneuvers.  The auxiliary bearing design integrates the pressurized gas bearing into the magnetic bearing stator, resulting in a compact systems with synergistic benefits to both the magnetic and gas subsystems.  In Phase I the feasibility of the proposed bearing concept was assessed by developing a preliminary design of the hybrid magnetic/gas bearing and characterizing the auxiliary bearing performance.  In Phase II, we propose to build and test a set of hybrid bearings.  Creare will work with engine manufacturers in Phase III to incorporate the auxiliary bearings into advanced turbine engines.",
